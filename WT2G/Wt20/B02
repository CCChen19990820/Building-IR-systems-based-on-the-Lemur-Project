<H2>Radiation in perspective:<BR>
Improving comprehension of risks</H2>
<P>
<I>Report of an international conference that explored why radiation risks are so commonly misunderstood</I>
<P>
<A HREF=#author><B>by Franz-Nikolaus Flakus</B></A>
<HR>
<font size=+3>O</font>ver the past century, few nuclear issues have commanded as much public and scientific attention as those related to radiation. Based on the scientific record and public debate, one clear message has emerged: radiation's real and perceived risks are commonly misunderstood. There are significant gaps between what scientists have documented about radiation effects and what the public generally believes to be true. Communication of the facts has proved difficult at best.
<P>
At local and national levels, efforts to bridge communication gaps have been central ingredients of nuclear information programmes for many years. At the global level, the problems now are being more directly addressed. In late 1994, the IAEA co-sponsored the first major international meeting principally devoted to the comprehension of radiation risks. (<A HREF=#footnote>*</A>) More than 400 health and regulatory authorities, social scientists, radiation experts, journalists, and nuclear communicators from 50 countries and nine international organizations attended the <A HREF=radiationc.html>week-long conference</A>. Held at the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris, it was organized at the invitation of France and hosted by the Institut de Protection et de Sûreté Nucléaire (IPSN).
<P>
This article highlights selected issues discussed at the conference, and offers some insights into the challenge of improving the communication about, and the comprehension of, radiation and its associated risks.
<P>
<H3>The scientific record and public perception</H3>
<P>
The conference featured technical sessions devoted to topics and case studies that have been particularly sensitive to misinterpretation in the past.  Selected topics are briefly reviewed here.
<P>
<B>Assessment of radiation health effects</B>. According to our current knowledge, two main types of health effects induced by exposure to ionizing radiation are distinguished: effects mainly linked to cell killing (e.g. skin burns) called <I>deterministic effects</I>, and effects linked to cell modification (e.g. cancers or genetic disorders) called <I>stochastic</I> effects. Deterministic effects develop above a threshold and the severity of the effect increases with dose. For stochastic effects, the <I>probability</I> of occurrence increases with dose. Carcinogenesis involves a multistep process. A relatively long latency period is needed before clinical diagnosis can be made. 
<P>
Stochastic effects of radiation are today not distinguishable from similar effects of other causative agents (e.g. tobacco, chemicals). Consequently, their occurrence can only be established in epidemiological studies comparing exposed and unexposed population groups. Effects of low radiation doses can be estimated only if a large number of persons is included in such studies. The most important <A HREF=legacy.html>epidemiological study</A> in this context has been the one done over the past 40 years of the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Estimates of cancer risk from this survivors' study have been confirmed by other studies, including one on a large number of nuclear workers from Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
<P>
Information on genetic disorders is based only on animal experiments and epidemiology could not demonstrate these effects. For the assessment of the risk represented by the carcinogenic effect of radiation, several assumptions have to be made and models have to be used. For most cancer localizations, the excess risk linked to radiation is proportional to the spontaneous cancer rate in the human population. 
<P>
What late effects have been found on populations living in high altitude areas or where there are increased radiation levels, for example on monazite sands or in houses having high levels of radon? The findings of some studies reported at the conference indicate little risk of cancer induction in such groups. 
<P>
Our scientific knowledge of radiation effects promises to expand in years ahead. Advances in modern molecular biology, for instance, might make it eventually possible to determine the sensitivity to ionizing radiation of an individual person and also to determine if a cancer or genetic disorder is caused by radiation or not.
<P>
<B>Impact of radiation on the environment</B>. A central part of this conference session concerned the protection of plants and animals. The protection of people from radiation may not always provide adequate protection to plant or animal life. This can be the case when plants and animals live near potentially harmful sources of exposure that do not affect people living farther away. Experts at the conference pointed out that this situation is exceptional. For more common cases -- namely those where humans, plants, and animals live in the same location -- measures to protect humans from potentially harmful radiation exposure will also ensure protection of other species.
<P>
Harm to the environment caused by radiation is almost entirely associated with accident conditions or the use of nuclear weapons. There is no evidence that the routine operation of nuclear facilities has caused environmental harm. In fact, participants urged that greater emphasis should be placed on the positive effects of nuclear power, including the role it is playing to reduce levels of emissions linked to environmental pollution and climate threatening processes.
<P>
In some countries proposals are being made for establishing environmental protection criteria for radiation. Conference participants noted that this could be seen as giving a misleading signal to non-radiation scientists and the public.  While there may be ethical and other reasons for wishing to establish such criteria, the rules should be developed universally for all pollutants in the environment rather than for a single one. 
<P>
<B>Perception of radiation risk. </B>The perception of risk depends on many factors, including the context in which the hazard occurs, the type of hazard, and the type of person who makes the judgments. 
<P> 
People are normally not especially concerned about circumstances which they believe they can control. Social debates and public outrage are easily triggered by scenarios of events that could have severe consequences but that are unlikely to occur -- so-called high consequence/low probability events. There also seems to be a general tendency of people to respond more strongly to future threats than to future opportunities or benefits.
<P>
Some individuals reject nuclear activities because they do not accept additional risk in a society where there are already too many risks, while others are more favourable to nuclear development. Among most people, however, the most common attitude towards nuclear installations -- or other types of major industrial projects -- is "not in my backyard". Their emphasis is on the actual or perceived negative impacts that very often overshadow the positive sides of the industrial project or technology. 
<P>
The reaction often reflects cultural, political, and ideological influences, as well as issues of credibility. Often, the main consequence of a large accident is the loss of people's confidence in the ability of authorities to manage the complex social and technological system. Confidence may return if authorities follow a policy of openness, take public demands into account, and become proficient in communicating both the risks and benefits.
<P>
Overall, perceptions of radiation risk can be more confounding than one might think. In the case of perceptions of health risks from exposure to radon in homes and buildings, the public generally believes the risks are <I>lower</I> than scientific estimates would substantiate. Several factors appear to contribute to this attitude: the voluntary nature of the risk, its connection with the home, the fact that there is no person or industry imposing this risk, and that it is not possible to say with certainty that a particular cancer victim has died from radon exposure. 
<P>
<B>Cancer and leukaemia clusters</B>. The conference featured discussion of various studies on what are commonly called "cancer clusters". Discussions pointed out that it is almost impossible to distinguish a <I>post-hoc </I>cluster, which has arisen by chance, from one which is due to a locally caused excess risk. The correct scientific method is the <I>a priori</I> investigation of putative sources of risk. Such studies of childhood leukaemia around nuclear installations, for example, have been carried out. They reveal little, if any, evidence for an increased risk of childhood leukaemia. 
<P>
Also discussed was the problem of media coverage and communication with the public. It was suggested that, when informing the public on these issues, scientists should not only point out that "the risk is low". They should try to look at the issue from the public's point of view, and take into consideration factors that may be influencing the perceptions of risk.
<P>
<B>Radioactive waste disposal and the environment</B>. Technical and philosophical aspects of high-level waste disposal -- including the capability for making safety predictions far into the future for radioactive waste repositories -- were central features of discussion on this topic. Scientists acknowledged the inevitable uncertainties involved in making predictions over such extended time periods. At the same time, they emphasized that several different ways exist for providing assurance of safety. Confidence in long-term assessments is enhanced by comparisons with natural analogues in the environment. 
<P>
Concerning waste transport between countries, discussions pointed to the importance of rules and practices that prevent movement of waste materials to countries without the resources and technology to handle them. A currently accepted position -- determined more on political than on safety or economic grounds -- is that each country should solve its own radioactive waste problems. A potentially beneficial approach, considering the number of small countries which have to deal with radioactive waste problems, would be regional repositories serving their needs.
<P>
<H3>The media, scientists, and decision-makers</H3>
<P>
In three media fora, scientists, journalists, policy-makers, and other conference participants explored factors relating to perception and communication of radiation risk, and the influence of media and the public on policy making.
<P>
The scientific facts about radiation risk and media approaches to communicating risk need to be distinguished. Messages of scientists are necessarily based on statistics. The public essentially wants to know whether there is a risk or not. However, most people find the quantification of probability difficult to understand, and find it hard to accept that probabilities can never be zero. While the public generally regards the risk from natural radiation as inevitable, people do not want more risks and uncertainties added to their lives.
<P>
For scientists, the fora made some important points about effective communications. An important role of the scientist is to supply reliable information, without speculation, to build trust. Since openness is a prerequisite for credibility, scientists should provide simple information and make more detailed backup material available for further reference. 
<P>
Communication should also be immediate.  What comes out first strikes the public. Later messages seem to come from a defensive stance and are basically weak ones. In debate, scientists should be willing to discuss both bad and good news to gain credibility and build trust. Trust among scientists and journalists further could be strengthened through topical seminars and workshops.
<P>
The conference session on decision-making was directed at senior policy officials. Ministerial-level officials were invited to talk about the rationale and strategy for decision-making involving radiation issues. A number of points were addressed, including the question of how public perceptions, expert opinions, and persuasive types of communication influence the decision-making process.
<P>
The session emphasized that decision-makers should take into account some basic elements when dealing with radiation issues:  they should acknowledge the risk to be dealt with, state their commitment to protection, and then act upon that commitment.  Overall, the aim must be to create a climate in which the public is convinced that all aspects, including bad news, are fully  explored, and where varying views receive a complete and proper hearing.  Toward that end,  political structures and processes, as well as media channels, can be positively used. Additionally, the importance of having legislation in place that is clearly communicated to the public was stressed, so that the laws and principles upon which risks are controlled can be understood.
<P>
<H3>A step forward</H3>
<P>
As a global pioneer in its field, the Paris conference marked a significant step forward in a process that undoubtedly will require far more time, attention, and resources. Better communication, and greater comprehension, of radiation risks will require a concerted effort among scientists, journalists, decision-makers, and the public.
<P>
One clear message of the conference is that difficulties in communication of radiation safety differ from country to country. Moreover, actions  to ameliorate the situation need to be tailored to prevailing issues of national debate -- for example, radon issues in the United States, or <A HREF=cheracc.html>Chernobyl health effects </A>in Ukraine and Belarus.
<P>
The conference also underlined the difficulty of expressing scientific facts of radiation effects in a form useful to non-specialists, and it helped illuminate the roadblocks to better comprehension. A clear message was that greater efforts are needed to place radiation issues in perspective, by improving communication of comparative studies about radiation risks and other hazards.
<P>
There seem to be no magic recipes for bringing about quick changes to the complex problem of comprehending radiation risks. Yet the Paris conference represented an important step forward by bringing together people closely involved in framing and communicating solutions.

<H2>Understanding radiation risks:<BR>
Lessons from Paris</H2>

<IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/rosen.gif ALIGN=LEFT ALT="">
<font size=+2>C</font>omprehending radiation risk is a real and major problem confronting society today. Perhaps every professional working in this field has had experiences similar to one I will share with you. Frequently during my air travels, I enter into a conversation with my neighbour  -- generally, a well educated professional. In a few minutes he discovers that I am involved in nuclear safety and inevitably the conversation turns to questions about radiation and its health effects.
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
"What can you tell me about Hiroshima or about the vast environmental contamination caused by Chernobyl?" I usually begin my answers by explaining that as we speak we are being constantly bombarded by a broad range of radiation, not only from the cosmos, but also from the food we are consuming. That seemingly new and troublesome point is followed by my comments explaining that the many victims of Hiroshima were not killed directly by radiation, but by the explosion and the heat wave created from the nuclear detonation. Of the 80,000 survivors who received very high doses of radiation, less than 500 have incurred illnesses so far which are attributable to the radiation exposure -- a statement that is also new and received with disbelief. But the figures are scientifically factual. About 8000 survivors have indeed died from solid cancer tumors, but epidemiological studies indicate that less than 500 can be attributed to radiation effects. The remainder are normal tumors of the type that will threaten all of us, whether survivors of Hiroshima or not. It seems that most of us, even the professionals, do not realize or want to acknowledge that cancer is a very common occurrence. Twenty five percent of us will incur a fatal cancer. 
<P>
The answer to my neighbour's second question concerning Chernobyl elicits the same disbelief. Certainly the fact that the entire environmental contamination of Chernobyl has produced a global radiological impact equivalent to an additional world exposure to 20 days of natural background radiation is more difficult to comprehend, let alone understand. The same is true of the health effects to the surrounding population which, except for the apparent, expected, and regrettable increase in thyroid cancer in children, will be sufficiently small so as not to be discernible through epidemiological studies.
<P>
Why does my neighbour not believe me? Certainly, his perception of the facts is different from mine. Why? Many of us have been very pessimistic about our ability to deal with the public's comprehension of radiation risk. Radiation is mysterious; it is invisible, intangible, odourless, silent, and associated with warfare. 
<P>
To explore this issue in more depth, the IAEA in October 1994 organized upon the invitation of France an <A HREF=radiationc.html>International Conference on Radiation and Society: Comprehending Radiation Risk</A>. It was the first major international meeting devoted to the subject, and attracted more than 400 participants from 50 countries and nine international organizations.
<P>
The conference sought to bring about a better comprehension of the risk attributed to the exposure to ionizing radiation. This is an important and serious subject for all of those concerned with the uses of atomic energy and ionizing radiation for health applications, improving the food supply, generating electricity, and producing consumer and industrial products. The large audience -- a unique mixture of technical specialists, social scientists, decision makers, and media professionals -- was an indication of the high level of interest in radiation and how individuals and society perceive its effects. The conference's goal was not a further elaboration of technical information, but a better comprehension of radiation risk. And by comprehension the Conference had certainly desired to promote not only an understanding of the scientific facts of radiation health effects, but also and more importantly an ability to express these facts in a form useful to the public and the decision makers.
<P>
The goal was ambitious, perhaps too ambitious.  The conference had only limited success in satisfactorily dealing with the question of the comprehension of radiation risk.  Yet the concerned specialists may have gained some better insights as to where the roadblocks to better comprehension lie. There are many.
<P>
Scientists too often speak to themselves and this pattern was very evident during many of the conference sessions. There could have been more efforts to present facts and conclusions in an understandable and communicative language. Some specific examples may be illuminating:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>It would have been useful to further discuss the implications of some remarkable facts among the 80,000 survivors of Hiroshima. Fewer than 500 have so far incurred a fatal cancer attributable to radiation exposure -- and the average loss of life expectancy among the survivors is about 1 year while those that have incurred the fatal cancer had their life cut short by 10 years.
<P>
<LI>It would also have been desirable to discuss the reported thyroid nodules cases in the Marshall Islands and in Nevada by not only confirming that large exposures to radioactive iodine produces cancer nodules, but by also referring to the rather relatively small number of cases involved.
<P>
<LI>As for the Chernobyl studies, speaking about a 2500% increase in thyroid cancers in children ignores the importance of the accuracy of the pre-Chernobyl reference value for these studies, which surely involves major uncertainties. It would have added more to the comprehension of health effects to have expressed the results as five cancers per 100,000 children and to refer more precisely to the total number of cancers to be expected in the various regions. An unemotional discussion of the clinical outlook for these children would also have been useful.
<P>
<LI>There were a number of references to cardio-vascular effects of radiation. This effect must be clearly qualified  by indicating the many compounding factors and the more likely cause, which is other factors such as stress.
<P>
<LI>In the discussion of cancer clusters, such as leukaemia clusters, it is necessary to repeatedly emphasize that clusters always exist in nature. They have been found long before nuclear power existed and are also found in locations remote from nuclear installations -- and that in any case the number of excess cancers are few. Discussion of the Seascale cluster (reported in the 1980s in the United Kingdom) lingers on although most involved scientists believe it is not in any way connected with radiation. Why are the profound limitations of linking clusters to any cause not clearly and repeatedly stated? Furthermore, in much of the scientific community, epidemiology is recognized as an observational science with severe limitations. Epidemiological studies often involve small numbers of excess cancers with substantive compounding factors, such that for most situations positive as well as negative results must be taken with caution. The profound limitations of epidemiological studies should also be clearly and repeatedly stated.
<P>
<LI>There was a need for further discussion in Paris of why there are so many differing national policies concerning radon control and the reasons for this.
<P>
<LI>Finally, there was a very conspicuous limited use of comparison in most presentations. Comparisons could enable the radiation risk to be put into some perspective with other risks and at the same time also introduce the notion that life involves many risks along with benefits.
<P>
<LI>On the positive side, the conference format chosen for this meeting was helpful in conveying information and promoting audience participation. The use of a rapporteur and chairman to present information and lead discussions has proven successful in many recent IAEA meetings. Using this format, the conference systematically covered the technical aspects, followed this by some particularly relevant case studies, and then brought in the media and decision makers. The carefully chosen format  thus facilitated meaningful discussion. As a whole, the sessions and the conference have been a significant step ahead in a process which undoubtedly will require additional time and attention. 
</UL>
<P>
The IAEA can help this process. One of its functions is to advise on how to develop standards and practices which adequately speak to the needs of constituents -- the scientists, the social scientists, the decision makers, and the public. The deliberations at the conference will surely provide the Agency with insights into how to make this function more effective.
<P>
The IAEA, together with the European Commission and the World Health Organization, has also organized a major international meeting in April 1996 to further look at the health and environmental consequences of the Chernobyl accident -- 10 years after the disaster. It is hoped that, after the meeting, there will be a better comprehension of the radiological consequences of Chernobyl.

Nuclear Power Option

<BODY>
<H2>Nuclear power:<BR>
Keeping the option open</H2>
<P>
<I>Though slowed in some countries, nuclear power development is rapid where the demand for electricity runs high</I>
<P>
<A HREF=#author><B>by L.M. Davies and A.D. Boothroyd</B></A>
<HR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>G</FONT>enerating electricity from nuclear power is a well-established technology. More than 30 countries were operating or building altogether more than 480 nuclear power plants at the end of 1994. Collectively over the past 40 years, the world has accumulated over 7200 operating years of experience with nuclear power, and the plants have generated about 20,000 terawatt-hours of electricity.
<P>
The increasing world population, the universal desire for an improved standard of living, and improving economic conditions will all lead to an increase in global demand for energy. The problems are compounded by the need to study and then reduce the emissions from burning fossil fuels. These factors inevitably mean an increase in demand for electricity. In the developing world, for example, electricity demand is increasing at a higher rate than either energy consumption or gross national product.
<P>
The choice of electric power sources in a country will depend upon many factors. They include existing capacity, availability and cost of fuel, capital funds, and political conditions. Many countries will adopt an approach which provides a balanced mix of fuel sources to guard against price and supply "shocks". Generating companies will also seek to stabilize the security of supplies and electricity prices to their customers. Diversity is seen as a key benefit for stabilizing the supply and cost of electricity. In this context, nuclear power will remain a viable option for future electricity generation.
<P>
In the industrialized world, the rate of demand for new nuclear power plants will be tempered by various factors. They include the magnitude of current excess generating capacity, the replacement rate of old and relatively inefficient conventional fossil burning plants, and the demands of meeting international agreements on the control of emissions. But in the developing world, the availability of money and other resources may be the controlling factor in the rate of implementation. The situation is not simple.  Currently, the demand for energy appears to have saturated in some regions of the world. However, this is thought to be mainly due to economic recession and the social changes in Central and Eastern Europe, rather than any underlying medium or long-term trend in energy usage. The demand in the rest of the world continues to increase inexorably and this is where the majority of the world's population lives.
<P>
In short, the global energy and electricity picture has changed over the past decade, with demand strongest in countries experiencing healthy economic growth. In September 1994, this changing picture and nuclear power's place within it were examined at the International Conference on the Nuclear Power Option held from 5-8 September 1994 at the IAEA in Vienna. About 150 participants from 37 countries and six international organizations attended. Recently, the IAEA published the proceedings of the conference. This article reviews selected issues raised at the conference that are influencing nuclear power's future development.
<P>
<H3>National and regional nuclear growth</H3>
<P>
As they do today, various factors could impede the use of nuclear power in years ahead.  They are related to issues of public acceptance, radioactive waste management, safety, economics, the environment, and legal liability. 
<P>
In many countries developing nuclear power programmes, many of these factors have been addressed and overcome. National and regional reports at the conference from Eastern, Central and Western Europe, North and South America, and Asia indicated that nuclear power is well established, economic, and a significant source of electricity. Over the long term, continuing demand for electricity is expected to lead to greater nuclear development, as well as investment in other options. In these regions, nuclear power is seen to be competitive and environmentally advantageous. 
<P>
The rate and timing of nuclear growth will vary between countries. Worldwide, nuclear power can be expected to continue to grow at the present level of three to eight gigawatts (GWe) per year, though increases of 10 GWe per year and higher are projected early in the next century.
<P>
At the national level, the prospects for growth are generally tied to economic and energy conditions, based on conference reports. In  China and India, where energy demand surpasses supply, the limited availability of capital and other resources has served to constrain nuclear development though its growth is considered urgent.  Russia, Ukraine, and other Eastern European countries also have urgent and continuing needs to improve and increase their generating capacity, but they face serious difficulties. In Latin America, countries generally have well-defined needs for electricity yet have a shortage of resources. In France, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, nuclear programmes are robust. In North America, where utilities currently have excess generating capacity, an expansion of nuclear power, as well as other sources, strongly depends on the pace of electricity demand. 
<P>
<H3>Plant management and performance</H3>
<P>
Among the conference's key topics was the management and performance of nuclear power plants.
<P>
In many countries, lessons have been  learned from problems encountered during plant construction and operation. Equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures, as well as training programmes, have been upgraded. In some countries, the need to improve project management skills was identified as especially important, particularly for countries moving from a centrally planned to a market driven economy.
<P>
Greater cooperation and communication between operators of nuclear plants have resulted in improved performance. The World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) reported that the operational availability of plants has increased while the number and severity of reportable incidents has decreased. A report from Nuclear Electric in the United Kingdom described a remarkable improvement in the performance of their advanced gas-reactors over the past 4 years, with load factors increasing from 40% to 79%. By taking a broad approach to safety culture, Nuclear Electric has been able to take advantage of lessons to be learned from a wide range of industries. Through research programmes, for example, a study of the management and organizational factors behind recent severe accidents in nuclear, chemical, transport, space, and petroleum industries has been conducted with the aim of determining organizational characteristics that would prevent such accidents. These studies and other national and international programmes have led to considerable progress over the last 5 years in efforts to improve safety culture and hence the safe performance of plants.
<P>
A number of reports emphasized the value of opening plants to outside international safety reviews and publishing performance data in the IAEA's Power Reactor Information System (PRIS), particularly from the standpoint of public perceptions. One report analyzed the good production record of WWER-440/230 plants, a fact that contrasted with safety concerns expressed about these plants. The performance of the successor design, the WWER-440/213, has been generally better, whereas that of the larger WWER-1000 has not been quite as good as expected. 
<P>
<H3>Economic and related issues</H3>
<P>
With regard to the economic viability of nuclear power, studies carried out by the IAEA, Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA), International Energy Agency (IEA), and Union of International Producers and Distributors of Electricity (UNIPEDE) show that electricity generation costs for nuclear plants are closely competitive with those for coal and gas-fired plants. However, the economic margin in favour of nuclear generation has declined in recent years, primarily because of increases in operation and maintenance costs for nuclear plants, at least in several countries.
<P>
Projected costs for plants that could enter service around the year 2000 or shortly thereafter show that nuclear power should be able to continue to compete with fossil plants. Whether nuclear is the cheapest option will differ from country to country, and will be strongly influenced by the price of fossil fuels and by the costs and duration of construction. 
<P>
It is essential, if the nuclear option is to be competitive, that nuclear projects be well managed during construction and operation. New nuclear plant designs, drawing upon the lessons learned from existing plants, should lead to plants that are simpler and cheaper to construct, while maintaining high safety levels. Improvements in fuel performance, including higher burnup, together with the trends towards lower prices for uranium and fuel cycle services, will lead to stable or declining nuclear fuel cycle costs. 
<P>
In addition to being economically competitive, nuclear plants are beneficial from the environmental viewpoint, since they do not emit any greenhouse gases or other damaging air pollutants, such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Thus, nuclear power can play an important role in strategies aiming towards limited or reduced levels of greenhouse gas emissions.
<P>
<B>Quality assurance.</B> The management of quality in nuclear power organizations and equipment suppliers varies quite widely across the industry. The efforts that have been made to produce documented systems and to audit compliance with those systems has often resulted in little benefit in quality terms. The IAEA and several regional organizations have long since recognized the problems. Highly pragmatic solutions are now emerging in line with and in many cases ahead of developments in the broader industrial scene. The evolution of quality management into a "culture" which promotes improved performance of all staff, not just addressing the production of "quality" documentation, was described. Performance-based quality management, which focuses on processes, provides a refreshing approach to the assurance of quality. The approach is described in a recently revised IAEA code and supporting guides prepared for publication in 1995.
<P>
<B>Siting and plant life.</B> Other topics receiving close attention at the conference related to the siting and operational lifetimes of nuclear plants. A number of participants emphasized the importance of retaining existing sites, and of maximizing the operational lifetimes of plants for economic reasons.
<P> 
Extending the lifetimes of existing plants reduces the demand for new ones and defers decommissioning and its associated waste disposal requirements. Although there seems to be no technical impediment to the construction of a  large number of new plants, the limiting factor could be associated with choice of new sites. With the time approaching for decisions about the construction of new plants, whether or not such decisions are made, plant lifetimes are extremely relevant to keeping the nuclear option open. How long a nuclear plant operates is predominantly a business decision of the owner, even though associated regulatory requirements are mandatory. For building new plants, given the 10-year lead time for licensing, construction, and commissioning, participants stressed the importance of taking decisions now to meet needs early in the next century.
<P> 
<B>Public attitudes.</B> On the matter of public attitudes toward nuclear power, both Japan and France commended the advantages of the "good neighbour" approach by utilities. The importance of creating "symbiosis" between plants and the community was emphasized. Building trust comes from listening to the issues raised by the community and from an open approach to communication. This technique is also employed in other countries, with communities near power stations in particular. The Russian public, during the current crisis of the national economy, was said to perceive nuclear power as an "island of stability".
<P>
It was also noted that, in the United States, public support was often underestimated, which leads to hesitation by government officials and others to speak out and take strong action in support of nuclear energy. New approaches are being taken to improve the industry's understanding of public concerns.
<P>
<H3>Waste and nuclear safety issues</H3>
<P>
Presentations covering the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste all emphasized that safety was the paramount consideration. France described the development of a complete inventory of all radioactive waste in the country and reported that media coverage of that activity had been generally favourable, again demonstrating the value of openness in gaining public confidence. Several speakers noted that technical solutions for waste disposal existed, but more progress in establishing sites and demonstrating the reliable operation of operational waste disposal facilities in the near term was vital to public acceptance of the nuclear power option.
<P>
The session on safety included topics related to safety assessment methods and implementation of a safety culture. Some speakers emphasized the need for cost effectiveness of safety improvements, a view not shared by the regulatory community. Concern was expressed about a proposed feature of some new plant safety requirements, namely that no accident should require off-site emergency planning. This would cause much difficulty if it was intended to be applied retroactively to existing plants. There was strong general agreement and support for the need to keep demonstrating the safe and productive operation of current plants, a fact that would help sustain public confidence. 
<P>
<B>Nuclear liability.</B> Based on discussion surrounding a joint IAEA and NEA paper, there is disagreement between East and West on the question of liability for accidents. Participants from Eastern countries generally expressed the view that suppliers should remain responsible in the event of equipment malfunction, while those  from Western countries generally endorse the concept of limited liability and place responsibility with the operator of the plant.
<P>
<B>Human resources and training.</B> The need to attract and train more qualified staff was noted with some concern. Again, public perceptions about nuclear's prospects were noted. They were generally seen as a factor behind the lack of interest in nuclear-related studies at high school and university levels. The contraction and diversification of nuclear research and development institutes also has led to a serious reduction of available qualified staff, which will take many years to rebuild. Governments were urged to take action soon to ensure that this trend is reversed if they wish to preserve the nuclear power option.
<P>
<H3>A mixed picture</H3>
<P>
The demand for and interest in nuclear power are seen to be increasing but it is not homogenous. In his closing remarks, Dr. Boris Semenov, the IAEA's Deputy Director General for Nuclear Energy and Safety, noted that the conference had  reached consensus on the continued viability of the nuclear power option, and that in many countries, it was the preferred option as a proven, economically competitive, and environmentally sound technology. However, he pointed to a number of prerequisites for expanding nuclear development. They include the safe and reliable operation of existing nuclear power plants; the need for convincing solutions to waste storage and disposal problems; and a predictable licensing process. These provisions, together with a supportive and consistent government policy, are needed to achieve greater public acceptance of nuclear power, which he said constitutes probably the most important prerequisite.
<P>
He concluded by noting that these tasks cannot all be accomplished at once. However, steps must be taken soon to sustain the nuclear power option in the best interests of meeting the world's electricity and environmental needs.

Training for safety and reliability</H2>
<I>The best international practices are being emphasized to help countries strengthen nuclear plant training programmes</I>
<P>
<A HREF=#author><B>by F. Mautner-Markhof and K.V. Madaheva Rao</B></A>
<HR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT> central challenge for industries anywhere is to maintain safe and reliable operation of their plants and facilities. These objectives cannot be achieved solely by improvements in equipment and hardware. They critically depend upon the qualifications, experience, and competence of people carrying out various tasks and holding different levels of responsibility.
<P>
In the nuclear power industry, training has assumed increasingly greater importance over the past 15 years. During this period, several studies have shown that human error has been a major contributing factor to incidents at nuclear power plants.  In turn, these errors often can be traced back to deficiencies related to training.
<P>
Over the years, the IAEA has established a range of services directed at helping countries strengthen their training practices, approaches, and facilities for nuclear power personnel.  This article reports on Agency programmes in the context of international developments in the field.
<P>
<H3>Key elements of evolving approaches</H3>
<P>
A strong emphasis on safety has characterized the development of nuclear power technology. In the early years,  personnel involved in plant design, construction, and operation were pioneers in nuclear technology and the strength of their base of knowledge was able to offset any weaknesses in training, which was evolving simultaneously. Training techniques used for staff of conventional power plants were first adapted to suit the requirements of nuclear plant operations personnel. In the 1970s, as nuclear  technology entered its commercial industrial phase, the tendency was to develop more specific operating procedures in increasing detail. Training programmes were designed accordingly, this time for a new generation of operators having different educational and professional qualifications.
<P>
In 1979, the Three Mile Island (TMI) accident in the United States jolted the industry. It challenged the belief that such an accident could not happen, particularly in the Western industrialized world, given the emphasis on safety and the defense-in-depth strategy adopted in the design, construction, and operation of nuclear power plants. The accident's root cause was traced to human errors, and inadequate training and qualification. In prompt response, the US nuclear industry voluntarily formed the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) and subjected the prevailing training methodology to a critical review. Borrowing from techniques used in military training, a systematic approach to training (SAT) was developed and an industry-wide commitment to SAT was made in 1981. In addition, training programmes of nuclear utilities were reviewed by INPO accreditation teams to promote a uniform standard of training across the board.  At the same time, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission strongly urged that SAT be used as the basis for training nuclear power plant personnel, and it mandated full-scope simulator training. As a result of these and other measures, US nuclear utilities have achieved a sustained improvement in all plant performance indicators.
<P>
Following TMI, other countries with operating nuclear power plants also conducted detailed analyses of their plant designs, as well as operations and maintenance procedures. They made necessary modifications, and in most cases, they strongly recommended the use of SAT. Most countries with significant nuclear power programmes now use SAT as the basis for developing, implementing, and evaluating their training programmes for nuclear power personnel. Although many countries do not have systems for formal accreditation of training programmes, important elements of SAT and of an accreditation process have been incorporated in their training programmes.
<P>
The critical role of operations personnel has been rightly emphasized by every country with a nuclear power programme. Maintenance training, however, has received far less attention and there is widespread agreement that it must be improved. The competence of maintenance personnel is essential for reducing events connected with equipment failure or malfunctioning systems.
<P>
<H3>Training techniques and methods</H3>
<P>
Personnel who are properly trained and qualified for jobs and responsibilities at nuclear power plants are not available directly from university-level institutions or technical colleges. New recruits therefore have to be trained in areas going beyond their academic or vocational qualifications. Existing staff also require continuous training to maintain and upgrade their skills and knowledge.
<P>
These diverse types of training can be provided at a dedicated training centre at a nuclear power plant; at a centralized training facility serving the needs of a number of similar nuclear plants; or at a national training facility. External training organizations also can provide specific types of training. Whichever approach is followed, the training site must have facilities for classroom teaching, workshops with mock-ups and models for maintenance training, and simulators for operations personnel with attendant workshops and laboratories. Training on full-scope or partial nuclear plant simulators serves the goals of both safety and reliability, and these two cannot be treated separately. Simulator training has become one of the most effective and important means for upgrading the skills and attitudes of operations personnel.
<P>
Another important component is on-the-job training (OJT). The trainee performs the required work under the close supervision and with the assistance of the responsible supervisor. Thus, he or she becomes an integral part of a team that subsequently has to function well. Although the effectiveness of OJT is enhanced by educational qualifications and classroom training, it cannot be replaced by theoretical training. 
<P>
Simulator, OJT, and other types of training should be based on SAT. It is also important to emphasize the need for top-quality trainers with good teaching skills. They should have practical and up-to-date experience, as opposed to only academic experience and qualifications.
<P>
<B>An overview of SAT.</B> The Systematic Approach to Training (SAT) is a process which encompasses the analysis of training needs and the competencies required to perform a given job; the design of training to meet these needs, which involves converting the competence requirements into training objectives including identification of appropriate training tools and settings; the development of training materials and tools such that all objectives can be met, as well as the training of trainers; the implementation of training according to the procedures and materials developed (training can be implemented in the classroom, workshop, simulator, and by self-study and OJT); the evaluation of training performance during and at the conclusion of training; and feedback of evaluation results into the relevant phases and parts of the training process and programmme, as well as to other needed plant improvments. SAT is thus a logical and self-improving system. It goes from identifying tasks and competencies required for performing a job to the implementation and evaluation of training for those competencies.
<P>
The use of SAT offers significant advantages over more conventional training approaches. In essence, it is a quality assurance process for ensuring the competence of nuclear power plant personnel, and for helping management more effectively monitor and improve training policies and practices. 
<P>
SAT is now recognized as the international best practice for training nuclear power plant personnel. The approach can be adapted to suit the specific requirements and conditions of individual nuclear power plants, utilizing and building upon existing capabilities. It also incorporates aspects that promote a safety culture among staff and management. Regulatory bodies in a number of countries mandate or strongly recommend the use of SAT-based training for nuclear personnel.
<P>
<H3><A HREF=support.html>IAEA assistance and support</A></H3>
<P>
IAEA programmes in nuclear power training are helping countries to apply the best international practices in their efforts to improve the qualifications and competence of their operations, maintenance, management, and technical support personnel. Toward this end, an International Working Group on Nuclear Power Plant Personnel Training and Qualification has been set up. Its objectives are to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>provide advice and comments on the IAEA's current and future activities related to a broad integrated SAT-based approach to training and qualification of nuclear power plant personnel;
<P>
<LI>establish mechanisms through the IAEA to provide countries with information, recommendations, and advice on nuclear power plant personnel training and qualification;
<P>
<LI>promote exchange of information on national programmes, new developments, and experience from operating nuclear power plants and training centres;
<P>
<LI>promote the effective implementation of relevant IAEA standards, guides, and other documents at the nuclear power plant level through training programmes and related activities.
</UL>
<P>
The IAEA has recently prepared a new <I>Guidebook on Nuclear Power Plant Personnel Training and its Evaluation</I>, a revision of an earlier technical document (TECDOC-525) that had become the widely used international standard reference on SAT. This new guidebook reflects the experience gained in SAT implementation over the past 6 years.  It emphasizes a broader concept of competence which includes not only technical knowledge and skills but also knowledge, skills, and attitudes concerning human factors. It further covers the role and responsibilities of management; the training of maintenance and management personnel; more effective and efficient methods of SAT analysis; and evaluation of the overall training process.
<P>
Another document, <I>Simulators for Training Nuclear Power Plant Personnel</I> (TECDOC-685), provides guidance on the procurement, establishment, and utilization of a simulator training centre. Other IAEA activities include the preparation of guidelines for designing nuclear power plant training simulators, and for using related assessment methodologies;  the organization of regional and national workshops on the use of simulators and on the application of SAT in designing simulator-based training programmes; and the development of training performance indicators to facilitate management's monitoring of programmes.
<P>
IAEA training advisory services are further provided at the request of countries. The services are technical in nature and are not an auditing mechanism. Rather, training experts provide practical advice and guidance on the best ways to meet the needs and priorities of a specific nuclear power plant or country.
<P>
In Hungary, the IAEA under its technical cooperation programme has started a model project to strengthen training for operating and maintenance personnel at the Paks nuclear plant.  It specifically aims to introduce SAT-based training,  to assist in establishing a training centre for maintenance personnel, and to enhance safety culture. The project is serving as an example for other nuclear power plants in countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Its successful completion in Hungary can serve as a model for similar types of nuclear plants operating elsewhere in the region.

<H2>Nuclear energy for seawater desalination:<BR>
Updating the record</H2>

<I>Results of IAEA-supported studies show a range of combinations and options for tapping the earth's seas and oceans</I>

<P>
Worldwide availability of potable water greatly exceeds the amounts needed and used, but resources are not evenly distributed. There are regions where water is scarce, and where the population is already at the mercy of inadequate supplies. Seawater constitutes a practically unlimited source of supply. When desalted, it can contribute to the solution of growing water problems, wherever the sea is accessible. Desalination, as all industrial processes, requires energy.
<P>
Fossil energy resources are limited, however,  and their increasingly intensive use raises environmental concerns, including the threat of a gradual climate change with far-reaching consequences. At the same time, worldwide demand for energy is steadily growing, and adequate solutions are needed.  Nuclear energy contributes significantly to the world's existing supply of energy, and it has the potential to do even more. Realizing this potential, however, is not an easy challenge.
<P>
This article reviews the national and global interest in using nuclear energy in seawater desalination processes. It further reports on recent IAEA studies examining the possibilities and potential of nuclear desalination today.
<P>
<H3>The early years</H3>
<P>
Combining the use of nuclear energy with the industrial process of supplying potable water by seawater desalination has been considered as far back as the 1960s. Indeed, it was characterized at that time by great optimism regarding the use of nuclear energy. Several studies were undertaken by individual countries, organizations, and nuclear industries. At the request of its Member States, the IAEA performed several technical and economic studies between 1964 and 1967, which were issued in the Technical Reports Series (Nos. 24, 51, 69 and 80).
<P>
At that time, there was considerable interest in promoting the use of nuclear energy for a variety of applications in addition to generating electricity.  Applications included ship propulsion, district heating, energy supply to remote locations, industrial process steam supply, and seawater desalination.  The idea of large agro-industrial-nuclear complexes was also pursued.
<P>
At a time of strong public and political support, these nuclear energy applications did not remain at the study stage, but proceeded to prototypes and demonstration projects. For seawater desalination, the design and construction of the Shevchenko complex (now Aktau in Kazakhstan) was launched by the former Soviet Union. The BN-350, a liquid-metal-cooled fast reactor, went into operation in 1973, and since then has provided both electricity and heat for the production of potable water.
<P>
What happened after the early efforts and achievements is now history.  Developments in the nuclear field were concentrated in large power reactors for electricity generation, and the BN-350 is still the only power reactor in the world being used to supply heat for industrial-scale desalination. In Japan, several small-scale seawater desalination plants have been installed in large nuclear power stations for producing feedwater and miscellaneous services. There are also about 16 small desalination plants installed on Russian nuclear icebreakers and other nuclear-powered ships.
<P>
No further projects have been undertaken regarding the combination of nuclear energy and seawater desalination. Major developments, however, have taken place in both nuclear power and in desalination technologies, and several studies have been done.
<P>
<H2>Renewed interest</H2>
<P>
At the 1989 session of the IAEA General Conference, renewed interest was expressed in the potential of nuclear reactors for seawater desalination. The Conference adopted a resolution [GC(XXXIII)/RES/515] which requested the IAEA to assess the technical and economic potential of nuclear desalination. Since then, this subject, under the title  Plan for Producing Potable Water Economically , has remained on the agenda of every General Conference, and successive resolutions have directed the Agency to further pursue relevant activities.
<P>
The importance of having adequate supplies of clean potable water for growing populations   coupled with the magnitude of problems involved in satisfying this need   is now globally recognized. Less known is that desalination, which during the 1960s constituted an emerging technology with a status comparable to nuclear reactors for electric power at that time, has become an established commercially available process, with further potential for improvements.
<P>
Nuclear reactors for electric power have also matured. Even though they have become a technically proven and economically competitive source of energy which supplies about 17% of worldwide electricity consumption, they have been plagued by problems of public and political acceptance in many countries. With reduced prospects for further penetration into the electricity supply market when compared to earlier expectations, interest in other applications, in particular seawater desalination, has reappeared.
<P>
A number of other factors are propelling the technology of nuclear desalination forward. They include growing concerns about the environmental effects of burning fossil fuels; recognition of the benefits of diversification of energy sources; the development of new advanced reactor concepts in the small- and medium-power range; and interest in achieving higher efficiency in energy consumption processes.
<P>
Since the renewal of the IAEA's activities concerning nuclear desalination, a growing number of countries and international organizations have expressed interest, participated in meetings, and provided information and support. The assistance and support, involving more than 20 countries, has included the provision of expert services and funds totalling US $570,000.
<P>
<H3>Recent IAEA reviews and studies</H3>
<P>
Following the 1989 General Conference, the IAEA took steps to update its review of available information on desalination technologies and the coupling of nuclear reactors with desalination plants. Results were reported in a 1990 technical document (TECDOC-574), Use of Nuclear Reactors for Seawater Desalination.
<P>
After the status review, the IAEA prepared and issued a report in 1992 entitled Technical and Economic Evaluation of Potable Water Production through Desalination of Seawater by Using Nuclear Energy and other Means (TECDOC-666).  This report contained an assessment of the need for desalination based on recent analysis of the world's potable water resources; information on the most promising desalination processes and energy sources; and a review of nuclear reactor systems proposed by potential suppliers. It specifically evaluated the economic viability of seawater desalination by using nuclear energy in comparison with fossil fuels. The study encompassed a broad range of both nuclear and fossil plant sizes and technologies in combination with various desalination processes. Other aspects, such as environmental and institutional issues, were also discussed. The IAEA is continuing to collect and analyse relevant information on suitable nuclear reactors, desalination processes, coupling aspects, and potable water demand.
<P>
In 1991, in response to a request for assistance submitted by five North African States (Algeria, Egypt, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Morocco, and Tunisia) a regional feasibility study on nuclear desalination was launched. This study was presented to the participating countries this year.
<P>
Saudi Arabia has also requested IAEA technical assistance for a feasibility study on nuclear desalination. Work on this study was started in 1993, and is expected to be concluded by 1996.
<P>
Other work is being carried out in response to a resolution of the 1993 General Conference concerning demonstration facilities of nuclear desalination. As a first step, a study is being perfomed to identify, define, and characterize a practical set of options from which one or more demonstration facilities might be chosen. Work on this  options identification programme  started in 1994, and is expected to be concluded by 1996.
<P>
These activities, studies, and reports are not isolated efforts. Rather, they have been performed in a combined way, following a logical sequence, and complementing each other. They illustrate the IAEA's roles of facilitating the exchange of information and the transfer of knowledge and experience. In this way, it can serve as a catalyzer, organizer, or co-ordinator of nuclear desalination projects, and as a provider of technical assistance. The IAEA cannot, however, take a leading role for practical applications of nuclear desalination, nor can it design, build, own, or operate nuclear desalination complexes.  
<P>
<H3>Combinations, options, and prospects</H3>
<P>
There are various regions in the world, and many specific locations in a number of countries, where water demand exceeds supply and where seawater desalination constitutes the only or the best available supply option. There are, however, no reliable databases which would permit global quantitative estimates of water deficits.  
<P> 
The IAEA's studies have found that the North African and Gulf regions are characterized by overall water scarcity. As an input to the North African feasibility study, the region's participating countries analyzed their respective water demand and supply situations and available options for increasing supply. They identified a series of specific locations, with production demands for seawater desalination ranging from 20,000 to 720,000 cubic meters per day by the year 2005. Indeed, the countries of the region already have had to use fossil-fueled energy for desalination to supply their growing needs for potable water. Presently, there is an installed desalination capacity of the order of a million cubic meters per day in the region. In Saudi Arabia, the water supply is even more dependent on seawater desalination; the currently installed capacity is around four million cubic meters per day.
<P>
Though better knowledge of the current situation and more precise forecasts of the evolution of demand and supply are needed in these regions, there is no doubt that desalination will be required in increasing amounts to complement surface and diminishing groundwater resources.
<P>
Due to the relatively high cost of seawater desalination independent of the energy source used, this option is currently only relevant for the supply of potable water for personal, domestic, and industrial use. For widespread irrigation in agriculture, the costs are still too high. This restriction is expected to prevail for at least several decades. Among available desalination processes, three have been selected for study. These are the RO (reverse osmosis) process, the MED (multi-effect distillation) process, and the MSF<%0> (multi-stage flash distillation) process.
<P>
It has been found that there are no technical impediments to the use of nuclear reactors as an energy source for seawater desalination. Nuclear reactors could provide electricity or heat, or both, as required by the desalination processes. Regarding nuclear safety, the same principles, criteria, and measures would apply as to any nuclear power plant. An additional requirement is that the product water would have to be adequately protected against any conceivable contamination.
<P>
Practically any type of nuclear reactor could provide the energy needed for desalination. Technical, and in many cases also economic information, was collected on about 20 reactor concepts from potential vendors. These concepts correspond to different stages of design and are mostly in the small- and medium-power range. The amount of energy   either in the form of heat or electricity or both   that can be supplied by nuclear reactors in this power range is typically more than enough even for very large seawater desalination plants.  For example, a desalination plant with a capacity of one million cubic meters per day could supply an urban concentration of three to four million people with sufficient potable water for domestic use.  Such a desalination plant using the RO process would require a nuclear plant having an installed capacity of about 300 megawatts-electric.  This same urban concentration of people also would require between 4000 to 6000 megawatts-electric of installed capacity to provide their corresponding electricity needs.  Hence, nuclear power plants in the upper end of the small- and medium-size power range, and certainly the large-size nuclear power plants, would only constitute suitable choices when they are intended to supply electricity to consumers in addition to energy for seawater desalination. Thus, there is no reason why nuclear reactors could not supply both requirements simultaneously, and take advantage of the economic benefits accruing to large-size nuclear plants. 
<P>
In the North African feasibility study, it was assumed that the nuclear reactors would be integrated into the electric grid system, and the size of the reactors would only be limited by the grid size, i.e. not larger then 10% of the interconnected capacity. With this assumption, the options considered were in the small- and medium-power range, except in Egypt, where even large-size reactors could be utilized.
<P>
With the methodology applied and the assumptions adopted, the economic assessment in the 1992 IAEA generic study has shown that the use of nuclear reactors as an alternative option to the use of fossil fuelled plants would in general be economically competitive for medium- and large-size nuclear plants supplying electricity only or electricity and heat that are integrated into the electric grid system. Water production costs would generally be between US $0.7 and $1.1 per cubic meter. Combinations with plants supplying only heat result in considerably higher water production costs.
<P>
The economic assessment performed within the scope of the North African feasibility study confirmed these earlier results. In this assessment, the economic data provided by the potential vendors were used, instead of the parametric values adopted in the generic study.
<P>
The results obtained in such assessments are considered suitable for indicating economic feasibility. However, firm prices as contained in formal tenders would be needed prior to investments.
<P>
The studies performed have shown that a very large number of possible combinations exist between the many different reactor concepts, the various desalination processes, and the different coupling schemes. The options identification programme now under way is expected to identify the most practical approaches, and determine the associated demonstration requirements.
<P>
The institutional issues regarding nuclear desalination are fundamentally those corresponding to any nuclear power project. In particular, the development of suitable local infrastructure constitutes a challenge to any country starting a nuclear programme. Experience has shown that this can be done, though it does involve major efforts sustained over a relatively long period of time.
<P>
The North African feasibility study has shown that it is possible to perform such a study in co-operation with countries on a regional level. It has also shown that there are mutual benefits, if a common approach and joint efforts are applied. Several subject areas appear to be of particular interest for regional co-operation. These include the development of databases, and activities related to technology transfer; nuclear safety; regulatory infrastructure; local participation; and the development of human resources .
<P>
The work done within the framework of the IAEA's nuclear desalination programme over the past 5 years has shown what can be achieved through cooperative approaches involving active national participation and related technical and financial support.
<P>
All the results so far illustrate that the application of nuclear energy to seawater desalination is a realistic option. The challenge ahead is to demonstrate its use by proceeding with effective development and practical applications.

<I>A look at how nuclear and isotope techniques help find ways to improve poor soils and sustain the world's crop production</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF=#reference>by Christian Hera</A></B> 
<HR>
<P>
Land represents a mere 29% of the world's total area, yet provides approximately 98% of its food. Most of this land is not very fertile: only 11% is of high fertility, 28% of moderate fertility, and 61% of low fertility. 
<P>
At the same time, land, nutrient, crop, and water management practices in most developing countries are quite poor. Mining, for instance, causes soil deterioration which is no less dangerous than any other form of environmental degradation. This is one reason why the protection of nutrients and water is a major concern in many parts of the world, especially in developing countries. 
<P>
Efforts to minimize soil losses and replenish nutrients are essential. Many organizations are paying increasing attention to the development of an integrated plant nutrition system. The basic underlying concept is the maintenance and possible increase of soil fertility for sustaining crop production through the best use of all possible sources of plant nutrients.  This approach is ecologically, socially, and economically viable.
<P>
Nuclear and related isotope techniques are an important part of such agricultural solutions. They normally are used to compliment conventional or classical techniques in agricultural research, and they provide data that other methods cannot. This article looks at how nuclear techniques have been, and continue to be, used in soil and crop research. To a significant extent, their use has been stimulated by the combined efforts of the IAEA and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. Since 1964, they have conducted programmes through the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, headquartered at the IAEA in Vienna. 
<P>
<H3>The historical perspective</H3>
<P>
Research with isotopes dates back to 1923 and the work of G.V. Hevesy, which signified the start of isotope applications in soil and crop research. Some 35 years later, in 1959, the newly formed IAEA awarded its first research contracts to Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany to support studies on the efficiency of fertilizer use. Starting in 1962, research contractors from developing countries, and agreement holders from developed countries, were integrated through IAEA co-ordinated research programmes (CRP). The first two CRPs initiated by the IAEA were also in the area of soil fertility. They focused on the application of isotopes to rice fertilization (1962-68) and  on plant nutrient supply and movement in soil systems (1962-68).
<P>
Since then, dozens of CRPs have been conducted. All told over the past three decades, the Joint Division's Soil Fertility, Irrigation and Crop Production Section has had the technical responsibility for 29 CRPs. Much of the research was inspired by some of the world's top soil scientists, including Mac Fried, who became the first Director of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division, and Hans Broeshard, who headed the Agricultural Laboratory at Seibersdorf. Their pioneering efforts left their mark on soil scientists all over the world.
<P>
From the very beginning, the use of isotopes and related techniques proved to be extremely valuable for increasing the efficiency of fertilizers and optimizing plant nutrition, among a wide range of other applications. Using an isotope to label a nutrient in fertilizer or in soil, for example, is an invaluable direct method to distinguish between the amount of the nutrient that plants take up from each source.
<P>
<B>Fertilizer studies.</B> Over the past 30 years through activities of the Joint Division, the use of isotope techniques has largely been directed at studies of fertilizer efficiency for major food grain crops, such as rice, maize, and wheat. The main objectives have been to achieve higher and more stable grain yields by maximizing the uptake of nutrients from applied fertilizers and other sources, and to simultaneously reduce potential harmful environmental effects. For instance, fertilizers labelled with nitrogen-15 have been applied to a crop in different ways (sources, timing, placement) to determine and measure its uptake. The research helped scientists identify the most efficient methods of fertilizer application for different soils and climatic conditions.
<P>
In the first rice fertilization programme (1962-68), one question was the relative efficiency of different sources of nitrogen when they were applied on the surface or incorporated in the top five centimeters of soil. Field experiments using ammonium nitrate, whose two main components were labelled with nitrogen-15, were carried out in five countries. The results clearly demonstrated which component was the most effective source of nitrogen to paddy rice, and how it should be applied. The highest uptake of nitrogen was obtained when ammonium was incorporated beneath the soil. Placement had no significant effect on the utilization of nitrate.
<P>
A highly successful CRP was on maize fertilization, in which eight countries participated. Studies sought to examine the best ways of applying fertilizer in the fields, compared with the classical application of broadcast spreading on the soil surface followed by ploughing. Fertilizers labelled with nitrogen-15 and phosphorus-32 were used. Results led to the conclusion that farmers should split the amounts of fertilizer they apply and spread them in different ways (called banding) and at different times in the growing cycle.
<P>
Results were put into practice in Romania. Seeders were equipped with special devices for applying fertilizer at seeding time, and cultivators for weed control were equipped with devices for applying fertilizer at the vegetation period. They were used during maize production on an area of two million hectares. Over a period of 6 years, an average yield increase was realized of 0.62 tonnes per hectare, as compared to yields obtained through the classical fertilizer method. 
<P>
The investment for adapting to the new method represents only 5% of the total value of the yield increase that can be obtained every year. The method's advantages are even greater when taking into account that it eliminates the supplementary work, and possible associated negative soil effects, involved in classical fertilizer application.
<P>
<H3>Nitrogen from the atmosphere</H3>
<P>
In spite of the abundance of nitrogen in the atmosphere (78% of all gases), it is one of the most limiting factors for crop growth. Only certain crops can directly use atmospheric nitrogen. Overcoming this limitation through the application of nitrogen fertilizer represents one of the major costs of crop production. 
<P>
A process  known as biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) has become a feasible alternative for farmers in both developing and developed countries. Legumes and a few other families  in symbiosis with appropriate microorganisms are able to directly utilize atmospheric nitrogen through this process. It offers several advantages, including less expense, reduced pollution hazards, enhanced soil fertility, and greater protein content of crops. To realize these gains requires the proper management of nitrogen fixing systems.  Nitrogen-15 isotopic techniques can provide quantitative and integrated values of nitrogen fixed in both natural and agricultural systems. 
<P>
During the last two decades, several FAO/IAEA international research programmes have focused on measuring and enhancing BNF, especially symbiotic legume fixation in various systems. Current programmes emphasize the improvement of both yield and nitrogen fixation in grain legumes through an integrated multidisciplinary approach.
<P>
Results so far show large nitrogen fixation differences between the grain legumes species. For some, such as fababean, the process works rather effectively, while for others, such as common bean, it does not. These differences were persistent under a wide range of environmental conditions.  Also considerable genotypic variations in nitrogen fixation between cultivars of common bean were found in different countries.
<P>
Of particular interest in BNF are nitrogen fixing trees. Studies show them to be an important component of agricultural systems. They play a significant role in restoring or increasing soil fertility and in decreasing soil erosion, and they grow well in nitrogen-deficient soils. Methods that can accurately measure factors affecting the growth of such trees under different conditions have been, and continue to be, studied.
<P>
Other studies have focused on the role played by blue-green algae and their association, particularly Azolla, in lowland rice fields.
<P>
High yielding rice varieties linked to the  green revolution  require large amounts of expensive chemical nitrogen fertilizers. Scientists have long recognized that the aquatic nitrogen fixing Azolla-Anabaena symbiosis could replace at least part of the nitrogen requirement for rice. From 1984-89, a programme with financial support from the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA) was coordinated by the Joint Division's Soil Fertility, Irrigation and Crop Production Section to investigate the benefits of using Azolla as a biofertilizer for rice.  Scientists from nine rice producing countries   Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Hungary, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand   participated.
<P>
Although the Azolla-Anabaena symbiosis has been used for centuries as a green manure for rice in parts of China and Viet Nam, intensive scientific research only began after the 1973 oil shock dramatically increased the cost of nitrogen fertilizers. Azolla can grow very rapidly, doubling its weight in three to four days under optimal conditions. Yet before this programme began there was little evidence from field experiments to indicate whether the nitrogen accumulated by Azolla in the field was primarily drawn from the atmosphere or from the soil. Although there was substantial evidence to show that incorporating Azolla into the soil increased rice yields, only a few experiments had been done to explore the reasons for this.
<P>
With extensive use of the nitrogen-15 labelling technique, it was shown that 70% to 80% of the nitrogen in Azolla is derived from atmospheric fixation, and that there was no evidence of significant competition with rice for limited soil nitrogen. In fact, the most recent experiments have shown that a cover of Azolla floating on the surface of rice floodwater can even improve the efficiency of chemical nitrogen fertilizers. Urea is the most common nitrogen fertilizer used for rice. However, its efficiency is usually low and 50% or more can be lost to the atmosphere. Hydrolysis of urea in the water produces an alkaline reaction, and combined with the effects of algal photosynthesis, pH values over nine are commonly observed. At this pH level, ammonium is converted to the volatile gas ammonia. Azolla fortunately limits algal growth through shading of the floodwater. Following fertilizer applications, pH values one to two units lower were observed when Azolla was present. 
<P>
The second effect is that Azollatakes up part of the nitrogen  fertilizer from the water. If the Azolla is then incorporated into the soil, this nitrogen fertilizer becomes available to the rice along with the fixed nitrogen. In an experiment in Fuzhou, China, losses of nitrogen from a urea top dressing applied 2 weeks after transplanting were reduced from 50% without Azolla to 25% when the field was inoculated with Azolla at transplanting. Uptake of labelled fertilizer by rice was increased from 26% to 35%. In Thailand, application of urea at transplanting with and without inoculation with Azolla resulted in yield increases of 10% to 15% in plots with Azolla.
<P>
When Azolla was incorporated into the soil, it proved to be as good as urea as a nitrogen source for rice. Not only the uptake of nitrogen from Azolla was equal to that from urea but there was also the additional benefit that more of the nitrogen added as Azolla remained in the soil after harvest. In some of the tests, there was sufficient nitrogen available to the next crop to produce a yield increase of two to three times compared to urea, particularly when wheat followed the rice crop. Estimated savings from one crop of rice by the use of Azolla as a nitrogen fertilizer are substantial. (See graph.)
<P>
This successful programme demonstrated that a group of scientists from different parts of the world could work together, use the same critical methodology, and make rapid progress toward common goals. Since the studies were done in a wide range of environments, the results can be widely applied.
<P>
<H3>Photosynthesis and water use</H3>
<P>
Isotope techniques are indispensable in studies of photosynthesis, plant metabolism, translocation, and nutrient uptake. By exposing plants to carbon dioxide labelled with carbon-14, photosynthesis and movement of metabolites throughout the plant can be monitored using techniques such as autoradiography. Recently, carbon-13 has been increasingly employed in tracer studies because of its greater availability and the ease with which it can be measured. Moreover, as a stable isotope, carbon-13 is environmentally friendly and therefore invaluable in studies of soil organic matter and greenhouse gases. However, plants discriminate against carbon-13 during photosynthesis.  Though it varies depending on the plant species, the discrimination is closely associated with a plant's ability to utilize water. 
<P>
This technique can be useful for selecting cultivars of crop and tree species efficient in water use. Through one CRP, several genotypes of food crops and trees have been identified in poor soils that are highly efficient in the use of limited resources of water. In Morocco and Tunisia, genotypes of wheat have been found that are efficient in water use and produce high yields. In Sudan, provenances of the gum arabic tree Acacia Senegal have been identified which are highly efficient in growing in drought-prone regions. In Sri Lanka, the technique further has assisted scientists in identifying cultivars of coconut that are highly tolerant to drought and therefore eminently suitable for cultivation in the dry region of the country.
<P>
A recent research project, initiated in 1990, is investigating the effective use of scarce water resources to maximize plant productivity. The use of neutron moisture meters and other related techniques have helped assess irrigation practices and schedules. The meters were used successfully not only to measure the soil's water content but also to understand water dynamics under field conditions.  Another CRP has examined the efficiency of water and fertilizer use in semi-arid farming systems. Since semi-arid zones, by definition, are deficient in rainfall, plant growth and crop yields are heavily dependent on the proper management and conservation of water. The research helped to identify measures for ensuring that crops receive an adequate amount of nutrients under such farming conditions.
<P>
<H3>Environmental protection</H3>
<P>
Alongside the need for improving agricultural productivity, many countries, mostly industrialized ones, share a problem of a different kind, namely the entry of nitrogen into groundwater and pollution of drinking water and lakes.  In this case, there are simultaneous needs to protect existing and potential agricultural soils and nitrogen resources, and to meet the rising standards of environmental protection worldwide.
<P>
Nitrogen-15 provides a particularly powerful tool for studying the behavior of fertilizer nitrogen in the environment. With the support of Germany, the Soil Fertility Section of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division has carried out an international programme that provides key guidance for addressing problems.  Based on the studies that were done, a number of conclusions were drawn. They include:
<UL>
<LI>Taking into account the prospects and time needed for developing alternative agricultural practices, conventional nitrogen fertilizer applications must continue to intensify and extend for the immediate decades ahead.
<LI>As a result of this intensification, increasing amounts of nitrogen both in native soil and added as fertilizer will be lost from the soil-plant system and find their way into the environment. Soil-nitrogen levels and contingent productivity can nevertheless be maintained by developing improved soil-nitrogen management practices.
<LI>In some situations, the nitrate levels in ground and drinking water are likely to continue rising. A proper diagnosis of the various sources responsible for this problem should be made.
<LI>In developing countries, the losses of fertilizer nitrogen represent those having a relatively high cost input. In the more advanced industrialized countries, on the other hand, the higher amounts utilized represent an addition to the problems and costs of environmental quality and health protection. The data generated and the information reviewed suggest that these problems can be contained by improved soil and water management in agricultural systems. In particular there appears to be a huge scope for a better exploitation of alternative nitrogen sources, such as biological nitrogen fixation in legumes and non-legumes and/or biofertilizers.
<LI>The United Nations agencies, such as the FAO, IAEA, United Nations Environment Programme, and World Health Organization, through improved collaboration with appropriate regional and national programmes, have a vital and urgent role in implementing the required improvements and short-term research needs, and accelerating the simultaneously needed education and training.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Supporting services and activities</H3>
<P>
Several activities are simultaneously carried out to ensure the transfer of nuclear technologies for agricultural development. The Soil Science Unit at the FAO/IAEA Agriculture and Biotechnology Laboratory in  Seibersdorf offers a range of research and training support. 
<P>
<B>Training courses.</B> Annual interregional training courses on the use of isotopes and radiation techniques in studies of soil-plant relationships have been conducted at the Seibersdorf Laboratories since 1978. Each training course usually lasts 5 to 6  weeks and can be attended by 20 participants from all geographical regions. Additionally, national and regional training courses are supported.
<P>
<B>Fellowship training.</B> About 10 scientific fellows are trained at the Seibersdorf Soil Science Unit every year. There are two categories of fellows.  Analytical fellows are accepted for a period of 2 to 3 months to learn isotope analytical techniques used in soil-plant research studies (for instance, nitrogen-15 assay techniques by optical emission spectrometry). This form of training includes technical tutoring and hands-on practical sessions. Research fellows are accepted for periods of 6 to 12 months to work on a topic within the FAO/IAEA's work programme. They receive guidance on experimental strategies and use of isotope and related techniques relevant to a particular area they will pursue upon return to their home country. They are expected to complete and write a piece of research work.
<P>
Additionally, the IAEA sponsors scientific visitors for short stays, typically for senior scientists. Other training-related opportunities for scientists of both developed and developing countries include selection as cost-free interns, cost-free experts, or associated professional officers.
<P>
<B>Research support.</B> Through CRPs and other mechanisms, extensive international and regional research networks have been built over the years.  The FAO/IAEA Soil Science Unit provides a range of supporting services. They include the analysis of approximately 15,000 to 20,000 samples every year for projects in developing countries. Nitrogen-15 labelled fertilizers also are dispatched to participants in specific research projects. Analytical support further is provided to laboratories in developing countries receiving IAEA technical assistance and lacking suitable facilities.For routine purposes, the Unit plays a leading role in the development and transfer of nitrogen-15 assay technology used in IAEA technical assistance projects.
<P>
<B>Quality assurance service.</B> A recent initiative calls for establishing an international quality assurance service for nitrogen-15 analysis by optical emission spectrometry. The facilities of the Soil Science Unit will serve as the FAO/IAEA control  reference  laboratory. The service is expected to:
<UL>
<LI>ensure that the nitrogen-15 data generated by local laboratories are internationally acceptable;
<LI>give confidence and encouragement to counterparts in their analytical procedures;
<LI>promote regional cooperation and ensure an effective transfer of the nitrogen-15 technology to developing countries through FAO/IAEA programmes.
</UL>
<P>
The service marks another step forward in global efforts to effectively transfer nuclear and isotope related techniques for beneficial purposes. It will enable developing countries to further build their expertise in applying these powerful tools for sustainable agricultural development.

<h2>IAEA safeguards and the NPT: Examining interconnections</h2>
<i> An overview of the IAEA's verification role and its relationship to the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)</i>
<p>
<b>by Jan Priest</b>
<hr>
<P>
In April 1995, the States Party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT) will meet to review the Treaty's operation and decide upon its extension.
Quinquennial review conferences have been held ever since the NPT entered into force in 1970,
with a view to ensuring that the Treaty's purpose and provisions are being realized. 
However, in the light of the NPT's initial 25-year lifespan, the main focus of the 1995 conference
will be the Treaty's extension. Article X.2. of the NPT provides that, "Twenty five years after
the entry into force of the Treaty, a conference shall be convened to decide whether the Treaty
shall continue in force indefinitely, or shall be extended for an additional fixed period or periods.
This decision shall be taken by a majority of the Parties to the Treaty."
<p> 
The IAEA is neither the Secretariat of the NPT nor empowered to request States to adhere to it.
It does, however, have formal responsibility in the context of implementing Article III of the
Treaty. The IAEA's mandate, expertise, and experience also equip it well to assist in the
implementation of other Articles.
<p>
At the broadest level, the IAEA provides two service functions under the NPT. It facilitates and
provides a channel for endeavours aimed, in accordance with Article IV.2. of the Treaty, at ... "the
further development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, especially in the
territories of non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty, with due consideration for the needs
of the developing areas of the world."
<p> 
Its other major function is to administer international nuclear safeguards, in accordance with
Article III of the Treaty, to verify fulfillment of the non-proliferation commitment assumed by
non-nuclear-weapon States party to the Treaty,  "with a view to preventing diversion of nuclear
energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices."
<p> 
To put this dual function into historical perspective, it should be remembered that, since Fermi
demonstrated the atom's potential in 1942, the basic issue with which humanity has had to
grapple is how to exploit nuclear energy for human benefit while concurrently building,
maintaining, and developing a shield against nuclear weapons proliferation. The dual nature of
nuclear energy, reflected in the NPT, was also earlier very much in the minds of the drafters of
the IAEA Statute. Hence, the IAEA was created in 1957 with the twin objectives of promoting
the peaceful uses of nuclear energy while ensuring, so far as it is able,"that assistance provided
by it or at its request, or under its supervision or control is not used in such a way as to further
any military purpose." (IAEA Statute, Article II.)
<p>
In the latter connection, Article III.A.5 of the Statute authorizes the IAEA "to establish
and administer safeguards "in circumstances when the Agency itself is the source or channel of
assistance; when parties to any bilateral or multilateral arrangements request it to do so, or at the
request of a State to any of that State's activities in the field of atomic energy. Article XII sets
out the rights and responsibilities of the IAEA in such situations including the right to examine
the design of specialized equipment and facilities, including nuclear reactors to ensure, <i>inter
alia,</i> that the design will permit effective safeguards application; the right to require the
maintenance and production of operating records to assist in ensuring accountability for source
and special fissionable material, and the right to send inspectors into the recipient State, with
respect to any IAEA project or other arrangement where the Agency is requested by the Parties
to apply its safeguards.
<p>
This report examines the IAEA's relationship to Articles of the NPT which are
fundamental to the Treaty's non-proliferation, arms control, and disarmament provisions. As such,
it looks closely at the role and development of the IAEA's nuclear safeguards and
verification system.*
<h3>Safeguards and the NPT</h3>
If the IAEA Statute provides the basic <i>authority</i> for the application of safeguards and provides
a framework for such application, legal obligations to invoke safeguards are found elsewhere, i.e.
in instruments through which States make a legally binding commitment not to manufacture or
acquire nuclear weapons and to accept verification of their compliance with such undertakings.
The first such undertaking was made in a regional context through the 1967 Treaty for the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (The Treaty of Tlatelolco).
<p>
However, the entry into force of the NPT in 1970 was a watershed. Firstly, the Treaty was  
-- and remains -- the first global nuclear non-proliferation Treaty. Secondly, and stemming from
this, the Treaty assigns to the IAEA the responsibility for verifying, at the <i>global</i> level, through
its safeguards system, that non-nuclear weapon States fulfil their obligations not to use their
peaceful nuclear activities to develop any nuclear explosive devices of any kind. In the first years
of its existence, the IAEA's technical means of helping to further the non-proliferation objective --
its safeguards -- applied only to nuclear plants and fuel which countries obtained from
abroad, and then only if the supplier insisted on them. For the rest, the country concerned was
free either to make its own unsafeguarded plant or fuel and/or to buy them from less demanding
suppliers. 
<p>
The NPT's entry into force marked a new departure in that non-nuclear-weapon States
Party to the new, global instrument were -- and are -- obliged to conclude a full-scope  or
comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA. Under this type of agreement, safeguards
are applied to <i>all</i> source or special fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear
activities within the territory of the State, under its jurisdiction, or carried out under its control
anywhere. NPT safeguards have focused on nuclear material because, from the outset, efforts to
combat proliferation were based on the premise that the greatest challenge was the acquisition
of weapons-usable material, whether highly enriched uranium or plutonium.
<p>
Following the NPT's entry into force, the IAEA Board of Governors established a safeguards
committee to advise it on the contents of safeguards agreements to be concluded with non-nuclear
weapon States Party to the Treaty.  The committee developed a document entitled  The Structure
and Content of Agreements Between the Agency and States Required in Connection with the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons . The IAEA Board of Governors approved
this document in 1972, requesting the Director General to use it as a basis for negotiating
safeguards agreements under the NPT. The document was published by the IAEA as
INFCIRC/153 (Corrected). It has also served as a basis for the structure and content of other
comprehensive safeguards agreements. Additionally, while the five nuclear-weapon States Party
to the NPT are not obliged to conclude a safeguards agreement with the IAEA, each of them has
voluntarily accepted the application of IAEA safeguards to all or part of their peaceful nuclear
activities along the lines of INFCIRC/153 (Corrected).
<p>
<b>Rights and obligations. </b>The conclusion of an NPT safeguards agreement between a State and
the IAEA entails, sequentially, negotiation between the IAEA and the State on a draft text
(usually straightforward because NPT safeguards agreements follow the standard INFCIRC/153
model); the approval of the draft agreement by the IAEA Board of Governors; signature of the
text by the Agency's Director General and by the State's representative; and the registration of
the agreement, when it has entered into force, with the United Nations. Agreements set out the
Parties' basic rights and obligations relevant to the application of safeguards. These include the
State's basic non-proliferation undertaking to be verified through safeguards application; its
obligation to maintain a system of accounting and control for all nuclear material subject to
safeguards; and an obligation to provide the IAEA with all information relevant to the application
of safeguards. The agreements also include the IAEA's right and obligation to verify a State's
compliance with its basic undertaking and, in so doing, to avoid hampering a State's economic
and technological development. The IAEA is also required to protect such of the State's
commercial, industrial, and other confidential information that becomes known to it in the course
of safeguards implementation. 
<p>
Detailed safeguards implementation procedures are set out in the  subsidiary
arrangements  which are tailored specifically to the requirements of the facilities to be
safeguarded. These technical documents -- concluded between the IAEA and the State Party
simultaneously with, or subsequent to the conclusion of, a safeguards agreement -- are
treated as confidential and are normally accessible only to the IAEA and to the State
Party.
<h3>A basis for nuclear transparency</h3> 
NPT safeguards are a form of institutionalized nuclear transparency through which the IAEA can
provide assurance to the international community that a State's nuclear activities are being used
exclusively for peaceful purposes. Thus, through the assurance given, safeguards promote
confidence among States and help to strengthen their collective security. Safeguards are a
technical means of assuring a political end.
<p>
The technical objectives of NPT safeguards are that the IAEA be able to detect, in a timely
manner, a diversion of one significant quantity (SQ) of nuclear material from a State's peaceful
nuclear activities and to ensure that all nuclear material subject to safeguards in the State is
declared to the Agency. What constitutes a "significant quantity" is determined by the
approximate quantity of any given type of nuclear material which, taking into account any
conversion process involved, would be required for the manufacture of a nuclear explosive
device. The "timely detection" of diversion refers to the maximum timeframe (determined by the
"conversion time" required to convert different types of nuclear material into components of a
nuclear explosive device) within which the IAEA seeks to detect any diversion from peaceful use.
<p>
Safeguards -- with their main component parts of nuclear material accounting, containment and
surveillance measures (i.e. the application of cameras and seals), and on-site inspection -- are
essentially an audit system. In keeping with all modern audit practices, they can provide opinions
or conclusions but cannot certify  compliance or predict a State's future intentions.  Nor is the
IAEA safeguards inspectorate a kind of nuclear police force with enforcement powers.
<p>
Since the NPT entered into force in 1970, the IAEA has been able to provide a high level
of assurance of the non-diversion of nuclear material which has been placed under safeguards and
to identify cases where safeguards obligations are not being met. At previous NPT conferences,
it has been noted with satisfaction that, in carrying out its safeguards activities under the Treaty,
the IAEA has not detected any diversion of a significant amount of safeguarded nuclear material
from peaceful uses. NPT Parties have also affirmed their determination further to strengthen
barriers against nuclear weapons proliferation and have urged the IAEA to take full
advantage of its rights under safeguards agreements. 
<p>
All this notwithstanding, major developments have taken place since 1990. They have
highlighted the need to strengthen traditional approaches to NPT safeguards implementation;
changed the political expectations of the safeguards system; led to measures designed to meet
those new expectations; and have resulted in new kinds of verification functions for the
IAEA.
<h3>Responding to rising expectations</h3>
Iraq's violations of its comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA and of its NPT
obligations revealed with painful clarity that although the safeguards system remained effective
with regard to <i>declared</i> nuclear activities, it was not effectively equipped to detect <i>undeclared</i>
activities -- primarily because the system suffered from a shortage of information about any such
activities. With the discovery of Iraq's clandestine enrichment and nuclear weapons programmes,
it became very clear that, to work truly effectively, the safeguards system needed to be equipped
not only to verify <i>declared</i> nuclear activities in a credible manner but also, to the extent possible,
to provide assurance about the absence of <i>undeclared</i> activities: hence, the efforts that the IAEA
has since been making -- and continues to make -- to strengthen safeguards through new
measures focusing on access to information; to sites; and to the United Nations Security Council.
<p>
<b>Access to information.</b> The rationale underlying measures seeking to improve the IAEA's access
to information is that, the more that is known about a country's nuclear activities, the more
comprehensive the analysis and verification can be and the greater the degree of assurance that
can be provided about non-diversion and about the absence of undeclared activities. The starting
point is increased provision of information by the State itself supplemented by information that
the IAEA obtains during its verification activities and other information available to it from other
sources. For example, following the case of Iraq, information about the design of nuclear
facilities must now be forwarded to the IAEA much earlier than hitherto to enable the Agency
to have sufficient time in which to satisfy itself that such facilities are only for peaceful use and
also to facilitate safeguards implementation. Additionally, a reporting scheme has been initiated,
over and above the reporting requirements in NPT safeguards agreements, for exports and imports
of nuclear material and specified non-nuclear material and equipment. This is to enable the IAEA
to assess whether import and export patterns are consistent with other information available to
it about States' nuclear programmes. Efforts are also under way to strengthen and develop
the IAEA's information database by including within it <i>all</i> available information
whether derived from open source literature; obtained through the Agency's verification activities;
provided to the Agency by governments; or obtained elsewhere e.g. through commercial satellites.
Measures to enhance the IAEA's analytical capabilities are also being taken.
<p>
<b>Access to sites. </b>Under comprehensive safeguards agreements, inspector access to carry out
routine inspections is limited to "strategic points" in declared facilities, such points being those
to which access is necessary for the implementation of safeguards measures. The Iraq experience
showed that access limited in this way is insufficient to enable the detection of undeclared
activities. Therefore in February 1992, the IAEA Board of Governors affirmed the IAEA's right,
as provided for in safeguards agreements, to conduct "special inspections". In the course of these
inspections, the IAEA has the right to have access, in keeping with the terms of the relevant
safeguards agreement, to the additional information and locations it deems necessary for the
fulfillment of its obligations under that agreement. Improved access is also being sought through
encouraging States to make voluntary offers of access "any time, any place" to nuclear related
activities.
<p>
<b>Access to the UN Security Council. </b>Access to the United Nations Security Council is of
particular importance when access either to information, sites, or both is not forthcoming. Under
the IAEA Statute and in safeguards agreements, the Agency is obliged to report cases of
non-compliance with safeguards obligations to the Security Council. It is then for the Council
to decide what action to take. The cases of Iraq and of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) each elicited different responses from the Council. In terms of the IAEA's
responsibility for implementing NPT safeguards, however, the case of the DPRK serves to
illustrate the efficacy of some of the measures already taken, since Iraq, to strengthen the
safeguards system.
<p>
<b>Ongoing development of safeguards. </b>The process of strengthening, and otherwise improving
safeguards, was given further impetus by the report, submitted to the IAEA Director General in
April 1993 by the Standing Advisory Group on Safeguards Implementation (SAGSI), containing
recommendations for making safeguards more effective and more cost-efficient. Following
consideration of the report by the IAEA Board of Governors, "Programme 93+2" has been
established. Its goal is to present to the Board of Governors in March 1995, i.e. just prior to the
1995 NPT Conference, proposals for a more effective and efficient safeguards system with an
accompanying evaluation of the technical, legal, and financial implications. It is possible to view
the proposals now being developed in terms of clusters relating to the main areas of reform
already undertaken. Thus, they centre on additional measures to strengthen the IAEA's access
to information and to sites, and they also cover proposals for administrative streamlining. <i>(See
the article, "IAEA safeguards in the 1990s: Building from experience".)</i>
<p>
<b>Support from NPT Conferences.</b> It will be important for the 1995 NPT
Conference to support and endorse what the IAEA is seeking to achieve through its safeguards
strengthening measures. Previous NPT conferences have expressed or reaffirmed the conviction
that safeguards play a key role in preventing proliferation and have commended the IAEA for
the way in which safeguards implementation has been carried out in accordance with the
principles of the Treaty and the more detailed provisions of NPT safeguards agreements,
including the obligations upon the IAEA to respect the interests of the State.
<p>
The conferences have also welcomed the significant contributions made by States Party to the
Treaty in facilitating application of safeguards and have recognized the critical importance of
States continuing their political, technical, and financial support for the safeguards system. Such
continuing support will be vital. Safeguards practices, procedures, and implementation have
evolved progressively since the NPT entered into force. The post-Gulf War discoveries of
clandestine enrichment and nuclear weapons programmes in Iraq were a turning point. Providing
assurance through effective safeguards that <i>declared</I> nuclear material is not diverted will continue
to be the major part of safeguards work.
<p>
However, the efforts focusing on strengthening the IAEA's ability to detect the existence of
<i>undeclared</i> nuclear material and facilities are based on the realization that the safeguards system
as it used to be practiced is not enough today. The ultimate success of the collective endeavours
to strengthen safeguards will depend essentially upon the extent to which parties to the NPT are
prepared to grant the IAEA the necessary authority, co-operation, and resources.
<h3>Disarmament and related provisions</h3>
Articles VI and VII of the NPT are unlike its Article III in that neither of them invest the IAEA
with <i>specific</i> responsibility for their implementation. Indeed, in this respect the onus under Article
VI falls squarely upon the States Parties.
<p>
Under Article VI of the Treaty, "Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue
negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at
an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament
under strict and effective international control."
<p> 
Article VII of the Treaty does not impose any obligation upon States but notes that, looking
towards the cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament foreshadowed in Article
VI, "Nothing in this Treaty affects the right of any group of States to conclude regional treaties
in order to assure the total absence of nuclear weapons in their respective territories." 
<p>
It is generally recognized that responsibility for implementing Article VI of the NPT falls largely
to its Parties that are nuclear-weapon States. They have been criticized at previous NPT
conferences for insufficient efforts, either quantitavely or qualitatively, to stem what is generally
called "vertical" proliferation.
<p>
However, there is no doubt that substantial progress has been made towards achieving the goals
of Article VI since the end of the Cold War. In the present global detente, the major military
powers are helping to settle regional conflicts rather than competing in them. Substantial cuts
have been made in nuclear arsenals and others -- particularly under the START II Treaty -- are
in prospect. Initiatives have also been taken, and others may follow, to submit to IAEA
safeguards nuclear weapons material which is deemed to be excess to defense requirements. In
1993 the UN General Assembly adopted, without a vote, a resolution calling for the negotiation
of a "cut-off" agreement which would ban the production of fissionable material for weapons
purposes.
<p>
The nuclear-weapon States Party to the NPT could make what might be a critical contribution
to the prospects of NPT extension by agreeing on, or being party to substantial progress towards,
a comprehensive nuclear test ban and/or on a cut-off of the production of fissionable material for
weapons purposes. Success in each regard does not depend solely on NPT parties that are
nuclear-weapon States because other States -- some of which have not acceded to the NPT  
-- are also involved. However, to the extent that nuclear weapons States continue to emphasize the
importance of nuclear assets to national security, it is not unreasonable to deduce that the
thinking of others could be coloured similarly in the same way that progress towards nuclear
disarmament can reinforce commitment to non-proliferation.
<p>
<b>Comprehensive test ban.</b> The measure which most NPT parties have put at the top of the arms
control agenda for decades -- especially at NPT Review Conferences -- is a Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT), which is now being negotiated at the Conference on Disarmament in
Geneva. The choice of organization to verify compliance with an eventual CTBT will be a matter
for the parties to that Treaty. However, the IAEA has a broad base of experience with and
expertise in many of the administrative and technical issues arising in the context of a CTBT.
Moreover, there is a good deal of overlap between the NPT and a CTBT. Non-nuclear-weapon
States party to the NPT are already <i>de facto</i> parties to a CTBT in that they are prohibited from
testing any nuclear explosive devices. Such devices cannot be manufactured without fissionable
material. IAEA safeguards are applied to all source or fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear
activities in a non-nuclear-weapon States party to the Treaty, and should thus be able to detect
any diversion of material for the purposes of testing. Violations of a CTBT -- as with violations
of safeguards obligations -- are likely to involve recourse to the United Nations Security
Council.
<p>
<b>Cut-off agreement. </b>A cut-off in the production of fissionable material for weapons
purposes does not in itself seem to be unrealistic. There is already concern about how to
deal with the surplus direct-use material which will result from the nuclear disarmament
accords already negotiated. A cut-off is also relevant to Article VI of the NPT. 
Currently, there is no agreement on an appropriate negotiating mandate for a cut-off. If
agreement is reached in the future, however, verification of a cut-off would be consistent
with the IAEA's mandate and with its NPT safeguards responsibilities in NPT
non-nuclear-weapon States. Additionally, a non-discriminatory cut-off agreement of the kind
foreshadowed by the 1993 UN General Assembly resolution would most logically include
placing under effective international verification, all enrichment and reprocessing plants in
NPT nuclear-weapon States  and those in the "threshold States" which are <i>not</i> party to the
Treaty. Taking all these factors into account, it is difficult to see any verification
option <i>other</i> than through IAEA safeguards; a different solution would entail for
some new or alternative mechanism -- a major and very costly assignment, not least
because verification at enrichment and reprocessing plants is extremely labour
intensive.<i> (See related article on the cut-off agreement entitled, 
"US fissile materials: Implications for the IAEA".)</i>
<p>
Under the nuclear disarmament accords already negotiated or in prospect, verification of
the actual dismantling of nuclear weapons will have to fall to the military/industrial sectors. 
However, IAEA safeguards -- and perhaps, special additional controls administered by the
IAEA -- can be used to verify the peaceful use or storage of fissionable material derived
from such dismantling. Indeed, the United States has already unilaterally submitted some
of its direct-use material, deemed excess to its defense requirements, to IAEA safeguards
under its "voluntary offer" safeguards agreement pursuant to the NPT. Such measures  
-- and others devised for the same purpose --  are also consistent with Article VI of the NPT.
Through them, the IAEA can provide credible assurance to the international community
that the material in question does not find its way into new weapons.
<p>
<b>Regional non-proliferation arrangements.</b> Article VII of the NPT reflects the significance of
regional non-proliferation arrangements as a means through which confidence in and between
States of a specific region can be established and nurtured, thereby complementing the global
arrangements enshrined in the NPT itself.
<p>
The Treaty-based nuclear-weapon free zones (NWFZs) already established or in prospect provide
for verification arrangements closely linked with safeguards implementation pursuant to the NPT.
For example, the safeguards agreements which States Parties to the Rarotonga Treaty (in the
South Pacific) must conclude with the IAEA "shall be, or shall be equivalent in its scope and
effect to, an agreement required in connection with the NPT on the basis of the materials
reproduced in document INFCIRC/153(Corr.) of the IAEA". Moreover, most safeguards
agreements between the IAEA and the States party to the Treaty of Tlatelolco (in Latin America
and the Caribbean) have been concluded in connection both with the Tlatelolco Treaty and the
NPT. Parties to future NWFZs will no doubt also develop specific verification scenarios based
on their own regional requirements.
<p>
As more States become parties to different non-proliferation initiatives, the
complementarity between regional nuclear verification arrangements and the global system which
the IAEA implements could open up further possibilities for effective and cost-efficient
verification of compliance with non-proliferation undertakings. In this respect, a binding
commitment by the relevant States to keep Africa nuclear-weapon-free is now a realistic prospect,
and a draft Treaty, now being negotiated, assigns to the IAEA the responsibility for verifying
compliance. In the Middle East, the creation of an NWFZ is likely to come about only in the
context of an overall peace settlement. However, there is already agreement among Middle East
States about the potential value of such a zone in their region. There is also recognition of the
ability of the IAEA to provide effective verification. Because of the particular characteristics of
the political situation in the Middle East, however, arrangements for verification of compliance
with a future NWFZ there are likely to be more far-reaching than those generally carried out by
the IAEA. Parties to a future Middle East NWFZ might therefore consider it necessary to put
additional, more intrusive verification arrangements in place.
<h3>An evolutionary process</h3>
In sum, global efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and to reduce existing
stockpiles of such weapons, have evolved progressively over the past 25 years in the light of
specific political and technological developments. Key factors, during the 1990s, have been the
end of the Cold War with all the accompanying geo-political obligations. Thus, the 1990s have
highlighted the need for appropriate responses to new challenges and for more effective nuclear
verification.
<p>
Response mechanisms include efforts to more fully utilize, and where appropriate
strengthen, the safeguards capabilities of the IAEA, which has specific verification responsibilities
under the NPT and which may be called upon to exercise new functions in years to come.
Important steps have already been taken to strengthen IAEA safeguards, but much remains to be
done. The success of these efforts ultimately will depend on the extent to which States, especially
those Party to the NPT, are prepared to grant the IAEA the requisite authority,
co-operation, and resources to help them meet the challenges ahead.

<H2>IAEA technical co-operation: Strengthening technology transfer</H2>
<I>New strategies and approaches have been initiated to more effectively  support and assist
countries in safely applying nuclear technologies</I>
<P>
<B>by Paulo M. Barretto</B>
<HR>
While the transfer of nuclear technology takes place through various bilateral and multilateral channels, the IAEA has long served as the key international mechanism for scientific and technical co-operation in the nuclear field. Worldwide, more than 80 countries today receive IAEA-supported technical assistance, and altogether more than 1200 projects are in the IAEA's 1995 technical co-operation programme.
<P>
The underlying basis for the IAEA's work to facilitate the peaceful development of nuclear energy is its Statute, which entered into force in 1957 and sets the framework for activities. 
<P>
When the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) came into force in 1970 -- more than a decade after the IAEA's creation --  its provisions reflected these aims.  Specifically, Article IV of the NPT states inter alia that "All the Parties to the Treaty undertake to facilitate, and have the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  Parties to the Treaty in a position to do so shall also co-operate in contributing alone or together with other States or international organizations to the further development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, especially in the territories of non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty, with due consideration for the needs of the developing areas of the world."
<P> 
As they have at past NPT Review Conferences, parties to the Treaty are expected to closely
consider the IAEA's technical co-operation activities when they meet in April 1995 to decide on
the NPT's extension. This article provides an overview of the IAEA's programmes for assisting
the transfer of peaceful nuclear technologies. It particularly addresses the programme's
organization, scope, funding, and policy directions.
<P>
<H3>IAEA mechanisms for technology transfer</H3>
Within the IAEA, the Department of Technical Co-operation and two technical departments  
the Department of Research and Isotopes and the Department of Nuclear Energy and Safety  
are the main channels for technology transfer activities. Financing of activities undertaken by
these two technical departments is through the IAEA's regular budget. Technical assistance
provided by the Department of Technical Co-operation is funded largely from extrabudgetary
resources, namely voluntary contributions by IAEA Member States.
<P>
<B>Technology transfer through technical departments</B>.  A range of technology-transfer activities
are carried out by technical departments. They include those within the framework of the:
<UL>
<LI><B><I>International Nuclear Information System</I> (INIS)</B>. This system continues to be one of the
IAEA's principal channels for disseminating scientific and technical information. It covers
virtually every aspect of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, incorporating a database of some
1.8 million records. Participation today extends to 65 developing and 23 industrialized countries,
as well as 17 international organizations.
<LI><B><I>Meetings and publications</I></B>. The IAEA holds some 400 meetings on various topics in nuclear
science and technology each year, including 10-14 major conferences, symposia, and seminars.
In 1994, the meetings attracted nearly 2500 participants. Many meetings, projects, and
programmes of the technical departments result in publications and technical documents that are
widely distributed within IAEA Member States.
<LI><B><I>Research centres and laboratories</I></B>. Alone among other international organizations, the IAEA
operates its own research and service laboratories, which contribute significantly to the transfer
of nuclear technologies. The IAEA's Seibersdorf Laboratories, near Vienna, provide a diverse
range of technical services for programmes in physics, chemistry, hydrology, nuclear
instrumentation, and agriculture. The IAEA's Marine Environment Laboratory in Monaco carries
out studies of pollution and radioactivity in the oceans, lakes, and other water bodies. It
frequently collaborates with oceanographic institutes worldwide and undertakes projects in
co-operation with other international environmental programmes and institutions combining
nuclear and non-nuclear techniques. The International Centre for Theoretical Physics, in Trieste,
Italy, is financed jointly by Italy, UNESCO, and the IAEA. It serves as an important mechanism
for the exchange and transfer of advanced scientific knowledge and skills.
<LI><B><I> Research contracts</I></B>. Research work supported by the IAEA is being carried out
under 1950 research contracts and agreements in more than 90 developing and industrialized
countries. Most contracts and agreements are components of Co-ordinated Research Programmes
(CRPs) through which groups of scientists in various countries co-operatively investigate
problems and their solutions in a range of fields. Over the past 10 years, the IAEA has directly
financed research activities amounting to nearly US $43 million.
</UL>
<B>Technology transfer through technical co-operation projects</B>. For 1995, the IAEA's technical
co-operation programme --  the major channel of technology transfer --  includes more than 1200
projects in more than 80 developing countries. These projects --  either at the national, regional,
or interregional level --  cover a wide range of scientific and technical work related to nuclear
power; the nuclear fuel cycle; radioactive waste management; food and agriculture; human health;
industry and earth sciences; physical and chemical sciences; radiation protection; safety of nuclear
installations; and programme direction and support.
<UL>
<LI><B><I>Conditions and controls</I></B>. In view of the technical co-operation programme's scope, size, and
nature, specific conditions and controls have been established for the implementation of projects.
Within the framework established by the IAEA Statute, the delivery of technical assistance is
regulated by two documents, including an agreement known by the acronym RSA, that contain,
inter alia, provisions to ensure the exclusively peaceful use of technical assistance provided
through the IAEA's technical co-operation programme, as well as the requirement that the
IAEA's Safety Standards and measures be applied to such assistance. Almost all IAEA Members
States receiving technical assistance have concluded an RSA. After the breakup of the former
Soviet Union and developments in Central and Eastern Europe, a number of newly independent
States joined the IAEA during 1992-94. Although these countries had not yet signed the RSA,
the IAEA responded immediately to requests for technical assistance in order to address some
of the most pressing problems.
<LI><B><I>Types of assistance</I></B>.  Assistance is provided mainly through three components that support the
establishment or upgrading of nuclear techniques and facilities: experts, equipment, and training,
which includes fellowships, scientific visits, and training courses. A particularly important area
is the provision of support to set up or improve regulatory practices and radiation safety
infrastructures as a prerequisite for assistance in certain fields of activity.
Since 1970 --  when the NPT came into force --   more than 17,000 scientists and specialists from
developing countries have been awarded fellowships or scientific visits and more than 18,600
participants have attended training courses. Nearly 30,000 experts have been assigned to assist
nuclear-related development in countries worldwide. Project equipment and materials valued at
more than US $290 million have been delivered over this time period.
<LI><B><I>Funding and resources</I></B>. While the costs of administration and related support for technical
co-operation projects is fully borne by the IAEA regular budget, the technical assistance actually
provided to countries comes from voluntary contributions that States directly make through the
IAEA or the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). About 75% of total resources
in recent years has come from the IAEA's Technical Assistance and Co-operation Fund (TACF),
whose annual target is set by the IAEA's governing bodies. Since 1971, the target has been
increasing, reaching US $58.5 million in 1994. While all IAEA Member States are encouraged
to share in the fund's financing, not all of them do so. Other sources of financial support include
extrabudgetary income, which donor States contribute for specific projects; assistance-in-kind,
whereby States provide expert services, donate equipment, or arrange fellowships on a cost-free
basis; and UNDP funds, for those UNDP projects involving nuclear science and technology.
Since 1970, total new resources available to the IAEA's technical co-operation programme have
grown from about US $4 million in 1970 to more than $53 million in 1994.
<LI><B><I>Technical co-operation and NPT membership</I></B>. In the preparation of the technical co-operation
programme, the IAEA does not differentiate between States on the basis of their NPT status. 
Projects are assessed exclusively in terms of technical and practical feasibility, national
development priorities, and long-term advantages to end users.
<P>
In practice, the proportion of disbursements from the TACF to non-NPT States has remained
relatively constant over the years, fluctuating between 16% and 20%. The distribution of the
IAEA's Research Contracts evidences similar trends. The situation for sound projects that require
additional funding outside the TACF (known as  footnote a  projects) is quite different. In this
case, donor countries have shown a clear preference for financing projects in countries that are
parties to the NPT. For non-NPT countries, the proportion of such disbursements fluctuates
between 2% and 5%.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Trends and challenges</H3>
In terms of overall economic development, and particularly concerning the stage of nuclear
development, there are significant differences among developing countries. Seventeen of the 32
States operating or constructing nuclear power plants are developing countries. Some of them also
possess nuclear fuel cycle technology and facilities, including such sophisticated techniques as
uranium enrichment, reactor fuel fabrication, spent fuel reprocessing, and heavy water production.
Some of these countries are already exporting certain nuclear technologies and materials and are
providing bilateral assistance to other States in research, development, and application of nuclear
technologies. 
<P>
Concerning other applications, 38 developing countries operate 85 research reactors of various
types and capacities. Nuclear scientific and technological infrastructures have been formed around
these facilities, enabling these countries to conduct basic and applied research and development,
radioisotope and radiopharmaceutical production, and other research-related activities. Most
developing countries have gained experience in the application of isotopes and radiation in many
fields, including agriculture, medicine, industry, and hydrology, and many may be relatively
advanced in them. At the same time, there are  States, particularly among the least developed
countries, where nuclear activities consist mainly in the introduction of limited nuclear techniques
and related training. 
<P>
In terms of supplying technical assistance to such a diverse range of countries, one noticeable
trend is that end users are being more clearly defined and targeted. Whereas techniques once
were transferred to specialist groups working at research establishments of national atomic energy
commissions, the training and equipment for specific technologies today are increasingly being
delivered more directly. For example, hospital staff are the end users of nuclear medical
diagnostic techniques, and professionals at water management institutions are the end users for
applications of isotopes in hydrology. 
<P>
Another trend is the increasing contribution of developing countries to regional IAEA technical
co-operation activities, both as hosts for training courses and as providers of experts. Three
regional co-operative agreements now are in place, for Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia
and the Pacific.  Regional membership has grown steadily and today 54 IAEA Member States
are participating in these agreements. More than 30 multi-year regional projects are in operation,
and about 40 regional training activities are carried out each year.
<P>
A third trend is the growing share of technical co-operation funds for projects in areas of
radioactive waste management, radiation protection, and safety of nuclear installations. This
reflects the needs and interests of many developing countries. The radiation safety situation, for
example, still needs improvement in many developing countries. In more than a third of the
IAEA's Member States, the existing control mechanisms for radiation safety are deemed
inadequate. A few countries have yet to establish the appropriate infrastructure. In light of the
situation, and the continuing rapid growth in the application of nuclear techniques, the IAEA has
initiated steps to strengthen its assistance in areas of radiation safety. In its planning over the
medium term, the IAEA further has given high priority to areas of nuclear safety, radiation
protection, and waste management.
<P>
Fourth, the IAEA is seeing increasing requests for technical assistance of an advanced and more
complex nature. In some measure, this development reflects the effectiveness of past support.
Many developing countries that have received IAEA technical assistance have reached high levels
of sophistication in the application of nuclear techniques. They now are seeking support for larger
projects   for example, the establishment of a radioisotope production facility, research reactor
and/or cyclotron, the treatment and storage of radioactive wastes, or the eradication of agricultural
pests. Such projects will require long-term commitments and, in many cases, complementary
bilateral co-operation.
<P>
Also worth noting in this connection is the different types of problems countries are facing,
particularly newly independent States of the former Soviet Union. Many of these countries, for
example, face major problems arising from previous programmes in nuclear power and
nuclear-related applications. Technical assistance is needed to replace defunct infrastructures,
establish regulatory bodies, train personnel, and support implementation of remedial measures to
upgrade nuclear facilities to modern operational and safety standards while bringing
environmental problems under control. As a basis for these activities, the countries need to
establish internationally proven regulatory practices, and they need to prepare for
decommissioning of some nuclear facilities. Several initiatives have been undertaken by
international organizations including the IAEA to address these problems, but more needs to be
accomplished.
<p>
<H3>Strengthening transfer of technology</H3>
Since most of the IAEA's Member States also are parties to the NPT, they understandably share
some common interests and requirements that are specifically reflected in the IAEA's
medium-term plans and biennial programmes. These plans and programmes take into account
present and expected developments in the peaceful uses of atomic energy.
<P>
One important development is the world's growing population, which in turn will influence
demands for more energy, particularly electricity. As there is no global intergovernmental energy
organization, the IAEA will stimulate and, where necessary, co-ordinate international efforts
required to assess the benefits and problems of various power options, including nuclear energy.
 <p>
When considering the IAEA's role in contributing to the transfer of nuclear power and related
activities, it should be recognized that the nuclear industry has made great progress in
commercializing many technologies and that new suppliers have appeared on the market, some
of them developing countries. The IAEA's future role should be to find more ways of supporting
and assisting buyers and to remove obstacles to free choice. The IAEA's traditional function of
providing a forum for information exchange in this area also may expand if demand for nuclear
power increases and if this increase is followed by expanded development programmes in the
field of power reactor technology and design. Additionally, the IAEA should be ready to respond
to requests for assistance from developing countries that are considering the nuclear option,
particularly concerning the training and development of the necessary human resources.
<p>
The world's people, most of whom live in developing countries, also need greatly increased
supplies of food and fresh water, better health care, and greater access to industrial goods.
Nuclear methods that can lead to improvements in the production and preservation of food, in
health care, in industrial production, and in the provision of water supplies are increasing in
number. They are often competitive with other methods   indeed in some cases they are the
only methods available. The scope for the exchange of experience in using nuclear methods and
in transferring them to developing countries is therefore expanding. Non-power applications of
nuclear energy will remain the area of technology transfer of greatest interest for most 
developing countries. 
<P>
The IAEA's task in the medium term will almost invariably be to create or strengthen capabilities
at the national level, primarily through its technical co-operation programme. Achieving this goal
will require greater precision in identifying those areas where assistance will have the most
impact. Special emphasis is being placed on projects that are in line with national development
plans, are of a practical nature, are oriented towards specific end users, and are intended to have
a significant impact on the country's overall development. Projects that combine all of these
features have been identified as  model projects  and are intended to serve as beacons for the
direction in which the IAEA's technical co-operation programme is moving.
On the basis of its assessments, the IAEA has formulated a number of overall objectives for its
activities over the medium term. One objective is to enhance the transfer of nuclear technology
and know-how to developing countries, and more specifically to:
<UL>
<LI>ensure, through increased interaction with responsible governmental authorities, that the Agency's
technology-transfer activities are in line with national development plans. The aim of IAEA
assistance will be to strengthen the relevant national infrastructures so that they become
self-supporting. Development of human resources, quality control services, and maintenance of
nuclear instrumentation will receive more attention under this strategy;
<LI>help establish and strengthen national nuclear safety, radiation protection, and waste management
systems as a prerequisite for the development of nuclear energy programmes, mainly through the
provision of training and advice;
<LI>give priority to provision of assistance in the transfer of technology to areas involving basic
human needs, such as food and water resources, health, and energy supply, and to the transfer
of techniques contributing to environmental protection and sustainable development;
promote only those nuclear techniques in developing countries which have a clear advantage over
other techniques, and to this end,  compare nuclear and non-nuclear techniques, taking into
account the conditions prevailing in the recipient countries;
<LI>co-operate with relevant international organizations in establishing appropriate databases and
systematically analyzing the economic, health, environmental, and climatic impacts of various
energy options; in particular to contribute analyses and data concerning nuclear power to such
studies and to make the results of this work widely available to experts in IAEA Member States;
<LI>promote the exchange of information and international discussions with interested
Member States, and such parties as the World Association of Nuclear Operators and international
financial institutions, with the aim of developing new schemes for financing, constructing, and
operating nuclear power plants in developing countries;
<LI> perform global analyses and strategic studies of selected aspects of nuclear power
and the fuel cycle, including assurance of supply.
</UL>
Another objective is to assist countries in achieving and maintaining a high level of nuclear
safety worldwide and minimizing the environmental impact of all types of peaceful nuclear
activities and applications. More specifically, this entails activities to:
<UL>
<LI> provide international leadership and assistance to national nuclear safety
authorities, especially to governmental nuclear regulatory bodies, with a view to detecting and
correcting safety deficiencies in operating nuclear facilities and to preventing accidents.
<LI> support the efforts of international and national bodies in reaching a consensus on
safety principles for the design of future nuclear power plants;
<LI> take the lead in developing an international technical consensus on the acceptability
of methods for the management and disposal of nuclear waste of all kinds, and to help gain
public confidence in these matters;
<LI>provide expanded international guidance and assistance to national nuclear safety
authorities to ensure the safety of research reactors, spent fuel management facilities, and
installations using radiation sources, with special attention to large research reactors and
irradiation facilities;
<LI> establish a harmonized international approach to all aspects of nuclear safety,
including the incorporation of recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological
Protection into the IAEA's standards and guides.
</UL>
<p>
<h3>Financing the needs</h3>
What does this changing pattern and redirection of technical co-operation activities mean in terms
of funding? Surprisingly, the additional resources required are remarkably small in relation to the
importance and magnitude of the tasks ahead. Most of the resources could be obtained from fuller
contributions to the IAEA's Technical Assistance and Co-operation Fund. 
<P>
Over the past 5 years, available funds for the IAEA's technical co-operation programme, in terms
of delivery of services, have fluctuated around a rather constant value of about US $40 million
per year. At the same time, however, there has been a negative trend since 1984 in the receipt
of financial resources, both with respect to pledged contributions and the actual income received
to meet the target amount for the TACF. Pledges and payments started to decline after 1984,
reaching a level of 71.3% of the targeted amount in 1992. The drop in total income was even
more marked with a low of 65.1% of the target being registered in 1992. <I>(See graph.)</I> This trend
has affected the past delivery of services. In fact, over the 1987-94 period, between 6% and 20%
of the approved IAEA technical co-operation programme could not be funded or implemented.
<P>
If projected into the IAEA's next programme cycle for 1995-96, the present gap between the
TACF target and actual income would amount to about US $13-20 million per year.
Consequently, if the pledges and payments were made according to their designated shares and
targeted amount, most of the IAEA's approved technical co-operation programme for the 1995-96
period could be funded. 
<H3>Bridging technological gaps</H3>
As this overview shows, the IAEA undertakes a multitude of activities in line with Article IV of
the NPT that have substantially contributed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in developing
countries. In fact, for most of these countries, IAEA-supported projects have provided the key
inputs for building the national infrastructures required for the introduction of nuclear techniques
in the areas of basic human needs, ranging from food production and water supplies to public
health and safety.
<P>
Over the course of the years, basic policies and mechanisms for the transfer of nuclear
technology to developing countries have evolved enabling the IAEA to efficiently provide various
types of support. In particular, it is worth noting that the transfer of technology and techniques
has always ranked highly among the main objectives of the IAEA, which also include the
establishment of health and safety standards, and the development and implementation of
safeguards. They further extend to such matters as, for example, the establishment of guidelines
and an international convention relating to the physical protection of nuclear materials. As a
result, there has been a growth of resources and an extensive involvement of the IAEA's overall
efforts in technology-transfer activities, both under the technical co-operation programme and
through activities of IAEA technical departments.
<P>
Moreover, the IAEA has a well-established mechanism for considering policy matters, assurances
against nuclear proliferation, and safety and operational issues related to technical co-operation.
This process involves the participation of the IAEA's policy-making organs and a number of
advisory and technical committees and groups. By these means, the IAEA can identify, generally
in good time, the modifications and technical adjustments necessary to maintain the efficiency
and quality of its assistance.
<p>
At the same time, it is recognized that there is plenty of scope for improvement of
technology-transfer activities that contribute to bridging the technological gap between
industrialized and developing countries. In view of its structure, experience, and control
mechanisms against nuclear proliferation, the IAEA provides a unique opportunity for all NPT
parties --  and in particular for the most technologically advanced of these States --  to contribute
to the further development and utilization of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, as envisaged
under Article IV of the NPT.

<H2>Atoms for peace: Extending the benefits of nuclear technologies</H2>
<I>
Through IAEA-supported projects, beneficial nuclear technologies are contributing to national development goals
</I>
<P>
<B>by Jihui Qian and Alexander Rogov</B>
<HR>
<I>
Over the past 40 years, a disease known as rinderpest, or "cattle plague", has been devastating for farmers in Africa, claiming the lives of millions of cattle and severely hurting farm production and income.  Especially in the 1980s, serious outbreaks of rinderpest in livestock were reported throughout Africa.
<P>
Today, that picture has changed.  Out of 18 African countries where cattle once were infested with rinderpest, only two show signs of the disease today.  Instrumental to this remarkable turnabout has been a Pan-African campaign that incorporated the application of a new nuclear-based testing technique developed jointly by the IAEA, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, and a laboratory in the United Kingdom in 1987.  The application has radically increased the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns against cattle plague, enabling African countries  to declare themselves free of the disease.  Veterinarians in these countries received support from the IAEA's technical co-operation programme and an FAO/IAEA coordinated research programme.  They were supplied with necessary testing kits, equipment, training, and technical support to ensure the correct use of the technique in national veterinary laboratories.  Participating laboratories throughout Africa now have acquired the expertise and skills they need to carry out effective testing.
<P>
The project's success is leading to similar work in other regions of the world.  A global rinderpest campaign has been launched with the aim of eradicating the disease over the next 20 years.  Under a 4-year IAEA technical co-operation project, the techniques developed through the FAO/IAEA's work in Africa will be part of efforts for rinderpest surveillance and control in West Asia.  Countries there currently are suffering millions of dollars in losses from animal deaths. The IAEA regional project aims to help these countries eradicate rinderpest by the turn of the century.
</I>
<P>
The case of rinderpest is just one example of how international and national scientists are working together to bring practical benefits to people through technology-transfer projects supported by the IAEA.  In other fields as well including medicine, environmental protection, and food preservation, for example - nearly, 1300 IAEA-supported projects are making key contributions around the world.  This article looks at the kinds of projects cooperatively undertaken through IAEA mechanisms to extend the reach of beneficial nuclear technologies in response in increasing demands for technical support and assistance from its Member States.
<P>
<H3>Evolution of international nuclear co-operation</H3>
<P>
In the early 1950s, the international community was first becoming aware of the great opportunities that peaceful applications of atomic energy could offer for economic and social development.  It was also becoming apparent that, for most countries, these opportunities could be materialized in a most effective manner through extensive and concerted international efforts.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/qian1.gif ALT="">
</CENTER>
<P>
In this environment, on 4 December 1954, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously passed an "Atoms for Peace" resolution expressing the hope that an international atomic energy agency would be established without delay to facilitate the use by the entire world of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, and to encourage international co-operation in the further development and practical use of atomic energy for the benefit of humanity.
<P>
At the time when the IAEA was established in 1957, only a limited number of countries had knowledge and experience in nuclear research, and especially its practical application. At the first International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, held in Geneva in August 1955 and attended by scientists and engineers from 73 countries, less than half of participating States were able to present reports on nuclear science or technology and only 12 of these States were from developing areas of the world.
<P>
In framing the IAEA's Statute, governments sought to create an international institution through which countries could receive multilateral technical assistance on peaceful nuclear research and applications.  The Statute stipulates a range of conditions for countries to receive such assistance.  These include, <I>inter alia</I>, the usefulness of the project, including its scientific and technical feasibility; the adequacy of plans, funds, and technical personnel to assure the effective execution of the project; and the adequacy of proposed health and safety standards for handling and storing materials and for operating facilities.
<P> 
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/qian2.gif ALT="">
</CENTER>
<P>
Back in 1957, however, the basis for technical assistance activities was fairly weak.  The sphere of co-operation was relatively limited covering mainly nuclear power and aspects of its fuel cycle, and to a certain extent some aspects of radiation applications.  Very few peaceful nuclear technologies had reached the level of maturity which enabled them to be effectively used for practical applications.  At that time as well, most developing countries were not yet at the stage where they could effectively apply nuclear science and technology.  It should also be noted that, in the early years, none of the three partners involved in the technical assistance process i.e. donor countries, recipient countries, and the IAEA - had neither the required experience nor administrative arrangements for multilateral intergovernmental co-operation.
<P>
Today, the situation is different.  Most IAEA Member States from the developing world have gained knowledge and experience in many fields of nuclear research and applications, mainly those related to basic human needs.  Mechanisms for technology transfer have been put into place, and their effectiveness is continually reviewed.  IAEA activities cover practically all areas of peaceful applications of nuclear energy, and interest in receiving technical assistance is growing.

<P>
<H3>Priorities and needs</H3>
<P>
What kinds of technical assistance are countries receiving?  In terms of total annual disbursements through the IAEA's technical co-operation programme, the largest share is for projects related to nuclear applications in food and agriculture, which accounted for about 22% of disbursements in 1994.  Nuclear-related methods are widely used in developing countries in such areas as plant breeding, soil fertility studies, insect and pest control, animal production and health, and studies of the fertilizer efficiency and the fate of agrochemicals and residues. The technology of food irradiation additionally is finding increasing acceptance as an effective means of protecting agriculture products from spoilage, and as a method for controlling pathogens associated with serious food-borne diseases and for meeting the strict quarantine requirements of international food trade.
<P>
Another major area of interest is the use of nuclear technologies in physical and chemical sciences, and in fields of industry and earth science.  This includes the utilization of research reactors and particle accelerators for scientific studies, production of isotopes; the application, maintenance and repair of nuclear instrumentation; and the preparation and utilization of radiopharmaceuticals.  Over the 1990-94 period, the share of total disbursements in this area have ranged between 18% and 25%.  Other areas showing high levels of interest are nuclear applications in industry and earth sciences - including non-destructive testing of materials and products, radiation processing, and development of water resources, for example and nuclear-related health care and treatment.  Greater support, for instance, is being requested in the use of nuclear techniques for the diagnosis of many diseases, such as leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, iodine deficiencies, and sickle cell diseases.  At the same time, the use of ionizing radiation to treat cancer is drawing more and more interest.  Currently the IAEA has 40 technical co-operation projects associated with radiotherapy in 29 countries.  Additionally, nuclear methods and technologies are used for sterilization of biological tissues and medical supplies, and for nutritional and health-related environmental studies.
<P>
An area of shifting demand is nuclear power and safety.  While nuclear power programmes in many countries have been cut back or halted, there is increasing awareness of the needs for nuclear safety and radiation protection.  The share of disbursements on nuclear power has dropped from about 12% in the late 1980s to 6% in the 1990s, whereas the share for safety and radiation protection has grown.  Projects being supported include those related to strengthening national infrastructures for radiation protection; occupational safety of radiation workers; safety of nuclear installations; the safe management, storage, and disposal of radioactive wastes; and nuclear emergency planning and preparedness.
<P>
On average over the past 5 years, countries have received technical assistance from the IAEA valued at about US $40 million per year through expert services, provision of equipment, and training activities.  All told over the past 25 years, the cumulative resources available to the IAEA's technical co-operation programme amount to nearly US $690 million.
<P>
<H3>Realizing the benefits</H3>
As the rinderpest example illustrates, a number of techniques developed and applied with the IAEA's assistance are significantly contributing to the solution of serious problems hampering social and economic development.  Some selected other cases may help to indicate the number of different ways in which the IAEA's assistance can be applied.
<P>
<B>Water resources.</B> The assessment and development of water resources has been a major area of IAEA activity for more than 30 years.  Nuclear and isotope techniques play a valuable role in hydrological investigations.  Under one current project, in Venezuela, IAEA scientists are helping local water authorities in Caracas study the potential of an aquifer to provide additional water for residential, agricultural, and industrial needs.  A rapid increase in the population of Caracas has led to a deficit of nearly 20% in the water supply, and more water resources must be found.  Studies will help Venezuelan authorities make decisions concerning the best use of the aquifer, and how to protect its water from pollution.
<P>
<B>Animal health and productivity.</B>  Buffaloes and cattle in Asia are fed mainly with rice straw and native grasses.  However, these materials are very indigestible and have only limited amounts of the protein, energy, and minerals needed to provide a balanced diet. Poor nutrition seriously compromises the ability of the animals to produce meat and milk and to provide draught power.  Through projects jointly supported by the IAEA and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), assistance was provided to India and Indonesia in using isotopes for investigating the efficiency of the processes involved in feed digestion.  As a result, the best combination of local materials for supplementing grass or straw was determined.
<P>
In both countries the effect of the introduction of this feed supplementation method has been very high.  For example, in India the amount of milk collected by the largest milk co-operative in 1989 increased by 30%, and the price was 25% less than the price of producing milk by the other methods of feed supplementation.
<P>
<B>Quality control in industry.</B>  Non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques are widely applied in industry and manufacturing for quality control purposes.  In Latin America and the Caribbean, an IAEA-supported NDT regional project involving 18 countries was conducted from 1983-94.  The overall objective was to assist them in developing an autonomous capability for applying NDT, largely by providing support in areas of training.
<P>
The evaluation review carried out by independent experts in 1994 showed that the project had been instrumental in providing the region with a significant technological tool for the advancement of the region's industrialization.  This enabled the development of local industries and the displacement of NDT services previously provided from outside the region.  The project marked a significant change for the region's own technological development.  In previous years, the input from experts from outside of the region was the dominant mode of dissemination of NDT technology.  This was often in the context of regional courses, with typically one participant from each project country.  Gradually, the dominant mode changed from using external experts to using regional experts and further evolved to the use of national experts teaching courses solely in their respective countries.
<P>
<B>Health care.</B> Nuclear and related techniques play an especially vital role in health care and treatment.  Among important diagnostic tools is a technique known as radioimmunoassay.  With the IAEA's support, more than 250 radioinimunoassay laboratories have been established or upgraded in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and supplied with reagents in bulk form. has allowed recipient countries to provide reasonable clinical diagnostic services covering important substances such as hormones, vitamins, enzymes and even some tumor markers.  The cost of each test is less than US 50 cents per patient sample, which on average is ten times less than the application of complete commercial kits.  In some countries, where some of the primary reagents needed are being produced locally, the cost per test is significantly lower.  More important than the lower cost is the fact that many people now have access to reliable diagnostic tests that play a key role in the improvement of their health care and treatment.
<P>
<H3>Future directions</H3>
<P>
In its current and planned programmes, the IAEA is placing increasingly more emphasis on cost-effective projects that promise significant social and economic benefits, that have a lasting and environmentally sound impact on a country's development, and that clearly demonstrate the value of nuclear applications for end users.  The IAEA's Member States have strongly supported this move towards impact-oriented technical co-operation.  At an IAEA Technical Cooperation Policy Review Seminar in September 1994, for example, governmental representatives provided the Agency with valuable recommendations regarding the practical implementation of projects important to them.
<P>
Undoubtedly the major challenge facing the IAEA's technical co-operation programme in years ahead is the availability of sufficient financial resources to effectively carry out approved projects.  In terms of its funding base, the IAEA occupies a place far behind large bilateral and multilateral agencies.  Even so, the trend in contributions to the IAEA's technical co-operation programme over the past 5 years has been negative, and many sound projects have had to go unfunded.  In response to the situation, the IAEA has taken a number of administrative and programmatic measures intended to stretch its limited resources so as to obtain the best possible results.
<P>
These efforts are part of steps to improve programme efficiency, and to attract greater resources enabling the IAEA to enhance its support for technology-transfer activities that are not only operationally sound but visibly effective.  As the main channel for global nuclear co-operation, the IAEA possesses an exceptionally high level of technical expertise and experience to identify and carry out a multitude of projects that can make a lasting difference to a country's sustainable development.

<H2>Nuclear material accounting and control: Co-ordinating assistance to newly independent
States </H2>
<I>An overview of IAEA-supported activities to help former Soviet republics establish State
systems of accounting and control</I>
<P>
<A HREF=#author><B>by Sven Thorstensen</B></A>
<HR>
<P>
Nuclear trade and co-operation among States are essentially dependent upon effective and
credible safeguards. The disintegration of the former Soviet Union has resulted,<I> inter alia</I>, in the
emergence of a number of newly independent States (NIS). Many of them have nuclear
programmes. However, the nuclear infrastructure on which those programmes once rested is no
longer in place and needs to be reconstructed.
<P>
The application of IAEA safeguards depends for its effectiveness largely on the extent to which
governments ensure that operators keep accurate, precise and complete records; promptly send
the IAEA the required reports; employ reliable and accurate equipment for measurement and
analysis; take inventories of nuclear material at the prescribed intervals; and determine, at each
inventory taking, the amount of nuclear material unaccounted for.
<P>
In safeguards agreements pursuant to the <A HREF=/worldatom/glance/legal/npt.html>Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT)</a>, the State is required to establish and maintain a State System of Accounting and Control
(SSAC) of nuclear material within its territory, jurisdiction or control. Many of the NIS have
nuclear programmes that include uranium mining and refining, as well as other types of nuclear
activities.  States in this category are Armenia, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.
<P>
This article outlines work under way among the IAEA, its Member States, and the NIS relating
to the establishment and development in the NIS of SSACs of nuclear material. It describes
IAEA activities in the NIS, including fact-finding missions and technical visits, the successful
attempts to find donor States providing voluntary funding and expertise, and the co-ordination
of technical support between the IAEA and the donor States.
<P>
<H3>IAEA activities in the NIS</H3>
<P>
The IAEA has a direct interest in matters relating to international safeguards and
non-proliferation. To support NIS non-nuclear weapon States in meeting national and
international obligations, either assumed or in prospect, in the field of nuclear non-proliferation,
the IAEA embarked in 1992 on a number of activities aimed at helping them to establish and/or
further develop their SSACs.
<P> 
As in many countries, SSACs are also charged with responsibilities in physical protection,
import/export control, and regulatory matters. It became logical to incorporate these topics in the
support activities to SSACs for the NIS where such assistance would be required. In order to
cover all of these topics, extensive support from IAEA Member States (donor States) became
essential.
<P>
The work consisted of and continues to consist of carrying out fact-finding missions/technical
visits; finding interested donor States; and co-ordinating technical support.
<P>
<B>IAEA fact-finding missions/technical visits. </B>Beginning in 1992, fact-finding
missions have been carried out in many NIS. In 1992, they were carried out in Belarus,
Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. In 1993, such missions took place in Armenia, Estonia, Kyrgyzstan,
Latvia, Lithuania, and Uzbekistan. Further missions to Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan are
planned for l995. The objectives of these missions have been, <I>inter alia</I>, to inquire
about the timing of likely accession to the NPT and acceptance of technical visits to prepare for
the NPT; identify relevant contact persons and organizations; and identify and list needs as
regards co-ordinated technical support plans for each individual NIS.
<P>
In 1993 and 1994, technical visits were conducted to most major facilities in Armenia, Belarus,
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. The objectives of these visits were to obtain information
about the operator's nuclear material flows, quantities, categories, and measurement system;
further define lists of needs (i.e. requirements related to non-proliferation) for co-ordinated
technical support; identify safeguards equipment requirements; and demonstrate the verification
of nuclear material and equipment used.
<P>
Technical discussions and demonstrations also took place. These visits have been a valuable
means of supplying the basic information needed for the IAEA Department of Safeguards to
initiate preparations for implementing safeguards in the respective countries, and to familiarize
the relevant State and facility officials with the IAEA's procedures and requirements.
<P>
Those facilities which may become subject to safeguards have been identified and associated
information concerning nuclear material flow quantities and categories has been obtained. On the
basis of this information, safeguards equipment needs have been identified, budgeted for, and
initial purchases made for longer lead time items. Estimates of the requirements for inspection
resources have been made based upon draft safeguards approaches prepared or updated for all
major NIS facility types.
<P>
In discussions with facility operators, IAEA inspection procedures have been reviewed in detail,
the associated equipment demonstrated, and technical requirements documented for surveillance
equipment installation. At some sites, the nuclear material measurement capabilities of the
facilities have been reviewed with IAEA experts and compared with international standards to
help define  equipment needs . Through these interactions, the needs of the individual State for
assistance with infrastructure development and equipment have also been identified.
<P>
Discussions at all levels have also helped to identify hardware and training needs in the basic
SSAC infrastructure, including computers and software for nuclear materials accounting,
communication systems, and instrumentation used by State inspectors. Consultations are
continuing about the legal aspects of the NPT and safeguards agreements, and on facility design
verification procedures.
<P>
<B>Finding donor States</B>. From the outset, the IAEA recognized that it could not complete this
extensive work alone and would have to rely heavily on voluntary funding and expertise from
its Member States. The IAEA consequently compiled and sent to potential donors the lists of
needs, as discussed with the recipients. Being aware that some countries had already initiated
support activities to one or more NIS or were in the process of establishing bilateral agreements,
the IAEA expected that donor States would consider granting additional funds and harmonize
their support activities in a co-ordinated manner. On the basis of suggestions from some Member
States, a meeting was called in Vienna on 27-28 May 1993 where representatives from Australia,
Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Hungary, Japan, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom,
the United States, the Commission of the European Communities, and the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expressed their readiness to help the NIS
improve their SSACs in a co-ordinated manner. So far, seven countries have made funding
available and have been active or are expected soon to participate actively in actual support
activities. Additional countries are ready to be called upon to assist if the need arises.
<P>
<B>Co-ordinated technical support</B>. "Co-ordinated Technical Support"  is the term used to describe
support by the IAEA and donor States to the NIS in order to support SSACs at facility and State
levels, including physical protection and export/import. The "Co-ordinated Technical Support
Plan"  is approved by the State concerned and is intended to be a main tool in helping both State
and facility authorities in meeting their responsibilities. Co-ordination of efforts has since focused
on the preparation and subsequent implementation of these Plans for each individual NIS. They
identify the needs to be addressed, the timescale over which the associated activities are to be
conducted, and the areas of intended contribution from each of the donor States. The Plans
contain a phased approach to the support.
<P>
Phase I addresses immediate needs, with emphasis on support to existing authorities in
improving legislative infrastructure and on SSAC requirements, in particular in relation to
concluding and implementing a safeguards agreement with the IAEA. Phase II will include
completion of the legal infrastructure, improving operators' measurement systems and other
components of material control and accounting, physical protection, and export/import
control systems. Training is recognized as an important element in the successful transfer
of donor support and is included with each planned technical activity.
<P>
To date, such Plans have been agreed for Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, and
Ukraine; donor States have been identified, and Implementation/Co-ordination Committees
with responsible persons from each of the donor States and the IAEA have been established.
Representatives of donor States are presently making facility visits in order to familiarize
themselves with the areas, as identified in the Co-ordinated Technical Support Plan, for
which they have accepted responsibility. Funds have been made available to implement the
complete Plan for these States. Plans for the remaining NIS are in the process of being set
up. One donor State has offered its assistance to help the remaining NIS in setting up the
basic infrastructure of their SSACs; such assistance would contribute to achieving a certain
degree of compatibility among all NIS. Other donor States have expressed willingness to
contribute to the implementation of identified elements of the Plans in one or more of the
NIS. The IAEA will contact potential donor States to solicit funding and expertise in order
to cover the complete Plans for NIS.
<P>
<B>Additional assistance</B>. Additional support by donor States and the IAEA to the NIS has included
contributions to SSAC training activities organized by donor States and seminars on the
organization of SSACs in Ukraine and Kazakhstan. (See table.) These enjoyed broad NIS
participation.
<P>
The IAEA and donor States have also given legislative assistance to the NIS. This is aimed at
establishing a comprehensive framework of nuclear law covering all areas of nuclear activity.
Examples of recipients of such assistance are Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine. In 1993 in
Leiden, Netherlands, the IAEA also co-sponsored with the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD,
a Training Seminar for Lawyers and Regulators; a similar seminar also was held in 1994.
<P>
<H3>A co-operative, constructive approach</H3>
<P>
Soundly established SSACs are fundamental to a State's ability to benefit fully from the peaceful
uses of nuclear energy. Nuclear trade and co-operation among States are essentially dependent
upon effective and credible safeguards. These, in turn, rely heavily on SSACs.
<P> 
In newly independent States formed after the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, the
nuclear infrastructure needs to be reconstructed if the new States are to derive maximum benefit
from the peaceful exploitation of the atom. The IAEA, together with donor States, has been
helping the NIS to build up their respective nuclear infrastructures. Much of the activity relates
directly to the establishment of reliable SSACs. The IAEA and donor States are therefore
fulfilling a vital function in the NIS. Much remains to be done, but much is already under way.
<P>
The co-operative spirit of all parties involved is very much in evidence; the NIS have been very
open and have provided IAEA and donor States access to their nuclear programmes and, to a
large extent, to facilities without a safeguards agreement in place. Also, donor States, recognizing
the common interest in strengthening the SSAC infrastructure in the NIS, have responded in a
very positive manner.

<H2>Latin America's Treaty of Tlatelolco: Instrument for peace and development</H2>
<I>Updated in the 1990s, the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America
sets up a militarily denuclearized zone</I>
<P>
<B>by Enrique Román-Morey</B>
<HR>
<P>
More than 30 years ago, in October 1962, the world witnessed one of the most serious
confrontations to have occurred between two nuclear powers   the  Missile Crisis . At the time,
Latin America viewed the incident from various angles: it saw international peace and security
as basic necessities, and its own unwillingness to be party to military conflicts between the major
powers. At the same time, it saw the importance of not being prevented from mastering nuclear
technology for peaceful purposes and from applying it to promote the economic development of
its peoples.
<P>
All this was uppermost in the minds of those who subsequently became responsible for
negotiating the text of an historic document: the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons
in Latin America, now usually called the  Tlatelolco Treaty  in recognition of the Mexican site
in which it was opened for signature.
<P>
Thirty years ago, the Cold War in a bipolar world was the frame of reference. The parameters
then were a devastating world war that, for the first time, had brought home the horrors inherent
in the military use of nuclear energy and the incipient awareness worldwide of the benefits to be
derived from the use of atoms for peace. Latin America was convinced that, faced with the
permanent threat of nuclear confrontation between the nuclear superpowers, it must present to
the world a legal instrument. Although novel for its time, that instrument would be permanent
in spirit and would demonstrate that alongside national interests there existed interests of the
international community. These interests touched, most particularly, those of the world's
populated regions which, without being parties to a decision to intervene in a war, would
nevertheless become involved in one. In Latin America, people knew they would face a
catastrophic scenario only in the event of a world conflict. The total interdependence in which
we live and, above all, the explosive and radiative power of the atom when used to destroy show
clearly that we are not immune to what surrounds us.
Traditionally, Latin America has been an inexhaustible source of ideas and actions, and
international law has not escaped the effects of the fertile Latin American imagination. Latin
Americans did not invent the wheel, but some general principles of international law that today
serve as a basis for the peaceful co-existence of nations have Latin American parentage.
Similarly, in the field of non-proliferation, the region of Latin America and the Caribbean was
the first to make its voice heard, and it proclaimed its views loudly. After Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, one thing crucial to the question of non-proliferation was absolutely clear   the
undeniable superiority of nuclear over conventional weapons.
<P>
<H3>The Treaty's origins and key elements</H3>
It took more than 4 years of constant effort and difficult negotiations to formulate in a legal
document the obligations of the contracting parties within the Latin American region and that of
the nuclear powers to respect the region's desired military denuclearized status. On 14 February
1967, the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America was opened for
signature at Tlatelolco, Mexico.
<P>
Initially, only 18 countries of the region signed it. Since then, 28 years have passed, and the
process of consolidating the military denuclearization regime and its control system in Latin
America and the Caribbean is almost complete. This has involved the joint efforts of the three
main organs constituting the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America
and the Caribbean (OPANAL)   namely the General Conference, the Council, and the General
Secretariat   and of the Good Offices Committee. The Committee is a specially created
subsidiary body formed by Costa Rica, Jamaica, Peru, and Venezuela and chaired by Mexico (the
Mexican Government being the Depositary Government of the Treaty). It has made an effective
contribution to the consolidation of the Treaty's zone of application.
<P>
The drafters of the Tlatelolco Treaty molded a conceptually rich international instrument. During
the almost three decades that it has been in force, the Treaty has served as an example for the
international community. Now, in the momentous times of flux in which we are living, Latin
America and the Caribbean is more and more insistently urging the international community to
focus on non-proliferation with the ultimate goal of complete disarmament, peace and
development for all.
<P>
The end of the Cold War and bipolarism demands new concepts of security and development.
A number of factors are working to strengthen multilateral co-operation on a day-to-day basis.
These factors include changes in the thinking of the nuclear powers, the resurgence of densely
populated regions interested in their own economic and social development rather than in
armaments, and the unmistakable winds of universal democracy. A new concept   the economic
and social development of nations   must replace the traditional ideology-based concept of
security and the consequent arms race.  For Latin America and the Caribbean, there are other
priorities in daily life, such as combating extreme poverty, supporting health and education
programmes, and developing basic industries such as agriculture and mining, which are the
foundations of development. The region is becoming aware that those priorities call for the
extensive peaceful utilization of the most powerful form of energy   nuclear energy.
Some elements make the Tlatelolco Treaty a unique legal instrument. They include the Treaty's
indefinite duration (Article 31); the fact that it can be amended at any time and thus adapted in
the light of recent developments (Article 30); the provision that it  shall not be subject to
reservations  (Article 28); the full protection of the Treaty's zone of application through negative
security assurances, with the nuclear powers and other States situated outside the Latin American
continent undertaking to recognize and respect it (Additional Protocols I and II); the definition
of  nuclear weapon  (Article 5); the commitment of the Contracting Parties to  use exclusively
for peaceful purposes the nuclear material and facilities under their jurisdiction  (Article 1); and
  finally and most importantly  the enshrinement in the Treaty of the general principle of
international law that militarily denuclearized zones are not an end in themselves, but rather a
means of achieving general and complete disarmament (Preamble).
<P>
With these elements, the Tlatelolco Treaty stands in full agreement with the purposes and
principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. The Treaty further recognizes and
pinpoints a general principle of international law, makes it incontestable and applicable, regulates
it and controls it in such a way as to permit its updating and adaptation in the light of new
circumstances in the world, ensuring that it is respected in a major inhabited part of the planet.
The Treaty's letter and spirit may serve as an example to other populated regions. In this respect,
Latin America and the Caribbean welcomes the efforts being made by peoples and governments
in other regions to establish militarily denuclearized zones.
<P>
Within this general framework and changing times, steps were taken in the 1990s to update the
Tlatelolco Treaty. The Contracting Parties approved a series of amendments which today make
it easier for countries in the region to accede fully to the Treaty. Thus:
<UL>
<LI>On 3 July 1990, during the 7th extraordinary session of OPANAL's General Conference,
it was decided that the words  and the Caribbean  should be added to the official title of the
Treaty so that it would cover all the States of the Caribbean lying within its zone of application.
<LI>On 10 May 1991, during the 13th session of OPANAL's General Conference, the zone of
application was updated through a recasting of the old Article 25, use being made of  wording
similar to that of Article 8 of the amended Charter of the Organization of American States
(OAS), so that all independent States in the region could join the military denuclearization
regime. This important amendment made it possible for Caribbean States such as Belize and
Guyana to accede to the Treaty.
<LI>On 26 August 1992, during its 8th extraordinary session, OPANAL's General Conference
approved amendments to Articles 14, 15, 16, 19, and 20 relating to the verification and control
system established by the Treaty. The purpose of these amendments was to strengthen the
verification system  it being recognized that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
was the only organization capable of carrying out special inspections requested by parties to the
Treaty  while upholding the principle that the organs of OPANAL would continue to be
responsible for monitoring the application of the Treaty's control system. It should be emphasized
that, although the approved amendments modify the verification system, none of the
modifications alters the fundamental principles or the essence of the Tlatelolco Treaty.
</UL>
<H3>Recent accessions and status</H3>
These important amendments made it possible for States in the region with significant nuclear
activities to become full members of the Tlatelolco system. Thus, during 1994, Argentina and
Chile became members on 18 January, Brazil on 30 May and Belize on 9 November. Guyana
signed and ratified the Treaty on 18 January 1995. Most of the Member States have signed the
amendments and are engaged in an accelerated process of ratification in accordance with their
various national legislative requirements. According to the Government of Mexico, the Depositary
Government, the amendments are in force for those States which have signed and ratified them
and which have formulated the waiver referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 29 of the Treaty.
<P>
As of February 1995, the status of the Tlatelolco Treaty was as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Of the 33 States making up the regional group of Latin America and the Caribbean, only
one has not signed the Tlatelolco Treaty. Cuba has officially stated its intention to accede to the
Treaty and to become a full member of the Tlatelolco system in the near future. 
<LI>Of the 32 signatory States, only three have not yet completed the ratification process
(Guyana, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia).
<LI>Altogether 29 States of the region are full members of the Tlatelolco system.
<LI>In addition, all the objectives and provisions of the Tlatelolco Treaty are fully respected by
the United States, the Russian Federation, France, the United Kingdom, China, and the
Netherlands, all of which have signed and ratified Additional Protocols I and II.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Peaceful uses of nuclear energy</H3>
Although OPANAL's primary task  has been to consolidate the militarily denuclearized zone, it
has never forgotten that its major future task is to promote access to nuclear technology for
exclusively peaceful purposes by establishing co-operation programmes and thereby to prevent
a further widening of the gap between developed and developing countries. It therefore welcomed
the establishment, by the IAEA, of a Regional Co-operative Arrangement for the Promotion of
Nuclear Science and Technology in Latin America and the Caribbean (known as ARCAL) and
has indicated through various resolutions of its General Conference its interest in being
represented at ARCAL meetings as an observer. Since then, following an agreement in September
1994 by ARCAL countries at a meeting in Vienna,  OPANAL has been able to participate as an -
observer. 
<P>
With the universalization of the Treaty's zone of application and its consolidation at the regional
level, OPANAL must expand its activities. This will inevitably also involve a decision by
OPANAL's Member States to modernize the General Secretariat   something which should
undoubtedly be done soon. Its links with the IAEA will help OPANAL to carry out its tasks in
accordance with the undertaking of the Contracting Parties   expressed in Article 1 of the
Tlatelolco Treaty    to use exclusively for peaceful purposes the nuclear material and facilities
which are under their jurisdiction . From the time that OPANAL was established   in fact, even
before the Tlatelolco Treaty came into existence   the Latin American region has been receiving
invaluable assistance from the IAEA. It is hoped that such assistance will continue   not in
order to duplicate efforts but in order to combine them in the interests of development.
<p>
The programmes implemented during the first ARCAL stage have included projects on the
development of nuclear science and technology, the utilization of research reactors, the
improvement of cereals through mutation breeding, the radioimmunoassay of thyroid hormones,
nuclear information, and other projects with a high scientific and social value for our region.
Planned projects include those on radiation protection, immunoassay in animal production and
health, applications of isotope techniques in hydrology, the production and control of
radiopharmaceuticals, industrial applications of nuclear technology, the maintenance of nuclear
instrumentation, the control of radiation sources, mutation induction in relation to other
biotechnologies for the improvement of crops in Latin America, and the improvement of plant
nutrition and of soil and water resources management using nuclear and other techniques. These
projects will undoubtedly make an important contribution to the development of agriculture,
medicine, and industry in Latin America and the Caribbean. It is to be hoped that, although each
ARCAL country participates only in the project or projects of particular interest to it, most will
participate in the majority of projects.
<P>
The ideal that nuclear energy should not be the privilege of just a few States will be actively
pursued through the main and subsidiary organs created by the Tlatelolco Treaty. For this reason,
OPANAL believes in the need to build more bridges between countries that are highly developed
as regards nuclear science and technology and countries that are less developed, so that the 21st
century does not find us in the midst of an apocalypse of destitution, disease, and hunger on one
hand and opulence and full economic and social development on the other.
<P>
The historic effort of Latin America and the Caribbean to achieve full implementation of the
Tlatelolco Treaty should serve as an example to other densely populated regions with a growing
interest in attaining similar goals. The day-to-day activities of the IAEA   the leading world
organization in the nuclear field   and the international community's efforts directed towards
the conclusion of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament agreements will help create a world
of maximum social and economic development in an environment of peace leading to general
and complete disarmament.
<P>
It is our firm conviction that the greatest form of energy known to humanity   nuclear energy
  should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. There should be a total prohibition
worldwide of its use for military purposes. In other words, let us denuclearize war and nuclearize
peace! We are a few months away from the 50th anniversary of the first and, fortunately, only
nuclear holocaust. The best present that humanity could give itself would be a total and perpetual
ban on nuclear weapons.

<H2>Nuclear co-operation in Africa:  Developing expertise and resources</H2>
<I>Through a regional co-operative agreement known as AFRA,
African countries are working to solve common problems</I>
<P>
<A HREF=#author><B>by Ali Boussaha and Mokdad Maksoudi</B></A>
<HR>
<P>
During the past decade, regional activities in the field of nuclear science and
technology have assumed greater importance in Africa. This is especially the case in areas of
common interest, such as radiation protection and safety, agriculture, nuclear medicine, and
maintenance of scientific instruments. Today, important activities are being carried out through
a regional mechanism known as AFRA, which stands for the African Co-operative Agreement
for Research, Development, and Training Related to Nuclear Science and Technology.
AFRA is an inter-governmental arrangement established at the initiative of several African
countries and concluded under auspices of the IAEA. In September 1994, the current agreement,
which entered into force on 4 April 1990, was extended for another 5 years, to the year 2000.
<P> 
To date, 19 countries have become members:  Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Nigeria, Madagascar,
Libya, Morocco, Kenya, Sudan, Ghana, Tanzania, Mauritius, Cameroon, South Africa, Zaire,
Ethiopia, Zambia, Niger, and Côte d'Ivoire.
<P>
Since its inception, AFRA has proved to be an important mechanism to promote regional
co-operation, to co-ordinate intellectual and physical resources, and to enhance capabilities in the
diversified areas of nuclear technology. Countries participating in AFRA aspire to build on
achievements attained under national efforts or with IAEA assistance, so that available resources,
facilities, and expertise can be most effectively shared and not unnecessarily duplicated. Financial
support is provided by the IAEA from its own budget and from extrabudgetary contributions
made by donor countries and organizations. AFRA countries also provide in-kind contributions
by, for example, hosting and supporting training activities.
<P>
This article provides an overview of activities being carried out through AFRA in various fields
where nuclear techniques are being applied. It additionally addresses areas in which countries are
working together with the IAEA to strengthen their basic national infrastructures related to the
safe and effective use of nuclear and related technologies.
<P>
<H3> Addressing issues of development</H3>
<P>
<B>Food and agriculture</B>. The agriculture sector is the mainstay of the economy of many African
countries and sustains the lives of more than 80% of the population. Many adverse factors affect
development   unfavourable climatic conditions, recurrent droughts, insufficient water resources
in the Sahel, North, Eastern and Austral Africa, and accelerating environmental degradation,
notably desertification, deforestation, declining soil fertility, and erosion.
<P>
Analysis of current trends reveals that in order to meet the needs of the continent's population,
a 70% increase in crop production up to the year 2010 will have to be attained through yield
increases and intensified farming. This will require an agricultural development strategy that
combines the imperative of food security with the rational management of natural resources and
protection of the environment. 
<P>
Within the agricultural sector, the rearing of livestock is a key component. On average, when
both their direct and indirect contributions are taken into account, livestock account for half of
the agricultural output and may represent up to 25% of the gross domestic product of African
countries as a whole. The productivity of livestock greatly affects the livelihood of small holdings
that constitute the majority of farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Besides being a source of
draught power, they produce meat, milk, and wool for local populations and, in some countries,
for export. 
<P>
The AFRA programme in food and agriculture supports collaborative efforts to use appropriate
technologies to consolidate and improve research capabilities for crop and livestock production.
Current projects deal with food preservation using irradiation technology, animal reproduction
and nutrition, and crop improvement by mutation breeding and biotechnology.
<P>
<B><I>Food preservation</I></B>. Post-harvest losses of foodstuffs in Africa sometimes run as high as 50%, and
the technology of food irradiation is seen as playing a potentially valuable role  in reducing these
losses, especially for grain, vegetables, root plants and fruits. Several African countries have
shown keen interest in the use of this technology for food preservation and some have already
established pilot food irradiation facilities to pave the way for the introduction of the technology
on a commercial scale. This common interest has prompted Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana,
Kenya, Libya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Tunisia,
and Zaire to initiate an AFRA programme based on mutual co-operation and sharing of
experience. Activities were initiated in 1991 and since then 55 scientists from these countries
have been trained in basic aspects of food irradiation technology.
<P>
<B><I>Animal reproduction and nutrition</I></B>. Although many African countries have established national
laboratories, mainly through IAEA assistance, for studies on animal reproduction and nutrition,
many of them realized the need to enhance their facilities. As a result, they initiated an AFRA
programme to use standardized services for  radioimmunoassay (RIA) and for blood nutrient
analysis, and to facilitate co-ordination and promote the exchange of information and experience.
Eleven countries now are participating in this endeavour, and their present emphasis is on
conducting intensive training courses for scientists. Areas covered include milk production and
reproductive performance of indigenous and crossbred dairy cattle; supplementary feeding
strategies using locally available feed resources; an investigation into the effect of
trypanosomiasis on the reproductive performance of goats; a field study to investigate the
influence of mineral deficiency on fertility of dairy cattle and camels and its impact on
productivity; and a project to develop facilities and sustainable systems for agriculture and animal
production in desert conditions.
<P>
<B><I>Plant breeding and genetics</I></B>. Africa's future food production depends to a significant extent on
the ability of crops to tolerate difficult soil and water conditions. The application of
radiation-induced mutation techniques combined with selected biotechnologies can play an
important role, and most AFRA States have established national capabilities in mutation breeding.
Some of them are already using their irradiation facilities for routine irradiation of seeds and
plantlets in efforts to breed crops that are more resistant to disease or which require little water,
for example. In-vitro culture laboratories are now established  in at least five countries. 
<P>
IAEA-supported activities have led to some achievements, in particular the development of
improved varieties of cassava, plantain, and wild African rice. In general, however the results
have not yet been transferred to the end users. The need to consolidate experience and to bridge
the gap between research laboratories and farmers prompted 12 AFRA countries to establish a
regional programme for this purpose. So far, the activities have concentrated on training, and
plant breeders from 11 AFRA countries have been trained.

<B>Human health</B>. In one form or another, most hospitals in Africa use radiation and radionuclides
for medical and biological purposes, primarily for the treatment of cancer and for medical
diagnosis. RIA is currently widely used as a diagnostic technique of thyroid-related hormones,
a part of efforts to investigate ever-increasing thyroid and iodine deficiency disorders. However,
its application requires reagents which are imported by most countries in Africa in the form of
prepared kits. The quality of the assays is often jeopardized by limited access to foreign exchange
and by uncertainties associated with importation procedures and unreliable logistics.
<P> 
An AFRA project was initiated in 1991 to develop the capability for the local preparation of
radioimmunoassay reagents. Activities have focused on the introduction of bulk reagent
methodology, standard RIA practices including quality control, and RIA data-processing
procedures so as to initiate local production of at least some of the simpler primary reagents
required.
<P>
By now, most of the participating laboratories have acquired the technical expertise and
established the facilities to prepare locally a number of required reagents. Sixty-four participants
from 10 countries have benefitted from training events organized under the project in bulk
reagent methodology, data processing in radioimmunoassay, and the preparation of basic reagents.
In addition to these achievements, a regional external quality scheme is being set up to pave the
way for gradual introduction of early screening of neonatal
hypothyroidism.
<P>
<B>Industrial applications</B>. A number of industrial applications of nuclear techniques have
attracted the interest of AFRA States. They include non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques,
widely used throughout the world in the quality control of industrial products, and radiation
processing, mainly for radiation sterilization of single-use medical supplies and
pharmaceuticals.
<P>
Several African countries have taken steps over the past years towards establishing NDT
facilities. However, the infrastructure in the region is still in general inadequate and NDT services
are performed by foreign companies. While  NDT training opportunities are regularly available
in a few countries (Algeria, Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, and Tunisia), the certification and
qualification of NDT personnel relies mainly on programmes of the IAEA and other
organizations. In 1993, some AFRA countries initiated NDT activities which included the
organization of several training events on certification and qualification of NDT personnel. They
have resulted in the training of 40 persons from 9 countries in two NDT techniques (ultrasonic
and radiographic testing.)
<P>
In the field of radiation processing, AFRA States in 1991 initiated a project on the radiation
sterilization of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. Through this project, 30 radiation
technologists from eight countries have received training. No further activities are foreseen in this
field, however, because of the lack of irradiation processing facilities in participating countries.
<P>
<H3>Strengthening nuclear infrastructures</H3>
<P>
<B>Radiation protection and safety</B>. As the use of radioisotopes and radiation technologies has
grown in AFRA States over the years, so has the IAEA's assistance in areas of radiation
protection and radioactive waste management. The basic infrastructure for radiation protection
and radioactive waste management requires the setting up of a competent national authority, the
establishment of a legislative and regulatory framework, and the development of operational
services for the proper enforcement of radiation safety standards.
<P>
However, for various reasons, in a number of countries radiation safety infrastructures are still
either deficient or essentially non-existent, which impedes the development of nuclear technology
programmes. As to radioactive waste management, expertise in the region is limited.  Although
radiation sources and radioactive materials are essentially used in connection with medical care
and in limited research and industrial applications, the fate of the generated wastes  remains an
issue of major concern in the absence of comprehensive waste management strategies.  The issues
which need to be addressed include proper handling of different types of radioactive wastes,
adequate treatment and conditioning, and safe disposal. An AFRA programme aims to improve
the managerial capability in the region to manage radioactive wastes properly; and to harmonize
environmental monitoring approaches and measuring methods.
<P>
Under a project on waste management initiated in 1991, several regional training courses and
workshops were organized which enabled about 80 scientists to gain practical knowledge and
skills, particularly regarding radioactive spent sources generated from hospitals and research
laboratories. Current activities include the design of a waste processing and storage facility for
the management of low-level radioactive wastes in line with the needs of most AFRA countries.
<P>
The project on environmental radiation measurement and harmonization started in 1993.  A
mechanism has been established under the project in close collaboration with the IAEA's
Seibersdorf Laboratories to carry out programmes on quality assurance and intercomparison of
gamma spectrometry data of environmental samples. Training of scientists in gamma
spectrometry and other analytical techniques represents an important component of the project;
30 scientists from eight AFRA countries have already been trained.
<P>
<B>Nuclear instrumentation</B>. Nuclear-related activities in AFRA countries involve specific and often
complex equipment and microprocessor-based electronic instrumentation. These tools are often
used in an unfavourable working environment (power disturbances, dust, high humidity and
temperature). Furthermore, most instruments which are imported are not serviced in the region
owing to lack of suppliers' representatives. With IAEA support, most AFRA States have
established service and maintenance facilities well equipped for preventive maintenance and
repair. However, all of them suffer from the turnover of key personnel, shortage of spare parts
and appropriate technical documentation for servicing, and lack of opportunities for exchange of
experience with other institutions in the region.
<P>
Fourteen AFRA States decided to adopt a regional approach to consolidate or upgrade their
national instrumentation and electronics laboratories for the repair and preventive maintenance
of nuclear and medical equipment, and to develop adequate capabilities in the designing and
manufacturing of simple instruments to sustain research activities. The proposed approach offers
many advantages, including exchange of experience, cost-effective local training of personnel,
shared use of expensive equipment, and implementation of common policies to tackle
instrumentation problems, especially with regard to maintenance and utilization. Training of
electronic engineers and technicians in the field of repair of instruments and preventive
maintenance is given particular attention. Presently, 20 technicians from 10 AFRA countries have
been trained to be trainers in their home institutions.
<P>
<H3>Future activities and prospects</H3>
<P>
AFRA countries have decided to particularly intensify their co-operative activities in a number
of areas. One area is food irradiation, where training, demonstrations, workshops, and
techno-economic feasibility studies of the technology will be emphasized so as to enable each
AFRA country to acquire the necessary information for decision-making.
<P>
Another area of special interest is radiotherapy. Costly radiotherapy facilities for curative and
palliative treatment of cancer have been established in many African countries.  However, most
of these facilities are not providing optimal services owing to several factors. These factors
include the inadequate supply of indigenous specialists, such as radiotherapists, medical
physicists, and radiographers, which is limited by the high cost of overseas training and the
attractive job opportunities offered by foreign clinics to graduates. A related problem affecting
the quality of treatment  appears to be the various standards of quality for radiotherapy, which
results from the fact that the practice covers a wide range of techniques and approaches. Several
AFRA States are now working to introduce a regional quality assurance programme to improve
their national capabilities for radiotherapy practice, to optimize the utilization of existing
radiotherapy facilities by introducing new clinical techniques in teletherapy and brachytherapy,
and to upgrade and support existing regional training centres to enable them to answer the most
pressing needs of the region for trained personnel. These activities should also contribute to
increased awareness in countries about rational and comprehensive programmes for early
detection of cancer.
<P>
Particular attention also is being attached to the further strengthening of basic infrastructures to
promote nuclear technology development. Considering the increasing number of research reactors
in the region   there are now six operational and three under construction   some AFRA States
intend to adopt a common approach to optimize the utilization of these facilities and to enhance
their capabilities for safely and efficiently operating the units.
<P> 
<B>Assessing achievements</B>.  During the first 5 years of its existence, AFRA concentrated on laying
down the foundation that can best enable African countries to translate their commitment to
regional co-operation into technically and economically sound co-operative projects. Its first
phase  has successfully established a suitable  scientific framework in Africa which enables
African scientists and technicians to share the available resources and facilities, to exchange
information and experience, and to help those countries  still in need of expertise in the field of
nuclear science and technology. This achievement contributed a great deal to increasing
awareness among AFRA countries that  regional co-operation holds considerable benefits.
Another important result is the better understanding of the infrastructure and the expertise in the
nuclear field that is available in the region. At the same time, there has been greater appreciation
of the many constraints and weaknesses that still prevent nuclear techniques from contributing
effectively to the region's social and economic development.
<P> 
Modest as they are, these achievements  have strengthened the concept of regional co-operation
and self-reliance in the continent. Greater use is being made of experts and lecturers from the
region. Moreover, because AFRA has strengthened personal contacts and relationships between
African scientists and between their institutions, there are now more and more AFRA countries
offering training opportunities. The region's most developed countries are expected to play a
paramount future role in further consolidating the spirit of mutual assistance and regional
co-operation by opening their available facilities to other countries and by financially supporting
AFRA activities.
<P>
AFRA also has greatly contributed towards the elimination of some barriers that were preventing
any institutionalized co-operation in nuclear science and technology from taking place in the
region. During its second phase, from 1995-2000, the AFRA programme will continue placing
greater emphasis on building up regional capacities, and on improving the programme's 
operation, management, and scientific scope.

It is hoped that through these initiatives, and continuing financial support, the foundation
for nuclear-related regional co-operation in Africa will not only be strengthened but
increasingly tailored to the conditions and needs of the region.

<H2>Nuclear verification in South Africa</H2>
<I>Verifying South Africa's declared nuclear inventory, and the termination of its weapons
programme, was a complex task</I>
<P>
<B>by Adolf von Baeckmann, Gary Dillon and Demetrius Perricos</B>
<HR>
South Africa's accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) on
10 July 1991 was promptly followed by the signing of a comprehensive safeguards agreement
with the IAEA on 16 September 1991. Four days later, the IAEA General Conference adopted
a resolution aimed at ensuring early implementation of the safeguards agreement and verification
of  the completeness of the inventory of South Africa's nuclear installations and material.
 <P>
In November 1991, a team of senior IAEA safeguards officials specially appointed by the
Agency's Director General carried out the first inspections under the comprehensive safeguards
agreement. The activities to verify the correctness of South Africa's declared inventory of nuclear
material extended over several months and involved long-established measures. These included
the examination of contemporary operating and accounting records, and analysis of the nature and
quantity of nuclear material. South Africa's extensive nuclear fuel cycle made the task complex,
requiring considerable inspection resources and extensive co-operation from South African
authorities regarding the provision of access to defunct facilities and historical operating records. 
<P>
The task was further complicated when, on 24 March 1993, State President de Klerk announced
that South Africa had developed and subsequently dismantled a "limited nuclear deterrent
capability'' involving the design and manufacture of seven gun-assembled devices. The news
prompted the IAEA to augment its safeguards team in South Africa with, among other specialists,
nuclear weapons experts. The team's assignment was extended to include assessing the status of
the former nuclear weapons programme and ascertaining that all nuclear material involved in the
programme had been recovered and placed under safeguards.
<P>
Over the months that followed, the team thoroughly examined detailed records and verified the
inventories of nuclear materials in South Africa. As a result, it was able to conclude that there
were no indications to suggest that the initial inventory is incomplete or that the South African
nuclear weapons programme had not been completely terminated and dismantled.
<P>
This article highlights the IAEA's verification activities in South Africa and the main activities
associated with its assessment of the termination of South Africa's former nuclear weapons
programme.
<P>
<H3>Verifying the correctness of South Africa's declared nuclear inventory</H3>
As required under the comprehensive safeguards agreement, South Africa submitted to the IAEA
an initial report of its nuclear programme. The initial report is a comprehensive document and
includes quantitative data on all types of nuclear material, on a facility-by-facility basis. It is
expanded by attachments which provide detail on the location and the number of items of nuclear
material contained in each respective facility. 
<P>
For the IAEA, it was therefore possible -- on the basis of the data contained in the initial report
and subsequent inventory changes -- to establish an itemized list of each facility's nuclear
material inventory. Verification of such itemized lists was carried out during the first few months
of the implementation of the comprehensive safeguards agreement. This was done in accordance
with the requirements for physical inventory verification (PIV) specified in the IAEA 1991-95
Safeguards Criteria, using established accountancy verification measures.
<P>
Unlike other States which had entered into comprehensive safeguards agreements, South Africa
had been operating a number of nuclear facilities, of unique indigenous origin, that previously
had not been subject to safeguards. Details of their design and operation were thus relatively
unknown to the IAEA at the time the comprehensive safeguards agreement was concluded. 
<P>
This situation made it necessary to devote considerable effort to understanding the facility
processes. This would enable establishment of  workable safeguards approaches for interim
implementation during the period in which the facility attachment would be negotiated. This
process was facilitated through a joint seminar. The meeting provided the opportunity for the
IAEA to explain the accountancy procedures appertaining to a comprehensive safeguards
agreement (INFCIRC/153-type) and for the South African State System of Accounting and
Control (SSAC) and facility operators to provide insight into the facilities and their operating
procedures.
<P>
Since the time of the "initial inspections" in late 1991, verification activities carried out in South
Africa have continued to be based on the IAEA 1991-95 Safeguards Criteria. In October 1992,
a near-simultaneous PIV, involving all South African facilities, was successfully carried out. All
quantity goals were attained during that first material balance period. Similar exercises were
carried out in August 1993 and October 1994.
<P>
As might be expected, it proved necessary to make a number of corrections to the data included
in the initial report. This resulted from the continuing efforts of the SSAC to ensure the accuracy
of the data, errors identified during the inspection process, and corrections to estimations resulting
from measurements made by facility operators after issuance of the initial report. This latter
aspect was particularly relevant in the case of material recovered as a result of decontamination
of plant components.
<P>
At present, facility attachments are in force for six facilities and it is intended to complete
negotiations for the remaining facilities during 1995.
<P>
<H3>Assessing the completeness of South Africa's declared nuclear inventory </H3>
An important aspect of the IAEA's safeguards implementation in South Africa was the
assessment of the completeness of the declared nuclear inventory, which is extensive. The
complex task was carried out as a separate exercise by a team of senior members of the IAEA
Department of Safeguards specifically appointed for the purpose by the Director General. It
required considerable inspection resources and co-operation from the State authorities regarding
the provision of access to defunct facilities and historical operating records.
<P>
A practical basis was established through which the mutual consistency of the inventory of
nuclear installations and material -- and hence their completeness -- could be determined. The
declared inventory was first evaluated with respect to production, imports, and usage. Then the
isotopic balance of the inventory was calculated and compared with its natural uranium origin.
<P>
Through this process, the declared inventory was found to be consistent with the declared
production and usage data, but the calculated isotopic balance indicated "apparent discrepancies"
with respect to the highly enriched uranium (HEU) produced by the defunct pilot enrichment
plant (called the Y-plant) and with respect to the low-enriched uranium (LEU) produced by the
semi-commercial enrichment plant (called the Z-plant). The direction of these "apparent
discrepancies" could be interpreted to indicate that an amount of uranium-235 was unaccounted
for.
<P>
Having regard to the period of time involved (for the Y-plant in particular) and the absence of
accurate accountancy of the depleted uranium waste stream, such "apparent discrepancies" were
not unexpected. It was, however, considered necessary to continue efforts to further clarify them,
with priority being given to the Y-plant data. Further examination of records, particularly those
covering the recovery of HEU material following the shutdown of the plant, resulted in a
significant reduction of the magnitude of the "apparent discrepancy".
<P>
To supplement these activities, an exhaustive examination of the performance of the Y-plant over
its entire operating history was undertaken. This examination involved the analysis of data from
several thousand operating records, which detailed the plant status, on a daily basis, in terms of
availability of separating modules, the feed rate and the assay of feed, product, and tail streams.
Technical documents describing phenomena which had affected the plant performance were also
studied.
<P>
The results of this examination showed that the amount of HEU declared to have been produced
by the Y-plant was consistent with the plant's production capacity.
<P>
On the basis of these studies the IAEA determined that it was reasonable to conclude that the
uranium-235 balance of the HEU, LEU, and depleted uranium produced by the Y-plant was
consistent with the natural uranium feed; and that the amounts of HEU that could have been
produced by the plant were consistent with the amounts declared in the initial report.
<P>
The operating records of the Z-plant were subject to detailed scrutiny which enabled the plant
operation to be modelled, on a daily basis, from its very beginning to the day of the initial
inventory. A comparison of records showed, for a certain period of plant operation, that the
amount of U-235 transferred to depleted uranium waste storage as indicated in the operating
records was substantially more than that recorded in the accounting records. Further examination
of records and measurement of samples of stored depleted uranium confirmed that the data
recorded in the accounting records were based on inaccurate nominal values and that the data
contained in the operating records more correctly reflected the actual material transfers. 
<P>
The consequential corrections to the records to take account of this finding essentially resolved
the "apparent discrepancy" in the previously calculated isotopic balance for the Z-plant. In
addition, some other less prominent errors and omissions were identified in the initial report and
their correction contributed to the conclusion that isotopic balance of the Z-plant was satisfactory.
<P>
<H3>Ascertaining the status of South Africa's former nuclear weapons programme</H3>
The inventory of HEU declared by South Africa in its initial report was substantial. The IAEA
recognized that this material could have been taken to indicate that a significant component of
the HEU inventory had been recovered from an abandoned nuclear weapons programme or, less
likely, had been accumulated to supply a planned nuclear weapons programme which had been
abandoned prior to its implementation.
<P>
South Africa had no obligation to declare what had been the past purpose of this material.
Equally, the primary task of the IAEA was to ascertain that all nuclear material had been
declared and placed under safeguards; priority was given to this task during 1992.
<P>
In addition to the established accountancy verification measures, the IAEA, acting on information
received from Member States, carried out a number of inspections. They included the taking of
environmental samples, at a location that was later declared to be an unused nuclear weapons test
facility in the Kalahari desert and at a number of abandoned buildings (including a general
purpose critical facility) located just outside the Pelindaba security fence. The South African
officials were very co-operative in facilitating access to these locations but claimed lack of
detailed knowledge of their past use.
<P>
It is now a matter of record that, on 24 March 1993, President de Klerk, in a speech broadcast
to the South African Parliament, made a declaration that "at one stage, South Africa did, indeed,
develop a limited nuclear deterrent capability''.
<P>
President de Klerk's statement included a description of the scope and objective of the
"capability" and the rationale for its abandonment and South Africa's accession to the NPT.
It is significant to note that on the day of the declaration, two members of the IAEA team were
present at the Atomic Energy Corporation (AEC), Pelindaba. They were carrying out follow-up
actions directed towards the clarification of the "apparent discrepancy" in the isotopic balance
of the HEU material produced by the Y-plant. On the day after the declaration, these two team
members made a preliminary visit to a number of key facilities concerned with the abandoned
nuclear weapons programme.
<P>
Over the following 5-month period, the team, augmented by nuclear weapons experts, carried out
inspections at a number of facilities and locations that had been declared to have been involved
in the former nuclear weapons programme. The objectives of these inspections were to:
<UL>
<LI>gain assurance that all nuclear material used in the nuclear weapons programme had been
returned to peaceful usage and had been placed under IAEA safeguards;
<LI>assess that all non-nuclear weapons specific components of the devices had been destroyed;
that all laboratory and engineering facilities involved in the programme had been fully
decommissioned and abandoned or converted to commercial non-nuclear usage or peaceful
nuclear usage; that all weapons-specific equipment had been destroyed and that all other
equipment had been converted to commercial non-nuclear usage or peaceful nuclear usage;
<LI>obtain information regarding the dismantling programme, the destruction of design and
manufacturing information, including drawings, and the philosophy followed in the destruction
of the nuclear weapons;
<LI>assess the completeness and correctness of the information provided by South Africa with
respect to the timing and scope of the nuclear weapons programme, and the development,
manufacture,and subsequent dismantling of the nuclear weapons;
<LI>consult on the arrangements for, and ultimately to witness, actions at the Kalahari test shafts
to render them useless;
<LI>visit facilities previously involved in or associated with the nuclear weapons programme and
to confirm that they are no longer being used for such purposes;
<LI>consult on future strategies for maintaining assurance that the nuclear weapons capability
would not be regenerated.
</UL>
These objectives were based on the IAEA's rights and obligations under the safeguards agreement
and on the stated policy of the South African Government for full transparency with respect to
the country's former nuclear weapons programme. The IAEA team had extensive discussions
with the South African authorities and technical staff at the AEC and at the State-owned
armaments corporation (ARMSCOR) which had been responsible for the production phase of the
nuclear weapons programme. Detailed briefings were provided on the various phases of the
programme and on the associated development and production facilities. Information on the future
development of the programme, which had been envisaged before the order to dismantle the
nuclear weapons programme intervened, was also provided.
<P>
Information from IAEA Member States was used to confirm that all relevant facilities/locations
had been inspected.
<P>
On the basis of official documents, programme records, and information obtained through
interviews with principal personnel at the various facilities and locations involved in the
programme, the IAEA team was able to document the timing and scope of the nuclear weapons
programme. 
<P>
In the 10-year period up to 1979, all research and development work on nuclear explosive
devices was done by the South African Atomic Energy Board, the forerunner of the AEC. This
work resulted in the production of a "non-deliverable demonstration device", which was designed
in such a way that, if the need arose, it could be rapidly deployed for an underground test to
demonstrate South Africa's nuclear weapons capability. Its purpose remained that of a
demonstration device throughout the programme; it was never converted to a deliverable device.
<P>
It was in 1979 that the responsibility for the nuclear weapons programme was transferred to
ARMSCOR, while the AEC was made responsible for the production and supply of HEU and
for theoretical studies and some development work in nuclear weapons technology. ARMSCOR's
principal nuclear weapons activities were carried out in the so-called Circle facilities, located
some 15 kilometers away from the AEC's establishment at Pelindaba. The Circle facilities were
constructed during 1980 on the basis of designs provided by the AEC and were commissioned
in May 1981. The nuclear weapons programme thus established involved:
<UL>
<LI> the development and production of a number of deliverable gun-assembled devices;
<LI>lithium-6 separation for the production of tritium for possible future use in boosted devices;
<LI> studies of implosion and thermonuclear technology;
<LI>research and development for the production and recovery of plutonium and tritium.
</UL>
In September 1985, the South African Government decided to limit the scope of the programme
to the production of seven gun-assembled devices, to stop all work related to possible plutonium
devices and to limit the production of lithium-6; however, it allowed further development work
on implosion technology and theoretical work on more advanced devices.
<P>
The first prototype deliverable device had been completed in December 1982, but it was not until
August 1987 that the first qualified production model was completed. The delay was largely due
to the implementation of a rigorous engineering qualification programme directed towards safety
and security under a range of postulated storage, delivery, and accident scenarios. When, in
November 1989, the decision was taken by the Government to stop the production of nuclear
weapons, four further qualified deliverable gun-assembled devices had been completed and the
HEU core and some non-nuclear components for a seventh device had been fabricated. On 26
February 1990, the State President issued a written instruction that, inter alia, all existing nuclear
devices were to be dismantled and the nuclear materials were to be melted down and returned
to the AEC in preparation for South Africa's accession to the NPT.
<P>
By the time of the IAEA team's visit in April 1993, the dismantling and destruction of weapons
components and the destruction of the technical documentation had been nearly completed.
Dismantling records concerning the HEU components of the weapons were available. They
provided sufficient detail to enable the ARMSCOR data to be correlated with the corresponding
data in the nuclear material accountancy records maintained by the AEC.
<P>
The dismantling of the non-nuclear components of the weapons had been carried out in
accordance with procedures approved by the South African authorities. A number of destroyed
or partially destroyed components had been retained and were shown to some members of the
team in April 1993. Remaining records, in the form of "build history" logbooks for the completed
weapons and the experimental devices, were examined and compared with the dismantling
listings. Identification numbers of remaining components were compared and found to be
consistent with those shown in the records.
<P>
The team carried out an audit of the records of the transfer of enriched uranium between the
AEC and ARMSCOR/Circle. As a result of this audit, the team concluded that the enriched
uranium originally supplied to ARMSCOR/Circle had been returned to the AEC and was subject
to IAEA safeguards at the time the safeguards agreement entered into force. 
<P>
The team visited all facilities identified as having connection with the former nuclear weapons
programme. It is appropriate to record the active co-operation of the South African authorities
in arranging for access to all facilities that the team requested to visit -- both those facilities
which had been provisionally listed by the South African authorities as having direct connection
with the former nuclear weapons programme, or with peripheral activities, and additional
facilities identified by the team. The IAEA is not in possession of any information suggesting
the existence of any undeclared facilities connected with the programme.
<P>
Actions were taken by ARMSCOR to render useless the test shafts at the Vastrap (Kalahari) site,
in accordance with a plan incorporating specific suggestions made by the IAEA team. Although
the implementation of this plan met with some initial practical difficulties, the measures to render
the test shafts useless were successfully completed in July 1993 and were witnessed by IAEA
safeguards inspectors.
<P>
The equipment used for uranium metallurgy at ARMSCOR/Circle had been returned to the AEC
at the end of the programme. The whole uranium metallurgy process area at ARMSCOR/Circle
had been dismantled and decontaminated. The machine tools used for manufacturing the HEU
and high explosives components had been decontaminated and are now available for commercial
non-nuclear applications. The South African authorities stated that specialized equipment
supporting the weapons systems in the form of computerized testing equipment has been rendered
useless through the destruction of the specific software.
<P>
<H3>General conclusions</H3>
Based on the IAEA's extensive verification activities in South Africa, a number of general
conclusions have been made.
It was determined that the magnitude of the  apparent discrepancy  in the uranium-235 balance
associated with the Y-plant was such that -- having regard to the normal uncertainties expected
to be involved in the plant historical operating and accounting records -- it was reasonable to
conclude that the uranium-235 balance of the HEU, LEU, and depleted uranium produced by the
pilot enrichment plant was consistent with the uranium feed. Assessment of the production
capacity of the pilot enrichment plant, on the basis of operating records and supporting technical
data provided to the IAEA team by the AEC, indicated that it was reasonable to conclude that
the amounts of HEU which could have been produced by the plant were consistent with the
amounts declared in the initial report.
<P>
The IAEA team's audit of the associated records indicated that all of the HEU provided by the
AEC to the nuclear weapons programme had been returned to the AEC and was subject to IAEA
safeguards at the time the safeguards agreement entered into force.
<P>
The findings from the team's examination of records, facilities, and remaining non-nuclear
components of the dismantled/destroyed nuclear weapons, and from the team's evaluation of the
amount of HEU produced by the pilot enrichment plant, showed consistency with the declared
scope of the nuclear weapons programme.
<P>
The team found no indication to suggest that there remained any sensitive components of the
nuclear weapons programme which had not been either rendered useless or converted to
commercial non-nuclear applications or peaceful nuclear usage.
<P>
Also, for the Z-plant, it was possible on the basis of the team's examination of the operational
records, sampling, and analyzing of UF6 from certain tail containers and the correction of minor
other errors in the initial inventory to conclude that the amounts of LEU reported as produced
by the plant was consistent with the documented operation of the plant.
<P>
These general conclusions had strong technical bases and were significantly supported by the
transparency and openness of the South African authorities with respect to access to information
and locations, in particular the stated and demonstrated willingness of the authorities to facilitate
access to any location that the IAEA may identify.
<P>
The IAEA's assessment of the completeness of South Africa's inventory of nuclear facilities and
materials and its assessment of the status of the former nuclear weapons programme -- as in all
cases where a large nuclear programme comes under safeguards -- is not free from uncertainty.
<P>
In the case of South Africa, the results of extensive inspection and assessment, and the
transparency and openness shown, have led to the conclusion that there were no indications to
suggest that the initial inventory is incomplete or that the nuclear weapon programme was not
completely terminated and dismantled. However, in the future, and without prejudice to the
IAEA's rights under the safeguards agreement, the IAEA plans to take up the standing invitation
of the South African Government -- under its reiterated policy of transparency -- to provide the
IAEA with full access to any location or facility associated with the former nuclear weapons
programme and to grant access, on a case-by-case basis, to other locations or facilities that the
IAEA may specifically wish to visit.

<H2>US fissile material initiatives:  Implications for the IAEA</H2>
<P>
<I>Under two US initiatives, the IAEA would play a greater role in
safeguarding fissile material that can be used for nuclear weapons</I>
<P>
<B>by Fred McGoldrick</B>
<HR>
<P>
In a comprehensive statement of United States non-proliferation policy on 27 September 1993, President Clinton proposed a number of major new initiatives to help strengthen US policy and practice in this area of vital importance to US and global security and, more generally, to help reinforce the international nuclear non-proliferation regime.  Some of these initiatives can and will be carried out by the United States acting on its own.  Others must be a common effort by the United States and other countries if we are to build a more secure future for all humankind.  Many of the proposed initiatives have important implications for the IAEA, and especially for its crucial role in applying international safeguards.
<P>
Key among the initiatives proposed by President Clinton are several designed to mitigate the continuing threat posed by weapons-usable fissile material. This article focuses on two initiatives in particular:  US policy to deal with existing stockpiles of fissile materials including its intention to submit fissile material excess to US defense needs to IAEA safeguards, and the proposed global treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosives.
<P>
<H3>Submitting excess fissile material from US weapons to safeguards</H3>
<P>
The United States has begun a process of submitting US fissile material no longer needed for the US deterrent or other defense purposes to inspection by the IAEA.  As a nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the United States is not obligated to place its nuclear activities under IAEA safeguards.  However, in 1980 the US concluded a safeguards agreement with the IAEA which makes eligible for safeguards all source and fissionable materials in all its nuclear facilities except only those facilities associated with activities of direct national security significance.  Historically, the IAEA has typically selected for safeguarding one to three of the some 230 nuclear facilities that the US has made eligible for inspections.  It is the US intent to place excess highly- enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium from the US defense program under this US-IAEA voluntary safeguards agreement. 
<P>
The Nuclear Weapons Council - an inter-agency US body charged with the responsibility of determining how much nuclear material is necessary to meet defense requirements - has made some initial decisions on what nuclear materials are excess and therefore eligible for safeguards.  This will be a continuing process, and it is impossible to predict at this stage how long it will take.
<P>
Nuclear materials excess to defense requirements are located in a variety of facilities, some of which maintain a national security mission.  Excess materials will need to be segregated from nuclear materials retained for defense purposes in order to permit IAEA inspection.  They will also be in a variety of different forms including residues, spent fuel, HEU in metal form, and plutonium in oxide and metallic forms.  Much of the material resulting from the dismantlement of nuclear weapons will be in the form of nuclear weapons components since the US presently has no facilities for converting such components into less sensitive forms.
<P>
The US is proceeding in a step-by-step fashion.  As a first step in September 1994, the United States placed approximately 10 tonnes in non-sensitive forms of HEU located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the eligible list of the US-IAEA safeguards agreement.  The IAEA conducted its initial inspection the same month.  The United States informed the Agency that it would not remove such material from safeguards for nuclear explosive purposes.
<P>
The US has submitted several tonnes of plutonium in oxide and metallic form located in Hanford, Washington, and expects to submit additional quantities of plutonium at Rocky Falls, Colorado in the near future.
<P>
Submitting nuclear weapon components to IAEA safeguards will pose particularly challenging and as yet unresolved issues.  If nuclear weapons components are to be inspected by the IAEA, the US and the IAEA must devise an inspection approach which will provide the IAEA with the opportunity for credible verification of the nuclear material concerned while at the same time protecting sensitive nuclear weapons design information. 
<P> 
The US is conducting two major reviews to address the issue of component inspection.  In the first study, we are examining potential inspection and measurement alternatives to those involved in standard IAEA practices.  Such approaches include verification of non-sensitive characteristics of weapons components, or confirmation of sensitive information without such information being revealed to inspectors.  At the same time, a study is under way to examine whether revealing certain information about nuclear weapons components, such as mass, would involve serious proliferation risks.
<P>
The results of these studies will be closely co-ordinated to identify inspection options that result in a high level of verification while minimizing proliferation risk.  The US intends to work closely with the IAEA in assessing the inspection options and in designing procedures which will provide a high degree of assurance to the international community that material removed from nuclear weapons and declared excess will not be returned to such use.
<P>
<B>US-Russian joint summit statement.</B>  In addition to this unilateral step, President Clinton and President Yeltsin issued a joint summit statement on non-proliferation on 14 January 1994, in which
<P>
"They agreed among other things to establish a joint working group to consider steps to ensure the transparency and irreversibility of the process of reduction of nuclear weapons, including the possibility of putting a portion of fissionable material under IAEA safeguards.  Particular attention would be given to materials released in the process of nuclear disarmament and steps to ensure that these materials would not be used again for nuclear weapons."
<P>
They also agreed to consider including in their voluntary safeguards offers with the IAEA all sources and special fissionable materials excluding only those associated with activities having direct national security significance.  
<P> 
In furtherance of the Presidents' statement, the US Department of Energy announced on 16 March 1994 their intention to host reciprocal inspections to facilities containing plutonium removed from nuclear weapons.  The US and Russian sides also registered their intention to conclude an agreement on the means of confirming the plutonium and HEU inventories from nuclear disarmament.  They also noted that these inspections would be an important step in the process of establishing a worldwide control regime for fissile materials.
<P>
The United States and Russia have established two working groups to address fissile material issues.  One in a working group on safeguards, transparency, and irreversibility (STI) which is examining specific measures to improve confidence in and increase the transparency and irreversibility of the process of reducing nuclear weapons.  At their September 1994 summit meeting, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin agreed that their two governments should also work together to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>co-operate on a bilateral and multilateral basis, including through the exchange of appropriate information, to prevent illegal trade in nuclear materials and undertake measures to strengthen the regime of control and physical protection of such materials;
<LI>exchange detailed information at the next meeting of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission on aggregate stockpiles of fissile materials, and on their safety and security;
<LI>direct their joint working group on STI to pursue by March 1995 further measures to improve confidence in and increase the transparency and irreversibility of the process of reducing nuclear weapons;
<LI>facilitate broad co-operation among appropriate agencies in both countries to ensure effective control, accounting and physical protection of nuclear materials;
<LI>facilitate co-operative programmes between US and Russian national laboratories in the areas of safety, physical protection, control and accounting of nuclear materials;
</UL>
<P>
The US and Russian steps noted above can have only a salutary impact on arms control, non- proliferation, and international and regional peace and security.  Some of these initiatives could also have a major impact on the IAEA as they will be the first cases in which the IAEA will play a role in verifying certain aspects of the disarmament process.   Over time they will also have an important effect on the costs of IAEA safeguards.  Some argue that the benefits of safeguards in nuclear-weapon States are not commensurate with the costs.  Such safeguards are in the security interests of all States. We must therefore find the resources for the application of safeguards to nuclear materials excess to defense needs.
<P>
<H3>Proposed treaty on the cut-off of production of fissile material</H3>
<P>
In his non-proliferation statement of 27 September 1993, President Clinton also called for an international treaty prohibiting the production of highly enriched uranium and the separation of plutonium for nuclear explosives or outside international safeguards.
<P>
In December 1993, the United Nations General Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.  This resolution, inter alia, 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>expresses the conviction of the international community that a nondiscriminatory, multi- lateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices would be a significant contribution to nuclear non-proliferation in all its respects;
<LI>recommends the negotiation of such a treaty in the most appropriate international forum;
<LI>requests the IAEA to provide assistance for examination of verification arrangements for such a treaty as required; and
<LI>calls upon all States to demonstrate their commitment to the objectives of such a treaty.
</UL>
<P>
The United States attaches great importance to the proposed treaty, and envisages a key role for the IAEA in verifying the commitments made pursuant to it.  The purpose of such a treaty is to strengthen international nuclear non-proliferation norms generally, and to give constraints on weapons-usable nuclear material the additional weight of a binding international commitment. The United States believes the main undertakings of such a convention should include commitments to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>refrain form producing fissile materials for use in nuclear explosive devices;
<LI>refrain from assisting other States to produce fissile materials for proscribed purposes; and
<LI>accept IAEA safeguards to verify the undertaking not to produce fissile materials for purposes proscribed by the treaty.
</UL>
<P>
The United States believes that the treaty should be open to universal membership, and should be non-discriminatory in its provisions.  The United States does not envisage the treaty as prohibiting the production of HEU or the separation of plutonium for civil nuclear activities under safeguards. Nor does the US see the convention as requiring full-scope safeguards.  It would, however, have the important effect of imposing a "cap" on the fissile material available to the treaty's members - both nuclear weapon States and non-nuclear weapon States - for nuclear explosives.
<P>
It is particularly important that the ban on HEU production and plutonium separation for nuclear explosives be credibly verified.  The United States see the IAEA as the appropriate agency to carry out this role.  The safeguards measures themselves should be nondiscriminatory and applied in a similar manner in all States party to the treaty.
<P>
The verification of the basic obligations of the cut-off treaty raises a number of significant safeguards issues.  A key question is what facilities and materials would be subject to safeguards under the treaty.  There are various possibilities.
<P>
One option would apply safeguards to all reprocessing and enrichment facilities in States party to the treaty as well as the plutonium and HEU products of these plants.  One question is how far through the fuel cycle safeguards should follow the HEU and plutonium.  In order to provide credible verification of the basic undertaking of the treaty, safeguards would have to apply to these materials at least up to the point of their irradiation in a reactor.  Safeguards would, of course, apply to any reprocessing of the spent fuel.
<P>
A second option would be a more extensive one in which safeguards would apply to all nuclear materials in a State party to the cut-off treaty except the unsafeguarded special fissionable materials produced prior to entry into force of the treaty.  This would not be full- scope safeguards but would provide a greater level of assurance of the undertakings of the cut-off than would the first option.  It would, however, raise the cost of verification.
<P>
A third approach would be a phased one which would start with the first option described above and move over time to a more extensive option.  The broadening of safeguards coverage could take place according to a predetermined schedule, or the parties to the treaty could meet periodically to take a decision on whether and to what extent safeguards coverage should be expanded under the treaty.
<P>
It is possible to consider certain transparency measures to supplement classical safeguards.  For example, State Parties could declare the location of all nuclear activities in their territories, whether civil or military. Depending on which safeguards option is selected and on the sensitivity of the activity, these declarations could range from a simple declaration of the location and purpose of facilities to detailed reporting on the nature of the activities and the quantities of nuclear material.  Such transparency measures would, of course, be a complement to, not a substitute for, IAEA safeguards.
<P>
Clearly, States will have to weigh options such as these (and perhaps other) very carefully.  Each has profound implications for the IAEA's safeguards system, as well as for the resources required, not only for the IAEA but for the States and operators being inspected.
<P>
Adequate verification of this treaty will require the IAEA to have the right to carry out its safeguards responsibilities to ensure against undeclared activities prohibited by the treaty.  Special or challenge inspections under a cut-off treaty raise certain questions since Sates will have sensitive facilities on their territories.  Perhaps some form of managed accessibility along the lines of that found in the Chemical Weapons Convention or other approaches should be examined for their applicability to the cut-off treaty.
<P>
Several important technical safeguards questions will also arise under a cut-off treaty.  The treaty, as we envisage it, will prohibit the production of HEU, plutonium, and uranium-233 for nuclear explosives.  It would not, however, prevent the production of tritium or the use  of HEU for nonexplosive military uses such as naval reactors.  In the case of tritium production, if safeguards were applied to HEU fuel in a reactor, inspections would have to be carried out without exposing information which States regard as classified.
<P>
The IAEA may also be called upon to safeguard old reprocessing facilities which were built to separate weapons grade plutonium for nuclear weapons programmes and were never designed to facilitate the application of safeguards.  This will place significant demands on the Agency's ingenuity and resources.  The IAEA will also take on some new tasks such as verifying that certain enrichment and reprocessing plants are shut down, and perhaps safeguarding enrichment facilities which are producing HEU.  These challenges will require the development of new safeguards approaches.
<P>
Another important issue arising from the proposed cut-off treaty is what sort of legal instrument should be used to define the Agency's safeguards rights and obligations in verifying the undertakings of the cut-off treaty.  In considering this question we must keep two facts in mind.  First, the parties to this treaty will be nuclear weapon States, non-nuclear weapon States which have full-scope safeguards agreements; and non-nuclear weapon States which have certain unsafeguarded nuclear activities.  Second, whatever the legal form or forms of the safeguards arrangements chosen, the verification of the treaty's undertakings must be nondiscriminatory in its effect.  The safeguards obligations of nuclear weapon States, NPT parties, and States without a full-scope safeguards agreement must be the same under the treaty.
<P>
The United States does not expect that a cut-off treaty and its associated safeguards arrangements will be concluded over night.  Many issues need to be thoroughly vetted and resolved not only with respect to the safeguards aspects of the treaty but also a number of other treaty-related issues.  Nevertheless, the US strongly favors moving forward in negotiating this treaty as expeditiously as possible.
<P>
The United States and Russia have already taken steps in advance of the cut-off treaty to cease production of fissile materials.  Both countries have ceased the production of HEU for nuclear weapons.  In addition, in June 1994, US Vice President Gore and Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin signed an agreement providing for the shutdown of plutonium production reactors and the cessation of the use of newly produced plutonium for nuclear weapons.  Under this agreement all plutonium production reactors in both counties will cease operation no later than the year 2000.  The US has ceased production of plutonium for nuclear weapons and has already shut down its production reactors, and under this agreement the Russians have pledged to cease operation of their three remaining production reactors at Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk.  The US and Russia are now studying ways to develop replacement sources of heat and electricity to enable the Russian reactors to shut down on schedule.  In addition, the two sides are developing procedures necessary to ensure that plutonium produced by these production reactors before shutdown will not be used in nuclear weapons.  The parties also agreed to strive to reach agreement on the earliest possible total cessation of the production of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons.  
<P>
We hope that all States producing unsafeguarded fissile material could take similar positive steps in advance of the conclusion of a cut-off treaty.
<P>
There is little doubt that a cut-off treaty, once in effect will have profound impact on the IAEA's safeguards responsibilities.  It will greatly increase its inspection activities and could result in a significant increase in the resources required for the safeguards function of the IAEA.  Most importantly, it will greatly expand the Agency's contribution to an effective international non-proliferation regime.

<H2>Nuclear techniques for food and agricultural development: 1964-94</H2>
<I>A look at selected achievements of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division as it marked its 30th year of worldwide service in October 1994</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF="#note1">by Bj&ouml;rn Sigurbj&ouml;rnsson and Peter Vose</A></B>
<HR>
From research laboratories to farmers' fields, nuclear techniques play an increasingly valuable and often unique role in agricultural research and development. They are used in a wide range of applications, from food preservation to crop production to animal health studies.
<P>
In no small measure, the collaborative work of two global organizations -- the IAEA and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations -- has been instrumental to the progress. Thirty years ago, in October 1964, the two agencies combined forces to form a Joint Division for Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture. The new division unified FAO's atomic energy branch and IAEA's agricultural unit, and in the process created a common programme that avoided overlap and duplication of efforts.
<P> 
Over the past 30 years, programmes of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division have helped countries solve practical, and costly, problems in areas of soil fertility, irrigation, and crop production; plant breeding and genetics; animal production and health; insect and pest control; agrochemicals and residues; and food preservation. The Division's overall objectives are to exploit the potential for application of isotopes and radiation techniques in agricultural research and development; to increase and stabilize agricultural production; to reduce production costs; to improve the quality of food; to protect agricultural products from spoilage and losses; and to minimize pollution of food and the agricultural environment. On the occasion of the Joint Division's 30th anniversary year, this article highlights selected achievements over the past three decades.<A HREF="#note2">*</A>
<P>
<B> Soil fertility and nitrogen fixation</B>
<P>
Agricultural researchers have long suspected that a great deal of fertilizer is wasted by being wrongly applied and consequently never gets taken up by the crop. The problem drew the attention of experts of the Joint Division in the 1960s, but they realized that possible solutions could be expensive. The Division's first co-ordinated research programmes on rice and maize,  however, demonstrated that the use of the isotopes phosphorus-32 and nitrogen-15 in worldwide field studies was economicallyfeasible. The finding stimulated the widespread use of nitrogen-15 in agricultural research, and had a major influence on extending the use of isotope techniques to many developing countries.
In subsequent years, FAO/IAEA-sponsored experiments on rice fertilization in the Far East, Hungary, and Egypt helped solve critical problems concerning the proper placement of phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizers. It was found that phosphorus should be given on the surface, whereas that would be the worst possible circumstance for nitrogen, whose surface applications would not be taken up by the crop. While this had been suspected from years of traditional experimentation, it had not been proven before.
<P>
A co-ordinated programme with maize further showed that the uptake of phosphorus was increased when it was mixed with nitrogen fertilizer, and that application of some nitrogen at the time of tasselling resulted in very effective uptake and increased crop yield. Recommendations based on these experimental results have been adopted by the FAO fertilizer programme, as well as by many countries, thus helping to save millions of dollars in fertilizer costs.
<P>
Similarly, for tree crops, the Joint Division's work showed that effective placement of fertilizer can offer savings over many years. While traditional fertilizer experiments with tree crops take years to perform and evaluate, the use of fertilizers labelled with isotopes can help researchers determine root activity. The Division's programme showed that traditional placement of fertilizers was not optimal in many cases.
<P>
More recently, research has been intensive on the subject of biological nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere. The work has been prompted by the high costs and often poor availability ofnitrogen fertilizers in developing countries, plus the need to reduce fertilizer levels in developed countries. It is quite difficult to measure the amount of  nitrogen fixed by a crop, but the Joint FAO/IAEA Division has been among thepioneers in the development of methods using nitrogen-15. These methods give good results and have been used in major co-ordinated research programmes determining the nitrogen fixing capacity of beans and other legumes, of pastures, of nitrogen-fixing leguminous trees, and of  <I>Azolla </I>, the pond weed that supplies nitrogen to rice paddies.
<P> 
<B>Soil moisture and irrigation</B>
<P>
The efficient use of water in irrigation systems requires continuous monitoring of the level of soil moisture and interpretation of these measurements. The use of nuclear techniques to measure soil moisture has enabled soil physicists to redesign irrigation regimes and better plan the use of scarce irrigation water. At the same time, the productive potential of the land can be maintained or improved.
FAO/IAEA co-ordinated research program mes have shown that traditional irrigation methodscan be improved to save as much as 40% of total water use; the saved water can be  used to irrigate other areas. Researchers in a number of countries have tested different practices to increase water conservation in rainfed areas, with results leading to immediate practical applications.
<P>
<B> Mutation plant breeding </B>
<P>
In 1964, mutation breeding was frequently  derided. Long-established plant breeders had difficulty in believing that inducing mutants through radiation in an apparently random manner had any relevance to their classical procedures, with careful crossing of different parent plants and selection and re-selection of their progeny. But attitudes have  greatly changed, in great part due to the Joint Division's programmes. In reality, mutation breeding has been one of the big success stories --1800 improved mutant cultivars released to date-- with an impact so great that we don't attempt to assess its monetary value.
A turning point was probably an international conference sponsored by the FAO and IAEA  in Rome in the Spring of 1964. At that time, the number of known released mutant cultivars was less than fifty. At the conference, it was agreed that co-operative work was needed to solve problems in effective mutation treatment conditions, and in the subsequent screening, selection, and application of mutants, among other areas.
<P>
There was a serious lack of knowledge about how to start a mutation breeding programme and how to incorporate a useful trait into the best  existing varieties. This challenge was taken up by the new Division. The FAO/IAEA  <I>Manual on Mutation Breeding  </I> was the answer. This publication has had enormous influence, becoming a standard text for plant breeders. On the practical  side, a very significant development was the design of a facility (SNIF--Standard Neutron Irradiation Facility)  to provide plant breeders with a pure source of fast neutrons in pool-type reactors.
<P>
An early FAO/IAEA programme was concerned with testing mutant durum wheat cultivars in the Mediterranean and Near East. Mutant cultivars of durum wheat are now among some of the most successful grown, with almost 70% of the total acreage of durum in Italy under mutant varieties.
<P>
Pioneer mutation breeding also was done on barley, leading to a situation today where virtually all barley cultivars grown in northern and central Europe have induced mutations in their parentage, coming about through a "cascade"  process of newer varieties.
Mutation breeding in rice has been extremely successful. Largely as a result of the 1964 conference, a major co-ordinated rice improvement programme using mutation techniques was developed under FAO/IAEA auspices. The result was a high number of improved new varieties bred with the help of induced mutations. Before the programme began, there were four released mutant cultivars of rice. Today there are more than 200. Worldwide, there are many millions of hectares under mutant rice cultivars and the impact has been enormous.
<P>
The Joint Division has addressed other problems as well, such as crop resistance to diseases and the protein content of cereal grains. From studies of the annual cereals like barley, wheat, and rice, research moved to grain legumes, fruits, and root and tuber crops. The programmes on grain legume improvement resulted in more than 100 improved cultivars. 
Vegetatively propagated crops presented much greater problems -- except for the multi-million dollar house plant market, which needed no help as mutants were very easily obtained. The answer seems to lie in the use of <I>in vitro</I> culture techniques, and the Joint Division -- through its Agriculture Laboratory at the IAEA's Seibersdorf Laboratories -- has been active in exploring unconventional breeding methods for improvement of tropical crops. Palms, tropical fruits, cassava, yam, and cocoa have been among the crops studied. For example, cultures of banana tissues significantly enhance the effective use of mutation treatments. Cultivars of bananas aimed at acquiring disease resistance are being tested. One of these, called "Novaria" and  developed at Seibersdorf, has just been released in Malaysia.
<P>
<B> Animal production and health</B>
<P> 
Livestock are an important component of  most farming systems. Internal parasites result  in huge losses of animals worldwide, shown both through reduced growth and from needless deaths. Quite early research showed that some internal animal parasites could be "attenuated"  by irradiation -- that is made harmless -- to provide vaccines against a number of killing parasitic diseases. The earliest FAO/IAEA co-ordinated programme in animal sciences in 1966 was devoted to the effective control of internal parasites in domestic animals.
<P>
The reproduction of animals has been another focus of research. The reproductive status of female animals can be determined by measuring the level of the hormone progesterone in their blood or milk using radioimmunoassay (RIA) with iodine-125 as a label. The Seibersdorf Laboratory has developed RIA kits especially designed for use under difficult conditions. Using this method, very successful FAO/IAEA programmes on buffalo production in Asia, sheep and goats in Africa, and llamas and alpacas in Latin America have given unique information on the reproductive behaviour of indigenous species and the types of livestock raised by typical small farmers. They have led to the identification of animals with superior performance, and the acceptance of new management practices to improve breeding efficiency.
<P>
DNA probes that are isotopically labelled (using phosphorus-32 or iodine-131), and immunoassay methods that are similar in principle, enable diagnosis of diseases, assist in conducting disease surveys, and monitor disease control programmes. The immunoassay test (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay-- ELISA) is used to detect and measure antibodies to particular infections. It therefore can be used to establish the extent of major diseases, such as rinderpest (the cattle plague), babesiosis and brucellosis. Moreover, it can monitor the effectiveness of control measures such as drug treatment or vaccination.
ELISA has been highly successful. Kits especially designed at the Seibersdorf Laboratory have been supplied worldwide, with many millions of assay units sent out to different projects. A major use of ELISA has been  in the rinderpest vaccination campaign in Nigeria, and, more recently, in the Pan African Rinderpest Campaign, which cleared rinderpest from 14 countries.
<P> 
Problems of nutrition also continue to command attention. Mineral deficiency or imbalance is often a problem in livestock, but frequently it is not easy to recognize that a problem exists until growth of the animals is seriously affected. Isotope methods for diagnosing copper, selenium, zinc, and phosphorus deficiency have provided a quicker way of determining the status of these essential elements, and were a feature of early FAO/IAEA work.
<P>
One co-ordinated programme used nitrogen-15 in studies of non-protein nitrogen sources, such as urea, as a supplementary feed for ruminants. This led to the use of cheap non-protein nitrogen to meet the protein needs of ruminants, because they can convert the inorganic nitrogen to protein.
<P>
Joint FAO/IAEA work in the 1980s focused on finding the best ways of using fibrous fodders like straw and crop residues, and byproducts of  food processing industries such as bagasse, for feeding buffaloes, sheep, and goats. An artificial   rumen, named Rusitec, was designed and used to study microbial degradation of feeds using isotope labelling. The acquired information has led to the formulation of new diets based on locally available feeds for ruminant animals in developing countries.
<P>
The worldwide scope of these programmes  has contributed substantially to concepts now common among animal nutritionists in establishing the value of feeds and the nutrient requirements of livestock.
<P>
<B> Insect control</B>
<P>
There are major insect pests of crops, livestock, and humans whose impact is so great that the social development and economies of entire regions may be affected. They include the screwworm, which affects humans and warm-blooded animals (principally cattle), the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), and the tsetse fly, which affects both livestock and humans.
<P>
Over the years, the FAO and IAEA have jointly convened eight major symposia on the application of radiation techniques to insect problems. The meetings have particularly influenced development of the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT). This technique involves rearing insects, which are then sterilized by radiation and later released in the infested areas. Their mates  do not produce offspring, and with repeated releases the population is reduced and eradicated.
<P>
The medfly, <I> Ceratitis capitata </I>, is virtually ubiquitous wherever there is citrus and soft fruit  grown. The economic consequences are profound as the fruit is seriously damaged, and consequently exports are greatly reduced. Researchers at the Seibersdorf Laboratories have developed artificial diets and highly successful rearing methods for the medfly, so that mass-rearing of millions of flies can be done cheaply. Though it sounds simple, it took a lot of research to make it so.
<P>
Two especially important developments occurred at Seibersdorf. The first was the creation of a genetic sexing strain of medfly in  which the female pupae are white and the males brown, thus permitting easy separation and enabling the release of only male flies. A further very clever piece of research has involved the insertion of a differential heat-sensitive gene, induced by a chemical mutagen, onto the sex-determining Y-chromosome, by means of a radiation induced chromosome translocation; a technical "tour de force". The resulting medfly strain permits sex segregation at an earlier  "stage -- the eggs are heated to 35<SUP>o</SUP> C, whereupon eggs carrying females are killed, while the males survive. This means that it is necessary to rear only half the larvae, thus halving food costs, a major expense of the SIT method. Moreover, releasing only males means that fruit is not punctured by females laying sterile eggs.
<P>
One of the big medfly success stories has  been the eradication campaign in Mexico, for which the Joint FAO/IAEA Divison provided  advice, training, and assistance in designing the eradication project and the fly "factory". In the end, a massive programme funded by Mexico and the United States could produce 500 million sterile flies per week. As a result the pest was eradicated from the infested area, and an enormous loss to the Mexican economy was prevented.
<P>
The New World Screwworm is a pernicious, unpleasant pest of all warm-blooded animals. Eggs are laid on the backs of animals and the resulting larvae bore through the hide into the flesh. In 1988, it was found that the insect had established itself in Libya, and an urgent national and international effort, co-ordinated by FAO and supported by IAEA, was mounted to prevent  its spread to livestock and wildlife in North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and the Mediterranean Basin. By 1992, eradication was achieved, preventing the enormous losses which would have occurred if the infestation had been allowed to spread. 
Tsetse flies,<I> Glossina spp.,</I>  effectively "sterilize" almost two-thirds of the land area of sub-Saharan Africa. The tsetse fly feeds on the blood of animals and transmits the Trypanosomas organism which is responsible for human sleeping sickness and the "Ngana" condition in cattle. About 50 million people are at risk in an area the size of the entire farmland of the United States.
<P>
Researchers at the Seibersdorf Laboratories have worked steadily towards making SIT a reality for tsetse, including development of methods of rearing on artificial membranes with a blood diet. At the start, it was not known if self-sustaining colonies could be kept for a long period in the laboratory, and still have progeny that would later function in the wild. This has now been achieved.
<P>
In Nigeria, an operation known as the BICOT pilot project was carried out by the FAO and IAEA in 1984-86. It successfully eradicated the tsetse fly from an area of 1500 square kilometers. At the present time, a number of pilot scale projects are being run to build upon the experience acquired during that project.
<P>
<B> Agrochemicals and the environment </B>
<P>
Public concern about the potential contamination of food is not new. Prior to 1964, the FAO had collected information on the amount of radioactivity from fallout found in soil, vegetation, and food. The data was reported to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR). In 1969, these results were put into perspective at a seminar on Agricultural and Public Health Aspects of Environmental Contamination by Radioactive Materials jointly sponsored by the FAO, IAEA, and World Health Organization (WHO).
<P>
The Chernobyl accident revived the earlier international concern about the contamination of the environment by radioactive fallout. It led to a major FAO/IAEA report,<I> Radioactive Fallout in Soils, Crops and Food</I> in 1989. This was accompanied the same year by an international symposium on Environmental Effects Following a Major Nuclear Accident, which was convened by the FAO, IAEA, WHO, and United Nations Environment Programme.
<P>
A body of information exists to help evaluate the extent and magnitude of any future environmental contamination from radionuclides. The 1994 publication, <I>Guidelines for Agricultural Countermeasures Following an Accidental Release of Radionuclides</I>, will assist in devising methods of monitoring and limiting the short- and long-term  effects on agriculture, food, and human health.
<P>
Nitrates in drinking water sources have become a political issue as well, as levels are sometimes close to or exceed WHO limits. A Joint FAO/IAEA Division programme in the 1970s used nitrogen-15 tracers to show beyond doubt that the nitrate found in the water table was almost exclusively due to agricultural inputs. The results were disseminated in a series of publications (1974, 1975, 1984) which have become standard references in the field.
<P>
The discharge of mercury waste to rivers and estuaries has caused localized outbreaks of poisoning in consumers of fish. Additionally, the use of organo-mercury compounds in agriculture as a seed dressing against seed-borne fungal diseases has caused the death of many birds and accidents to people. In collaboration with WHO and the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Joint FAO/IAEA Division has evaluated the impact of mercury on the environment. A monograph was issued which became a major source of information, and subsequently resulted in heavy restrictions on the use and release of mercury.
<P>
In the field of pesticides, radioisotope labelling has not only provided exceptionally accurate analysis of minute amounts (parts per billion) of pesticide residues, but has also provided the means to determine metabolic pathways, and the fate of the compounds in nature. Moreover, a considerable fraction of a pesticide-derived residue in soils and plant products cannot be extracted by conventional analytical solvents, and would therefore not be detected except by radioisotope labelling.
<P>
The fate of residues is a determining factor in deciding how a pesticide should be used, or on banning certain compounds as being ecologically harmful, or even determining that a compound that may be potentially harmful in one situation may be quite suitable for use in another.
<P>
For example, the use of DDT and lindane has been widely cut back or banned in temperate climates because of their persistence in the environment. A wide reaching study initiated by the Joint FAO/IAEA Division found that substances such as DDT and lindane dissipated much faster in tropical environments with high temperature and high humidity, so that local accumulation of residues was prevented.
<P>
One current approach of the Joint Division to a more environmentally friendly and efficient  use of herbicides and pesticides is to make them available to the crop over a longer period, but in  lesser concentration, by means of so-called controlled release compounds. These last for a longer time and release the active pesticide or herbicide over a longer period. Radioisotope tracers are invaluable in the research, development, and testing of such formulations.
<P>
<B>Food preservation by irradiation </B>
<P>
As much as one-third of the total world harvest may be lost due to spoilage and infestation on its way to the consumer. Food irradiation  offers a safe and reliable way to reduce wastage. Decades of research have shown conclusively  that there are no adverse effects from the consumption of irradiated foods. They do not become radioactive in any way nor does irradiation leave any harmful residues.
<P> 
Food irradiation is valuable for disinfestation of stored products, such as grain, spices, dried fruit and vegetables; for the sprout inhibition of long-stored potatoes and onions, thus reducing the need for chemical inhibitors of doubtful safety; for the elimination of food-borne diseases, especially  <I>Salmonella </I> in poultry, red meat,  and seafood; for the disinf/1estation of tropical  fruits from the fruit fly and other pests, for which it is an effective residue-free treatment; and for the extension of the shelf life of mushrooms, strawberries, and tropical fruits.
<P>
The FAO/IAEA Symposium on Food Irradiation at Karlsruhe in 1966 was a landmark in defining the possibilities of the technology.  Nevertheless, from the strictly economic point  of view, preserving food by irradiation has so far made only modest impact, despite its advantages. However, the development of enabling technology and legislation has made considerable progress during the last 30 years, and the  work of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division has been largely responsible for this.
<P>
Despite economic handicaps and the resistance of some consumer groups, the number of facilities for food irradiation has steadily grown, and there are now about 65 facilities worldwide, of which about 50 might be called commercial.
<P> 
During the period 1971-81, the FAO, IAEA, and WHO appointed groups of experts to evaluate the studies of the wholesomeness of irradiated foods. As a result of the stimulation and co-ordination of the Joint Division, it became possible in 1983 for the Codex Alimentarius Commission to adopt and publish an international standard for food irradiation.
<P> 
At present, an International Consultative Group on Food Irradiation (ICGFI) operates under the aegis of the FAO, IAEA and WHO, with the FAO/IAEA acting as its Secretariat. It evaluates global developments and provides Member States with advice. Training has always been an integral part of the effort and the first FAO/IAEA course was held in Michigan, in the United States, in 1967 and was the first of its kind. Later, several hundred persons were trained during the 10 years of an international food irradiation project in Wageningen, Netherlands. Today, training is encouraged by ICGFI, which organizes Irradiation Process Control  Schools, where certificates are earned by successfully trained operators. Its curriculum is being endorsed by an increasing number of food control authorities.
<P>
<B> Training and research for development </B>
<P>
Training, and applied research via co-ordinated programmes and the Seibersdorf Laboratory have always been a prominent feature of Joint Division activities. During the past 30 years, there have been 2200 participants in 122 inter-regional training courses. Moreover, 2609 IAEA fellowships have been awarded in agriculture; 380 of the fellows worked directly at Seibersdorf. From the beginning, the Agriculture Laboratory at Seibersdorf has been central to the Joint Division's work and impact. Without it, some of the most successful programmes could hardly have taken place, as it has done pioneer work not done elsewhere. Its role has been to develop methods and test them, to pursue new lines of approach, and to perform the essential backup for the co-ordinated research and other field programmes.
Originally housed in a pre-fabricated building bought for US $5725 000 earned from a contract (how could a building be so cheap?), the agriculture laboratory has grown to a useful, though still too small, size as a wing of the main laboratory.
<P> 
Similarly, the FAO/IAEA training courses at Seibersdorf used to cause great internal strains because of the lack of space. A new training centre has greatly improved conditions for  course participants, fellowship trainees, and the Laboratory staff alike. It has been a fine investment in the future.

<H2>Chernobyl - Ten years after</H2>
<I>Global expers clarify the facts about the 1986 accident and
its effects</I>
<P>
<A HREF="#note_1"><B>by Abel J. Gonz&aacute;lez</B></A>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
On 26 April 1986, a catastrophic explosion at Unit 4 of the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Ukrainian Republic - close
to the point marking the three-way border with the Republics of
Belarus and Russia - sent a very large amount of radioactive
material into the atmosphere. The event was to become one of the
most protracted and controversial themes of the modern
technological era. The Chernobyl accident caused widespread
concern over its radiological consequences, and also focused
attention on nuclear safety generally. The accidents aftermath
evolved together with the unfolding of glasnost and perestroika
in the former USSR and soon became bound up with many
misunderstandings and apprehensions about the radioactive release
and its real or perceived effects. 
<P>
There was initial secrecy and confusion about the accident -
candidly reported in Prof. Leonid Ilyins book, <I>Chernobyl:
Myths and Reality</I>. The people living in the affected areas
learned about the event mainly from hearsay rather than from
authoritative reporting. The first evidence of the accident
outside the USSR resulted from measurements in nordic countries
showing an unexpected increase in environmental radioactivity.
This initial lack of transparency had an impact on public
confidence, and subsequently so did the confusing and at times
contradictory nature of the information released. Perceptions of
the catastrophe ranged from those who believed that Chernobyl had
been one of the worlds worst ever disasters to those who saw it
as a relatively limited health problem despite the tragic
circumstances. 
<P>
A decade later, in April 1996, more than 800 experts from 71
countries and 20 organizations - observed by over 200 -
journalists  met to review the Chernobyl accidents actual and
possible future consequences, and to put these into proper
perspective. They came together at the international conference
on <A
HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/worldatom/thisweek/preview/chernobyl/
"><I>One Decade after Chernobyl: Summing up the Consequences of
the Accident</I></A>, held at the Austria Center in Vienna. The
Chernobyl Conference was a model of international co-operation:
six organizations of the UN family, including the IAEA, and two
important regional agencies were involved in its organization.
<A HREF="boxp6.html#boxp8"><I>(See box)</I></A>. 
<P>
Between the accident in 1986 and this Chernobyl conference, the
IAEA participated in a range of scientific endeavours which
sought to quantify the actual consequences. <A
HREF="boxp6.html"><I>(See boxes)</I></A>.
<P>
The aim of the Chernobyl Conference was to consolidate "an
international consensus on the accident's consequences, to agree
on proven scientific facts, and to clarify information and
prognoses in order to dispel confusion". The results of the
Conference speak for themselves. <I>(See the following article
for <A HREF="hilites.html">Highlights of the Chernobyl
Conference: Summary of
Results</A>)</I>. Some important issues have been summarised here
and
are separately analysed in reports featured in this edition of
the <I>IAEA Bulletin</I>. 
<P>
<B>Radioactive fallout.</B> Although even today there is no
complete consensus on the amount of radioactive material released
by the Chernobyl accident, the best estimates - which are of the
magnitude of 10<SUP>19</SUP> international units of activity,
called <I>becquerels</I> - are illustrative of the catastrophic
nature of the accident. Two chemical elements in the radioactive
plume formed by the materials released dominated the radiological
consequences: iodine and caesium. There is a family of mainly
short-lived radioactive isotopes of iodine: a significant one is
iodine-131, whose activity falls by half every eight days.
Radioiodines were mainly responsible for irradiation of the
thyroid gland of the people living in nearby regions shortly
after the accident. Of the radioactive caesiums, the most
significant is caesium-137, a long-lived nuclide whose activity
falls by half every 30 years. Caesium-137 was transported through
the atmosphere for long distances, deposited variably over vast
areas, mainly in Europe and - to a minor but measurable extent - 
elsewhere over the whole northern hemisphere. The deposited
caesium became the main cause of whole body radiation exposure in
the long term. <A HREF="boxp3.html"><I>(See box)</I></A>. 
<P>
<B>Radiation doses.</B> The release of radioactive material was
expected to have severe direct consequences for people and
ecosystems in and near the Chernobyl plant site. Radiation damage
correlates with the radiation dose incurred by people and biota.
<I>Dose</I> is a quantity related to the amount of radiation
energy absorbed by the mass of biological matter. The dose
incurred by people is expressed in <I>sieverts</I> and, most
commonly, in the submultiple <I>millisieverts</I> - one
millisievert being a thousandth of a sievert (for comparison
purposes, people receive on average an annual dose of 2.4
millisieverts from natural background radiation). Many of the
plant workers and many people who helped to deal with the
accident's aftermath - who were called <I>'liquidators'</I> -  
received high doses, some of thousands of millisieverts, and
suffered clinical radiation syndromes. Twenty-eight people died
as a consequence of their radiation injuries. Over 100,000
members of the public who were evacuated from the contaminated
areas, and also those who remained living in the less affected
regions, received, or are committed to receiving, relatively low
whole body doses: over their lifetimes, these will be comparable
with or lower than doses they would receive in a lifetime from
natural sources of radiation. <I>(See box)</I>. Doses to the
thyroid gland - particularly of children - were a notable
exception and are presumed to have been very high. Another
exception was doses in local ecosystems.  
<P>
<B>Environmental damage.</B> Lethal radiation doses were reached
in some radiosensitive local ecosystems, within a few kilometres
of the accident, notably in coniferous trees and for voles. Doses
fell sharply within a few months and the ecosystems eventually
recovered. No sustained severe impacts on the environment have
been observed so far. <A HREF="boxp4.html"><I>(See box)</I></A>.
A report by M. Dreicer and R. Alexakhin addresses the <A
HREF="dreicer.html">environmental consequences of the
accident</A> in more detail. 
<P>
A by-product of the environmental contamination was the
contamination of foodstuffs produced in the affected areas.
Although for some time after the accident key foodstuffs showed
activity levels exceeding the maximum levels permitted by the
Codex Alimentarius,<A HREF="#note_2">*</A> no food now produced
by collective farms exceeds these levels. Exceptionally, wild
food products - such as mushrooms, berries and game - from
forests in the more affected areas as well as fish from some
European lakes remain above Codex levels. An important aspect in
controlling the contamination of the human habitat was the
<A HREF="richards.html">agricultural countermeasures undertaken
in the affected areas</A>; these are examined by J. Richards and
R. Hance in a related report.
<P>
<B>Health effects.</B> Health effects attributed to the accident
have commanded the most concern on the part of the public,
decision-makers and political authorities, and the Chernobyl
Conference devoted a great deal of time to the topic.
<I>Clinically observed (and individually attributable)
effects</I> were discussed separately from <I>long-term
effects</I> which can only be attributed to radiation after long
studies of a statistical epidemiological nature of large
populations.<A HREF="#note_3">**</A> <A
HREF="boxp10.html"><I>(See box)</I></A>. Among the
latter, <I>thyroid effects</I> is a special case that was treated
separately from other longer term health effects. 
<P>
<I>Clinically observed effects.</I> The number of people who
suffered clinically observed health effects individually
attributable to radiation exposure due to the Chernobyl accident
was relatively modest, given the accidents dimensions. A total of
237 persons, all of them workers dealing with the accident, were
suspected of suffering clinical syndromes of radiation exposure
and were hospitalized, and 134 of them were diagnosed with
<I>acute radiation syndrome</I>. Of these, 28 died of the
consequences of radiation injuries (three other persons died at
the time of the accident: two due to non-radiation blast injuries
and one due to a coronary thrombosis). <I>(See graph)</I>. Some
years after the accident, 14 additional persons in this group
died; however, their deaths were found to be not necessarily
attributable to radiation exposure. A following report in this
edition by Dr. G. Wagemaker et al. describes the <A
HREF="wagemkr.html">clinically observed effects</A> in more
detail. 
<P>
<I>Thyroid effects.</I> The situation in relation to thyroid
effects is serious. Up to the end of 1995, there were more than
800 cases of thyroid cancer reported in children, mainly in
Belarus. <I>(See graph)</I>. Thyroid cancer may be induced by
causes other than radiation, but all these cases seem to be
likely associated with radiation exposure due to the accident.
They represent a dramatic increase in the normal incidence of
this rare type of cancer and the increase seems not to persist
among children born after 1986. Thyroid cancer is usually
non-fatal with early diagnosis, treatment and attention. At the
time of the Chernobyl Conference, three of the affected children
had already died. The prospects cannot be precisely predicted:
the high incidence is expected to continue for some time and the
number of reported cases may be in the thousands; the mortality
will depend very much on the quality and intensity of the
treatment given to the affected children. Prof. E.D. Williams et
al. reviewed the <A HREF="williams.html">thyroid effects</A> in a
separate report.
<P>
<I>Longer term health effects.</I> There is no evidence to date
of any increase in the incidence of any malignancies other than
thyroid carcinoma or of any hereditary effects attributable to
radiation exposure caused by the Chernobyl accident. This
conclusion, surprising for some observers, is in accordance with
the relatively small whole body doses incurred by the populations
exposed to the radioactive material released. The lifetime doses
expected to be incurred by these populations are also small. In
fact, the risks of radiation induced malignancies and hereditary
effects are extremely small at low radiation doses and, as the
normal incidences of these effects in people are relatively high,
it is not surprising that no effects could be detected. <I>(See
box)</I>. 
<P>
An exception to the lack of evidence of long-term effects might
have occurred in the group of liquidators: taking into account
the relatively high doses reported in this group, an increase in
the incidence of leukaemia might have been detected. For all
other malignancies and hereditary effects, the theoretically
predicted number of cases due to radiation exposure from the
accident are so small in comparison with the background incidence
as to be impossible to confirm statistically.  
<P>
The reason why the theoretically expected increase in the
incidence of leukaemia in the liquidators has not become evident
requires further investigation. It could be that the dose was
lower than reported, or that the epidemiological studies of this
group are somehow inadequate. Less plausibly, the risk factors
for radiation induced leukaemia could be lower than the currently
estimated cases of leukaemia in the 200,000 registered
liquidators who worked in 1986-87, which was of the order of 200
over a lifetime as compared to a spontaneous number of around
800. <I>(See graph)</I>. Dr. E. Cardis et al. go into greater
detail in their report on the <A HREF="cardis.html">long-term
health effects</A>. 
<P>
A retrospective look at the findings of the International
Chernobyl Project in 1990 in relation to <A
HREF="mettler.html">health effects</A> is provided by Dr. Fred
Mettler.
<P>
<B>Social and other impacts.</B> The Chernobyl Conference found
that social, economic, institutional and political impacts were
also important consequences of the Chernobyl accident. A
background paper prepared jointly by officials of Belarus, Russia
and Ukraine described the catastrophe in terms of economic and
social disruption. <A HREF="boxp9.html"><I>(See box)</I></A>.
Large economic losses
attributed to the accident were reported in this official
document and also in the national statements delivered at the
Chernobyl Conference. For the period 1986-91, the total direct
losses and outlays in the former USSR were stated as exceeding
23,000 million roubles. The expenditures were accounted for - 
inter alia - by: losses of capital assets and in production;
population resettlement, including construction of dwellings and
other facilities; forest protection, water conservation, and soil
decontamination and treatment; and, various compensations and
payments of allowances to the population. The President of
Belarus, reported that, "According to our most modest estimates,
the economic damage incurred following the Chernobyl accident is
equal to 32 annual budgets of the Republic, i.e. US $ 235,000
millions. For these purposes we allocate annually 20-25% of the
State budget". The Russian Federation Minister for Civil Defence,
Emergencies and Elimination of Consequences of Natural Disasters
reported that, "Over the past years, trillions of roubles have
been made available for the rehabilitation of the parts of Russia
affected by the accident". For the Ukraine, its Prime Minister
reported that, "The total expenditure in eliminating the
consequences of the accident over the period 1992 to 1996 alone,
paid out of the Ukrainian national budget, exceeds US $ 3,000
millions".  
<P>
Certainly, a major social problem lies in the significant
psychological symptoms detected among the population, such as
anxiety, depression and various psychosomatic disorders
attributable to mental distress. It has been found that it is
extremely difficult to discern whether these effects are
attributable solely to the Chernobyl accident or to economic
hardships and other social problems in the region: the levels of
these disorders in the areas concerned seem to be surprisingly
high whether people were directly affected by the accident or
not. <I>(See graph)</I>. In a separate report, Dr. Britt-Marie
Drottz-Sjoeberg et al. look at <A HREF="sjoberg.html">social and
psychological effects</A> in more detail.
<P>
<B>Nuclear safety issues.</B> For the public as well as for the
responsible authorities, the Chernobyl accident prompts the
question: Are Chernobyl-type reactors now safe? Experts say that
the possibility of a repeat of the accident has virtually been
ruled out because of safety improvements that have been made at
plants of this type. Other safety improvement issues at the
remaining Chernobyl units and reactors of the same RBMK type
require attention. In addition, there is the separate issue of
the safety of the remaining debris at Chernobyl, most of which is
contained within the structure known as the <I>sarcophagus</I>.
All these issues were discussed thoroughly at an international
forum, <I>One Decade After Chernobyl: Nuclear Safety Aspects</I>,
which preceded the Chernobyl Conference and was reported on at
the Conference. <A HREF="boxp13.html"><I>(See box)</I></A>. <A
HREF="lederman.html">More details about the forum and its
conclusions</A> are presented by Mr. L. Lederman in a
following report.
<P>
<B>Outlook.</B> The scientific assessments of the consequences of
the Chernobyl accident have now been discussed and corroborated
ten years later by a wide and representative international
gathering of experts. The results provide the public at large,
decision-makers and political leaders with authoritative
information about these consequences. This ought to put an end to
much of the misinformation that has arisen over the consequences
of the accident. 
<P>
The radiation levels that can still be detected in most affected
areas are sufficiently low as to permit normal economic and
social activity to be resumed. The health effects have not turned
out to be as catastrophic as some feared and others reported. But
a number of radiation effects did occur and more are expected to
occur and should be dealt with. Moreover, the socio-economic
impacts are very serious. 
<P>
All efforts should now be concentrated on using our better
understanding of the consequences to help those who have truly
been affected and are still in need of help.

One decade after Chernobyl:

The basis for decisions</H2>
<P>
<I>A major international conference sums up the scientific
understanding of the Chernobyl accident's major consequences</I>
<P>
<B>Highlights of results</B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<I>Although much has been learned about the tragic Chernobyl
accident of 26 April 1986 over the past 10 years, important
issues remain to be resolved. In efforts to set the factual
framework for the international community's ongoing assistance,
the IAEA, European Commission (EC), and World Health Organization
(WHO) jointly convened a major international conference in April
1996 to sum up the scientific understanding of the accident's
consequences. <A HREF="box1.html">(See box.)</A> At its
conclusion, the Conference issued a Summary of Results which was
formulated on the basis of Conference reports and keynote
presentations; background papers prepared by expert panels and
Conference discussions of them; and the conclusions of each
technical session. The Joint Secretariat of the Conference
recommended that the Summary be used as the basis for decisions
concerning future work and collaboration with the aim of
alleviating the consequences of the Chernobyl  accident. Featured
here are selected highlights from the Summary of the Conference
Results.<A HREF="#note_1">*</A></I>
<P>
<H3>Initial response to the accident</H3>
Emergency measures had to be taken to bring the  release of
radioactive material under control, to deal with the debris from
the reactor, and subsequently to construct a confinement
structure, the so-called "sarcophagus", which was completed in
November 1986, to contain the remains of the reactor core. 
<P>
The response to the accident was carried out by a large number of
ad hoc workers, including operators of the plant, emergency
volunteers such as fire-fighters and military personnel, as well
as many non-professional personnel. All these people became known
by the Russian term <I>likvidator</I>. About 200,000
"liquidators" worked in the Chernobyl region between 1986-87,
when radiation exposures were the highest. They were among some
600,000 to 800,000 persons who were registered as involved in
activities relating to alleviating the consequences of the
accident. This includes persons who participated in the clean-up
after the accident (including cleaning up around the reactor,
construction of the sarcophagus, decontamination, road building,
and destruction and burial of contaminated buildings, forests and
equipment), as well as many other general personnel who worked in
the territories designated as "contaminated" and who generally
received low doses. 
<P>
Between 27 April and mid-August 1986, about 116,000 inhabitants
were evacuated from their homes in the region around the
Chernobyl plant, the intention being to protect them from
radiation exposure. A so-called "exclusion zone" was established,
which included territories with the highest dose rates, to which
public access was prohibited. This exclusion was continued in the
independent successor countries of Belarus and Ukraine after the
dissolution of the Soviet Union. The exclusion zone covers in
total 4300 km<SUP>2</SUP>.  
<H3>Releases and deposition of radioactive material</H3>
The total activity of all the radioactive material released in
the accident is today estimated to have been around 12 x
10<SUP>18</SUP> Bq, including some 6-7 x 10<SUP>18</SUP> Bq due
to noble gases.<A HREF=#note_2">*</A> About 3% to 4%
of the used fuel in the reactor at the time of the accident as
well as up to 100% of noble gases and 20% to 60% of the volatile
radionuclides were released. This current estimate of
radioactivity is higher than the estimate of 1986. The 1986
estimate was made by authorities of the former Soviet Union on
the basis of summing the activity of the material deposited
within the countries of the former USSR. However, this
reassessment of the source term does not alter the estimations of
individual doses. 
<P>
The radionuclide composition of the material
released in the accident was complex. The radioactive isotopes of
iodine and caesium are of the greatest radiological significance:
the iodines, with their short radioactive half-lives, had the
greater radiological impact in the short term; the caesiums, with
half-lives of the order of tens of years, have the greater
radiological impact in the long term. The estimates for the
activity of the amounts of the key radionuclides released are as
follows: iodine-131: ~1.3 - 1.8 x 10<SUP>18</SUP> Bq;
caesium-134: ~0.05 x 10<SUP>18</SUP> Bq; caesium-137: ~0.09 x
10<SUP>18</SUP> Bq. These values correspond to
about 50% to 60% of the iodine-131 in the reactor core at the
time of the accident and about 20% to 40% of the two
radiocaesiums.  
<P>
<B><I>Deposition of material.</I></B> Material released to the
atmosphere was widely dispersed and eventually deposited onto the
surface of the earth. It was measurable over practically the
entire northern hemisphere.  
<P>
Most of the material was deposited in the region around the plant
site, with wide variations in deposition density. The areas of
the surrounding territories of Belarus, the Russian Federation,
and Ukraine in which activity levels of caesium-137 in excess of
185 kBq/m<SUP>2</SUP> were measured were estimated at 16,500
km<SUP>2</SUP>, 4600 km<SUP>2</SUP>, and 8100 km<SUP>2</SUP>,
respectively. 
<H3>Radiation doses</H3>
The 200,000 persons who participated in 1986-87 in the
"liquidation" of the consequences of the accident received
average doses of the order of 100 mSv.<A HREF=#note_3">**</A>
Around 10% of them received doses of the order of 250 mSv; a few
per cent received doses greater than 500 mSv; while perhaps
several tens of the people who responded initially to the
accident received potentially lethal doses of a few thousands of
millisieverts. 
<P>
The 116,000 people evacuated from the exclusion zone in 1986 were
already exposed to radiation. Fewer than 10% had received doses
of more than 50 mSv and fewer than 5% had received doses of more
than 100 mSv. 
<P>
The radioiodines released delivered radiation doses to the
thyroid gland.<A HREF=#note_4">***</A> Iodine was absorbed into
the bloodstream, generally by ingestion in foodstuffs, mainly
contaminated milk, and also by inhalation from the initial
radioactive cloud, and accumulated in the thyroid gland. Doses to
the thyroid were anticipated to be particularly high compared
with those to other body organs, especially for children.  
<P>
The long-term doses to the populations in various countries of
the
northern hemisphere  as a result of the accident, including
average doses in various countries, have been assessed by the
United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic
Radiation (UNSCEAR). UNSCEAR estimated that individual doses
outside the former USSR as a result of the accident were as
follows: the highest national average first year dose was 0.8
mSv; the highest European regional average committed dose over
the 70 years to 2056 was estimated to be 1.2 mSv. In the
International Chernobyl Project, it was estimated that the
highest committed doses for the 70 years from 1986 to 2056 for
people living in the most contaminated territories were of the
order of 160 mSv. Recent, more detailed, studies have produced
similar results. 
<H3>Health effects</H3>
<B><I>Clinically observed effects.</I></B> A total of 237
occupationally exposed individuals were suggested to
be suffering from clinical syndromes attributable to radiation
exposure and were admitted to hospital. Acute radiation syndrome
(ARS) was diagnosed in 134 cases. Of these 134 patients, 28 died
as a consequence of radiation injuries, all within the first
three months. Two more persons had died at Unit 4 from injuries
unrelated to radiation (and one additional death was thought to
have been due to a coronary thrombosis).  
<P>
Gastrointestinal damage was a serious concern, causing early and
lethal changes in
intestinal function among 11 patients who had received doses
greater than 10 Gy. The deaths of 26 of the 28 patients who died
were associated with skin lesions that affected over 50% of the
total body surface area. After the acute phase, 14 additional
patients have died over the past ten years; however, their deaths
do not correlate with the original severity of ARS and are
therefore not necessarily - and in some cases are certainly not -
directly attributable to radiation exposure. 
<P>
There is little doubt that the patients received the best
possible treatment in
line with the state of knowledge at the time, in the most
experienced centre available. However, the therapy of bone marrow
transplantation recommended at the time was of little benefit.
With today's knowledge, this is readily understandable in view of
the inherent immunological risks of the procedure, the
heterogeneous exposure characteristics and the other complicating
injuries due to radiation, such as unmanageable gastrointestinal
damage or skin lesions. Bone marrow damage can best be managed in
future by the prompt administration of haemopoietic growth
factors. The most optimal combination and dose scheduling for
these still need to be determined, however. For other radiation
damage also, new diagnostic tools have become available which may
contribute to a more accurate prognosis and more individually
tailored treatment. 
<P>
At present, the more severely affected patients suffer from
multiple ailments, including effects of
mental stress, and are in need of up-to-date treatment and
preventive measures against secondary effects. Health care should
be ensured for these patients, and their state of health should
be monitored over the forthcoming two to three decades. Among the
disease patterns encountered, it will be important to distinguish
between those that are attributable to radiation exposure and
those due to confounding factors intrinsic to the populations
affected by the accident. 
<P>
<B><I>Thyroid effects.</I></B> A highly significant increase in
the incidence of thyroid cancer among those persons
in the affected areas who were children in 1986 is the only clear
evidence to date of a public health impact of radiation exposure
caused by the Chernobyl  accident. (In 1991, the report on the
International Chernobyl Project had stated that "it is expected
that there will be a radiogenic excess of thyroid cancer cases in
the decades to come. This risk relates to thyroid doses received
in the first months after the accident..."<A
HREF=#note_5">*</A>.) This increase in
incidence has been observed in Belarus and to a lesser extent in
Ukraine and in the Russian Federation. The number of reported
cases up to the end of 1995 is about 800 in children under 15
years old at the time of diagnosis; more than 400 of these cases
were in Belarus. In most cases the diagnoses have been confirmed
by international experts. 
<P>
The increase has been observed in children who were born before
or within six months of the
accident. The incidence of thyroid cancer in children born more
than six months after the accident drops dramatically to the low
levels expected in unexposed populations. Moreover, most of the
cases of thyroid cancer are concentrated in areas thought to have
been contaminated by radioiodines as a result of the accident.
Thus both temporal and geographical distributions clearly
indicate a relationship of the increase in thyroid cancer to
radiation exposure. Furthermore, since the thyroid gland
concentrates iodine, one or more radioactive isotopes of iodine
are presumed to be the causative agents of the increase in
incidence of thyroid cancer in children.  
<P>
Analysis of exposure by age confirmed the hypothesis that very
young children were at the
greatest risk. It is now considered that the increase in the
incidence of thyroid cancer in those exposed as young children
may persist. This could increase the prevalence of thyroid cancer
in the affected group in the future, requiring adequate resources
for dealing with it. 
<P>
In the present case, the minimum latency period between exposure
and diagnosis of thyroid cancer seems to
be about four years. This latency period is somewhat shorter than
expected on the basis of previous experience related to acute
exposure to external radiation.  
<P>
To date, only three children in the cohort of diagnosed cases
have died of thyroid cancer. These
post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid cancers in children, in spite of
their aggressiveness, appear to respond favorably to standard
therapeutic procedures if appropriately applied; however, only
short term follow-up data are available as yet. There is thus a
need for complete and continuing follow-up of the affected
children in order to establish the optimal therapy. Life-long
administration of L-thyroxine to children is mandatory after
thyroidectomy.  
<P>
The extent of the future incidence of thyroid cancers as a result
of the Chernobyl accident is very difficult
to predict. There remain uncertainties in dose estimates and,
although it is not certain that the present increase in the
incidence will be sustained in the future, it will most probably
persist for several decades. If the current high relative risk is
sustained, there would be a large increase over the coming
decades in the incidence of thyroid carcinoma in adults who
received high radiation doses as children. 
<P>
In the event of any future accident, recognized measures should
be taken under strictly defined conditions to protect populations
at risk from exposure of the thyroid to radioiodine, such as
prevention of the consumption of contaminated food and iodine
prophylaxis through the distribution of pharmacological doses of
stable iodine. The populations living around the Chernobyl plant
have historically been subject to iodine deficiency, and remedy
of this deficiency through the consumption of iodized salt in
food is in any case recommended.  
<P>
<B><I>Longer term health effects.</I></B> Apart from the
confirmed increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer in young
people, there have been some reports of increases in the
incidence of specific malignancies in some populations living in
contaminated territories and in liquidators. These reports are
not consistent, however, and the reported increases could reflect
differences in the follow-up of exposed populations and increased
ascertainment following the Chernobyl accident; they may require
further investigation. 
<P>
Leukaemia, a rare disease, is a major concern after radiation
exposure. Few fatalities due to radiation
induced leukaemia would theoretically be expected according to
predictive models (based on data from the survivors of the
Japanese atomic bombing and others). The total expected excess
fatalities due to leukaemia would be of the order of 470 among
the 7.1 million residents of "contaminated" territories and
"strict control zones", which would be impossible to distinguish
from the spontaneous incidence of about 25,000 fatalities. The
total expected figure among the 200,000 liquidators (who worked
in 1986-87) would be of the order of 200 fatalities against a
spontaneous number of 800 deaths due to leukaemia. According to
current models, about 150 of these 200 excess leukaemia deaths
among the liquidators would have been expected to have occurred
in the first ten years after exposure, for which the spontaneous
incidence is 40. In summary, to date, no consistent attributable
increase has been detected either in the rate of leukaemia or in
the incidence of any malignancies other than thyroid carcinomas.
<P>
Among the 7.1 million residents of "contaminated" territories and
"strict control zones", the number of fatal cancers due to the
accident is calculated, using the predictive models, to be of the
order of 6600 over the next 85 years, against a spontaneous
number of 870,000 deaths due to cancer. Future increases over the
natural incidence of all cancers, except for thyroid cancer, or
hereditary effects among the public would be difficult to
discern, even with large and well-designed long-term
epidemiological studies, as had already been stated in the report
on the International Chernobyl Project.  
<P>
Increases in the frequency of a number of non-specific
detrimental health effects other than cancer among exposed
populations, and particularly among liquidators, have been
reported. It is difficult to interpret these findings because
exposed populations undergo a much more intensive and active
follow-up of their state of health than does the general
population. Any such increases, if real, might also reflect
effects of stress and anxiety. 
<P>
Existing population-based cancer and mortality registries should
be improved or, where appropriate, such registries should be set
up. In addition, specific studies to investigate the reported
increases and also the predicted increases, particularly in
leukaemia among liquidators, should be carried out. This should
be done using carefully designed protocols applied uniformly to
analyze, and possibly to distinguish the effects of, confounding
factors. 
<P>
<B><I>Psychological consequences.</I></B> Several important
studies
and programmes have been conducted over the past ten years to
determine social and psychological effects of the Chernobyl
accident. These have confirmed earlier findings (including those
of the International Chernobyl Project) that there are
significant psychological health disorders and symptoms among the
populations affected by the Chernobyl accident, such as anxiety,
depression and various psychosomatic disorders attributable to
mental distress.  It is extremely difficult to distinguish the
psychological effects of the Chernobyl accident from effects of
economic hardship and the dissolution of the USSR.  
<P>
The psychological effects of the Chernobyl accident resulted from
the
lack of public information, particularly immediately after the
accident, the stress and trauma of relocation, the breaking of
social ties, and the fear that any radiation exposure is damaging
and could damage people's health and their children's health in
the future. It is understandable that people who were not told
the truth for several years after the accident continue to be
skeptical of official statements and to believe that illnesses of
all kinds that now seem more prevalent must be due to radiation.
The distress caused by this misperception of radiation risks is
extremely harmful to people. 
<P>
The lack of consensus about the accident's consequences and the
politicized way in which they have
been dealt with has led to  psychological effects among the
populations that are extensive, serious and long lasting. Severe
effects include feelings of helplessness and despair, leading to
social withdrawal and loss of hope for the future. The effects
are being prolonged by the protracted debate over radiation
risks, countermeasures and general social policy, and also by the
occurrence of thyroid cancers attributed to the early exposures. 
<P>
There is an urgent need to foster trust in the personal ability
to change one's life for the better; to encourage small-scale and
communal projects to improve matters locally and to support
organizations promoting rehabilitation of the populations
concerned; to increase public knowledge of the health effects of
radiation and radiation protection; and to develop, integrate and
sustain existing networks of local authorities, specialists and
researchers in the social and psychological field. 
<H3>Environmental consequences</H3>
Concerning direct consequences for animals and plants, lethal
radiation doses were reached in some radiosensitive local
ecosystems, notably for coniferous trees and for some small
mammals within 10 km of the reactor site, in the first few weeks
after the accident. By the autumn of 1986 dose rates had fallen
by a factor of 100. By 1989 the natural environment in these
localities had begun to recover. No sustained severe impacts on
populations or ecosystems have been observed. The possibility of
long-term genetic effects and their significance remains to be
studied. 
<P>
For humans, the significance of the environmental contamination
depends on the pathways for their exposure. The main pathways are
by external irradiation from radioactive material deposited on
the ground and by internal irradiation due to the contamination
of foodstuffs. In the first few weeks after the accident,
radioiodines were the radionuclides
of the greatest radiological importance. Since 1987, most of the
radiation dose received has been due to caesium-134 and
caesium-137, with a minor contribution from strontium-90, while
plutonium-239 has made a minimal contribution to dose.  
<P>
Several items of the normal diet were contaminated by radioactive
materials. Early after the accident, key foodstuffs such as milk
and green vegetables had contamination levels in excess of what
is today considered acceptable by the WHO/FAO Codex Alimentarius
Commission, set as maximum permitted contamination levels for
foodstuffs moving in international trade. (These levels are now
globally established by the International Basic Safety Standards
for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of
Radiation Sources.) There are some questions about the
effectiveness of the control measures that were taken in the
early stages following the accident.  
<P>
Countermeasures are relatively inefficient in reducing external
exposures but can be very efficient in reducing the uptake of
radioactive material. In the long term, the appropriate
application of agricultural countermeasures can reduce the uptake
of caesium into food. The effectiveness of countermeasures
depends  on local conditions such
as soil type. For example, in some localities where the amount of
caesium deposited on the ground was relatively small, the
transfer to milk could nevertheless be high. In general, no food
produced by collective farms now exceeds the WHO/FAO Codex
Alimentarius levels, although some foods produced by private
farmers do exceed these levels.  
<P>
The semi-natural environment, i.e. with characteristics
intermediate between those of managed agricultural land and those
of natural environments, may have a predominant influence on the
levels of future doses to the human population. The transfer
factor for radionuclides from soil to the milk of cows grazing on
meadows varies by a factor of several hundred, depending on the
type of soil. Some food products derived from animals that graze
in semi-natural pastures, forests and mountain areas, and wild
foods (such as game, berries and
mushrooms), will continue to show levels of  caesium-137 that
exceed the Codex Alimentarius levels  - in some cases greatly - 
over the next decades and are likely to be a major source of
internal doses in the future. 
<P>
Local dose rates of radioactive material buried at the Chernobyl
site can be considerable. Furthermore, for orderly management of
the provisional depositories of radioactive residues from the
accident, the potential contamination of the local groundwater in
the long term should be considered. 
<H3>Social, economic, institutional, and political impact</H3>
Between 1990 and end-1995, decisions were taken by authorities to
further resettle people in Ukraine (about 53,000 persons),
Belarus (about 107,000 persons), and the Russian Federation
(about 50,000 persons). Evacuation and resettlement has created
several serious social problems, linked to the difficulties and
hardships of adjusting to the new living
conditions. 
<P>
Demographic indicators in "contaminated" regions have
worsened: the birth rate has decreased, and the work force is
migrating from "contaminated" areas to "uncontaminated" areas,
creating shortages of labour and professional staff.  
<P>
The control measures imposed by the authorities to limit
radiation exposure in "contaminated" territories have limited
industrial and agricultural activities. Moreover, the attitude of
the general population towards products from "contaminated" areas
makes it difficult for produce to be sold or exported, leading to
reductions in local incomes.  
<P>
Restrictions on people's customary activities make everyday life
difficult and distressing. Major
rehabilitative actions have been undertaken over the past years.
However, it is necessary to provide the public with more and
better information on the measures taken to limit the
consequences of the accident, on present radiation levels and on
radionuclide concentrations measured in foodstuffs. 
<P>
The social and economic conditions of people living and working
in "contaminated" territories are heavily dependent on public
subsidies. If the compensation system in force were to be
reconsidered, some funds could be redirected to new industrial
and agricultural projects. 
<P>
The consequences of the Chernobyl
accident and the measures taken in response, exacerbated by the
political, economic and social changes of the past few years,
have led to a worsening in the quality of life and of public
health as well as to unfavorable effects on social activity. The
situation was further complicated in the years after the accident
by incomplete and inaccurate public information on the accidents
consequences and on measures for their alleviation. 
<H3>Nuclear safety and the sarcophagus</H3>
The main cause of the Chernobyl accident lay in the coincidence
of severe deficiencies in the design of the reactor and of the
shutdown system, and the violation of procedures. The lack of
"safety culture" in the responsible organizations of the Soviet
Union resulted in an inability to remedy such design weaknesses,
even though they had
been known before the accident.  
<P>
In addition to those features of direct relevance to the causes
of the accident, the original design of plants with RBMK reactors
(Soviet light water cooled, graphite moderated reactors) had
further deficiencies. In
particular, the original design of the first generation of RBMK
reactors falls short of present safety objectives. Remaining
deficiencies, such as the partial containment, require further
attention. 
<P>
In accordance with a dynamic approach to safety, all
nuclear power plants that do not meet an internationally
acceptable level of safety need appropriate upgrading or should
be shut down. In September 1991, the IAEA Conference on The
Safety of Nuclear Power: Strategy for the Future expressed a
consensus that the safety standards of older operating plants
should be reasonably compliant with current safety objectives.
Active commitment to this objective remains of prime importance
for ensuring an acceptable level of safety for nuclear
installations and for enhancing public confidence in nuclear
energy. 
<P>
A significant number of remedial measures to enhance
nuclear safety have been taken over the past decade at existing
plants with RBMK reactors: technical and organizational measures
were taken immediately after the Chernobyl accident, as well as
safety upgrades performed between 1987 and 1991 which essentially
remedied the design deficiencies that contributed to the
accident. Progress has also been achieved in areas such as plant
management, training of personnel, non-destructive testing and
safety analysis. As a result, a repetition of the same accident
scenario seems no longer practically possible. However, the
possibility of other accidents leading to substantial releases
cannot be excluded. 
<P>
For all RBMK plants, there are plans for
further safety improvements to remedy those design deficiencies
of RBMK reactors that are not directly related to the Chernobyl
accident. The implementation of these plans is lagging behind
what is needed because the countries concerned lack the necessary
resources. 
<P>
Expedited implementation of what has been agreed to be
necessary and has already been planned  is a top priority for the
national nuclear programmes as well as for international
co-operation: necessary safety improvements must be carried out
independently from consideration of early decommissioning of the
plants; more resources must be made available for enhancing the
safety of the RBMK plants that are currently operated; the status
of national regulatory authorities and their support
organizations must be strengthened. 
<P>
Similar backfits as for other RBMK units were also performed at
the Chernobyl plant. However,
safety concerns with RBMK units are not only related to the
generic design deficiencies, but also to the quality of
equipment. 
<P>
The decision of the Ukrainian authorities to close
down the remaining units at Chernobyl is not a reason for
neglecting the need for safety measures and backfits during the
remaining time of operation.  
<P>
<B><I>The sarcophagus.</I></B> The sarcophagus
that was constructed around the destroyed reactor presently
contains about 200 tones of irradiated and fresh nuclear fuel,
mixed with other materials in various forms, mainly as dust. The
total activity of this material is estimated to be 700 x
10<SUP>15</SUP> Bq of long-lived radionuclides. The sarcophagus
has met the objectives set for the purposes of protection over
the past 10 years. In the long term, however, its stability and
the quality of its confinement are in doubt. A collapse of the
structure could lead to a release of radioactive dust and the
exposure to radiation of the personnel employed at the site.
However, even in a worst case, widespread effects (beyond 30 km
away) would not be expected.  
<P>
It has been found that the sarcophagus is currently safe from the
point of view of the occurrence of a criticality. It cannot be
completely excluded that there exist configurations
of fuel masses inside the sarcophagus that could reach a critical
state when in contact with water. However, even if such a
condition were to lead to elevated radiation levels inside the
sarcophagus, large off-site releases would not be expected. The
possible impact of such a state on site personnel needs to be
clarified.  
<P>
Opinions differ widely about the significance of the
risk of an accident in Chernobyl Unit 3 caused by a collapse of
the sarcophagus. More detailed investigations of this issue are
required. 
<P>
The safety of the remaining units and the stability of
the sarcophagus are not the only major issues still to be
resolved at the Chernobyl site. Further concerns relate to the
potential for contamination, in particular to the radioactive
material buried at the site. These issues are interrelated and an
integrated approach is required to resolve them. The proposed
construction of a second shelter over the sarcophagus should be
part of such an approach. The actions financed by the EC in this
area have contributed to achieving an integrated approach. This
approach now needs to be generalized, and the knowhow of the
competent organizations of the former USSR should be more
effectively integrated. Research and development of an adequate
design are necessary in order to ensure that the sarcophagus is
ecologically safe. 
<P>
A cost-effective procedure requires that
suitable steps be taken, in accordance with the progress of
studies and the financial circumstances. The first measure should
be the stabilization of the existing sarcophagus. This would
significantly reduce the risk of its collapse and would provide
the time required for the careful planning of further measures
(such as a second shelter). 
<P>
<H3>Perspective and prognosis</H3>
Full rehabilitation of the exclusion zone is not currently
possible
due to: the existence of "hot spots" of contamination near
residential areas; the possibility of local radioactive
contamination of groundwater; the hazard associated with possible
collapse of the sarcophagus; and severe restrictions imposed on
diet and lifestyle. 
<P>
Any estimates of the total number of fatal
and non-fatal cancers attributable to the accident should be
interpreted with caution in view of the uncertainties associated
with the assumptions on which they must be based. Such
projections do, however, provide a perspective on the magnitude
of the long-term impact and help in identifying areas needing
special attention, both now (such as the incidence of leukaemia
among the liquidators and of thyroid cancer among children living
in "contaminated" areas) and in the future. 
<P>
There is a major discrepancy between the number of thyroid
cancers appearing in those who were children at the time of the
accident and the predicted number of such cancers on the basis of
standard thyroid dosimetry and current risk projection models.
This difference may be the result of several factors unique to
the accident which are not typically incorporated into standard
models. It is important to clarify these issues as well as to
continue the programs for the detection of thyroid tumors. 
<P>
The increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer will most
probably persist for several decades. While it is not possible to
predict with certainty on the basis
of current data, the estimated number of thyroid cancers to be
expected among those who were children in 1986 is up to a few
thousand. The number of fatalities should be much lower than
this, if cancer is diagnosed in the early stage and if
appropriate treatment is given. These people should continue to
be closely monitored throughout their lives. 
<P>
Despite the extensive scientific and medical knowledge of
radiation effects, there remain important open questions with
regard to the human health effects of radiation. It is necessary
to continue to support research into the biological effects of
radiation. 
<P>
Different factors, such as economic hardship, are having a marked
effect on the health of the population in general, including the
various groups exposed as a result of the accident. The
statistics for the exposed populations are being examined in the
light of the clear general increase in morbidity and mortality in
the countries of the former Soviet Union so as to preclude the
misinterpretation of these trends as being due to the accident.
<P>
The public perception of the present and future impact of the
accident may have been exacerbated by the difficult socioeconomic
circumstances in the USSR at the time, by the countermeasures
that the authorities took to minimize the accident's impact, and
by the public's impression of the risks from the continuing
levels of radioactive contamination. 
<P>
Past experience of accidents
unrelated to radiation has shown that the psychological impact
may persist for a long period. In fact, ten years after the
Chernobyl accident, the evolution of symptoms has not ended. It
can be expected that the importance of this effect will decrease
with time. However, the continuing debate over radiation risks
and countermeasures, combined with the fact that effects of the
early exposures are now being seen (i.e. the significant rise in
thyroid cancers among children), may prolong the symptoms. In
evaluating the psychological impact, account should be taken of
the psychological effects of the breakup of the USSR, and any
forecast should take into account the economic, political and
sociological circumstances of the three countries. The symptoms
such as anxiety associated with mental stress may be among the
major legacies of the accident. 
<P>
In view of the low risk
associated with the present radiation levels in most of the
"contaminated" areas, the benefits of future efforts to reduce
doses still further to the public would be outweighed by the
negative economic, social and psychological impacts. It is
important to develop a strategy that takes into account both the
real radiological risk and the economic, social and psychological
disbenefits in order to yield the greatest net benefit in human
terms. In addition, measures to mitigate the psychological impact
should be considered.

Social, health, & environmental effects</H2>
<I>Reports on topics addressed at technical sessions of the
International Conference convened in Vienna 10 years after the
Chernobyl accident</I>
<P>
<B><I>Report by Ms. Mona Dreicer, United States, who served as
Rapporteur, and Academician Rudolf Alexakhin, Institute of
Agricultural Radiology and Agroecology, Obninsk, Russian
Federation, who served as Vice Chairman, Topical Session 5:
Consequences for the environment.</I></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
A question often posed by the public and decision-makers is:
"What is the expert view of the environmental damage that
resulted from the Chernobyl accident, and what can be expected in
the future?"
<P>
Deriving a  single answer is difficult: there were large
variations in the levels of environmental contamination, a lack
of a common unit of measure with which to present the varied
environmental consequences, and a broad range of possible
interpretations of the consequences. Traditionally in radiation
protection, the natural environment is considered to be protected
if the human population is protected. So in most cases, the
consequences are viewed solely in terms of impact on humans. It
is for this reason that the most effective methods of restricting
the natural course of the transfer of radionuclides in the
environment (by so-called countermeasures) have been aggressively
studied during the last 10 years. Besides providing important
information for the development of radiation protection policy
for the areas affected by the accident, advances have been made
in basic radio-ecological research. 
<P>
Presented here is a brief summary of recent estimates of the
initial releases to the environment as a result of the Chernobyl
accident, the observed impacts from increased levels of radiation
on plants and animals near the site, and the transport of
radionuclides in the environment. 
<P>
<B>Recent estimates of radioactive releases.</B> Broad agreement
has been reached among various estimates concerning the initial
environmental release due to the accident. Most of the material
released was short half-lived radionuclides. Releases to the
environment of some radiologically important radionuclides
(iodine-131, caesium-134, and caesium-137) are estimated now at a
factor of two to three higher than in 1986, namely 2
exa-becquerel (EBq), 50 peta-becquerel (PBq) and 90 PBq,
respectively. However, the reassessment of the source term has
had no impact on the assessment of individual doses, which were
based on the environmental or whole body measurements made in the
affected areas. The total amount of radioactive material still
present in the environment after 10 years has decayed to about 80
PBq of long-lived radionuclides, principally caesium-137 and
strontium-90, or about 1% of the total amount released. <A
HREF="box2.html"><I>(See table.)</I></A>
<P>
Overall patterns of contamination by these long-lived
radionuclides have remained  essentially unchanged over the last
10 years, with relatively little secondary transport of material.
Hot fuel particles released from the reactor are one of the
factors of this accident that differentiate it from weapons
fallout material. Close to the reactor, these particles are
beginning to disintegrate and further study is needed to
understand their final distribution in the environment. 
<P>
<B>Direct effects on plants and animals.</B> The highest doses
immediately after the accident were received by plants and
animals within a radius of 30 kilometers from the reactor.
Contamination levels typically reached several tens of
mega-becquerel (MBq) per m<SUP>2</SUP> (thousands of
Ci/km<SUP>2</SUP>) in some localities and external doses would
correspondingly have been of the order of several tens of gray
(Gy) to vegetation and small animals in the first month from the
short-lived radionuclides. By the autumn of 1986, the dose rate
at the soil surface dropped by a factor of 100 of the initial
value. 
<P>
Direct radiation injury to plants and animals was reported only
in local areas within the 30-km exclusion zone. Different
organisms in the natural environment were exposed to high doses,
and the lethal doses for some radiosensitive ecosystems were
reached. These lethal effects were seen in the coniferous forests
in the nearest areas and for some small mammals.  
<P>
Severe direct effects of high radiation doses  were observed in
some individual animals, but were not necessarily significant in
changing the overall health of the population. For example, cows
grazing contaminated pastures near the reactor in the early phase
after the accident received thyroid doses in the range of
hundreds of Gy, resulting in atrophy and total necrosis of the
thyroid. For other ecosystems, individual plants, and animals, no
lethal effects were observed. 
<P>
In most cases, the plant and animal populations affected by
radiation returned to normal in a few years. An example of this
can be seen in a 3000-hectare region around the plant: by 1988-89
the damaged conifers had recovered their reproductive functions,
and today it seems likely that they will recover fully. Chronic
dose rates in some areas within the 30-km exclusion zone may have
reduced the fertility of animals of some species but it appears
that other affected animal populations have already recovered.
The significance of the observed changes in the long-term health
of the specific populations is difficult to determine at this
time. 
<P>
There were media reports of severe birth defects in agricultural
animals outside the 30-km zone in 1988-89; however, the frequency
of these reported defects was shown to be similar in highly
contaminated and non-contaminated regions of Ukraine, leading to
the conclusion that the defects were not due to increased
radiation dose. There have been no further reports of severe
effects observed in farm animals. 
<P>
There have been some reports of damage to mitochondrial
chromosomes that have been passed on to subsequent offspring in
high dose rate areas, but other evidence supports general
recovery from the radiation damage. Today, there is no general
consensus on potential long-term hereditary impacts on plants and
animals where the doses were very high.  
<P>
After 10 years, the major contributors to the low-dose chronic
radiation are the remaining caesium radionuclides. The external
dose in some isolated spots can still be of the order of 1 mGy
per day; however, even in the 30-km zone, the natural environment
seems to be recovering.  Owing to the relocation of people from
the 30-km zone, there have been some changes in the numbers and
variety of animal and plant communities, but these changes have
resulted from disuse of the land, not from radiation effects.
Some natural populations have thrived as a result of the lack of
human interference. No evidence has been found that any plant or
animal species have been permanently eliminated from the most
contaminated areas, except where clean-up activities involving
soil removal have drastically altered the ecosystem. 
<P>
<B>Contamination in the environment.</B> In the semi-natural
environment, the key factors controlling the migration of
radionuclides from topsoil into plants in meadow ecosystems are
the clay and organic content of the soil and soil moisture. In
general, the current migration rate is slow and steady and is
expected to continue over the coming decades, even as the level
of radioactive material in the soil declines. The transfer of
strontium-90 is faster than for  caesium-137, but the influence
of the different types of soil is similar. This rate of transfer
is an important consideration in the decisions regarding the
long-term use of meadows as cow pastures. 
<P>
Today, nearly all the contamination in forest ecosystems is found
in the topsoil. The radiocaesium in trees is concentrated in the
new growth rings owing to the transfer from the soil through the
roots. This is not a significant problem but will increase the
caesium-137 concentration in wood. No cost-effective
countermeasure to reduce this transfer has been found. 
<P>
Game animals that graze in semi-natural pastures, forests or
mountainous areas, and wild foods consumed by people, such as
berries and mushrooms, will continue to show elevated caesium-137
levels over the next decades. These foods may still be
contaminated above the strict nationally adopted limits in areas
of Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, as well as in Nordic countries
and the United Kingdom. The caesium-137 in these areas will
remain available to be transferred into food products for a
longer time period than in agricultural environments. 
<P>
Since 1986, in the agricultural environment, effective
application of countermeasures resulting in significant
reductions of caesium and strontium into food has been
demonstrated. The level of contamination, type of soil, soil
moisture, and crop type are important influencing factors. For
example, depending on the type of soil, the transfer factor
between pasture and milk varies by several hundred, clearly
illustrating that the proper application of these actions are
very site specific. Relatively simple, inexpensive and successful
agricultural countermeasures include: deep ploughing of surface
contaminated soils; addition of fertilizers or other chemicals to
agricultural lands; change in crop type; changing feeding regimes
and slaughtering times of cattle; the use of impregnated
"Prussian Blue" salt licks and boli to reduce the transfer of
caesium to cattle; and relocation of animals to uncontaminated
pastures. <I>(See related article in this edition, page 38.)</I>
<P>
Aquatic ecosystems have been shown to be tolerant of the
radioactive contamination that gradually concentrates in the
sediments. Even in the cooling pond of the Chernobyl power plant,
only certain populations were affected, and no long-term direct
radiation effects have been documented. The amount of radioactive
material that found its way into freshwater aquatic systems was
small compared to the total amount deposited. The surface water
activity levels fell dramatically within one month of the
accident. The public's perception notwithstanding, current
contamination levels in reservoirs are well below the criteria
that indicate a degradation in water quality. Fish, however, may
accumulate radionuclides and countermeasures may be necessary in
some places (even in countries far away, such as Sweden). 
<P>
<B>Conclusions.</B> It can be concluded that at high radiation
levels the natural environment showed short-term impacts in some
high dose rate areas but existence of significant long-term
impacts remains to be seen; and that effective countermeasures
can be taken to reduce the transfer of contamination from the
environment to the human population but these are highly site
specific and must be evaluated in terms of practicality. If
agricultural countermeasures are appropriately implemented, the
main source of future doses will be due to the gathering of food
and recreational activities in natural and semi-natural
ecosystems.

<H2>Social/psychological effects</H2>
<B><I>Report by Ms. Britt-Marie Drottz-Sj&ouml;berg, Centre for
Risk
Research, Sweden, who served as Chairperson, Topical Session 4,
entitled   Other health-related effects: Psychological
consequences, stress, anxiety , and by G.M. Rumyantseva, Serbsky
Center of Social and Forensic Psychiatry, Moscow; A.I. Nyagu,
Institute of Radiation Medicine, Kiev, Ukraine; and L.A. Ageeva,

<P>
Joint Study Project-2 -  a collaboration between researchers from
Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and
financed by the European Commission  - was initiated in 1991-92
and concluded in 1995. One facet of research  focused on
Chernobyl's  social and psychological effects.
<P>
Several investigations were designed to describe public reactions
to the Chernobyl accident among directly affected people, i.e.
people living in areas with different levels of contamination and
people who had been resettled due to the accident. Such groups
were compared to control groups living in radiologically
non-affected areas. Interviews and survey studies focused on
psychological reactions, including stress, experiences of
personal mastery, common sentiments, and perceptions of risk
related to various kinds of hazards. They also covered, for
example, measures of trust in information sources, self-rated
knowledge of radiation, perceived degree of radioactive
contamination of the home area, and standards of living. A total
of 5000 individuals were involved in the investigations.
<P>
Previous studies had shown that psychological problems associated
with the Chernobyl accident were not decreasing with time. People
experienced exposure to real risks, and resettled people often
provided the highest risk ratings. Responses to a question about
the ability to protect oneself from radioactive contamination
were overall discouraging. People indicated an interest, however,
in improving their knowledge of radiation and radioactive
contamination. Worries were focused on health risks due to
radioactive contamination, but there was also considerable
concern about hardships of everyday life. Worries about everyday
life increased stress. In the contaminated areas, factors
specific to radiation also had effects  - for example,
self-attributed radiation knowledge had an effect in reducing
stress. 
<P>
Similarly, the extent to which people believed they could affect
the amount of dose they received also reduced stress. The result
furthermore indicated that people who tended to believe that
things are determined by fate were somewhat more likely to have a
higher dose compared to others. People who had resettled
voluntarily and found the relocation justified indicated the
lowest level of distress. Those who resettled involuntarily and
who did not find the relocation justified reacted the strongest.
Trust in various information sources was overall low, but foreign
experts gained a higher rating than domestic experts, and health
promotion bodies were more trusted than various political bodies.
<P>
People who paid more attention to media also gave higher ratings
of everyday worry. An analysis of selected Russian, Ukrainian,
and Belarussian newspapers at various points in time showed as a
common feature that a great majority of the articles were written
by journalists. Material written by experts, specialists, and
authorities was much less frequently published, but appeared to
some extent in 1986 and then again from 1989-90 onwards. Another
common feature was that newspaper materials in 1986 and 1987
tended to have a soothing emotional content. Emotionally strained
materials appeared more frequently around 1990 and onwards. The
appearance of strained material around 1990 has been interpreted
as reflecting the uncertain political climate at the time of the
USSR's dissolution, and the election campaigns.
<P>
The study also demonstrated different reactions to the accident
and different needs among the population, with changes over time.
The differences seem to be increasing between directly affected
population groups and others. In the short- and medium-time
perspective, similar needs for information, behavioural
recommendations, and health care seem to appear. 
<P>
For the long term, however, our results point to the importance
of preparedness for the emergence of new needs generated by the
countermeasures themselves, e.g. relocation. The results suggest
that voluntariness or personal choice are associated with less
psychological distress. In Russia, relocation strategies appear
to have altered the psychological outlook, as well as reduced the
stress. The policy was implemented in a staged manner, being
mainly voluntary, spread over time, accompanied by significant
financial benefits, and facilitating the maintenance of social
networks. Regarding organized health care, it may be that
preparedness for immediate and large-scale medical screening is a
necessity after a radiological accident, but the medium-term
strategy could include other options moving away from mandatory
rules, e.g. services for counselling or for measuring personal
dose or food products. The long-term management of health risk
could be tailored to needs of affected and vulnerable groups.
<P>
Similarly it seems that financial support and compensation
strategies become very important in the immediate and medium-term
perspective, but that the beneficial effects may be threatened in
the longer term if they create dependency rather than enhance
self-sufficiency. One lesson of relocation which is seldom
addressed concerns information and support to the communities
which accommodate new members. Although relocated people may be
provided with newly constructed housing they will nevertheless
have an impact on the local community. Well-being could be
increased in the communities if long-term risk management
includes a review of common resources and helps accommodate
common needs.
<P>
The results of the investigations must be related to the changes
introduced by the policy of <I>perestroika</I> and
<I>glasnost</I>, and the intensified social uncertainty which
occurred during the
mid-1980s and early 1990s. The Chernobyl accident divides a more
than 70-year-old social system from a new time. Its significance
will therefore remain salient in people's minds for a long time.
Peoples' reactions to a radiological accident may have lasting
emotional, social, and economic effects on a community or
society. If these reactions become better understood, the
knowledge facilitates improved risk management, effective risk
mitigation, optimal use of financial resources,  and relief from
unnecessary suffering.  Our empirical studies contribute new
information and knowledge due to the massive scale of
investigations and detailed analyses of specific groups. Control
groups have been involved to adjust for overall major social and
political changes. The project has also shown the feasibility of
investigating citizens' personal experiences for facilitating
specific current needs and future planning. The research further
has gained knowledge because of international co-operation and
the personal exchange of experience and information.

<B><I>Report by Gerard Wagemaker, Erasmus University, European

"Clinically observed effects" and by Angelina K. Guskova, 
Institute of Biophysics, Moscow, Russia, who served as Session
Vice-Chairwoman, and Vladimir G. Bebeshko, Scientific Center of

<P>
When radiation doses to the tissues of  a mammalian organism are
large enough, there may be a partial or complete loss of
function. In extreme cases, there may be complete tissue death.
If the tissue is vital, it may result in death. There have been
many accidents with radiation sources that have caused serious
local injury, sometimes calling for the amputation of limbs.
<P>
Among the victims of the Chernobyl accident were people who were
accidentally exposed to high doses of radiation. Such high-dose
exposures - which acutely and severely affect blood cell
production, resistance against infections, and intestinal
functions - may result in severe damage to the skin. The complex
of disease symptoms from such exposures is known as "acute
radiation syndrome", or ARS. Its  most common symptoms are
initially nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea and, later on, bleeding
and generalized infections with high fever, often caused by
micro-organisms that are normally not harmful. If untreated, ARS
is lethal, even following radiation doses which are not
necessarily incompatible with survival of the human organism and
are regularly used in clinical medicine to treat some forms of
cancer. In an accident situation, the radiation damage is
frequently even more complicated by other injury, such as thermal
burns. 
<P>
The Chernobyl accident resulted in a total number of 237
individuals who were suspected of suffering from ARS. The
diagnosis was confirmed in 134. Of these, 41 had mild (grade I)
ARS; all survived; one additional case is still disputed. Fifty
patients had grade II ARS, of whom one died. Twenty-two patients
had grade III ARS, of whom seven died. Of the 21 patients most
severely affected, who suffered from grade IV ARS, all died
except one. Among this group, gastrointestinal damage was the
most severe problem in patients who received doses greater than
10 Gy and resulted in early and lethal changes in intestinal
function. Deaths in 26 patients in the first three months after
the exposure were associated with skin lesions involving over 50%
of the total body surface area. In general, there appeared to be
a relation between ARS and the skin area damaged, indicating that
almost all severely affected patients had combined injury. 
<I>(See graph.)</I>
<P>
The Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident led to exposure with
high amounts of beta irradiation (both contamination and
incorporation), causing a clinical pattern of involvement which
was different from the experience at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. From
the onset, a striking feature was the large number of patients
suffering from radiation-induced damage of the skin and mucous
membranes, especially of the upper digestive and respiratory
tract, due to contamination by beta and gamma-emitting isotopes,
such as caesium-137, caesium-134, and strontium-90. Skin lesions
and/or oropharyngeal mucositis were a major contribution to the
death of patients who died as an immediate consequence of the
accident.
<P>
Patients surviving ARS have all been subjected to a traumatic
experience with extensive physical injury and long convalescence
periods. Some will bear the marks of their trauma for the rest of
their lives, both in the psychological and  somatic sense, just
as victims of other severe accidents have done. Although the
extreme bone marrow suppression may have been resolved in a
couple of months, full reconstitution of immune functions may
take at least half a year and may well not normalize within years
after exposure. This does not necessarily mean that these
patients have a functionally impaired immune system. 
<P>
In patients with severe skin injury complicated by surgery and
ill-healing wounds, the long recovery period may cause chronic
stress. It may also  be expected that biochemical stress indices
in these patients score high. In males, reproductive recovery may
be very slow and in the higher dose ranges, impaired fertility
may be a lasting effect. Several components of the eye are rather
sensitive to radiation, and patients in particular may develop
cataracts, starting years after exposure. Following high
radiation doses, cardiovascular and late gastrointestinal
problems may cause considerable discomfort.
<P>
After the accident's acute phase, 14 of the 237 patients have
died over the last decade. Their deaths do not relate to the
original severity of ARS and are, in most cases, probably not
directly attributable to the radiation exposure, although it is
difficult to exclude an impact from the accident. In fact, five
of these 14 patients did not suffer from ARS in the first place
and may have received only very low doses of radiation.
<P>
The remaining patients who have suffered ARS are in general in an
acceptable health condition and are being monitored regularly.
There is good evidence that the quality of life of the surviving
patients may be amenable to improvement. At least the more
severely affected patients suffer presently from multiple
diseases and are in need of up-to-date treatment and secondary
prevention; also their mental health might be suboptimal.
Therefore, more has to be done in the future to distinguish in
the encountered disease patterns those that are attributable to
the radiation exposure and those that are  due to confounding
factors intrinsic to the population. The follow-up of these
patients needs to be assured for the forthcoming two to three
decades, preferably co-ordinated by a single center of high
clinical and research competence. 
<P>
The Chernobyl cases have taught us that much needed (and still
needs) to be improved in the clinical management of ARS in
accident situations generally complicated by radiation injury to
the skin and injuries that are not radiation related. There is
little doubt that ARS patients, and those with severe skin
injury, have received the best possible treatment in line with
the state of knowledge at the time in the most experienced center
available. 
<P>
The therapy of bone marrow transplantation recommended at the
time was of little benefit for the most severely affected
patients. From today's knowledge this is understandable. In any
future accident, it is inconceivable that bone marrow
transplantation as applied in the most severe cases of the
Chernobyl accident will be used. New agents have become
available, in particular a group of cytokines collectively known
as hemopoietic growth factors, which have the capacity to
stimulate recovery of the blood and immune system. 
<P>
Bone marrow damage can in future cases best be managed by rapid
administration of hemopoietic growth factors, even though the
most optimal combination and dose scheduling still needs to be
worked out. However, advances in the transplantation of blood
stem cells and tissue typing make it very likely that
transplantation will still be considered as a life-saving
supportive measure, especially in cases where bone marrow damage
is too severe to expect an effective response to the newer
therapeutics. Also for other radiation damage, new diagnostic
tools may contribute to a more accurate prognosis and more
tailored treatment.

<H2>Thyroid effects</H2>

who served as the Scientific Secretary, Prof. A. Pinchera,

Session 2: "Thyroid effects", and Prof. D. Becker, Cornell

Session's Expert Committee.</I></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The population in the area around Chernobyl, particularly
southern Belarus and northern Ukraine, was exposed to high levels
of fallout from the Chernobyl accident including large amounts of
radioactive iodine. As the thyroid gland concentrates iodine, it
was exposed to higher levels of radiation than other body
tissues. The radioactive isotope of iodine, iodine-131, has been
extensively and safely used in the treatment of thyrotoxicosis.
Thus, the report of increased numbers of thyroid carcinoma in
children in areas exposed to fallout from Chernobyl was
surprising to some, both because of the previous lack of thyroid
carcinoma in patients treated with radioactive iodine, and
because of the very short time (four years) between exposure and
the start of the increase.
<P>
This report considers the size of the increase in thyroid
carcinoma after taking into account the evidence that the
increase is related to exposure to fallout from Chernobyl, the
isotope or isotopes responsible, and the likely future effects.
<P>
The Chernobyl accident was the first time such a large population
was exposed to high levels of radioactive fallout. The amounts of
radioactive material released were huge, and one of the main
constituents was  iodine-131.  Very short-lived isotopes of
iodine were also released. Direct data on the uptake of the very
short-lived isotopes of iodine are not available; measurements of
iodine-131 uptake were made after the time of peak uptake. 
<P>
The estimated absorbed doses to the thyroid from iodine-131 in
different settlements,  which are not necessarily representative
of the whole district, ranged from 790-2400 mGy for infants, and
190-370 mGy for adults.  Exposure to short-lived isotopes of
iodine increases this figure by an unknown amount, and the early
estimates of thyroid dose may need recalculation. Some studies
suggest that the average dose in Gomel oblast for children aged
0-7 was about 420 mGy, while doses reported in the recent Nuclear
Energy Agency appraisal show that the average dose of children
aged 0-7 assessed in Gomel oblast was about 1 Gy, with over 9%
having doses in the range of 10-40 Gy.
<P>
In the first four years after the accident,  the numbers of
childhood thyroid cancers occurring in Belarus were in single
figures, while in 1990, 29 cases were diagnosed, rising to 79 in
1993 and 82 in 1994. At the time of medical operation, about half
of the cases showed direct invasion of surrounding tissues, while
two-thirds showed lymph node metastases. Only four cases have
been seen in children born after 1986, although it must be
remembered that they were no more than eight years old in 1994. 
<P>
At the Endocrine Institute in Kiev, Ukraine,  eight to 11 cases
of childhood thyroid cancer were diagnosed annually during the
first four years after the accident.  But the figure rose to 26
in 1990 and to 43 in 1993, with 39 in 1994. Of these cases, 60%
showed soft tissue invasion at surgery, and lymph node metastases
were present in 60% of cases. Only one of the 114 confirmed cases
seen at the Institute was in a child born after 1986.  In Russia,
only one child with thyroid cancer was recorded in Bryansk oblast
between 1986-89, while between 1990-94 inclusive 23 cases of
thyroid carcinoma were reported in children under the age of 15
at diagnosis.
<P>
A recent survey of the histological diagnosis of the thyroid
cancers from Belarus found 98% agreement in 134 cases studied
jointly by staff of the Pathology Institute in Belarus and the
Department of Histopathology in Cambridge.  In the whole series
of 298 cases seen in the Institute of Pathology in Belarus
between 1990-94, a total of 98% were papillary carcinomas, 1.3%
were follicular carcinomas, and 0.3% medullary carcinomas. 
<P>
The findings in the cases from Ukraine were remarkably similar to
those from Belarus. Of the 122 cases of thyroid cancer diagnosed
in children under the age of 15 at the Institute of Endocrinology
in Kiev between 1990-94 inclusive, 114 cases have been studied
jointly in Kiev and Cambridge, and the diagnosis agreed in over
97% of them. Of the cancers with agreed diagnosis, 94% were
papillary in type, 2% were medullary, and 4% follicular
carcinomas. Material from ten cases of childhood thyroid cancer
in children from contaminated areas of Bryansk, Kaluga, or Tula
oblasts of Russia have been studied by pathologists from the RAMS
in Obninsk and Cambridge. No tumour was present in the material
available for study in one case, the remaining nine cases were
all papillary carcinomas, including one papillary microcarcinoma.
Overall these results confirm diagnoses of thyroid malignancy
made in the CIS. They also show that while the same types of
childhood thyroid cancer are seen in the exposed areas as are
found in an unexpected population, types other than papillary
carcinoma form only a very small proportion of the cases in the
exposed areas.
<P>
The results of molecular biological studies show a close link
between the type of oncogene involved and the pathological type
of tumour found, so that the increased frequency of thyroid
carcinoma in children in areas around Chernobyl is an increase in
a particular type of thyroid tumour, papillary carcinoma,
associated  in many cases with rearrangement in a particular
oncogene, ret. No increase has been shown in activation of the
other types of oncogenes known to be associated with thyroid
carcinogenesis which were studied, the three ras genes, TSHr and
p53.
<P>
In Belarus, the Gomel oblast, which borders Ukraine close to
Chernobyl, received the highest exposure to fallout. During
1990-94, a total of 172 cases occurred in children from Gomel,
with a current population of 0.37 million children, compared to
143 cases in the rest of Belarus, where 1.96 million children
live. The crude rates for childhood thyroid cancer in Gomel
during 1990-94 are therefore 92 per million children per year,
and for the rest of Belarus 14.6 per million children per year.
<P>
Similarly in Ukraine, the northern oblasts  bordering Belarus
received a much higher exposure than the remainder of Ukraine. A
total of 112 cases occurred during 1990-94 in the six
contaminated oblasts, with a population of 2 million children,
and 65 cases in the rest of the Ukraine with a population of 8.8
million children. The crude rates for the northern oblasts of
Ukraine are 10.6 per million children per year, and for the rest
of the Ukraine 1.5 per million children per year. 
<P>
The rates in Belarus and Ukraine before Chernobyl, and the rate
in England and Wales in a 30-year study, are all about 0.5 per
million children per year. We can therefore conclude that there
has been a very large increase in incidence of childhood thyroid
carcinoma in the areas around Chernobyl and that this is
correlated to the exposure to fallout.
<P>
When the cases of childhood thyroid carcinoma occurring in
Belarus are divided into cohorts based on the age at exposure to
the Chernobyl accident, the ratio of observed to expected number
of cases was greatest in the children who were youngest at the
time of Chernobyl, and dropped rapidly with increasing age at
exposure. This increased sensitivity of very young children to
the effects of fallout on the thyroid is consistent with
observations of the increased sensitivity of young children to
the carcinogenic effect of X-radiation on the thyroid. The
reduction in the chance of developing thyroid tumours with
increasing age requires more observations for accurate
quantification but there is a considerable difference between
newborns and 10 year olds.  The observations also require
extension into the adolescent age group.  The reduction in
sensitivity with increasing age is also consistent with the lack
of any carcinogenic effect of iodine-131 treatment in adults with
thyrotoxicosis, although other factors are also likely to be
relevant.
<P>
Several thyroid-related effects of radiation other than cancer
are known to occur, of which the most obvious is the development
of hypothyroidism after exposure to large amounts of either
external or internal radiation. A study supported by the Sasakawa
Foundation found that both nodularity and hypothyroidism were
more frequent in Gomel, the area with the greatest exposure to
fallout, while other conditions not related to radiation occurred
at a broadly similar frequency in all five areas studied.  This
suggests that radiation may be linked to a high frequency of
nodularity and hypothyroidism in Gomel.
<P>
The evidence presented shows clearly that there has been a major
increase in histologically confirmed thyroid cancers in children
in Belarus and Ukraine since the Chernobyl accident. A smaller
increase has probably occurred in the Bryansk Oblast in Russia,
but firm population-based evidence on the incidence of confirmed
cases of childhood thyroid cancer is needed. The diagnosis of
thyroid cancer has been confirmed in well over 90% of over 250
cases in both Belarus and Ukraine in an international
co-operative study.
<P>
The evidence that the increase in thyroid cancer is related to
isotopes of iodide present in fallout is strong but indirect. So
far, no firm evidence is available of any major increase in any
malignancy other than thyroid cancer in the population exposed to
high levels of fallout.  Increases in the incidence in a range of
tumours have been reported, the scale of the increase is very
much less than in the thyroid; the size of the reported increase
is in the range which may make it difficult to separate a true
exposure-related increase from an effect of better reporting and
increased ascertainment.
<P>
It is clear that no other tumour has shown an increase in
frequency comparable to that seen in the thyroid. This makes it
highly likely that exposure to radioactive isotopes of iodine is
responsible for the thyroid cancer increase.  Radioistopes of
iodine are known to have been present in high levels in the
fallout; they are very greatly concentrated in the thyroid gland,
so that the radiation exposure in the gland is many times that of
other tissues. Absolute proof of the causal relationship between
exposure to radioiodine and the development of thyroid cancer is
not available, but the circumstantial evidence is very strong,
and no other plausible explanation for the increase is available.
<P>
It is not possible to predict with certainty whether the relative
high risk for the development of thyroid cancer will remain at
its present figure; more than five years of observation are
needed. It is possible that follicular carcinomas have a longer
latent period than papillary carcinomas, and that they may
increase in incidence in later years.  Evidence from external
radiation suggests that the relative risk increases up to 20
years after exposure, then declines. But an increased risk is
still present at 40 years after exposure and it would be prudent
to make this assumption when considering the likely future rates
of occurrence of thyroid carcinomas in the exposed population.
<P>
If the future risk is estimated on the basis of present trends in
the exposed areas using a relative risk model, then the incidence
of those exposed as children in Gomel will be about 200 times
that of the United Kingdom.  There are many uncertainties, and an
exact prediction of the expected numbers of thyroid carcinomas in
the future is not possible. However, it would be prudent for
advance planning of screening and health care to consider that a
large increase is a possible outcome.
<P>
Thyroid carcinoma in adults is in most cases a tumour of
relatively low malignancy, causing death in only a minority of
cases.  It is rather more aggressive in very young children, and
a long follow-up period is needed.  The number seen in Belarus
and Ukraine constitutes a major challenge, both for treatment and
for our understanding of the relationship between exposure to
fallout from a nuclear accident and the subsequent development of
malignancy. 
<P>
The increased susceptibility of very young children to the
subsequent development of thyroid carcinoma needs further study,
but it may be possible to target screening to the cohorts most at
risk.

<H2>Health effects</H2>
<B><I>Report by Dr. Fred A. Mettler, University of New Mexico,
United States, who served as Chairman of Topical Session 1: 
"Clinically observed effects".  This report reviews the health
hazards as investigated by the International Chernobyl Project,
which was conducted in 1990.</I></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The International Chernobyl Project (ICP) was conducted during
1990 about four and a half years after the accident. The health
effects portion of the project represented the combined effort of
about 100 physicians and scientists from 12 countries. The
project was difficult due to the very large area of heavy
contamination that extended for hundreds of kilometres from the
reactor site. Ultimately, the project was designed using an
age-matched cohort comparison from nearby uncontaminated
settlements.
<P>
The ICP was specifically designed to study issues related to
persons still living on highly contaminated territories. These
persons were continuing to receive radiation exposure and there
were pressing issues related to intervention and potential dose
reduction. It was well known that there were hundreds of
thousands of emergency workers who had been exposed, but in 1990
there was no possibility for dose reduction in these groups. Both
the International Red Cross and the World Health Organization had
sent health assessment teams to the area in 1988-89. These were
relatively small projects, but reached essentially the same
conclusions as the ICP did. 
<P>
There have been a number of publications relative to the ICP,
including brief summaries and overviews. The Technical Report is
more than 500 pages. Its extensive scientific explanation,
limited availability, and price have undoubtedly deterred many
people from actually reading it. Summaries are the most commonly
available literature on this project and it is these that have
been read by the public and media. Persons with a serious
interest in this subject, however, should obtain and read the
Technical Report that was approved by the project's International
Advisory Committee.<A HREF="#note_1">*</A>
<P>
It is important to examine the specific findings of the ICP
health effects group and see how they have held up in light of an
additional five years of research which was presented at the
International Chernobyl Conference in April 1996.
<P>
The health effects group collected extensive data on a number of
concerns expressed by local physicians.  A few examples of issues
that we were able to address and bring to closure are given here.
While there were children with anaemia, there was not a
difference between clean and contaminated settlements. Lead
poisoning was a concern of many parents as a result of potential
emission of materials dumped on the destroyed reactor. Children
in all villages had blood lead levels which were generally lower
than those normally found in Western Europe and the United
States. These and a number of other ICP findings have since been
corroborated by other groups.
<P>
With regard to immune issues, it was clear in 1990 that overall
lymphocyte levels were not affected. In the ICP Technical Report,
it was stated that "the independent medical team remains unable
to state absolutely that there are not some subtle immunological
changes in the population; however, if there are such changes
they appear to be of little clinical importance." While some
papers about immunological abnormalities were proffered to the
Chernobyl Conference in April 1996, these were at significant
variance with each other, both in terms of their findings and the
time course. While there have been claims in the media of
"Chernobyl AIDS", there were no papers nor was there a general
consensus at the Conference to support this concept.
<P>
The ICP concluded  in 1990 that there were significant
non-radiation related health disorders in both control and
contaminated settlements. Between 10% to 15% of persons examined
were in need of prompt medical treatment. Hypertension and dental
care were pointed out to be major public health problems. This
has been supported by subsequent work of other groups. In the
last five years, the average life-span in most of the former
Soviet Union has decreased due to non-radiation related health
problems such as stroke, heart disease, accidents, suicide, and
alcoholism.
<P>
The ICP health effects teams spent the majority of their effort
on children. Up to 1990, fetal malformation data did not show
evidence of a significant radiation related increase. Comments
and papers presented at the 1996 Chernobyl Conference about this
emotional issue indicated that while most scientific groups feel
that there has been no radiation-related increase, there still
are some persons who feel that there has been an effect.
<P>
Psychological investigations of the ICP showed that up to 90% of
persons living in contaminated settlements thought they had, or
might have, an illness due to radiation exposure. Interesting
enough, in clean settlements the comparable percentage was 75%.
The psychological issues were summarized in the Technical Report
by stating that, "The psychological problems related to Chernobyl
are major. Most of the people have genuine concerns and are not
acting in an irrational fashion, given their circumstances."
These findings have since been corroborated by many scientific
groups and the many speakers at the 1996 Chernobyl Conference
concluded that this remains the major health effect today.
<P>
Obviously there were (and still are) concerns about thyroid
problems. This related primarily to thyroid enlargement, nodules,
and cancer. In 1990, about 3% of children were found by palpation
to have enlarged thyroids and 0.5% had nodules. But there was no
statistical difference between clean and contaminated areas.
Papers presented in the last five years and proffered to the 1996
Chernobyl Conference indicate little consensus about whether
there is now an increase in thyroid nodules.
<P>
A major portion of the ICP was directed toward estimation of
future health effects,  particularly leukaemia and cancer. A 1990
review of health data showed that cancer had been increasing each
year, both before and after the accident. The rate of increase
appeared to be stable. The incidence of cancer has continued to
increase at about the same rate in the last five years but the
major cause of recent reduction in lifespan has not been due to
cancer.
<P>
Thyroid cancer was a major concern in 1990. In the Technical
Report (page 510), we stated that "available data reviewed did
not provide an adequate basis for determining whether there had
been an increase in leukaemia or thyroid cancers as a consequence
of the accident. The data were not detailed enough to exclude the
possibility of an increase in the incidence of some tumour
types."
<P>
The health effects group also was asked to estimate future and
lifetime health effects. Since we did not know the exact doses
for each of the thousands of contaminated settlements nor the
number of persons in each, the ICP gave an example of a
representative settlement and what the expected consequences
might be. We used a hypothetical settlement of 10,000 persons
with a dose from external radiation of 0.1 Sv over 70 years.  In
such a typical village, we predicted that thyroid cancers would
almost double, that there would be about a 40% increase in
leukaemia, and about a 3% increase in all cancer deaths over 70
years. The ICP Technical Report stated that "most of the thyroid
cancers would be expected to occur in children because of their
larger absorbed thyroid dose, longer lifespan, and increased
sensitivity relative to adults" and that "with the large release
of radioiodine during the accident, it is expected that there
will be a radiogenic excess of thyroid cancer cases in the
decades to come. This risk relates to thyroid doses received in
the first months after the accident."
<P>
The ICP also indicated that "reported estimates of thyroid dose
in children are such that there may be a statistically detectable
increase in the incidence of thyroid tumours in the future" and
that "certain high risk groups (such as children with high
absorbed thyroid doses) will need specific medical programs based
on their potential risks."  We did point out that with limited
resources, it would be too costly and impractical to follow all
persons who were exposed and that the concept of WHO to
concentrate on combined international studies for high-risk
populations should be endorsed. This recommendation has not come
to pass and there remain multiple competing scientific
investigations that cover identical issues, particularly related
to thyroid cancer and leukaemia.
<P>
In summary, the International Chernobyl Project represented an
historic event. It was an unprecedented international effort with
co-operation between scientists, physicians, and just plain
people. The health effects group findings helped focus attention
to areas of importance. The subtitle of the 1996 Chernobyl
Conference was "Summing Up the Consequences of the Accident".
There is the implication that the issue is finished. It is clear
from the atomic bomb survivor data that any final summary of
consequences from large radiation exposures of a population will
take at least five decades and not just one decade to complete.
Effects in children and psychological issues will remain at the
forefront.

<H2>Long-term health effects</H2>
<B><I>Report by E. Cardis, International Agency for Research on
Cancer, France, who served as Scientific Secretary of Topical
Session 3: "Longer-term effects", Prof. A.E. Okeanov, Centre for
Medical Technology, Belarus, who served as the Session's

<HR>
<P>
If the experience of the survivors of the Japan atomic bombing
and of other exposed populations is applicable, the major
expected radiological impact of the Chernobyl accident will be
deaths from cancer. The total lifetime numbers of excess cancer
deaths will be greatest among the "liquidators" (emergency and
recovery workers employed in 1986-87) and among the residents of
"contaminated" territories. Any estimate of this excess is very
unclear because of uncertainties in individual doses and in the
exact magnitude of effects of low-dose protracted radiation
exposure. Currently, however, our best estimates are: some 2000
extra cancer deaths lifetime among almost 200,000 liquidators
from 1986 and 1987; and 4600 deaths among some 6.8 million
residents of contaminated territories. Increases of this
magnitude would be extremely difficult to detect
epidemiologically against an expected background number of 41,500
and 800,000 cancer deaths, respectively, among the two groups.
<P>
On the basis of the data from other populations exposed to
radiation, the major radiological impact expected to date (i.e.
within the first ten years after the accident) is leukaemia. The
increase is mainly expected among liquidators; indeed, if the
experience of the atomic bomb survivors is applicable, the
increase in this population should be detectable
epidemiologically. Increases in leukaemia among liquidators have
been reported, but they are not consistent. They are, moreover,
difficult to interpret: the cases have not all been verified yet
and the increases may reflect the effect of increased
surveillance of the liquidators and under-registration of cases
in the population in countries where systematic centralized
cancer registration was limited at the time of the Chernobyl
accident. No consistent increase has been reported to date.
However, the present reports concern only a two-year period and
the ability to detect such an increase is much reduced.
<P>
Increases in thyroid cancer among those exposed as children were
observed in the more heavily contaminated regions of Belarus,
Ukraine, and Russia, at rates much higher than predicted from
previous studies. These increases may reflect either particular
sensitivity of the population, due to host or environmental
factors; or under-estimation of doses to the thyroid; or a higher
carcinogenic potential of very short-lived iodine isotopes.
Increases in thyroid cancer are now also reported among
liquidators and the general population; for reasons mentioned
above, these must, however, be verified before attributing them
to the Chernobyl accident. 
<P>
There is a tendency to attribute fluctuations and/or increases in
cancer rates over time to the Chernobyl accident. It should,
however, be noted that increases in the incidence of several
neoplasms have been observed in some countries in the last
decades, prior to the accident. A general increase in mortality
has been reported in recent years in many regions of the former
USSR which does not appear to be related to radiation levels.
This must be taken into account when interpreting the results of
studies.
<P>
Increases in the frequency of a number of non-specific
detrimental health effects other than cancer among exposed
populations, particularly among liquidators, have been reported.
It is difficult to interpret these findings because exposed
populations undergo a much more intensive and active health
follow-up than the general population.
<P>
Based on results of animal experiments, it is possible that in
addition to cancers, a small increase in hereditary disorders may
occur following radiation exposure. On the basis of these data,
the predicted occurrence of genetic effects induced by radiation
from the accident would be very low, ranging from 0 to 0.03% of
all live births and from less than 0.1% to 0.4% of all genetic
disorders among the live births to the exposed population.
<P>
When considering predictions of the likely health effects of
radiation from the Chernobyl accident, it is important to
recognize that the current estimates of doses to exposed
populations are uncertain; in particular, doses received early
after the accident are not well known. The exposures received by
populations due to the Chernobyl accident are, moreover,
different (in type and pattern) from those of the survivors of
the atomic bombing of Japan. Predictions derived from studies of
those populations are therefore uncertain. Although an increase
in thyroid cancer in children as a result of the Chernobyl
accident was envisaged, the extent of the increase was not
foreseen. Only ten years have passed since the accident, and on
the basis of epidemiological studies of other populations, any
increases in the incidence of cancers other than leukaemia are
usually not visible until at least ten years after exposure.
Therefore it is essential that monitoring the health of the
population be continued to assess the public health impact of the
accident, even if an increase in cancers caused by radiation from
Chernobyl (except leukaemia among liquidators and thyroid cancer)
may be difficult to detect.
<P>
Epidemiological studies of selected populations and diseases are
also needed in order to study observed or predicted effects;
careful studies may in particular provide important information
on the effect of exposure rate and exposure type in the low to
medium dose range and on factors which may modify radiation
effects. As such, they may have important consequences for the
radiation protection of patients and of the general population in
the event of any future accidental exposure. Both cohort and case
control studies are generally much more powerful than descriptive
studies for investigating dose relationships. To be informative,
however, studies of the consequences of the Chernobyl accident
must fulfill several important criteria: they must cover very
large numbers of exposed subjects; the follow-up must be complete
and non-selective; and precise and accurate individual dose
estimates (or markers of exposure) must be available. In
particular, the feasibility and the quality of epidemiological
studies largely depend on the existence and the quality of basic
population-based registers, and on the feasibility of linking
information on a single individual from different data sources.
<P>
In conclusion, ten years after the Chernobyl accident, there is,
apart from the dramatic increase in thyroid cancer in those
exposed as children, no evidence of a major public health impact
to date of radiation exposure as a result of the Chernobyl
accident in the three most affected countries. No major increase
in all cancer incidence or mortality has been observed that could
be attributed to the accident. In particular, no major increase
has been detected in rates of leukaemia - even among liquidators
- one of the major concerns after radiation exposure. This is
generally consistent with predictions based on studies of other
radiation-exposed populations, in particular the survivors of the
atomic bombings in Japan.

<H2>Agricultural countermeasures</H2>
<B><I>Report by John I. Richards, Head of the FAO/IAEA
Agriculture and Biotechnology Laboratory at the IAEA's
Seibersdorf Laboratories, who was a designated FAO participant at
the International Chernobyl Conference, and Raymond J. Hance,
Head of the Agrochemicals and Residues Section of the Joint
FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and
Agriculture.</I></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
One of the lessons of Chernobyl is that farming is vulnerable to
the effects of a nuclear accident hundreds, even thousands, of
miles away from the site. Therefore plans are needed for
countermeasures that can reduce contamination of agricultural
produce, regardless of whether or not a country has its own
nuclear programme. The primary aims of such plans should be to
minimize radioactive contamination of crops and animal products
and return the land to productive use as far as, and as soon as,
possible. These aims must balance the costs to governments with
the benefits to human health, and the disruption to daily life
with the well-being of communities. The plans need to specify
radiation levels for foods and feedstuffs at which intervention
is necessary and to include a range of countermeasures to be
taken to protect agriculture under a range of possible
post-accident situations.
<P>
Criteria for setting intervention levels have been established
internationally. In general, food legislation prohibits unsafe
levels of contamination and does not distinguish between
contaminants whether they are pesticide residues, heavy metals,
mycotoxins, pathogenic microorganisms, or radionuclides. At low
levels of contamination, where the risk to health is low or
difficult to eliminate altogether, contaminant levels are set
which allow for foods to be sold, bought, and consumed. The
limits must be unambiguous so that they can be easily understood
by all concerned in administering them.
<P>
The FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission has developed
international standards for radionuclide contamination to be
applied to food moving in international trade. <A
HREF="box3.html"><I>(See table.)</I></A> Many countries have
adopted these in their national legislation, not least because
internationally recognized intervention levels help to maintain
credibility, confidence, and trust in national authorities and
prevent anomalies that might otherwise occur along borders of
neighbouring countries. In addition Codex standards will be
applied by the World Trade Organization.
<P>
The levels are based on a number of conservative assumptions in
order to be confident that there will be essentially no effect
over a lifetime of exposure. Hence, if alternative food is not
available, higher values would be acceptable in the short term.
On the other hand, lower levels may be appropriate, for example
if external radiation makes a high contribution to the total
dose.
<P>
Against this background it can be seen that an important purpose
of agricultural countermeasures is to maximize the quantity of
food produced which passes intervention criteria.
<H3>Agricultural countermeasures</H3>
The Joint FAO/IAEA programme on nuclear techniques in food and
agriculture has approached agricultural countermeasures in three
ways. The first was to bring together as much as possible of the
information and experience acquired after the Chernobyl accident
in order to prepare guidelines for agricultural countermeasures.
The second was to assist affected Member States to develop and
implement particular countermeasures. The third was to support
work to generate data that can be used to refine existing
countermeasures or develop new ones.
<P>
<B><I>Guidelines for Agricultural Countermeasures Following an
Accidental Release of Radionuclides (IAEA Technical Reports
Series No. 363, 1994).</I></B> The Chernobyl accident stimulated
considerable scientific research and much practical experience
was obtained by those dealing with its consequences. This
document, prepared by nearly 40 scientists from 19 countries,
summarizes the information generated. It aims to give general
advice on the development of emergency response plans. The main
elements are a general strategy for the introduction of
agricultural countermeasures, a review of available
countermeasures for use in decision-making, and guidance for the
preparation of specific national guidelines. (A Russian
translation of the document is available as IAEA TECDOC-745.)
<P>
The effectiveness of measures taken to protect the agricultural
sector (people, land, crops and livestock) from the effect of a
nuclear accident depends on plans prepared in advance. The
<I>Guidelines</I> outline a strategy for the development of such
emergency plans which should not only specify criteria for taking
prompt short-term action but also criteria for longer term action
which will do much to sustain public confidence in the competence
and integrity of the authorities.
<P>
The <I>Guidelines</I> recognize two distinct phases in which to
consider countermeasures. In the planning and preparation of
responses to an accident, possible protective actions should be
assessed in a general way in relation to a range of credible
accident scenarios. From this, the first criteria for action to
be used immediately and for a short time after an accident can be
developed. These plans require a database which includes
information about the transfer of the radioisotopes of caesium
and strontium between local soil, water, plants, animals, and
fish. These are the isotopes most likely to cause more than
transient problems to agriculture. In addition, data on soils,
weather patterns, local dietary preferences, and some feasible
countermeasures with estimates of their costs should be included.
A network of laboratories for radionuclide analysis must also be
identified.
<P>
The second phase begins some time after a real accident has
happened when specific information on its nature and likely
consequences is available. Specific protective measures can then
be considered. However, in many cases the choice of
countermeasures will be constrained by social factors and
infrastructure of the region, so it is important that the
database for decision-making includes this information too.
<P>
The <I>Guidelines</I> then go on to consider particular
agricultural countermeasures with some assessment of their
efficacy. Such countermeasures address long-term health effects
in the human population; the more immediate impact of radiation
exposure on plant and animal life is not directly considered.
<P>
Some measures can be taken before and during deposition of
radioactive fallout, such as housing animals and covering
feed/food stores. Given adequate warning, it may be possible to
harvest a crop (grass, grain, cash crop) before deposition
occurs.
<P>
Countermeasures applied during the first few weeks after
deposition are concerned particularly with reducing exposure from
short-lived radionuclides such as iodine-131. Thus, crops may be
harvested and stored, or harvesting may be delayed, to allow for
radioactive decay before consumption. Similarly, milk
contaminated with iodine-131 can be converted to storable
products (e.g. milk powder, cheese).
<P>
Once radioactive contamination is distributed through the
biosphere, a wider range of countermeasures needs to come into
play which takes into consideration the transfer of the relevant
radionuclides from soils into the food chain. For example, since
mineral uptake by plants is related to the total available and
relative abundance of their different ions, the application of
high levels of potassium fertilizer can reduce radiocaesium
uptake; and liming, by increasing calcium levels can reduce
radiostrontium uptake. Sometimes it is possible to use
alternative crops or varieties that accumulate lower levels of
radionuclides than those normally grown in a region - for
example, cereals in place of leafy vegetables and pasture.
Another possibility is to grow crops such as sugar-beet or
oilseed rape where the edible product is processed and
contamination reduced. In order to maintain some form of
agriculture wherever possible, the production of non-food crops
such as flax and cotton for fibre, oilseed for  lubricants or
biofuel, and ornamental plants must be considered. Finally,
burying the contaminated surface of the land by deep ploughing
can be an effective procedure for large farms provided the proper
ploughs are available.
<P>
Contamination of animal products can be reduced most effectively
by limiting their  intake of radionuclides or reducing their
absorbtion. Feeding uncontaminated stored feedstuffs is an
example of the first category while the use of Prussian Blue
(discussed in more detail later) is an example of the latter. In
the case of meat-producing animals, feeding uncontaminated feed
may only be necessary close to the time of slaughter since the
biological half-life of radiocaesium, for example, is of the
order of two to four weeks depending on the species. Ideally this
should be supplemented by monitoring live animals in the
slaughterhouse or at the farm to identify those that require a
further period of feeding with uncontaminated feed. With game
animals, changing the hunting season may be effective where the
animals have seasonal feeding habits.  For example, mushrooms and
lichens, which can be highly contaminated, are frequently most
abundant in the autumn, so animals should not be hunted during
this period.
<P>
These are merely examples of countermeasures; there are many more
possibilities. However, decisions on whether to apply
countermeasures and which ones are appropriate require
information about the nature and extent of radioactive
contamination. As a considerable infrastructure is necessary to
produce an effective response, a large section of the
<I>Guidelines</I> is concerned with organizational structures.
Finally, the document briefly reviews the responses of selected
countries to the Chernobyl accident.
<H3>Assistance with countermeasures in contaminated areas</H3>
<A HREF="box4.html"><I>Effects of countermeasures on caesium-137
levels in milk and meat</I></A>
<P>
The application of many different countermeasures in Belarus,
Ukraine, and western Russia following the Chernobyl accident led
to a significant reduction in radiocaesium contamination of milk
and meat produced on State and collective farms. However, many of
the countermeasures were difficult to apply by small-scale
farmers for economic reasons. In 1990 up to 50,000 dairy cows
were still producing milk that exceeded temporary permissible
levels, or TPLs, (111 Bq/L in Belarus; 370 Bq/L in Ukraine and
Russia). Therefore, an alternative approach was required which
was simple, effective, and cheap.
<P>
A project sponsored by the Norwegian Government developed a
countermeasure to lower the levels of radiocaesium in both
domesticated and game ruminants using a mixture of compounds
known as "Prussian Blue" (PB). Executed through the United
Nations, the project involved the Norwegian Agricultural
University and Radiation Hygiene Institute, the Ukrainian
Research Institute of Agricultural Radiology in Kiev, the
Belarussian Branch of the All-Union Institute of Agricultural
Radiology in Obninsk, and Queen's University, Belfast. The IAEA's
Seibersdorf Laboratories, the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear
Techniques in Food and Agriculture, and the IAEA's Division of
Nuclear Safety provided co-ordination, expert services,
equipment, and materials to the major counterpart institutes in
three countries for conducting trials in the worst affected
villages.
<P>
Successful trials were conducted in 1990-92 involving over 3,000
cows in 21 settlements in Belarus, 10,000 cows in 54 settlements
in the Ukraine, and an unspecified number of cattle in villages
in Russia. Thereafter, each State's Minister of Agriculture
authorized the widespread use of PB in livestock for reducing the
content of caesium-137 in milk and meat.
<P>
The term "Prussian Blue" refers to a number of ferric hexacyano
ferrates; ammonium ferric cyanoferrate (or AFCF) is perhaps the
most commonly used caesium-binding compound. Given as a bolus
into the rumen, in compounded concentrate feed, in salt licks, or
simply sprinkled on the diet, AFCF reacts with consumed
radiocaesium in the intestine to form a complex that is
eliminated in the dung instead of passing into the animal's blood
stream. The PB bound radiocaesium in dung is only slowly
available to plants. Depending on the dose and type of PB
compound given, radiocaesium reductions of two to eight times can
be achieved in milk and meat from cattle grazing contaminated
fodder. This significantly reduces the internal dose to the human
consumer and is often enough to allow village communities to
remain in contaminated areas. As a result, the need to
translocate whole communities, with its attendant traumas, has
been curtailed and huge costs have been averted. Not
surprisingly, the benefits of employing PB compounds have been
greatly welcomed by farmers and government alike.
<P>
While successful countermeasures have been applied on state and
collective farms and foodstuffs with acceptably low radionuclide
content are now grown on previously contaminated land, public
acceptance of "clean" foods coming from these areas is still a
problem. The Belarussian and Ukrainian authorities are thus
anxious to use this land in other ways. Through its joint
programme with Food and Agricultural Organisation, the IAEA's
Technical Co-operation Department is currently supporting a
project in Belarus to investigate the potential of oil seed crops
(primarily rapeseed) as an alternative crop. Initial research
indicates that oil produced from certain varieties of rapeseed on
land with radiocaesium levels of 15-40 Ci/km<SUP>2</SUP> is
devoid of the radionuclide (and radiostrontium); the
contamination is restricted to the straw and residual oil seed
meal. The Belarus authorities sowed about 20,000 hectares of
contaminated land with rapeseed in 1995 and intend refining the
oil into lubricants which currently have to be imported. Should
the project be successful, the land area sown will be expanded
two- to threefold for lubricant production.
<P>
IAEA assistance is also being given to Ukraine to improve the
skills and facilities for the measurement, control, and
consequently the reduction of radionuclides in foodstuffs. The
programme is based on the Ovruch Milk Canning Integrated Works
which processes 200-500 tons of milk per day, much of it from
farms within the Chernobyl contaminated zone. The United States
government is currently providing additional resources to assess
a commercial magnetic separation system for decontaminating
liquid milk.
<P>
<B><I>Generation of data.</I></B> Belarus is receiving assistance
through the IAEA Technical Co-operation programme to obtain more
data on the occurrence and migration of radionuclides in soils,
forests, and water bodies. These will be used in forecasts of the
likelihood of success and of the time required for the
restoration of contaminated regions to normal economic activity.
<P>
<A HREF="box5.html"><I>Summary of benefits of using Prussian Blue
compounds</I></A>
<P>
<H3>Applying lessons learned</H3>
Values for the transfer of radionuclides between different
components of the biosphere and experience in dealing with the
consequences of a nuclear accident are largely confined to
temperate regions, primarily in Europe. However, there are
nuclear power stations in some parts of the world that could
conceivably affect tropical countries in the event of an
accident. Therefore, a Co-ordinated Research Programme (CRP)
involving the IAEA Division of Radiation and Waste Safety and the
Joint FAO/IAEA Division is in progress to measure transfer
factors for radiocaesium and radiostrontium from soil to major
tropical crops and also from water to tropical fish. These data
will be of value for both planning countermeasures and for
establishing permissible levels of radionuclides in industrial
effluents in the tropics. There are also plans to establish a
further CRP which will examine the efficacy in tropical
conditions of countermeasures that have proved effective in
Europe.
<P>
In devising and applying agricultural countermeasures, more
consideration should be given to the management of the whole
contaminated environment, especially forests and water bodies
because of the interactions between them and agricultural land.
There is a need to develop secondary reference levels (so-called
"operational intervention levels") for animal feeds and pasture.
This requires additional data on transfer factors or at least
re-examination of existing knowledge.
<P>
A range of agricultural countermeasures is currently available to
reduce the impact of radiocaesium contamination in the food
chain. The same cannot be said for radiostrontium contamination.
Considerable laboratory and field research and development are
required to improve the situation. For example, a number of
materials have been proposed for selectively absorbing/adsorbing
strontium in foodstuffs but none can yet be recommended
unequivocally because data are inadequate. Alternative
approaches,  such as filters and magnetic separators for liquid
food products, are currently available commercially although they
have not been evaluated critically under the conditions
prevailing in the contaminated regions.
<P>
To conclude, the Chernobyl accident highlighted the need for each
country to develop a set of agricultural countermeasures ready
for immediate application in the event of a nuclear accident.
Lessons have been learned on the usefulness of many
countermeasures and the infrastructures needed to implement them.
Work remains to be done to ensure that these lessons are applied.
This is particularly important for tropical environments as most
of our experience has been obtained in temperate climates.

Bulletin Vol. 38/3 Nuclear safety aspects

<BODY>
<H2>Nuclear safety aspects</H2>
<B><I>Report by Luis Lederman, Acting Head of the Safety
Assessment Section in the IAEA Department of Nuclear Safety, who
served as Scientific Secretary of Topical Session 7:  "Nuclear
safety remedial measures".</I></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
From 1-3 April 1996 an International Forum "One Decade After
Chernobyl: Nuclear Safety Aspects" was convened at the IAEA in
Vienna, Austria. It was organized by the IAEA in co-operation
with the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA). The
objective was to review the remedial measures taken since the
Chernobyl accident to improve the safety of RBMK reactors and the
Chernobyl containment structure (sarcophagus). The results were
presented at the International Conference on Chernobyl held in
the following week. 
<P>
This article features excerpts of the conclusions of the Safety
Forum related to the safety of Chernobyl-type reactors (RBMKs)
and to conditions at the site of the Chernobyl plant itself.
<H3>Causes of the accident</H3>
The events which led to the accident in Unit 4 of the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant on 26 April 1986 have been investigated by
many teams of scientists over the past ten years. Although there
are still some gaps in knowledge relating to details of some
phenomena involved in the accident, the knowledge acquired is
sufficient to identify the causes and to take effective measures
to prevent a repetition of such an event.  
<P>
From today's viewpoint the main causes of the accident can be
summarized as follows:  
<P>
<UL>
<LI>severe deficiencies in the reactor's physical design and in
the design of the shutdown facilities; 
<P>
<LI>high positive void effect during operational conditions with
high burn-up; 
<P>
<LI>positive scram effect under conditions of the reactor before
the accident; 
<P>
<LI>failure to incorporate the operating reactivity margin (ORM)
into reactor protection; 
<P>
<LI>lack of safety culture in the responsible organizations
leading to the inability to remedy important weaknesses, even
though they had been known long before the accident; 
<P>
<LI>an insufficiently reasoned and examined test programme with
respect to technical safety; 
<P>
<LI>violation of operating procedures; 
<P>
<LI>operation and operating equipment imposing undue requirements
on the responsible staff; 
<P>
<LI>insufficient protection against accidents beyond the design
basis.
</UL>
<H3>The safety of RBMKs</H3>
There is broad agreement that the original design of the RBMK
core and shutdown system had severe deficiencies. This holds for
all generations of RBMK plants. Between 1987 and 1991, a first
stage of safety upgrading was performed for all RBMK units
addressing the most serious problems in this area.  
<P>
The void reactivity effect has been reduced by installing 80-90
additional absorbers and by increasing the operative reactivity
margin up to 43-45 manual control rods, and by increasing the
fuel enrichment to 2.4%. 
<P>
The efficiency of the scram system has been increased by
elimination of water columns; increasing the number of bottom
control rods driven in the core together with the upper rods
after trip signals; the speed of rod insertion; a new fast-acting
shutdown system; and additional signals for the control and
safety system.  
<P>
Organization and operation has been strengthened by more frequent
computation and display of the operative reactivity margin; and
improved operating rules and procedures. Progress has also been
achieved in further areas, such as installation of remote
shutdown stations, non-destructive testing and training of
personnel (simulator). The realization of these measures varies
from plant to plant.  
<P>
There remain issues beyond the scope of the first stage of
upgrading which require further attention. These needs largely
depend on the different stages of RBMK development.  
<P>
There is no doubt that significant improvements were achieved
regarding the safety deficiencies relevant for the Chernobyl
accident. For other safety issues, safety upgrading is under way
or planned. The realization of this second stage of upgrading
continues to encounter major financial difficulties. That may be
characterized as an important if not the main current problem for
RBMK safety.  
<P>
<B>Remaining problems of RBMKs.</B> The analysis performed so far
shows that, from a technical point of view, the known safety
deficiencies of second and third generation RBMKs could be
overcome in a way broadly consistent with the defense-in-depth
concept. Many of the steps to be taken have been already defined
and internationally agreed.  
<P>
The practicability of backfitting first generation RBMKs raises
further questions in addition to the issues relevant for the
second and third generations of the plant. There have been
significant doubts in Western countries about the feasibility and
the cost effectiveness of backfits. However, from today's
perspective it must be recognized that the existing upgrading
programmes address most safety concerns. They include the
backfitting of essential safety features such as control and
protection systems, emergency core cooling systems, and partial
confinement. It is evident that they will lead to significant
improvements even if they will not always reproduce the technical
solutions implemented in the new RBMK plants. Where "classical"
approaches are difficult to implement, they often rely on
compensating solutions.  
<H3>Particular problems at Chernobyl</H3>
Most of the above considerations on RBMK safety also hold for the
Chernobyl plant. Nevertheless, the situation at Chernobyl is a
particular one as there exists a range of site specific problems.
These problems concern both the safety of the remaining units and
the accident consequences. 
<P>
Although there are plans to shut down the Chernobyl reactors in
the near future, programmes for upgrading them, that have been
agreed internationally, should be implemented to ensure safety
during their remaining lifetime. 
<P>
For the consequences of the accident, concerns focus on the
sarcophagus built around the destroyed reactor, on the
radioactive material contained inside the sarcophagus, and on the
radioactive material buried on the site. 
<P>
<B>The sarcophagus.</B> The possible instability of the
sarcophagus is a significant problem. The concern is mostly
related to the fact that essential supports of the main
construction had to be built by remote control without fixings
such as welding and bolt connections. As a consequence, there is
considerable uncertainty regarding the resistance to potential
internal and external impacts. This relates above all to the
withstanding of loads due to external burden or impact, such as
loads due to wind, snow, or earthquake, for example. There is
broad agreement that the risk of a partial or total collapse
during the initially projected design lifetime of the sarcophagus
of about 30 years is not negligible if no countermeasures are
taken.  
<P>
Even in the worst case of a complete collapse, widespread effects
are not to be expected. Nevertheless, the stabilization of the
sarcophagus is an issue of high priority.  
<P>
Water entering the sarcophagus is another significant safety
issue. The presence of water stimulates the disintegration of
fuel masses into dust and degradation of building structures by
corrosion, and can increase the reactivity of fuel masses.
Regarding the risk of groundwater contamination, the existence of
water in the sarcophagus bears some risk in the long term.
However, this risk is assumed to be much smaller than that from
contact of water with the radioactive material buried in the
ground outside the sarcophagus.  
<P>
Possibilities of recriticality have been widely investigated. It
has been found that the sarcophagus is currently safe from a
criticality point of view. Nevertheless, it cannot completely be
excluded that there exist configurations of fuel masses inside
the sarcophagus which could reach a critical state when in
contact with water. However, even if this could lead to
significant radiation fields inside the sarcophagus, neither
large off-site releases nor mechanical effects would have to be
apprehended in such an event. The impact on the operating
personnel of the other units should also be clarified. 
<P>
Another specific issue for the Chernobyl plant is the possible
implications for safety of the proximity of the sarcophagus and
the destroyed reactor to the adjoining operating Unit 3. The
risks are generally assumed to be low; however, the issue needs
further investigation.  (Note: Opinions differ widely about the
significance of the risk of an accident in Chernobyl Unit 3
caused by a collapse of the sarcophagus. More detailed
investigations of this issue are required.) 
<H3>Other site-specific problems</H3>
Further site-specific problems relate to the contamination, in
particular to the radioactive material buried at the site. The
type and extent of the contamination are well known by
measurements. Although the local dose rate is considerably high,
most areas are accessible. The provisional depositories of highly
radioactive material, such as nuclear fuel ejected out of the
reactor during the accident, however, represent an obstacle for
construction and reconstruction measures. Furthermore,
radioactive substances get into the groundwater there. At present
the contamination is still low. In the long term there is,
however, a considerable risk, and an orderly disposal of the
provisional depositories is absolutely required.  
<H3>Step-by-step site restoration</H3>
Given the scale of the problems to be solved at Chernobyl, it is
evident that major long-term efforts are needed. The stability of
the sarcophagus must be ensured, the destroyed reactor
permanently secured, the wastes disposed of, and the site
reconstructed. This will require substantial resources.  
<P>
There is a broad agreement that these problems call for an
integrated approach divided into suitable steps. This approach
should be based on realistic targets which take into account the
radiological conditions at the site and appropriate safety and
waste disposal priorities. It should begin with a stabilization
of the existing sarcophagus. That stabilization could
significantly reduce the risk of a collapse of the shelter and
provide time for a careful reflection and planning of further
measures, such as the construction of a new encasement and waste
management. This would include the recovery or partial recovery
of fuel masses inside the sarcophagus, and the disposal of
radioactive material buried on the site.

<STRONG>
WHAT IS PRIS
</STRONG>
<P>
<P>
Since 1970, the IAEA has been collecting and publishing data about the world's nuclear power plants. In order to facilitate the analysis of power plant performance and to produce relevant publications, the data were computerized in 1980, and the Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) was implemented. Since then, PRIS has been continuously updated and improved and it now constitutes the most complete data bank on nuclear power reactors in the world. It has been widely used and today constitutes an essential source of information on nuclear power.
<P>
PRIS covers two kinds of data: general and design information on power reactors, and information about operating experience with nuclear power plants. General and design information covers all reactors that are in operation, under construction, or shut-down in IAEA Member States, and in Taiwan, China. Data on operating experience  cover operational reactors, and historical data cover shutdown reactors, in IAEA Member States and in Taiwan, China. In these areas PRIS is considered the most complete and authoritative source of statistical data.
<P>
PRIS makes it possible to easily identify individual nuclear units and their main characteristics, and to determine nuclear power development status and trends worldwide, in regions, or in individual countries. Since 1990,  the  IAEA has compiled information on additional technical characteristics. It covers items related to the mode of plant operation, safety characteristics, safety features, existence of safety analysis reports and of emergency plans, and the plant environment, for example. This additional information on plant characteristics provides a better overview of plant design and mode of operation.
<P>
In order to assess plant performance, indicators are used. PRIS provides information on availability and unavailability factors, load factor, planned unavailability factor, and unplanned unavailability factors due to causes at the plant and externally.
<P>
Outage analysis provides indications on the reasons for a plant's unavailability. Statistical analysis, as well as studies of individual units or utilities, can provide indications about problem areas and what remedial actions and measures can be applied to achieve performance improvements. PRIS provides data in support of such analyses.
<P>
Originally,  PRIS data were stored using a generalized database management system called Adabas,  developed and marketed by Software AG, in Germany. This system used Natural query language to retrieve and process the PRIS data.
<P>
Recently, PRIS has been re-designed and downloaded to a LAN-based environment using client-server architecture for database systems. The database is now installed on Microsoft SQL server under an OS/2 operating environment. The primary objectives of the new design were to improve flexibility of data entry,  reduce complexity of relational operations required, and provide more user-friendly interfaces for database maintenance and users. The graphical user interface was developed using a front-end (client) tool, Object View, that runs using Microsoft Windows.
<P>
The new system contains two different interfaces, one for database maintenance and a second for data retrieval (the reporting system). Through the reporting system, the user can access detailed information about a country, its reactor sites and  nuclear power plants. It presents general and design information for a nuclear power plant, its yearly and monthly production, including performance factors and outages. It also presents information about national electricity production and national nuclear production. The system enables the user to make flexible queries using a set of selection criteria, and it presents tables or charts and enables data to be downloaded to any Windows application. The new system has been used at the IAEA since the beginning of 1995 and is scheduled to be released to IAEA Member States through dial-up or INTERNET  by the end of the year.
<P>
<STRONG>
PRIS PUBLICATIONS
</STRONG>
<P>
The PRIS database is used to produce two annual IAEA publications: Operating Experience with Nuclear Power Plants in Member States, published since 1971; and Nuclear Power Reactors in the World, Reference Data Series No.2, published since 1981
<P>
It also is used to provide material for other IAEA  publications. Statistical analysis are also carried out either for use within the IAEA or on request from Member States and outside organizations.
<P>
<STRONG>
PRIS SERVICES
</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>On-line Access</STRONG>. In 1989 the PRIS database was made available on-line for direct access via the international public data networks or public switched telephone system. This service, called PRIS On-line, was kept operating free of charge. Currently, about 70 users in 28 Member States and 4 international organizations have on-line access. This service will be improved with the release of the new system, which enables a direct connection to the PRIS data base under Windows through the INTERNET or through direct dial-up connection to the IAEA.
<P>
<STRONG>MicroPRIS</STRONG>. In parallel with the on-line access system, the Agency has offered  MicroPRIS to Member States, free of charge, since January 1991. This is a personal computer (PC) version of data available on diskette in a form readily accessible by standard, commercially available PC packages. Currently, there are about 200 organizations  in 54 Member States and 8 international organizations using  MicroPRIS.
<P>
<STRONG>
AD-HOC Requests
</STRONG>
<P>
As noted earlier, PRIS is extensively used in the IAEA as a data source for various IAEA publications and papers.
<P>
Additionally, PRIS staff respond to requests from IAEA Member States ranging from simple queries to complicated analyses. These requests typically are answered by sending data sets as computer printouts on diskettes or magnetic tapes.
<P>
<STRONG>
HOW TO ORDER PRIS SERVICES
</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>PRIS On-line</STRONG>. The IAEA PRIS on-line access has been granted to Member States free of charge until further notice. To get the PRIS on-line access a Subscription Form must be completed and sent to the IAEA.  The access authorization is accomplished through the issuance of a password by the IAEA to its Member States and International Member Organizations.

Cattle normally play a crucial role in rural economies of
developing countries, providing crop manure, domestic fuel and
hides, as well as meat and milk, while the bullock is the tractor
in the field and the engine of transportation. But in a wide belt
across central and southern Africa and on Zanzibar's main island
Unguja, livestock rearing is seriously hampered because the
tsetse fly spreads disease to the animals. Numerous costly
efforts to eradicate tsetse - using traps, insecticides, and
other conventional methods - have failed thus far. Now it seems
that eradication is possible, at least on isolated Zanzibar.
<P>
<I>Unguja and a few tiny satellite islands make up Zanzibar, 35
kilometres east of continental Africa. It joined the United
Republic of Tanzania in 1964. A lone fly species lives on Unguja.
Apart from it, the island has ideal conditions for cattle - lush
vegetation, gently undulating terrain, reliable and ample
rainfall. Yet some 10,000 live animals plus US$250,000 of milk
products must be imported each year to supplement the low per
capita intake of protein on Unguja.</I>
<P>
Tsetse flies (<I>Glossina</I> species) live only on blood. Some
species carry sleeping sickness to humans, others a similar
disease, <I>nagana</I>, to animals caused by single celled
organisms called trypanosomes. The single species (G.
<I>austeni</I>) on the island attacks only animals. Nagana, first
reported in Unguja early this century, has restricted and ravaged
the 1,650 square kilometre island's herds and until recently up
to 80% of the remaining cattle were infected. 
<P>
Initial efforts to eradicate the fly-using environmentally
friendly methods-began over 20 years ago with a research
programme in mainland Tanzania funded by the US Agency for
International Development. A laboratory and facilities for
mass-rearing of tsetses were introduced at Tanga. Significant
experience was gained in this effort but it eventually proved
unsustainable. Since then a series of activities on Zanzibar
involving bilateral and multilateral assistance have used
conventional methods to substantially reduce fly numbers and
contain their movement. 
<P>
Conditions thus seemed promising for eradication when the IAEA
Model Project was launched in 1994. Fly density had been
drastically reduced, in some areas to levels below detectability
by trap surveys. Re-infestation was unlikely because it is far
from the mainland. The tsetse fly reservoirs in Unguja were
mainly in three forests in the south; and a broad enough belt of
mainly rice paddies separated these from the north of the island.
New techniques developed in projects against other pest insects,
such as aerial release, could be introduced on Zanzibar.
<P>
The IAEA Model Project is relying on SIT, the Sterile Insect
Technique, to mass-rear and release sterilized male flies in
sufficient numbers to challenge the fertile wild males as mates
for the wild females. SIT is well advanced and has been
effectively used against fruitflies in both North and South
America. But its application against other insects, such as the
tsetse, is an innovation being fostered in the Technical
Co-operation Programme with the support of the Joint FAO/IAEA
Division.
<P>
After just two years of sterile male releases, females routinely
caught in the wild already show a high ratio of infertility,
expected to reach 65% in the first quarter of this year. Major
advances are being made (<A HREF="sitbox.htm">see box</A>) in
rearing and sex
identification systems. To promote the approach the IAEA convened
a four-week SIT training course/seminar in Unguja late in 1995
for scientists from other African countries affected by tsetse.
<P>
The Agency first got involved in helping Zanzibar back in 1983
with the training of Tanzanian scientists at IAEA's Seibersdorf
laboratory in mass rearing the Unguja tsetse species, using a
<I>membrane</I> feeding technique developed there. Facilities in
Tanga were systematically improved and extended so that by the
end of 1995, with a colony of 400,000 females, it housed the
world's largest tsetse production system. The colony will soon be
500,000, allowing for the release of 50,000 (60,000 with back-up
from Seibersdorf) sterile males each week. Thanks to the support
of several donors, the project is well on its way toward a
successful conclusion.
<P>
To rebuild Zanzibar's herds of mixed livestock, family based
farming is now being expanded. Farmers in areas that were until
recently infested now have the opportunity to obtain cattle
through a government programme offering very attractive loans.
Government initiatives to inspire family-based herds, in a
sustainable and environmental friendly manner, are based on the
very real prospect of the tsetse being eradicated by the end of
the IAEA Model Project in 1997. 
<P>
SIT will be deployed throughout Unguja. But the early focus has
been on the southern forest pockets - Jozani, Central Muyuni and
Coastal Muyuni - which are inaccessible to other techniques.
Therefore, since September 1994 sterile male releases have been
exclusively by air. Experience, in Zimbabwe and elsewhere, shows
insecticide spraying by air is often ineffective and hazardous.
But the 30 milligram flies are not blown off-target by light
winds and thermal currents, so the aircraft can fly at a safe
height above the forest canopy, and effective air drops can be
made throughout the day instead of only at night when the ground
gets cool.
<P>
National authorities have provided scientists, technicians,
infrastructure, as well as cash to the project; they also
integrated it with national development plans so that its
benefits reach those who will use the tsetse-free land. The
Zanzibar programme is developing an integrated smallholder farm
system, with help from the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD), to ensure that farm families are the
principal beneficiaries and that freed land is used sustainably.

Across the high Andean plateau in Peru and Bolivia, the diets of
the impoverished peasant communities remain inadequate. Staple
foodgrains cannot be grown because of the oxygen-short
conditions, the stress of daily temperature variations and high
ultra violet exposure under cloudless skys. An early barley,
perhaps introduced from Europe many centuries ago, does manage to
survive. But it is poorly acclimatized and its yields are
extremely low.
<P>
The plateau is mostly a flat plain, 3400-4000 metres above sea
level. Local farmers cultivate protein-rich Amaranthus,
Quinaoa,varieties of potatoes and faba bean which can fix
atmospheric nitrogen and naturally fertilize the soil, much the
same as the ancient Incas did. Soon they may well have a superior
barley. 
<P>
The IAEA has helped Peru develop its capability to apply nuclear
techniques and these are now being used to breed new
high-yielding grain varieties with built-in stress resistance.
They could not only increase the food security of the high Andes,
but promote sustainable grain production on a large scale as
well. A mutant variety of barley, <I>UNA-La Molina 95</I>, began
field testing last May and is now being multiplied at several
sites in the Peruvian highlands. 
<P>
Plant breeding is exacting. It requires persistence and care and,
most of all, time. Irradiation of seeds with gamma rays can help
to accelerate the process and leads to changes in the genetic
traits of the plants which are inherited. The story of the new
barley mutant goes back more than 15 years to when plant breeder
Marino Romero Loli became head of the cereals department of the
national agriculture university in La Molina. A son of the high
plateau himself, Romero Loli set course to produce, by mutation,
new varieties of barley and wheat that would be viable in the
highlands. 
<P>
His initial aim was to improve the diet, health and economy of
the highland communities. But with some three million hectares of
the plateau (in Peru and Bolivia) considered arable, the longer
term prospect of intensive commercial cultivation was inviting
too. The task may have seemed whimsical because the first
essential ingredient to produce a mutant, local parent material,
was missing - no wheat or oats at all and the unacclimatized
barley was clearly unsuitable. But there was early support from
outside and the FAO/IAEA Joint Division became involved shortly
thereafter. 
<P>
The breeding strategy began with field testing a wide collection
of wheat, barley and oat germplasm. Over the years some 10,000
varieties provided by international and national centres all over
the world were grown in tiny beds to see which did best in the
inhospitable climate. From those that showed most promise Romero
Loli's team produced a new barley variety using conventional
breeding methods. It went through the required field growing and
selecting for eight generations, and was released in 1990 under
the name <I>Buena Vista</I>.
<P>
The scene was set for mutation breeding using radiation. Peru's
nuclear infrastructure, equipment and mutation breeding skills
had already been systematically improved through IAEA technical
assistance for more than a decade. A US donation of $1.5 million
for the region enabled the Agency to help Peru beyond mere
equipment and training. Plant breeding at La Molina was
co-ordinated with work in other FAO/IAEA activities including a
regional programme for Improvement of Cereals through Mutation
Breeding in Latin America, and a related Coordinated Research
Programme. 
<P>
The La Molina team irradiated <I>Buena Vista</I>  seeds and
obtained the mutant variety UNA-La Molina 95. The mutant has
three main advantages over the parent. It matures some three
weeks earlier - which will enable it to reach the seed ripening
stage when the dry season arrives. It is shorter - a protection
against being flattened by wind or hail. It produces a naked
(huskless) grain with higher protein content which is easier to
both cook and feed to animals.
<P>
The three new traits make the mutant very promising. But the
proof of viability is in the growing. When the ongoing
multiplication phase produces two to three tons of barley seeds
(expected this year) they will be delivered to demonstration
plots of selected farmers who have a good reputation in villages.
They will grow it together with the previous (parent) variety.
Only then can the quality of the mutant be gauged. It will take
longer, 2-3 years, to demonstrate true success - after farmers
have grown it on many thousands of hectares. But chances look
good that the 21st Century may begin with the first cultivable
Andean grain and new opportunities for agricultural development.
<P>
Meanwhile the private sector has also recognized the promise of
mutation breeding. A Peruvian brewery company <I>Malteria Lima
SA</I> is providing funds and managerial help to the agricultural
university at La Molina to multiply the seeds of the mutant
variety of barley it has developed and to distribute them to the
selected farmers in the high plateau even though it has different
characteristics from the barley used for beer. UNA-La Molina 95
is huskless and has a high protein content. Brewers seek barley
with protein content as low as possible, and therefore always
with husks. Malteria's reasoning is that the other traits - early
maturation and short stature - promise intensive high-input
cultivation at high altitude. If the '95' variety is successful
3000-plus metres above sea level and in other hostile conditions,
then yet another variety (husked and low protein) could well be
found in the same way.

Increasingly throughout rural areas of central and western Java,
small groups of people, mainly women, may be seen mixing what
appears to be large loads of unlovely and smelly muck. In fact,
they are doing something both economically and scientifically
sound, making Urea-Molasses-Multinutrient Blocks (UMMBs) to feed
to their ruminant animals - buffalo, cattle, goats and sheep -
and provide them with some essential nutrients they lack.
<P>
Shortages of quality feed for livestock is common throughout much
of Asia, where there is little land set aside as pasture and few
forage crops are grown. Most cattle are kept by small farmers in
herds of 2 or 3, rarely more than a dozen, in mixed-enterprises
that include crop cultivation. They forage on what they can find,
such grass and straw by roads and fields, and residues of
agriculture and food production. Yields and quality of milk and
meat are low. 
<P>
Improving the quality of feed for ruminants in a way that small
farmers can afford in terms of cash and labour was the task taken
up in the early 1980s by scientists led by <A
HREF="box2.htm">Ms.Cornelia Hendratno</A>
at the Centre for Application of Isotopes and Radiation, which is
part of Indonesia's Atomic Energy Agency (BATAN). They had funds
from the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the infrastructure
and skills developed over many years with help from the IAEA. The
technique involves the use of benign tracer isotopes that reveal
the fate of feed constituents in the digestive system of
ruminants.
<P>
The multinutrient block, a mixture of feeds and vitamins, that
Ms. Hendratno and her team developed after years of lab research
and animal tests has been received enthusiastically by Java's
villages. It has stimulated 30% increases in milk yield and over
100% increases in growth rates of beef cattle, goats and sheep.
Perhaps the key to its appeal is that it uses locally available
feedstuffs - straw, rice stubble and bran, cottonseed cake, waste
from fish processing and even poultry litter - mixed with
appropriate amounts of urea, molasses and various minerals.
<P>
The mixture is pressed into moulds and dried to make brick-like
blocks. A key feature of a block is that it must have a
consistency that enables an animal to lick it but prevents it
from eating it all at once. This has been successfully worked out
for various formulations so that once the mixture is prepared by
the villagers it is not necessary to thumb-test each brick.
<P>
The urea provides nitrogen proteins for growth; the molasses
gives the energy and sulphur helps utilize the nitrogen and build
up microbial protein that provides amino acids. Other minerals,
like calcium and phosphorus essential for lactating animals, can
also be added. Each block is made large enough to avoid the
labour of too frequent replenishment and enabling adequate stocks
to be made. The aim is that each animal licks 500-700 grams of it
per day on average.
<P>
During earlier field trials to assess the efficacy of various
formulations in local animals, Ms. Hendratno and her team found
that community women in particular wanted to be trained to mix
and make the blocks. Farming families soon joined in cooperatives
to produce and use them. In the past few years the Ministry of
Agriculture has taken on the task of extension work, promoting
the technique, teaching villagers to make bricks with locally
available materials, and encouraging local co-operative schemes.
<P>
Under a Agency technical co-operation project launched in 1994, 
BATAN started training courses last year in three islands (East
Java, South Sulawesi and West Sumatra,) and field-testing of
blocks with feed materials available in each region. 
<P>
Meanwhile in West and Central Java, the Ministry has now taken
the technology to villages across all districts. In addition to
such extension activities, several hands-on training courses have
been conducted for leaders of farmers groups. One in West Java in
1995 brought together 236 farmers for three months. This course
evaluated 395 dairy cows, 80 beef cattle, and 100 sheep. A
similar one was completed in Central Java late last year and
involves analysis of 180 animals. Cumulative results of field
trials indicates that UMMB supplementation could increase monthly
net income by 200% for dairy and beef cattle farmers and 100% for
sheep farmers.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Smallholder agriculture is the backbone of Mali's economy. But
yields of staples - millet, sorghum, rice, maize and fonio - have
not kept up with population growth, and the rising cost of cereal
imports now consumes 6.5% of GDP. Crop improvement has depended
almost solely on seed selection by individual farmers, while
systematic plant breeding has only recently arrived. Breeding
more productive rice and sorghum is the principal  challenge.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Malian scientists have now produced rice and sorghum mutants that
could benefit smallholders and the national economy if widely
grown. But until recently strains remained in the laboratory.
Now, with new initiatives in Agency technical co-operation, the
new mutant varieties will be taken to the farmers through a
government extension programme that involves community
participation.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
In the expansive floodplains of the Niger River in Mali farmers
have grown rice for many centuries. This peculiar "African rice",
or <I>Oryza glaberrima</I>, evolved here before the arrival of
humans. Its make-up includes genetic traits essential for
survival. Its stalk grows in pace with the rising water, keeping
its panicle (seed head) afloat; it can cope with dehydration
stress after the waters recede; and it shatters seed when mature.
<P>
Mali's native sorghum relies exclusively on rainfall and has
traits that give it resistance to drought. Farmers grow varieties
that are extremely tall, sometimes 3 1/2 metres because the stalk
has many economically important uses - as cattle feed and roof
thatch, for making mats and even the small huts in which grain is
stored.
<P>
The challenge for plant breeders is to improve productivity of
these crops, while conserving their essential traits. Malian
scientists Fousseyni Cisse and Al Housseni Bretaudeau led
research teams to find mutant varieties of rice and sorghum at
the <I>Institut d'Economie Rural and Institut Polytechnique
Rural</I>, respectively. Under a recently completed FAO/IAEA
Coordinated Research Programme (CRP) funded by Italy and designed
to help improve local and basic food crops of Africa they
irradiated traditional varieties with gamma rays according to the
prescribed procedures. IAEA technical co-operation had already
provided training and equipment to enable the two national
scientific institutions to have the capacity to apply nuclear
techniques such as mutation breeding, to improve yields and other
enhanced characteristics of traditional food crops. 
<P>
During the five years of the CRP, Cisse's rice team was not able
to identify a non-shattering variety, which was its aim, but it
did develop some new types with white color characteristics and
high yields. White rice in Africa fetches double the price of
red; so for farmers the colour alone means an income hike, with
high yield a bonus. Bretaudeau's team obtained sorghum mutants
that grow tall but do not lodge, and some with increased seed;
one with 50 cm panicles, twice as long as usual (see photo).
<P>
These preliminary successes prompted the Agency to launch a
Technical Co-operation Model Project to continue the mutation
breeding activities, to carry the achievements of the scientists
out into field trials that could eventually benefit farmers and
to expand related research and development capability in plant
tissue culture by setting up a dedicated laboratory along with
top level training in these techniques. 
<P>
Within the multi-purpose Model Project, field performance trials
on mutants of both rice and sorghum crops have already started.
So have some soil trials, using stable nitrogen (N<SUP>15</SUP>)
isotope techniques developed by the FAO/ IAEA Joint Division,
mainly to determine optimal use of fertilizer because every new
genotype has its own nutritional requirements. Further soil/plant
density trials will establish other parameters such as how many
plants should be grown in different areas.
<P>
This effort reflects an impressive array of high technology and
sophisticated training, but can it really help the poor local
farmer who probably can't read? The experts think so, and the
Model Project approach is intended to focus technology and its
benefits on the end-user. Initial field tests show increases of
10% in sorghum production and 15% in rice, and the demonstration
phase is being expanded significantly this year and next. New
plant breeding techniques that merge conventional  breeding with
new bio-technical approaches and mutation techniques are
improving the odds that the new varieties can successfully
compete with native breeds. A comprehensive "package"of agronomic
practices will help guide farmers to higher yields using
fertilizer management techniques resulting from soil trials using
stable nitrogen (N<SUP>15</SUP>) isotope techniques. One such practice
would incorporate nitrogen fixing legumes (see related story on
Biofertilizer in Zimbabwe) in the cropping system for a low-cost,
or no-cost alternative nitrogen fertilizer.
<P>
The extension services of the Ministry of Agriculture will take
these "best" practices to the farmers to train and demonstrate
their benefits. With the World Bank now supporting a national
facility to reproduce seeds on a commercial scale, Mali's farmers
could soon begin to realize the dream of two research scientists
who were inspired to push back the limitations of native
cultivars and make an important contribution to the food security
of their countrymen.

<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>

SIT involves rearing, sterilizing, and releasing male flies of
the target species so that they vastly outnumber wild males in
the area. The wild females they mate with will not be able to lay
fertile eggs. Over time the reproduction of the wild population
dwindles and eventually dies out. One common problem is
re-infestation from outside the target area.
<P>
<I>A unique challenge</I> with tsetse flies is that they must be
fed with blood. It is not possible to maintain large enough
breeding colonies fed on living animals, and the flies normally
do not feed on blood any way but through skin. Scientists at the
IAEA lab in Seibersdorf solved the twin problem in the early
1980s with a technique that can maintain insects on a factory
scale by giving them bloodmeals through an artificial membrane,
thus fooling the flies into thinking they are feeding on live
animals.
<P>
<I>On the horizon</I> is an automated computer controlled system
that eliminates the labour intensive steps of chilling newly
hatched flies, manually separating males and females, and then
thawing them again. This procedure currently takes over 40% of
the time necessary to produce sterile males. Chilling weakens
both sexes. Overchilling can kill or render females sterile.
Physical handling can damage individuals. The new system will sex
the flies in flight, as they emerge from hatching or mating
areas, and guide them into separate cages. It could be ready for
use within three years. It would improve fly quality and cut time
and effort from the four skilled people now needed to breed
100,000 flies, to half a person to breed a million.
<P>
<I>Further</I> ahead is the prospect of genetic manipulation of
tsetse so that colony females would produce only males, or the
two genders would react differently to temperature in the pupal
stage and one or other could be killed by simple warming or
cooling. Fewer females could produce more males.

Despite major advances and "revolutions" in agricultural
production, many countries still face enormous obstacles in
meeting their current demand for food. In Africa for example,
projected demand will require a tripling of the current
agricultural output in the next 30 years. A country's capacity to
produce surplus food remains a basic distinction between
developed and developing countries. As the scramble for control
of global resources intensifies, the gap grows wider.
<P>
How will the developing world's farmers meet these staggering
requirements for more food? What improvements in agricultural
systems will permit doubling let alone a tripling of output?
<P>
These increases will only occur if agricultural resources are
expanded or more productive resources become available in
agricultural systems. Such "resources" include land, water, the
human knowledge base, technology and institutional support. The
food and agricultural programme of the IAEA is operated jointly
with FAO to assist Member States in using nuclear techniques to
improve both the <I>quality</I> and <I>quantity</I> of
agricultural resources. The availability of agricultural land and
water are being expanded through environmentally sustainable
approaches that include SIT technology to biologically eradicate
pests like the Tsetse fly that severely limits animal production
across vast areas of Africa; and isotopic techniques to study
irrigation and ground water dynamics. The quality of agricultural
resources is being enhanced through the introduction of more
productive technologies: mutation breeding is a technique to
create new plant characteristics such as drought resistance or
higher yield. Improved farming practices such as the use of
rhizobia to inoculate crops and improve soil fertility is an
environmentally safe and economical alternative to conventional
fertilizers. Soil moisture and nutrient management are fostered
by agro-chemical techniques that improve crop yield and food
quality. In the areas of animal production and health, nuclear
techniques have unlocked many secrets of the biological processes
responsible for growth, health and reproduction of farm animals.
The growing importance of food preservation techniques such as
irradiation is reinforced by the loss of one quarter of world's
food production after harvest. 
<P>
The IAEA's Technical Co-operation activities in agriculture play
a small but increasingly catalytic role in sustainable
agricultural development. This edition of <I>Inside TC</I> 
illustrates how a new partnership is being forged between
scientists and development managers to empower farmers through a
variety of specialized techniques, improved practices and
agricultural knowledge systems.

<B>AGFAX:  Reaching Zimbabwe Farmers</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I> The interview on SIT and Tsetse was a very useful eye-opener,
especially considering that in Zimbabwe, the tsetse flies are
very troublesome. This interview was translated into a vernacular
programme broadcast on Radio 2."   Statement by Zimbabwe
Broadcasting Corporation </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The use of technology for development depends on attitudes and
these are influenced by information and education. The Department
of Technical Co-operation (TC) is increasing public awareness of
its Model Projects activities through a series of contributions
to the AGFAX media service. Articles for the press and interviews
with IAEA staff on key agricultural issues are recorded and
distributed on a monthly basis to leading radio stations and
newspapers in anglophone Africa and to major European and North
American organizations broadcasting worldwide. The Sterile Insect
Technique (SIT) to eradicate tsetse flies, the improvement of
african rice by mutation breeding and nuclear techniques analysis
of nitrogen in crops are among the range of topics covered.
<P>
You or your colleagues could help us reach broader audiences.
Upon request recorded copies and full transcripts of these
interviews are available for use by national broadcasters free of
charge. Each audio cassette comprising a five minute feature is
edited and ready to broadcast. For more information, contact the
IAEA TC Programme Co-ordination Section.
<P>
AGFAX is produced by World Radio for Environment (WREN), a media
organization based in the UK.
<P>
<B>Mutated Rice Gains Ground in Asia</B>
<P>
Nine varieties of early season rice, obtained by induced mutation
of locally grown varieties, were officially released and
cultivated on 598,100 hectares in five provinces along the
Yangtze River in China last year. The mutant varieties now cover
about 11% of the total  5.5 million hectares of rice growing area
in these provinces. The performance of each mutant variety varied
depending on the agroclimatic conditions in particular provinces.
According to data collected during the multilocation trial, yield
increases per hectare for the nine mutant varieties was on
average 440 kg higher than for the control varieties.
<P>
The Chinese National Rice Research Institute estimates a total
yield increase of 263,000 tonnes in the cultivated area. At a
market price of US $200 per tonne the gain to farmers could reach
over US$ 50 million. The extension process was actively supported
by seed companies at the provincial, municipal and county level.
Because the seed multiplication programme has been so
successfully implemented, an extension area of 990,000 hectares
is planned for 1996. 
<P>
In Myanmar, according to recent information received from the
Ministry of Agriculture, the rice mutant <I>Shwewartun</I> showed
improved yield, grain quality and earliness compared to its
parent variety. Over the period 1990 to 1993 the mutant variety
was grown in over 2 million acres or 17% of the total rice area
sown.
<P>
Close collaboration - with national institutes in both China and
Myanmar made possible through co-ordinated research programmes
and technical assistance projects - contributed to the
development of these successful mutant varieties. The experience
gained from these projects is contributing to similar mutation
breeding in other regions (see related story "Floating Rice and
Soaring Sorghum").
<P>
<B>RCA Recognized for Excellence</B>
<P>
Late last year the Joint Inspection Unit, an independent
investigatory body of the UN, compared field level impacts and
results of 10 U.N. sponsored intercountry projects in the Asia
and Pacific Region. One of those selected was the RCA project to
increase the use of nuclear technology in regional industries and
encourage regional industrial competitiveness (see <A
HREF="www.iaea.or.at:80/worldatom/inforesource/bulletin/bull374/t
c2rca8.htm">"Pioneers of
regional cooperation"</A> - <I>Inside TC</I>, December 1995).
This
IAEA-supported project was rated number one in the evaluation
with a score of 96 out of 100 points, one of the best reviews
ever made for a project in the field of science and technology.
The strong commitment of national counterparts and the readiness
of participating governments to collaborate actively with the
private sector were identified as particular strengths of the
project, and the RCA network of cooperating member states was
viewed as a model for Technical Cooperation among Developing
Countries (TCDC). This project was cofinanced with the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and contributions from
Australia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, Korea, Malaysia,
New Zealand and Thailand. RCA Members are now preparing a third
generation project for submission to the Agency and UNDP that
will employ isotope and radiation technologies for better
management of the environment, natural resources and further
promotion of industrial growth.

Many developing countries have the capability to use selected
strains of legume root-nodule bacteria to produce nitrogen, the
most important plant nutrient. But in most, the benefits have
been reaped by larger farms growing cash crops such as soybean.
Subsistence growers, who might gain most from the technology,
have largely missed out. But now up to half a million
smallholders in Zimbabwe will gain access to the technology
through an Agency technical co-operation Model Project set to
begin in 1997.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Bacteria of the rhizobium "family" have been called Nature's
gift to sustainable agriculture. They form nodules in the roots
of legumes and convert nitrogen from the air into the form usable
by plants in a process called "nitrogen fixation". It is a
similar process to the chemical one used by industry to
manufacture urea fertilizer, but root-nodules do it for free.
Though nodulation occurs only in symbiotic relationship with
legume plants, the nitrogen they 'fix' is sufficient to nourish a
subsequent non-leguminous crop. In recent years the technology to
mass produce specific 'inoculants' of rhizobia strains has
matured. Indeed the biological route now provides more than a
third of all nitrogen used in world agriculture, but nearly all
of that is consumed either in developed countries or large
commercial farms in the developing world.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Nearly 25 to 30 Agency agricultural projects around the world now
have a rhizobial component. The first Model Project dedicated to
it was launched last year in Bangladesh (see <A
HREF="tc/tcflyer/itc3frt.htm"><I>Inside TC</I></A>,
September 1995). It is developing commercial scale production of
inoculant. Assisted by IAEA projects since 1988, and using the
<A HREF="box8.htm">stable isotope N<SUP>15</SUP> technique</A>
largely developed by the Joint FAO/ IAEA Division, the Bangladesh
Institute of Nuclear Agriculture (BINA) has identified rhizobial
strains and matching varieties of legumes that together would
best fix nitrogen in local soils.
<P>
The new project, proposed for 1997/98, in Zimbabwe will use the
N<SUP>15</SUP> technique to screen and select efficient rhizobia
to
maximize yields of important legume varieties grown locally, and
possibly also obtain new varieties using radiation mutation
breeding techniques. Zimbabwe already has a large factory to
multiply rhizobia and put them in medium for distribution to
commercial farmers, and its production could be expanded to meet
the needs of small-scale farmers for inoculants.
<P>
Zimbabwe's Country Programme Framework (CPF), drawn up by the
IAEA and the Government, is focussed on a limited number of
technical co-operation priority activities where the technologies
have demonstrable value and the government is committed to
developing essential infrastructure. Development of biological
nitrogen fixation for subsistence farmers in the communal areas
is one such activity. Levels of crop production in the
small-scale farming sector of Zimbabwe are very low, mainly due
to low soil fertility - particularly nitrogen and phosphorus. The
CPF confirmed that the technical capability and counterpart
structure to undertake this activity is strong and that previous
technical co-operation work has developed data on nitrogen
fixation using three locally grown legumes. A multidisciplinary
research team has already been trained and prepared to undertake
the task.
<P>
Given these promising conditions and drawing upon the ongoing
experience in Bangladesh, the TC Department is confident that the
project being formulated will make a significant contribution to
food production and small farm prosperity in rural Zimbabwe.

Fig. 2: The hydrological cycle - a schematic representation of
the movement of water both above and below the earth's surface. 
The figure indicates approximate oxygen-18 values [expressed in
the delta notation in parts per thousand
(<SUP>0</SUP>/<SUB>00</SUB>) deviation from the standard mean
ocean water].  The oxygen-18 values change through environmental
processes and can be used to trace the pathway and history of
water.

Fig. 4: In low-rainfall, arid conditions, infiltrating rainwater
moves intermittently, and may remain in the unsaturated zone for
decades.  The "peak" in tritium concentrations of precipitation
worldwide may still be found in soil profiles, such as this one
from Senegal, which show how far down moisture has moved from the
surface since it was deposited by rain in the early 1960's.

Fig. 9:  Groundwater "ages" in the Syrian desert range up to
40,000 years.  More negative values of <SUP>2</SUP>H indicate
moister past climates with a very wet period about 10,000 to
20,000 years ago.  More positive values, also found in the Sahara
desert, indicate peristent aridity in the region.  Isotope
methods determined that the age of major groundwater reserves
beneath the Sahara is greater than 10,000 years.

Fig. 13: Monthly composite samples of rain and snow are collected
at stations around the world and analysed for <SUP>18</SUP>O,
<SUP>2</SUP>H and <SUP>3</SUP>H.  The Agency's laboratory in
Vienna performs part of the analyses of the large numbers of
samples while the remainder are analyzed in Member States. 
(Figure insert shows the relationship of <SUP>18</SUP>O and
<SUP>2</SUP>H in precipitation worldwide, on which interpretation
of hydrological processes are based).

A tandem particle accelerator in Switzerland.  Accelerator Mass
Spectrometry (AMS), a new and extremely sensitive technique for
the
measurement of radioactive and stable isotopes, has been
developed
at various centres around the world.  It has revolutionized
dating
techniques and quickly found applications in hydrology.

<H2>Safeguards in the Newly Independent States of the Former USSR </H2>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
By the end of 1994, twelve of the newly independent States had acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Three of these (Armenia, Lithuania and Latvia) had concluded safeguards agreements with the Agency and inspections to verify the initial  inventories were carried out. in other States with substantial nuclear programmes:
<UL>
<LI>preparations were made for the implementation of safeguards, with 18 technical visits made to States, including visits to major facilities, parlicularly in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine;
<LI>preliminary information was obtained regarding nuclear installations, nuclear materials and nuclear material accountancy and control systems;
<LI>safeguards requirements and the need for support by donor States, co-ordinated by the Agency, were identified.
</UL>
<P>
An important part of the Agency's support in 1994 was in the form of training on nuclear material accountancy organized for personnel from national control bodies as well as facilities.In all, there were training events for 218 participants.
<P>
Once initial inspection activities have been completed, the total safeguards effort in the newly independent States is expected to amount to about 6% of the Agency's current total inspection effort.

<H2>Convention on Nuclear Safety and the New Basic Safety Standards</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>       
There were two important developments in the areas of radiation and nuclear safety.
<P>
<UL>         
<LI>On 17 June 1994, at a Diplomatic Conference in Vienna, representatives from 84 countries adopted the text of the Convention on Nuclear Safety. The Convention applies to "nuclear installations", defined as land based civil nuclear power plants. It stipulates that the Agency shall provide the Secretariat for the meetings of the Contracting Parties. The Convention was opened for signature on 20 September 1994 in conjunction with the thirty-eighth regular session of the General Conference. It will enter into force after the deposit with the Director General of "the twenty-second instrument of ratification, including the instruments of seventeen States, each having at least one nuclear installation which has achieved criticality in a reactor core" (Article 31). As of 1 February 1995, 54 States had signed the convention and 1 State (Norway) had ratified it. The Convention provides that not later than six months after its entry into force, a "preparatory meeting" of Contracting Parties is to be held. At that meeting the Contracting Parties shall adopt Rules of Procedure and Financial Rules and shall establish, inter alia, guidelines regarding the form and structure of the reports to be submitted to the "review meetings" of the Contracting Parties, as well as the process for reviewing such reports.
<P>
<LI>In September, the Board of Governors gave approval for the publication of the International Basic Safety Standards for Protection Against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources. This new edition, jointly sponsored by the FAO, IAEA, ILO, OECD/NEA, PAHO and WHO, is based on the latest assessments of the biological effects of radiation made by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation and on recommendations from the International Commission on Radiological Protection and the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group. The Standards reflect the achievement of international consensus on requirements for radiation protection and safety for the following:
<UL>
<P>         
<LI>Planned practices such as nuclear power generation and the use of radiation and radioactive materials in medicine and industry;
<LI>Intervention in existing situations such as chronic exposure to natural sources of radiation or exposure following an accident;
<LI>Control of radiation sources, including notification and authorization and criteria for exemption.
<P>
</UL>         
Consensus guidance is also given on:
<UL>
<P>        
<LI>Occupational radiation protection;
<LI>Protection of patients in radiography, fluoroscopy, computer tomography, mammography and nuclear medicine;<BR>
<LI>Protection of members of the public from exposure to radioactive materials released to the environment;
<LI>Prevention of incidents giving rise to potential exposures;
<LI>Intervention in a radiological emergency.

Significant achievements were made in the Agency's programme on the use of the sterile insect technique (SIT) for the eradication of insect pests:
<P>

<LI>Major progress was made in the eradication of the Mediterranean fruit fly in the Province of Mendoza in Argentina. In collaboration with the provincial and federal governments all activities in the SIT programme were scaled up and by the end of 1994 two hundred million sterile flies were being released each week over the half a million hectares of orchards and urban areas of the province. Commercial fruit crops are already free of the pest and eradication in urban areas will be attempted in the 1995-1996 season.
 <P>        
<LI>The SIT programme on Zanzibar, United Republic of Tanzania, to eradicate the tsetse fly made rapid progress. Sterile tsetse flies were released for the first time by air and the whole southern part of the island, including the Jozani and Muyuni forests where the highest tsetse populations are located, is now under aerial releases. The first phase of the refurbishment of the Tanga facility was completed, thereby increasing significantly the sterile fly production capacity. Monitoring indicates that already one fourth to one third of all wild tsetse females captured in the southern part of the island show signs of induced sterility. With increasing fly production, the aerial release of sterile flies will be extended progressively to the northern half of the island.
 <P>        
<LI> Important advances were made in the improvement and field evaluation of Mediterranean fruit fly genetic sexing strains developed by the Agency's Laboratory at Seibersdorf. As part of the assessment, weekly shipments of sterile males of two genetic sexing strains were made in support of a technical co-operation project in Tozeur, Tunisia. On the basis of these field results, as well as previous evaluations in Greece and ongoing tests in Guatemala, there is now confidence that these advanced sexing strains possess the necessary robustness to play an important role in large scale SIT programmes. As an example of this confidence, the United States Department of Agriculture in Hawaii recently requested one of these sexing strains for production at one of its mass rearing facilities.
<P>         
<LI> The Mediterranean fruit fly mass rearing facility in Arica, Chile, initiated operations. Joint Chile-Peru preventive releases of sterile flies are now replacing insecticide sprays along the border of these two countries to deal with wild flies moving south to fly free areas. A programme was initiated in Madeira, Portugal, with the objective of using the SIT against the Mediterranean fruit fly, the only fruit fly pest on the island. A sterile fly mass rearing facility has been designed and construction will be initiated in 1995.

<P>    
In 1994 the Agency expanded the introduction of the systematic application of the Programme Performance Assessment System (PPAS). Under the PPAS, it is the responsibility of Agency managers to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Assess the merits of proposed projects in terms of their potential benefits to Member States;
<LI>Develop clear project objectives, set completion dates and establish performance indicators for reviews at predetermined intervals;
<LI>Examine completed projects and evaluate their actual success and benefits to Member States.
</UL>
<P>         
During the year, approximately thirty Agency projects were selected for performance review on the basis of their importance to the overall programme of work. Each of the selected projects received a performance review at mid-year to:
<P>  
<UL>       
<LI>Verify its continued relevance;
<LI>Determine the status of the tasks planned;
<LI>Compare the estimated expenditures against budgeted amounts;
<LI>Clarify deviations from the work plan and/or budget;
<LI>Identify potential problems or planned improvements.
</UL>
<P>         
In order to assist programme and project managers, training seminars and briefings on the principles and procedures of PPAS were held. Over one hundred staff members received this training.

BACKGROUND
</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<P>
The consequences attributed to the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have been subjected to extensive scientific examination; however, they are still viewed with widely differing perspectives. Ten years after the accident, the European Commission (EC), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) are jointly sponsoring an International Conference to recapitulate the accident's consequences and to seek a common and conclusive understanding of their nature and magnitude. The Conference, One Decade after Chernobyl: Summing Up the Consequences of the Accident, is being organized in co-operation with the United Nations through its Department of Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA), as well as with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR),  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development through its Nuclear Energy Agency (OECD/NEA), and will take place in the Austria Center Vienna, Austria, from 8 to 12 April 1996.
<P>
The Conference will take particular account of the findings of two prior Conferences. These are: the WHO International Conference on the Health Consequences of the Chernobyl and other Radiological Accidents, to be held in Geneva from 20 to 23 November 1995, and the First International Conference of the European Union, Belarus, the Russian Federation and the Ukraine on the Consequences of the Chernobyl Accident,  to be held in Minsk  from 18 to 22 March 1996.  In addition to including summaries from and being complementary to these prior Conferences, the Conference in Vienna will also address the accident's associated environmental consequences and social, economic and political impacts. It will also consider the outcome of a preceding IAEA/UNDHA International Meeting on the Safety of Chernobyl , which will be held in Vienna from 1-3 April 1996, and will address, among other things, the remedial measures taken since the accident to improve the safety of Chernobyl type reactors and of the containment structure (the so-called sarcophagus) built around the destroyed reactor.

<HR>
<OL>
<LI>Last year the General Conference, in resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/9, stated- inter alia - that "the quality and quantity of available water resources, particularly in arid and semi-arid zones, are inadequate and that the availability of clean water is a minimal requisite for sustaining development, " that "the availability of clean drinking water is directly linked to human health and has consequent serious economic implications" and that isotope hydrology techniques "are valuable in studying processes like groundwater recharge, surface and sub-surface water interaction, water salination, seepage and the pollution of water bodies and that their use should be integrated with conventional techniques".
<P>
<LI>Also, the Conference requested the Director General "to direct the available expertise and resources to a few concrete and cogent projects which would result in a visible impact in improved water resources management through isotope techniques", urged the Agency "to work in conjunction with other concerned international organizations and solicit their co-operation in such projects" and urged the Secretariat "to endeavour to secure resources needed for this purpose."
<P>
<LI>Lastly, it requested "that the Director General report on the progress achieved in the implementation of this resolution to the Board of Governors and to the General Conference at its thirty-ninth regular session". The present document has been prepared in response to that request and is being issued for the attention of both the Board of Governors and the General Conference.

Extensive use of isotope hydrology for water resources development and management
</STRONG>
</CENTER> 
<P>
1. Introduction
<P>
Recognizing the vital role of adequate water resources for sustainable development and the potential of isotope techniques in water resources management, the Board of Governors discussed in June 1994 the subject of "Utilizing Isotope Hydrology for Groundwater Management in Arid-and Semi-arid Zones of Africa". In response to recommendations of the Board meeting and the resolution of the subsequent General Conference GC(XXXVIII)/RES/9 on the extensive use of isotope hydrology for water resources management, initiatives were undertaken to strengthen the end-user benefit and socio-economic impact of the utilization of isotope techniques in water resources development and management of Member States. Three of the technical co-operation projects for the 1995/96 programme cycle were designed in accordance with the Model Project concept.  Furthermore, activities were launched to provide technical assistance to riparian countries of the Caspian Sea in tackling environmental problems such as groundwater pollution in coastal zones which are caused by the current sea level rise.  Through the Agency's technical co-operation programme the specific potential of isotope techniques in addressing such problems will be made available for concerted action. In this context, efforts were made to strengthen the technical co-operation with other UN organizations and to attract donors. New initiatives were also undertaken within the framework of the Agency's research programme. In recognition of the needs for technical support of the practical application of proven isotope techniques in the water sector of Member States, and in promoting the refinement and further development of such techniques, a high-priority activity on the assessment of groundwater renewal and related anthropogenic effects in areas of water scarcity is being launched. This activity includes training in sampling and measurement
techniques as well as isotope aided
         studies.
<P>
         2. Endeavours to enhance the impact in improved water
resources management through
         isotope techniques
<P>
2.1. Model Project Regional Africa RAF/8/022 "Use of Isotopes in Water Resources Development"
<P>
Following the June 1994 Board meeting in which special attention was given to the utilization of isotope techniques in the water sector of African countries, a Model Project was designed on the basis of the proposal for a regional African project. In December, the Model Project Regional Africa RAF/8/022 was approved. The project aims to apply isotope techniques in combination with other hydrogeological investigations to practical problems in the development and optimum management of groundwater resources in nine African countries. It is expected that Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, Mali, Morocco, Niger, Senegal, and Sudan will co-operate in the regional project, which is envisaged to be implemented in two phases over a period of four years.  In phase I (1995-96) the following countries are included: Egypt, Ethiopia, Morocco, Senegal. Activities in other countries are expected to commence in 1997-98.
<P>
In each country, areas have been identified by end users where adequate assessment of scarce water resources is crucial for water supply of large population centres or development activities. In the short term, the data obtained from hydrological studies will be used in estimating recharge rates and water budgets in the countries concerned, which would lead to the development of guidelines for water policy and optimum management of the existing resources. Accordingly, the water authorities and other end users can undertake development plans of the regions under study. In Phase I, water assessment and reassessment activities will have a significant socio-economic impact on water supply to over 3 million people in the Moyale region (Ethiopia), over 1.5 million people in the Dakar region (Senegal) and about half a million people in the South Atlasic region (Morocco).  Furthermore, the results obtained are essential to the reclamation of more than 120,000 Feddans west of the Nile Valley (Egypt) and maintaining 15,000 hectares south of the Atlasic region (Morocco). In phase II, efforts will be devoted to setting up two central laboratories in the region capable of offering analytical and consultancy services to end users and which could play a major role in promoting the use in Africa of isotope techniques in water resources development projects.
<P>
The Agency's input will include expert and consultancy services for the planning, co-ordination, implementation and evaluation of project activities; equipment, consumables and supplies for field, laboratory and specific analytical services; training through the organization of regional scientific seminars and workshops, and the exchange of scientists and qualified technicians. A regional expert was appointed to provide continuous assistance during phase I in the implementation of isotope hydrological field work and co-ordination of regional activities to be implemented by the Agency in support of the Model Project.
<P>
The first major activity in the implementation of project activities was the Co-ordination Meeting which was held in Addis Ababa from 3 to 7 April 1995. During the meeting, the programme of activities to be carried out in each of the participating countries in 1995-1996 was finalized, the national contributions to the project in terms of scientific and support staff, analytical laboratory facilities, drilling and sampling equipment were reviewed.  Inputs to be provided by the Agency in support of country-specific field activities to meet the objectives of the Model Project were determined. The meeting harmonized the countries' work plans for 1995-96 and discussed the technical backstopping and organizational and managerial support to be provided by the regional expert to assist the countries in launching the field work. Laboratories which will be requested to perform isotopic measurements of the water samples have been identified as well.
<P>
In connection with the activities planned in each country, particular attention was given to two national training courses; one of them will be held in Morocco on isotope techniques in unsaturated zones and the other one in Senegal on data gathering and modelling of the Cap Verde Peninsula aquifer. Moreover, a regional training course in hydrochemistry for technicians - in conjunction with an inter-comparison exercise to ensure the quality of hydrochemistry measurements - was agreed to be held in Dakar, Senegal.
<P>
Financing for the project is US$1,776,000 which is distributed over the period from 1995 to 1998. It will be realized by the Agency's technical assistance and co-operation funds (TCF).
<P>
2.2. Model Project VEN/8/010 "Groundwater Hydrology of the Caracas Aquifer" (Venezuela)
<P>
This Model Project focusses on the use of isotope techniques in tackling the currently existing serious problems in drinking water supply of the city of Caracas. As in many other drastically expanding megacities in Asia, Latin America and Africa, the rapid population growth of Caracas has led to a sharp increase in drinking water demand and consequently to a deficit in drinking water which has been aggravated by the present climatic trend characterized by an increase in the frequency of drought periods. Authorities restrict water usage, and several city districts have access to water only a few hours a day.
<P>
A practical attempt to reduce the existing deficit is seen in the exploitation of the "Valle de Caracas" aquifer, an urban aquifer system which so far has scarcely been used for drinking water supply. Therefore, its potential is yet unknown. Currently, the groundwater level is progressively rising, mainly due to human activities such as construction of underground structures, river canalization and leakages in the municipal water supply system.
<P>
Consequently, the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Renewable Resources (MARNR), in co-operation with other institutions and local municipalities, is currently investigating the potential of the "Valle de Caracas" aquifer with the final goal of the rational exploitation of the resources for drinking water supply.  The IAEA supported Model Project is part of this endeavour and focusses on the following objectives:
<P>
Quantification of the volume of groundwater available for exploitation;<br>
Identification of recharge sources and mechanisms;<br>
Assessment of water quality changes in the aquifer;<BR>
Definition of flow paths and interconnection between aquifers;<BR>
Evaluation of contamination risks and definition of protection zones.
<P>
The assessment of groundwater dynamics and quality characteristics by means of geochemical and isotopic methods (including tracer experiments) will provide key information for the identification of best areas for drilling additional wells which will diminish the existing water deficit in the metropolitan area. Basic data on the sources and mechanisms of groundwater recharge, the time span for renewal of groundwater and the vulnerability to pollution will also be evaluated for proper management of the water resources in the Caracas Valley. On the basis of this information, local authorities dealing with water resources management will be able to make decisions on the exploitation of the aquifer and in the definition of protection zones to avoid the contamination of areas where groundwater is used for drinking water supply purposes.
<P>
Preliminary results obtained from isotope and geochemical analyses and other hydrogeological studies suggest that groundwater recharge mainly occurs locally through direct infiltration of precipitation. The residence time of water in the aquifer appears to be relatively short (from a few years to decades). A shallow groundwater body was identified which corresponds to the most recently recharged waters and is characterized by a high pollution index. Evidence was found for lateral recharge of surface water from the Avila Mountains which has better quality for drinking purposes. The further implementation of the project is expected to provide consolidation of these and other preliminary findings. The project started in 1994 and will be completed in 1997.  The total budget of the project is US$268,900 which will be funded by the Agency's TCF.
<P>
2.3. Regional Project RAW/8/004 "Preparing Study of Caspian Sea Water Level Fluctuations"and Footnote a/ Regional Project RAW/8/005 "Study of Caspian Sea Water Level Fluctuations"
<P>
The environmental consequences of the recent sea level rise of the Caspian Sea are a matter of great concern to the five riparian countries: Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Iran. The flooding of coastal areas and the economic impact of the estimated 2.5 m rise of sea level in the past 15 years and the continuing rise at the rate of about 15 cm per year has attracted the attention of the international community. The causes of the sea level rise are still being debated and there are at present no indications whether the rise will continue and at what rate.
<P>
Following consultants' advice and in-house assessment, a proposal for a regional technical co-operation project was conceived, taking into account the expertise available in the Isotope Hydrology Section of RIPC, the Seibersdorf Laboratories, and the Marine Environment Laboratory in Monaco. Subsequent to this proposal, two regional projects on the Caspian Sea were approved for the 1996/97 <B>(1)</B>biennial cycle.
<P>
The project "Preparing Study of Caspian Sea Water Level Fluctuations" (RAW/8/004) is of modest scale and meant to initiate and co-ordinate a comprehensive study of the water level fluctuations in the Caspian Sea using nuclear techniques. The budget of US$34,200 for expert services in 1995 and US$66,000 for expert services and provision of training in 1996 will be funded by TCF. The Agency's input to the project includes expert services, guidance and group training for preparation of the study; organization and co-ordination of the work; technical and scientific support for the preparation of field investigations; sampling and measurements at the Agency's laboratories. It is expected that the project will provide an assessment of the present environmental situation of the Caspian Sea region which would help in the elaboration of an environmental strategy and formulation of a specific plan of activities for comprehensive studies of the water level fluctuations in the Caspian Sea.
<P>
The comprehensive study is expected to be undertaken through the footnote a/ project entitled "Study of Caspian Sea Water Level Fluctuations" which requires extrabudgetary resource allocation of US$750,000 for a two-year period.  The Secretariat is seeking donors to fund this project. The problems to be tackled using isotope techniques in combination with other investigations include: water balance and dynamics of sea water; pollution of the surface water; impact of rising sea level on coastal groundwater resources; training and analytical quality control assistance. The project plan envisages several campaigns for collecting samples. These campaigns would be carried out jointly between the IAEA and local institutes, with logistic support of the riparian countries. The reinforcement of the regional network for precipitation sampling as well as the establishment of a network for river water sampling is expected to be arranged by the concerned riparian countries, if possible by institutes of the hydrometeorological service. The long term impact of the project would include a better understanding of the Caspian Sea hydrology and the mechanisms of sustained water balance of the hydro-system in the region. This will be the basis for formulation of recommendations and programme of measures to be undertaken by the countries to cope with the existing environmental problems.
<P>
2.4. Model Project ELS/8/005 "Isotope Hydrology and Geochemistry in Geothermal Fields" (El Salvador)
<P>
The geothermal systems in El Salvador, like most other geothermal systems in the world, are water dominated. The geothermal water which originates from rainfall, circulates through greater depths and is heated by magmatic bodies.  Large volumes of this water with elevated temperatures up to about 300 degrees C are tapped for electrical power generation, among other uses.
<P>
At present, El Salvador is one of the top 10 geothermal energy producers in the world. It will be expanding its utilization of geothermal energy resources for electrical power generation from the current 14% contribution to the national requirement to 22% in the next five years. Likewise, since the geothermal system is water-dominated it generates large amounts of wastewater which could result to thermal and chemical pollution if disposed to the environment.
<P>
The energy development programme of the country requires drilling of about 35 wells in Ahuachapan and Berlin geothermal systems for production of steam and injection of waste water. It also includes the management of surface and groundwater by protecting it from potential pollution by reinjecting to the reservoir wastewater generated from the separation of steam from the geothermal fluids. As a model project with tangible impact on the energy, environment and water sectors, this project has the following objectives:
<P>
(i) Integration of isotope hydrogeochemical techniques in the geoscientific investigations associated with the geothermal electricity development of Ahuachapan and Berlin fields to:
<P>
- determine drilling targets for siting of production and injection wells,<BR>
- develop a reservoir engineering model which will support the management strategies and operational procedures for optimum utilization of the resources.
<P>
(ii) Enhancing local capacity by timely training and technology transfer to improve self-reliance in the use of isotope geochemistry in geothermics and reservoir modelling techniques.
<P>
A hydrogeochemical model will be generated with which drilling strategies will be formulated. Under this project the input of the isotopes such as oxygen-18, deuterium and tritium supplemented by geochemical, geological and reservoir engineering data will provide the information to increase the confidence level for identifying suitable drilling targets; e.g., heat flow regions and areas for reinjection. Likewise, artificial tracing experiments with the use of I-131 and I-125 will be conducted to identify flow patterns and flow rates. The Agency will provide direct assistance to the counterpart institution for practical application of these isotope techniques in identifying suitable areas for production and injection of waste water. The Agency also provides support for monitoring the physical and chemical effects in the reservoir as a result of the reinjection of wastewater and of exploitation. This will prevent pollution of the environment, sustain the geothermal and water resources as well as lengthen the economic life of the reservoir.
<P>
Manpower capability for isotope and geochemical data interpretation, as well as for reservoir modelling will be developed through the fellowship programme. Likewise, the analytical capability for the water and gas chemical analyses will be improved through quality assurance interlaboratory comparison. The project duration is 2 years. The total budget of US$96,000 will be funded by the Agency's TCF.
<P>
2.5. Regional and national projects for the investigation of different aquifer systems and water resources 
<P>
The implementation of a regional technical cooperation project RER/8/002 focussed on isotope field investigations of ten different aquifer systems in the Middle East provided results which help to improve the management of the water resources in this area of water scarcity. The aquifer systems investigated include coastal aquifers in Lebanon and Syria, a karst aquifer in Iran, aquifers with different characteristics in Jordan and in Turkey, over- exploited karst aquifers in the United Arab Emirates, and water movement in the unsaturated zone in Saudi Arabia, Syria and Kuwait. The project facilitated transfer of know-how on isotope applications for groundwater resource assessment and management. Furthermore, a core of well trained staff was created in each of the participating countries viz. the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey and United Arab Emirates. The results of the field investigations will be published in an Agency TECDOC.  Budget allocations for this regional technical co-operation activity was US$61,400 in 1994 as compared to allocation of US$82,800 available for 1995. The source of these funds is TCF. The project will be followed up by the regional project RAW/8/002 included in the 1995/96 TC programme.  <P>
Within the framework of ARCAL XVIII, a regional project was started in five Latin American countries namely Brazil, Costa Rica, Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela. The project aims at the use of nuclear and related techniques for the identification of leakages in dams and reservoirs. Leakages endanger the stability of a dam and represent significant water losses. A workshop was held in S. Luis Potosi, Mexico, which provided training to the counterparts in the application of tracer techniques for the identification of leakages as well as the flow paths of the water from leakages.
<P>
A number of national projects including those in arid regions of Latin America, the Middle East, Asia and Africa are being continued.  Concerning Latin America, in the Peruvian Altiplano (about 4000 m a.s.l), isotope techniques have contributed to identify the origin of groundwater and the altitude of recharge as well as to characterize hydrogeological parameters of the aquifers. These results help to make additional sources of drinking water available which are badly needed in the water-scarce coastal areas of Peru. In a Brazilian project efforts are being made to improve the supply of potable water for the city of Sao Paulo.
<P>
2.6. High priority activity on "Isotope-based Assessment of Groundwater Renewal and related Anthropogenic Effects in Water Scarce Areas"
<P>
In line with the objectives of the above technical co-operation project RAF/8/022 and related initiatives focussing on the use of isotope techniques in arid zone hydrology, an additional initiative was launched as part of the activities of the Department of Research and Isotopes. The focus is on isotope-aided studies of recharge/discharge processes in the unsaturated zone of arid and semi-arid regions, the understanding of which is crucial for any rational water resources management. The tasks of this undertaking are a workshop on "The use of isotope techniques to determine water and contaminant transport in the unsaturated zone, including the provision of necessary training in sampling soil profiles for isotope and geochemical measurements" and a CRP on this subject. The activities will start in 1996 with moderate funding and be carried over to the 1997/98 planning cycle. The financial estimates for 1996 envisage US$35,000 for contracts and sampling equipment and US$15,000 for a workshop. The activities will be funded through the Agency's regular budget.
<P>
It is expected that this initiative will have a bearing on the Agency's technical co- operation programme directed towards a more visible impact on the water sector of Member States. This impact includes prevention of over-exploitation and pollution of the groundwater resources and thus ensure sustainable supply of water to the public and the establishment of efficient irrigation schemes for improved food supply.
<P>
3. Endeavours to strengthen co-operation with other UN organizations and to approach donors
<P>
A number of activities were undertaken to strengthen the co-operation with other UN organizations in the field of water and environment. As far as the technical assistance programme is concerned, the efforts were focussed on concerted actions in the water sector of Africa and on the Caspian Sea environment crisis.
<P>
3.1. Caspian Sea environment crisis
<P>
The IAEA technical co-operation project on the Caspian Sea environmental crisis attempts to involve the collaboration with UN organizations, known to be interested in Caspian Sea matters. To this end, UNEP, WMO, WHO and UNESCO were invited to join the IAEA pre-project mission to the riparian countries.  The Intergovernmental Oceanic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO participated in this mission and since then actively supports the IAEA initiative. Following the pre-project mission, a meeting was called by IAEA in October 1994, to brief the interested UN organizations about the outcome of the mission and the Agency's planned regional technical cooperation project. The deliberations held during the meeting and a follow-up consultation organized by UNEP in January 1995 in Geneva, indicated that a multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach is required to cope with the situation in the Caspian Sea region. The contributions of the concerned UN organizations could address the following:
<P>
- WHO: effects of sea level rise on public health; water quality; health and sanitation; health impact of fish waste recycling;<BR>
- WMO:  hydrometeorological monitoring; sea level rise; water quality;<BR>
- IAEA: sea level rise; water balance; water circulation; sea and coastal water pollution;<BR>
- UNESCO:   organization of workshop/training;<BR>
- UNEP:     co-ordination of interagency collaboration.
<P>
It was agreed that a fact-finding mission of UNEP, UNDP and the World Bank to the riparian countries should be undertaken in the first half of 1995. Following the mission, a proposal for a comprehensive concerted action plan including the above contributions of specialized UN organizations will be prepared and submitted to donors, in particular World Bank and Global Environmental Facility. The IAEA initiatives were recognized as an integral part of the concerted actions and thus, if major donor funding would be secured, the IAEA activities could be financed through this source.
<P>
3.2. Water resources in Africa
<P>
The IAEA is also seeking concrete support for the technical co-operation projects on water resources in Africa in terms of logistics and financial contributions by other organizations and donors. The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), Addis Ababa, and UNEP, Nairobi, were expected to help integrate the IAEA programme in the scope of the Interagency Group for Water in Africa (IGWA), and to promote concerted action with other UN organizations in the water sector of concerned African countries.  A step in this direction was made during the Third Annual Meeting of IGWA which was organized by UNECA and held on 15 and 16 November 1994 at the Headquarters of the UNEP. The meeting was attended by representatives of the following agencies: WHO, UNEP, UNCHS, UNIDO, IAEA, UNECA, UNESCO, WMO and Niger Basin Authority (NBA). The aim of the meeting was to enhance coordination, collaboration and harmonization of water activities among IGWA member agencies which would make the impact of their assistance to African member states more meaningful and visible. During the meeting an overview was given of the IAEA activities in the water sector in Africa with emphasis on the above Model Project. The other UN agencies represented by IGWA were called on to support/join the IAEA activities. The Agency was recognized as one of the UN organizations effectively involved in the water sector in Africa. The meeting explored priority areas for interagency co-ordination to be led by UNEP, jointly with UNECA.  UNEP, through involvement in the Global Environmental Facility and contacts with the World Bank, has the potential to pave the way for funding major field projects in the water sector.  After contacts at a high level between the Director General of the IAEA and the Executive Director of UNEP, close co-operation will be initiated in the framework of the ACC Working Group of Availability and Management of Water in the African context.
<P>
During the First Co-ordination Meeting of the Model Project Regional Africa RAF/8/022 in April 1995 in Addis Ababa, the opportunity was taken to hold discussions with UNECA on the prospects for future co-operation in the water sector of Africa. UNECA envisages joint programming as an important mechanism to develop future co-operative undertakings in collaboration with the Agency in the Africa region. From these discussions, it emerged that the Agency's involvement with respect to isotope hydrology could be envisaged in connection with the programmes that ECA intends to promote on river basins, to enhance trans-boundary resources, and on water resources and the environment of small islands in Africa. A schedule for exchange of information and consultations between IAEA and UNECA has been agreed upon.

<LI>I present herewith the Agency's accounts for the year ended 31 December 1994.  Part I contains the External Auditor's report to the Board of Governors on the audit of the accounts. The Agency's accounts, comprising Statements I to V and Schedules A to G, are presented in Parts II and III respectively. Part IV, entitled "Notes to the financial statements", describes the purpose and financing of the various Funds and the authority under which they are administered, and the significant accounting policies applied by the Secretariat in preparing the statements and schedules. In addition, the notes offer the reader information about significant items and events which could have a bearing on the financial position of the Agency or on the Funds under its control.
<P>
<LI>The presentation of the accounts has been changed in a number of areas where the Secretariat considered that the changes would enhance their information value to Member States. Some changes are also a direct response to the new accounting standards of the United Nations system. More substantial changes may be expected in the future, and after completion of the work of the Consultative Committee on Administrative Questions (CCAQ) Working Group on Financial Statements, which is formulating minimum standards for the presentation of financial statements, schedules and notes which could be recommended for use by all organizations of the United Nations system.
<P>
<LI>Significant changes made this year in the form and contents of the statements, schedules and notes are explained below: 
<P> 
(a) Statements III.B and IV.B show extrabudgetary contributions received, comparing them with the amounts originally expected. In previous years, the amounts shown were those received during the year for which they were pledged; amounts received later were excluded. In order to give equal recognition to Member States for all extrabudgetary contributions, these have been included regardless of when they were pledged.
<P>
(b) In previous years, Statements III.D, IV.D and V.2 showed extrabudgetary and trust fund contribution receivables as assets, and identical offsetting reserves as corresponding liabilities. Since the resources in the extrabudgetary and trust funds are kept on a cash basis, the receivables and the corresponding reserves have been removed from the balance sheets because cash basis accounting does not require the inclusion of accounts receivable in balance sheets.
<P>
(c) In previous years, Statement IV.A presented figures relating to Regional Co-operative Agreement (RCA) activities in a separate line. However, since RCA activities fall under the headings "Technical Co-operation", "Food and Agriculture, "Human Health" and "Nuclear Safety", the figures relating to them are this year reflected under these headings.
<P>
(d) Statements V.l and V.2 showing trust fund activities have been summarized this year. The three existing trust funds - the Research Institutes Trust Fund, the Technical Assistance and Co-operation Fund in Trust and the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor-Engineering Design Activities (ITER EDA) Trust Fund - are now shown in one line each. Full details regarding each research contract and project are available to the trustors.
<P>
(e) Schedule C.2 of the Agency's accounts for 1993 (GC(XXXVIII)/4), a summary of total income and expenditure for the latest complete budget year, has been discontinued. However, the information is available for internal management use.
<P>
(f) A schedule entitled "Administrative Fund - Regular Budget Summary by Item of Expenditure" has been added as Schedule G. The information contained in it is presented in greater detail in the "Report on Programme and Budgetary Performance in 1994" being issued separately under cover of a Note by the Secretariat.
<P>
<LI>The present position of the Agency with regard to the new accounting standards of the United Nations system is explained in Part IV (Note 2(k)).
<P>
<LI>Statement I.A.l shows an amount of $ 13 468 800 in respect of 1994 deferred programme activities which may be implemented in 1995. The extent to which 1993 deferred programme activities were implemented in 1994 is shown in Statement I.A.2; an unused balance of $ 3 446 190 was credited to the 1993 cash surplus. The extent to which 1992 deferred programme activities were implemented in 1994 is shown in Statement I.A.3; an unused balance of $ 1 329 686 was also credited to the 1993 cash surplus.  
<P> 
<LI>The budget year 1993 closed with a final cash surplus of $ 7 490 780, as shown in Statement I.C. Member States' individual shares in this surplus are shown in Schedule C.  As decided by the Board of Governors in June 1994, this cash surplus will be retained until the existence of arrears of contributions ceases to have a major detrimental impact on programme implementation, but in any case not later than 1997, or until otherwise decided by the Board (GOV/2734, Annex 4).
<P>
<LI>Statements IV.C and IV.D each include one new account: Indonesia- to administer a voluntary contribution of money to the Agency in support of Regional Co-operative Agreement (RCA) activities.

<P>
1. On 18 July 1991 the Board of Governors, after considering a report by the Director General on non-compliance by Iraq with its obligations under its safeguards agreement with the Agency (INFCIRC/172), adopted a resolution (contained in document GOV/2532) in which it, inter alia, requested the Director General to keep the Board and the General Conference informed of progress in the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 687 (1991).
<P>         
2. On 23 September 1994, the General Conference adopted, as it had in the three previous years, a resolution in the operative paragraph of which it requested the Director General, inter alia, to report to the Board and to the thirty-ninth regular session of the General Conference on his efforts to implement Security Council resolutions 687, 707 and 715 (1991) (GC(XXXVIII)/RES/19).
<P>    
3. Pursuant to the above-referenced resolutions, the Director General has kept the Board of Governors informed about the IAEA's activities in Iraq and copies of the inspection mission reports containing detailed descriptions of inspectors' work and findings have been transmitted to the Board, to the IAEA's Member States, and to the Security Council.
<P>         
4. The attached chronology by the Director General on "The IAEA's activities concerning Iraq in 1994-95 under United Nations Security Council resolutions 687, 707 and 715 (1991)" has been prepared with a view to updating the information provided last year to the General Conference in documents GOV/2747-GC(XXXVIII)/10. The chronology provides an overview of the major events that occurred during the period September 1994 - August 1995, with references to the relevant documents.

THE IAEA's ACTIVITIES CONCERNING IRAQ IN 1994 - 1995 UNDER UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS 687, 707 AND 715 (1991)
</CENTER>
</STRONG>
<P>
<B>CHRONOLOGY</B>
<P>         
1. The twenty-sixth inspection mission in Iraq under Security Council resolution 687 (1991) took place from 22 August to 7 September 1994. It included an investigation of Iraq's former activities in the field of laser isotope separation and routine inspections at sites associated with the former nuclear weapons programme and marked the start of the continuous presence in Iraq of IAEA's resident inspectors in connection with the implementation of the Ongoing Monitoring and Verification (OMV) Plan.
<P>
In May 1994, the IAEA received information from Member States indicating that Iraq had invested significant resources into uranium enrichment through laser isotope separation (LIS) involving both molecular (MLIS) and atomic vapour (AVLIS) technologies. The subject of LIS had been first raised by IAEA-7 (October 1991), in the course of which the inspection team had received two written statements from a senior Iraqi official denying that Iraq had undertaken any laser enrichment activities and stating that, as a consequence, there were no Iraqi personnel who had been involved in such activities. 
<P>
Although it was difficult to accept that, having explored such a wide range of potential enrichment technologies, Iraq would have completely ignored LIS, there was no evidence available in 1991 to support further investigation.  The information received in May 1994, however, prompted a thorough re-assessment of the situation. A detailed search for laser-related topics in the current Action Team information databases identified a number of activities with respect to laser component manufacture, particularly CO2 lasers and the manufacture of components for use in laser-related experimentation. The investigation carried out by the IAEA-26 inspection team, which included five experts in laser enrichment technology, extended over five inspection days. The most significant event occurred during a seminar, presented by the Iraqi counterpart on the fifth inspection day, when a statement was made on behalf of Iraq to the effect that the Laser Section at Tuwaitha had "received an objective [in 1981] from the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission [IAEC] to work in Laser Isotope Separation.
<P>
.... We started in two lines; one which was looking after the molecular and the other the atomic [vapour] direction". The IAEA team was also advised that when the achievements of the Laser Section were evaluated in 1987 it
was decided that the project should be downgraded to a "watching brief" and that a number of key personnel should be transferred to other projects, notably electromagnetic isotope separation [EMIS]. The seminar provided a more detailed explanation of the information given to the team in the course of the investigation; the major difference being that its connection with LIS was now acknowledged. One IAEC staff member, who had been brought to Tuwaitha specifically to take part in the seminar, described the work he had done on the photoionisation of sodium and rubidium. This individual appeared to be highly motivated and technically competent and described an experimental set-up that had a number of features similar to those of the equipment described in the information which had been provided to the IAEA by Member States. The subsequent transfer of this individual to the EMIS programme was consistent with the declared decision to downgrade the LIS related activities.
<P> 
The IAEA team noted that, as now acknowledged by Iraq and contrary to Iraq's written statements in October 1991 and the FFCl report (June 1992), a specific task to explore the feasibility of LIS as a means of producing enriched uranium had existed. The task appears to have been poorly focused and its limited achievements appear to be consistent with the equipment, personnel resources and expertise available. The team was satisfied that the information regarding the resources, capabilities and activities of the Laser Section which it had gathered during the investigation, was consistent with a loosely co-ordinated and largely empirical approach to LIS, but was not consistent with the achievement of substantial progress in what is a complex technology. There were no indications that the efforts of the Laser Section had reached the point of an integrated experiment that achieved any isotopic separation of either elemental uranium or UF6 or that they had developed even the most rudimentary capabilities in either AVLIS or MLIS technologies. It was also apparent from statements made in the course of the inspection by the Iraqi scientists and senior officials that export controls and voluntary refusals on the part of several equipment suppliers had severely hampered the Iraqi LIS activities by preventing the procurement from abroad of critical pieces of equipment, most notably copper vapour laser systems. A report on the twenty-sixth inspection mission can be found in document GOV/INF/757.
<P>         
2. At its thirty-eighth regular session, on 23 September 1994, the IAEA's General Conference adopted resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/19 commending the Director General and the IAEA's staff for their strenuous efforts to implement Security Council resolutions 687, 707, and 715 (1991) and requesting them to continue their efforts; noting that the IAEA was in a position to implement its Ongoing Monitoring and Verification Plan (the OMV Plan); stressing the need for Iraq to fully cooperate with the IAEA in achieving the complete and long term implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions especially regarding the Ongoing Monitoring and Verification Plan; noting in this connection that the IAEA retained the right to investigate further any aspects of Iraq's past nuclear weapons capability, in particular as regards any new information obtained by the IAEA and assessed as warranting further investigations; and requesting the Director General to report the views of the General Conference to the Secretary General and to report to the Board of Governors and to the thirty-ninth General Conference on his efforts to implement Security Council resolutions 687, 707 and 715 (1991).
<P>        
3. On 6 October 1994, the Director General transmitted to the United Nations Secretary-General the sixth semi-annual report on the implementation of the IAEA's Plan for Ongoing Monitoring and Verification of Iraq's compliance with paragraph 12 of resolution 687 (1991). The report concluded that, with the establishment at the end of August of the IAEA continuous presence in Iraq, all elements of the IAEA's OMV Plan were in place. The conclusion recalled that monitoring and verification measures would evolve as technical needs arose and as advanced technologies became available. The report further noted that implementation of the OMV Plan did not foreclose the exercise by the IAEA of its right to investigate any aspect of Iraq's former nuclear weapons programme, in particular through the follow-up of any new information developed by the IAEA or provided by Member States and assessed as warranting further investigation. A copy of the Director General's report can be found in document GOV/INF/753.
<P>         
4.   On 17 October 1994, the Director General addressed the forty-ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly. In presenting the IAEA's annual report he summarised the results of the IAEA's activities in Iraq as follows:
<P>         
"Since May 1991, the LAEA has carried out 26 inspection missions in Iraq under the mandate of Security Council resolution 687 (1991). Based on these inspections and the analysis of documents, samples, procurement data and other information, the course of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons programme has been thoroughly investigated and charted. As also required by resolution 687, the IAEA has completed the destruction, removal or rendering harmless of Iraq' s weapons usable materials, facilities and equipment. We are confident that, as a result of these activities, no practical capability for the production of nuclear weapons remains in Iraq.  Nevertheless the IAEA retains the right to investigate any further aspects of Iraq's former programme if new information should warrant such action. Concurrently with these mapping and dismantling activities, the IAEA has been phasing in elements of its plan for the ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with resolutions 687, 707 and 715. All the elements of the IAEA 's plan are now in place and a continuing presence of IAEA inspectors in Iraq has been established at the Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Centre, with the assistance of the UN Special Commission. Monitoring and verification measures will continue to evolve as technical needs arise and advanced technologies become available. A mechanism for monitoring future sales and supplies of designated items to Iraq has been jointly developed with the UN Special Commission in consultation with the Security Council's Sanctions Committee. Once approved by the Council, this mechanism will form an integral part of the ongoing monitoring and verification system.
<P>         
5. The twenty-seventh IAEA inspection mission under Security Council resolution 687 (1991) took place from 14 to 21 October 1994. As mentioned in paragraph 1 of this attachment, since August 1994 - i.e., concurrently with the twenty-sixth inspection mission - the IAEA had established a continuous presence in Iraq in order to fully implement the OMV Plan. This is accomplished through the stationing in Iraq of a team composed of a chief inspector and one or more experts to tours of duty at the Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Centre (BMVC) established by the United Nations Special Commission in consultation with the IAEA. This evolution in the pattern of the IAEA's activities in Iraq will entail a change in the mechanism for reporting to the IAEA's Board of Governors, which has until now been based on the issuance of GOV/INF documents containing detailed reports of each and every inspection in Iraq. It is proposed that, starting 1 January 1995, the description of the IAEA's activities in Iraq will be covered in detail only in the semi-annual reports (in April and October) to the Security Council prepared in accordance with paragraph 8 of resolution 715 (1991). These semi-annual reports will also be issued as GOV/INF documents. It should be noted, however, that the IAEA will, of course, continue to make use of large inspection teams whenever special circumstances warrant this form of inspection.
<P>         
IAEA-27 provided additional staffing resources to facilitate the carrying out of the semi-annual radiometric survey of Iraq's principal watercourses. This periodic survey is one of the components of the environmental monitoring system established under the OMV Plan to detect signature of undeclared nuclear activities in Iraq. This survey had been initiated in November 1992 when a comprehensive baseline of the natural radioactivity background of Iraqi main waterbodies was established on the basis of samples taken in more than 50 sampling locations.  
<P>         
6.   On 16 December 1994, the Director General transmitted to the UN Secretary-General the seventh semi-annual report on the implementation by the IAEA of the plan for the destruction, removal, or rendering harmless of the items specified in paragraph 12 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991) .
<P>         
This report reflected the completion of the reprocessing of the irradiated nuclear fuel removed from Iraq, which had been carried out in Russia under a contract with the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom). As provided for in this contract, Minatom has reprocessed the spent fuel and downgraded the content of the U-235 isotope to slightly below 20 percent. The recovered material, amounting to a total quantity of 141 kilograms of uranium (metal equivalent) was shipped to the designated storage site in Russia and has been verified and sampled by IAEA safeguards inspectors on 14-15 December 1994. With the completion of this operation, the IAEA plan for destruction, removal or rendering harmless of items listed in paragraph 12 of resolution 687 (1991) had come to its practical end. The IAEA retains, however, the right to destroy, remove or render harmless, as appropriate, any additional item of paragraph 12 list not previously discovered or declared. Copy of the Director General's report can be found in UN document S/1994/1438.
<P>         
7. On 5 April 1995, the Director General transmitted to the UN Secretary-General the seventh semi-annual report on the implementation of the IAEA's OMV Plan. In the summary and conclusions section of this report the Director General stated that:
<P>         
". . . [the] IAEA is confident that the essential components of Iraq 's clandestine nuclear programme have been identified and have been destroyed, removed or rendered harmless and that the scope of the past programme is well understood. This assessment is based not only on the verification of Iraqi statements, which may be presumed to be biased and incomplete, but also on information gathered during inspections, on information provided by suppliers and Member States and, to a great extent, on an analysis of the large cache of original Iraqi documentation which was seized in Iraq by the teams of the sixth and seventh IAEA inspection missions. Despite the absence in this cache of original Iraqi documentation regarding its gas centrifuge programme and the suspected withholding by Iraq of some documents from the cache, the areas of residual uncertainty, regarding Iraq's former nuclear weapons programme, have been progressively reduced to a level of detail, the full knowledge of which is not likely to affect the overall picture.
<P>         
The IAEA's extensive knowledge of the scope of Iraq's past nuclear weapons programme has facilitated the design and implementation of a credible and sustainable plan for the ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with its obligations under relevant Security Council resolutions.
<P>         
The Plan has been operational since the end of August 1994, when the continuous presence of IAEA inspectors in Iraq - the Nuclear Monitoring Group - was established. The refurbishing and modification of the Canal Hotel in Baghdad to accommodate the Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Centre is practically complete and the Centre provides adequate facilities for the implementation of the Plan.
<P>         
During the period under review [October 1994-April 1995], Nuclear Monitoring Groups have conducted more than 160 inspections at some 70 facilities, including 23 facilities not previously inspected.
<P>         
A number of requests for the release, relocation and change of use of equipment, material and facilities, to be used in non-nuclear activities, have been approved, with the concurrence of the Special Commission and in compliance with the provisions of paragraph 3 iii) of Security Council resolution 707 (1991).  Progress has been made in developing the export/import monitoring mechanism called for in paragraph 7 of resolution 715 (1991) to monitor any future sale or supply to Iraq of items relevant to the implementation of Section C of resolution 687 (1991), to the temporary restriction on nuclear activities in Iraq pursuant to paragraph 3 iv) of resolution 707 (1991) and to the Plan approved in resolution 715 fl 991)
<P>         
At the suggestion of the Sanctions Committee and in accordance with the procedures for amending the Annexes provided for in the Plan, the IAEA has revised Annex 3 thereof with the assistance of international experts on export control. The revised version reflects the need to provide customs and export control authorities with a more detailed description of items subject to notification.
<P>         
The Plan provides a sound basis for the ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with the requirements of the relevant Security Council resolutions in the area of nuclear weapons and will continue to be developed as technical needs arise and as advanced technologies become available.
<P>         
The implementation of the Plan does not foreclose the exercise by the IAEA of its right to investigate any aspect of Iraq's former nuclear weapons programme.  Indeed, vigorous exercise of the right - provided in the Plan - to immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access to any and all areas, facilities, equipment, records and means of transportation represents an important confidence-building measure.
<P>         
Recent information made available through the media suggesting the existence of a secret project which, prima facie, could be related to a nuclear weapons programme, requires further investigation to verify its authenticity. "
<P>         
At the request of the President of the Security Council, the Leader of the IAEA Action Team introduced the Director General's report to the Council at its informal meeting on 13 April 1995. The full text of the Director General's report is contained in document GOV/INF/770, dated 11 May 1995.
<P>         
8.   On 17 July 1995, the Director General transmitted to the UN Secretary-General an addendum to the seventh semi-annual report on the implementation of the OMV Plan.  This addendum had been prepared at the request of the Security Council and addressed the issue of five documents which an anonymous sender asserted to be official Iraqi documents, generated in 1993 and 1994, and which, according to the source, provided proof that a nuclear weapons programme had been reconstituted in Iraq. A lengthy investigation was undertaken by the IAEA aimed at assessing the nature and veracity of these documents. This investigation entailed a detailed analysis of the form and content of the documents, including their comparison with the extensive database of documents seized in Iraq during the sixth IAEA inspection; an in-depth analysis of current and past correspondence and records provided by Iraq; interviews with Iraqi personnel allegedly involved, or known to have relevant technical competence; interviews with private Iraqi civilians - not employed by the Government; interviews with journalists associated with the documents; and the carrying out of on-site inspection activities, including environmental monitoring, using the most sensitive analytical techniques.
<P>         
Based on the results of these activities and the IAEA's extensive knowledge of Iraq's past programme and present situation, a large number of errors and inconsistencies were identified in the documents, typified by the following:
<P>         
<LI>Linguistic correctness and conformity with Iraqi practice:
<P>         
These documents contain technical wording which differs from that found in the IAEA's extensive database of seized Iraqi documents and terms which are not in conformance with standard Iraqi usage.
<P>         
<LI>Conformity of layout and construction of documents with established Iraqi practices:
<P>         
The layout of the documents is not consistent with contemporary Iraqi usage.  In addition, the documents reveal errors in construction, suggesting poor adaptation of authentic Iraqi documents.
<P>         
<LI>Scientific validity:
<P>     
Some technical elements of the programme, inferred from the documents, have been assessed as unlikely by experts from nuclear-weapon States. Some of those elements are also inconsistent with available information on the status of Iraq's clandestine programme during the last years of the programme.
<P>         
<LI>Accuracy:
<P>         
Significant inaccuracies in qualifications, titles and names of individuals, as well as in technical and administrative organisational structures, have been clearly established.
<P>         
The investigation undertaken by the IAEA and the basis for its conclusions have been comprehensively documented. In view, however, of the sensitive nature of the subject and of the process, it is considered prudent to keep this documentation confidential.  As a result of this investigation, the IAEA has reached the conclusion that, on the basis of all available evidence, these documents are not authentic. Furthermore, no credible evidence has been found to suggest that the activities reported in these documents were or are being carried out in Iraq.
<P>         
It should be noted that the IAEA will continue, under its ongoing monitoring and verification plan, to actively pursue any evidence that might point to the conduct of activities proscribed under the relevant Security Council resolutions.
<P>         
A copy of the addendum to the seventh semi-annual report can be found in document GOV/INF/770/Add.1.
<P>         
9.    On 24 July 1995, the Chairman of the UN Sanctions Committee transmitted to the President of the Security Council the report called for in paragraph 7 of Security Council resolution 715 (1991). This report was jointly prepared by the Sanctions Committee, the Director General of the IAEA and the Special Commission and sets out a proposal for monitoring future sales or supplies by other countries to Iraq of items relevant to the implementation of Section C of resolution 687 (1991). In the covering note, the Chairman of the Sanctions Committee expressed the hope that it would be possible for the Council to take an early decision on the mechanism proposed in the report, so that preparations, as necessary, could be pursued at the national level for its implementation.

<P>
<OL>         
<LI>Last year, in resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/6, the General Conference reaffirmed "the importance to the international community of ensuring that sound practices are planned and implemented for the safe management and disposal of radioactive wastes from nuclear application technologies and nuclear power generation".
<P>         
<LI>Also in that resolution, the General Conference invited the Board of Governors and the Director General to maintain the emphasis given to radioactive waste management, especially with regard to the Agency's Radioactive Waste Safety Standards (RADWASS), and to consider what further measures should be taken to enhance international co-operation activities in the radioactive waste management field.
<P>
<LI>In addition, the General Conference requested the Board and the Director General to commence preparations for a convention on the safety of waste management and continue the process of collecting relevant background information (including appropriate RADWASS documents) that would be useful in drafting the convention.
<P>         
<LI>The General Conference further requested the Board and the Director General to report to it in 1995 on the implementation of resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/6.
<P>        
<LI>In June the Board considered a document prepared in response to the request referred to in paragraph 4 above and agreed that the document might be submitted - after necessary updating - to the General Conference. This is the updated version of that document.

<H3>Progress and Status of the Radioactive Waste Safety Standards (RADWASS) Programme</H3>
<P>         
<B>Introduction</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The Agency's Radioactive Waste Safety Standards (RADWASS) programme was established in 1991 in response to requests by Member States that the Agency demonstrate that a harmonized approach to the safe management of radioactive waste existed at the international level. The RADWASS Safety Series constitutes a hierarchy of documents headed by a Safety Fundamentals document; the programme covers six subject areas for each of which there is to be a Safety Standards document: "Planning", "Predisposal", "Near surface disposal", "Geological disposal", "Uranium mining and milling waste" and "Decommissioning". Phase I (1991-94) of the programme consisted of the preparation of the Safety Fundamentals document, four Safety Standards, five Safety Guides and two Safety Practices. Phase II (1995-96) involves the preparation of two Safety Standards and a number of Safety Guides and Safety Practices. Phase I was scheduled to be completed by the end of 1994, with Phase II starting in 1995. In practice, however, Phase I activities have extended into 1995 and work on several Phase II documents started already in 1994.
<P>         
<CENTER><B>Progress and Status</B></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>In response to requests made by some Member States, the Secretariat decided that the Safety Fundamentals document and the Safety Standards documents should be reviewed by a group of experts consisting mainly of regulators before being submitted to the Board of Governors, in order to ensure harmonization with other Agency safety-related documents and proper linkage of the Safety Standards to the Safety Fundamentals. For this purpose, the Agency's International Radioactive Waste Advisory Committee (INWAC) was extended to include a regulator from countries whose INWAC member was not a regulator (hence the references below to the "extended INWAC").
<P>
<LI>Preparation of the Safety Fundamentals document began in 1991. The process of reaching international consensus along the lines indicated in document GOV/INF/586 - on the development of the RADWASS documents - involved Consultant and Technical Committee Meetings, reviews by INWAC and the Secretariat's internal Safety Series Review Committee and formal reviews by Member States.
<P>
<LI>The draft Safety Fundamentals document "The Principles of Radioactive Waste Management" and draft Safety Standard S-1 "Establishing a National System for Radioactive Waste Management" were reviewed in September 1994 and January 1995 by the extended INWAC". The resulting drafts of the Safety Fundamentals and Safety Standard S-l, as recommended by the "extended INWAC" in January 1995, were submitted to the March 1995 session of the Board of Governors, which took note of reservations concerning paragraph 312 of the draft Safety Fundamentals document and approved the two draft documents for publication.
<P>
<LI>Three draft Safety Standards documents (S-2 "Predisposal Management of Radioactive Waste", S-3 "Near Surface Disposal of Radioactive Waste" and S-6 "Decommissioning of Nuclear Facilities") were submitted to the "extended INWAC" for review at a meeting which took place late in May 1995, but none of them was finalized for submission to the Board of Governors. Further work on them is needed.
<P>
<LI>Three Safety Guides (on "Classification of Radioactive Waste", "Siting of Near Surface Disposal Facilities" and "Siting of Geological Disposal Facilities") and one Safety Practices document (on "Application of Exemption Principles to the Recycle and Reuse of Materials from Nuclear Facilities") prepared during Phase I have been published.
<P>
<LI>With the decision to establish a Department of Nuclear Safety, which will be responsible for the preparation and review of Agency safety standards, the structure and content of the RADWASS programme are undergoing an in-depth examination with a view to harmonization of the Safety Series publications.

<H3>Convention on the Safety of Radioactive Waste</H3>
<P>
<B>Introduction</B></CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>In September 1994, the General Conference, in resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/6 on "Measures to resolve international waste management issues", invited the Board of Governors and the Director General to commence preparations for a convention on the safety of radioactive waste management. Pursuant to that resolution and as agreed by the Board of Governors at its December 1994 meetings, the Director General organized a meeting of experts from Member States with the objective of holding preliminary discussions on basic concepts and the possible scope of such a convention, and to examine working mechanisms and procedures for its preparation.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Progress and Status</B></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>A preparatory meeting took place from 20 to 22 February 1995 and was attended by 110 participants from fifty countries. The CEC, NEA/OECD and IMO were represented by observers. The Secretariat provided participants with a list of reference material and a note on conventions and other instruments that could be consulted in the preparation of a convention. The meeting heard general statements by participants and discussed the basic concepts and framework of the convention and also approaches to the preparatory process.  A list of suggestions made and questions raised during the meeting was prepared by the Secretariat in the form of a paper entitled "Inventory of Issues Raised". The meeting called for the setting up of an open-ended group of legal and technical experts and suggested that it begin early in July 1995 with preparatory work on a convention.
<P>         
<LI>A progress report entitled "Preparatory work for a convention on the safety of radioactive waste management" and summarizing the results of the February 1995 meeting was considered by the Board at its March 1995 session. The Board took note of the progress report and endorsed a proposal by the Director General that an open-ended group of technical and legal experts be convened to carry out the necessary substantive preparations for a convention.
<P>
<LI>The first meeting of the open-ended group of legal and technical experts took place from 3 to 6 July 1995. There were 128 participants from 53 countries and observers from the CEC, NEA/OECD, UNEP (Secretariat of the Basel Convention) and WHO. Professor Alec Jean Baer (Switzerland) was elected Chairman.
<P>
<LI>The open-ended group's principal objective was to identify the main substantive elements necessary in a radioactive waste safety convention, so as to have a basis for provisions to be contained in a first draft text. It was agreed that the Convention on Nuclear Safety should be the model for a "sister" convention on radioactive waste safety, which would also be an "incentive convention" and provide for reporting at meetings of the Contracting Parties and for a peer review process (albeit with national responsibility for waste management activities acknowledged).
<P>
<CENTER><B>Future Activities</B></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The open-ended group agreed on a procedure for the preparation of a Chairman's first draft convention text, to be discussed at a meeting to take place from 4 to 8 December 1995.  It also agreed that the draft text would cover "objectives", "definitions", "scope" and "obligations". Three meetings of the open-ended group are planned for 1996.

<H3>Dumping of Radioactive Waste at Sea - An Update of Progress in the International Arctic Seas Assessment Project and the Far Eastern Seas Project</H3>
<P>
<B>INTERNATIONAL ARCTIC SEAS ASSESSMENT PROJECT
<P>
Introduction</B>
</CENTER>
<OL>         
<LI>The International Arctic Seas Assessment Project (IASAP) was initiated in 1993 to address concern about the possible health and environmental impacts of radioactive wastes dumped in the shallow waters of the Arctic Seas by organizations of the former Soviet Union. The project is being executed as a part of the Agency's responsibilities under the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Convention 1972). The Board of Governors was informed about the IASAP shortly after its initiation in document GOV/INF/706-GC(XXXVII)/INF/320.
<P>
<LI>The project involves co-ordinating the technical investigations, research and analyses of Member States in order to produce an international expert assessment of the risks to human health and the environment associated with the radioactive waste dumped in the Kara Sea and the Barents Sea and of possible remedial measures and their feasibility.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Information on the dumped wastes</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>In May 1993 the Russian Federation provided information to the Agency on the high- and low-level wastes dumped in the Arctic Seas during the years 1959-92. The total amount of radioactivity dumped was reported to be more than 90 PBq (1 PBq = 1 petabecquerel), the main contribution to this total coming from the radioactivity associated with dumped submarine and icebreaker reactors containing fuel. The information has subsequently been revised and refined as a result of analyses by institutes in the Russian Federation working in collaboration with an IASAP expert group. The total estimated activity associated with the reactors at the time of dumping has been revised to 36 PBq. If radioactive decay since dumping is taken into account, the estimated total activity of the dumped reactors at the present time is about 5 PBq. The IASAP expert group has examined information provided on the state of the reactors and their protective containments when dumped, analysed the weak points of the containments and made preliminary estimates of the likely future time patterns of radionuclide release to the surrounding marine environment. This is the information needed as a basis for predicting the radiological and environmental impact of the wastes.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Co-ordination</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>Co-operation and information exchange are being maintained with other programmes (international and national) relating to the Arctic dumping issue, notably the Norwegian-Russian Expert Group, the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme and the US Arctic Nuclear Waste Assessment Programme.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Exploratory cruises</B></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The Joint Norwegian-Russian Expert Group, formed in 1992 to investigate possible radioactive contamination due to the dumped nuclear waste in the Kara Sea and the Barents Sea, organized exploratory cruises to the dumping areas in 1992, 1993 and 1994. The Agency has worked closely with the Expert Group, and its Marine Environment Laboratory in Monaco (IAEA-MEL) was represented on each of the cruises, during which most of the dumping sites were visited. Environmental samples were taken and in situ measurements made. The IAEA-MEL results confirm Member State findings that the Barents Sea and the open part of the Kara Sea are relatively uncontaminated, the main contributions being from nuclear weapons fallout and from land-based sources. At the dumping sites in the Kara Sea, localized contamination was detected in the proximity of dumped wastes. It can be concluded that the wastes are not giving rise to any significant radiological or environmental risks at the present time.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Predictive modelling and assessment</B></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>While it appears that there are no significant impacts from the dumped wastes at present, the gradual deterioration of the waste containments could lead to the release of radionuclides and possible impacts in the future. Also, since much of the wastes is lying in shallow waters, the possibility of movement and transport of the waste packages by natural events (ice or storm action) or by deliberate human activities cannot be ruled out. The time scales involved are very long, and the possible impact of climatic change has therefore also to be considered. It is necessary to acquire a thorough understanding of the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the environment surrounding the wastes and to attempt to reproduce the behaviour of released radionuclides in this environment by means of mathematical models. As part of the IASAP, laboratories in Denmark, Japan, the Netherlands, the Russian Federation, Switzerland and the United Kingdom and also the IAEA-MEL are participating in a co-ordinated research programme entitled "Modelling of the radiological impact of radioactive waste dumping in the Arctic Seas" which aims to develop realistic and reliable models for use in assessing the impact of the dumped wastes.
<P>
<CENTER><B> Remedial measures</B></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The Contracting Parties to the London Convention 1972 have requested the Agency to look into possible remedial actions and their feasibility. Some preliminary consideration has been given to the matter within the framework of the IASAP, but clearly the project can address only technical aspects such as the engineering feasibility and radiological implications of different options; it can provide the technical basis for deciding whether remediation is necessary or not, but the decision itself must be taken by relevant national authorities.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Extrabudgetary support and future work</B></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>Extrabudgetary support for the IASAP has been provided since its initiation by the United States of America, which has invited the Agency to participate on 6 September 1995 in a discussion regarding the formation of an intergovernmental forum on the Arctic Seas to be known as the Arctic Council. A final report with an assessment of the impact of the dumping and the need for remedial measures will be submitted in 1996 to the Contracting Parties to the London Convention 1972.
<P>
<CENTER><B>FAR EASTERN SEAS PROJECT</B></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>In 1994 the IAEA-MEL began participating in a joint study of radioactive waste dump sites in the Far Eastern seas along with scientists from the Russian Federation, Japan and the Republic of Korea. The reported activity of the waste dumped in this region (0.7PBq) is considerably less than that of the waste dumped in the Arctic Seas, and a joint expedition to some of the dump sites in 1994 revealed no leakages of radioactivity at those sites, the observed radionuclide levels being the result of global fallout from nuclear weapons tests.  An expedition to the Far Eastern seas to study other dump sites used in the past by the former Soviet Union, Japan and the Republic of Korea is planned for later this year, again with IAEA-MEL participation. During this expedition, a search will be made for a lost strontium-90 power source (activity 13 PBq).
<P>
<LI>Major extrabudgetary support for the IAEA-MEL is being received from Japan, particularly for comparative studies of worldwide marine radioactivity.

<H3>Building Waste Management Infrastructures</H3>
<P>
<B>Introduction</B>
</CENTER>
<OL>
<LI>Radioactive waste is generated not only in nuclear power stations and other fuel cycle activities, but also in the use of radioisotopes in medicine, research and industry. All Member States generate radioactive waste in proportion to their use of nuclear energy and nuclear applications. Assisting developing Member States to establish and maintain an adequate infrastructure for managing radioactive wastes is an essential functional part of the Agency's activities in this area.
<P>
<LI>Two areas of high priority within the Agency are infrastructure building in developing countries as they begin to use nuclear techniques and in the Newly Independent States (NISs) of the former Soviet Union and in other East European countries.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Overview</B></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The need for infrastructure building in developing Member States was strongly supported by the TC Policy Review Seminar in September 1994 and by the International Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee (INWAC) in March 1995. Waste management infrastructure building needs to be and is being co-ordinated with the radiation protection infrastructure programme and with technical assistance programmes.
<P>
<LI>One approach to infrastructure building is to develop implementation "packages" for use in all developing Member States that have common or similar infrastructure needs in order to expedite implementation and use Agency resources more efficiently. These standardized packages cover the legal, regulatory, administrative and technical areas that must be part of a national waste management programme.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Recent Activities</B></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>A categorization of developing Member States with similar uses of radioisotopes has been established to help identify common infrastructure needs. Using this categorization a set of minimum acceptable infrastructure criteria, according to the type and quantity of radioactive waste generated, has been developed by outside experts and Agency staff.
<P>
<LI>Profiles of the current waste management infrastructures in 20 developing Member States have been drafted using information from Waste Management Advisory Programme (WAMAP) and other expert missions. The development of profiles for developing Member States is a high priority as the information will assist in channelling the type of technical assistance needed to specific countries.
<P>
<LI>A TC Model Project on the upgrading of waste management infrastructures in selected Member States has been approved (project INT/9/144). A first group of six countries (Albania, Cameroon, Colombia, Ghana, Sri Lanka and Uganda) has been selected for the implementation of improvements in infrastructures for waste management (under project INT/9/144) and for radiation protection (under the corresponding Model Project on the upgrading of radiation protection, project INT/9/143).
<P>
<LI>Standard packages for upgrading different components of the waste management infrastructures in different types of developing Member States are being prepared both within the framework of the Agency's Regular Budget and under project INT/9/144. Three packages have been completed: "Reference Design for a Centralized Waste Processing and Storage Facility" (IAEA-TECDOC-776), intended for countries having waste from nuclear research reactors; "Reference Design for a Centralized Spent Sealed Sources Facility" (draft LAEA-TECDOC), intended for countries having radioactive waste from small nuclear research centres and nuclear applications; and "Sealed Radiation Sources Registry", consisting of software and supplementary documentation. Other regulatorv and technical packages are being prepared.
<P>
<LI>Within the framework of the Agency/UNDP initiative regarding assistance to NIS, there have been fact-finding missions to most of the countries in question in order to determine their waste management needs and identify priority activities that need early attention. Owing to the fact that expected UNDP funding has not materialized, it has not been possible to proceed as planned with the waste management upgrading programme.
<P>
<LI>A seminar on "International Co-operation on Nuclear Waste Management in the Russian Federation" was held in Vienna in May 1995 for the purpose of identifying waste management activities in the Russian Federation warranting additional international support.  Jointly sponsored by the Nordic Council and the Agency, the seminar provided - for the first time -an international forum devoted exclusively to a review of current and planned waste management activities in the Russian Federation and an overview of current and planned bilateral and multilateral co-operation in the waste management field. It was attended by 32 representatives of the various Russian Federation ministries and organizations involved in waste management and by representatives of 15 countries and three international institutions.  A comprehensive account was given of the waste management programmes currently under way in the Russian Federation and of their problems. The Agency will publish the proceedings of the seminar soon. A follow-up meeting is planned for 21-22 September 1995 in Stockholm, the aim being too work out further details of the proposed co-operative activities and define the role which the Agency might play in facilitating co-operation.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Future Activities</B></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The Agency is exploring with a Member State ways of establishing, in that country, a regional training centre - based on facilities already established there through an Agency technical co-operation project - suitable for demonstrating techniques for the processing and storage of radioactive waste. Member States in Europe and West Asia will benefit from the centre. This activity is a "pilot programme" which could be expanded so that a demonstration waste processing and storage facility would be available in every region. The concept is based on using facilities that already exist in Member States to provide hands-on experience to scientists, managers and technicians involved in planning and/or conducting waste management operations in developing Member States.
<P>
<LI>The upgrading of radiation protection and waste management infrastructures in two NIS will be undertaken as the first step of a broad upgrading programme.
<P>
<LI>The individual packages needed for upgrading waste management infrastructures in countries with nuclear applications and nuclear research reactors will be completed. Also, packages for countries with uranium mining and milling activities will be developed.
<P>
<LI>Action plans for the six developing Member States already selected for the upgrading of waste management infrastructures (see para. 7 above) have been prepared and will be implemented. Upgrading of the infrastructures in a second group of developing Member States will start in 1996.

<H3>Waste Management Assessment Advisory Peer Review Services</H3>
<P>
<B>Introduction</B></CENTER>
<OL>
<LI>The Agency provides international peer review (Waste Management Assessment and Technical Review Programme [WATRP]) services and waste management advisory services to Member States on request. WATRP reviews are intended primarily for technically developed components of national waste management infrastructures, mainly in advanced countries, whereas advisory missions normally review the entire waste management programmes of developing countries.
<P>
<LI>For a WATRP review, the Agency convenes an international team of experts which performs an independent peer review in accordance with terms of reference established in agreement with the requesting Member State. Such a review can help to ensure that waste management systems planned, designed or in operation are performing or will perform in a safe, reliable and technically sound manner.
<P>
<P>Advisory services are provided to developing Member States, normally within the framework of technical co-operation (TC) projects, in order to assist them in building or strengthening national waste management infrastructures and programmes. The Member States in question follow up on the advice given either by requesting technical assistance projects or by taking independent action at the national level.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Recent Activities</B></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>Recent WATRP activities include the peer reviews noted below:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>a review of the Czech Republic's deep geological disposal programme;
<LI>a review of the safety assessment of the near-surface disposal facility at Mochovce, Slovak Republic.
</UL>
<P>
A concise WATRP Handbook was prepared by the Secretariat in 1994 and sent to authorities and organizations in Member States in order to inform them about WATRP, its objective and scope, the review mechanism and estimate costs.
<P>
<LI>In 1994 there were TC-supported advisory missions to Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia (in conjunction with a RAPAT [Radiation Protection Advisory Team] mission) and Uruguay. This year there has so far been one advisory mission (to Latvia).
<P>
<CENTER><B>Future Activities</B></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>Norway has requested WATRP services in connection with the establishment of a combined storage/repository facility for low- and intermediate-level waste; the WATRP team plans to visit Norway during the period 25-29 September 1995. France has requested a review of its short-lived radioactive waste management programme, with the focus on the disposal facility in the Departement de l'Aube (Centre de Stockage de l'Aube); the mission is provisionally planned to take place in March 1996.
<P>
<LI>The Agency will continue to respond to requests from developing Member States for advisory missions.

<H2>Plan for Producing Potable Water Economically</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE=3>
<P>
<OL> 
<LI>Last year the General Conference had before it document GC(XXXVIII)/8, which summarized the progress of various studies and other actions initiated by the Agency on the topic "Plan for producing potable water economically".
<P>         
<LI>Following discussions based on information provided in document GC(XXXVIII)/8, the General Conference, in resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES17, noted the following two main conclusions of the studies initiated by the Agency: (i) "that the use of nuclear energy as an alternative option to the use of fossil fuelled plants for supplying energy for sea water desalination is technically feasible and in general economically competitive" and (ii) "that there is a need to establish a programme for identifying a practical set of options from which one or more demonstration facilities with well-defined objectives might be chosen".
<P>         
<LI>Noting also the continuing interest of a number of Member States in activities relating to seawater desalination using nuclear energy and stressing the importance of adequate water supplies for mankind, the General Conference requested the Director General to continue consultations concerning those main conclusions and called upon Member States in a position to provide expert services and extrabudgetary resources in support of the activities relating to seawater desalination using nuclear energy to make such services and resources available.
<P>         
<LI>Lastly, the General Conference decided to include in the agenda for its thirty-ninth regular session an item entitled "Plan for producing potable water economically" and requested the Director General to submit to the Conference at that session a report on progress made in response to resolution GC(XXXVII)/RES/7. This document has been prepared in response to that request.
<P>
<H3>Sea Water Desalination Feasibility Studies</H3>
<P>
<LI> With regard to the main conclusion that nuclear desalination is technically feasible and in general economically competitive, the progress made is reported on in paragraphs 6-17 below.
<P>         
<CENTER>
<B>North African feasibility study</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The North African regional feasibility study has been completed. Publication of the report is awaiting final approval by the governments of the five participating countries.
<P>         
<LI>For each of the five sites selected by the participating countries (one in each country), forecasts were made both of the future potable water demand and of the capacity of the electrical grid to which the site and the adjacent region would be connected. On the basis of the electrical grid capacity forecasts it was possible to determine the maximum allowable size of any electricity-only or dual-purpose (electricity plus heat) plant that could be considered for each site. The criterion usually applied in this connection is that, for grid stability, no single plant should have a capacity greater than 10-15% of the projected grid capacity. However, this criterion was not applied (except for setting upper limits) in the selection of suitable energy sources for the sites. Rather, the matrix of energy sources for each site was selected on the basis of more practical considerations such as the urgency of additional potable water supplies as compared to additional electricity supplies and ensuring that several energy source options were included in the study.
<P>         
<LI>For each of the sites, the following three processes were compared: the reverse osmosis (RO) process, which is coupled electrically to the energy source; the multi-effect distillation (MED) process, which is coupled thermally to the energy source; and a hybrid RO/MED process. The selection of these processes permitted a reduction in the number of options to be compared and was consistent with the conclusions concerning the relative economics of desalination technologies drawn in the technical document IAEA-TECDOC-666, "Technical and economic evaluation of potable water production through desalination of seawater by using nuclear energy and other means", issued by the Agency in September 1992.
<P>           
<LI>The economic evaluation, which, for this feasibility study, was based on costs provided by various vendors of nuclear energy sources rather than the generic costs quoted in IAEA-TECDOC-666, confirmed the conclusions regarding competitiveness drawn in that IAEA-TECDOC. For each of the five sites, ranging in potable water production requirements from 24 000 m3/day to 720 000 m3/day, a nuclear option can produce potable water at a cost similar to that of potable water produced by means of a fossil energy source.  Although not all of the possible coupling options were considered for each site, the following results were obtained:
<P>
<DL>           
<DD>(i) The RO process coupled contiguously (i.e. on the same site) with the energy source - fossil or nuclear - yielded the lowest water cost. However, neither the possible risks associated with contiguous siting nor the additional expense associated with the transport of the water from the possibly more remote nuclear site were reflected in that cost.
<P>  
<DD> (ii) The cost of water from MED plants was always higher than that of water from RO plants', and it became significantly higher if the energy source was a heat-only plant and not a dual-purpose one.
<P>           
<DD>(iii) Hybrid RO/MED plants yielded water costs between those for RO and those for MED plants.
</DL>
<P>         
<LI>In line with the generic studies described in IAEA-TECDOC-666, specific water costs (expressed in 1994 US dollars per m3 of water produced) increased as the water output requirements decreased, primarily because specific energy costs became higher. No attempt was made to seek an optimum coupling arrangement at each site in order to obtain the lowest water cost. Nevertheless, the following results were obtained:
<P>
<DL>           
<DD>(i) Water costs for RO plants coupled contiguously to nuclear energy sources ranged from about US $0.7/m3 for the largest plant (720 000 m3/day) to about US $0.9 /m3 for the smallest (24 000 m3/day).
<P>           
<DD>(ii) Water costs were some US $0.1-0.2 /m3 higher for MED plants coupled to dual-purpose energy sources than for the RO plants, depending on the size of the plant and on the size of the dual-purpose energy source.
<P>           
<DD>(iii) Both the nuclear and the fossil energy options for providing heat only for the lowest-output MED plant (24 000 m3/day) yielded water costs of about US $2.0 /m3.
<P>           
<DD>(iv) The stand-alone option for RO plants (i.e. separate siting of the energy source and the desalination process) yielded water costs US $0.02-0.04/m3 higher than those for contiguous siting. Hence, although contiguously sited RO plants yield lower water costs, the margin may not cover the additional risks and water transportation costs already identified.
</DL>
<P>         
<LI>Two sites were considered as possible sites for a large desalination plant which could serve the needs of adjacent regions in two different countries - a new site and one of the reference sites. Besides the economic benefit accruing from a large plant, the choice of either sites would help to foster regional co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy - an important goal being pursued by the countries of North Africa. Common approaches, activities such as the development of joint regulatory infrastructures, the application of common safety criteria, rules, regulations and procedures, and joint local participation and manpower development would represent a major step in achieving this goal.
<P>           
This is consistent with IAEA-TECDOC-666. It was specified for this study that the water quality should meet WHO standards. If European (EC) standards for water quality were required, however, for the RO process the specific energy consumption would be at least 10% higher - i.e. the EC water quality standards imply higher water costs. Since thermally processed desalinated water meets the EC standards, the relative ranking might be reversed if those standards were specified for the study.
<P>  
<CENTER>
<B>Other studies and related activities</B>
</CENTER>
<P>         
<LI> With regard to the feasibility study for Saudi Arabia, preparations are being made for the collection of the up-to-date data necessary for provision of the requested technical assistance and for planning the initial technical assistance phases.
<P>           
<LI>The development of a computer code which enables site-specific technical optimization and economic evaluation has been completed, and the code is now available for use in the Saudi Arabian study and other possible studies. A training course on the operation of the code has been held for a group of North African experts. Work is under way on a more detailed computer code for allocating the costs of dual-purpose plants and determining their optimum coupling.
<P>           
<LI>A small and medium reactor (SMR) status report containing up-to-date technical information on most of the SMRs being developed or designed or already commercially available has been completed and is undergoing final editing prior to publication. The North African feasibility study and previous studies have led to the conclusion that SMRs are of the most suitable size for the majority of nuclear desalination applications.
<P>           
<LI>For small nuclear plants to be economically competitive with fossil plants in applications involving low outputs of electricity, district heat or - of specific interest here - desalted water, efforts must be made to reduce the capital and operating costs and thereby the specific costs per unit of output. Accordingly, a Technical Committee on "Small reactors with minimized staffing and/or remote monitoring" has discussed issues such as safety and reliability and ways of reducing capital and operating costs.
<P>           
<LI>Given the desire for regional participation in the manufacture, construction and operation of nuclear desalination plants, an Advisory Group meeting on "Technical and economic development in seawater desalination by using nuclear energy: Emphasis on local participation" has been held, with the focus on nuclear desalination in North Africa and the Middle East. The meeting provided a forum for the participants (34 persons from 14 countries, representing both vendors and potential users) to discuss the prerequisites for local participation and the opportunities that might exist at different project phases.
<P>           
<LI>It is widely considered that there is large potential worldwide for medium-capacity (50 000-100 000 m3/day) fixed or transportable desalination plants and that such plants might be coupled to floating nuclear plants. In the light of this, a Technical Committee met recently to examine the question of "Floating nuclear plants for seawater desalination".  Among the papers presented were a number by participants from the Russian Federation describing the experience gained with small desalination plants installed on nuclear-powered icebreakers and other surface vessels.
<P>
<H3>Options Identification Programme</H3>
<P>         
<LI>With regard to the main conclusion that there is a need to establish a programme for identifying a practical set of options, the progress made is reported on in paragraphs 19-24 below.  
<P>           
<LI>A two-phase Options Identification Programme has been initiated with the help of Advisory Groups and consultants. The aim of the first phase - scheduled to be completed this year- is to evaluate data relevant to a demonstration programme. By the end of this phase the candidate combinations will have been narrowed down to those which have the greatest potential for yielding technical and economic data of general applicability. The second phase will be devoted to a detailed analysis of the most practical options for demonstration, and if sufficient funding is provided this phase will be completed in 1996, with a final report presented to the General Conference that year.
<P>           
<LI>A world list of reactors has been reviewed and screened for potential availability in the short term (within the next five years) and the medium term (within the next 10-15 years), depending on the design and licensing status of each reactor concept. Also, the list has been screened for applicability to seawater desalination after analyses of the market demand for desalted water.
<P>           
<LI>Consultants have studied the present and estimated the future market demand for desalted water, and their report points to the feasibility of large desalination plants with a capacity of 200 000-500 000 m3/day and to the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and water-short regions of the United States as the principal markets for such large facilities. They forecast that an annual average seawater desalination capacity of about 1.9 Mm3/day will be installed during the five-year period 2011-2015, making a total of 9.5 Mm3/day or more of new capacity for that period. They expect that during that period the four countries just mentioned will install new capacity of 6.3 Mm3/day, representing about two thirds of the total new capacity installed. Also, they identified several countries which, in the same time period, will require plants capable of producing 80 000-100 000 m3/day of desalted water. They expect that by the year 2015 the world's total installed desalination capacity will be greater than 35 Mm3/day, which will still cover only about 70% of the projected demand for municipal desalted water at that time.
<P>           
<LI>The market study revealed that the manufacturers of equipment for the various desalination technologies have developed their equipment on a modular basis, the maximum size of water production module for each technology being limited by considerations such as available pump capacities and transportability. Although some sizes may increase in the future, the design framework for typical modular desalination plants and typical nuclear power plants - with their coupling requirements - can be foreseen.
<P>           
<LI>An examination of the reactor types which might be used in the near term for nuclear desalination projects indicates that any project involving a nuclear reactor and a contiguous desalination plant would be a candidate for further evaluation regarding practicability as a demonstration project.
<P>  
<LI>During an Advisory Group meeting held in July 1995, several participants stated that demonstration projects were either under way or about to be initiated in their countries. It is envisaged that during the second phase of the Options Identification Programme the options identified in the first phase and also the projects described during the Advisory Group meeting will be the subject of more detailed evaluation.
<P>         
<H3>Consultations with Member States on Future Actions</H3>
<P>         
<LI>The Secretariat has continued consultations concerning the main conclusions and called upon Member States in a position to provide expert services and extrabudgetary resources to make such services and resources available.
<P>           
<LI>Pursuant to resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/7, the 21 Member States which had, during earlier contacts, displayed some interest in the Agency activities connected with nuclear desalination, including those Member States which had previously provided resources and/or expert services, were again contacted by the Secretariat. Two other Member States were also contacted, bringing the total to 23. Four responses had been received by 1 August 1995, with two countries offering the services of three experts.
<P>           
<LI>As of 1 August 1995, the Agency has two cost-free experts, one partly cost-free expert and one junior Professional working in-house on the Options Identification Programme and the Saudi Arabian feasibility study.
<P>           
<LI>Since last year, a contribution of CDN $20 000 has been received from Canada and one of US $150 000 (US $100 000 in respect of 1995 US and $50 000 in respect of 1996) has been received from the Republic of Korea.2 With these contributions, the extrabudgetary resources made available for the Agency's nuclear desalination activities now total about US $735 000.
<P>           
<LI>The US $150 000 from the Republic of Korea has been designated specifically for the Options Identification Programme.

<B>Report by the Director General to the Board of Governors<BR>
and to the General Conference</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<OL>
<LI>In resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/8, the General Conference last year stressed "the need, in conformity with the Statute, to strengthen technical co-operation activities and also their effectiveness and efficiency" and requested the Director General "to present, in consultation with Member States, new initiatives to strengthen the technical co-operation activities of the Agency through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving the scientific and technological capabilities of developing countries in the fields of peaceful applications of nuclear energy and achieving sustainable development". It further requested the Director General to continue to take follow-up actions on initiatives approved by the Board and the General Conference, including the model project approach.  
<P>
<LI>In addition, the General Conference requested the Director General to report on the implementation of the resolution to the Board of Governors periodically and to the General Conference at its thirty-ninth regular session under an agenda item entitled "Strengthening of the Agency's technical co-operation activities".
<P>
<LI>The Director General reported on follow-up actions to the Third Technical Co-operation Policy Review Seminar (held in September 1994) to the Technical Assistance and Co-operation Committee in November and to the Board of Governors in December.  Also, he reported on measures being taken to strengthen technical co-operation at the March and June 1995 sessions of the Board. Finally, the present document has been prepared for the consideration both of the Board and of the General Conference.
<P>
<B>Developments since the General Conference's 1994 session</B>
<P>
<LI>Several initiatives have been taken by the Secretariat in consultation with Member States since the last General Conference session. They relate to:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>radiation protection and radioactive waste management
<DD>Country Programme Frameworks
<DD>the Model Project concept and the concept of the Agency as a "Partner in Development" a new Special Training Programme the establishment of a Standing Advisory Group on Technical Assistance and Co-operation (SAGTAC).
</DL>
<P>
The initiatives relating to radiation protection and radioactive waste management and to Country Programme Frameworks derive from recommendations made at the Third Technical Co-operation Policy Review Seminar.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Radiation protection and radioactive waste management (1)</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>At the Third Technical Co-operation Policy Review Seminar, the question was examined of establishing Action Plans for the development of radiation protection and radioactive waste management infrastructures in developing Member States, and the recommendations made at the Seminar helped in the formulation of follow-up activities and the development of strategies that were outlined to the Technical Assistance and Co-operation Committee in November and approved by the Board of Governors in December.
<P>
<LI>The preparation of a comprehensive plan covering these two fields has been initiated.  The goal is an ambitious one: to upgrade by the year 2000 the radiation protection and radioactive waste management infrastructures in all Member States where the minimum standards have not yet been met. Some elements of the plan are already being implemented.
<P>
<LI>To facilitate the identification of common infrastructure needs, developing Member States have been classified according to the uses which they make of radioisotopes, those engaged in similar radioisotope applications being grouped together. On the basis of the types and amounts of radioactivity involved, minimum radiation protection and radioactive waste management requirements have been determined by Agency staff and outside experts.  Several technical co-operation activities, including two Model Projects, have been initiated in order to assist Member States in meeting these requirements in the most direct and efficient way.
<P>
<LI>Profiles of existing radiation protection and radioactive waste management infrastructures are being prepared using information from reports on RAPAT, WAMAP and other expert missions. Profiles of radiation protection infrastructures will be prepared for most developing Member States and of radioactive waste management infrastructures for about 20. Efforts to create a computerized country profile database relating to radiation protection and radioactive waste management are under way.
<P>
<LI>A group of six countries (Albania, Cameroon, Colombia, Ghana, Sri Lanka and Uganda) has been selected for the implementation of improvements in infrastructures for radioactive waste management and radiation protection under a Model Project approved by the Board in 1994. Action Plans have been finalized for radiation protection activities and are in preparation for radioactive waste management activities.  Plans to upgrade infrastructures in a second group of Member States whose infrastructures do not meet the minimum requirements set in the International Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources (Interim edition - Safety Series No. 115-I) are to be initiated during 1995.
<P>
<LI>Standard packages for upgrading different components of radioactive waste management and radiation protection infrastructures are being prepared, both within the framework of the Agency's Regular Budget and under technical co-operation project INT/9/144. Three packages have been completed: "Reference Design for a Centralized Waste Processing and Storage Facility" (IAEA-TECDOC-776), intended for countries having waste from nuclear research reactors; "Reference Design for a Centralized Spent Sealed Sources Facility", intended for countries having radioactive waste from small nuclear research centres and nuclear applications; and "Sealed Radiation Sources Registry".
<P>
<CENTER>
<H4>Country Programme Frameworks</H4>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>Another important question examined during the Third Technical Co-operation Policy Review Seminar was how best to ensure that the Agency's technical assistance is in line with Member States' national development goals and priorities.
<P>
<LI>There was agreement that Medium-Term Country Plans for the use of nuclear technology in support of national development objectives could provide the necessary frames of reference and strategies for countries' programmes of technical co-operation with the Agency. Member States were encouraged to prepare such plans, but it was agreed that in the absence of formal Medium-Term Country Plans other relevant documents could be used.  By the end of July 1995, however, only six Medium-Term Country Plans had been received from Member States.
<P>
<LI>It was recommended that, on the basis of Medium-Term Country Plans or other relevant documents and of information received from Member States, the Secretariat elaborate a concise Country Programme Framework (CPF) for Agency technical co-operation with each recipient country, the CPF indicating the areas where nuclear applications could play a significant role in the achievement of national development objectives and where the Agency should therefore concentrate its technical co-operation efforts and resources.  The CPFs, covering a period of 4-6 years, would be elaborated in close collaboration with the governments concerned and endorsed by them. They would be working documents providing a frame of reference for future projects and a basis for project design. The primary reason for introducing CPFs is to establish the basic principles of the Model Project initiative as the dominant feature of the Agency's entire technical co-operation programme and thus to enhance the programme's social and economic impact.  Also, CPFs are intended to:
<P>
improve liaison between the Agency and governments through a clear joint commitment to priority activities;
<P>
facilitate co-ordination with other UN organizations at the country level; and
<P>
enable the Agency to mobilize more resources for its technical co-operation programme.
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat has addressed letters to Member States announcing its plans for the elaboration of CPFs and requesting that, where possible, Member States provide the Secretariat with documents such as national medium-term development plans. Also, it has developed preliminary guidelines for the preparation of the CPFs. Seven CPF missions (to Belarus, Croatia, Kazakhstan, Madagascar, the Philippines, Romania and Zimbabwe) have already been carried out, and there are plans for nine more this year and for about 15 in 1996. As the Secretariat already has sufficient information to elaborate CPFs for a number of Member States without fielding missions, it is estimated that by the end of the 1997-98 programme cycle CPFs will have been elaborated for most Member States receiving Agency technical assistance.

<B>Model Projects and the Agency as a "Partner in Development"</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The major effort to broaden the principal objective of the Agency's technical co-operation programme from infrastructure-building to the achievement of social and economic goals is continuing. The strategy, outlined at the 1994 session of the Technical Assistance and Co-operation Committee and discussed in informal meetings with various groups of Member States, is based on the premise that Model Projects are the central< mechanism for establishing a "partnership in development" between Member States and the Agency, which is offering models of how nuclear-based technologies can produce lasting and visible benefits.
<P>
<LI>In December 1994 the Board of Governors approved 11 Model Projects, bringing to 23 the total number of such projects being implemented by the Secretariat. Several of the 11 new Model Projects were proposed by Member States in the light of the experience gained during 1994 with such projects. The others were initiated by the Secretariat, but the project proposals were finalized in close co-operation with the prospective recipient countries.
<P>
<LI>The current Model Projects illustrate ways in which significant social and/or economic impacts can be achieved in the following areas: 
<P> 
Radiation protection; <BR>
Radioactive waste management;<BR>
Food production;<BR>
Groundwater resources development;<BR>
Geothermal resources development;<BR>
Insect pest eradication;<BR>
Food irradiation;<BR>
Nutrition;<BR>
Nuclear medicine;<BR>
Radiotherapy and medical physics;<BR>
Human tissue banking;<BR>
Nuclear power plant safety;<BR>
Regulation of nuclear activities<BR>
Industrial-scale applications of electron beam technology.
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat is continuing to refine the Model Project concept, focusing on the formulation of project objectives in such a way that the Agency and Member States can determine whether they are being achieved and on the development of performance indicators for use in assessing progress.  
<P>
<LI> As Model Projects require more rigorous planning, organization, co-ordination and technical support than traditional projects, the Model Project initiative has led to major improvements in the design and management of the technical co-operation programme by the Agency and recipient Member States. The result is projects which are better budgeted and more realistically planned and which should therefore be more effective.
<P>
<LI>In addition, the Model Project initiative has led to a series of related initiatives for strengthening the technical co-operation programme as a whole.  One such initiative, currently at an early stage, is the development of sectoral or thematic programming activities around "technology packages" designed to facilitate the application of standardized nuclear technologies in specific development sectors.
<P>
<LI>The strengthening of collaboration with other organizations active in the development field and the mobilization of additional resources are other offshoots of the Model Project initiative:
<P>
(a) As urged by the Board of Governors, the Secretariat is working to achieve more effective collaboration between the Agency and other international organizations. The Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture provides a natural link with FAO, and major collaboration is under way in the area of food security and in the control or eradication of the tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis in Africa. The "National radiotherapy and nuclear medicine network" Model Project in Ghana (GHA/61009) is being co- ordinated with WHO's National Cancer Control Programme in that country, and similar collaboration will be established in respect of other countries. The Agency has been approached by WHO regarding collaboration in the field of nutrition. Preparations are being made for collaboration with UNIDO in examining the industrialization potential of certain processes for the large-scale rearing of sterile insects for release in pest eradication programmes. The Agency is also collaborating with UNESCO/IOC<B>(2)</B>, UNEP, WMO, UNDP and the World Bank in a project entitled "Environmental restoration of the Black Sea". In addition, the Agency is attempting to develop (in collaboration with these same organizations) a similar project on pollution in the Caspian Sea.
<P>
(b) The Agency is seeking closer relations with major organizations involved in development funding. Links are being established with the World Bank, with regional development banks such as the African Development Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank and with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). Also, more active collaboration is being sought with major bilateral development agencies. In addition, new resource mobilization strategies are being pursued with a view to the greater utilization of the resources of the UN system (mainly UNDP and the World Bank) and the European Community.
<P>
<CENTER>
<H4>Special Training Programme</H4>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat recently launched a training programme aimed at developing the human resource base of - primarily- least developed countries in the field of peaceful applications of nuclear energy. This initiative arose from an evaluation of technical co- operation with least developed Member States carried out in 1993 by the Secretariat and decisions taken subsequently by the Board of Governors. This Special Training Programme, which will supplement existing short-term on-the-job training related to ongoing technical co- operation projects, will give graduates from - primarily- least developed countries an opportunity to perform research on topics not available in their home countries and obtain an advanced degree or a specialized qualification. The term "special" denotes the fact that the training, which would extend over several years, would be split between an institution in an "advanced" country and the trainee's home institution, with which the trainee would therefore remain in contact; in the course of the training, the trainee might even help to solve problems being encountered by his/her home institution.<B>(3)</B> The programme is a further way of arranging for an institution in a least developed country and one in an "advanced" country to co-operate as "sister organizations" in a specific application of nuclear technology. 
<P>
<LI>The programme will be based on the award of fellowships which each have a total duration of up to 18 months but which may be broken down into several short periods to accommodate the training that takes place abroad. The fellowship awards will include provision for the purchase of books and for participation in conferences, workshops etc.  related to the research in question. The Agency will pay for up to two monitoring visits by each trainee's supervisor and for minor laboratory supplies.  
<P> 
<LI>To date, the applications of about ten candidates (from Ethiopia, Liberia, Sudan and Zaire) have been approved, and applications from Ghana, Uganda and Zimbabwe are being processed. Two "advanced" institutions - the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Italy and Uppsala University in Sweden - are already participating in the programme, and it is expected that they will be joined by institutions in Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.
<P>
<CENTER> 
<B>Standing Advisory Group on Technical Assistance and Co-operation</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>At the Board's March 1995 session, the Director General put forward the idea of establishing a Standing Advisory Group on Technical Assistance and Co-operation (SAGTAC)- a new mechanism for the regular review and assessment of the technical co-operation programme and related activities. The idea was endorsed by the Board.
<P>
<LI>It is envisaged that, besides regularly reviewing and assessing the technical co-operation programme and related activities, SAGTAC will advise on technical co-operation policies and strategies, on the direction of the technical co-operation programme and on measures for increasing the programme's effectiveness and efficiency. SAGTAC will be asked in that connection to identify areas which are of particular relevance to developing countries and require special action or attention on the part of the Agency and its policy- making organs.
<P>
<LI>On 11 May 1995 the Secretariat addressed to Member States a Note setting out the terms of reference and other provisions for the establishment and functioning of SAGTAC and inviting Member States to nominate candidates to serve on it. At its June 1995 session, the Board expressed the hope that the formalities for constituting SAGTAC would soon be completed by the Director General.
<P>
<LI>SAGTAC will have 12 members with wide experience in the peaceful uses of atomic energy or in the management and funding of technical assistance and co-operation activities.  The selection of members from among the candidates nominated by Member States has started, and it is expected that SAGTAC will hold its first session before the end of 1995.
<P>
<B>Internal management practices</B>
<P>
<LI>Against the background of the various initiatives outlined above, the improvement of internal management practices is a major objective of the Secretariat, which has been endeavouring to streamline procedures so that resources may be released for high-priority activities. Project management and project co-ordination in the Department of Technical Co-operation have been re-examined, and it has been concluded that the use of more up-to- date computerized management systems would result in significantly greater effectiveness and efficiency. An amount of US $650 000 from the Regular Budget has been made available in this connection, and an assessment of user requirements has been initiated. It is expected that a fully fledged Project Information Management System will be operational by the end of 1996.
<P>
<LI>The use of more up-to-date computerized management systems will not, however, appreciably reduce the need for additional staff in the Department of Technical Co-operation in order to deal with the greater workload involved in achieving higher technical co-operation programme quality and improving programme delivery.
<P>
<B>Outlook</B>
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat will, in response to the wishes of the General Conference and the Board of Governors, seek to consolidate the initiatives already taken and continue- with further initiatives - its efforts to strengthen the Agency's technical co-operation activities.  However, it will be successful only if its efforts are matched by an equally strong commitment to the technical co-operation programme on the part of Member States in terms of resources and implementation support.

<H2>An African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone</H2>
<B>Report by the Director General to the General Conference</B>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE=3>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>In Resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/17 on this subject, the General Conference last year:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
commended the African States "for their efforts towards the establishment of an African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone" and requested the Director General "to continue to assist them in this regards".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
In the latter connection the resolution also requested the Director General:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"to report on the implementation of this resolution to the General Conference at its thirty-ninth regular session  under an agenda item entitled 'An African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone'."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This report is pursuant to that request.
<P>
<LI>In Resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/17, the General Conference welcomed specifically the progress made towards the conclusion of a treaty on an African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone on the basis of the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa, adopted by the Summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) at its first ordinary session, held in Cairo from 17-21 July 1964, and of resolution A/RES/48/86 adopted on 16 December 1993 by the General Assembly of the United Nations. In that respect it may be recalled that, in 1993, the United Nations asked the Agency to help the Group of Experts designated by the United Nations in co-operation with the OAU by preparing draft treaty provisions relevant to verification requirements in a future NWFZ in Africa. The Agency did so. Last year's report to the General Conference (document GC(XXXVIII/13) explained the Agency's activities to this regard. A senior Agency official had participated in the meetings of the Group of Experts held at Windhoek from 16 to 25 March 1994 and Addis Ababa from 11 to 14 May 1994 and assisted with work on draft treaty provisions as relevant to verification.
<P>         
<LI>On 19 December 1994 the United Nations General Assembly adopted a further resolution 49/138, which inter alia requested the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in consultation with the Organization of African Unity (OAU), to take action to enable the Group of Experts to finalize the drafting of a treaty on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa.  Subsequently, the United Nations again requested the Director General of the Agency to assist the Group of Experts in finalizing the draft treaty.
<P>         
<LI>Thus, pursuant to the request in resolution (GC(XXXVIII)/RES/17 and as further requested by the United Nations, the Assistant Director General for External Relations participated in the further meeting of the Expert Group held in Pelindaba, South Africa from 29 May to 2 June 1995. This was in order to help the Group of Experts to continue to prepare draft treaty provisions pertaining to verification requirements in a future NWFZ in Africa.
<P>         
<LI>At Pelindaba, the Group of Experts reached agreement on the draft text of a treaty establishing an African NWFZ. This text, inter alia, would entrust to the Agency the task of verifying compliance with the peaceful use undertakings of the parties to the Zone. The report of the Group of Experts and the draft treaty were considered by the meetings of the OAU Council of Ministers and of the African Heads of State which took place in Addis Ababa from 21 June to 28 June 1995. The draft treaty will be submitted to the fiftieth session of the United Nations General Assembly.

<B>Introduction</B>
<OL>
<LI>Pursuant to paragraph 3 of resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/12 ("Staffing of the Agency's Secretariat") adopted by the General Conference on 23 September 1994, the Director General presents in this report information on the measures taken to implement that resolution and statistical data on the Professional staffing situation in the Secretariat.
<P>
<LI>In response to the request made by a number of delegations during the General Conference's 1994 session for separate reports on the recruitment of staff from developing Member States (resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/12) and the representation of women in the Secretariat (resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/13), the present report deals only with the former issue, although the two issues are interrelated. In order to avoid duplication, however, the present report contains some material (text and data) relevant to the representation of women in the Secretariat which is not reproduced in document GOV/2824-GC(39)/16 dealing with  that issue.  
<P> 
<LI>The report first states the objective set by the Conference and describes measures taken to increase the number of staff members drawn from developing areas in the Professional and higher categories. It then provides statistical data (with technical explanations) and reviews the progress made in achieving the objective set by the General Conference.
<P>
<B>Objective set and measures taken</B>
<P>
(a) Objective set
<P>
<LI>In resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/12 the General Conference requested the Director General "to take specific measures with the assistance of Member States, in keeping with the provisions of Article VII of the Statute, within the period of four years as specified in resolution GC(XXXVII)/RES/621 to recruit an increased proportion of staff members drawn from developing countries, particularly at the senior and policy-making levels".
<P>
(b) Measures taken
<P>
<LI>In an effort to achieve the objective set by the General Conference, a variety of measures were taken during the past year:
<P>
(i) The implementation of resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/12 was regularly reviewed at Director General's Meetings on the basis of reports presented by the Director of Personnel. On several occasions, the Director General restated the policy that applicants from developing Member States and from those other Member States which are under-represented should, in keeping with the provisions of Article VII of the Statute, be given preference in cases of comparable qualifications and suitability, and he requested Department Heads to bear this policy in mind when making selections.
<P>
(ii) The Director of Personnel closely monitored the selection process and referred appointment proposals tack to Departments in cases where, in his opinion, applicants from developing Member States had not received the appropriate special attention. In addition, the Advisory Panel on Professional and G-8 Staff reviewed appointment proposals with this policy in mind.
<P>
(iii)  The programme budgets for 1994 and 1995 included provision for three Junior Professional Officer (JPO) positions to serve as training opportunities for persons from developing Member States who might later apply for regular positions or use the experience gained in their home countries.  Also, a further JPO position was created in 1995 with funds that became available for deferred programme implementation.  
<P> 
(iv) A roster of well-qualified and qualified applicants from developing countries is being used by the Division of Personnel in dealing with vacant fixed-term Secretariat positions.
<P>
(v) A roster of recruitment sources, especially in developing countries, is being developed with a view to establishing and maintaining direct contacts with well-qualified candidates who might be interested in applying for a position in the Secretariat.  
<P> 
(vi) The Secretariat has been examining the Agency's recruitment instruments with a view to ensuring that they facilitate the recruitment process, particularly with regard to applicants from developing countries. As a result, the personal history form is being revised and a recruitment brochure which emphasizes the interest of the Agency in receiving an increased number of applications from well-qualified applicants from developing countries is being drafted for circulation to the aforementioned recruitment sources in Member States.
<P>
<B> Statistical data and review of progress</B>
<P>
<LI>In the statistical part of this document, Annexes I to V contain staffing data by area and country for all Member States; Annexes VI to XI focus on the representation of developing countries on the Secretariat staff; and Annexes XII to XIV contain statistics on staff drawn from countries belonging to the Group of 77. In most cases, the reference date is 1 August 1995. Information relating to the staffing situation at four other reference dates (I September 1981, 1 September 1985, 1 September 1989 and I August 1994) is also given in order that trends in the composition of the Agency's staff may be assessed.
<P>
<LI>In this report, the Secretariat has used the definition of "developing country" used by the Statistical Division of the Department of Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis of the United Nations Secretariat in its "World Economic and Social Survey".
<P>
<LI>The data regarding the representation of countries belonging to the Group of 77 have been adjusted in order to reflect the current membership of the Group.
<P>
(a) Geographical distribution and principles guiding the recruitment of staff
<P>
<LI>As in the past, the data provided in this document relate to staff members in posts "subject to geographical distribution" - which, in accordance with the practice followed throughout the United Nations system, means essentially regular posts in the Professional and higher categories held by staff members who have been appointed for a period of at least one year by the Director General following standard recruitment procedures (i.e. the circulation of a vacancy notice, competitive selection and government sponsorship). Excluded are staff members in posts requiring specific linguistic skills (i.e.  translators, revisers and editors), staff members appointed after inter-agency consultations (i.e. the physicians in the VIC Medical Service) and staff members recruited under the special procedures (e.g. cost-free experts, extrabudgetary staff, temporary staff, consultants, Technical Co-operation experts and departmental administrative officers). Thus, the total number of posts subject to geographical distribution on 1 August 1995 was 702.
<P>
<LI>Out of these 702 posts, 80 were vacant on 1 August 1995.  The number of staff members subject to geographical distribution on 1 August 1995 was therefore 622.
<P>
<LI>The Agency does not have "quotas" or "desirable ranges" for staff recruitment purposes. The guiding principles for recruitment are laid down in Article VII.D of the Statute. The paramount consideration is to secure employees of the highest standards of efficiency, technical competence and integrity. Subject to this consideration, due regard is paid to the contributions of Member States to the Agency and the importance of recruiting staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible.
<P>
<LI>For exclusively internal information and for assessing the appropriateness of the nationality distribution of the staff, the Secretariat maintains a pro forma record of post allocations based on Member States' contributions towards the Agency's Regular Budget and compares it with the actual staff nationality distribution.
<P>
(b) General observations on the staffing situation and distribution of staff by area
<P>
<LI>The total number of staff in the Professional and higher categories subject to geographical distribution increased by one between 2 August 1994 and 1 August 1995 and by nine during the six-year period between 2 September 1989 and 1 August 1995, whereas during the eight-year period between 2 September 1981 and 1 September 1989 it increased by 132 (27.4%).
<P>
<LI>During the period between 2 September 1981 and 1 August 1994, the percentage of America, Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, and South East Asia and the Pacific increased significantly, whereas the percentage of staff drawn from North America, Western Europe and Eastern Europe declined. There have been no significant changes in the distribution of staff by area in 1995, but rather a confirmation of the trends observed in previous years for most areas, with the exceptions of a slight increase in the percentage representation of North America and a slight decrease in the percentage representation of the Middle East and South Asia.
<P>
(c) Progress with regard to staff drawn from developing countries
<P>
<LI>There was a slight decrease (0.4%) in the percentage representation of developing Member States during the period between 2 August 1994 and l August 1995. However, six candidates from developing Member States who have been selected for appointment as of 1 August 1995 are not yet on board. Should they join the Agency on the agreed dates of entry on duty, the percentage representation of developing Member States at the end of September will be 32.3% - a 0.1% increase compared to the 1 August 1994 level. As can be seen from Annex VI, the percentage representation of developing Member States increased over the period 2 September 1981-1 August 1995 from 16.6% to 31.8% - an increase of close to 100% in 14 years. Most of this increase (from 16.6% in 1981 to 29.0% in 1989) occurred during the period 1981 -89, during which the total number of staff members in the Professional and higher categories increased by 132 (see para. 13 above).  The relative stability since 1989 in the representation both of developing and of other Member States on the staff of the Secretariat is due to the fact that most recruitment has been for the purpose of replacing staff members who have left the Agency.
<P>
<LI>There were no changes in the representation of developing Member States at senior levels (Directors and Deputy Directors General) during the period August 1994-August 1995.  As can be seen from Annex VII, the increase was from 25.9% to 30.3% over the period September 1981 -August 1995.
<P>
<LI> During the period August 1994 - August 1995, 68 persons separated from and 69 were appointed to posts subject geographical distribution - a net increase of one. Of those who separated from such posts, 20 - or 29.4% - were nationals of developing Member States. Of the appointees, 18 - or 26.1 % - were nationals of developing Member States (see Annex III).
<P>
<LI>As can be seen from Annex VIII, the percentage representation of developing Member States is higher in scientific and technical areas (34.3%) than in administrative areas (27.4%), except with regard to Technical Co-operation Administrators. In scientific and technical areas, the percentage representation of developing Member States is particularly high among Nuclear Physicists and Physicists (34.5%), Nuclear Safeguards Inspectors (38.1%) and Life Scientists (39.3%)
<P>
<LI>Of the 2195 outside applications received during the period August 1994-August 1995 for 31 vacant administrative posts (see Annex IX), 862 - 39.3%  were from nationals of developing countries. Of these candidates, 3.9% were assessed as well-qualified; the percentage for other Member States was 4.9%. Well-qualified applicants from developing countries accounted for 34.3 % of the total number of well-qualified applicants, while 31.8% of the administrative positions for which selections were made went to applicants from developing countries.
<P>
<LI>Of the 962 outside applications received for 39 vacant engineering and scientific posts (see Annex IX), 296 - 30.8% - were from nationals of developing countries. Of these candidates, 6.4% were assessed as well-qualified; the percentage for other Member States was 13.1%. Well-qualified applicants from developing countries accounted for 17.9% of the total number of well-qualified applicants, while 20% of the engineering and scientific positions for which selections were made went to applicants from developing countries.
<P>
<LI>During the period August 1992-August 1995, on average 50 outside applications (three of them from well-qualified candidates) were received in response to each of the 214 advertised vacancies for administrative and engineering/scientific posts subject to geographical distribution. For 50% of the advertised vacancies, the number of applications received ranged from 20 to 50. This relatively low number of outside applications, particularly from well- qualified applicants and for engineering/scientific posts, reflects the increasing difficulties encountered in the recruitment of high-caliber candidates due to the deterioration in the competitiveness of the UN Common System remuneration. These difficulties are also reflected by the growing number of selected candidates who reject offers of appointment or request an initial within-grade step increase in order to match their current salary.<B>(1)</B>
<P>
<CENTER>
<H4>The government sponsorship practice</H4>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The government sponsorship practice has existed since the Agency's inception over thirty years ago. At that time the Agency was in particular need of qualified technical staff; and the Board of Governors therefore called upon Member States to put forward competent candidates from their national civil services or semi-public organizations, where the required qualifications could be found, so as to secure "employees of the highest standards of efficiency, technical competence, and integrity", as prescribed by Article VII.D of the Agency's Statute. From being primarily a necessary recruitment instrument at the outset, the government sponsorship practice developed over the years and became also a useful instrument for ascertaining that a candidate's credentials are correct and that any facts known to national authorities which might cast doubts on a candidate's integrity are brought to the attention of the Agency. At the same time, however, the government sponsorship practice has on occasions made it more difficult for the Director General to appoint the best qualified candidates and to implement the General Conference resolutions relating to the representation of developing countries and of women in the Secretariat. During the past ten years, for instance, the Agency has been denied the services of 39 well-qualified applicants, 16 of them
from developing Member States, for lack of government sponsorship. Although governments and Permanent Missions may have an interest in a particular vacancy, for which they have transmitted applications from their nationals, the government sponsorship practice should not, in the Secretariat's view, be taken to mean that a Member State can approve or veto the appointment of a particular candidate. Rather, it should be seen as a means of helping the Agency to obtain a sufficient number of applications from suitably qualified candidates and to verify the candidates' credentials and integrity. The final decision to appoint a particular candidate to a given post should at all times be the prerogative of the Director General.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
<LI> Measures of the kind taken in response to resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/12 will continue to be taken by the Secretariat, which urges all Member States to assist it by nominating more candidates who are suitably qualified for vacant positions.

Introduction
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Pursuant to paragraph 1 of resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/13 ("Women in the Secretariat") adopted by the General Conference on 23 September 1994, the Director General presents in this report information on the measures taken to implement that resolution and statistical data on the status of women in the Secretariat.
<P>
<LI>In response to the request made by a number of delegations during the General Conference's 1994 session for separate reports on the representation of women in the Secretariat (resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/13) and the recruitment of staff from developing Member States (resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/12), the present report deals only with the former issue although the two issues are interrelated.  In order to avoid duplication, however, some material (text and data) relevant to the representation of women in the Secretariat which appears in document GOV/2823-GC(39)/15 is not reproduced in the present report.
<P>
<LI>The report first states the objective set by the Conference and describes measures taken to increase the representation of women from all geographic areas, and particularly from developing Member States, in the Professional and higher categories. It then provides statistical data (with explanations) and reviews the progress made in achieving the objective set by the General Conference. The report touches on some measures and data that also are relevant to female staff members in the General Service (GS) category.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
Objective set and measures taken
<P>
(a) Objective set
<P>
4. In resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/13 the General Conference requested the Director General "to continue his efforts, in keeping with the provisions of Article VII of the Statute, to rectify the existing imbalance in the representation of women in the Professional and higher categories, particularly at the senior and policy-making levels, as well as in posts requiring scientific and technical qualifications, and from developing countries".
<P>
5. It further requested the Director General "to continue the work done in respect of the areas identified in operative paragraph 3 of resolution GC(XXXVII)/RES/622)" and "to complete the action plan referred to in operative paragraph 4 of resolution GC(XXXVII)/RES/622 and to make recommendations for consideration by the Board".
<P>
(b) Measures taken
<P>
6. In an effort to achieve the objective set by the General Conference, a variety of measures were taken during the past year:
<P>
(i) The implementation of resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/13 was regularly reviewed at Director General's Meetings on the basis of reports presented by the Director of Personnel. On several occasions, the Director General restated the policy that female applicants - especially those from developing Member States - should be given preference, in keeping with the provisions of Article VII of the Statute, in cases of comparable qualifications and suitability, and he requested Department Heads to bear this policy in mind when making selections.
<P>
(ii); The Director of Personnel closely monitored the selection process and referred appointment proposals back to Departments in cases where, in his opinion, female applicants - and especially female applicants from developing Member States - had not received the appropriate special attention. In addition, the Advisory Panel on Professional and G-8 Staff reviewed appointment proposals with this policy in mind.
<P>
(iii) The Director General communicated to all Department Heads and Division Directors a "Statement on the Status of Women in the Secretariats of the United Nations system" which was adopted by the Administrative Committee on Co-ordination (ACC) in March 1995 and in which the members of ACC reaffirm their strong commitment to ensuring that the advancement of women is a policy priority within organizations of the Common System and to taking measures to improve the status of women in their respective Secretariats.
<P>
(iv)  The programme budgets for 1994 and 1995 included provision for three Junior Professional Officer (JPO) positions to serve as training opportunities for persons from developing Member States who might later apply for regular positions or use the experience gained in their home countries, and three women were appointed to those positions. A further JPO position was created in 1995 with funds that became available for deferred programme implementation, but a man was appointed to this position.
<P>
(v) A roster of suitably qualified women is being used by the Division of Personnel in dealing with vacant fixed-term Secretariat positions.
<P>
(vi) Resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/13 was brought to the attention of Member States by means of a Note Verbale dated 5 July 1995 in which Member States were requested both to encourage women to apply for vacant positions in the Secretariat and to provide the Secretariat with the names of female experts who could be included in a technical co-operation expert roster and then recruited for field assignments.
<P>
(vii) A policy for preventing sexual harassment (promulgated in February 1994) has been initiated and a panel of five complaints officers/mediators has been established to deal with complaints about sexual harassment and unfair or discriminatory treatment. A two-day training course on conflict resolution skills was held in February 1995 for the complaints officers/mediators. The complaints officers/mediators and the Division of Personnel maintain regular contact in order to ensure effective implementation of the policy.
<P>
(viii) There has been considerable effort to increase the number of women carrying out expert missions for the Agency and the number of fellowships awarded to women.<B>(1)</B>
<P>
(ix) In response to operative paragraph 4 of resolution GC(XXXVII)/RES/622, in which the Director General was requested to seek additional voluntary contributions for the development of an action plan designed to improve the representation of women - and particularly women from developing Member States - in the Secretariat, one Member State provided a cost-free expert for a period of six months starting on 1 June 1994. The expert submitted a report which resulted in an action plan endorsed by the Joint Advisory Committee on 3 April 1995 and approved by the Director General on 17 May 1995. The same Member State is providing a second cost-free expert for a period of six months starting 29 May 1995 to advise on and assist with the implementation of the aforementioned action plan.
<P>
(x) The Secretariat has arranged to be represented at the Fourth World Conference on Women, which is taking place in Beijing in September, by a senior female official and by the cost-free expert referred to in the last sentence of sub- paragraph (ix) above.
<P>
7. In addition to the measures described above, as a result of the aforementioned action plan a roster of recruitment sources (including associations of women working in science and technology), especially in developing countries, is being developed with a view to establishing and maintaining direct contacts with well-qualified candidates who might be interested in applying for a position in the Secretariat; a new career development programme for staff in the GS category (the Temporary Assignment Programme, designed to help GS staff members broaden their experience and explore career options within the Secretariat while helping to meet temporary staffing needs in different Departments) was launched in April 1995;
<P>
the Secretariat has been examining the Agency's recruitment instruments with a view to ensuring that they facilitate the recruitment process, particularly with regard to female applicants, and as a result the personal history form is being revised and a recruitment brochure which emphasizes the interest of the Agency in receiving an increased number of applications from well-qualified women, and especially women from developing countries, is being drafted for circulation to the aforementioned recruitment sources in Member States.
<P>
a "Leadership Skills for Women" course has been developed, two course sessions being held during the first half of 1995; an "Interviewing Skills for Managers" course which includes training in non-gender-biased interviewing techniques has been developed, three course sessions being held in the last quarter of 1994 and first half of 1995; an "Interviewing Skills for Applicants" course for in-house candidates wishing to apply for open positions has been developed, three course sessions being held in the last quarter of 1994 and first half of 1995 (almost 80% of the participants were women); and an "Effective Supervision Skills" course for supervisory staff in the GS category has been developed, two course sessions being held in the first half of 1995 (again almost 80% of the participants were women);<B>(2)</B> and
<P>
a Career Development and Learning Centre is being established to assist staff, and especially women, in assessing their potential and career options and to provide career choice guidance, and the Division of Personnel is regularly organizing workshops and briefings designed - <I>inter alia,</I> to increase staff members' awareness and understanding of career development principles.
<P>
8. In the statistical part of this document, the reference date is in most cases 1 August 1995. Information relating to the situation on two other reference dates (1 September 1989 and 1 August 1994) is also given in order that trends may be assessed. Although the main focus is on the representation of women in the Professional and higher categories, some of the data - as noted below - relate to female staff members in the GS category.
</UL>
<P>
(a) Staffing situation and recruitment principles
<P>
9. The total number of regular posts (both subject and not subject to geographical distribution) in the Professional and higher categories held by staff members appointed for a period of at least one year by the Director General following standard recruitment procedures (i.e. the circulation of a vacancy notice, competitive selection and government sponsorship) was 768 on 1 August 1995.
<P>
10.   Of these 768 posts, 86 were vacant on 1 August 1995, so that the number of staff members in the Professional and higher categories on board as of 1 August 1995 was 682.  The number of staff members in the GS category on board as of 1 August 1995 was 1390.
<P>
(b) Progress in improving the representation of women
<P>
11. As can be seen from Annex I, the percentage representation of women in the Professional and higher categories increased during the period 2 September 1989-1 August 1995 from 12.6% to 17.2% - an increase of more than 35% in six years. This improvement in the representation of women was achieved during a period of stability in the size of the Agency's staff, the number of staff members (both subject and not subject to geographical distribution) increasing by only six between 1989 and 1995; it was due entirely to the replacement of staff members who left the Agency.  Moreover, seven female candidates selected for appointment as of 1 August 1995 are not yet on board; should they join the Agency on the agreed dates of entry on duty, the percentage representation of women at the end of September 1995 will be 17.7% - an increase of almost 1% (instead of the 0.4% shown in Annex I) over the level reached on 1 August 1994.  During the period 2 September 1989-1 August 1995, the number of women at the levels P-5 and above increased from six to 16 - an increase in the representation of women at these levels from 3.2% to 8.0%. In the GS category, the percentage representation of women as of 1 August 1995 was 62.1%.
<P>
12. The percentage representation of developing Member States among the Agency's female staff members is 35% (Annex III).
<P>
13.   During the period August 1994-August 1995, 74 persons separated from and 72 were appointed to regular posts - a net decrease of two. Of those who separated from such posts, 16 - or 21.6% - were women. Of the appointees, 18 - or 25% - were women.
<P>
14. As can be seen from Annex III, the percentage representation of women is far lower in scientific and technical areas (7.8%) than in administrative areas (30.4%). In particular, the percentage representation of women is very low among Nuclear Engineers (4.3%), Nuclear Safeguards Inspectors (5.7%) and Nuclear Physicists and Physicists (13.8%), who account for more than 45% of the Agency's Professional staff.
<P>
15.   Of the 2368 outside applications received during the period August 1994-August 1995 for 35 vacant administrative posts in the Professional and higher categories (Annex IV), 465 - 19.6% - were from women. Of these female applicants, 6.7% were assessed as well- qualified; the percentage for male applicants was 3.9%.  Well-qualified female applicants accounted for 29.2% of the total number of well-qualified applicants, while 54.2% of the administrative posts for which selections were made went to female applicants, reflecting the affirmative action of the Secretariat in giving preference to women in cases of comparable qualifications and suitability.
<P>
16.   Of the 1074 outside applications received during the period August 1994-August 1995 for 45 vacant engineering and scientific posts in the Professional and higher categories (Annex IV), 80 - 7.4% - were from women. Of these female applicants, 10% were assessed as well- qualified; the percentage for male applicants was 11.7%.  Well-qualified female applicants accounted for 6.5% of the total number of well-qualified applicants, while 19.5% of the engineering and scientific posts for which selections were made went to female applicants, again reflecting the affirmative action of the Secretariat in giving preference to women in cases of comparable qualifications and suitability. For the three occupational groups in question (Nuclear Engineers, Nuclear Physicists and Physicists, and Nuclear Safeguards Inspectors), applications from women accounted for only 6.1% of the total applications received and women accounted for only 6.6% of the well-qualified applicants. These low percentages reflect the continuing scarcity of well-qualified women in the nuclear field.
<P>
Conclusion
<P>
17. The measures taken pursuant to resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/l 3 have been instrumental in improving the representation of women in the Secretariat despite a scarcity of women in the nuclear field. The Secretariat, which will continue to take such measures, urges Member States - and particularly the developing countries among them - to nominate more well-qualified female candidates in order that further progress may be achieved.

<B>(1)</B> The percentage of missions performed by female experts in 1994 was 6.8 % - compared with 7.1 % in 1993, 6.5% in 1992 and 2.2 % in 1981. There was an increase in the percentage of fellowships awarded to women from 21.9% in 1993 to 23.3% in 1994.  During the same period, the percentage of training course participants who were women rose from 22.8 % to 24.4 % and the percentage of visiting scientists who were women rose from 18.6% to 20.4%.
<P>
<B>(2)</B>The number of women who received training in the last quarter of 1994 and first half of 1995 was significantly higher than in the corresponding 1993-94 period.

<LI>The Agency safeguards system has, as its cornerstone, nuclear material accountancy. Since its inception over 30 years ago, the system has evolved and been strengthened by the regular introduction of new developments and improvements in both its effectiveness and efficiency for detecting diversion of nuclear material placed under safeguards. The discoveries in Iraq, the problems which have arisen in the Agency's efforts to verify the declared nuclear inventory in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Agency's positive experience in verifying the declared nuclear inventory in South Africa and the increasing importance of assurance regarding the absence of any undeclared nuclear activities and installations in States with comprehensive safeguards agreements have made it imperative to update the safeguards system by integrating into it measures that will give the Agency an improved capability of detecting clandestine nuclear activities if such exist.
<P>
<LI>This led, beginning in 1992, to a number of decisions by the Board of Governors re-affirming the requirements that Agency safeguards provide assurance regarding both the correctness and the completeness of nuclear material declarations by States with comprehensive safeguards agreements, endorsing some individual measures for increasing the Agency's capabilities in respect of verifying the completeness of States' declarations and requesting the Director General to submit to it concrete proposals for the assessment, development and testing of measures for strengthening safeguards and improving its cost effectiveness. In response to this request the Secretariat presented in December 1993 a programme, "Programme 93+2," which aimed, within 2 years, to evaluate the technical, financial and legal aspects of a comprehensive set of measures, including those recommendedby the Standing Advisory Group on Safeguards Implementation (SAGSI), and to present, early in 1995, proposals for a strengthened and more efficient safeguards system.
<P>
<li>"Programme 93 +2" has called for a major effort by the Secretariat. The work done could only have been accomplished with the extensive support of a large number of Member States. States have availed themselves of numerous opportunities, including the General Conferences, to provide the Secretariat with their views on the programme. Progress on the programme was previously reported to the 1994 General Conference in document GC(XXXVIII)/ 17.
<P>
<LI>In resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/10 the General Conference last year requested the Director General to:
<P>
"continue with the assessment and development and, on a voluntary basis, testing of the measures being considered under "Programme 93+2" in order that a more effective and cost-efficient system may be achieved, covering all nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the territory of a State with a comprehensive safeguards agreement,
<P>
"present to the Board of Governors in March 1995 proposals for a strengthened and more cost-efficient safeguards system, together with an evaluation of their technical, legal and financial implications, and inform the General Conference at its thirty-ninth regular session of the action taken."
<P>
<LI>This report provides information, concerning "Programme 93+2," on the Secretariat' s activities and the Board of Governors' consideration and decisions since the thirty-eighth regular session of the General Conference and on on-going work to implement measures under existing legal authority and to prepare proposals for the Board of Governors in December of this year for further strengthening measures to be implemented under complementary legal authority.
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Activities Since the Thirty-Eighth General Conference</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The fourth progress report on "Programme 93+2" (GOV/INF/75) was presented to the Board of Governors at its December 1994 session. It reviewed in a comprehensive manner the work that had been done under each of the seven tasks comprising the programme and discussed the various measures being examined under the programme. While no action on "Programme 93+2" was recommended to the December Board, the discussion which took place provided further guidance to the Secretariat for its work under the programme and for its preparation of proposals for the March 1995 Board of Governors. In his summing up at the December session, the Chairman noted, inter alia, that the Board had reiterated its support for "Programme 93+2" as an exercise leading to a strengthened and cost-effective safeguards system and that many Governors had indicated a need for Member States to be involved in the continuing evaluation of the financial and legal implications of any proposals.
<P>
<LI>The report to the March 1995 Board, document GOV/2784, is found in <A HREF=#annex1>Annex 1</A>. This report gave an overview of the proposed measures for strengthening the present safeguards system in a systematic and integrated manner; discussed how the various measuresinterrelate and how their synergistic effect would increase the level of assurance that could be attained; described each measure in detail in terms of its cost, effort, assurance and legal aspects, i.e., whether a legal basis already exists for the Secretariat to implement the measure or whether complementary authority is needed; and presented recommended Board action.
<P>
<LI>The Director General introduced this report in his statement to the March session of the Board, the relevant part of which is reproduced as <A HREF=#annex2>Annex 2</A>. He stated that the measures presented in the report would provide significant improvements in the safeguards system, characterizing them as providing greater access to information and greater access to sites by inspectors. He urged Board approval of the recommendations in the report which would not imply endorsement of the specific measures described in the report but would allow the Secretariat to proceed with the preparation of specific proposals for the Board's consideration and approval in June.
<P>
<LI>There was an extensive discussion of document GOV/2784 in the Board during the March session. Although some Governors expressed reservations (at this stage) about certain aspects of some of the recommended measures, the Board endorsed the general direction of "Programme 93 + 2". It also requested the Secretariat to submit for consideration at its June session, specific proposals for a strengthened and cost-effective safeguards system, taking into account the comments made during the discussion and any other comments which may still be received from Member States.
<P>
<LI>Full details of discussions in the Board including its decision on the matter are contained in <A HREF=#annex3>Annex 3</A>.
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat submitted for the Board's consideration at its June session document GOV/2807 (Annex 4) which contained a comprehensive set of strengthening and efficiency measures arranged in two parts. Part 1 consists of those measures which could, in the Secretariat's view, be implemented under existing legal authority and which would be practical and useful to implement routinely at an early date. Part 2 consists of those measures which the Secretariat proposes for implementation on the basis of complementary authority to be granted. The pragmatic step of partitioning the measures into two parts was taken to speed the implementation process. The Secretariat continues to emphasize the importance of the full set of measures in both parts as an integrated package.
<P>
<LI>The Director General, in his introductory statement to the June session of the Board relating to document GOV/2807 <A HREF=#annex5>(Annex 5)</A>, mentioned that the work of the Agency to strengthen further the effectiveness of safeguards was strongly endorsed by the NPT Review and Extension Conference. He referred to the many helpful comments received from Member States on "Programme 93 +2" and to the advice of SAGSI on the programme, which had contributed to the preparation of document GOV/2807. He stated that, rather than submitting the proposals in Part 2 of the document to the September Board, it would be more appropriate for the Secretariat to have the benefit of discussions at this year's regular session of the General Conference and of further informal consultations with Member States before submitting the proposals, together with a draft legal instrument, for the Board's considerationin December.
<P>
<LI>The Board's discussion of document GOV/2807 was equally extensive and lasted a full day. The Official Records, including the Board's decision are found in Annex 6. These include the extensive comments and suggestions made during the discussion, which the Chairman stated, in his summing up, should be taken into account in the next phase of the work. The Board took the action recommended in paragraph 6 of document GOV/2807, namely that "the Board take note of the Director General's plan to implement at an early date the measures described in Part 1 and that it urge States party to comprehensive safeguards agreements to co-operate with the Secretariat to facilitate such implementation," on the understanding that elaboration of the implementing arrangements and the clarification of concerns will require consultations between the Secretariat and individual Member States.
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>On-Going Work</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>Following the June Board, the Secretariat began the task of formalizing implementation of the Part 1 measures on a routine and universal basis under comprehensive safeguards agreements. A Policy Group, consisting of all Directors of the Department of Safeguards and chaired by the Deputy Director General for Safeguards, was established to set objectives and milestones, provide overall guidance and review, monitor and approve the measures to be carried out. A Working Group, including of the Heads of the Operations Procedures Sections and chaired by the Director of the Division of Safeguards Concepts and Planning, was established to ensure that the guidelines, procedures and documents needed for implementation of the measures are produced by appropriate Agency personnel. The responsibilities of these two groups will begin with the Part 1 measures and continue with Part 2 measures when approved for implementation by the Board.
<P>
<LI>The work of these groups is well underway. The plan for implementation of the Part 1 measures is being developed, and a programme for consultations with Member States will begin in September to elaborate the implementing arrangements and clarify concerns.
<P>
<LI>Development of the Part 2 proposals and of a draft legal instrument for granting the complementary authority for their implementation is nearing completion within the Secretariat. During September, consultations with Member States will intensify to facilitate completion of the documents for the December 1995 session of the Board to facilitate the Board's consideration of these documents.

<HR>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>In resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/16 of 23 September 1994, the General Conference, inter alia, decided:<BR>
"to include in the agenda for its thirty-ninth regular session an item entitled "Implementation of the agreement between the Agency and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the Application of Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons".  This report is designed to provide information to the General Conference in its consideration of this item of its agenda.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>The Situation Prevailing with Regards to Safeguards Implementation in the DPRK at the time of the Thirty-Eighth Regular Session of the General Conference</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The Director General's report to the General Conference in 1994 in document GC(XXXVIII)/l9 recalled the overall developments which had taken place in safeguards implementation in the DPRK pursuant to the DPRK's Safeguards Agreement with the Agency (INFCIRC/403), both with regard to inconsistencies between the DPRK's initial report on its nuclear material subject to safeguards and the Secretariat's findings and to the DPRK's declared nuclear activities. The report focused in particular on developments throughout the course of 1994 up until the time of the General Conference.  These included problems over inspection activities at declared nuclear facilities in the DPRK despite the DPRK's acceptance, on 15 February 1994, of a detailed list of such activities for providing continuity of safeguards knowledge and later, the discharge of fuel from the DPRK's 5 MWe Experimental Nuclear Power Plant, without the safeguards measures requested by the Agency and in a way which seriously eroded the Agency's ability to take further measures crucial to its ability to ascertain whether all the plutonium produced in the DPRK had been declared to the Agency. These developments also included the continuous inspector presence in the Nyongbyon area beginning in May. The report also covered developments following the DPRK's withdrawal from the Agency membership with effect from 13 June 1994, notably, the DPRK's initially declared unwillingness to accept further Agency inspection activities and the later modification of its position in this regard. The Director General's report to the General Conference in 1994 concluded with an account of some positive developments which had taken place early in September 1994, namely, oral and practical indication that the DPRK was ready to enlarge the scope of inspections, as requested by the Agency, at declared
         nuclear facilities in the DPRK. The report also recalled that, at the meetings of the Board of Governors which had taken place on 12 September 1994, the Director General and the Secretariat were commended on their efforts to discharge their safeguards responsibilities in the DPRK and were requested to continue with those efforts.

Developments Over Safeguards Implementation in the DPRK Since the Thirty-Eight Regular Session of the General Conference</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI> Following progress made during bilateral consultations between DPRK and United States representatives, the DPRK accepted enlarging the scope of inspections in early September 1994. The Agency inspectors were given access to the Nuclear Fuel Rod Fabrication Plant and the Nuclear Fuel Rod Storage facility for periodic inspections, as required by the Agency. The inspectors were also enabled, in addition to the other activities being carried out at the 5 MWe Reactor, to enter the reactor fuel storage to verify the fresh fuel rod inventory. However, at the Radiochemical Laboratory, the DPRK continued to refuse to allow the Agency inspectors to ascertain the state of completion of the new process line under construction there and declined examination of records and gamma-mapping activities.
<P>
<LI> Further, bilateral talks between the DPRK and the United States in the autumn of 1994 culminated in an 'Agreed Framework', (reproduced in INFCIRC/457) signed in Geneva on 21 October 1994. This envisages specific functions for the Agency, notably to monitor a "freeze on the DPRK's graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities", to continue with verification activities at facilities not covered by the freeze and to take measures required with a view to verifying, at a later date, the accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's initial report on all nuclear material in the DPRK. The Director General briefed Members of the Agency informally on 25 October 1994 about the potential implications for the Agency of the Agreed Framework, inter alia emphasising that such a bilateral instrument could not replace, supersede or detract from the Safeguards Agreement between the IAEA and the DPRK. The Director General similarly briefed Members of the Security Council on 28 October 1994 . The Security Council considered the Agreed Framework and on 4 November, the President of the Security Council issued a Statement (S/PRST/1994/64). Extracts from the Statement of direct relevance to the Agency are attached at <A HREF=#annex1>Annex I</A>. Key points are that through the Statement, the Security Council, inter alia:
<P>
Took note of the decision of the DPRK in the "Agreed Framework" to remain a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to come into full compliance with the IAEA-DPRK Safeguards Agreement (INFCIRC/403) under the Treaty; underlined that the Safeguards Agreement remains binding and in force and looked to the DPRK to act thereon; noted with approval the DPRK's decision in the Agreed Framework to freeze its graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities; noted that IAEA monitoring activities with respect to such a voluntary measure are within the scope of verification activities under the IAEA-DRPK Safeguards Agreement; requested the IAEA to take all steps it may deem necessary as a consequence of the Agreed Framework to monitor the freeze and; requested the IAEA to continue to report to it on the implementation of the Safeguards Agreement until the DPRK has come into full compliance with the Agreement and to report to the Council on its activities related to monitoring the freeze of the specified facilities.
<P>
<LI>At a special meeting of the Board of Governors convened for 11 November 1994, the Director General, in his written report (GOV/2687/Add.9 of 8 November 1994) and in his oral Statement, described the Agency's understanding of the freeze to which the Agreed Framework and the Statement by the President of the Security Council had referred i.e. that there will be no operations at the facilities covered by the freeze and no construction work of any kind, either at existing facilities or new, related facilities; that the spent fuel from the 5 MWe reactor will be stored and disposed of in a manner that does not involve reprocessing in the DPRK; and that any movements of nuclear material or equipment within those facilities, any necessary maintenance work by the operator and any transfers of nuclear material out of the facilities would have to be carried out under the observation of Agency inspectors or under other Agency arrangements. The Director General also recalled that monitoring of a freeze, as requested by the Security Council and as understood above can be performed by the Agency in the course of implementing safeguards in the DPRK; the activities required are part of activities which the Agency may perform while implementing safeguards agreements. The main additional element in the DPRK case would be the specific reporting to the Security Council on the monitoring of the freeze.
<P>
<LI>The Director General's written report in GOV/2687/Add.9 to the November 1994 Board meeting inter alia listed the declared nuclear facilities in the DPRK to be covered by the freeze (<A HREF=#annex2>Annex II</A> to this report), explained that other facilities and installations included in the DPRK's declarations but which are not covered by the freeze will also be subject to safeguards, said that the Agency's current assessment of the resources required for safeguards implementation in the DPRK, including monitoring the freeze, would not much exceed the resources now being spent and highlighted the practical meaning of the Agency verifying "full DPRK compliance with the IAEA-DPRK Safeguards Agreement" to which the Statement of 4 November 1994 by the President of the Security Council had referred.
<P>
<LI>The Director General explained that "full compliance" clearly encompasses the verification of the accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's Initial Report on the inventory of nuclear material subject to safeguards and requires the DPRK to take all the steps in this regard that the Agency may deem necessary to preserve, intact, all information relevant to such verification, following technical discussions between the IAEA and DPRK. The commitment by the DPRK in the Agreed Framework foresees a delay before the Agency is enabled to verify the accuracy and completeness of the initial report and to verify full DPRK compliance with the IAEA/DPRK Safeguards Agreement. However, the Director General has stressed both to Members of the Agency and to the Security Council, that it would be better for all concerned if co-operation in this respect from the DPRK were to come promptly, as required by the Safeguards Agreement. The Agency's ability to verify full compliance with the IAEA/DPRK Safeguards Agreement will depend substantially on the extent to which all relevant information will remain available.
<P>
<LI>At its meeting on 11 November 1994, the Board of Governors, inter alia took note of the Agreed Framework and of the DPRK's decision therein to remain a party to the NPT and to come into full compliance with the IAEA/DPRK safeguards agreement. The Board also reaffirmed that the safeguards agreement remained binding and in force; authorized the Director General to carry out all the tasks requested of the Agency as outlined in the Presidential Statement of the United Nations Security Council on 4 November 1994; and requested the Director General to report to it periodically and to the Security Council as appropriate on the implementation of the IAEA/DPRK safeguards agreement and on Agency activities related to monitoring the freeze on specified facilities in the DPRK. Subsequently, a technical team from the Department of Safeguards, visited the DPRK from 23-28 November 1994 to discuss the verification measures which the IAEA has to perform at nuclear facilities in the DPRK whether or not those facilities are covered by the freeze.  During this visit, the IAEA technical team visited all the nuclear facilities subject to the freeze in Nyongbyon and the reactor under construction in Taechon and confirmed that they were not in operation and that construction work had stopped.  In his statement to the Board on 8 December 1994, the Director General recalled that these technical discussions between Agency and DPRK representatives had been useful and constructive and that implementation of some of the measures required was already under way. He also said that arrangements had been made to enable the Agency to meet most of its objectives, although a few remaining areas required further technical consideration and discussion with DPRK representatives.
<P>
<LI>To take all these matters forward, the Agency technical team again visited the DPRK in January of this year. Discussions with DPRK representatives focused on the implementation of the verification measures already agreed and technical issues which had been left open since November 1994. In the former context, the DPRK accepted some verification activities, such as containment and surveillance measures, which the Agency needs to carry out to verify the freeze, but declined other measures, relevant to the monitoring of the freeze, such as the taking of measurements of liquid wastes at the Radiochemical Laboratory to verify that there is no movement or any operation involving there wastes and measurements for assessing the total amount of plutonium in spent fuel rods from the DPRK's 5 MWe Experimental Nuclear Power Plant. The spent fuel measurements should be taken during the transfer of the spent fuel into containers for storage. These measurements would also verify whether all the rods in the spent fuel storage are indeed spent fuel rods. The DPRK regards such issues as matters to be addressed later, when the DPRK comes into full compliance with its safeguards agreement.  In that respect, a difference continues between the Agency and the DPRK as to the current status of the safeguards agreement. The DPRK regards acceptance of measures required to enable the Agency to monitor the freeze as not being under the safeguards agreement but as falling solely within the context of the 'Agreed Framework'. DPRK has further indicated that, until such time as it comes into full compliance with its safeguards agreement, the Agency can carry out ad hoc and routine inspections only at facilities not covered by the freeze.
<P>
<LI>Notwithstanding the continuing difference of view between the Agency and the DPRK as to the current status of the Safeguards Agreement, the Director General was able to report in his statement to the Board in March 1995 that verification measures in the DPRK were proceeding at facilities covered by the freeze in the way envisaged by the Agency with the exception of the taking of certain measurements. The taking of these measurements was an important issue for further discussion, expected to take place in the Spring. Safeguards implementation had also been facilitated for the Agency through the DPRK's acceptance of 10 additional inspector designations and continuous presence of Agency inspectors at Nyongbyon. The Director General also observed that another important issue, the steps which the DPRK needed to take to meet its undertaking to preserve, intact, all information relevant to the verification of the accuracy and completeness of its initial declaration, had yet to be discussed between Agency and DPRK representatives.
<P>
<LI>At the conclusion of its consideration of the DPRK item on its agenda in March 1995, the Board, having taken note of the Director General's remarks, welcomed the fact that further technical discussions between Agency and DPRK representatives had been scheduled for the Spring and hoped that further agreement would be reached on the issues outstanding.
<P>
<LI>Unfortunately, the technical discussions scheduled for the Spring did not take place.  On 11 April 1995 the Agency invited a DPRK team to Vienna to continue technical discussions. In response, the DPRK informed the Agency, on 20 April 1995, that the Agency technical team should visit Pyongyang early in May. On 2 May, however, the DPRK informed the Agency that the DPRK continues to regard the activities of the IAEA in their country as directly related to the implementation of the "Agreed Framework". In the DPRK's view therefore, at a time when negotiations between the US and DPRK over aspects of that bilateral agreement related to the light water reactor issue, were at stalemate, there was little point in holding further technical discussions with the Agency. The DPRK was nevertheless aware that the Agency was ready to resume technical discussions at any time.
<P>
<LI>The Director General reported this in his statement to the June 1995 meetings of the Board of Governors; and informed the Board about the inspections which had taken place, since the March 1995 Board meeting, at three of the DPRK's declared nuclear facilities not covered by the freeze. As for facilities covered by the freeze the Director General reported that DPRK had conducted maintenance work at the 5 MWe Experimental Power Plant, and had indicated that they planned to carry out such work also at the Radiochemical Laboratory.  The Director General concluded his statement to the Board by saying that such maintenance work as had so far been carried out had taken place in the presence of IAEA inspectors.
<P>
<LI>At the conclusion of its consideration of the DPRK the Board took note of the information provided by the Director General, said it would like to see further technical talks between the Agency and the DPRK taking place soon and wished to see agreement reached on the issues outstanding.
<P>
<LI>Since then the Agency has maintained its continuous inspection presence in the Nyongbyon area. After the conclusion of the recent round of bilateral US/DPRK discussions on the light water reactor issue, the DPRK indicated its readiness to continue discussions with the IAEA technical team. The technical discussions are planned during the week starting 11 September 1995 in DPRK. The topics suggested by the IAEA for discussion during the forthcoming meeting include all the outstanding issues of measurements and other implementation matters as well as the Agency's requirements with regard to the information deemed necessary by the Agency to be preserved intact by DPRK, so as to permit in the future the verification of the accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's initial declaration.

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
</STRONG>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The Director General, in his statement to the thirty-eighth regular session of the General Conference, noted that the international community had been alarmed by cases in 1994 of illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and that the Secretariat had over the previous year received reports of many such incidents. He said he had consulted many Member States exposed to trafficking to identify ways in which the Agency might help mitigate the problem.  The Director General indicated his readiness to convene a Round Table of government experts to recommend specific actions which could be taken by the Agency.
<P>
<LI>On the initiative of several Member States, the General Conference adopted a resolution on "Measures against Illicit Trafficking in Nuclear Material" (GC(XXXVIII)/RES/15, September 1994). In confirming that national governments and authorities carry the main responsibility in this field, the resolution called upon IAEA Member States to "take all necessary measures to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear material". At the same time, it stressed the importance of close co-operation between states, both bilaterally and multilaterally, for overcoming the problems involved in this matter. The resolution invited the Director General to intensify Agency activities that were already supporting Member States in this area, such as those related to the establishment and upgrading of national systems of nuclear material accounting and control; to examine additional options available in the field of collecting, verifying, and analyzing data relating to incidents of illicit trafficking and the field of physical protection, in conformity with the Agency's Statute; and to prepare proposals, in consultation with a group of experts designated by Member States and competent international organizations, for submission to the IAEA Board of Governors.
<P>
<LI>In response to the requests contained in the resolution, a meeting of governmental experts, attended by 96 participants from 46 States and from three international organizations, was held from 2-3 November 1994 at IAEA Headquarters in Vienna. The discussion focused primarily on the areas in which the Agency is already active and those where it could intensify and expand its activities. While expressing the view that the primary responsibility for preventing and responding to illicit trafficking rests with the governments concerned, the experts urged that practical and effective complementary measures be taken at the international level - particularly by and through the IAEA - to address the problem of illicit trafficking.
<P>
<LI>Taking account of the views advanced by the governmental experts and discussions held with Missions, the Secretariat submitted a report in document GOV/2773 to the December 1994 session of the Board of Governors (Annex 1). It includes proposals for the intensification of the current Agency activities and for new activities in support of Member States' efforts against illicit trafficking. The proposals addressed legal instruments, physical protection of nuclear material, state systems of accounting and control, security of other radioactive sources, analysis of confiscated materials and a data base for illicit trafficking  incidents.
<P>
<LI>After extensive discussion of document GOV/2773, the Board of Governors requested the Secretariat to continue developing the proposed actions through additional discussion and consultation with Member States, and decided to consider the matter further at the March 1995 session.
<P>
<LI>In response to this request, the Secretariat identified activities which could be carried out during 1995 and 1996 in support of Member States' efforts to prevent and respond to illicit trafficking. These were presented to the March 1995 session of the Board of Governors as a progress report on the Secretariat's continuing development of a programme in document GOV/2773/Add. 1 (Annex 2). Specific activities for 1995 and 1996 were proposed in the areas of: physical protection; state systems of accounting and control; radiation safety infrastructure related to security of radioactive sources; and, an IAEA data base covering illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and other radioactive sources.
<P>
<LI>The Board at its March 1995 session requested the Director General to carry out the proposed activities on the understanding that, when implementing the measures in question, the Secretariat would take into account the comments made in the Board and would conduct further consultations with Member States, as appropriate.
<P>
<LI>On 11 July 1995, the UN Secretary-General sent a letter to the President of the Security Council noting his close contact with the Director General on the matter of illicit trafficking and suggesting that the Security Council may want to express its own concerns about the problem and its appreciation of the Agency's efforts.  In response, the President of the Security Council, on 19 July, issued a statement which, inter alia, stated that "The members of the Council extend full support to the International Atomic Energy Agency and other international bodies for the work they are undertaking in this field".
<P>
<STRONG>
II. STATUS OF SECRETARIAT ACTIONS
</STRONG>
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat is focussing its actions related to measures against illicit trafficking in 1995-96 on four main areas
<P>
An IAEA data base on incidents of illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources;
<P>
Physical protection of nuclear material;
<P>
State Systems of Accounting and Control for nuclear material; and 
<P> 
Radiation safety infrastructure related to control and security of other radioactive sources
<P>
The Deputy Director General for Safeguards is the co-ordinator of the overall programme. The status of each of these areas is described below in paragraphs 11-20.
<P>
<LI>The Agency is funding some of these activities under its regular programme and budget. However, intensification of the programme and new activities require additional resources. The resources needed to carry out the proposed activities in 1995 and 1996 have been estimated at approximately US$1.3 million and US$1.7 million, respectively. Extra-budgetary resources have been made available that will cover the costs foreseen in 1995. For 1996, under Programme S.7, 'Enhanced Security of Nuclear Materials and Other Radioactive Sources', the costs will be covered both by regular budget and extra-budgetary resources, most of which have already been pledged. Thereafter, the programme will continue to the extent permitted by availability of regular budget and extra-budgetary resources.
<P>
<STRONG>
III. DATA BASE ON ILLICIT TRAFFICKING IN NUCLEAR MATERIAL AND OTHER RADIOACTIVE SOURCES
</STRONG>
<P>
<LI>The Agency has informed Member States that it has upgraded its Data Base System on Illicit Trafficking and is prepared to accept information on illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources and will begin issuing periodic summary reports. The Secretariat also invited Governments to indicate their interest in participating in this programme and identify their Point of Contact for the data base. The Secretariat has entered into this data base information it had previously collected from open sources since 1993: 39 incidents in 1993; 25 incidents in 1994; and 6 incidents in the first half of 1995.
<P>
<LI>As part of the development of this enhanced data base, the Agency convened a meeting of representatives from 16 countries from 17-18 May 1995, to consider the provision of information from Governments and Agency reports to Governments. Useful suggestions were obtained and these are being reflected in the new IAEA data base noted above.
<P>
<STRONG>
IV. PHYSICAL PROTECTION OF NUCLEAR MATERIAL
</STRONG>
<P>
<LI>In addition to the International Training Course, which has been given under the Agency's TC programme by the Sandia National Laboratory, USA, for the past 15 years, a Regional Training Course on Physical Protection of Nuclear Facilities and Materials for individuals from the Russian Federation, Newly Independent States and Member States in Eastern Europe has been organized by the Agency. This will be the first time that this course will be given in Europe and the first with simultaneous interpretation and instructional material in English and Russian. The course will be held from 13-24 November 1995 at the Dukovany Nuclear Training Center in Brno, Czech Republic. The Secretariat is currently working out the final details of the course arrangements with the Czech Republic and the U.S. Government. Selection of the 30 participants will be made at the end of September.
<P>
<LI>In the coming months, the Secretariat will: assess the need for additional physical protection training; draft a basic reference manual on physical protection principles and practices; and, prepare for an International Conference on Physical Protection that has been included in the Agency's programme for 1997.
<P>
<LI>A consultants' meeting will also be held before the end of the year to obtain guidance on the scope and objectives of an Agency service to provide, only upon request, an international team of experts to review national regulatory programmes for the physical protection of nuclear materials or the implementation of physical protection systems at specific nuclear facilities.
<P>
<LI>Further objectives of the Agency's programme in this area are to provide fellowship assignments to individuals to receive "on-the-job" training in physical protection activities, and to procure selected pieces of equipment needed for specific facilities (which are currently not being provided by existing donor programmes).  
<P> 
<STRONG>
V. STATE SYSTEMS OF ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL OF NUCLEAR MATERIAL
</STRONG>
<P>
<LI>The Agency is continuing to facilitate co-ordination of the development and implementation of "Co-ordinated Technical Support Plans" in the Newly Independent States, for which funding is provided by Donor States. In June 1995 the Agency convened a Donor's meeting in Vienna with the objective of identifying additional assistance needed by Recipient States and new potential Donor States which may be interested in addressing these needs. Arrangements to enhance communication between all parties concerned were reviewed. In addition, an Implementation/Co-ordination Committee meeting was held in Belarus and a physical protection site survey was conducted in Uzbekistan.
<P>
<LI>The Agency is increasing its activities in providing training for State Systems of Accounting and Control (SSACs) and will administer in 1995 a regional course and two courses in individual States in addition to the traditional international course.
<P>
<STRONG>
VI. RADIATION SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED TO CONTROL AND SECURITY OF OTHER RADIOACTIVE SOURCES</STRONG>
<P>
<LI>In June 1995, the Agency convened a technical committee meeting in Vienna on the safe transport of radioactive materials. This meeting was attended by representatives from 20 Member States, Europol and the World Customs Organization. A major consideration by this committee was the illicit trafficking of radioactive materials through countries and, particularly at borders which the committee members identified as a high priority concern that needed immediate attention. They encouraged the Agency to provide additional guidance to its Member States for detecting and handling radioactive materials in such situations. In addition, they strongly supported the Agency's role in fostering inter-agency co-operation on illicit trafficking, particularly to meet the specific needs of customs services and security authorities.
<P>
<LI>To consider how international agencies can address the concerns of national authorities and customs officials, the Secretariat is hosting an Interagency Co-ordination Meeting on the cross-border movement of radioactive materials, including nuclear materials, in September 1995. The organizations invited are the United Nations, Interpol, World Customs Organization, Europol, EURATOM, the International Maritime Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization. The meeting will seek to assess how support to States for combating the illicit movement of these materials can be made more effective through better co-ordination among the competent international organisations.
<P>
<LI>In August the Agency conducted a training course in Tehran for a number of States in that region to address methods for improving the regulatory infrastructure of these countries. There was emphasis on the control of radioactive materials and measures to combat the illicit movement of these materials. In addition, the Agency is organizing an international training seminar for November 1995 in Vienna on the administrative control, inspection and security of radioactive materials.

<OL>
<LI>In resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/21, the General Conference last year, inter alia,called upon all parties directly concerned:
<P>
"to consider seriously taking the practical and appropriate steps required for the implementation of the proposal to establish a mutually and effectively verifiable nuclear-weapon-free-zone (NWFZ) in the region", and in this regard, requested the Director General:
<P>
"to continue consultations with the States of the Middle East to facilitate the early activities in the region as relevant to the preparation of model agreements, as a necessary step towards the establishment of a NWFZ in the region ..".
<P>
<LI>The resolution further took note:
<P>
"of the importance of the ongoing bilateral Middle East peace negotiations and the activities of the multilateral working group on Arms Control and Regional Security in promoting mutual confidence and security in the Middle East, including establishment of a NWFZ", and called upon the Director General, as requested by the participants:
<P>
"to render all necessary assistance to the working group in promoting that objective".

<LI>The resolution further called upon all States in the region to extend their fullest co-operation to the Director General in the fulfilment of the tasks entrusted to him and requested the Director General "to submit to the Board of Governors and to the General Conference at its thirty-ninth regular session a report on the implementation of this resolution . . . ".
<P>
<LI>It may be recalled that the Director General submitted to the General Conference in 1992 a report contained in document GC(XXXVI)/1019 of 16 September 1992 which described the kinds of obligations which might be undertaken, in a Middle East NWFZ agreement, by the States located in the region and by the declared nuclear-weapon States. Such obligations were characterised as falling within three broad categories:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>those precluding research and development on and the possession, acquisition, manufacture or stationing of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices;
<LI>those precluding research and development on and the production, importing or stockpiling of weapons-usable materials (i.e. uranium enriched to 20 per cent or more  in uranium 235 and separated plutonium) and requiring the disclosure of all nuclear activities, including research and development, imports, exports and production; and 
<LI>those requiring the application of safeguards to all nuclear material, installations and relevant equipment and non-nuclear material.
</UL>
<P>
The report further identified types of obligations described in the three broad categories which had already been entered into by States in the Middle East whether by reason of their membership in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), or because of other pertinent considerations.
<P>
<LI>As well as describing the kinds of material obligations which might form part of a Middle East NWFZ agreement, the Director General's report submitted in 1992 identified possible verification requirements in such a zone, noting that in view of the particular circumstances of the Middle East and its underlying tensions, creating confidence in a Middle East NWFZ would most likely require far-reaching and comprehensive verification arrangements. As noted indocument GC(XXXVI)/1019, institutional arrangements combining international and regional verification in a NWFZ, can be devised.
<P>
<LI>However, to enable the Director General to proceed further in examining verification modalities which might feature in a Middle East NWFZ, and in particular to develop the model agreements foreseen, inter alia, in resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/21, it would be helpful if States which have not yet responded to the Director General's request for views on the obligations, verification requirements and modalities described in document GC(XXXVI)/1019 were to provide them. In this regard and notwithstanding the call upon relevant States, in resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/21, to extend their fullest co-operation to the Director General, no further replies have been received to the Director General's letters of November 1992 seeking States' views about possible material obligations included in a Middle East NWFZ agreement or on verification requirements and modalities.
<P>
<LI>Paragraphs 8-13 of the Director General's report to the Board and the General Conference last year in document GOV/2757-GC(XXXVIII)/ 18 described Secretariat participation, as part of the United Nations delegation, in meetings of the multilateral working group on Arms Control and Regional Security (ACRS). The report recalled, inter alia, that at its fifth plenary meeting in Doha, the Secretariat had put forward a proposal for a practical activity to follow up the Agency workshop held in Vienna in May 1993 on "the Modalities for the Application of Safeguards in a Future Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in the Middle East". That proposal envisaged a visit, by regional participants in the multilateral working group's deliberations, to a nuclear power plant in Europe to see a practical demonstration of nuclear verification techniques and to become more fully acquainted with the ways in which regional verification structures and activities complement international verification in Europe.
<P>
<LI> Following the Doha meeting, the IAEA and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM), with the co-operation and assistance of the relevant German authorities, arranged a visit by regional participants to the Phillipsburg Nuclear Power Plant in Germany in October 1994. Participants were able to see a practical demonstration of nuclear verification techniques and to hear presentations from the IAEA and from Euratom. The visit appeared to be helpful in further acquainting Middle East participants with the practicalities of nuclear verification, including through cooperative arrangements with regional systems.
<P>
<LI>Also in fulfilment of the mandate conferred upon the Director General by resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/21, the Secretariat participated, again as part of the United Nations delegation, in the sixth plenary meeting of the ACRS working group held in Tunis from 13-15 December 1994. The Tunis meeting inter alia reviewed the work and recommendations of those intersessional meetings which had been held since May 1994 and also made progress on a number of important issues relevant to Arms Control and  Security.
<P>
<LI>In the same spirit, the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) convened from 26-27 May 1995 in Geneva, a workshop to examine the modalities of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East.  Regional experts were invited to participate in their personal capacities. At UNIDIR's invitation, the IAEA's Assistant Director General for External Relations gave a presentation on verification issues relevant to a future nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East.
<P>
<LI>The general concept of NWFZs and in particular of such a zone in the Middle East has continued to be a focus of discussion in other fora. Thus, a further resolution supporting the establishment of a Middle East NWFZ, resolution 49/71, was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly without a vote on 15 December 1994.  Additionally, the 'Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament' adopted by the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference reaffirmed the conviction of the States Party that the development of NWFZs, especially in regions of tension, such as in the Middle East, as well as the establishment of zones free of all weapons of mass destruction should be encouraged as a matter of priority, taking into account the specific characteristics of each region.
<p>
<LI>Towards such ends, resolution NPT/Conf.1995/32/RES/1, adopted by the NPT Review and Extension Conference on 11 May 1995, called upon States in the Middle East to take practical steps to facilitate progress towards the establishment of an effective verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.
<P>
LI>There is increasing attention being paid to the concept of NWFZs as valuable regional non-proliferation endeavours and in particular to the establishment of a Middle East NWFZ.  The Agency will continue its work, pursuant to the tasks entrusted to the Director General by the General Conference, of contributing to the development of verification modalities for such a zone. The report of the Director General in document GC(XXXVI)/1019 of 1992, inter alia, noted that there were many options and problems on which a consensus would be needed among the parties for the establishment of a Middle East NWFZ. It noted also that it is only through a process of discussion that the choices of options and the answers to problems, which in many instances will be decisive for the safeguards model agreements foreseen in General Conference resolutions, can emerge. With this in mind, and with a view further to encourage States of the Middle East to convey their views about relevant issues, the Director General intends to pursue his consultations with such States in Vienna and visits to the region in the winter of 1995/96.
<P>
LI>It is still to be hoped that through written response from relevant States, through consultation and through the Agency's continuing participation in the working group on ACRS, the views of relevant States, especially with regard to material obligations to be assumed in a Middle East NWFZ and to possible verification modalities, will be clarified to an extent to enable the Director General to prepare model verification agreements envisaged in resolutions GC(XXXVIII)/RES/21, GC(XXXVII)/RES/627 and GC(XXXVI)/RES/601.

AMENDMENT OF ARTICLE VI OF THE STATUTE
<P>                      
Report to the Board of Governors by the Chairperson of the Open-ended Consultative Group on Article VI of the Statute
</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<P>
1. On 23 September 1994, the General Conference of the IAEA adopted by consensus resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/14, which requested "the Board of Governors to continue consultations with Member States through an effective mechanism and to submit its recommendations on proposed amendments to Article VI for approval by the General Conference at its thirty-ninth regular session".
<P>
 2. The Board, at its meeting on 9 December 1994, decided to establish an "Open-ended Consultative Group" as the effective mechanism to deal with the request contained in resolution GCXXXVIII)/RES/14 and also appointed Ambassador Fuegen OK of Turkey as the Chairperson of the Group.
<P>
3. Following extensive informal bilateral consultations with various delegations, a first meeting of the Open-ended Consultative Group was held on 24 February 1995. The meeting, which was attended by representatives of 61 Member States, had before it the following:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>
(a) a proposal by a group of Member States for modification of Article VI of the IAEA Statute (otherwise referred to as the "Sherry Group" proposal)(Annex 1);
<P>
<DD>         
(b) a non-paper on the "criteria" for the designation of members to the Board of Governors.
</DL>
<P>
4. Reporting on her informal consultations, the Chairperson noted that the following issues were raised during her consultations:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>         
(i) whether the current eight regional groupings in the IAEA were satisfactory in view of the lack of any definitive mechanism for determining the composition of the various areas;
<P>
<DD>
(ii) how the size of the Board could conform to current nuclear capabilities of a number of Member States as well as the increase in number of Member States of the Agency; and
<P>
<DD>         
(iii) the request of the Board made at its meeting on 9 June 1994 that the Working Group on Article VI should give special attention to the application of rules regarding designation of Board members under Article VI.A. 1 and to submit its views in time for the consultations this year on the designations for 1995-96.
</DL>
<P>
5. The Chair noted that the Sherry Group proposal was the only formal proposal before the Group and consequently the meeting had a detailed and extensive discussion of the proposal.
<P>
6. There was however no agreement on the contents of the "Sherry Group" proposal. Those in favour of the proposal noted that regional groupings, as contained in the IAEA Statute, and criteria for their classification which were established 38 years ago were no longer valid. They also argued that the current size and composition of the Board do not correspond to the significant increase in the membership of the IAEA and therefore felt that both issues - regional groupings and size of the Board - need to be reviewed to correspond to current global realities. A larger number of Member States opposed to the "Sherry Group" proposal felt that the present size and composition of the Board was adequate and efficient and does not see the need for a change. They were also opposed to any change in the current regional group classification.  It was generally agreed, however, that the "Sherry Group" proposal was a good starting point for further in-depth deliberations for possible amendments, changes or modifications of Article VI.
<P>
7. After further informal consultations a second meeting was held on 3 May 1995 (with another planned for May 29, 1995). The meeting, which was attended by representatives of 48 Member States, had before it, the following documentation:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>         
(a) a listing of a set of ideas and suggestions (see Annex 2);
<P>
<DD>
(b) copy of a letter and attachment received by the Chair from the Philippine Governor relating to the criteria for Board designation (Annex 3).
</DL>
<P>
8. During the discussion of the question of criteria for Board designation, the Belgian representative drew the attention of the Consultative Group to a non-paper (which was subsequently circulated at the meeting) relating to "qualifications for designation to the Board of Governors of the IAEA" (Annex 4).
<P>
9. In addition to the question of criteria for designation, the meeting discussed other ideas/suggestions relating to possible amendments of Article VI. In this connection, the issue of regional classification in the context of the various suggestions was also elaborated upon.
<P>
10. The Chairperson indicated that the ideas/suggestions which were before the Group emerged from her informal bilateral consultations and are meant to serve as basis for further deliberations on the issue as no other formal proposals have yet been submitted, apart from that of the "Sherry Group". She therefore urged those delegations that raised the various ideas with her during the informal consultations to elaborate on them during the meeting. She also requested members to endeavour to clearly and unambiguously indicate their national or group positions on the various ideas/suggestions which were before the Group.
<P>
11. With regard to the issue of criteria for designation of members to the Board, the meeting expressed appreciation for the Philippine and Belgian contributions which it considered as useful reference materials that could be used in future deliberations on the issue. However, there was no convergence of views on any of the suggested criteria in both papers which were before the Group. Most members considered the issue to be very complex and difficult to resolve and it was generally agreed that it requires further continuing deliberations and consultations. In the circumstances, it was recognized that the present practice of designating members to the Board in alphabetical order is, at least for the time being, satisfactory and should be continued.
<P>
12. There was no agreement on the suggestion that the present eight-area classification in Article VI.A be changed.
<P>
13. There was equally a divergence of views on the various ideas and suggestions for amendments to Article VI which were before the Group. In fact, none of the suggested ideas enjoyed considerably wide support. Seven delegations supported the Sherry Group proposal which had been discussed at the first meeting. Four Member States supported the suggestion for an increase of six designated seats which would result in an increase of the size of the Board to 41. Five delegations supported the idea of an increase in the number of globally- advanced members by two to accommodate the Republic of Korea and Ukraine as well as an additional floating designated seat for five out of the existing eight regional groups. 16 Member States were opposed to any change in the current size of the Board. The other 16 participants expressed no views.
<P>
14. Some delegations, however, while expressing their preference for some specific idea or suggestion also indicated that they were flexible and willing to consider some variations of other ideas or suggestions if certain elements of all or some of the various ideas/suggestions that were before the Group could be combined to attain a consensus. Some delegations also indicated that they would be consulting with other like-minded delegations before the next meeting of the Consultative Group, with a view to formulating some more concrete ideas in a specific form.
<P>
15. The African Group indicated its position on the question in the following terms:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>         
(a) supports expansion of the Board to a level that will correspond to a third of total membership of the IAEA;
<P>
<DD>         
(b) prefers five regional groups instead of the existing eight regional groups; and
<P>
<DD>
(c) supports amendment of Article VI.A.2 to permit immediate "re-election" to regional seats; and
<P>
<DD>         
(d) the expansion of the Board should reflect an equitable geographical distribution of the members of the Agency, so that the under-representation of Africa is rectified and further ensure that the interests of the LDCs are well represented. (Full details of the African position are contained in Annex 5.)
<P>
</DL>
16. In the course of the discussions, other matters such as the balance between designated and elective seats and re-election to "area seats" were also taken up. It was noted by some that all the ideas/suggestions currently being discussed appear to concentrate on possible increase of designated seats and it was stressed that consideration should equally be given to probable increase in the number of elected seats. In this connection, the need to make election to regional seats under Article VI.A.2 not only equitable but also rotational within the various area groups was highlighted.
<P>
17. At its third meeting on 29 May 1995, the Open-ended Consultative Group, in addition to the earlier proposals/suggestions, also had before it the following:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>
(a) a revised "Sherry Group" proposal including the arguments in support thereto (Annex 6); and
<P>
<DD>
(b) a Moroccan proposal (Annex 7).
<P>
<DD>
51 delegations were present at this meeting.
</DL>
<P>
18. Although there was an exhaustive debate on these as well as the earlier proposals, none of the suggested proposals enjoyed a wide degree of support or consensus in the Group. Some delegations were also unable to comment extensively on the Moroccan proposal because they claimed it was received late. Similarly, although the revised Sherry Group proposal was generally considered a better formulation than its original version, many delegations were still not prepared to lend their support to it, though it was recognized as a valuable contribution to the ongoing consultations on the issue of amendment of Article VI.
<P>
19. After a further series of bilateral consultations, the Chairperson convened the fourth and final meeting of the Open-ended Consultative Group on 30 August. At the meeting, which was attended by representatives of 60 Member States, the Group concentrated on a consideration of the formal Moroccan proposal, certified copies of which had been circulated by the Director General to Member States on 15 June 1995 (Annex 8).
<P>
20. In spite of some reservations expressed by some delegations, discussion at the meeting revealed some support for the Moroccan proposal which was the only formal proposal submitted so far. It was felt that proposal constituted a good basis for further negotiations, for example on the size and distribution of seats on the Board. Some delegations however, reiterated their opposition to any increase in the current size of the Board.
<P>
21. In these circumstances, although several delegations stressed the need for a change in the current size and composition of the Board of Governors, none of the specific proposals which were considered in the Open-ended Consultative Group enjoyed sufficiently wide support to enable the Group to make a recommendation through the Board of Governors to the General Conference as requested in resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/14.
<P>
22. Similarly, on the issue of criteria for designation of members to the Board of Governors, although some delegations felt the current practice of designation requires a review, it was generally agreed that the issue is a very complex and difficult one and, therefore, required greater reflection and consultations. It was therefore recognized that the present practice of designating members to the Board in alphabetical order is satisfactory and should be continued, at least for the time being. In this connection, the Board might consider establishing an Open-ended Expert Group to consider the issue and make recommendations to it.
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION </B>
<P>
23. Following from the above, it is obvious that there is, as yet, no agreement for a change in the present size and composition of the Board. It is therefore my view that the Board should consider retaining the existing mechanism of an open-ended consultative group to continue consultations among Member States with the ultimate objective of reaching a consensus on the formal Moroccan proposal in its current or amended form after the General Conference if by that time no decision has been reached on it.

The Financing of Technical Assistance and the Financing of Safeguards
</H4>
<P>
Report by the Board of Governors
<P>
<I>(Editor's note: The addendum to this document is not included here.)</I>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
1. In resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/11, the General Conference last year, inter alia, requested the Board of Governors to re-establish, with no financial implications, the Informal Working Group - open to all Member States - on the Financing of Technical Assistance and to report on actions taken to the Conference at its thirty-ninth session.
<P>
2. Similarly, in document GC(XXXVIII)/DEC/16, the General Conference (again in 1994) decided to request the Board of Governors to re-establish the Informal Working Group on the Financing of Safeguards.
<P>
3. The Board re-established both Working Groups at its post-GC session in September last year and the two groups met separately over several months and reported to the Board at its June 1995 session. After a debate on both issues, the Board requested the two Working Groups to continue further consultations including in joint session with a view to achieving a consensus on the issues.  The Board further decided to revert to the issues at its pre-General Conference session in September this year.
<P>
4. The Board reconsidered the two issues on 12 and 13 September 1995 and decided to transmit a joint report of its deliberations on both issues to the General Conference. The summing-up by the Chairman of the Board on the two issues is set out below: 
<P>
"It seems to me that the Board wishes to recommend a target of US$ 64.5 million for voluntary contributions to the Technical Co-operation Fund (TCF) for 1996 and that it agrees that the Indicative Planning Figures for 1997 and 1998 shall provide for target increases of at least US$ 3.5 million in each of these years.
<P>
"Further, I believe that the Board wishes to recommend to the General Conference that it:
<P>
(a) urge all Member States to pledge and pay in full their shares of the targets for voluntary contributions to the TCF and urge the Agency to take due account of the extent to which Member States have paid their TCF target shares when determining the allocation of resources for TC projects and for the procurement of equipment and expert services for TC activities;
<P>
(b) urge that all Member States, in approving future Agency budgets and   contributing funds for the activities of the Agency, seek to avoid the creation of an imbalance among the main activities of the Agency; and 
<P>
(c) note that the question of predictable and dependable pledging and payments to the TCF will be kept under review.
<P>
"With regard to the financing of safeguards, I take it that the Board wishes to recommend to the General Conference:
<P>
(a) that it adopt the formula proposed by the Chairman of the Informal Working Group on the Financing of Safeguards as contained in the Note by the Secretariat dated 13 June 1995 (copy to be attached to the summary record of this meeting), with the proviso that no shielded country shall be obliged to contribute towards any increase in the safeguards budget beyond zero real growth; and
<P>
(b) that it decide that the formula shall be reviewed at an appropriate time in order to determine a formula for safeguards financing beyond the year 2000, the review to include consideration of changes in the contributions of shielded countries and other relevant issues.
<P>
"It is so decided.
<P>
"In the light of what has been decided regarding the facing of technical assistance, I take it that the Board wishes to recommend the adoption of draft resolution B in Annex VI to the budget document (GC(39)/4) with a figure of US$ 64.5 million inserted as the target for voluntary contributions to the TCF for 1996.
<P>
"It is so decided.
<P>
"What we have decided regarding the financing of safeguards should, I believe, be fully reflected in a draft resolution to be submitted to the General Conference for adoption.
<P>
"It is so decided.
<P>
"Next, we have to agree on a report to the General Conference. The two issues - i.e. the financing of technical assistance and the financing of safeguards - were initially discussed separately, but of late they have come to be discussed together, and furthermore the decisions which we have just taken deal with them both together.
<P>
"I therefore suggest that we have a single report to the General Conference on the two issues setting out the decisions which we have just taken. The positions of individual countries and groups will, of course, be reflected in the summary records of our discussions on these issues (in June and at the present session), which will also be transmitted to the General Conference.
<P>
"It is so decided.
<P>
"Finally, I wish to express to Ambassadors Akao and Doshi the Board's appreciation of their skill and indefatigable efforts in chairing the two Informal Working Groups and facilitating the resolution of these important issues through consensus in a spirit of friendliness and compromise."
<P>         
The summary records of the Board's discussions on the items at its June and September sessions are in the Addendum to this document.

<P>
1. The Director General submits herewith to the General Conference a draft resolution whereby the Conference may set, in accordance with Article XIV.D of the Statute, the scale of assessment of Members' contributions to the Agency's Regular Budget for 1996. The scale annexed to the attached draft resolution has been prepared in accordance with the principles established by the General Conference (<A HREF=#FOOTNOTE_1>*</A>) and on the assumption that the Conference will approve the revised arrangements for the assessment of Members' contributions towards the Agency's Regular Budget which are the subject of document GC(39)/23/Add.2. The scale, based on the Agency's membership as of 31 July 1995, includes one new State, Yemen, which became a Member on 14 October 1994.
<P>
2. With regard to the scale annexed to the attached draft resolution, on the basis of the revised principles set forth in document GC(39)/23/Add.2 the Director General has drawn up a list of Members meeting the criteria laid down there for partial relief in respect of their assessments of the safeguards component of the Regular Budget. The list comprises 91 Members (see Table 2 in the Appendix). The remaining 31 Members will contribute on a proportionally increased basis in order to make up the balance of the safeguards expenses.
<P>
3. It will be noted that the following draft resolution also provides for approval by the General Conference of the base rate of assessment of each Member. This has been derived from the scale used by the United Nations to assess contributions from its Members to its Regular Budget for 1995 and adopted by the General Assembly in resolution 49/19 B on 29 November 1994. The 1995 scale of the United Nations is adjusted by applying a mathematical coefficient to compensate for differences in membership between the Agency and the United Nations.
<P>
4. The calculations that were made in order to establish both the individual base rates and the resulting scale of assessment are reproduced for the information of the Conference in the Appendix.
<P>
5. Member States are urged to inform the Director General by 1 January 1996 as to when their Regular Budget contributions will be paid to the Agency. This information is required to enable the Secretariat to prepare cash forecasts on the basis of which the programme will be implemented.

<P>
Mr. Chairman,
<P>
The undersigned delegations of the Arab States, members of the League of Arab States participating in this Conference, wish to express their reservations about the credentials submitted by the Israeli delegation for the following reasons:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>
(1)  Israel has annexed the city of Jerusalem, regarding it as its capital in spite of the relevant United Nations resolutions and in particular Security Council resolutions 252, 267, 271, 298, 465, 476 and 478 adopted in various years and General Assembly resolution E 169/35 of 15 December 1980, which considered all administrative and legal measures taken after the occupation of the city of Jerusalem null and void and unlawful, and in which the General Assembly called upon all States and specialized agencies and other international organizations to disregard any measure contravening the provisions of that resolution.  You will notice that, in spite of the provisions of the above-mentioned resolution, the credentials submitted by the delegation of Israel have been issued from occupied Jerusalem;
<P>
<DD>
(2)  Israel has annexed the Syrian Arab Golan area and refused to implement the Security Council and General Assembly resolutions relating to the annulment of the annexation measures.  It continues to occupy part of South Lebanon and western Beqaa, and to refuse to apply Security Council resolution 425 on this subject.
</DL>
<P>
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

<H3>Inscription in the List of Speakers in the General Debate</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>In 1989, the General Conference adopted a procedure for determining the order of speakers in the general debate as follows <font size=-1>(2)</font>:
<DL>
<P>
<DD>(a) At a previously announced date and time, the Secretary of the Policy-making Organs shall be available for a period of one hour to receive applications from Member States wishing to speak early during the general debate.  All those  who apply during this period shall be eligible for inclusion in a ballot, which shall be held shortly after the closure of the application period. The ballot shall be organized by representatives of the Secretariat and held in the presence of any representatives of Member States who indicate a wish to  attend. The ballot shall determine an order of priority among all the participating Member States.
<P>
<DD>(b)The names of any Member States applying for inclusion in the speaker's list  after the end of the period designated for application for inclusion in the ballot shall be added to the list in the order in which they apply.
<P>
<DD>(c) By mutual agreement, Member States shall be permitted to exchange places on the speakers' list.
<P>
<DD>(d)The practice of giving special priority to Ministers shall continue, the Secretariat being guided entirely by information provided by Member States.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>Accordingly, the Secretariat of the Policy-making Organs will be available in Room  A-2873 at the Vienna International Centre from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Monday, 19 June 1995, to receive applications from Member States' representatives for inclusion in the list of speakers in the general debate at the forthcoming regular session of the General Conference. A ballot to determine the order of priority among the Member States whose representatives have applied will be held at 11 a.m. on that day.

<A NAME=item1><H3>Opening of the Thirty-Ninth Regular Session </H3></A>
<P>       
The thirty-ninth regular session of the General Conference will open on Monday, 18 September 1995, at 10 a.m. It will be held at the Austria Center Vienna (ACV), Am Hubertusdamm 6, 1220 Vienna, next to the Vienna International Centre (VIC).
<P>         
Unless otherwise decided by the Conference, morning meetings will begin at 10 a.m and afternoon meetings at 3 p.m. Delegates are requested to be in their places by those times in order to allow meetings to start punctually. If evening meetings prove to be necessary, the starting times will be announced during the session
<P>        
<HR>
<A NAME=item2><H3>Pre-Session Consultations</H3></A>
 <P>        
During the weekend preceding the opening of the Conference's session (Saturday, 16 September, and Sunday, 17 September 1995), facilities for group meetings are being made available on request. Member States are strongly urged to avail themselves of those facilities with a view to achieving agreement on organizational matters (e.g.  regarding the composition of the General Committee) before the session opens on Monday and thereby contributing to the smooth running of the Conference's session, ensuring - where necessary - that their representatives arrive in Vienna in time to participate in pre-session group meetings and the associated group decision-making.  Meeting rooms should be reserved in good time through the Secretariat's Conference Service Section.
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME=item3><H3>Notification of the Composition of Delegations</H3></A>
<P>         
Governments are requested to communicate to the Secretariat the composition of their delegations well in advance. This should be done in writing - by letter or by completing the registration form which has been transmitted to Permanent Missions Rule 23 of the Conference's Rules of Procedure provides for each Member State of the Agency to be represented by one Delegate, who may be accompanied by as many assistants (alternates, advisers, etc.) as may be needed. An unofficial edition of members of delegations will be issued on Wednesday, 13 September 1995; only those names that are received by the Secretariat before Friday, 8 September can be included in it. The first official list of members of delegations will be issued on Sunday, 17 September; it will contain information which has been communicated to the Secretariat before Friday, 15 September.
<P>         
If, during the session, changes are required in the particulars provided at the time of registration, Delegates are requested to inform Protocol in writing, so that the list of delegation members may be brought up to date.
<P>
<HR>         
<A NAME=item4><H3>Credentials of Delegates</H3></A>
<P>         
Delegates (but not other members of a delegation) will require credentials specifically for the session, even if they are already accredited to the Agency in some other capacity - for example, as Resident Representative. Credentials have to be delivered in due time; this helps to avoid difficulties, particularly for the General Committee. It is accordingly emphasized that, under Rule 27 of the Rules of Procedure, credentials should be submitted to the Director General not later than Monday, 11 September, issued either by the Head of State or Government or by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Member concerned. If credentials cannot be submitted by Friday, 15 September, Delegates should deliver them direct to the Credentials Officers at the ACV either on Sunday, 17 September, between 2:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. or on the following Monday morning.
<P>
<HR>         
<A NAME=item5><H3>Registration for Badges</H3></A>
<P>
Each participant will require a badge with a photograph for entry into the ACV during the session Badges will be issued by the staff at the Registration Desk to those designated participants who are not already in possession of a valid VIC ground pass. Badges issued for the General Conference will also be valid for entering the VIC.
<P>
Participants may register on Friday, 15 September, at the Agency's Registration Desk at the VIC between 9 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. and on Sunday, 17 September, between 2 p.m. and 6:30 p m. at the ACV Registration will continue throughout the week of the Conference's session at the Registration Desk at the ACV.
<P>         
Participants also attending the meetings of the Board of Governors which start on Monday, 11 September 1995 may register simultaneously for both the Board's meetings and the Conference's regular session at the Agency's Registration Desk at the VIC between 8.30 a.m. and 10.30 a m on Monday, 11 September and Tuesday, 12 September, provided that they inform the Secretariat of their intention to do so before Friday, 8 September.
<P>         
<HR>         
<A NAME=item6><H3>Documents</H3></A>
<P>         
Each delegation is urged to visit the Documents Distribution Centre in room FM152 at the VIC not later than Friday, 15 September, and specify its requirements for documents on a form which will be provided for this purpose. If this is not possible, delegations should apply to the Documents Station at the ACV either on Sunday, 17 September, between 2 30 p.m. and 6 30 p.m. or on the following Monday morning.
<P>         
Before the opening of the session one complete set of the Conference documents already issued will be available to each delegation.  All documents produced during the session, including the Conference Journal containing the daily programme, and other notices will also be available at the Documents Station at the ACV.  <P>         
Delegates wishing to submit draft resolutions or other documents to the Conference during the session are requested to provide the Conference Secretary or the appropriate Committee Secretary with the text as early as possible.
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME=item7><H3>Speakers in the General Debate</H3></A>
<P>        
Until the beginning of the Conference's session on Monday, 18 September, requests for inscription on the list of speakers in the general debate should be made directly, either personally or in writing, to the Secretariat of the Policy-making Organs (VIC, room A 2871). As Member States were informed by document GC(39)/INF/1, issued on 9 May 1995, inscription in the list of speakers started on 19 June 1995; a ballot was taken at 11 a.m. on that day in order to determine the order of priority among the Member States whose representatives had -- between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. -- personally made a request for inscription in the list. Since 11 a.m. on 19 June, Member States making requests for inscription in the list have been added in the order in which they made their requests. It should be noted, however, that the practice of giving priority to Ministers participating in the general debate will continue.
<P>

Delegates who have not inscribed their names on the list by the beginning of the session but wish to speak in the general debate are requested to contact the official responsible for maintaining the speakers' list, who will have a desk in Conference Room A (where the plenary meetings will take place). Delegates should also contact that official if they wish to speak on other items at plenary meetings.
<P>
<HR>         
<A NAME=item8><H3>Statements in the General Debate</H3></A>
<P>         
In order that the general debate may represent a more efficient use of the time available, Delegates are invited to keep the duration of their statements down to 15 minutes by focusing on the main points which they wish to make.
<P>         
To facilitate interpretation, texts of statements to be delivered should be handed to the Conference Officer in advance. Copies of the full texts (in the original language) will, if Delegates so request, be made available to other Delegates during the session.
<P>         
It is of considerable help if the texts of statements provided to the Secretariat are typed with double line spacing.
<P>        
<HR>         
<A NAME=item9><H3>Working Languages and Interpretation</H3></A>
<P>         
The working languages of the Conference are Arabic, Chinese, English, French Russian and Spanish, and statements made in any one of these languages will be interpreted simultaneously into the others. If Delegates wish to make a speech in a language other than the working languages, they should, under Rule 87 of the Rules of Procedure, themselves arrange for interpretation into one of the working languages and provide the Secretariat with a written text of their speech in advance in that working language.
<P>         
<HR>         
<A NAME=item10><H3>Pledges of Voluntary Contributions to the Technical Co-operation Fund for 1996</H3></A>
<P>         
The Board of Governors has not yet agreed on a recommendation to the General Conference regarding a target for Member States voluntary contributions to the Technical Co-operation Fund for 1996. For that reason, it has not yet been possible for the Secretariat to send to Member States the customary letter indicating their individual shares of the recommended target. It is expected that the Board will agree on a recommendation at its pre- General Conference meetings, whereupon the Secretariat will immediately bring the recommendation to the notice of Member States and inform them of their individual shares of the recommended target.  <P>
It would be appreciated if Governments communicated their pledges as soon as they are in a position to do so. During the session, it will be possible to communicate pledges to the Contributions Officer who will have a desk in Conference Room A. A document will be circulated for the purpose of notifying delegates of the contributions that Member States have pledged themselves to make, updated versions being issued during the session.
<P>

<A NAME=item11><H3>Special Scientific Programme Organized in Conjunction with the Conference's Session</H3></A>

<H2>Highlights</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>An overall improvement was achieved in the preparation of the TC	 Programme for 1995-96 which included 11 new Model Projects.
<P>
<LI>The financial implementation of the total TC Programme attained 69.7%, the highest rate ever achieved, with total new obligations reaching $55.2 million . 	
<P>									
<LI>Each of the four Areas in TCPM reached an implementation rate exceeding 68%. This was especially significant for Middle East and Europe which repeatedly lagged behind the other areas in previous years. 		
<P>
<LI>The unobligated balance of the TACF was reduced to $18,259,000. Only $9,030,000 was in useable funds which represented less than two months new obligations.
<P>
<LI>Pledges to the TACF reached only 72.5% of the target, the second lowest on record and a full four percentage points below that recorded for 1993. Total resources reached $52,756,000, which was about $150,000 less than in 1993. 
<P>
<LI>TCIM sustained an increased output: expert assignments were up 9.9%, equipment delivery up 30.1%, fellowships and scientific visits up 9.3% and training course participants up 12.6%.						
<P>         
<LI>The Evaluation Section assessed the impact of the Agency's RAPAT and WAMAP programmes in four Asian countries and found that there is a need for greater government commitment in implementing their recommendations as well as for a better co-ordination between the two programmes .
<P>
<LI>The preparatory phase for the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the States Party to the Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was actively supported by the TC Department. A comprehensive paper was produced in connection with Article IV of the NPT.
<P>
<LI>The new Model Project concept guided the Department's strategy for realizing a new partnership in development with Member States based on technical co-operation activities that use nuclear technologies to produce lasting impacts on end users.
<P>
<LI>The Policy Review Seminar in September, provided valuable guidance in the formulation of follow-up activities and the development of new strategies for delivering technical co-operation.
<P>

<H2>Review of the Agency's Technical Co-operation Activities</H2>
<P>
<H3>Review by Area</H3>
<P>
<B>1. Africa</B>
 <P>
43. During 1994, Africa led the four geographical regions in achieving the highest volume of programme resources delivered with a financial implementation rate of 68.9%, and continued a three year trend of increasingly higher implementation rates. This was accomplished despite the often unfavourable social and economic conditions in most African countries which can impede the delivery of technical assistance. Inadequate project staffing, aggravated by frequent personnel turnover, insufficient or poor local support and services for nuclear technology applications, and inadequate co-ordination and programming mechanisms at the national level remain the most persistent obstacles to implementing higher volumes of Agency technical co-operation in the region. Specific efforts by the Area Office to closely monitor project activities and strengthen communication and consultation with the Member  States resulted in 57 projects being closed following the achievement of their objectives.
<P>
44. The dominating activities in the region during 1994 involved the implementation of the three Model Projects approved by the Board in December 1993 and the preparation of the 1995-96 TC biennium. The new two-year programme took on particular importance in light of the new objectives for TC activities which emphasize the practical impact of nuclear technology on social and economic development in recipient countries. Pre-project assistance missions fielded to Mali and Niger using UNDP Sectoral Support funds resulted in the identification and formulation of five projects in agriculture and human health, including a project to support the application of radioimmunoassay activities in Niger and a Model Project in Mali to improve sorghum and African rice characteristics and production. The three-year project in Mali will assist the Government in developing and releasing promising mutant varieties of African rice and sorghum, with direct economic benefit to farmers and to the country's food security.
<P>
45. Monitoring missions were undertaken in 1994 to Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia. These were essential for assessing the development of local scientific infrastructure, identifying problems hindering effective technology transfer and streamlining the national programmes. These missions also produced more effective integration of Agency-supported activities in the country development process and a stronger working relationship with UNDP.
<P>
46. A multi-disciplinary mission was fielded to Namibia to assess national expertise and infrastructure, identify potential sectors where nuclear techniques can play a major role in national development, and assist in the formulation of technically sound projects. The mission covered health, agriculture and the mining industry. A Reserve Fund project was approved for Namibia to establish a basic radiotherapy unit at Windhoek Central Hospital, following the recommendations of a pre-assistance mission that identified the urgent need to provide the affected population with curative and palliative radiotherapy.
<P>
47. Substantial efforts were made in 1994 to strengthen collaboration with FAO in sub-Saharan countries. Within the framework of the FAO strategy to increase food production in support of food security in low income food deficit countries (LIFDCs), a regional project was formulated. It has the objective of applying nuclear techniques to determine the efficiency and sustainability of crop/soil systems by assisting in the selection of inputs such as fertilizer forms, rates and methods of application, pesticide and herbicide formulations and improved cultivars. Such techniques will be included in "technology packages" designed for Ethiopia, Kenya, Niger, Senegal, Tanzania and Zambia.
<P>
48. In delivering technical assistance to the region, special attention was given to the needs of least developed countries (LDCs) to build critical capacity in nuclear technique based applications in priority areas of social and economic development, particularly agriculture and human health, in order to facilitate the achievement of sustainable development. One activity of the regional project which provided institutional support to LDCs is an alternative education training programme providing a "sandwich" approach to advanced degrees in basic sciences and nuclear technology. An arrangement with the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste, will award fellowships to young scientists from LDCs to attend courses at the Centre and fulfil partial requirements for academic degrees. UNDP Sectoral Support also financed a regional workshop in Ethiopia to give participants from LDCs an opportunity to learn and apply an integrated approach to the design, management and evaluation of Agency TC projects. The workshop was attended by 24 national liaison officers and project counterparts from 10 countries, and provided a forum to address issues related to all stages of project design with emphasis on the institutional and infrastructural constraints specific to African LDCs.  Recent changes in TC policies, programming and implementation practices were also reviewed, giving particular attention to the Model Project concept and its implications for programming activities. National Co-ordinators from four LDCs received additional training at Agency Headquarters in TC procedures, programmes and policies.
<P>         
49. Applications of isotopes and ionizing radiation in food and agriculture continued to be the most important activities in the region. Substantial assistance was provided under seven regional projects and more than 60 national projects in 20 countries in plant nutrition, soil fertility, crop improvement, animal production and health, and pest control.
<P>
50. In soil science, isotope techniques were applied in C&ocirc;te d'lvoire to measure mineral and water inputs in order to optimize nutrient absorption by crop plants and identify better soil and water management practices. Biological nitrogen fixation studies played an important role in identifying and exploiting legume cultivars and symbiotic rhizobial strains capable of improving atmospheric nitrogen fixation for increased crop productivity, in assessing nitrogen economy in legume-cereal rotation systems, assessing nitrogen use efficiency in sugar beet and sugar cane, and identifying nitrogen-fixing trees.  In several countries, important results were achieved in biological nitrogen fixation. Promising new strains of rhizobial inoculant and genotypes of legume species with high nitrogen fixation efficiency were identified. An important regional project on biological nitrogen fixation initiated in 1987 concluded its planned activities in 1994, having achieved its objectives of introducing the application of technologies such as the use of inoculants to improve nitrogen fixation or crop residues and organic wastes as a source of plant nutrients.  The project has stimulated collaboration between the countries in the region.  A training course and four research workshops were held during the life of the project.
<P>         
51. Activities on the application of radiation in plant breeding and genetics continued to be supported by the Agency in eight countries. Counterparts were assisted in screening advanced mutant varieties, formulating experimental breeding programmes, and implementing in-vitro micropropagation techniques for mutation breeding of vegetatively propagated crops. Other Agency-supported activities involving multi-year TC projects and FAO/IAEA co-ordinated research programmes have resulted in the development and testing of promising new mutant varieties of some important basic food crops. Future efforts will be focused on ensuring suitability for full-field production and demonstrating the economic impact of these improved varieties. Achievements include varieties of barley and durum wheat in Algeria, barley in Libya, cassava in Ghana, wild African rice and sorghum in Mali and rice in Tanzania.
<P>  
52. Another important area of technical co-operation in Africa is in the livestock sector, where the Agency continued to assist governments (through national and regional projects), research institutions and veterinary services in the region to improve their capacity to monitor the effectiveness of animal health control programmes and to diagnose animal diseases. Particular emphasis was placed on those activities with economic significance to sub- Saharan countries, such as rinderpest, trypanosomiasis, brucellosis and babesiosis, using nuclear-based immunoassay techniques. Algeria and Morocco were also assisted to evaluate and improve vaccination campaigns against African horse sickness. Support to Madagascar has contributed to establishing new capabilities for the diagnosis of swine fever, which is particularly relevant to the economy of the country. Co-operation and exchange of information between African countries in the area of animal health were promoted through two regional projects and the provision of backstopping services by regional experts. One regional workshop on diagnosis and control methods of animal trypanosomiasis was held in Kenya. Nutritional and managerial problems limiting smallholder systems of management in Africa, such as reproductive performance and productive efficiency of indigenous and crossbreed ruminant livestock species, were the subject of several research programmes that seek to devise simple, cost-effective methods to overcome the underlying constraints. Isotope application also supported nutrition studies which assessed the feasibility of using indigenous feed resources for supplementary feeding of dairy cattle in Algeria, Cameroon, Morocco, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. An AFRA project addressed animal reproduction and nutrition issues at a regional training course held in Ethiopia.  <P>         
53. Activities aimed at applying the sterile insect technique (SIT) in integrated pest management programmes have focused mainly on the tsetse fly in view of its important social and economic relevance to sub-Saharan countries. TC projects were operational in Ghana, Mali, Nigeria and Uganda.  In Tanzania, the Model Project on Zanzibar Island suffered initially from lack of extrabudgetary funding. Contributions from Belgium, Canada, China, Sweden, the OPEC Fund, the UK and the USA, together with a substantial increase from the TACF, enabled implementation to proceed satisfactorily. In fact, the implementation rate for the project during 1994 was exceptionally high at 88.7%. With sufficient funding, full eradication of the tsetse fly is expected on the Island by 1997. Successful implementation of this project will have a lasting and significant impact on livestock development and the efficiency of farming systems in Zanzibar.
<P>        
54. The use of isotopes for the assessment of water resources, especially in arid and semi-arid zones of the region, was a major category of technical co-operation in 1994. In view of the significant role isotope techniques can play in addressing water resources management issues, the Board of Governors approved a multi-year regional Model Project designed to utilize isotope hydrology techniques in combination with other investigations to estimate recharge rates of various aquifers in Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, Mali, Morocco, Niger, Senegal and Sudan, and to provide data to develop water policy guidelines for optimal management of groundwater resources. This Model Project is based on a project identification outline developed at the planning seminar in Morocco in 1993. In Mauritius, isotope hydrology has established the link between different aquifers and demonstrated that the water supply can be expected to improve at certain times of the year if certain recommended management actions are taken.
<P>        
55. In the human health sector, the assistance provided by the Agency was essentially concerned with the application of nuclear techniques for medical diagnosis and the treatment of cancer. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) activities continued to receive high priority in 15 national projects and two regional projects which focused on the establishment of bulk reagent-based "in-house" assays for thyroid related hormones. By the end of 1994, 75 RIA facilities had been established in the 21 African countries involved. Most of these laboratories are able to produce their own quality control sera standards for T3 and T4 assays. These achievements have led to a considerable decrease in the cost of the analyses, by at least a factor of 10. Technology needed to prepare the solid phase for the immunoradiometric assay of TSH has also been successfully transferred to the region. The efforts by the Agency over the past few years to promote good or standard RIA practices in the region have permitted the introduction of an external quality assessment scheme (EQAS) for thyroid related hormones to evaluate the analytical reliability of the assay procedures based on the bulk reagent methodology.
<P> 
56. A Model Project in nuclear medicine began implementation in Tunisia in 1994 in order to establish an indigenous capability to screen newborn babies for neonatal hypothyroidism, thus providing sufficient time for prompt treatment to prevent irreversible neurological impairment and mental retardation. This project is supporting a national programme involving nine major hospitals with fully functional RIA facilities, and required a national training workshop in June 1994 on the methodology and management of the operations. All necessary reagents have now been supplied for the screening programme to begin nationwide.
<P>         
57. Projects to establish or upgrade nuclear medicine services for in-vivo diagnostics were operational in six countries in 1994. Assistance was provided to Ethiopia to develop basic infrastructure for in-house small scale manufacture of kits employed in the formulation of some technetium-99m radiopharmaceuticals. A gamma camera and accessories for clinical diagnosis and research were supplied to Kenyatta National Hospital. In Morocco, the Agency assisted the Ibn Sina Hospital to widen the scope of nuclear medicine by introducing bone, brain and kidney studies. The nuclear medicine facilities at the Muhimbili Medical Centre, Tanzania, were upgraded by introducing in- vivo techniques. In Uganda, the Agency continued assistance to Mulago Hospital by providing expert services and training personnel on the use of a gamma camera for clinical studies.  
<P>  
58. In the field of radiotherapy, assistance was resumed to Cameroon following the promulgation of the national radiation protection legislation; brachytherapy equipment was ordered for the Yaounde General Hospital and steps were taken to upgrade the teletherapy facilities at this hospital and at the General Hospital of Douala. Construction delays and lack of adequate radiation protection infrastructure have greatly affected the implementation of the radiotherapy project in Uganda. Strengthening capabilities in medical physics is the objective of Agency assistance to Algeria and Zimbabwe, while projects in Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Nigeria, Tanzania and Tunisia are assisting these countries in optimizing the utilization of radiotherapy equipment.  Particular emphasis was given to improvement of the standard practice of radiotherapy in the region through expert services and on-the-job training in dose treatment planning, quality assurance, radiation dosimetry and preventive maintenance.
<P>
59. A Model Project on national radiotherapy and nuclear medicine network was initiated in Ghana in January 1994 to establish brachytherapy and nuclear medicine services in Accra and Kumasi. Extrabudgetary contributions were received from the USA for the purchase of brachytherapy equipment for Kumasi, and China agreed to donate about $800,000 to meet priority project objectives. This project has received considerable national attention as a result of the establishment of a high level committee, under the patronage of the First Lady of Ghana, to monitor project activities. The Government of Ghana has released sufficient funds to construct adequate buildings in Accra and Kumasi to house the radiotherapy and nuclear medicine units. Construction of the building in Accra is already well ahead of schedule.
<P>
60. Increased emphasis continued to be placed on the establishment of adequate radiation safety infrastructure as an essential condition for building up viable nuclear technology capabilities in the region. Assistance was provided through more than 40 projects in 19 Member States, which established or strengthened legal frameworks, regulatory bodies and the technical capabilities required for enforcement of radiation safety standards.  The Interregional Model Projects on radiation protection and waste management provided assistance to upgrade the infrastructure of Cameroon, Ghana and Uganda. While implementation of an adequate radiation safety scheme in Cameroon has yet to be ensured, steps were taken in Uganda towards the effective enforcement of radiation safety standards through the formation of an Atomic Energy Control Board. A national authority competent in radiation safety matters was also established in Ethiopia.
<P>
61. Although efforts are still needed to ensure an acceptable level of radiation protection in the region, Agency support in 1994 has contributed to strengthening the technical capabilities of many countries in radiation protection, particularly with respect to personnel and environmental monitoring systems. Assistance was provided to Egypt, Mauritius and Zimbabwe to upgrade personnel dosimetry services. C&ocirc;te d'lvoire, Nigeria and Sudan benefitted from expert missions to consolidate their capability for measuring environmental radioactivity, particularly for food monitoring. A regional training course on environmental radiation measurement and harmonization was held in Morocco.
<P>
62. The region increased delivery of technical co-operation in the field of radioactive waste management by over 40% in 1994 Egypt received further assistance to upgrade the liquid and solid radioactive waste treatment facilities established with Agency assistance. Under the AFRA regional project, expert missions were fielded to advise on treatment of organic radioactive waste (Egypt, Morocco), disposal site selection (Kenya) and management of radioactive wastes in hospitals (Tanzania). A regional training course on radioactive waste management techniques was held in Egypt.
<P>
63. 1994 was a pivotal year for the AFRA Programme. Much effort was devoted to upstream activities that will provide new direction and vitality as the programme enters its second five year cycle (1996-2000).  Intensive consultations with AFRA Member States and donor countries have resulted in new objectives which will guide the strategy for AFRA for the coming five years and define the essential parameters that will determine AFRA's ability to plan, manage and promote the region's development in the field of nuclear science and technology and to address the most pressing needs of its Member States.  Several new guidelines and procedures were adopted in 1994 to improve the design, formulation and implementation of AFRA activities and to monitor its achievements more efficiently. The unanimous recommendation for the extension of the AFRA Agreement for a new period of five years illustrates the strong determination of AFRA Member States to share the expertise and facilities available in the region and their commitment to regional co-operation.  Three new AFRA projects will begin implementation in 1995.
<P>
64. During the year nine AFRA projects were operational. The implementation of AFRA activities in 1994 produced several results that contributed to strengthening or establishing sustainable national and regional capacities in the areas of radiation safety, non-destructive testing techniques, local preparation of radioimmunoassay bulk reagents, food preservation, crop improvement, maintenance of nuclear instrumentation and irradiation processing. Twelve training courses and workshops and four co-ordination meetings took place covering all the areas of nuclear applications noted.  Thanks to an extrabudgetary contribution from France and Spain, additional assistance was provided to several AFRA countries in support of their own efforts in the field of radioimmunoassay and non-destructive testing techniques.
<P>
65. Intensified monitoring by the Area Office, combined with increased consultations with Member States, resulted in increased training requests during the year and underscored the growing interest on the part of the recipient countries in the Agency's manpower development programmes.  Training activities, aimed at upgrading the scientific and technical knowledge and professional skills of the personnel involved in planning, formulation and execution of Agency TC projects received particular attention. Under the training programme, a regional training course on radiation protection in medical practice, emphasizing occupational protection for medical staff and patient protection during diagnostic radiology and radiotherapy, was held in Tunisia, and a regional training course on system notification, registration, licensing and control of radiation sources and installations in Tanzania.
<P>      
66. The Third Co-ordination Meeting on the Development of Radiation Protection was organized in Madagascar and attended by senior representatives from 15 African Member States to review the status of radiation safety in the region. A programme of activities to foster regional co-operation and increase the effectiveness of Agency support in the field was discussed and agreed upon.
<P>
67.   During 1994, 145 fellows received training, totalling 520 months, under the regional manpower development projects. In addition 103 fellowships for a total duration of 458 months were awarded under individual TC projects.  Fellowship training was supplemented by the organization of 14 regional training courses and eight technical workshops in virtually all areas of nuclear technology applications relevant to the Agency's TC programme in Africa. In view of the inadequacy of qualified manpower and the very large personnel turnover in certain countries, national training events were encouraged as an effective mechanism to broaden the local manpower base. This scheme was successfully implemented in Sudan where four national training courses in radioimmunoassay techniques, nuclear instrumentation and radiation protection were held in 1994. Altogether, 76 local participants, from various national institutions, have been trained through these events, which the Agency supported by providing lecturers and consumables.
<P>         
<B>2. Asia and the Pacific</B>
<P>
68. Of the four geographical regions, Asia and the Pacific, with 23.3% of the total adjusted programme, accounted for the second largest share of the TC programme in 1994. During the year, the region achieved its highest rate of overall implementation in the last five years at 68.4%.
<P>
69. Following special approval by the Board in December 1993, three Model Projects, two from China and one from Sri Lanka, became operational in 1994 and achieved an average implementation rate of almost 82%. In December 1994, the Board approved the 1995-96 TC programme, including two additional Model Projects: one in Bangladesh and the other in Mongolia. The project in Bangladesh seeks to establish the technical capacity for large scale production of biofertilizers (Rhizobium inoculum) in order to increase and sustain production of legumes such as lentil, chickpea and other stable food crops, thus contributing to Bangladesh's food security. In Mongolia, where the Government is in transition from planned to a market economy, resources are not available to rehabilitate the only Oncology Centre in the country, which faces an increasing number of cancer patients. The Model Project will upgrade the teletherapy and brachytherapy services at the Oncology Research Centre in Ulan Bator, thus improving health services and survival rates for the affected population.
<P>         
70.   During 1994, a total of 302 country and 33 regional projects were operational, including 39 approved as footnote-a/ and two new UNDP projects: one on manpower development for the safe operation of nuclear power plants (China), and the other on the use of isotopes and radiation to strengthen technology and support environmentally sustainable development as part of the Regional Co-operative Agreement (RCA) Programme. Some 74 projects, including 17 approved as footnote-a/, were closed during 1994 after achieving their objectives. Efforts, which began in 1993, to improve the quality of the 1995-96 programme intensified in 1994, as new requests were appraised with reference to Model Project criteria and redesigned, if possible, to emphasize end-user beneficiaries and socio-economic impact. With the co-operation of Member States, the number of requests was reduced from 184 for the 1993-94 cycle to 149 for the 1995-96 cycle. The 24% rejection rate, compared with 30% for 1993-94, also reflects a further improvement in project design by Member States. As a result of improved project planning, 90% of the workplans, expert job descriptions and equipment specifications were received from the counterparts by late September 1994; nearly two months earlier than in previous years. This should lead to considerable improvement in the implementation of the 1995 programme.
<P>  
71. Thailand has embarked on a national project to establish a multi-disciplinary Nuclear Research Centre, for which the Agency has been providing expert advice since 1993. A mission of three Agency staff members and one outside expert visited Bangkok early in the year to assist in preparing the final terms of reference. Several overseas suppliers have submitted bids for the Centre, which will contain a 5 MW research reactor, an isotope production facility and a waste management facility.
<P>
72. At the request of the Government of Malaysia, the Agency conducted an independent assessment of the contribution of nuclear technology to the industrial sector which covered activities supported from all external and internal sources of funding. An expert mission was fielded to Malaysia, and the report to be finalized in April 1995, will form the basis for support to the national programme under the next Five Year Development Plan.

73. Several countries with active nuclear power programmes received substantial assistance in that sector. Five national workshops were organized in Indonesia, covering NPP management, criteria for the choice of commercial NPPs, quality assurance in NPP construction, and the economics and financing of NPPs. Agency experts also assisted the Indonesian authorities in nuclear power plant siting. In 1994 two multi-expert missions were undertaken and recommendations were made to assist the Indonesian authorities in site selection. Efforts were also made to obtain support from donors and UNDP for a pipeline project in China on radioactive waste management that has been formulated according to UNDP Capacity 21 objectives. These efforts are continuing with the full support of the Government.
<P>
74. Assistance to Pakistan focused mainly on nuclear power related activities dealing with the safe operation of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) and safety related missions to the Chasma Nuclear Power Plant (CHASNUPP) site. Workshops on safety techniques were also held at KANUPP. Expert missions advised on the probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) of the 300 MW(e) Chasma NPP, and a reactor pressure vessel audit mission was fielded. An International Peer Review Service (IPERS) mission was fielded to the Republic of Korea for Yangwang 3 and 4, and a national training course was arranged on the safety optimization of NPP maintenance.
<P>  
75. The Agency assisted Viet Nam to prepare a draft ordinance on radiation control, and to help establish a National Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Authority as a regulatory organization independent from the Viet Nam Atomic Energy Commission (VINATOM). This ordinance is expected to be enacted in early 1995.  
<P>     
76. In view of the importance of geothermal exploration to China, Indonesia and Philippines, a mission was fielded to explore the potential for Technical Co- operation among Developing Countries (TCDC) in that field, within the context of the ongoing Agency hydrology project on Isotopic techniques in geothermal hydrology. Geothermal activities in the Philippines have been supported by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) with a $30 million project and the World Bank has provided a loan for development of geothermal areas. Preparations were made during 1994 for a UNDP Sectoral Support mission to the Philippines to explore the potential for inter-Agency collaboration. This mission is linked to the First Country Programme Framework (CPF) exercise which will take place in the Philippines concurrently. The CPF process will provide a solid foundation for collaboration with other development organizations, within the context of government priorities and planning.
<P>
77. As part of the ongoing programme of training in TC project procedures, a regional workshop on the design, management and evaluation of the Agency's TC projects was organized in Malaysia and a similar national workshop took place in Thailand. During these workshops the Model Project concept was discussed and the Policy Review Seminar of September 1994 previewed. Four fellows, representing Bangladesh, Myanmar, Philippines and Sri Lanka, received two to three months training on TC procedures during the year. These activities have led to improvements in the quality and implementation of TC programmes in these countries.
<P>
78. The Government of China requested an International Regulatory Review Team (IRRT) mission to evaluate the effectiveness of the regulatory process as carried out by the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA). A Reserve Fund project was approved to finance these expert services.  Recommendations were made to strengthen regulatory practices in certain areas.
<P>
79. A Reserve Fund project for Indonesia on feed supplementation for increasing livestock production was approved in September 1994. The project is intended to extend the benefits of the technology to two areas, establishing demonstration facilities and providing training to increase livestock production.  The project will use local expertise to transfer the technology to farmers to benefit end users and local Government.
<P>
80. National training courses were organized: one on Radiation Protection in Industrial Radiology in Viet Nam, one on Radiation Protection in Myanmar, and one on Emergency Planning and Preparedness in Thailand. In the field of environmental protection, a national training course on the analysis of petroleum hydrocarbons in marine sediment samples was organized in Malaysia as part of the national project on marine contaminants and sediment transport.
<P>  
81. The willingness of Member States of the region to become cash donors and make substantial in-kind contributions demonstrates RCA's growing maturity. Contributions from Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines and Thailand could reach more than $1.25 million in 1995. Two new governments, Myanmar and New Zealand, became party to the Agreement in 1994, bringing the total membership to seventeen.
<P>
82. Two long term experts were appointed to support technologies within the scope of the joint UNDP/RCA/IAEA project on the use of isotopes and radiation to strengthen technology and support environmentally sustainable development: one for non-destructive testing, based at the Office of Atomic Energy for Peace in Bangkok, and the other for tracer technology, based at the Malaysian Institute for Nuclear Technology and Research, Bangi. The Governments of Thailand and Malaysia are supporting these offices as part of their contribution to the RCA. The Chief Technical Officer of the project is based at the BATAN Centre for Application of Isotopes and Radiation, Jakarta, and this office is supported by the Government of Indonesia.
<P>
83. Fifteen TC projects were operational under the RCA Programme during 1994, four with associated Co-ordinated Research Programmes (CRPs). One additional CRP was not associated with a specific TC project, but integrated into RCA activities.
<P>
84. During the year, a number of major RCA events and meetings involving 372 participants were held which related to priority activities such as: isotope applications, radiation technology, nitrogen fixation of grain legumes, radioimmunoassay, radiation sterilization, radiation protection, training in nuclear medicine, computer assisted planning and dosimetry in radiotherapy of carcinoma of uterine cervix, compilation of human anatomical, physiological and metabolic characteristic in the region, environmental sampling, strategies for nuclear power programmes, data requirements of IAEA's planning models for energy, electricity and nuclear power with emphasis on the WASP model, nuclear information systems and emergency planning.
<P>
85. Twenty-three regional training events were carried out under the RCA and Regional Training Course Programme, giving training opportunities to 403 participants. A total of 282 expert assignments were made at the request of Member States. Major across-the-board cuts in funding at the end of 1994 for the joint UNDP/RCA/IAEA project on use of isotopes and radiation has significantly reduced the UNDP contribution. The cuts, applied to all projects in the UNDP Regional Programme in Asia, will affect project activities in 1995.  Action is being taken to minimize the effects of these cuts on the project's integrity.
<P>
<B>3. Latin America</B>
<P>
86. In December 1994 the Board approved six new Model Projects as part of the 1995-1996 technical co-operation programme for Latin America. These cover a wide range of activities: isotope hydrology and geochemistry (El Salvador); evaluation of nutrition supplements for children (Peru); screening for hypothyroidism in newborns (Uruguay); assessment of groundwater resources (Venezuela); training in nuclear medicine (Mexico); and a regional project to upgrade gamma cameras for nuclear medicine services. These new Model Projects are providing an incentive to Member States in the region to undertake projects with large impact and firm commitments from government. Therefore, the TC project requests received during 1994 for the 1995-96 Programme relate, in many cases, to activities with major impact and include the participation of the end users of the technologies to be transferred.
<P>
87. Technical co-operation in the region continued to be focused mainly on health, agriculture and radiation protection. Hydrology and environment related projects were also carried out in several countries. Technical co-operation in Haiti continued to be frozen owing to the political situation but is likely to be resumed during the latter part of 1995. Regional projects outside the ARCAL Programme continued in the areas of radiation protection, quality assurance in nuclear medicine, environmental pollution and industrial quality. These projects were implemented taking into account the activities and objectives of national projects.
<P>
88. The Agency continued its strong support to nuclear medicine and radiotherapy. In Nicaragua, a teletherapy unit with a treatment planning system and a therapy beam analyser was put into operation at the National Institute of Radiotherapy and Oncology. A teletherapy unit in Guatemala was upgraded by the provision of a cobalt-60 source. In Uruguay, a SPECT system was installed at the Nuclear Medicine Centre of the Clinical Hospital in Montevideo.  In Bolivia, one gamma camera was supplied to a hospital in Cochabamba and another to a hospital in Santa Cruz; an after-loading brachytherapy system was also supplied to the Oncology Institute, Santa Cruz. A very remarkable achievement was the production of human TSH standard by biotechnological (recombinant DNA) methods at IPEN, in Brazil. This standard is now being used within and beyond the region. Advances were made in Brazil on the use of gamma irradiation for snake venom attenuation to improve treatment for snakebite and provide immunization for animals. A regional project on radioimmunoassay for thyroid related hormones successfully introduced the bulk reagent methodology and local reagent production for T3, T4 and TSH determinations. As a result, the region is now self-sufficient in the production of T3 and T4 reagents as well as for TSH except for production of 1-125 used for labelling.
<P>
89. Significant achievements were made in the Agency's programme in Latin America to support the sterile insect technique (SIT) for the eradication of insect pests. Activities aimed at eradicating the Mediterranean fruit fly in several provinces in southern Argentina were scaled up during 1994, under a Model Project approved in December 1993 to support national efforts to increase fruit exports. Major progress was made in the Province of Mendoza where by the end of 1994 two hundred million sterile flies were being released each week over the half million hectares of orchards and urban areas of the province. Commercial fruit crops are already free of the pest and full eradication in urban areas will be attempted in the 1995-1996 season. This project achieved an impressive implementation rate of 94.8% during 1994. In Guatemala, field evaluation of fruit fly genetic sexing strains developed by the Agency's Laboratories in Seibersdorf has demonstrated their effectiveness in large scale SIT programmes, with the result that the US Department of Agriculture in Hawaii has requested these strains for production at one of its mass rearing facilities. The mass rearing facility in Arica, Chile, initiated operations in 1994, and preventive releases of sterile fruit flies are now replacing insecticide sprays along the Chile-Peru border to deal with southern migration to fly free areas.
<P>         
90. Activities in the areas of agriculture and animal husbandry during 1994 included the establishment of laboratories in Cuba to utilize nuclear techniques for plant tissue culture required in mutation breeding of sugar cane and for the development of new varieties of plantain. Laboratories were also set up for soil science studies and mutation breeding in Guatemala, where new varieties of rice and wheat continued their evaluation process.
<P>  
91. In the area of nuclear power, project implementation in Brazil was delayed by the stoppage of Angra I and the pending decision on the completion of Angra ll. Upgrading of the INEA research reactor at Santa Fe de Bogota, Colombia, continued and a contract was signed with a supplier for the provision of a new reactor core. A regional project to facilitate exchange of experience at the managerial level in construction and operation of NPPs was successfully concluded, with the participation of Argentina, Brazil, Cuba and Mexico. The methods applied and the results obtained in the project will be used as a model for the Agency's promotion of nuclear power co-operation programmes in other regions of the world.
<P>
92. Under a regional project, studies are being carried out in Chile on atmospheric contamination, while water pollution is the subject of similar activities in Argentina, Ecuador and Venezuela. Knowledge of the impact of pesticides in the environment was advanced under projects in Brazil and Panama, while an analytical base was established for determination of heavy metals in the marine ecosystems of Cuba.
<P> 
93. Several Latin American countries were undergoing restructuring processes in the nuclear sector. The Government of Argentina introduced important changes in this sector aimed at strengthening its technical capability.  The nuclear activities were distributed into three organizations. Firstly, a new Atomic Energy Commission, which is dedicated to research and development, including advanced reactors, fuel cycle, waste management, decommissioning of nuclear facilities, nuclear medicine and other applications of radioisotopes.  Secondly, the Nuclear Regulatory Authority, responsible for all the regulatory activities and, thirdly, a company dedicated to nuclear power generation, which is subjected to privatisation.
<P>
94. Efforts to strengthen radiation protection programmes in several countries continued in spite of local difficulties, and some positive results were achieved. In Guatemala a secondary standards dosimetry laboratory capable of providing services to the Central American and Caribbean region was put into operation. In Brazil, progress was made in nationwide co-operation for the management of radioactive waste.
<P>         
95. An ARCAL project to upgrade and expand national and regional capability for maintenance and repair of nuclear instruments was completed.  Several laboratories were established to provide maintenance and repair services for the region, and three specialized regional training centres were created. The ARCAL project to promote the application of isotope techniques in hydrology was also completed during 1994, having successfully supported national field hydrology projects using isotope techniques in 12 participating countries. The project was originally approved as a footnote-a/ project in 1989, and made operational through an extrabudgetary contribution from Germany and through funds from the TACF.
<P>  
96. The second phase of the ARCAL Programme, which has 18 participating Member States, was concluded in 1994. The programme has played a major role in the introduction and establishment of nuclear techniques in several countries of the region, and has effectively promoted the concept of co-operation among developing countries (TCDC) as an instrument for the implementation of regional programmes. ARCAL sponsors a forum for countries to meet regularly and discuss regional developments in their fields of interest. It has successfully established bilateral or multilateral collaboration in several fields without assistance from the Agency. Member States continued in 1994 to work on the implementation of a strategic plan to strengthen the ARCAL Programme for the third phase (1995-1999).
<P>
97. Three Reserve Fund projects were approved during 1994. In Venezuela, where the increasing demand for drinking water in Caracas has required the Government to increase its groundwater hydrology activities, the Agency supported the application of isotope techniques to define the proper exploitation of the available water resources in co-ordination with new drilling priorities. In Peru, a Reserve Fund project was approved in order to carry out preliminary measurements of the nutritional status of a sample population for the Institute of Nutritional Research, in preparation for a proposed Model Project on nuclear techniques to improve child nutrition, approved by the Board in December. Reserve Funds financed a regional project to ameliorate safety problems in the use of computerized Treatment Planning Systems in Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Venezuela.
<P>
<B>4. The Middle East and Europe</B>
<P>
98. The main developments during 1994 related to the expansion of priority activities and the increased number of recipient countries in the two areas.  The Area Office handled technical assistance projects from Portugal to Afghanistan in Central Asia, and from Yemen, near the Horn of Africa, to Estonia in the Baltic Sea. During 1994 three new states in Europe and Central Asia joined the Agency. Although several of the Newly Independent States (NIS) were not yet IAEA Member States, the Department of Technical Co- operation responded to the Board of Governor's request to send fact-finding missions to a number of these countries through joint programming activities with UNDP, utilizing contingency funds approved by the Board. By the end of 1994, 37 Member States in the region were involved in the Agency's TC Programme.
<P>         
99. This last decade has been one of rapid growth in the volume of the region s TC Programme. It has grown from $7.7 million in 1985 to over $18 million in 1994. Equally important is the fact that in recent years the programme has become much more complex with the new emphasis on impact and with efforts to address a wider range of technically and economically challenging issues. The introduction of three Model Projects in 1994 dealing with- nuclear safety and electron beam purification of flue gases brought new impetus to the region's TC activities, which continued with the Board's approval in December 1994 of the 1995-1996 TC Programme that includes a new regional Model Project on rinderpest sero-monitoring. This project will be managed by the Section for West Asia. This new Section, formed from the reorganization of the former Middle East and Europe Section, will facilitate better response to the different needs of Member States in the two regions.
<P>  
100. While the most obvious technical issue facing a number of countries in the region during 1994 was the introduction or continued utilization of nuclear power as a reliable, safe and economical energy source, the scope of the ongoing efforts in this region are much wider. Human health, industry, agriculture, water resources and animal production are other priority areas of technical co-operation being implemented. These activities have a strong socio-economic dimension that require higher levels of organization and government commitment. The growing number of projects in these areas has resulted in the introduction of a number of new procedures and programming mechanisms, mentioned in the General Issues section of this Report. During 1994, some 66 projects in the region were closed, most having achieved their objectives. This important step will have promising consequences on programme implementation during the next two years. The gradual shift to fewer and larger scale projects, combined with the restructuring of the two new Sections, will enable the Department to continue to provide high quality support to the governments of these regions within the confines of a very restricted administrative budget.
<P>
101. In the Eastern European sub-region a marked emphasis was placed during 1994 on nuclear safety, regulation, radioactive waste and spent fuel management, as well as reactor maintenance, including in-service inspection and quality assurance. Particular attention was given to ongoing nuclear power programmes in Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine. Many institutions in the Middle East, on the other hand, continued to concentrate on the peaceful applications of atomic and isotope techniques in medicine, hydrology, agriculture and industry, radioisotopes and radiation. Nuclear techniques were applied to improve crop production, to determine and manage groundwater resources, to sterilize medical products, and for radioimmunoassay, non-destructive testing, quality control of industrial products, and the study of environmental pollution. Early warning environmental radiation monitoring systems have also been expanded in the region to deal with the possibility of a local or international radiation accident. The emphasis in many of these applications is making the technology serve people, an important link to applying sustainable human development to the Agency's TC activities.
<P>
102. In the area of environmental protection, the Agency continued to assist the Government of Poland with the development of electron beam technology to remove toxic pollutant gases such as SO2 and NOX from industrial flue gases. This Model Project was initiated in 1994 to develop the first industrial scale plant utilizing electron beam technology at the Pomorzany electric power station in Szczecin. Several design and technical review meetings were held during the year and the equipment specifications were finalized. However, owing to delays in extrabudgetary funding, it was not possible to fully implement the planned activities for 1994. The financial implementation rate for the project during the year was only 2.8%, as it was deemed imprudent to commit the core budget beyond design and technical review functions without a firm extrabudgetary commitment. An extrabudgetary contribution of $300,000 from UNIDO's Japanese funds in trust is expected to be confirmed shortly.
<P>  
103. The high priority associated with nuclear safety within the European region was reflected in the increased number of safety review missions fielded in 1994 under the Agency's OSART and ASSET programmes. Eight ASSET seminars and review missions were carried out under TC projects, three of them in Ukraine. In 1994, IPERS and OSART missions were sent to the Krsko NPP at the request of the Government of Slovenia and financed from TACF.  Assistance was also provided for upgrading nuclear and operational safety at the plant, including seminars and workshops organized and funded under a footnote-a/ project financed by the USA.
<P>
104. Member States operating WWER-type reactors continued to receive support from the Agency under the regional programme on in-service inspection (ISI) design. A workshop was held at Paks NPP on WWER-440 ISI of reactor pressure vessels. A second seminar on ISI was hosted by the Loviisa NPP in Finland. This is the first time that the results of the Agency's ISI programme and the experience of Paks and Loviisa NPPs were shared by all the WWER operating countries.
<P>
105. The Model Project for Hungary to improve the operational safety and the general safety culture at Paks NPP began a successful implementation in 1994 and is on schedule for 1995. The project will restructure the training system at Paks in accordance with the recommendations of TECDOC-525 (Systematic Approach to Training (SAT)), and upgrade the Paks maintenance training centre in order to enhance safety culture in line with I NSAG-4 directives. This Model Project is a complex multi-year undertaking involving several institutions in Hungary, and an overall investment of over $10 million.  This contribution includes an Agency input (both core and extrabudgetary) as well as additional contributions from the USAID Programme and through the European Commission within the scope of the Poland and Hungary Action for Restructuring the Economy Regional Programme (PHARE). The implementation rate for the project in 1994 was over 80%, with all three planned objectives of the project achieved: the introduction of SAT in the training of NPP personnel; the upgrading of the maintenance training centre; and the enhancement of safety culture. The PHARE 93 project was launched to develop training programmes which would be implemented at the maintenance training centre, and was financed from extrabudgetary contributions by Japan, Spain and the USA. The success of this project is clearly due to the full support and commitment of the Government and its technical co-operation partners.
<P>
106. Increased emphasis was given to the development of adequate nuclear regulatory and licensing infrastructures, particularly through projects in Armenia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine. Under a regional project, several workshops and training courses were organized to share the regional experience on the development of national nuclear legislation, regulatory control of nuclear power plants, and licensing procedures during commissioning. The project workplan was established early in 1994 through a co-ordination meeting in Kiev where the entire region was represented together with experts from the European Union.  Similarly, the Model Project for Slovakia, to strengthen nuclear safety and regulatory capabilities which began implementation in 1994, had significant impact on the Slovak National Regulatory Authority (NRA) by increasing staff.  The expert advice provided during the missions led the NRA to develop an effective internal structure covering all its duties. The expert advice also enabled the NRA to develop a set of internal procedures including inspection guidelines and a programme of activities. The Agency provided management training to NRA staff on setting up an internal training organization and on specific inspection topics. The first draft of an internal training programme for NRA staff was prepared. Following the recommendations of the expert mission in January 1994, the NRA has prepared its first annual status report on the safety of nuclear installations in the country, including the significant safety actions taken.
<P>  
107. Storage of spent fuel continued to be a pressing concern for Eastern European Member States operating WWER-type reactors. Previously, spent fuel from these countries was returned to the former USSR for reprocessing, but this solution for all spent fuel requirements is no longer guaranteed. The Agency continued to pay close attention to radioactive waste management and spent fuel storage, particularly in Ukraine, and to assist Bulgaria in putting into operation a radioactive waste treatment system. A regional project for WWER-type NPPs on radioactive waste management was completed and TECDOCs were published. As a result, recommendations have been made on existing policies, strategies, legislation, organization and the structure of regulatory bodies dealing with radioactive waste management, and on comparative evaluation of the radioactive waste management systems of WWER-type NPPs. A computer programme was developed as an evaluation tool.
<P>
108. Other regional TC projects relating to safety assessment of the WWER- type reactors were completed in 1994. Beginning in 1988 and completed at a total cost of $453,342 in November 1994, the Agency provided an extensive programme of training and education for probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) practitioners and assisted in developing a plant specific Level 1 and Level 2 PSA in each participating country (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Russia and Ukraine). In 1994 the activities concentrated on specific methodological support in the area of human factors (recoveries), data processing, Level-2 PSA, and treatment of external events, including seismic PSA and fire hazard analysis. Several basic PSA seminars were organized in Slovakia and Ukraine on PSA application for WWER reactors. A database was also developed using plant specific data input from eight WWER sites in all participating countries. Five TECDOCs were published relating to these activities. Based on the experience of regional co-operation on WWER-440, a similar safety assessment of WWER-1000/320 reactors has been initiated in response to a request from Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Ukraine.  Regional co-operation was successful on the MELSIM trainer/simulator installed at Bohunice NPP which is used as a tool for severe accident simulation to evaluate accident management strategies, assess complex interfaces between emergency operating procedures and to provide accident management guidelines. China and Pakistan have also expressed interest in the simulator.
<P>         
109. The first phase of the regional project on environmental restoration of contaminated nuclear sites was completed in 1994, and the final workshop, on the technologies available to support environmental restoration in the countries of the region was held in the Czech Republic. The second phase begins in 1995, with a more limited range of environmental conditions and focusing on uranium mining and milling.
<P>  
110. Regional collaboration in the Middle East provided opportunities to pool knowledge and resources in nuclear research activities. Cyprus, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates have been active in several regional projects, while Lebanon recently joined a number of ongoing programmes. Afghanistan could not take part owing to the political situation in the country. Qatar continues to build up infrastructure and manpower to enable it to participate fully in the regional activities; Yemen is expected to join in the regional activities in the near future.
<P>
111. In the area of food security, activities in the regional project on nitrogen fixation and water balance studies during 1994 included a co-ordination meeting and a training workshop in Jordan where participants from Jordan, Cyprus, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates presented results of their national activities in crop rotation, nitrogen fixation, fertigation (application of fertilizers to crops through drip irrigation) and other soil-water balance relationship studies. The project is designed to promote regional collaboration in agricultural practices with the objectives of increasing food production, and strengthening existing national projects in fertigation and biological nitrogen fixation in grains and legumes. Efforts to strengthen capabilities in the Middle East for monitoring food and environmental contamination by natural and man-made radionuclides also continued successfully in 1994. The establishment of food and environmental contamination laboratories is a common objective in several national TC projects, as well as in the regional project on environmental monitoring. The impact and sustainability of these projects is expected to be significant.
<P>
112.  In 1987, a regional project was initiated to establish Early Warning Environmental Radiation Monitoring Systems (EWERMS) in the Middle East.  By 1994, EWERMS stations had been established in most countries in the region with the capability to alert populations to higher than normal levels of radiation, such as would occur in the event of nuclear accident. The final Working Group Meeting on the development of EWERMS in the Middle East was organized in Syria.
<P>
113. In the field of isotope hydrology, the Agency has been promoting environmental studies to estimate the recharge rates of aquifers from rain and surface waters, the age of groundwater, and the interconnections between surface and groundwater in arid and semi-arid countries of the Middle East region. During the life of the regional project, which was completed in 1994, several expert missions were fielded to the participating countries in the region to advise on sampling, sample preparation, and on analytical and data interpretation techniques. Towards the end of the project, Agency staff and experts carried out individual missions to Member States in the region to review national programmes and to advise on sampling techniques and the interpretation of results.
<P>         
114. During 1994, the programme of regular regional training courses for the Middle East and Europe addressed a number of priority interests for its Member States. Most of the training related to radiation and nuclear safety and included topics such as seismic safety and risk-based optimization of tasks and procedures in NPPs, the management of spent radiation sources, and medical preparedness for radiation accidents. Other courses covered radiotherapy treatment planning and isotope and radiation techniques in agriculture.  Participants from the region also took part in the interregional training programme, and in the training courses and workshops which were organized as national and regional project activities.
<P>  
115. Since 1993, fact-finding missions have been sent to Belarus, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova and Uzbekistan. From this basis the Department of Technical Co-operation, in co-operation with the technical divisions (NENS and NENF), prepared a basic national and regional programme of assistance for these countries covering radiation protection infrastructure, nuclear safety, and waste management. The programme was approved by the Board of Governors in December and will be implemented within the 1995-96 TC Programme. It will cover some urgently needed activities such as radiation protection in human health and industry as well as dosimetry and calibration systems. However, the resources required to upgrade civil nuclear infrastructure in the NIS are beyond the means of the Agency. The UNDP and other funds could make a major contribution if they become available. By the end of 1994, total assistance delivered by the Agency to the NIS amounted to approximately $1,400,000. A number of footnote-a/ projects for the NIS that were approved as part of the 1995-96 programme still await financing.
<P> 
116. A joint UNDP/IAEA fact-finding mission was sent to Belarus which provided base data to determine and prioritize requirements to upgrade nuclear safety and radiation protection infrastructure. Other countries of the former USSR are also included in the project. A TC pre-project mission reviewed all proposals requested by the Government of Belarus for the next cycle. Both these missions contributed to the reformulation of Belarus' 1995-96 TC Programme.
<P>
117. UNDP Sectoral Support funds financed a multi-disciplinary expert mission to Croatia late last year to assess TC requirements in the energy and health sectors. The findings and recommendations of the mission are being used by the Government to formulate sectoral TC programmes and a high priority radiotherapy project for which funding is being sought from UNDP and other sources.
<P>
118. Reserve Fund projects included an ongoing assessment in Armenia of the seismic safety of the Medzamor NPP, and a new project opened in 1994 to support restructuring for the Armenian Regulatory Body. It should be recognised that the Agency's role in NPP assessments is only advisory.  
<P> 
119. The 1993 fact-finding mission to Estonia and Latvia made it possible to address some of the urgent needs in these countries through ongoing 1994 TC projects in occupational dosimetry, radiation protection in hospitals and other sources, new nuclear safety legislation, radwaste treatment and disposal, and environmental monitoring. In April 1994, a training course on radiation protection and waste management in nuclear medicine was organized in Tallinn for participants from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine. As a result of these activities, Reserve Fund projects to strengthen radiation protection and waste management infrastructure were established for Estonia and Latvia during 1994. In December 1994, the Government of Estonia requested the Agency to assist it in investigating the state of health of individuals suffering irradiation injuries as a result of an accident. A series of recommendations resulted and the full report was presented to the Government, including actions to improve the short term response to the problem of uncontrolled radiation sources.
<P>         
120. In January 1994, a fact-finding mission was carried out in Lithuania, which was later invited to nominate participants to attend interregional training courses and other regional activities. Several trainees were sent to Spain for a special training programme on nuclear power safety issues, offered by the Government. The mission was also successful in co-ordinating IAEA assistance with the substantial bilateral assistance provided by Sweden to the Ignalina NPP. The result was a TC Reserve Fund project for Lithuania during 1994 to strengthen its radiation protection and waste management infrastructure.
<P>  
121. In Kazakhstan, further radiological safety assessment reviews were conducted in conjunction with an ongoing Reserve Fund project designed to assess the radiological situation at the Semipalatinsk site. Another TC Reserve Fund project was later established for Kazakhstan to strengthen its radiation protection and waste management infrastructure. Kazakhstan participated in the second workshop under the regional project on environmental restoration held in April 1994 in Prague, as well as other regional activities and the interregional training courses. A fact-finding mission went to Kazakhstan in 1994, to investigate the possible causes of the Caspian Sea's water level fluctuations. This mission went on to visit Turkmenistan, Iran and Azerbaijan, and resulted in the formulation of a preparatory regional project to begin co-ordination activities and a footnote-a/ project to undertake a comprehensive study of the phenomenon using isotope hydrology techniques.
<P>
122. The pressing needs of Kyrghyzstan and Moldova, which are not yet IAEA Member States obliged the DG to approve Reserve Fund projects in 1994 to assist authorities with urgently needed radiological assessments.
<P>
123. The former USSR was not a recipient of the Agency's technical co- operation. Its successor, the Russian Federation, has urgent needs related to operational safety of NPPs, environmental monitoring and restoration, and other pressing requirements. Experts from the country were invited to participate in several regional activities, especially those related to WWER safety and training, along with several interregional training courses during 1994. Fellowship training was also awarded to Russian nationals. A fact- finding mission concerning the regional Caspian Sea project visited Russia, as one of the five riparian states, in 1994.
<P>
124. Uzbekistan became a Member State of the Agency in 1994 and participated in various regional activities. With UNDP funding, an INSARR mission was sent early in 1994. A Reserve Fund project was also established for Uzbekistan during 1994 to strengthen its radiation protection and waste management infrastructure.
<P>         
<B> 5. Interregional</B>
<P>
125. Technical assistance provided by the Agency through national and regional projects was effectively supplemented in 1994 with interregional TC activities, including ten multi-year advisory and promotional projects and 18 interregional training courses covering a range of nuclear applications and supporting activities of common interest to a large number of developing Member States worldwide.
<P>
126. The year under review saw further strengthening of interregional activities in the fields of radiation protection and waste management. In addition to three ongoing interregional projects designed to assist developing Member States in planning radiation protection and waste management programmes, two different but integrated Model Projects were initiated to provide practical multi-component assistance to selected Member States with inadequate radiation safety infrastructure in order to upgrade to the levels established by the Agency. Basic guidelines have been elaborated to assess and improve radiation protection and waste management infrastructures in developing Member States and to support ongoing activities in six countries.  Using this new integrated approach, the Agency carried out a detailed assessment of the existing radiation protection and waste management infrastructure in several Member States including Albania. As a result, a plan of action for the next few years was drawn up to address infrastructural components that are lacking or inadequate. Subject to approval of the plan by the Government of Albania, the Agency will provide assistance through two new national projects.
<P>
127. Five group training events and two expert missions were carried out under an interregional project designed to assist developing countries in siting and seismic review of research and power reactors. The capability of the participating countries to perform independent siting studies was strengthened, leading to increased safety of nuclear installations.
<P>
128. Under two multi-year interregional projects, three programme review missions and 23 pre-project assistance missions conducted in 1994 helped the countries concerned to tailor their requests for technical co-operation to the goals and priorities of their own national development and to design TC projects in such a way as to ensure effective implementation.
<P>
129. A total of 436 scientists and engineers from developing countries participated in interregional training courses in 1994. Half of the courses were devoted to nuclear power, nuclear fuel cycle, nuclear safety and radiation protection and covered such topics as electric system expansion planning, quality assurance in NPP operation and maintenance, qualification of NPP personnel, options in nuclear fuel cycle activities, safety assessment of NPPs and radioactive waste disposal facilities, prevention and management of accidents in NPP operation, and radiation protection. The rest of the courses were devoted to the application of isotopes and radiation in various sectors of national economy and social infrastructure, in particular diagnosis and control of animal diseases, plant mutation breeding, insect and pest control, and studies of pesticides in food and the environment. Other training courses related to the application of isotopes and radiation in human health, hydrology, environmental research and monitoring, as well as on nuclear electronics and interfacing in nuclear experiments.
<P>         
130. Interregional activities accounted for over 6% of the total adjusted TC programme for 1994, with an implementation rate of nearly 82%.

<H3>Statement by the President of the Philippines Fidel V. Ramos on the French Decision to Resume Nuclear Testing in the South Pacific</H3>
<B>21 June 1995</B>
</CENTER>
<P>         
I wish to inform you that I have written personally to His Excellency Jacques Chirac, the President of the Republic of France, conveying to him the deep concern of the Government of the Philippines over the decision of his Government to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific.
<P>
I conveyed to the French President the Philippine view that a resumption of nuclear testing is inimical to the promotion of the kind of international climate we need in order to promote further nuclear arms control and disarmament. I reiterated the support of the Philippines for the eventual conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.
<P>
Our Department of Foreign Affairs also conveyed a diplomatic note to the French Embassy, and to the French government through the Philippine Embassy in Paris, on the same subject. The note protested the French decision on the resumption of testing.
<P>
We sincerely hope that the Government and people of France will reflect carefully on the concern and sentiments that have been so clearly expressed by the members of the international community, and most especially by our friends in the South Pacific who will be most directly affected by any hazardous consequences of nuclear testing.
<P>
At this point, let me stress that the Philippines and France have traditionally enjoyed good relations in many fields. We will continue developing this relationship, which has proved to be mutually beneficial and which has the potential for even greater growth and diversification in the years ahead. It was precisely the intention of my visit to France last year to deepen and broaden our bilateral ties, considering that we have a great deal of interest in both countries to bring Europe and Asia closer together through our mutual interaction.
<P>
At the same time, we are dismayed at this decision of the French Government, which has tremendous implications for both international and regional security and stability. As a friend of France in the Asia-Pacific region, the Philippines calls on the French Government to recognize its responsibilities in a global context by seriously and immediately reconsidering its decision.

<H3>Statement by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries on the Testing of Nuclear Weapons</H3>
<B>July 1995</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
The Movement of Non-aligned Countries condemns the recent tests conducted by a nuclear weapons State as well as the decision by another State to its moratorium and to resume testing soon. The Movement remains unequivocally opposed to nuclear tests of any kind in all environments, particularly in the light of consistent efforts by the international community to further promote measures for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects as well as to preserve global environment.
<P>
The Movement reiterates its call upon the nuclear weapon States to take positive steps towards fulfilling their obligations as regards the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. In particular, The Movement has consistently urged the  nuclear weapon States, as a matter of highest priority, to a universal, internationally and effectively verifiable, comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT) without any provisions for exceptions. Pending the conclusion of such a treaty, these States were called upon to suspend all testing. The decision of State Parties adopted at the conclusion of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty had also urged them to exercise the utmost restraint. The member States of the Movement Parties to the Treaty demands that the nuclear weapon States honour both the letter and spirit of the Treaty as well as the "Declaration of Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament", which they negotiated and agreed upon.
<P>
The Movement commends those States which have not conducted tests since 1992 and  urges all nuclear weapon States to refrain from conducting any tests during the CTBT negotiations and until its entry into force, as it considers the conclusion o, the CTBT as an essential  step towards achieving the goal of complete elimination of nuclear weapons.
<P>
The Movement calls upon the Conference on disarmament to work towards the speedy conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty no later than 1996. No tests should take place under any pretext or for any reason, including the so-called safety and reliability of nuclear weapons.

The text of a note verbale dated 10 August 1995 which the Director General has received from the Permanent Mission of Iraq is - as requested - reproduced for the attention of the General Conference.
<P>
"The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Iraq presents its compliments to the International Atomic Energy Agency and with reference to the Agency's message No. N3.31-2-IRQ/A1. 10.2 dated 27 July 1995 regarding the right of Iraq to vote in the coming thirty-ninth regular session of the IAEA General Conference to be held on 18 September 1995 in Vienna and would like to state the following:
<P>
"As a result of a number of resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council a total embargo was imposed on the Republic of Iraq since August 1990. The embargo is still in effect. In addition, the said resolutions have resulted in freezing all Iraqi assets abroad and all banks were ordered not to effect any transactions on behalf of Iraq. Thus force majeure conditions were created which prevent Iraq from  paying its assessed contribution to the regular budget.
<P>
"The Mission would like to emphasize that Iraq has always made good on its financial contributions to the IAEA prior to the present situation. Iraq will make every effort to fulfill its obligations as soon as conditions permit it to do so.  <p> "The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Iraq requests that this note is brought to the attention of the General Conference with a view to restoring its right to vote in accordance with article XIX.A of the Statute.

<STRONG>Australia Condemns Chinese Nuclear Tests</STRONG>
<P>
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, has condemned today's nuclear test by China
<P>
The explosion, which took place at Lop Nor at 1406 (AEST) was detected by the Australian seismological Centre. It had a yield estimated at the equivalent of between 40 and l 50 kilotons of TNT.
<P>
Senator Evans said it was deeply disappointing that China had once-again shown disregard for international opposition to nuclear testing, and, all the more so, in the positive aftermath of the Review and extension conference of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which concluded in New York last week
<P>
"Australia, along with many other countries, protested against the nuclear tests carried out by China in June and October 1994. We have consistently urged China to join other nuclear weapon states in declaring 2 moratorium on its testing program," he said.
<P>
Senator Evans said the negotiations on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which had been a long-standing Australian goal, were moving steadily towards conclusion. Australia was hopeful that the Treaty would be finalised by the end of the year, and open for signature in l 996. We looked to the nuclear weapon states to desist from further testing as the CTBT negotiations entered this final, critical stage.
<P>
"China's continued testing is out of step with the positive atmosphere of the CTBT negotiations, as well as with China's own support for nuclear disarmament and its stated commitment to negotiation of a CTBT by l996.
<P>
"China, and other nuclear weapon states, must come to terms with the imminent fact of a ban on nuclear testing for 311 time and in all environments," he said.
<P>
Senator Evans said he had instructed the Australia Embassy in Beijing to convey Australia's concerns about the test to the Chinese authorities.

RESUMPTION OF FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING: STATEMENT BY PRIME MINISTER
<P>
AUSTRALIA DEPLORES FRANCE'S DECISION TO RESUME NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC, ANNOUNCED BY PRESIDENT CHIRAC ON 13 JUNE.
<P>
AUSTRALIA IS ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO NUCLEAR TESTING BY ANY NUCLEAR WEAPON STATE. IN RECENT MONTHS WE HAVE MADE OUR OPPOSITION VERY CLEAR TO THE FRENCH, INCLUDING TO PRESIDENT CHIRAC.
<P>
FRANCE'S DECISION IS ALL THE MORE REGRETTABLE GIVEN THAT THE MORATORIUM IT HAD OBSERVED ON NUCLEAR TESTING TOGETHER WITH THOSE OF THE US, RUSSIA AND THE UK, WAS AN INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE STRENGTHENING OF GLOBAL NON-PROLIFERATION. FRANCE LAST CONDUCTED A NUCLEAR TEST IN JULY 1991, AND ANNOUNCED A MORATORIUM ON ITS NUCLEAR TESTING PROGRAM IN APRIL 1992.
<P>
THE ACTIONS OF BOTH FRANCE AND CHINA (WHICH CONDUCTED A TEST ON 15 MAY) RUN COUNTER TO THE UNDERTAKINGS THEY MADE AT THE RECENT NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY REVIEW AND EXTENSION CONFERENCE TO EXERCISE "UTMOST RESTRAINT" IN NUCLEAR TESTING.
<P>
AUSTRALIA HAS WELCOMED THE COMMITMENT MADE AT THE NPT REVIEW AND EXTENSION CONFERENCE TO THE COMPLETION OF THE NEGOTIATIONS FOR A COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY NO LATER THAN 1996. ANY FURTHER TEST BY ANY OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPON STATES WOULD INEVITABLY CLOUD THE POSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE ATMOSPHERE OF THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY NEGOTIATIONS IN GENEVA.
<P>
WHILE I NOTE THAT PRESIDENT CHIRAC'S ANNOUNCEMENT FORESHADOWS THAT THE NUMBER OF NUCLEAR TEST WILL BE LIMITED TO EIGHT BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 1995 AND MAY 1996, I EMPHASISE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS LOOKING TO THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATES TO DESIST FROM FURTHER TESTING AS THE CTBT NEGOTIATIONS ENTER THIS FINAL AND CRITICAL STAGE.
<P>
AS CHAIRMAN OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM I WILL BE IN CONTACT WITH MY SOUTH PACIFIC COLLEAGUES ABOUT REGISTERING OUR STRONG OBJECTIONS TO FRANCE'S DECISION TO RESUME TESTING, AND OUR CONCERN AND ITS IMPLICATIONS, INCLUDING FOR THE SOUTH PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE ZONE TREATY. AUSTRALIA HAS REPEATEDLY URGED FRANCE TO ACCEDE TO THE PROTOCOLS OF THE TREATY. DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS AT THE NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY REVIEW AND EXTENSION CONFERENCE IN MAY, FRANCE UNDERTOOK TO GIVE EARLY CONSIDERATION TO DOING SO.
<P>
IN PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO FREEZE COOPERATION BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND FRANCE IN THE DEFENCE FIELD AT ITS EXISTING LEVEL, WHILE ANY NEW TESTING PROGRAM CONTINUES.
<P>
THE AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY IN PARIS HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED TO CONVEY AUSTRALIA's PROTEST TO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT.

FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
CABINET MET LAST NIGHT TO CONSIDER FURTHER AUSTRALIA'S RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT CHIRAC'S ANNOUNCEMENT ON 13 JUNE THAT FRANCE WOULD RESUME NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC.
<P>
CABINET'S DELIBERATIONS WERE AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE FRENCH REJECTION OF THE EFFORTS OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM DELEGATION, LED BY SENATOR EVANS, TO PERSUADE FRANCE NOT TO PROCEED WITH THE TESTS.
<P>
AUSTRALIA'S RESPONSE TO THE FRENCH DECISION HAS BEEN STRONG, UNEQUIVOCAL AND CONCRETE.
<P>
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ATTACKED THE DECISION IN VERY STRONG TERMS - FIRST IN A STATEMENT I ISSUED ON 14 JUNE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING ON PRESIDENT CHIRAC'S ANNOUNCEMENT DEPLORING THE DECISION . I ANNOUNCED IN THAT STATEMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD FROZEN COOPERATION WITH FRANCE IN THE DEFENCE FIELD. THE LANGUAGE OF THAT STATEMENT WAS REPEATED BY THE FOREIGN MINISTER, IN JAPAN AT THE TIME, IN A SERIES OF PRESS CONFERENCES, AND IN A DIRECT TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER, MR HERVE DE CHARETTE. THE ACTING FOREIGN MINISTER CALLED IN THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR AND ISSUED A FORMAL PROTEST AND OUR AMBASSADOR DID LIKEWISE IN PARIS.
<P>
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO TAKEN THE LEAD IN PROMOTING A STRONG SOUTH PACIFIC REGIONAL ACTION. ON 15 JUNE, I ISSUED A STATEMENT AS CHAIR OF THE FORUM CONDEMNING THE FRENCH DECISION, AFTER CONSULTATIONS WITH MY FELLOW SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM HEADS OF GOVERNMENT. ON 19 JUNE SENATOR EVANS LED A DELEGATION OF FORUM REPRESENTATIVES WHICH CONVEYED DIRECT TO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT THE REGION'S CONDEMNATION OF THE DECISION AND THE DEEP RESENTMENT IT HAS AROUSED IN THE WHOLE REGION.
<P>
THE GOVERNMENT GAVE INSTRUCTIONS TO ITS EMBASSIES ABROAD TO MAKE OUR POSITION KNOWN ON THE FRENCH DECISION. MANY COUNTRIES HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE TESTS, INCLUDING A NUMBER OF OUR CLOSEST NEIGHBOURS.
<P>
AUSTRALIA HAS ALSO MADE ACTIVE USE OF MULTILATERAL FORUMS TO LEAVE NO DOUBT AS TO WHERE WE STAND ON THIS ISSUE. WE HAVE EXPRESSED OUR OUTRAGE AT THE FRENCH DECISION IN THE UNITED NATIONS IN NEW YORK, AS WELL AS THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY IN VIENNA AND THE CONFERENCE ON DISARMAMENT IN GENEVA.
<P>
ON 19 JUNE I MADE A SPEECH IN PARLIAMENT SETTING OUT THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEWS ON THE DECISION AND AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH FRANCE.
<P>
CONCERNED ABOUT FLOW-ON CONSEQUENCES OF THE FRENCH DECISION, I HAVE INSTRUCTED OUR AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON TO WELCOME THE CONTINUED US COMMITMENT TO ITS MORATORIUM AND URGE THE UNITED STATES TO MAINTAIN ITS LEADERSHIP IN NEGOTIATING A COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY (CTBT) IN TERMS ACCEPTABLE NOT ONLY TO THE NUCLEAR WEAPON STATES BUT THE WIDER INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. OUR AMBASSADORS IN BEIJING, LONDON AND MOSCOW WILL ALSO BE MAKING REPRESENTATIONS TO THE OTHER NUCLEAR WEAPON STATES IN FAVOUR OF THE MORATORIUM ON TESTING AND EARLY CONCLUSION OF THE CTBT.
<P>
BY ANY MEASURE THIS AMOUNTS TO AN UNEQUIVOCAL RESPONSE. I AM IN NO DOUBT THAT THE FRENCH ARE CLEAR ABOUT OUR VIEWS.
<P>
LAST NIGHT, CABINET - AFTER HEARING A REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM SENATOR EVANS - DECIDED UPON A SERIES OF FURTHER MEASURES NOW TO BE TAKEN AND IN THE LIGHT OF THE OUTCOME OF THE FORUM DELEGATION'S VISIT TO FRANCE.  COVERING ACTIONS AT THE BILATERAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL LEVEL. THESE MEASURES ARE IN LINE WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S CONSISTENT POLICY ON THIS ISSUE WHICH HAS BEEN TO RESPOND IN A MEASURED, GRADUATED WAY, LEAVING OPEN EVERY AVENUE FOR FRANCE TO RESPOND TO SOUTH PACIFIC CONCERNS.
<P>
THE FULL DETAILS OF THE PROPOSED MEASURES ARE SET OUT BELOW. IN BROAD OUTLINE, THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS:
<P>
- THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED THAT AUSTRALIA'S AMBASSADOR IN PARIS IS TO BE RECALLED FOR URGENT CONSULTATIONS AND BRIEFING ON HOW AUSTRALIA CAN BEST CONTINUE TO REACT TO THE FRENCH DECISION.
<P>
- THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO EXTEND THE CURTAILMENT OF DEFENCE CONTACTS WITH FRANCE IN THE AREAS OF SHIP AND AIRCRAFT VISITS, TRAINING, SENIOR OFFICER VISITS, MATERIAL ACQUISITION, AND DEFENCE-RELATED AGREEMENTS AND ARRANGEMENTS. THE SENIOR ADF REPRESENTATIVE IN PARIS WILL BE RECALLED. (IN RELATION TO THE CURTAILMENT OF AIRCRAFT VISITS, DEFENCE WILL TAKE THE OPERATIONAL STEPS REQUIRED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF MARITIME SURVEILLANCE TO THE PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES.)
<P>
- THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONVENE A SPECIAL MEETING OF SOUTH PACIFIC ENVIRONMENT MINISTERS TO DISCUSS THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF TESTING.
<P>
- THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE CONSULTING WITH FORUM COUNTRIES ON POSSIBLE REGIONAL MEASURES INCLUDING THE SUSPENSION OF FRANCE'S STATUS AS A SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM DIALOGUE PARTNER FOR THE DURATION OF TESTING, A POSSIBLE BOYCOTT BY INDIVIDUAL FORUM COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC GAMES TO BE HELD IN FRENCH POLYNESIA IN AUGUST, AND THE FORMATION OF A FORUM REGIONAL ACTION COMMITTEE TO COORDINATE RESPONSES TO FRANCE'S DECISION, MOBILISE AND SUPPORT COMMUNITY CAMPAIGNS IN FORUM COUNTRIES, AND REPORT TO THE MADANG FORUM IN SEPTEMBER.
<P>
- THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE CONSULTING WITH FORUM COUNTRIES ON THE DESIRABILITY OF A PUBLIC INFORMATION CAMPAIGN BEING MOBILISED IN FRANCE TO SENSITISE PUBLIC OPINION TO THE STRENGTH OF REGIONAL OPPOSITION TO FRENCH TESTING AND THE REASONS FOR IT.
<P>
- AT A WIDER INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, AUSTRALIAN DELEGATIONS AND REPRESENTATIVES WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITIES TO REGISTER AUSTRALIAN AND REGIONAL OPPOSITION TO FRENCH TESTING IN THE UN AND ALL OTHER APPROPRIATE MULTILATERAL BODIES, INCLUDING WHERE APPROPRIATE THROUGH THE INITIATION OF RESOLUTIONS
<P>
- A HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS MISSION WILL BE SENT TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATES TO ARGUE THE CASE FOR AN ACCEPTABLY DRAFTED AND QUICKLY NEGOTIATED CTBT.
<P>
WHILE IT IS NOT PROPOSED TO EMBARK UPON ANY TRADE OR OTHER DIRECT ECONOMIC RESTRICTIONS, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE EXISTING POLICY OF ENTERING INTO NO NEW CONTRACTS FOR THE SALE OF URANIUM TO FRANCE UNTIL FRANCE ENTERS INTO A COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY WILL REMAIN IN FORCE.
<P>
THE GOVERNMENT WILL KEEP THE IMPLEMENTATION AND IMPACT OF THE ABOVE MEASURES UNDER CLOSE REVIEW IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. WE ARE DETERMINED TO DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY AND REASONABLY CAN TO ENSURE THAT FRANCE UNDERSTANDS THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF AUSTRALIAN AND SOUTH PACIFIC OPPOSITION TO ITS TEST RESUMPTION DECISION AND ACTS ACCORDINGLY.

<P>
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP ON HIROSHIMA DAY
<P>
HIROSHIMA DAY - 50 YEARS ON
<P>
WHEN AN ATOMIC BOMB WAS DROPPED ON HIROSHIMA FIFTY YEARS AGO THE WORLD WAS CHANGED FOREVER. WE HAD BEEN THROUGH THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE WAR IN HUMAN HISTORY. AT THE VERY MOMENT WE EMERGED INTO THE PEACE WE LEARNED THAT THERE WERE WEAPONS IN THE WORLD OF UNIMAGINABLE DESTRUCTIVE FORCE. WE ENTERED A COLD WAR AND WITH IT CAME THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR - WHICH, IT BECAME INCREASINGLY APPARENT, MEANT THE ANNIHILATION OF CIVILISATION.
<P>
WE WERE NOT THE FIRST GENERATION IN HISTORY TO LIVE IN FEAR OF THE END OF THE WORLD. BUT WE WERE THE FIRST TO HAVE PROOF THAT IT COULD HAPPEN. FROM WHAT WE KNEW OF HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI WE KNEW WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE. AND AS FIRST THE SOVIET UNION AND THEN OTHER COUNTRIES DEVELOPED WEAPONS, AND TESTED THEM, AND THE WEAPONS BECAME INFINITELY MORE POWERFUL THAN THE HIROSHIMA BOMB. THE THREAT GREW.
<P>
FOR HALF A CENTURY WE HAVE LIVED WITH THIS THREAT: THAT A MISCALCULATION OR A MOMENT OF MADNESS AMONG A HANDFUL OF MEN IN WASHINGTON AND MOSCOW MIGHT BRING AN END TO HUMAN LIFE.
<P>
TO SAY THAT THIS KNOWLEDGE HAS PROFOUNDLY CHANGED OUR THINKING IS TO UNDERSTATE THE CASE. THE MUSHROOM CLOUD HAS LIVED IN ALL OUR MINDS.  IT HAS PERVADED OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE FUTURE,ABOUT OUR CHILDREN, ABOUT HUMAN NATURE.
<P>
SO LONG AS THE COLD WAR CONTINUED, THE SHADOW OF NUCLEAR WAR GREW LARGER. NEW TECHNOLOGIES EMERGED TO MAKE WEAPONS AND THEIR DELIVERY SYSTEMS EVER MORE EFFICIENT AND DEADLY. WE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH TERMS LIKE MUTUAL ASSURED DESTRUCTION, BUT WE NEVER GOT USED TO THE IDEA.
<P>
THE COLD WAR LIMITED OUR OPTIONS, BUT MANY COUNTRIES DID WHAT THEY COULD TO MAKE THE WORLD SAFER. AUSTRALIA WAS AMONG THOSE COUNTRIES.  IN FACT, AT THE FOREFRONT OF THEM.
<P>
WE WORKED THROUGH INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS TO PERSUADE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO HEED THE DANGERS OF NUCLEAR COMPETITION AND PREVENT NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION AND REDUCE NUCLEAR STOCKPILES. WE CREATED A NEW POST - AN AMBASSADOR FOR DISARMAMENT. IN 1985 WE TOOK A LEADING ROLE IN DEVELOPING THE TREATY OF RAROTONGA WHICH ESTABLISHED THE SOUTH PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE ZONE. PROTOCOL 3 OF THAT TREATY PROHIBITS NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC.
<P>
THE END OF THE COLD WAR CAME AS AN UNEXPECTED AND PROMISING CODA TO THE CENTURY. IT PROMISED A WAY OUT OF THE NUCLEAR PRISON. FOR A MOMENT IT SEEMED POSSIBLE THAT WHAT WE HAD ASSUMED TO BE A PERMANENT FEATURE OF OUR LIVES MIGHT HAVE BEEN A TEMPORARY NlGHTMARE.
<P>
IT CREATED A GREAT OPPORTUNITY: BUT TO SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY THE TWO GREAT QUESTIONS OF NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION AND NUCLEAR TESTING HAD TO BE ADDRESSED.
<P>
AT AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN MAY THIS YEAR, IT WAS AGREED TO INDEFINITELY EXTEND AND STRENGTHEN THE OPERATION OF THE TREATY ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS (NPT). THE PURPOSE OF THE NPT IS TO PREVENT THE EMERGENCE OF NEW NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATES.  WITHOUT THE NPT IT IS LIKELY THAT MANY COUNTRIES WOULD HAVE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
<P>
IT WAS A KEY TO THE AGREEMENT THAT NON-NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATES WERE ASSURED THE NUCLEAR POWERS WOULD PLAY THEIR PART IN DIMINISHING THE NUCLEAR THREAT AND EXERCISE 'UTMOST RESTRAINT' IN TESTING WEAPONS BEFORE A COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY (CTBT) WAS AGREED.
<P>
A COMMITMENT TO CONCLUDE AN INTERNATIONALLY BINDING AND GENUINE (UNDERLINE ONE) CTBT NO LATER THAN THE END OF 1996 WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OUTCOMES OF THE NPT CONFERENCE IN MAY. THIS WOULD ACHIEVE A GOAL FOR WHICH AUSTRALIA, AMONG OTHER COUNTRIES, HAS LONG FOUGHT IN THE UNITED NATIONS.
<P>
AUSTRALIA PLAYED AN INFLUENTIAL ROLE AT THE MAY CONFERENCE. WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN THE WORK UNDERWAY TO COMPLETE THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND HAVE TABLED A DRAFT TEXT.  THE CONCLUSION OF THE CTBT SHOULD BRING A PERMANENT END TO NUCLEAR TESTING AND WILL BE A MAJOR BOOST TO THE CAUSE OF NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT AND NON-PROLIFERATION. IT IS A KEY POLICY AIM OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT.
<P>
THE BOTH ANNIVERSARY OF HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI - THE ONLY TIMES NUCLEAR WEAPONS HAVE BEEN USED IN WAR - IS AN APPROPRIATE MOMENT TO URGE ALL GOVERNMENTS TO REDOUBLE THEIR EFFORTS FOR THE COMPLETION OF A TEST BAN TREATY.
<P>
CONTINUED TESTING GIVES COMFORT TO WOULD-BE PROLIFERATORS AND SOURS THE ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH THE TREATY NEGOTIATIONS WILL TAKE PLACE.  AUSTRALIA CALLS ON ALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATES TO PUT AN IMMEDIATE END TO NUCLEAR TESTING.
<P>
WE HAVE MADE OUR POSITION ON THIS CLEAR TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE.
<P>
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RECENTLY SENT A HIGH-LEVEL DELEGATION TO THE NUCLEAR WEAPON STATES TO UNDERLINE OUR CONCERNS. I AM PLEASED THAT ALL FIVE NUCLEAR WEAPON STATES HAVE CONFIRMED THEIR COMMITMENT TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION TO THE CTBT IN THE AGREED TIME. WE INTEND TO HOLD THEM TO THIS.
<P>
IN ADDITION TO THE EFFORT FOR A CTBT, AUSTRALIA IS SUPPORTING ANOTHER MEASURE FLOWING FROM THE NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY CONFERENCE: THE IMMEDIATE NEGOTIATION OF A CONVENTION TO CEASE THE PRODUCTION OF FISSIONABLE MATERIAL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS OR OTHER NUCLEAR DEVICES.
<P>
THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO RESUME TESTING AT MURUROA CAUSED ANGER IN AUSTRALIA AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF CONCERN FOR THE PACIFIC ENVIRONMENT, BUT BECAUSE IT PUTS ALL THIS WORK AT RISK. IT PUTS AT RISK OUR HOPES FOR A POST COLD WAR WORLD WHICH DOES NOT HAVE THE NUCLEAR SHADOW HANGING OVER IT.
<P>
THE FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING PROGRAM IS A SYMPTOM (UNDERLINE ONE) OF THE WIDER PROBLEM - THE PROBLEM OF WHAT WE DO TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE 21ST CENTURY.
<P>
SINCE 23 JUNE WHEN I ANNOUNCED THE MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN TO BRING HOME TO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT THE EXTENT OF AUSTRALIAN CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR POLICY, WE HAVE CONTINUED TO BUILD COALITIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH SHARE. OUR VIEW OF THE TESTING PROGRAM
<P>
WE HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY PLEASED AT THE WAY MANY PEOPLE IN EUROPE, BOTH WITHIN GOVERNMENTS AND OUTSIDE, HAVE SPOKEN OUT AGAINST THE FRENCH DECISION. SIMILARLY WELCOME EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN HAVE BEEN MADE BY JAPAN, BY OUR ASEAN NEIGHBOURS AND BY THE COUNTRIES OF LATIN AMERICA.
<P>
A CENTRAL AIM OF OUR POLICY IS TO WORK WITH THIS INTERNATIONAL COALITION, NOT ONLY IN OUR OPPOSITION TO FRENCH TESTS BUT ALSO ON WIDER NUCLEAR ISSUES.
<P>
THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM REGIONAL ACTION COMMITTEE HAS BEGUN ITS WORK.  AN IMPORTANT MEETING OF ENVIRONMENT MINISTERS FROM THE FIFTEEN SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM COUNTRIES WILL BE HELD IN BRISBANE ON 16 AND 17 AUGUST TO DISCUSS THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF TESTING.
<P>
AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED THAT AUSTRALIA WILL JOIN WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING JAPAN, IN BRINGING BEFORE THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR A COMPLETE AND IMMEDIATE END TO NUCLEAR TESTING.
<P>
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT PROGRESS TOWARDS A NUCLEAR WEAPONS-FREE WORLD MAY BE AIDED BY THE CREATION OF LINKAGES BETWEEN THE EXISTING OR POTENTIAL NUCLEAR-WEAPON FREE ZONES WHICH ALREADY COVER MOST OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE. WE WILL BE EXPLORING THIS WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE ZONE AND THE OTHER ZONES INVOLVED.
<P>
IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNICATION WITH THE GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLE OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, MANY OF WHOM SHARE OUR VIEWS, AND TO ENSURE THAT OUR POSITION IS FULLY UNDERSTOOD, I HAVE ASKED THE MINISTER FOR PACIFIC ISLAND AFFAIRS, THE HON GORDON BILNEY MP, TO LEAD A PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION TO EUROPE IN EARLY SEPTEMBER.  THIS WILL BE ADDITIONAL TO A DELEGATION, LED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE, SENATOR BEAHAN, WHICH WILL ALSO BE IN EUROPE MEETING MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT.
<P>
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CONSIDERING THE ISSUE OF WHETHER AUSTRALIA CAN TAKE ACTION IN THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE AGAINST THE FRENCH TESTS. AT PRESENT THE LEGAL ADVICE SUGGESTS THAT SUCH AVENUES ARE NOT OPEN TO US. WE WILL, HOWEVER, BE MAKING ORAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT ON THE ADVISORY OPINIONS SOUGHT BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION AND THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY ON THE LEGALITY OF USING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. AS THE FRENCH TESTS RAISE IMPORTANT ISSUES RELEVANT TO THESE PROCEEDINGS OUR POSlTlON WILL BE FIRMLY ON THE RECORD BEFORE THE COURT.
<P>
THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF CALLS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO SEND A SHIP TO MURUROA ATOLL AS PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL PROTEST AGAINST THE TESTING PROGRAM.
<P>
I HAVE PREVIOUSLY RULED OUT SENDING A NAVAL VESSEL. THE GOVERNMENT TAKES THE VIEW THAT NAVAL VESSELS SHOULD BE USED FOR NAVAL PURPOSES.
<P>
WE HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY OF SENDING A NON-NAVAL VESSEL. THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED AGAINST SUCH AN ACTION IN THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES. OUR REASONS ARE PRINCIPALLY STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL. IT WOULD BE A COSTLY EXERCISE AND IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT IT WOULD HAVE ANY PRACTICAL EFFECT. WE BELIEVE, ON BALANCE, THAT OUR RESOURCES CAN BE PUT TO BETTER USE DEVELOPING OTHER ELEMENTS OF OUR CAMPAIGN.
<P>
THE GOVERNMENT IS, HOWEVER CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF AUSTRALIAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE FLOTILLA. PRESENT INDICATIONS ARE THAT AROUND TEN AUSTRALIAN YACHTS COULD BE INVOLVED. THE AUSTRALIAN MARITIME SAFETY AUTHORITY, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE, WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH RELEVANT SOUTH PACIFIC SEARCH AND RESCUE AGENCIES TO OFFER ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IF THIS IS REQUIRED.
<P>
THE GOVERNMENT WILL STRENGTHEN CONSULAR SUPPORT FOR AUSTRALIANS IN FRENCH POLYNESIA.  
<P> 
WITH THE TRAGEDIES OF WORLD WAR 2 AND COLD WAR TENSION NOW BEHIND US, WE HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY GENERATIONS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REMAKE OUR CONCEPTS OF WORLD SECURITY AND TAKE POSITIVE STEPS TOWARDS A WORLD WITHOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
<P>
HIROSHIMA IS A MOST POWERFUL REMINDER THAT WE MUST NOT WASTE THAT OPPORTUNITY.
<P>
CANBERRA ISSUED 5 AUGUST 1995
<HR>
<P>
<B>STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER. THE HON P J KEATING, MP</B>
<P>
TESTING OP NUCLEAR WEAPONS BY CHINA
<p>
AUSTRALIA CONDEMNS THE LATEST TEST OP A NUCLEAR WEAPON BY CHINA.
<P>
THIS TEST IS THE SECOND IN ONLY THREE MONTHS SINCE THE EXTENSION OP THE TREATY ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS (NPT) IN MAY THIS YEAR. AT THE NPT REVIEW AND EXTENSION CONFERENCE ALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATES AGREED TO EXERCISE 'UTMOST RESTRAINT' WITH RESPECT TO NUCLEAR TESTING PENDING THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OP A COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY IN 1996, AND TO WORK SINCERELY TOWARDS THE ELIMINATION OP ALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS. CHINA'S ACTION FLIES IN THE FACE OP THESE UNDERTAKINGS, WHICH IT SUPPORTED AT THE NPT CONFERENCE.
<P>
ONE OF THE UNFORTUNATE CONSEQUENCES OP CHINA'S DECISION TO CONTINUE TESTING IS THAT NATIONS WHICH ASPIRE TO POSSESS NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL QUESTION THE SINCERITY OP NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATES TO EVENTUAL NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT AND THEIR INTEREST IN DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS MAY BE REINFORCED. SUCH A DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE A SERIOUS THREAT TO WORLD PEACE.
<P>
AUSTRALIA WELCOMES THE RECENT STATEMENT OF THE ASEAN REGIONAL FORUM, WHICH CALLED ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATES TO BRING AN IMMEDIATE END TO NUCLEAR TESTING, AS A CLEAR EXPRESSION OP REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE CONTINUED AND UNWARRANTED TESTING OP NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
<P>
AUSTRALIANS ARE ANGRY THAT DESPITE THE END OP THE COLD WAR AND THE SUCCESSFUL EXTENSION OP THE NPT BOTH CHINA AND FRANCE HAVE DECIDED TO CONTINUE TESTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. OUR DISAPPOINTMENT IS THE GREATER BECAUSE OP THE RESTRAINT EXHIBITED BY THE OTHER NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATES AND THE FACT THAT THESE WEAPONS TESTING PROGRAMS ARE OCCURRING AT A CRITICAL TIME IN INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS ON A NUMBER OP NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION AND DISARMAMENT INITIATIVES.
<P>
AUSTRALIA URGES CHINA TO CEASE ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS TESTING PROGRAM NOW AS BOTH AN IMPORTANT BOOST TO GLOBAL NON-PROLIFERATION AND DISARMAMENT EFFORTS AND GLOBAL SECURITY.

THE PHILIPPINES STRONGLY DEPLORES THE TEST OF A NUCLEAR DEVICE WHICH CHINA CONDUCTED YESTERDAY.
<P>
THE TEST WAS THE SECOND THAT CHINA HAD CONDUCTED SINCE THE REVIEW CONFERENCE OF THE NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY (NPT) IN APRIL THIS YEAR. IT MANIFESTLY VIOLATED THE UNDERSTANDING THAT HAD PREVAILED AT THE NPT REVIEW CONFERENCE THAT ALL NUCLEAR-WEAPONS STATES WOULD EXERCISE UTMOST RESTRAINT WITH RESPECT TO NUCLEAR TESTING PENDING THE CONCLUSION OF A COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY IN 1996.
<P>
CHINA'S DECISION TO CONTINUE TESTING FLIES IN THE FACE OF THE STATEMENT BY THE ASEAN REGIONAL FORUM EARLIER THIS MONTH, WHICH CALLED ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATES TO BRING AN IMMEDIATE END TO NUCLEAR TESTING.
<P>
THE PHILIPPINES URGES CHINA, AS WELL AS FRANCE, TO ABANDON PLANS FOR FURTHER NUCLEAR TESTS, WHICH HAVE RAISED SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE SINCERITY OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATES, AND DETER DISARMAMENT INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THE CONCLUSION OF A TEST BAN TREATY.
<P>
THE PHILIPPINES HAS CONSISTENTLY TAKEN AN ACTIVE STAND ON ISSUES RELATING TO NUCLEAR TESTING. FOLLOWING CHINA'S PREVIOUS TEST AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY FRANCE OF ITS PLANS TO RESUME TESTS IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC, WE HAVE, IN OUR CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE GROUP OF 77, INITIATED RESOLUTIONS IN MULTI- LATERAL FORA, INCLUDING THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY, CALLING FOR AN END TO NUCLEAR TESTS AND FOR STRICT ADHERENCE TO UNDERSTANDINGS REACHED IN THE REVIEW CONFERENCE. WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN PUSHING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SOUTHEAST ASIA NUCLEAR WEAPONS FREE ZONE.

LATEST TEST OF A NUCLEAR WEAPON BY CHINA
<P>
AS CURRENT CHAIR OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM, ON BEHALF OF MY FORUM COLLEAGUES I CONDEMN THE LATEST TEST OF A NUCLEAR WEAPON BY CHINA.
<P>
CHINA HAS ONCE AGAIN SHOWN DISREGARD FOR INTERNATIONAL OPPOSITION TO NUCLEAR TESTING BY CARRYING OUT ITS SECOND TEST SINCE THE INDEFINITE EXTENSION OF THE TREATY ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN MAY 199S 
<P> 
CHINA AND OTHER NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATES MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THE IMMINENT BAN ON NUCLEAR TESTING FOR ALL TIME. THEY MUST CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGED GLOBAL SECURITY SITUATION ON THE ROLE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
<P>
FORUM LEADERS WELCOME THE CONTINUATION BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RUSSIA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OF THEIR MORATORIUMS ON NUCLEAR TESTING, AS WELL AS THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE USA AND FRANCE OF THEIR COMMITMENT TO A TRULY COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY (CTBT). THESE ARE A SIGNIFICANT BOOST TO CURRENT NEGOTIATIONS FOR A CTBT. FORUM LEADERS REITERATE THEIR STRONG SUPPORT FOR FINALISATION AND SIGNATURE OF THE TREATY IN 1996.
<P>
WE LOOK TO CHINA AND FRANCE TO DESIST FROM FURTHER TESTING AS THE CTBT NEGOTIATIONS ENTER THIS FINAL, CRITICAL STAGE. THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENT HAVE NOTED CHINA'S COMMITMENT TO SIGN SUCH A TREATY.  FRANCE HAS GIVEN A SIMILAR COMMITMENT. THE CURRENT NUCLEAR TESTING PROGRAMS OF THESE TWO COUNTRIES ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THEIR COMMITMENT TO EXERCISE 'UTMOST RESTRAINT' ON NUCLEAR TESTING PENDING, THE CONCLUSION OF A CTBT, AND WILL SOUR THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS.
<P>
FORUM COUNTRIES, ALONG WITH OTHERS, ARE CONSIDERING A SUITABLE RESOLUTION TO BE PUT BEFORE THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO PRESSURE CHINA AND FRANCE TO RECONSIDER THEIR TESTING PROGRAMS.  ADDITIONALLY, FORUM MEMBERS WILL BE CONSIDERING ACTION IN OTHER INTERNATIONAL FORUMS TO MAKE OUR OPPOSITION KNOWN AND TO PRESS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO STOP TESTING.
<P>
NUCLEAR WEAPONS HAVE CAST A GREAT SHADOW OVER HUMANITY IN THIS PAST HALF CENTURY. SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM HEADS OF GOVERNMENT CALL ON CHINA TO CONTRIBUTE TO WORLD PEACE BY ELIMINATING THE TESTING OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THEREBY TAKING ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT STEP ON THE JOURNEY TO THE EVENTUAL ELIMINATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING: SPEMM DECLARATION<BR>
DECLARATION BY SOUTH PACIFIC ENVIRONMENT MINISTERS ON NUCLEAR TESTING
</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<P>
IN VIEW OF THE WIDESPREAD CONCERN AND PROTEST AT THE DECISION OF THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE TO RESUME FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC, FOURTEEN ENVIRONMENT MINISTERS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF SOUTH PACIFIC NATIONS MET IN BRISBANE FROM 16 TO 17 AUGUST 1995.
<P>
THE MINISTERS RECALLED THE LONG AND CONSISTENT OPPOSITION OF ALL COUNTRIES REPRESENTED TO NUCLEAR TESTING AND TO THE DUMPING OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE IN THE PACIFIC AS EXPRESSED IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM COMMUNIQUÉS AND DECLARATIONS, THE 1985 SOUTH PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE ZONE (SPNFZ) TREATY, THE 1986 CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC REGION (THE SPREP CONVENTION) AND THE PROPOSED WAIGANI CONVENTION TO BAN THE IMPORTATION INTO FORUM ISLAND COUNTRIES OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES AND TO CONTROL THE TRANSBOUNDARY MOVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTES WITHIN THE SOUTH PACIFIC REGION. THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THE OBLIGATIONS SET DOWN IN THE UN CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA WHICH REQUIRE STATES TO TAKE ALL MEASURES NECESSARY TO ENSURE THEIR ACTIVITIES DO NOT CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT OF OTHER STATES OR OF AREAS BEYOND THE LIMITS OF NATIONAL JURISDICTION.  THEY ALSO REAFFIRMED THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RIO DECLARATION, INCLUDING THE PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH WHICH PROVIDES THAT LACK OF FULL SCIENTlFlC CERTAINTY SHOULD NOT PROVIDE JUSTIFICATION FOR ACTIVITIES WHICH MAY CAUSE SERIOUS OR IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT.
<P>
THE MINISTERS RECALLED THE COMMITMENT OF ALL NUCLEAR WEAPON STATES IN THE DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES ADOPTED AT THE NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY REVIEW AND EXTENSION CONFERENCE ON 11 MAY 1995 TO EXERCISE THE "UTMOST RESTRAINT" IN NUCLEAR TESTING PENDING THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF A COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY (CTBT)). THE MINISTERS AGREED THAT CHINA'S CONTINUED NUCLEAR TESTING AND FRANCE'S DECISION TO RESUME NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE AREA OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE ZONE COULD IN NO WAY BE INTERPRETED AS CONSISTENT WITH THE PLEDGE TO EXERCISE "UTMOST RESTRAINT" IN NUCLEAR TESTING. THEY ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT FURTHER NUCLEAR TESTS COULD JEOPARDISE THE EARLY AND SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATION OF AN EFFECTIVE CTBT.
<P>
THE MINISTERS ASKED, IF THERE ARE NO ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL OR HEALTH IMPACTS AS THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT CLAIMS, WHY ARE FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTS CONDUCTED IN A TERRITORY FAR DISTANT FROM METROPOLITAN FRANCE? THEY AGREED THAT PAST INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS AND REPORTS (INCLUDING THOSE OF THE 1982 TAZIEFF MISSION, THE 1983 ATKINSON MISSION AND THE 1987 COUSTEAU MISSION), HAVE NOT RESOLVED THE QUESTION OF THE ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, ESPECIALLY THE LONG-TERM LEGACY, OF FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING. THE MINISTERS ALSO NOTED THE FAILURE OF FRANCE TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ALL FRENCH SCIENTIFIC DATA, SAMPLES AND STUDIES SO AS TO ENABLE AN INDEPENDENT AND COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH IMPACTS OF FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC AND TO GIVE A FIRM AND UNEQUIVOCAL COMMITMENT TO: 
<P> 
SIGN AND RATIFY THE PROTOCOLS OF THE SPNFZ TREATY;
<P>
CLOSE ITS NUCLEAR AND MILITARY FACILITIES AT MURUROA AND FANGATAUFA, WITH THE SOLE EXCEPTION OF SUCH FACILITIES AS ARE REOUIRED FOR FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING..
<P>
MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ALL FRENCH SCIENTIFIC DATA AND STUDIES SO AS TO ENABLE AN INDEPENDENT AND COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE SHORT AND LONG TERM ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH EFFECTS OF NUCLEAR TESTING AT MURUROA AND FANGATAUFA ATOLLS, AND ON THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE ATOLLS;
<P>
GUARANTEE FREE AND UNFETTERED ACCESS FOR INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC EXPERTS TO VISIT MURUROA AND FANGATAUFA ATOLLS, BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER ANY FURTHER TESTS, TO UNDERTAKE A COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH IMPACTS OF FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING;
<P>
ACKNOWLEDGE AND ABIDE BY THE PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH ENSHRINED IN THE RIO DECLARATION AND ACCEPT THE APPLICATION OF THAT DECLARATION'S PRINCIPLES TO ITS PROPOSED RESUMPTION OF NUCLEAR TESTING.
<P>
COMPLY WITH ITS INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE 1986 SPREP CONVENTION AND THE UN CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA TO CONDUCT A PRIOR ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF ANY MAJOR PROJECT SUCH AS NUCLEAR TESTING ON THE MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL AND TO INFORM STATES WHICH MAY BE AFFECTED AND TO CONSULT WITH THEM AS APPROPRIATE; AND
<P>
UNDERTAKE LONG-TERM ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AT MURUROA AND FANGATAUFA, THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF WHICH SHOULD BE OPEN TO INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC SCRUTINY, INCLUDING CONTINUING INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC ACCESS TO THE ATOLLS.
<P>
MINISTERS AGREED THAT SENATOR FAULKNER, AS CHAIRMAN OF THE MEETING, BRING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR FURTHER INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS AS SET OUT IN THE SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY GROUP PAPER TO THE ATTENTION OF THE FRENCH MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT. PARTICIPANTS ALSO ASKED MR BILNEY TO BRING THEIR CONCERNS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE FRENCH AND OTHER EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS ON HIS FORTHCOMING PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION TO EUROPE.
<P>
THE MINISTERS EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT FOR NEW ZEALAND'S DECISION TO SEEK TO REOPEN ITS 1973 INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE CASE AGAINST FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC.  
<P> 
A CHALLENGE TO PRESIDENT CHIRAC
<P>
FINALLY, THE MINISTERS CALLED ON PRESIDENT CHIRAC, AS A DEMONSTRATION OF FRANCE'S STATED COMMITMENT TO ACT AS A RESPONSIBLE AND CONSTRUCTIVE PARTNER IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC, TO DECLARE BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS FULL AND EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITY, INCLUDING FOR SUCH REMEDIATION OR COMPENSATION AS MAY BE NECESSARY, FOR ANY ADVERSE IMPACTS, PAST, PRESENT OR FUTURE, FROM FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH OF THE PEOPLES OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC.
<P>
THE SOUTH PACIFIC ENVIRONMENT MINISTERS MEETING FURTHER RECOMMENDED THAT SOUTH PACIFIC GOVERNMENTS AND THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM PURSUE THESE OBJECTIVES THROUGH ALL APPROPRIATE MEANS, INCLUDING THROUGH RAISING THEM IN INTERNATIONAL FORUMS.

STATEMENT BY THE SPOKESMAN OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
</STRONG>
<P>
(on 17 August 1995)
<P>
China has all along exercised utmost restraint on nuclear testing and the tests it has conducted are extremely limited in number. China stands for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. Its possession of a small number of nuclear weapons is solely for the purpose of self-defense and poses no threat to any other country.  China has unilaterally undertaken not to be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances and not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against any non-nuclear-weapon State or nuclear-weapon-free zone. Meanwhile, China strongly calls upon other nuclear-weapon States to respond positively to China's initiative by starting negotiations immediately with a view to concluding a treaty on mutual non- first-use of nuclear weapons and an agreement on non-use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States and nuclear-weapon-free zones. China has taken an active part in the negotiation on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty hoping to see this treaty concluded no later than 1996.  Once the treaty enters into force, China will stop nuclear tests.

AS CURRENT CHAIR OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM, ON BEHALF OF MY FORUM COLLEAGUES, I CONDEMN THE TEST OF A NUCLEAR WEAPON BY FRANCE IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC.
<P>
FRANCE HAS DEFIED THE WISHES OF THE PEOPLE OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC, THE APPEAL BY THE ASIAN NATIONS AS EXPRESSED IN THE RECENT ASEAN ReEGIONAL FORUM STATEMENT THAT CALLED ON THE NUCLEAR WEAPON STATES TO BRING AN IMMEDIATE END TO TESTING, AND THE VOICE OF AN INCREASING PART OF THE EUROPEAN AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THE MAJORITY OF THE FRENCH PEOPLE ALSO OPPOSE FRANCE'S TESTING PROGRAM IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC.
<P>       
OF PARTICULAR CONCERN TO THE COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC IS THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT'S RELUCTANCE TO FULLY ADDRESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH RISKS POSED BY THE TESTING.
<P>
FORUM LEADERS REITERATE THE CALLS MADE BY SOUTH PACIFIC ENVIRONMENT MINISTERS IN BRISBANE ON 17 AUGUST FOR;
<P>
AN IMMEDIATE END TO TESTING OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC AND THE CLOSING OF ASSOCIATED FACILITIES, EXCEPT THOSE REQUIRED FOR FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORIN;
<P>
FRANCE TO ACCEPT FULL AND EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR AN ADVERSE IMPACTS FROM FRENCH TESTING ON THE SOUTH PACIFIC ENVIRONMENT AND PEOPLE; AND FRANCE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ALL FRENCH SCIENTIFIC DATA AND TO THE TESTING SITES THEMSELVES TO ENABLE AN INDEPENDENT AND COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTS OF TESTING.
<P>
FORUM COUNTRIES CALL ON THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WEIGHT OF OPINION AGAINST NUCLEAR TESTING AND ABANDON IMMEDIATELY ITS TESTING IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC.

<B>THE FIRST FRENCH NUCLEAR TEST</B>

THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT UTTERLY CONDEMNS FRANCE'S NUCLEAR EXPLOSION AT MURUROA.

BY ITS ACTIONS THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT EXPRESSES ITS CONTEMPT FOR THE COUNTRIES AND PEOPLE OF THE REGION, AND FOR ALL THOSE WHO HOPE AND WORK FOR A NUCLEAR FREE WORLD.
<P>
WHATEVER THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT HAD IN MIND BY CONDUCTING THIS TEST, IT HAS DONE NOTHING TO ENHANCE THE HONOUR OF FRANCE, AND HAS SEVERELY DAMAGED ITS INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION.
<P>
AUSTRALIA WILL BE PROTESTING IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS TO FRANCE, AND PRESSING AHEAD VIGOROUSLY WITH OUR COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM OF ACTION AIMED AT CONVINCING THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT TO DESIST FROM FURTHER TESTS.
<P>
I HAVE ASKED THE MINISTER FOR PACIFIC ISLAND AFFAIRS, MR BILNEY, TO CONVEY OUR PROTEST DIRECTLY TO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT DURING HIS VISIT TO PARIS LATER THIS WEEK AS LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION ON NUCLEAR TESTS.
<P>
AS I HAVE SAID, OUR PROTESTS WILL NOT END WITH THE FIRST TEST. UNTIL THE TESTS STOP, WE WILL CONTINUE TO REMIND THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT THAT WITH EVERY TEST THEY CONDUCT, THE GOOD NAME OF FRANCE IS DIMINISHED IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD.
<P>
I NOTE REPORTS THAT PRESIDENT CHIRAC HAS SUGGESTED THE NUMBER OF TESTS AT MURUROA MAY BE FEWER THAN ORIGINALLY ANNOUNCED. THIS APPARENT RESPONSE TO INTERNATIONAL PROTESTS WILL NOT DIMINISH OUR OPPOSITION TO EACH AND EVERY NUCLEAR TEST IN THE PACIFIC. WE DO NOT WANT FEWER TESTS: WE WANT NO TESTS.

14. The Foreign Ministers emphasised the importance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in promoting international peace and security. Bearing in mind the objectives of general and complete disarmament, the Foreign Ministers noted the outcome of the recent 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the NPT and attached particular importance to the establishment of internationally recognised nuclear-weapon-free zones by the year 2000. In this regard, the Foreign Ministers deplored the resumption or planned resumption of nuclear tests in the Asia Pacific in view of the commitment of all State Parties to the NPT to exert utmost restraint on nuclear weapons testing and to conclude the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996.  They also called on all nuclear weapons states to desist from testing nuclear devices.

Statement of H.E. President Fidel V. Ramos on the Nuclear Test by France
</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
I am profoundly disappointed by the news that France, in utter disregard of the concern expressed by many countries and ignoring the appeals of the countries that stand to be directly affected by its action, proceeded with its first nuclear test at the Mururoa Atoll.
<P>
France has dealt a serious blow to the cause of nuclear disarmament and has severely damaged the credibility of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which was extended indefinitely last May.
<P>         
The Philippines is committed to nuclear disarmament and is firmly opposed to the conduct of any nuclear tests, conscious of the serious medium and long-term environmental and human costs. I have repeatedly appealed to President Chirac to reconsider and cancel the planned tests. I am deeply saddened that he has not heeded my, and other leaders' appeal.
<P>         
France served as a beacon when it led other nuclear weapons States in observing the moratorium on nuclear testing. Now, France has deeply disillusioned the international community by turning its back on its previous restraint and proceeding with the tests.
<P>
The Philippines will sustain its initiatives in leading the Group of 77 at international and regional fora to protest nuclear testing by any nation. We again call on France to respect international opinion and heed the concerns expressed by countries in the Pacific Rim, which are most vulnerable to such tests by altogether canceling the remaining tests.

Communication of 6 September 1995 Received from the Permanent Mission of Belarus to the International Atomic Energy Agency

<P>
<HR>
<P>
The texts of a letter dated 6 September 1995 and of a Memorandum attached thereto which the Director General has received from the Permanent Mission of Belarus are - as requested - reproduced for the attention of the General Conference.
<P>
"I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Waller's letter of 27 July 1995 and your fax of 5 September 1995 concerning our unpaid contributions to the IAEA Regular Budget and the Working Capital Fund and possible suspension of our voting rights at the thirty-ninth IAEA General Conference.
<P>
"I want to tell you frankly that recently this alarming problem was considered very seriously by my Government. Despite the present extremely grave financial and economic difficulties of the Republic of Belarus my Government found the possibility to allocate only 100.000 US dollars to cover a part of our arrears to the Agency. This amount will be transferred to the Agency soon. It is a sign of my Government's willingness to fulfil its obligations before the Agency as soon as circumstances permit. Unfortunately now my Government is not in a position to pay the whole amount of 627.940 US dollars by the opening of the IAEA General Conference.
<P>
 "I am forwarding to you herewith a Memorandum of my Government explaining our very difficult financial situation and requesting the General Conference to take into consideration the circumstances and to allow our delegation to vote at the 39th IAEA General Conference. I kindly ask you to issue this Memorandum as an official document of the General Conference."(1)

Memorandum
</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
"On the subject of the unpaid contributions of the Republic of Belarus to the IAEA's budget the Government of Belarus has the honour to make the following statement.
<P>
"The 1986 accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant caused irreparable damage to the economy of Belarus. Twenty-three per cent of the Republic's total area and up to forty per cent of its farmland were put out of normal use. More than one hundred thousand people were resettled in cleaner areas.  People's health suffered irreparable harm. In recent years there has been a sharp rise in the incidence of thyroid cancer among children, and experts predict a further increase in this dreadful disease. The State's direct and indirect annual expenditure on mitigating the consequences of the Chernobyl accident amounts to 20% of the national budget. Scientists estimate that at this rate of expenditure the Republic will need another 160 years to repair the damage. In this connection, it must be pointed out that Belarus had nothing to do with the causes of the accident, nor was the exploded reactor located on its territory.
<P>
"Belarus's economic difficulties, including those stemming from the Chernobyl disaster, have increased substantially since the break-up of the USSR. The process of economic re-structuring of Belarus, the lessening of its dependence on external markets for its energy and raw material needs, the creation of a competitive export potential - all this will take a long time and require vast external sources of funds.
<P>
"A heavy burden has been imposed on Belarus by the costs of destroying military hardware in accordance with the Treaty on the Reduction of Conventional Forces in Europe and by the costs of dismantling nuclear weapons and transferring them outside the borders of Belarus under the START Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol.
<P>
"Becoming a party to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon State, concluding a safeguards agreement with the IAEA and establishing a costly State system of nuclear material accounting, control and physical protection are involving the Belarus Government in considerable expenditure.
<P>
"The cumulative effect of all these factors on the Republic's economy has led to a sharp decline in the country's ability to pay in real terms. Its negative foreign trade balance for the first five months of 1995 alone was US $270 million. At the end of 1994 Belarus's external debt was US $2000 million.
<P>
"The difficult economic situation of Belarus was aggravated further by the unjust and legally unjustifiable decision taken by the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-seventh session to increase Belarus's assessment for the Regular Budget for 1993 and 1994 by a factor of one and a half. The General Assembly decision was followed by an automatic increase in the country's assessments for the regular budgets of the UN Specialized Agencies, including the IAEA.
<P>
"In 1994, taking into account the situation prevailing in Belarus, the United Nations fixed a new rate of assessment for Belarus for 1995-97, reducing its contribution substantially from 0.48% to 0.28%. However, its contribution to the IAEA's 1995 budget has been calculated without regard to the United Nations revised scale. Furthermore, during the years when the USSR was still in existence Belarus was placed in the category of unshielded States for calculation of its contribution to the Agency's safeguards budget.
<P>
"The current minimum wage in the Republic is US $5 per month and the average monthly earnings stand at US $40. Nevertheless, the Republic still continues to be classified among the most developed countries, in which the per capita national income is much higher than in Belarus and with whose nuclear activities those of Belarus bear no comparison - it does not have a single nuclear power plant, nor a single operating reactor within its borders.  Attention was also drawn to the existing unfairness in the report submitted at the June (1995) meetings of the Board of Governors by the IAEA's informal working group on the financing of safeguards, which recommended transferring Belarus to the group of "shielded" States.
<P>
"Since the Agency's inception Belarus has always scrupulously honoured its financial obligations to the IAEA. It is only the extremely difficult economic situation in which Belarus has found itself in recent years for reasons beyond its control, as well as the disregard, in the case of Belarus, for the principle that a State's contribution should match its real ability to pay, that has resulted in the Republic's being in arrears with its contributions to the Agency. On the eve of the present session of the General Conference the Government of the Republic of Belarus transferred US $100 000 to the Agency in part payment of its arrears, and it will make every effort to meet in full its financial obligations to the Agency as soon as the situation permits.
<P>
"The Government of the Republic of Belarus appeals to the delegations of Member States at the thirty-ninth session of the General Conference of the IAEA to give favourable consideration to this matter in the light of the foregoing and to recognize that Belarus's failure to pay is due to circumstances beyond its control."
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<I>(1) It is suggested that, pursuant to Rule 42(b) of the Conference's Rules of Procedure and in line with past practice, this request be referred to the General Committee for consideration.</I>

<H3>Specimen Draft Resolution</H3>
<BR>
<B>on the Regular Budget appropriations for 1996 at the September 1995 dollar/schilling exchange rate</B>

Note by the Secretariat

<P>
1.  Document GC(39)/4-- "The Agency's Budget for 1996" - contains, in <A HREF=gc394.html>Annex VI, draft resolution A</A> relating to the Regular Budget appropriations for 1996.  Attached to this draft resolution is an adjustment formula, approved by the Board of Governors, for taking into account fluctuations in the United States dollar/Austrian schilling exchange rate. With this adjustment formula, the adopted resolution on the Regular Budget becomes self-adjusting. The exchange rate used in document GC(39)/4 for presenting the 1996 budget estimates is AS 12.70 to US $1.00.
<P>         
2. In order to illustrate how the adjustment formula operates and to give the General Conference the Regular Budget appropriation figures on the basis of the most up-to-date dollar/schilling exchange rate, draft resolution A is reproduced in the Annex hereto on the basis of a rate of AS 10.30 to $1.00, the United Nations operational rate for September 1995.[1]
<P>         
3. The adjustment formula has two components the sum of which gives the appropriations in United States dollars. One component is fixed in terms of United States dollars and the other varies according to the value of the parameter R. R corresponds to the average of the United Nations operational dollar/schilling exchange rates that will be experienced during 1996. This average exchange rate will determine the final dollar figures for the appropriation sections.
<P>         
4. The attached SPECIMEN draft resolution gives the amounts by appropriation section on the assumption that the average of the United Nations operational dollar/schilling exchange rates experienced in 1996 will be 10.30 (i.e. 10.30 Austrian schillings for one United States dollar). By dividing by 10.30 the figures in the right-hand column of the adjustment formula (which reflect expenditures budgeted in Austrian schillings) and adding the result to the figures in the left-hand column, one obtains total appropriations for 1996 of $260 876 000, as shown in paragraph 1 of the SPECIMEN draft resolution.
<P>
5. As indicated in paragraph 2 above, the purpose of this information paper is illustrative. In submitting to the Conference the budget estimates for 1996 in document GC(39)/4, the Board of Governors requested - in paragraph 1 of the Introduction to that document - the General Conference to adopt the draft resolutions set forth in Annex VI.

<LI>Attached to this document is a note prepared by the Secretariat on negotiations in the Standing Committee on Liability for Nuclear Damage since the thirty-eighth regular session of the General Conference.
<P>
<LI>On 13 September 1995, the Board of Governors decided that this note should be transmitted, together with the summary records of its discussion on "Liability for nuclear damage", to the General Conference for its information.
<P>
<LI>The summary records of the Board's discussion will be issued as an Addendum to the present document.

<OL>                           
<LI>Over the past few years, the question of liability for nuclear damage has been under consideration both in the Board and in the General Conference, which has adopted a number of resolutions regarding it, in which the two policy-making organs underlined the need for establishing a comprehensive international liability regime.
<P>
<LI>In February 1990, the Board established the Standing Committee on Liability for Nuclear Damage with a mandate - in particular - to:
<P> 
(i) consider international liability for nuclear damage, including international civil liability, international State liability, and the relationship between international civil and State liability;
<P>
(ii) keep under review problems relating to the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and advise States party to the Convention on any such problems; and
<P> 
(iii) make the necessary substantive preparations and administrative arrangements for a revision conference to be convened in accordance with Article XXVI of the Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage.
<P> 
The Standing Committee reports to the Board periodically on the progress of its work.
<P>
<LI> Since the thirty-eighth (1994) regular session of the General Conference, the Standing Committee has held three sessions - the tenth (31 October - 4 November 1994), eleventh (20 - 24 March 1995) and twelfth (26 - 30 June 1995)<B>(1)</B> - during which efforts were intensifled with a view to expediting the preparatory work for the diplomatic conference. In the context of the integrated approach in dealing with all issues of its agenda, the Committee alternated between the examination of the revision of the Vienna Convention and the new texts on supplementary funding. It was recognized that agreement on fundamental issues of supplementary funding was crucial at the present stage for further progress in negotiations.
<P>
<LI>Further progress was made by resolving a number of outstanding issues in the proposed draft amendments to the Vienna Convention. In dealing with this item, the Standing Committee has moved closer to the conclusion of its task. Several questions of principle still remain to be settled, in particular, actual figures for the limits of compensation, geographic scope, the definition of nuclear damage, and the final clauses.
<P>
<LI>With respect to supplementary funding, the Standing Committee has considered two basic approaches under consideration on this issue. One is set out in the "collective State contributions" draft that is intended to operate on the basis of the legal framework of the Vienna and Paris Conventions and covers both transboundary and domestic nuclear damage.  The other approach is set out in the "umbrella" draft which is a free-standing instrument that may be adhered to irrespective of participation in the Vienna or the Paris Convention and is devoted exclusively to transboundary nuclear damage.
<P>
<LI>The Standing Committee, at its eleventh session, held detailed discussions of the fundamental issues involved in the above-mentioned draft conventions and of their relationship. The Standing Committee expressed strong preference for elaboration of a single draft instrument on supplementary funding by merging the "collective State contributions" draft and the "umbrella" draft. Only if this should not prove feasible, the Committee would submit to a diplomatic conference two mutually complementary and compatible drafts. At the same time, a number of delegations urged the Standing Committee to prepare only one draft instrument on supplementary funding for submission to the diplomatic conference.
<P>
<LI>Accordingly, the Standing Committee considered, at its twelfth session, the "merged" draft combining the "collective State contributions" and "umbrella" approaches, which was prepared at its request by an informal drafting meeting. The "merged" draft is intended to be a freestanding instrument compatible with the Vienna and Paris Conventions; it contains a so-called "grandfather clause" which also allows participation by a State that does not implement certain provisions of the convention, if it has legislation in force on 1 January 1995 providing for strict liability for substantial offsite nuclear damage and for economic channelling. The draft provides for two types of supplementary funding based on the "collective State contributions" and "umbrella" approaches respectively.
<P>
Also, the Standing Committee discussed a proposal by Denmark and Sweden for a single supplementary fund which would be split initially into two equal parts reserved for domestic and transboundary damage respectively. A time limit may be imposed for preferential treatment of claims for both types of damage, beyond which unused money reserved for one part of the fund would be used in its other part. In several respects this proposal is similar to the "merged" draft, e.g. freestanding character, grandfather clause.
<P>
<LI> No consensus with respect to supplementary funding was reached on the basis of either the "merged" text or the Danish-Swedish proposal. It was generally held that the two texts needed further consideration and elaboration with a view to enabling the thirteenth session to work out the text of a draft convention on the subject. The Secretariat was requested to convene an open-ended informal drafting meeting on 26 to 29 September to prepare, if feasible, a supplementary funding text or texts with a view to assisting the thirteenth session of the Standing Committee in the elaboration of a generally acceptable draft convention. The text or texts coming out as a result of this meeting should be distributed in all the working languages to the Member States.
<P>
<LI>It was recognized during the twelfth session of the Standing Committee that intensified preparations and further political guidance should be sought in order to achieve agreement. The Committee's next session will be held from 30 October to 3 November 1995.
<P>         
<LI> On the timing and preparation for the diplomatic conference, the Standing Committee, at its eleventh session in March 1995, agreed to recommend, with reservations by some delegations, that the diplomatic conference may be convened in Spring 1996 and that the administrative and organizational arrangements should be made commensurate with its programme. In this connection, the Standing Committee foresees that the diplomatic conference may be devoted to the revision of the Vienna Convention and supplementary funding.
<P>
<LI>The Standing Committee will report to the Board when the preparatory work has been completed so that a decision concerning the holding of the diplomatic conference, its duration and date may then be taken. The draft budget estimates for 1996 have so far envisaged funds for a conference of one week duration.

</CENTER>         
<P>
I move that this House:
<P>
Deploring the recent announcement by President Chirac that France intends to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific, thereby breaking the moratorium observed since 1992;       
<P>
Recognizing New Zealand's responsibility as a non-nuclear weapons  state  under the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and as a member of the United Nations;
<P>
Recalling  New  Zealand's  status  as  a  nuclear-free Zone established by law in 1987,  and the South Pacific nuclear Free Zone established by the Treaty of Rarotonga in 1985;
<P>
Recalling that France, China, and the other nuclear weapons states  undertook  during  the  NPT  Review  and Extension Conference to exercise utmost restraint on nuclear testing, and to sign a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) no later than 1996,  and their obligation under the NPT to negotiate nuclear disarmament in good faith;
<P>         
Recalling that it is 50 years since the first nuclear weapons were used in war at Hiroshima and Nagasaki;
<P>
Believing   that   the   designing,   production,  testing, possession,  deployment and possible use of nuclear weapons constitute threats to the right  to  life,  and to a clean environment  for current and future generations and for all species;
<P>
Recalling the judgement of the International Court of Justice in 1914 with regard to nuclear testing;
<P>
Recalling  also  the  sabotage  and  sinking  of  the "Rainbow Warrior",  and the  killing of  Fernando  Pereira  by French Government  agents  10  years ago  in order to prevent that vessel making a voyage of protest and witness to  the French nuclear testing zone;
<P>
Noting that France's decision to resume nuclear testing, and the  continuation of testing by China,  may jeopardise the negotiations  now underway  on  the  conclusion  of  a truly comprehensive and internationally-verifiable nuclear test ban treaty;
<P>
Noting  also  that France's decision runs counter to strongly-held  views  in  South  Pacific  countries  and has aroused a storm of protest around the world;
<P>
Noting regional concern that the planned resumption of testing will put at risk the marine environment resources, way of life and health of the peoples of the South Pacific;
<P>
<B>Resolves</B> to send a delegation of New Zealand parliamentarians to discuss this issue with members of the European Parliament;
<P>
Calls on France and China to cancel their planned nuclear testing programmes, and for the closure for all time of all nuclear testing facilities;
<P>
Urges France and the other four nuclear weapons states to agree to a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which specifically prohibits all nuclear tests and experiments, including low and very low yield tests;
<P>
Calls on the nuclear weapons states to sign without delay a CTBT as the next step on the road towards complete nuclear disarmament, a CTBT being seen as an essential commitment by the nuclear weapons states towards preventing nuclear proliferation;
<P>
Calls on France, the United Kingdom and the United States of America to sign the protocols of  the Treaty of Rarotonga (South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty)  immediately, as a measure of good faith:
<P>
Calls on all countries in the Southern Hemisphere to conclude at an early date nuclear weapons-free zone treaties currently under negotiation;
<P>
Resolves to continue to raise the issue by all available legal and political means in all relevant international fora, particularly those of the United Nations;
<P>
Invites  France  and  China  to  recognize  the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice without reservation,  in respect of any matters concerning nuclear weapons;
<P>
Urges  all other parliaments  to  redouble their efforts to reach an early agreement on a truly comprehensive test ban treaty and move towards complete nuclear disarmament.

French Nuclear Test

"As a mark of New Zealand's outrage, l have today instructed that the New Zealand Ambassador in Paris, Mr Chris Beeby, is to be recalled to New Zealand immediately for consultations" the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Jim Bolger said today. He responding to reports of France's detonation of a nuclear device in French Polynesia, the first in a series of tests which the French President announced in June would be conducted over the next few months.
<P>         
"France is flying in the face of world opinion. Just a short time ago 18 nations of the Asia-Pacific region called for an immediate end to all nuclear testing. France has turned a blind eye to the storm of protest that its decision to resume nuclear testing has stirred up in recent weeks", the Prime Minister said.  "Opposition to the tests has come from around the globe including, significantly, from Europe itself. A majority of the French people say the policy is wrong. We live in an interdependent world. It defies explanation that the French Government sees itself as somehow standing apart."
<P>         
Mr Bolger noted with regret that by using its presence in the South Pacific to pursue its national defence policies, France was totally disregarding the views and interests of the states of the South Pacific. Its actions also ran counter to the worldwide movement away from nuclear weapons and greatly complicated the chances of the international community realising its broader goal of a truly comprehensive and internationally verifiable test ban treaty. "We have welcomed recent French Government statements that France could support a Treaty that prohibits any nuclear test explosion. It is a step in the right direction. But we also want France to close for all time the testing sites at Mururoa and Fangataufa and to sign the protocols to the Treaty of Rarotonga."
<P>         
"New Zealand is not prepared to stand idly by", the Prime Minister said. "Our prime objective up to this point has been to persuade President Chirac to rescind his decision to resume testing. We deeply regret his refusal to do so. We will press ahead with our appeal to the International Court of Justice for an interim injunction. I will be calling in the French Ambassador today to say that France's actions are unacceptable At my initiative, I am also having an article conveying my views on the French testing programme published in the next issue of the prestigious French daily <I>Le Monde.</I> The message will be that the French nuclear tests are quite simply wrong and the Government of France should stop them. It is time France woke up to the fact that its actions have caused deep concern and anger among Countries in this part of the world.  They have also caused deep disquiet in the wider international community."

Chinese Nuclear Test
</STRONG>
<P>
"I know that I speak for all New Zealanders in expressing serious concern and regret at China's action in proceeding with yet another nuclear test.  This is all the more reprehensible in the light of the current widespread protest at France's decision to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific", the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon J B Bolger, said today. He was responding to reports of another nuclear test explosion having been carried out today in China.
<P>
The Prime Minister went on to emphasise that New Zealand was against nuclear testing wherever it occurs and by wherever it is conducted. It was particularly disturbing, he said, that the explosion came shortly after 18 Asia/Pacific nations  had called for an immediate end to all nuclear testing in the region.
<P>
"Feelings in New Zealand are running high on this issue", Mr Bolger said. "It is important that the Chinese Government realises that it cannot simply go on testing its nuclear weapons while hoping that the international community will turn a blind eye. It should not think that the furor over France's intentions to proceed with a further series of tests at Mururoa has removed China from the spotlight. I myself have voiced our concerns direct to President Jiang Zemin. Don McKinnon did likewise when he met with his counterpart in Beijing last month".
<P>
"China's actions run counter to the move away from nuclear armaments and will further complicate the negotiation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. After its last nuclear test, the Chinese Government confirmed that it was committed to the Treaty and would stop testing once the Treaty has been concluded.  I urge the Chinese Government to show that it is serious about ensuring that the negotiations in Geneva are completed next year. In particular, we call upon China to announce its agreement to a zero threshold for testing and to withdraw its proposal to allow 'peaceful nuclear explosions'.
<P>
"Foreign Minister Don McKinnon will be conveying our serious concerns to the Chinese Ambassador when he calls him in to receive New Zealand's protest. Our Ambassador in Beijing has also been instructed to register our opposition at the highest possible level"

<LI>The Annual Report for 1994 of IAEA reports on three different environmental studies relating to the dumping of radioactive waste in open sea areas. One of them is a joint expedition on environmental radioactivity of the sea area surrounded by Japan, Korea and the Russian Federation. The Government of the Republic of Korea would like to raise a point with regard to the geographical name of the sea area in which the joint expedition was carried out by the three countries

<LI>The sea area lying between the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese Archipelago is known as "Sea of Japan" at present.  However, historically, in the Orient, the sea area in question was referred to as "East Sea", "Sea of Korea", "Sea of Japan", or "Oriental Sea", while in western maps, it was referred to as "Sea of Korea", "Sea of Japan" or "Oriental Sea". All in all, it is difficult to find that one name had been consistently used for designating this sea area.
<P>
<LI>A study of old maps reveals that the names "Sea of Korea" and "Sea of Japan" were used more often than others by cartographers. However, if we put together all instances where this sea had been named, from the beginning of the 1 8th century to the middle of the 19th century, it is found that "Sea of Korea" appeared on world maps more frequently than "Sea of  Japan".
<P>
<LI> It was Japanese colonialism that played the most critical role in spreading the usage of "Sea of Japan". In 1905, Japan deprived Korea of its right to engage in foreign relations and in 1910, annexed Korea through coercion. Thereafter, increased Japanese influence in the international scene including the 1926 Paris Conference of International  Hydrographic Organization led to the fixation of the use of the name "Sea of Japan".
<P>                                                      
<LI> The Republic of Korea believes that it is inappropriate to name a sea area after a single country when it is surrounded by several countries since it may give the wrong impression that the whole area belongs to that one country. In line with this belief, the Republic of Korea, following its  independence, decided to refer to the sea area in question as "East Sea" instead of "Sea of Korea", and has opposed the use of "Sea of Japan".  However, recognizing the reality that the name "Sea of Japan" is being used at present, the Republic of Korea has proposed that both the names "East Sea" and "Sea of Japan" be used simultaneously to designate the sea area in question until a mutually acceptable solution is found among the countries concerned.
<P>         
<LI> When concluding the Fisheries Agreement between Japan and the Republic of Korea in 1965, the two countries agreed that the name "Tonghae" (Korean word for "East Sea") be used in the Korean text of the Agreement while "Sea of Japan" be used in the Japanese text.

<P>                           
<LI> Although there does not exist an international body that has authority over names of geographical features beyond a single sovereignty, the United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names has consistently recommended that the countries having a dispute over the name of a shared geographical area should endeavour to seek an agreement through consultation. The Conference has further recommended that the names applied by each country be used  simultaneously in the absence of an agreement. Among the related resolutions adopted by the Conference, the resolution 111/20 best expresses the position of the Conference and reads as follows:
<P>
<B>The Conference</B>
<P>
<B>"Considering</B> the need for international standardization of names of geographical features that are under the sovereignty of more than one country or are divided among two or more countries,
<P>         
<OL>         
<B><LI>Recommends </B>that countries sharing a given geographical feature under different names should endeavour, as far as possible, to reach agreement on fixing a single name for the feature concerned;
<P>
<B><LI>Further recommends</B> that when countries sharing a given geographical feature do not succeed in agreeing on a common name, it should be a general rule of international cartography that the name used by each of the countries concerned will be accepted.  policy of accepting only one or some of such names while excluding the rest would be inconsistent in principle as well as inexpedient in practice. Only technical reasons may sometimes make it necessary, especially in the case of small-scale maps, to dispense with the use of certain names belonging to one language or another" 
</OL> 
<P>         
<LI> It should be noted that the Sixth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names held in New York in August I 992 made a suggestion to the parties concerned to consult each other when the Republic of Korea raised an issue with regard to the name of the sea in question.
<P>
<LI> At the First Intergovernmental Meeting on the Northwest Pacific Action Plan for the Protection, Management and Development of the Marine and Coastal Environment held among China, Japan, Republic of Korea, and the Russian Federation in Seoul in September 1994, the geographical coverage of the action plan was provisionally designated by its longitudinal and latitudinal position

<LI> In their preparations to carry out the joint expedition to investigate the situation of environmental radioactivity in the sea area surrounded by Japan, Korea, and the Russian Federation, a difference of opinion emerged between Japan and the Republic of Korea on the name of the sea where the expedition where the expedition was to take place. In consideration of the fact that such conflicting opinions should not come in the way of the implementation of the project, the three countries held two experts meetings while Japan and the Republic of Korea carried out separate consultations through diplomatic channels with the aim of resolving their differences. Following a series of consultations, the three countries reached an agreement in February 1994 at a conference held in Vladivostok where they decided on a <I>modus operandi</I> to use a third name, i.e. "far-eastern sea", to refer to the sea area in question.
<P>    
<LI> Following the completion of the first joint expedition, the three countries adopted the report titled, "Investigation of Environmental Radioactivity in Waste Dumping Areas of the Far Eastern Sea Areas -- 1994 Results from the First Korean-Japanese-Russian Joint Expedition" in July 1995.
<P>
<LI> In reporting the joint expedition of the three countries, the Annual Report for 1994 of IAEA states that the joint expedition was carried out in  the "Sea of Japan". This is not in conformity with the above-mentioned special agreement reached among the three countries. In this context, it is the firm position of the Government of the Republic of Korea that "Sea of Japan" should be replaced with "far-eastern sea" in accordance with the special agreement among the three countries involved.

MR. N.A. NAZARBAEV

<P>                           
September 1995
<P>         
Kazakhstan shares the concern of the world community and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, at the illicit trafficking in nuclear materials which is continuing despite the fact that the States-parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) have taken the decision to extend the Treaty indefinitely.
<P>    
The danger of proliferation is also heightened by the dismantling of large quantities of nuclear weapons, the activities of non-governmental bodies seeking to acquire nuclear devices and the risk of nuclear materials and weapons finding their way into regions where national and ethnic conflicts are taking place.
<P>
We support the efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve this problem. Now that Kazakhstan has ratified the agreement with the Agency for the application of safeguards in connection with the NPT, it has joined the international safeguards system for preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and their components.
<P>
However, technical measures alone are no panacea against nuclear proliferation, since the activities of non-governmental elements pose a very great threat on account of their covert nature. A new climate of openness and transparency in nuclear matters is necessary.  The effectiveness of the non-proliferation regime depends on a high level of political commitment to international security by governments, which must co-operate to establish a tougher system of export monitoring and control. In this connection the proposal by Boris Yeltsin, President of the Russian Federation, for a meeting in spring 1996 to discuss nuclear security could be an important step towards uniting forces against illicit trafficking in nuclear materials.

WRITTEN STATEMENT BY THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

</STRONG>                           
<P>                           
The Republic of Azerbaijan has no nuclear power plants or nuclear reactors.  However, providing radiation protection for the population and isolating people from the action of ionizing radiation are urgent problems for Azerbaijan.
<P>         
This is due largely to the fact that natural radiation background levels are increasing everywhere on earth as a consequence of human technological activities. However, the main threat of radioactive contamination of the environment in our region comes from the Medzamor nuclear power plant in neighbouring Armenia.
<P>         
This threat is due to its location in a seismic danger zone and also to the uncontrolled release of waste waters into a river flowing through the territory of Azerbaijan.
<P>         
This nuclear power plant, of the same type as the one at Chernobyl, is dangerous.  Prolonged mothballing has aggravated the threat posed by its operation. Starting up the Medzamor nuclear power plant will inevitably have a negative influence on the ecological situation not only in Azerbaijan, but throughout the region. The probability of an accident at the power plant is so great that the entire region will be on the brink of catastrophe while it is in operation.
<P>    
On 26 September 1995 the Armenian authorities intend to resume operation of this nuclear power plant, despite objections raised by many States.
<P>
The IAEA has never taken any decision to the effect that the Medzamor nuclear power plant is safe in terms of its technical parameters. We believe that the IAEA, as an authoritative international organization, should intensify its controls and its influence throughout the Southern Caucasus region. The Republic of Azerbaijan hopes that this esteemed organization, recognizing the full extent of the danger of operating the Medzamor nuclear power plant, will take all steps available to it to prevent its startup in order to avert disaster.

<H3>IAEA DIRECTOR GENERAL HANS BLIX CITES NEW RESPONSIBILITIES AHEAD</H3>
<P>
<I>Highlights of his Statement to the 39th regular session of the IAEA General Conference</I>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Global nuclear developments are accelerating the evolution of IAEA roles and responsibilities to meet new needs of States in areas of nuclear verification, safety, and technology transfer, IAEA Director General Hans Blix said today in an opening statement to the Agency's General Conference. The Conference of the IAEA's 122 Member States, which sets the Agency's programmes and policies, is meeting this week in Vienna, Austria. 
<P>
"Credible IAEA verification that nuclear materials and related items remain in peaceful activities is an increasingly important factor in nuclear disarmament and global security planning," Dr. Blix said.  "At the same time, the magnitude and complexity of the safeguards task continues to increase."  In addition, he pointed out, "large increases in the verification effort may result if nuclear materials removed from the military sphere of nuclear-weapon States are placed under safeguards."  The Agency started verifying such material last year, he noted.
<P>
In reviewing the Agency's programmes and plans, Dr. Blix highlighted developments in a number of specific areas.  They included the IAEA's consideration of a request by France to conduct a radiological assessment of its current series of nuclear tests; the Agency's  ongoing verification in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; IAEA nuclear inspections in Iraq under the mandate of the UN  Security Council; measures to strengthen IAEA nuclear safeguards; possible new verification roles for the Agency; actions against the illicit trafficking in nuclear materials;  steps for greater global cooperation in nuclear safety and radioactive waste management; nuclear energy and the environment;  and initiatives to strengthen technical cooperation activities.
<P>
In many cases, he pointed out, measures being taken at the IAEA are moving forward in spite of continuing budget constraints, and he attributed progress to extrabudgetary resources provided by some Member States, ongoing improvements in programme management and implementation, and the efficiency and skills of IAEA staff. "The machinery of the IAEA has been working at full steam, even with some overpressure," he said, "and we can register considerable movement forward in many areas."
<P>
Selected highlights of the Director General's address follow.
<P>
<B>French nuclear tests</B>.  The Director General noted a recent letter he received from the French Foreign Minister, making reference to the irreversible commitment of France to conclude a comprehensive nuclear test ban in 1996 and its intention to undertake a final series of nuclear tests before that time, and inviting the Agency to conduct a radiological assessment of its series of nuclear tests. Dr. Blix said that the IAEA is considering the request.  Agency officials are now consulting French authorities, he said, on matters pertaining to the objectives, scope, modalities, and required expertise for such a scientific mission.  He pointed out that the Agency has some "first hand experience" in this field, in light of scientific studies it has previously done at the French Pacific test sites, as well as at sites connected with the former Soviet Union's military nuclear programme at Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan.
<P>
<B>Safeguards in the DPRK</B>.  The IAEA recently held technical discussions with authorities in the DPRK as part of  its ongoing verification efforts, he said.  "To come into full compliance with the safeguards agreement," Dr. Blix said, "the DPRK will have to do something it has not yet been willing to do, namely enable the Agency effectively to verify the accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's initial report of nuclear material subject to the agreement."  The recent discussions resulted in limited progress on some issues, Dr. Blix said.  A substantial paper of technical proposals transmitted by the Agency was accepted "only for study, not for discussion" he said.
<P>
<B>Nuclear inspections in Iraq</B>.  The Agency is verifying new information and data it has received concerning Iraq's thwarted plans in 1990-91 to develop a nuclear weapon, Dr. Blix said.  He said that  so far in its review of the new information, "nothing suggests that a change is warranted" in the Agency's conclusion that the essential components of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons programme have been identified and destroyed, removed, or rendered harmless. He noted that the new Iraqi statements, and all the documents and materials that the Agency has received, will have to be carefully examined for new data.  "That they have been withheld for so long is clearly a breach of Iraq's obligations under Security Council resolutions," he said.
<P>
<B>Strengthening IAEA safeguards</B>.  Dr. Blix reviewed key components of Agency measures  -- some already being implemented and others remaining under consideration --  to develop and implement a strengthened and more cost-effective safeguards system. He noted in particular steps to ensure increased access to information about nuclear programmes and broader inspector access to sites within a State.  "By making their nuclear activities as transparent as possible to the Agency," he said, "States can help provide the basis for more effective and efficient safeguards."   Regarding the costs of strengthening measures, he said they may be offset by efficiencies elsewhere in the safeguards systems. However, he added, "any significant increase in the number of countries accepting full-scope safeguards, or in the number of facilities and amount of material under safeguards, will inevitably involve additional costs."
<P>
<B>New and emerging verification roles</B>.  Citing developments in areas of nuclear non- proliferation, arms control, and disarmament, Dr. Blix said that  some possible new verification roles for the Agency are in sight.  "Far-reaching implications" for the IAEA's future work, he said, emanate from the outcome of the Review and Extension Conference of Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in May 1995.  Among other things, he noted that the Conference expressly recognized the IAEA as the competent authority responsible for verifying and assuring compliance with safeguards agreements; recommended that nuclear material released from military use should be placed under IAEA safeguards; envisaged the universal application of safeguards once the elimination of nuclear weapons had been achieved; set 1996 as the target date for the conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; called for the early conclusion of a "cut-off"  agreement to end the production of nuclear material for use in weapons; and endorsed the creation of additional nuclear-weapon-free zones (NWFZs). Dr. Blix pointed out that IAEA safeguards are being considered as an "essential element" of the verification mechanism for a cut-off agreement; that the Agency would have a verification role in any new NWFZ, given existing models; and that the IAEA already carries out safeguards tasks of relevance to verification of a test ban treaty, though its possible roles under a specific test ban treaty remain to be determined. 
<P>
<B>Illicit trafficking in nuclear materials</B>.  In reviewing key elements of the Agency's action programme against problems of illicit nuclear trafficking, Dr. Blix noted that the work is part of efforts by nuclear, customs, and enforcement authorities of many countries and a number of international organizations to strengthen and coordinate controls on radioactive materials.  "It is clear that more efforts are needed and that States must exercise greater prudence in the use and storage of all radioactive materials," he said.   He noted that the Agency's programme is largely directed to assisting States in areas related to the accounting and control of nuclear materials; physical protection methods and technology; and the establishment of a database to provide factual information about reported incidents of trafficking. 
<P>
<B>Nuclear safety and radioactive waste management</B>.  The Director General cited a number of developments.  He said that the Convention on Nuclear Safety, adopted in June 1994, could enter into force as early as next year, and that preparations for a Convention on Radioactive Waste Safety have been "encouraging", with a final draft possible by next year.  Work also is continuing, he noted, for a Diplomatic Conference in 1996 to revise the Vienna Convention on liability for nuclear damage. Regarding the Agency's work on the safety assessment of nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, he said that an international consensus now exists that identifies the major safety issues and their significance for each of the various reactor types.  He further noted that Agency experts have been working closely with authorities in Armenia and Russia regarding safety issues at the Medzamor nuclear plant, which the Government of Armenia plans to restart. Separately, he noted, the Agency is working with Russian authorities on possible cooperative activities between Russia and other States in areas of radioactive waste management.  The Director General also pointed towards a major international conference being organized for April 1996 by the IAEA, World Health Organization, and European Union to sum up the accumulated knowledge about the nature and magnitude of the consequences of the Chernobyl accident. 
<P>
<B>Nuclear energy and the environment</B>.  The Director General reviewed the Agency's programme on the comparative assessment of energy sources, which is providing documented data, methodologies, and analyses on the comparative economic social, health, and environmental aspects of different energy sources for electricity generation.  "Detailed studies on the emissions and residuals from nuclear, fossil, and renewable energy chains show that nuclear power in normal operation is one of the most environmentally friendly ways of generating electricity," he said.  He noted that the IAEA is convening an international symposium next month to review recent progress in the Agency's programme.
<P>
<B>Technical cooperation</B>.   The IAEA's technical cooperation programme delivery is the highest ever in the history of the Agency, the Director General noted.  He attributed the increase to improved management practices, better design and support of projects and other iniatives.  He further emphasized that the success of programmes depends on the availability of predictable resources, and appealed for full contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund.  In reviewing specific projects, Dr. Blix referred to special reports before the General Conference on isotope hydrology and the use of nuclear energy for potable water production.

<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
The machinery of the IAEA has been working at full steam - even with some overpressure - since the General Conference met in 1994 and we can register considerable movement forward in many areas.  I shall report to you about activities in the past year and about plans for the future.
<P>
<B>The NPT Conference</B>
<P>
In May this year the Review and Extension Conference decided to extend the Non- Proliferation Treaty indefinitely.  This decision, testifying to the solid and broad commitment to nuclear non-proliferation, was greeted with relief and enthusiasm in many capitals.  We should not close our eyes, however, to the reality that the decision was received with mixed feelings in a number of other capitals, where it was a matter of concern that the extension meant also an indefinite recognition of the nuclear-weapon status of five States parties.  I submit that a forward-looking interpretation of the extension decision, and the principles and objectives which were also adopted, would be that they constitute a collective commitment to bring us to a world in which nuclear energy is used for positive, peaceful purposes and in which no single nation possesses nuclear weapons; that is a commitment by non-nuclear-weapon States not to acquire these weapons and a commitment by the five declared nuclear-weapon States to effective and accelerated nuclear disarmament.   
<P>
The outcome of the NPT Conference has far-reaching implications for the future work of the IAEA.  A continued role was envisaged for the Agency in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and an expanded role was foreseen for it in verification.  The IAEA was expressly recognized as the competent authority responsible for verifying and assuring compliance with safeguards agreements.  The Conference further stated that parties to the NPT that have concerns regarding non-compliance with the safeguards agreements should direct such concerns, along with supporting evidence and information, to the IAEA for it to consider, investigate, draw conclusions and decide on necessary actions in accordance with its mandate.  I read this provision as an endorsement of the Agency's verification role as it has evolved in recent years. The Conference also called for support for the Agency's ongoing actions to strengthen safeguards, and to increase its capability to detect any undeclared nuclear activities.  It was further recommended that nuclear material released from military use should be placed under IAEA safeguards as soon as practicable and the universal application of safeguards was envisaged once the elimination of nuclear weapons had been achieved.  
<P>
The NPT Conference set 1996 as the target date for the conclusion of a comprehensive test ban agreement - a step which is widely viewed as a vital complement to non-proliferation and a symbol of progress towards nuclear disarmament.  It further called for the early conclusion of an agreement to end the production of nuclear material for use in weapons - a cutoff agreement - and it endorsed the creation of additional nuclear-weapon-free zones.  The assumption underlying current discussions on the cut-off agreement is that IAEA safeguards would be an essential element of the verification mechanism.  It may also be assumed - if existing models are an indication - that the Agency would have a verification role in any new nuclear-weapon-free zone.  In relation to a comprehensive test ban it is relevant to note, as I have done before, that such a ban in reality already exists for all the non-nuclear-weapon States parties to the NPT and is verified under comprehensive IAEA safeguards agreements.  What roles the Agency might be asked to assume under a specific comprehensive test ban treaty are yet to be determined by the States negotiating this treaty.
<P>
<B>The French Nuclear Tests</B>
<P>
Before I leave the question of nuclear weapon testing, let me report to you, as I did to the Board of Governors last week, that I have recently received a letter from the Foreign Minister of France in which reference is made to the irreversible commitment of France to conclude a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty in 1996 and its intention to undertake a final series of nuclear tests before that time.  The Minister asked whether the IAEA would be willing to conduct a scientific mission to assess the radiological impact of these tests.  Such assessment would have to be complemented by an assessment of the geological situation of the test site. In reply I have indicated that for the Agency to take a decision on the matter, a number of preliminary questions would need to be carefully considered - including the objective and the scope of the mission, its modalities and the composition of a team.  I added that the Secretariat wanted to consult with the French authorities as well as with others on these issues. Consultations with French experts are scheduled for this week.
<P>
As you are aware, the Agency provides numerous services to its Member States in the field of nuclear safety and radiological protection and has established radiation safety standards. The French inquiry is being considered in that context.  You may also be aware that a mission was sent by the Agency to Kazakhstan last year to assess the radiological situation at the Semipalatinsk test site, and that a similar mission is being planned for the Marshall Islands. Also, our Monaco Laboratory has co-ordinated two inter-laboratory calibration exercises using various samples taken in 1991 and 1994 from the area of the French Pacific test sites.  We therefore have some first hand experience in this field.
<P>
<B>Strengthened IAEA Safeguards</B>
<P>
Credible IAEA verification that nuclear materials and related items remain in peaceful activities is an increasingly important factor in nuclear disarmament and global security planning.  At the same time the magnitude and complexity of the safeguards task continues to increase.  In 1994 the IAEA inspection effort rose by more than 12% over the previous year. The increasing importance and volume of the safeguards effort impels us to develop and implement a strengthened and more cost-effective system.  A full report on the actions that have been taken under the so-called Programme 93+2 is given in document <A HREF=/GC/gc3917.html>GC(39)/17</A> and corrigendum.
<P>
Increased access to information about nuclear programmes and broader inspector access to sites within the State are fundamental prerequisites for strengthened safeguards.  To obtain this has been the main thrust of the 93+2 Programme which the Board of Governors is considering.  While some of the desired measures will require additional authority which must be sought, other measures can be implemented under the authority of existing comprehensive safeguards agreements.  I welcome that the Board has taken note of the Secretariat's intention to achieve such implementation at an early date, after consultations and clarifications to dispel any remaining concerns of Member States.
<P>
By making their nuclear activities as transparent as possible to the Agency, States can help provide the basis for more effective and efficient safeguards.  They will have to decide whether they are prepared - as I think is in their interest - to routinely provide greater access to information and locations than is presently required under safeguards agreements.  Needless to say, the new arrangements must be both practical and cost-effective and make use of state-of- the-art verification techniques.  The experience gained in trial arrangements made with several States suggests that in practice the cost to States of, say, granting multiple visas for inspectors and wider access within installations, is not great.  It is really only a matter of a somewhat more co-operative attitude to facilitate strengthened and more efficient inspection.   
<P>
We believe that after a start-up period they may be offset by efficiencies elsewhere in the safeguards system.  However, any significant increase in the number of countries accepting full-scope safeguards, or in the number of facilities and amount of material under safeguards, will inevitably involve additional costs.
<P> 
Large increases in the verification effort may result if nuclear materials removed from the military sphere of nuclear-weapon States are placed under safeguards - as was urged by the NPT Conference.  Verification of such material started just one year ago and the present arrangements foresee funding through extrabudgetary contributions.  An expansion of the IAEA verification that such nuclear material remains in the peaceful sphere to which it has been transferred requires special arrangements which are reliable and cover the full costs of this inspection effort.
<P>
<B>Safeguards Implementation in the DPRK</B>
<P>
Last year I reported that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was not in full compliance with its safeguards agreement pursuant to the NPT.  Document <A HREF=/GC/gc3918.html>GC(39)/18</A> summarizes the many developments of the past year.  Important among these is the framework which was agreed between the DPRK and the USA and which provides for a freeze and the eventual dismantling of the DPRK's graphite moderated reactors and related facilities and states the intention of the DPRK to come into full compliance with the safeguards agreement.  On 4 November last year, the Security Council confirmed that the safeguards agreement remained in force and binding and requested the Agency to take the necessary steps to monitor the freeze. With the authorization of the Board, we have been doing this through the continuous presence of inspectors in the DPRK and I can confirm that the freeze has been put into effect and is maintained.
<P>
However, to come into full compliance with the safeguards agreement, the DPRK will have to do something it has not yet been willing to do, namely enable the Agency effectively to verify the accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's initial report of nuclear material subject to the agreement.  In the absence of the required compliance, it is essential that all necessary steps be taken to preserve any information that is relevant to this verification.
<P>
Technical discussions have been held with the DPRK with respect to the activities to be carried out pursuant to the safeguards agreement at the DPRK's nuclear facilities, irrespective of their status under the freeze.  Since the first of these discussions in November last year, arrangements have been in place enabling the Agency to meet many of its objectives.  However, a number of issues remain, including the verification of the spent fuel of the 5 MW(e) reactor, the installation of monitoring equipment in the waste tanks of the reprocessing plant and the preservation, intact, of information relevant to the verification of the accuracy and completeness of the initial declaration. In the last few days, a new round of IAEA-DPRK discussions has taken place at technical meetings in the DPRK. Limited progress was made on some issues. However, a substantial paper of technical proposals transmitted by the Agency was accepted only for study -- not for discussion.
<P>
<B>Agency Verification in Iraq under Security Council Resolutions</B>
<P>
As I reported to the UN General Assembly in October last year, it is the Secretariat's conclusion that the essential components of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons programme have been identified and destroyed, removed or rendered harmless.  This assessment was not based on faith in Iraqi statements, but on data gathered during inspections, on information provided by suppliers and Member States and, to a great extent, on analysis of the large number of original documents which were obtained in Iraq by the teams of the sixth and seventh IAEA inspection missions.
<P>
Since August 1994 IAEA inspectors are continuously present in Iraq to perform ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with relevant Security Council resolutions. This does not exclude renewed inspections for the purpose of investigations, if such should be called for to verify any new information.
<P>
Recently the IAEA has received additional information on Iraq's former nuclear weapons programme by way of new statements made and numerous documents and materials transmitted to the IAEA and to UNSCOM by Iraq following the departure to Amman of General Hussein Kamel, the former Iraqi Minister of Industry and Military Industrialization <A HREF=/GC/gc3910a1.html>(GC(39)/10, Add.1)</A>. Of the new information which has been reviewed to date nothing suggests that a change is warranted in the Agency's conclusion which I have referred to.  What we have been told is that as of August/September 1990, Iraqi authorities had the intention to take the safeguarded highly enriched research reactor uranium fuel at Tuwaitha (the nuclear research centre), extract the pure uranium by the spring of 1991, transform it into weapons-grade uranium metal and then use it to make a nuclear weapon.  It is uncertain whether they would have been able to overcome the considerable technical difficulties involved in this plan.  As it was, the plan was made impossible by damage inflicted on Tuwaitha through bombings in January 1991.
<P>
Let me note that the new Iraqi statements and all the documents and materials to which I have referred will have to be carefully examined for any new data.  That they have been withheld for so long is clearly a breach of Iraq's obligations under Security Council resolutions.
<P>
What I further think should be noted in this affair is that prima facie it shows that the Iraqi authorities would not have hesitated to take nuclear material under safeguards and to time the operation in such a way as to make maximum use of the period before the next scheduled IAEA inspection, at which time the violation of the safeguards agreement would have become known.  While taking the fuel would not have needed much time, processing and transforming it into bomb grade material would have taken more time.  As I said, the effort was thwarted by bombing.
<P>
Some other lessons may also be drawn from this affair.  One is that the replacement of high enriched uranium fuel by low enriched fuel in research reactors can, indeed, reduce the risk of proliferation.  A second is that the change introduced in the safeguards system post Iraq in favour of more frequent inspections to ensure the timely detection of a diversion of a significant quantity of safeguarded material is prudent.  A third is that real-time remote transmission of data, when it becomes readily available, will provide a useful tool for achieving immediate detection of diversion.
<P>
I turn now to developments in some regional arrangements.
<P>
<B>Tlatelolco Treaty</B>
<P>
I am pleased to be able to report further positive developments in relation to the Treaty of Tlatelolco.  Since the last General Conference two States have become Party to the Treaty, two States have ratified it and one, Cuba, has signed it.  This brings us closer to the date when the Treaty will enter into force for the entire zone of application and makes it essential that the required safeguards agreements be in force with all the States parties to the Treaty.  
<P> 
At its June meeting, the Board of Governors authorized the Secretariat to take action to obtain the prompt conclusion of all safeguards agreements outstanding pursuant to the Tlatelolco Treaty.  The Secretariat is very actively engaged in ensuring that the required safeguards agreements are concluded.  I appeal to the States concerned to fulfil their obligation under the Treaty to ensure that there is no delay in its entry into force for the entire zone of application.
<P>
<B>Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Africa</B>
<P>
As requested by the General Conference last year, the Agency has continued to assist the African States in their efforts to establish an African nuclear-weapon-free zone, in particular in the elaboration of the verification regime.  A draft Treaty text which, inter alia, entrusts the Agency with the task of verification, was considered and endorsed by the OAU Council of Ministers and the African Heads of State in Addis Ababa last June and it is expected that the draft Treaty will be considered by this year's General Assembly of the United Nations and that Africa will soon become yet another nuclear-weapon-free zone.
<P>
<B>Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in the Middle East</B>
<P>
In resolution <A HREF=/worldatom/glance/policy/gcres21.html>GC(XXXVIII)/RES/21</A>, the General Conference last year called upon all parties directly concerned to consider taking the practical and appropriate steps required to establish a mutually and effectively verifiable nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East region.  The resolution also requested the Director General to continue consultations with the States of the Middle East to facilitate the early application of full-scope Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the region and the preparation of model verification agreements as a step towards the establishment of such a zone.  As I have reported to previous General Conferences, model verification agreements cannot easily be prepared until the States concerned have clarified their views on the main issues of substance.  This is not yet the case.  Meanwhile the Agency is participating in some discussions on these issues within the peace process.  I intend to continue my visits to and consultations with States in the region in order further to explore the verification questions and the material obligations which may be agreed upon and may call for verification.
<P>
<B>Trafficking</B>
<P>
A year ago, the international community expressed alarm at the number of incidents of illicit trafficking in radioactive materials that had been reported in 1994 and the General Conference invited me to take a number of actions to supplement the measures taken by governments.  In 1995 there have been further seizures of illicitly held radioactive materials and it is clear that more efforts are needed and that States must exercise greater prudence in the use and storage of all radioactive materials.
<P>
In responding to the problems of nuclear trafficking, nuclear, customs and enforcement authorities of many countries and a number of international organizations are seeking to strengthen and co-ordinate their efforts to control and protect radioactive materials.  Only last week the IAEA hosted a large interagency meeting which reached a number of useful joint conclusions.  Within the IAEA, an Action Programme has been approved by the Board of Governors.  We are already conducting training courses in the operation of State systems of accounting for and controlling nuclear materials.  In addition, with the help of experts from Member States, courses are being arranged on physical protection methods and technology. Activities are further underway to help States address the radiation hazards connected with illicit trafficking.  For 1997 a conference is planned to further facilitate the exchange of information and expertise on physical protection.  Meanwhile, the Agency is establishing a database of trafficking incidents to provide factual information to member governments and the public.  In July the UN Security Council expressed its full support to the Agency and other international bodies for their work in this field.  A full report on the Agency's actions is before you (document <A HREF=/GC/gc3919.html>GC(39)/19</A>).
<P>  
<B>Strengthening Technical Co-operation</B>
<P>
Let me turn now to the Technical Co-operation Programme of the Agency, and in particular the initiatives taken to strengthen it and to improve delivery.  (Detailed information on measures taken in the past year are set out in document <A HREF=/GC/gc3913.html>GC(39)/13</A>).  Our technical co-operation with Member States must reflect their priorities for scientific, technological as well as economic and social development.  However, a careful study of the programmes actually requested shows that they have often covered a wide range of areas, not all of them clearly related to national development goals.  
<P> 
Several initiatives have been taken to make the technical co-operation programme more effective and more relevant to the sustainable development of Member States.  In the latter regard I commend to your attention a recent document (GOV/INF/773 of 8 September 1995) describing the Agency's considerable contribution to "Agenda 21 on the Environment and Sustainable Development".
<P>
Following the recommendations of the Fourth Policy Review Seminar last year, the Secretariat, working together with Member States, has started preparing "Country Programme Frameworks" which will help focus the programmes on key areas of government priority to maximize the impact.  Another initiative aims at having fewer but better focused projects.  I urge governments to help by submitting somewhat fewer projects - and to ensure that they are in line with their development needs and have the full backing of the national authorities.
<P>
Another measure planned is the promotion of technical co-operation among developing countries, or TCDC.  The idea is to subcontract institutions in developing countries which are recognized as centres of excellence in a particular field to implement selected technical co- operation projects for given countries.
<P>
I am pleased to inform the Conference that the technical co-operation programme delivery as of 30 August 1995 is the highest ever in the history of the Agency.  This is largely due to improved management practices, better design and support of projects and a careful overprogramming introduced this year with the Board's approval.  As a consequence, not only will developing Member States receive more assistance in 1995, but also the carryover of unused financial resources will be greatly reduced.  At the NPT Review and Extension Conference all participants acknowledged the importance of the work of the Agency as the principal agent for the transfer of nuclear technology to developing countries and welcomed the successful operation of the Agency's technical assistance and co-operation programmes.  It was also recognized that the success of these programmes depends on the availability of predictable resources.  I appeal, therefore, to all Member States to make full voluntary contributions to the Technical Co-operation Fund.
<P>
<B>Technology Development and Transfer </B>
<P>
Successive General Conferences have drawn attention to various areas of nuclear research and development of particular interest to developing countries.  In response to such requests, you have before you special reports on isotope hydrology and the use of nuclear energy for potable water production.  Let me briefly highlight one of those areas as well as some other issues of particular interest at this time.
<P>
<B>Sea Water Desalination Using Nuclear Energy</B>
<P>
The availability of potable water is a growing problem in many Member States. Considerable progress was made last year as regards the evaluation of the technical and economic feasibility of seawater desalination using nuclear energy.  The North African regional feasibility study has been completed, showing that the use of nuclear power plants for desalination is technically feasible and the costs competitive with that of fossil plants in the region.  A similar feasibility study for Saudi Arabia is still under way. 
<P>
Studies have also continued on practical options for nuclear desalination demonstration projects.  However, the success of this programme is very much dependent on the availability of sufficient extrabudgetary contributions from interested Member States.   I appeal for further support for it.
<P>
<B>Irradiated Sewage Sludge</B>
<P>
The Agency's Programme and Budget for 1995-96 contains a new multi-disciplinary project on the use of nuclear techniques for the management of liquid wastes - one of the major environmental problems identified in Agenda 21 of the Rio Summit on Environment and Development.    
<P>
A new Co-ordinated Research Programme (CRP) was initiated on "The Use of Irradiated Sewage Sludge to Increase Soil Fertility, Crop Yields and to Preserve the Environment".  The aim is to find ways by which solid and liquid wastes from households and industry could be utilized as a source of organic matter and nutrients for increasing crop production.  This would reduce the needs for chemical fertilizers, and also the environmental pollution of other sewage treatment processes.   The use of gamma and electron beam irradiators to eliminate disease- producing microbial pathogens is a promising technique that would permit the safe utilization of sludges as a biofertilizer.
<P>
<B>25 Years of the International Nuclear Information System (INIS)</B>
<P>
In May of this year the International Nuclear Information System (INIS) celebrated its 25th anniversary.  INIS plays a key role in providing access to nuclear information to support activities worldwide in many diverse areas, e.g. nuclear power,  safeguards, and nuclear techniques in food and agriculture.  The INIS database now includes over 1.8 million references of nuclear literature and is growing at the rate of about 85 000 records per year.  
<P>
New areas are introduced in the database as new demands arise in Member States. Thus, in 1992 references on environmental, health and economic aspects of non-nuclear energy sources were introduced in addition to those concerning nuclear energy.
<P>
INIS is by far the largest of the electronic databases created by the IAEA in co-operation with its Member States, and its continuing success reflects the active support and participation of those Member States.  INIS maintains its non-commercial character and continues to facilitate the availability of nuclear information to users in all participating countries irrespective of their levels of development.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Safety and Safe Radioactive Waste Management</B>
<P>
Document <A HREF=/GC/gc39inf8.html>(39)/INF/8</A> reports in a comprehensive manner the various measures which have been taken by the Agency to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear safety, radiological protection and radioactive waste management.  I will therefore limit my remarks to some developments of particular importance.
<P>
<B>Agency Management of Safety Issues</B>
<P>
With a view to consolidating all the Agency's safety-related activities into one organizational structure, the Department of Nuclear Energy and Safety will be divided into two distinct Departments - the Department of Nuclear Energy, and the Department of Nuclear Safety.  The latter will cover the three major safety disciplines - nuclear safety, radiation safety and radioactive waste safety.  One change connected with the division is the development of a modified and streamlined process for the preparation of all Agency safety standards.  The objective is to ensure uniformity and consistency in the preparation and review process of the documents covering the three interrelated safety disciplines.
<P>
<B>Convention on Nuclear Safety</B>
<P>
A major accomplishment in the nuclear safety area was the adoption in June last year of the Convention on Nuclear Safety.  So far the Convention has been signed by 59 States and ratified or accepted by nine.  A number of States are very close to ratification and I believe we can look forward to the Convention entering into force next year.  Representatives of signatories of the Convention and other interested States will meet for the second time in November to continue discussions on the implementation process. The Agency is ready to assist States in meeting their obligations through, for example, its wide range of safety services.
<P>
<B>Convention on Radioactive Waste Safety</B>
<P>
The preamble of the Convention on Nuclear Safety urges the preparation of a Convention on the safe management of radioactive waste.  In this regard significant progress has been made.  At the end of its first meeting, in July, the open-ended group of legal and technical experts entrusted its chairman, Professor Baer from Switzerland, with the preparation of a draft of the Convention.  This draft will be considered at the second meeting of the group in December.  The progress made so far is encouraging and if the pace is maintained a final draft could perhaps be ready some time next year.
<P>
<B>Liability </B>
<P>
Since the last session of the General Conference the Standing Committee on Liability for Nuclear Damage has recommended, albeit with some reservations, that a diplomatic conference be convened in 1996 to revise the Vienna Convention and to adopt a system of supplementary funding.  However, some fundamental issues remain to be resolved.  As work on revision of the Vienna Convention is nearing completion but cannot progress further without concomitant results on the issue of supplementary funding, the Standing Committee has devoted much effort to elaborate an instrument on supplementary funding.  There will be an informal meeting next week and I hope that the efforts made will facilitate the emergence of a broadly acceptable draft convention - and thereby provide the necessary basis for a successful Diplomatic Conference and a viable international instrument on liability.
<P>
While work continues on the strengthening of international nuclear liability arrangements, I should like to mention that the number of States that have ratified the Vienna Convention and Joint Protocol has grown, especially among States in Eastern and Central Europe, and now stands at 26 and 20 respectively.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Safety in the Former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe</B>
<P>
The Agency's work on the safety assessment of nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union has continued and an international consensus now exists, identifying the major safety issues and their significance for each of the various reactor types.  The emphasis is now shifting to a review of the status of implementation of the proposed safety improvements and to the collection of up-to-date information on the upgrading situation at each of the reactors involved.  These results of our work provide input into bilateral and multilateral assistance projects co-ordinated by the G-24 mechanism in Brussels.
<P>     
Following the decision by the Armenian Government to restart Medzamor Unit 2 reactor, an Agency mission visited Armenia in April 1995.  Its report pointed to a difficult safety situation, including a number of unresolved technical issues.  I conveyed these results to the Armenian Government and stressed the need to solve the safety issues before plant restart.  I also stressed the need for highly competent and well trained operating staff.  Armenia has had considerable co-operation from Russia and the Agency has responded to requests for assistance on several safety related issues, e.g. evaluation of the seismic situation and of the condition of the pressure vessel as well as on emergency planning.  Responsibility for all steps which are needed before start-up and for safety upgrades thereafter rests, of course, with the Government.
<P>
I must again draw your attention to the fact that we continue to rely on extrabudgetary resources for the major part of our assistance efforts in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
<P>
<B>Chernobyl Conference</B>
<P>
The tenth anniversary of the tragic accident at the Chernobyl NPP, in April 1986, will provide an occasion for different authorities and international organizations to arrange meetings at which various consequences of this accident will be assessed.  These events will culminate here in Vienna on 8-12 April 1996 in an international conference that will seek to sum up the accumulated knowledge.  The Conference is jointly sponsored by the WHO, the EU and the Agency and it is organized in co-operation with several other organizations.  It will consider the findings of the prior meetings on the health consequences of the accident, its associated environmental, social, economic and political impacts, the remedial measures taken to improve the safety of Chernobyl-type reactors and the reliability of the containment structure (sarcophagus) of the destroyed reactor.  The April Conference is intended to seek a common and conclusive understanding of the nature and magnitude of the consequences of the accident. 
<P>
<B>Radioactive Waste Management in the Russian Federation</B>
<P>
In the context of measures taken by the Agency to resolve international waste management issues, the Agency organized in May this year, at the request of the Nordic Council of Ministers and with the co-operation of the Russian Federation, a Seminar on International Co-operation on Nuclear Waste Management in the Russian Federation.  A comprehensive picture was provided of the present waste management programmes, structures and problems in Russia and an overview was obtained of the co-operation with Russia in the field of nuclear waste management.  A Contact Expert Group will be established under the auspices of the IAEA for the purpose of organizing and following up co-operative activities between Russia and other States.  A first meeting of this Group is being organized by the IAEA in Stockholm later this week.
<P>
Nuclear Energy and the Environment: the DECADES (Databases and Methodologies for
Comparative Assessment of Different Energy Sources for Electricity Generation)
Programme
<P>
One of the major future challenges in the energy field will be to ensure sustainability. This will require both enhanced management of natural resources and a reduction of emissions which are dangerous to health and the environment.  Especially the threat of global climate change due to such emissions is high on the agenda of governments.  However, the first Conference of Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was held in Berlin at the end of March, has shown that reaching an international consensus on these matters will take some time.
<P>
Three years after the Rio "Earth Summit" the progress made, for example in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, is extremely small.  Carbon dioxide emissions have slowed only marginally in industrialized countries, and have continued to increase significantly in most developing countries, owing to energy demand growth and increasing use of fossil fuels which are the most readily available energy source.
<P>
The medium-term outlook is not better and if measures are not taken soon to reduce the share of fossil fuels, especially coal, in electricity generation  the substantial growth in energy and electricity consumption in many developing countries will lead to a serious increase of greenhouse gas emissions.  According to the findings of a number of recent studies, carbon dioxide emissions will grow also in Western Europe after the turn of the century.  The commissioning of new gas-fired or coal-fired power plants is the main cause of this trend.
<P>
In Europe, the case of France, where more than 75% of electricity is produced by nuclear power, clearly demonstrates that nuclear power can play a major role in reducing carbon dioxide, nitrogen and sulphur oxide emissions.  From this point of view it is to be welcomed that in Asia, with its rapidly expanding economies, both Japan and the Republic of Korea are pursuing their dynamic nuclear power programmes, and China is in the early phase of a planned large nuclear power programme.  In Japan, a study commissioned by the Science and Technology Agency has concluded that in order to curb carbon dioxide emissions to the 1990 levels, Japan will need about 80 GW(e) of nuclear power by the year 2020 and about 100 GW(e) by 2030.  At present, Japan has 39 GW(e) of nuclear power installed capacity.
<P> 
In this context, it is necessary to assess and compare all the available energy supply options, taking into account their technical and economic performance as well as their potential for alleviating damaging impacts on health and environments.  This is the focus of the Agency's programme on the comparative assessment of energy sources.
<P>
The findings from the so-called DECADES project, carried out by the IAEA in co- operation with several other international organizations, already provide documented data, methodologies and analyses on the comparative economic, social, health and environmental aspects of different energy sources for electricity generation.  Let me mention that detailed studies on the emissions and residuals from nuclear, fossil and renewable energy chains show that nuclear power in normal operation is one of the most environment friendly ways of generating electricity.  Some 20 case studies have been undertaken by national institutes in the framework of a Co-ordinated Research Programme to assess and compare alternative electricity system expansion strategies in different countries.  The preliminary results indicate that incorporating health and environmental aspects in the comparison of alternative strategies point, in a number of cases, to the introduction of nuclear power being the optimum strategy.  Such findings must, of course, be supplemented by considerations concerning industrial infrastructure, manpower, availability of capital, etc.
<P>
The International Symposium on Electricity, Health and the Environment, which will be held next month in Vienna, will provide a forum for senior planners and analysts to review recent progress in the comparative assessment of different energy sources.
<P>
Nuclear power alone cannot solve all of the problems involved in achieving a secure and sustainable energy supply worldwide but - together with renewable sources and energy conservation - it could play a very significant role in stable and sustainable energy strategies for the world.  The Agency must continue to make available the data that are relevant in this regard and factual information about the central issues of nuclear safety, waste disposal and non-proliferation, which are at the root of many people's concern about nuclear power.
<P>
<B>The Outlook for 1996 and Beyond</B>
<P>
The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations has encouraged wide public scrutiny of the UN system.  It is to be welcomed that shortcomings are identified and  improvements and reforms proposed.  Rejecting multilateralism, however, will only take us backward.  We must recognize that multilateral organizations, for a variety of purposes, are indispensible and that in the future ever more will be expected of them.
<P>
For the Agency it is clear that co-ordination and co-operation amongst international organizations remains one of the goals towards which we must all strive.  This was a major theme of a meeting hosted by the IAEA here in Vienna last February of the UN Administrative Committee on Co-ordination (ACC) chaired by the Secretary-General.
<P>
The expanding responsibilities of the IAEA, and the legitimate expectation that we identify priorities and limit costs, require that we continue a close critical scrutiny of programmes and seek rationalization of work methods.  In this regard, let me note:
<P>
First, that the rolling medium-term perspective that we have established - last year the General Conference had before it a draft Medium Term Plan for 1995-2000 - is designed to facilitate an orderly phasing out and phasing in  of programmes, in line with the changing needs of Member States.  The abrupt termination of programmes is often difficult and costly.  Such problems of change can be minimized through programmatic foresight.
<P>
Second, that in a two-day meeting last June a number of senior officials from Member States met with the Agency's senior management to look even beyond the year 2000.  There was an understanding that the Agency's roles must continue to evolve in various areas: the verification functions will grow; many of our activities in the area of nuclear safety and technology transfer will remain essential and programmes in the field of nuclear waste may expand.  Further, although the acquisition of nuclear technologies will increasingly become commercial rather than governmental decisions, the Agency should be ready to provide impartial advice on pros and cons of available nuclear and non-nuclear solutions to problems - in both power and non-power applications.  It was also stressed that the Secretariat must at all times be alert to the emergence of new technologies, be they nuclear, information or verification related.
<P>  
Third, that we are introducing some changes to rationalize the programme and organizational structure of the Agency.  As I have mentioned, as of the beginning of 1996, the new Department of Nuclear Safety will be established, thereby bringing together in one organizational unit the full range of Agency work related to nuclear safety.
<P>
Fourth, as suggested at the General Conference over a number of years, we have now introduced a new presentation and format of the Annual Report, and harmonized the Programme and Budget document and the Performance Report, and improved our procedures for formulating programme proposals.  We thereby hope to achieve increased transparency to our Members and increase their ability to influence programme developments in accordance with their priorities and interests.  Further, we are well underway for the shift to a programme- based system of accounting and control beginning in 1997.  Improved management through training and application of the Agency's Programme Performance and Assessment System (PPAS) should also help to bring about more effective programme implementation and rationalization.
<P>
We are also achieving efficiencies through the introduction or expanded use of new technologies, especially in the area of communications.  Many printed products are being replaced by electronic ones.  As word processing and electronic mail become the norm, support staff are able to perform a wider range of duties.  These efficiencies continue to contribute to our ability to improve programme delivery.  As the "Internet" becomes a tool for the public, the media and decision-makers, we are ensuring that many Agency products are available on it (address: <A HREF=http://www.iaea.or.at>http://www.iaea.or.at</A>).  I would expect that increasing use can be made of electronic communications for the business of the governing bodies and for the work of the Agency generally.  As an example, the Department of Technical Co-operation is planning to encourage Member States to submit project proposals in electronically readable form.  This would greatly help to reduce paper work and expedite the technical appraisal process.
<P>
Lastly, in response to resolutions adopted by the General Conference, special efforts have been made to increase the professional representation of women and staff from developing countries in the Secretariat.  The results of these efforts are reflected in document GOV/GC(39)/15.  When the number of staff is static - as ours has been  - change is not easy. Also, some of our activities require very specialized skills from a very limited labour market. We continue to look for ways to improve the situation.  Member States could sometimes do more to help identify and make available well qualified candidates from the under-represented target groups.  On some occasions we have been unable to obtain "government sponsorship" for appointments involving women and candidates from developing countries.  
<P>
In spite of the constraints on resources, I believe we have managed during the last ten years to deliver an expanding programme and to respond to needs of Member States.  This result certainly could not have been achieved without extrabudgetary contributions from several governments.  It is also in large measure attributable to the efficiency, skill and loyalty of staff who have responded positively and creatively to the challenges.  I regret that this effort has not been matched by corresponding improvements in the conditions of employment of the professional staff.  The current remuneration scheme of the Common System is outdated and compares very unfavourably with those applied to comparable work in other intergovernmental systems, such as the OECD, the World Bank and the European Community.
<P>
It is a great relief that the Board of Governors last week reached a consensus on a package comprising the financing of safeguards and targets for contributions to the Technical Assistance and Co-operation Fund.  It remains a matter of concern, however, that a zero real growth budget is being proposed for 1996 - the twelfth consecutive year - and that we have not been able to incorporate into the regular budget several activities regarded as essential.  Let me conclude by recalling that the NPT Conference urged that every effort be made to ensure that the IAEA has the financial and human resources necessary to meet effectively its responsibilities in the areas of technical co-operation, safeguards and nuclear safety.  I hope that all the Governments which gave their full support to these conclusions in New York will be equally supportive in Vienna in the coming year as we grapple with the resource questions which arise from the expanding demands placed on the Agency.  
<P>
Finally, I should like to acknowledge with thanks the continuing support and co-operation which we and the other international agencies in Vienna have received from our host, the Government of Austria and from the city of Vienna.  The facilities we are provided here at the VIC remain amongst the best of their kind in the world and do much to help maintain the efficiency of our activities.

<P>                                               
I extend my warmest greetings to the participants at this, the thirty-ninth General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency. You have a challenging agenda. You face issues of compelling global significance.
<P>
This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Much has been achieved. There have been many accomplishments. Throughout the Organization's existence the potential for close cooperation among the different parts of the United Nations system has been an important source of strength. Cooperation between the International Atomic Energy Agency and other parts of the United Nations system has been especially close and productive. These relationships must continue to be strengthened.
<P>
Amidst the many uncertainties of the post-Cold War era.  international peace, security, and development require that the international community give issues of nuclear control and nuclear safety the very highest priority. The world can take comfort from the fact that we are no longer standing at the edge of a nuclear precipice. But now is no time to rest. The stakes remain high. And time is not on our side.
<P>
The agenda is long. The items are compelling. Urgent priorities include preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons. halting nuclear testing, improving verification capabilities, stopping the illicit traffic in nuclear and other radioactive materials, banning the production of fissile materials for explosive devices, guaranteeing the safe disposal of radioactive wastes, and ensuring the continued safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy and related technologies.
<P>
The Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is the cornerstone of international efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. Full adherence to the Treaty by all States is essential to international peace and security. It is our best hope for a world free of nuclear weapons.
<P>
I welcome tho positive results that were achieved at the Review and Extension Conference on the Non-Proliferation Treaty which took place earlier this year in New York. The indefinite extension of the Treaty has sent a needed signal. The decision to enhance the review process for the Treaty will help to strengthen internatlonal commitments. The agreements on Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament are an important and useful step forward.
<P>
The NPT Conference set 1996 as the target date for the conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. A majority of the international community view a complete ban on nuclear testing as a prerequisite for further progress towards non-proliferation and the eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons. Under the auspices of the United Nations in Geneva, negotiations are now proceeding on a comprehensive test ban treaty. I urge all participants to re-double their efforts. I appeal to all States to voluntarily refrain from nuclear testing, and to demonstrate to the world their commitment to a future free of nuclear weapons.
<P>
The NPT Conference also called for an early conclusion of an agreement to ban the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. Such an agreement would be a significant contribution to nuclear non-proliferation. I call for the immediate commencement and early concluslon of negotiations on such an agreement.
<P>
In a recent letter, the Security Councll expressed its continued full support for the work being done by the IAEA and others to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive materials. I urge the Agency to examine ways in which it can further assist Member States in meeting their obligations. The international community will need to be far more vigilant than it has been if this menace is to be controlled.
<P>
In promoting international peace and security, full and mutually supportive cooperation between the Security Council and the IAEA will, as in the past, continue to be essential. The Agency's ongoing monitoring and verification activities in Iraq -- conducted in furtherance of Security Council resolutions -- demonstrate both the need and the importance of such cooperation.
<P>
I am pleased to note that since my last statement to you at the thirty-eighth session of the General Conference, there have been important developments in the implementation of IAEA safeguards in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The Agency and the DPRK have held extensive technical discussions relating to safeguards.  These are positive developments.
<P>
I welcome the Agency's efforts to strengthen its safeguards system, including its capacity to detect undeclared nuclear activities.  Verification is critical to an effective non-proliferation regime. Without effective verification there can be no firm basis for confidence. I pledge the continued active support of the United Nations for steps to strengthen the Agency's safeguards system. I urge all States to give their full support, including financial support, to these efforts.
<P>
The further development of nuclear applications in a wide variety of peaceful fields, and the IAEA's work related to the implementation of Agenda 21 and other development initiatives underline the broad mandate of the Agency, and why it is such an important part of the United Nation's family.
<P>
The IAEA will continue to have important international responsibilities in dealing with nuclear safety, radioactive waste management, and radiological protection. I urge Member States to ratify the Nuclear Safety Conventlon without delay, and to facilitate its early entry into force. I also urge all Member States who are in a position to do so to contribute actively to the development of the proposed Convention on the Safe Management of Radioactive Waste, and to participate in the work of the Standing Committee on Liability for Nuclear Damage.
<P>
In addressing the compelling challenges of global peace, security, and development, we can succeed only if we all work together. I pledge to you my full support for your efforts. I reaffirm my strong commitment to maintaining the close collaboration that has come to characterize the relationship between the IAEA and the United Nations. There is much to be done. Let us continue to go forward together.
<P>
Thank you.

<P>
<I>Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, Mr. Director-General, Ladies and Gentlemen,</I>
<P>
At the outset, I would like to express to all of you my sincere appreciation for the honour which you have conferred upon Thailand by unanimously electing me as President of the thirty-ninth regular session of the General Conference of the IAEA. I wish, in particular, to thank the Ambassador of Australia for proposing my candidature on behalf of the SEAP Group to which Thailand belongs and the distinguished representatives of other regional groups for supporting my candidature.
<P>
I am taking up this high office with a sense of humility. I am aware of the increasingly important role that the Agency has been called upon to assume in our rapidly changing world. I shall do my utmost to ensure the success of this Conference. I am confident that I will receive full cooperation and support from all delegations and the Secretariat in carrying out this responsibility.
<P>
May I take this opportunity, on behalf of the General Conference, to express sincere thanks and appreciation to Prof. Alec Jean Baer of Switzerland who, as President, had ably performed and led the thirty-eighth regular session of the General Conference to a successful conclusion. Being his neighbour in the Board room during the past three sessions of the Board of Governors, I have come to value his wise counsels on various issues relating to the Agency s work.
<P>
<I>Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates,</I>
<P>
The convening of the thirty-ninth regular session of the General Conference coincides with the year of the fiftieth anniversary of the dropping of the first atomic bomb.  Its devastating effect should have convinced mankind not to ever again let history repeat itself. 25 years later the NPT was born and last May the Treaty was extended indefinitely with a view to preventing nuclear proliferation, enhancing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and achieving nuclear disarmament. The world took note of the commitment made by nuclear-weapon States to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament and to conclude a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty no later than 1996.
<P>
I> Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates,</I>
<P>
Since the last General Conference, we have witnessed significant progress and developments in the Agency s activities. With regard to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, past events have demonstrated the need for IAEA safeguards system to provide credible assurances not only on declared nuclear activities but also of the absence of undeclared nuclear activities. Consequently, the work of the Agency to further strengthen the effectiveness and improve the cost-efficiency of safeguards system has been endorsed in a comprehensive set of measures in Programme 93+2. I believe distinguished delegates would join me in commending the Director-General and his staff in this regard.  With respect to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, the Agency has been the principal international instrument for promoting nuclear co-operation and the transfer of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes to developing countries. The areas of activities include: food irradiation, radiation protection, nuclear safety and radioactive waste management and the establishment of a Standing Advisory Group on Technical Assistance and Co-operations (SAGTAC). The continuation and further improvement in such activities require strong commitment by Member States in terms of adequate and predictable resources and implementation support to match the Agency s effort.
<P>
<I>Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates,</I>
<P>
My predecessor, in his last year's opening statement, said that applications of nuclear energy have transformed our world irreversibly. He also said that -- it is we who decided, under Article III of the Agency's Statute, to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world. I submit to all of you that in this post cold war era all of us should redouble our efforts to make the world a safer and better place to live in. The International Atomic Energy Agency, under the able leadership of Director-General Blix, could play a unique role not only in promoting and verifying the peaceful uses of nuclear energy but also in convincing the world at large of its positive contribution to the future of our children.
<P>
In conclusion, I make a renewed appeal for your co-operation and goodwill to ensure a successful outcome of this Conference.
<P>
Thank you.

</CENTER>
<P>
Since the last session of our General Conference, the most prominent event in nuclear non-proliferation has been the indefinite extension of the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty.
<P>
This is a success, relative maybe, but a success all the same. It has been achieved in good part thanks to the great personal qualities of the president of the Conference, but also, and this is important, thanks to efforts by many delegations and by numerous participants who had been delegated to New York by States, the population of which does not want any nuclear armaments anymore.
<P>
 Assessing the role of our Agency, the Conference has been absolutely clear. It has emphasized that the IAEA plays a critical role in the application of the safeguards written in the NPT. It has recognized the importance, for the Agency, to be given the means to accomplish its task and it has called for application of the measures decided by the Board of Governors towards a strengthening of safeguards and a better detection of undeclared activities. In other words, it has placed this Agency where it belongs, that is at the hub of nuclear non-proliferation activities.
<P>
Turning to other aspects of this Agency's work, the Conference has specifically asked that it keep looking for reliable and predictable means to finance technical cooperation. Technical cooperation however is much more than a matter of finances. Even though, in Art.III of our Statute, it comes ahead of safeguards, its importance is by far not as considerable. As part of a long-term planning for the Agency, the purpose of technical cooperation must urgently be examined in view of the results achieved so far. When we are clear about what we want, we can discuss finances. Time is of the essence, however. For twenty years now the gap between amounts pledged and targets to be reached has been increasing systematically. The Board of Governors must tackle without delay what is about to become the question of the survival of technical cooperation.
<P>
In New York, the extension of the NPT was the main topic of the Conference, however, and more than 170 non-nuclear weapons states, almost 120 of which are members of this Agency, have found it in their interest to renounce forever the acquisition of nuclear weapons. They have done it because they believe that nuclear disarmament is bound to come. They have expressed this unfaltering hope through the adoption of a text requesting nuclear-weapons states to demonstrate utmost restraint in this regard and in expectation of the signature of a Comprehensive Test-ban Treaty in 1996. In so doing, they were asking nuclear-weapons states for a small encouraging sign, in exchange for the major commitment that they have now accepted for ever. It is regrettable that two states are rebuffing this request.
<P>
The renewed nuclear weapons tests this year are deeply disappointing.
<P>
The NPT Extension Conference may be a turning point in the history of non-proliferation, however. This Conference may still be too close for us to realize all its significance, but the extension of the NPT is not an isolated occurence. It belongs to a time of renewed interest for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and for other initiatives aiming at a true and durable nuclear disarmament.
<P>
This renewed activity is not unique to non-proliferation. By contrast with over forty years of relative political stability that we have known after the Second World War, we are now in a period of rapid evolution and nobody knows yet how long it shall last or what its consequences shall be.
<P>
Nuclear non-proliferation is fast evolving.  It is obvious, however, that some are still clinging to ideas or to attitudes that might well have been acceptable thirty years ago, but that the great majority of us vigorously objects to today.  Those who cling to the past have but one alternative, a fast change of behaviour or extinction.  If history is any guide, it guarantees that most of them will go the way of the mammoths and of the dinosaurs. By contrast, those who have realized what is happening, those who are sufficiently down-to-earth to accept changes and to modify their paradigms accordingly are those who will survive. They shall define the rules of the new game. They shall make the revolution that will open another long period of stability.
<P>
Whether the IAEA wants it or not, it cannot escape this revolution. It is living through it.  Changes may not be very spectacular to the layman, but they are of a fundamental nature.  Take, for instance, the agenda for the session that we are opening this morning. You will find such topics as the strengthening of safeguards, their financing, that of technical assistance, and even amendments to Article Vl of the Statute. None of these topics is new, quite obviously.  They all smack of "deja vu", but what is new is that people are changing and attitudes are changing.
<P>
The climate of the discussions is different. A growing willingness to progress is at last in the air. There reigns a feeling that rapid improvements may be possible after all. The revolution is underway and shall not be stopped by anybody.
<P> 
If we do not wish our decisions to disappear like so many others in the obscurity of minutes of past meetings, let us forget the old thinking schemes. Let us show some enthusiasm for a novel approach to non-proliferation and let us be those who create the future rather than those who are enduring it. This future, our future, shall be built upon the lessons drawn from past mistakes and upon the hopes that we express for it to-day.

<p>{\bf Guidelines~for~Mathematics:}~~Authors can assist our processing of manuscripts if they aim to approach the NF typesetting conventions for mathematics, 
which are as follows. </p>
<p>Scalar quantities are italic, with the exception of the base of natural logarithms and $\sqrt{-1}$, which are roman: ${\rm e}$ and ${\rm i}$. The names of standard 
mathematical functions are roman, thus:</p>
<p>$\ln (\exp x ) = x$, <br>
$\sin ( \sin ^{-1} y ) = y$,<br>
${\rm d}z^2 / {\rm d}z = 2 z$. </p>
<p>Use $\exp (\ldots)$ instead of ${\rm e}^{(\ldots)}$ except in the simplest cases. Subscripts and superscripts which refer to other mathematical quantities used in 
the paper are italic; otherwise they are roman. Therefore, the Kronecker delta is $\delta_{ij}$, while the electron plasma frequency is $\omega_{\rm pe}^2 = 
n_{\rm e} e^2/m_{\rm e} \epsilon_0 $. Complicated subscripts, particularly subscripts to subscripts, should not be used. Vector quantities are bold italic 
($\bm{E}$), and tensors are sanserif bold. The nabla symbol should be used for the differential vector operators grad, div and curl (rot): $\bm{E} = \bm{\nabla} 
\phi$; $\bm{\nabla} \cdot \bm{E} = \rho / \epsilon_0$; $\bm{B} = \bm{\nabla} \times \bm{A}$. </p>
<p>NF will try to set equations in the standard two column format, splitting equations across lines if necessary. Therefore, please construct equations to make the 
decision on splitting straightforward. Often a built-up fraction or a matrix is better formed of small components defined in other equations. </p>

Cattle normally play a crucial role in rural economies of
developing countries, providing crop manure, domestic fuel and
hides, as well as meat and milk, while the bullock is the tractor
in the field and the engine of transportation. But in a wide belt
across central and southern Africa and on Zanzibar's main island
Unguja, livestock rearing is seriously hampered because the
tsetse fly spreads disease to the animals. Numerous costly
efforts to eradicate tsetse - using traps, insecticides, and
other conventional methods - have failed thus far. Now it seems
that eradication is possible, at least on isolated Zanzibar.
<P>
<I>Unguja and a few tiny satellite islands make up Zanzibar, 35
kilometres east of continental Africa. It joined the United
Republic of Tanzania in 1964. A lone fly species lives on Unguja.
Apart from it, the island has ideal conditions for cattle - lush
vegetation, gently undulating terrain, reliable and ample
rainfall. Yet some 10,000 live animals plus US$250,000 of milk
products must be imported each year to supplement the low per
capita intake of protein on Unguja.</I>
<P>
Tsetse flies (<I>Glossina</I> species) live only on blood. Some
species carry sleeping sickness to humans, others a similar
disease, <I>nagana</I>, to animals caused by single celled
organisms called trypanosomes. The single species (G.
<I>austeni</I>) on the island attacks only animals. Nagana, first
reported in Unguja early this century, has restricted and ravaged
the 1,650 square kilometre island's herds and until recently up
to 80% of the remaining cattle were infected. 
<P>
Initial efforts to eradicate the fly-using environmentally
friendly methods-began over 20 years ago with a research
programme in mainland Tanzania funded by the US Agency for
International Development. A laboratory and facilities for
mass-rearing of tsetses were introduced at Tanga. Significant
experience was gained in this effort but it eventually proved
unsustainable. Since then a series of activities on Zanzibar
involving bilateral and multilateral assistance have used
conventional methods to substantially reduce fly numbers and
contain their movement. 
<P>
Conditions thus seemed promising for eradication when the IAEA
Model Project was launched in 1994. Fly density had been
drastically reduced, in some areas to levels below detectability
by trap surveys. Re-infestation was unlikely because it is far
from the mainland. The tsetse fly reservoirs in Unguja were
mainly in three forests in the south; and a broad enough belt of
mainly rice paddies separated these from the north of the island.
New techniques developed in projects against other pest insects,
such as aerial release, could be introduced on Zanzibar.
<P>
The IAEA Model Project is relying on SIT, the Sterile Insect
Technique, to mass-rear and release sterilized male flies in
sufficient numbers to challenge the fertile wild males as mates
for the wild females. SIT is well advanced and has been
effectively used against fruitflies in both North and South
America. But its application against other insects, such as the
tsetse, is an innovation being fostered in the Technical
Co-operation Programme with the support of the Joint FAO/IAEA
Division.
<P>
After just two years of sterile male releases, females routinely
caught in the wild already show a high ratio of infertility,
expected to reach 65% in the first quarter of this year. Major
advances are being made (<A HREF="sitbox.htm">see box</A>) in
rearing and sex
identification systems. To promote the approach the IAEA convened
a four-week SIT training course/seminar in Unguja late in 1995
for scientists from other African countries affected by tsetse.
<P>
The Agency first got involved in helping Zanzibar back in 1983
with the training of Tanzanian scientists at IAEA's Seibersdorf
laboratory in mass rearing the Unguja tsetse species, using a
<I>membrane</I> feeding technique developed there. Facilities in
Tanga were systematically improved and extended so that by the
end of 1995, with a colony of 400,000 females, it housed the
world's largest tsetse production system. The colony will soon be
500,000, allowing for the release of 50,000 (60,000 with back-up
from Seibersdorf) sterile males each week. Thanks to the support
of several donors, the project is well on its way toward a
successful conclusion.
<P>
To rebuild Zanzibar's herds of mixed livestock, family based
farming is now being expanded. Farmers in areas that were until
recently infested now have the opportunity to obtain cattle
through a government programme offering very attractive loans.
Government initiatives to inspire family-based herds, in a
sustainable and environmental friendly manner, are based on the
very real prospect of the tsetse being eradicated by the end of
the IAEA Model Project in 1997. 
<P>
SIT will be deployed throughout Unguja. But the early focus has
been on the southern forest pockets - Jozani, Central Muyuni and
Coastal Muyuni - which are inaccessible to other techniques.
Therefore, since September 1994 sterile male releases have been
exclusively by air. Experience, in Zimbabwe and elsewhere, shows
insecticide spraying by air is often ineffective and hazardous.
But the 30 milligram flies are not blown off-target by light
winds and thermal currents, so the aircraft can fly at a safe
height above the forest canopy, and effective air drops can be
made throughout the day instead of only at night when the ground
gets cool.
<P>
National authorities have provided scientists, technicians,
infrastructure, as well as cash to the project; they also
integrated it with national development plans so that its
benefits reach those who will use the tsetse-free land. The
Zanzibar programme is developing an integrated smallholder farm
system, with help from the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD), to ensure that farm families are the
principal beneficiaries and that freed land is used sustainably.

<P>
The IAEA Yearbook 1995 concentrates on developments in nuclear
science and technology and on the work of the IAEA during the
previous year, but it also records major events which took place
during the early months of the current year. One such event was
the holding in New York of the Review and Extension Conference of
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The
outcome of the conference was the extension, for an indefinite
period, of the treaty and hence, in particular, of the
obligations of the IAEA in the sphere of safeguards -- the system
of international inspection for verifying the exclusively
peaceful uses of nuclear energy. A background is provided in this
year's lead article.
<P>
Further details regarding recent changes and future developments
in IAEA safeguards are given in Part E of the Yearbook: the steps
already undertaken and the measures being implemented to improve
the cost effectiveness of safeguards and to increase the
assurance of the completeness of information on nuclear
activities in States which have undertaken not to acquire nuclear
weapons; and the new verification roles that the IAEA may be
called upon to play in support of international nuclear arms
control agreements.
<P>         
Article IV of the NPT recalls the right of all countries to have
access to the benefits of nuclear science and technology. The
IAEA has, since its inception, been engaged in the transfer of
knowledge and expertise in these areas. The introduction to Part
A of the Yearbook describes some of the new approaches now being
undertaken to ensure that these technology transfer activities
bring lasting benefit to end users as the concept of 'partnership
in development' is introduced. The accompanying article describes
the history of a particular aspect of the programme -- the
training courses organized over the past twenty years in the
areas of nuclear power and safety.
<P>            
The Statute of the IAEA defines one of its functions as being "to
encourage and assist research on, and development and practical
application of, atomic energy for peaceful uses throughout the
world." Part B of the Yearbook describes just a few of the IAEA
activities in this area: the use of nuclear techniques to help
maintain a cleaner environment, methods for improving animal
production and the use of research reactors for the production of
radioisotopes and for education and training purposes.
<P>         
Part C of the Yearbook as usual deals with the status and trends
in nuclear power, the nuclear fuel cycle and radioactive waste
management throughout the world, together with details of the
IAEA programmes in these areas. While there have been no
fundamental changes in the worldwide development of nuclear power
in recent years, its growth in southeast Asia has continued. It
is clear overall that nuclear power offers a viable option that
needs to be carefully considered in a situation where there is
increasing anxiety about the environmental problems caused by the
burning of fossil fuels.
<P>         
In the area of nuclear safety, the most significant developments
in 1994 were the opening for signature of the international
Convention on Nuclear Safety and the publication of the new
International Basic Safety Standards for Protection Against
Ionizing Radiation andfor the Safety of Radiation Sources. Both
of these events are described in Part D of the Yearbook, which
this year is issued in a new format concentrating on selected
topics of special interest. These range from the work being done
to ensure the integrity of nuclear power reactor steam generators
to the latest results on the mechanisms and genetics of tumour
induction.
<P>         
Finally, Part F once again provides reference material on the
structure and organization of the IAEA and its relationship with
its Member States.
<P>         
The celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations
has focused renewed attention on the need for an effective and
efficient international system which is capable of meeting the
challenges of a changing agenda. The IAEA is well prepared, on
its part, to respond to such challenges and its programme
continues to evolve to take account of the new requirements of
its Member States. In this spirit, we are already looking ahead
and planning for the year 2000 and beyond.

18th CONSULTATIVE MEETING OF CONTRACTING PARTIES TO THE CONVENTION ON THE PREVENTION OF MARINE POLLUTION BY DUMPING OF WASTES AND OTHER MATTER, 1972: 4-8 DECEMBER 1995</I></B>
</SMALL>
<P>
<H3>Draft protocol to London Convention ready for conference</H3>
<SMALL><I>From the IMO News, published by the International Maritime Organization</I></SMALL>
</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A Special Meeting of Contracting Parties to the Convention on the Prevention of Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972 (the London Convention or LC), will be held at IMO headquarters from 28 October to 8 November to consider and adopt a protocol to the Convention.
<P>
The draft protocol was finalized at the 18th Consultative Meeting of Contracting Parties in December 1995. It is expected that the protocol will be the biggest change to the Convention since its adoption in 1972 and will represent a major change of direction that reflects the changes in attitudes towards marine waste disposal that have taken place in recent years.
<P>
The decision to include the changes in a protocol rather than simple amendments was made because the proposed changes are so extensive that they will, if adopted, amount to a virtual re-writing of the Convention. The protocol will supersede the original 1972 Convention.
<P>
The 18<SUP>th</SUP> Consultative Meeting agreed in principle that Parties, according to their scientific, technical and economic capabilities, should not only aim at prevention, but also at the reduction and, where practicable, elimination of pollution of the sea caused by dumping and incineration at sea.
<P>
It is believed that some will regard this as support for a limit to be placed on dumping activities altogether while others may see it as a way of opening the door for remedial action for dumping activities in the past.
<P>
The Meeting agreed that a precautionary approach to environmental protection from dumping and incineration at sea needed to be included in the protocol as a basic provision. The draft Article 111 states that Contracting Parties shall be "guided by" or "apply": <I>"a precautionary approach to environmental protection from disposal and incineration of wastes and other matter at sea whereby appropriate preventative measures are taken when there is reason to believe that substances
or energy introduced in the marine environment are likely to cause harm even when there is no conclusive evidence to prove a causal relation between inputs and their effects."</I> The final wording will be decided by the Special Meeting.
<P>
The Contracting Parties also acknowledged the usefulness of the "polluter-pays principle (PPP)" as a cost-allocation instrument when implementing the protocol, although the proposed text only amounts to a declaration of intent to apply PPP and is only confined to costs involved with issuance of permits and with enforcement of permit conditions.
<P>
The protocol could also involve acceptance of "reverse listing" instead of "black and grey lists". This means that all dumping would be strictly prohibited, with the exception of clearly identified waste categories. This concept is already incorporated into the regional context, such as the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area, 1974 (Helsinki Convention), the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft, 1972 (Oslo Convention) and the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-based Sources, 1974 (Paris Convention).
<P>
It was agreed that the area to which the Convention applies should be extended to include the "sea-bed and the sub-soil thereof". The Meeting agreed not to include internal marine waters under the definition of "sea".
<P>
It is expected that a Waste Assessment Framework will be included as an annex to the Convention. The Waste Assessment Framework is a practical and comprehensive procedure for managing waste in compliance with the Convention.
<P>
The draft text recognizes the importance of other international treaties, notably the Convention on the Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, 1989 (The Basel Convention). It proposes that Parties "shall not permit the export of wastes or other matter to other countries for dumping or incineration at sea".
<P>
The Consultative Meeting came to broad agreement on the need to strengthen implementation, compliance and enforcement provisions as a whole, which has the potential to boost the credibility of the Convention as an effective instrument to protect the marine environment.
<P>
There was also agreement to a substantial strengthening of the Convention's technical co-operation provisions, giving incentives to developing countries and countries in transition to market economies for access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and know-how and also involving clearinghouse activities by IMO.
<P>
The draft text offers a so-called period of grace of 5 years to new Parties to the protocol to achieve full compliance with specific provisions in the protocol, based on established needs. This period would involve close monitoring on one hand, but would also give an incentive to provide dedicated technical assistance to the new Party concerned.
<P>
The Consultative Meeting agreed to include the Settlement of Disputes Arrangements, which were accepted in 1978 but which have never entered into force.
<P>
Although entry into force provisions will be decided by the Conference, the Consultative Meeting agreed that the number of ratifications required should be relatively low - the figures suggested were 10 to 15.
<P>
A Technical Co-operation and Assistance Programme is being developed under the Convention to be incorporated into the IMO Integrated Technical Co-operation Programme as a tool to implement the strengthened technical co-operation provisions contained in the draft protocol.
<P>
If accepted, this Programme may involve more commitment from Contracting Parties on a bilateral or multilateral basis to provide assistance and additional input from IMO with regard to project identification, planning and development, and the submission of project proposals to Contracting Parties, donor agencies, etc.

Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America

<P>       
<I>Preamble</I>
<P>
In the name of their peoples and faithfully interpreting their
desires and aspirations, the Governments of the States which have
signed the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin
America,
<P>
<I>Desiring</I> to contribute, so far as lies in their power,
towards ending the armaments race, especially in the field of
nuclear weapons, and towards strengthening a world at peace,
based on the sovereign equality of States, mutual respect and
good neighbourliness, 
<P>
<I>Recalling</I> that the United Nations General
Assembly, in its resolution 808 (IX), adopted unanimously as one
of the three points of a co-ordinated programme of disarmament
"the total prohibition of the use and manufacture of nuclear
weapons and weapons of mass destruction of every type";
<P>
<I>Recalling</I> that militarily denuclearized zones are not an
end in themselves but rather a means for achieving general and
complete disarmament at a later stage,
<P>
<I>Recalling</I> United Nations General Assembly resolution 1911
(XVIII), which established that the measures that should be
agreed upon for the denuclearization of Latin America should be
taken "in the light of the principles of the Charter of the
United Nations and of regional agreements",
<P>
<I>Recalling</I> United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2028
(XX) which established the principle of an acceptable balance of
mutual responsibilities and duties for the nuclear and
non-nuclear powers, and
<P>
<I>Recalling</I> that the Charter of the Organization of American
States proclaims that it is an essential purpose of the
organization to strengthen the peace and security of the
hemisphere,
       

<P>
<I>Convinced:</I>
<P>
That the incalculable destructive power of nuclear weapons has
made it imperative that the legal prohibition of war should be
strictly observed in practice if the survival civilization and
the survival of mankind itself is to be assured,
<P>
That nuclear weapons, whose terrible effects are suffered,
indiscriminately and inexorably, by military forces and civilian
population alike, constitute, through the persistence of the
radioactivity they release, an attack on the integrity of the
human species and ultimately, may even render the whole
earth uninhabitable,
<P>
That general and complete disarmament under effective
international control is a vital matter which all the peoples of
the world equally demand,
<P>
That the proliferation of nuclear weapons, which seems
inevitable unless States, in the exercise of their sovereign
rights, impose restrictions on themselves in order to prevent it,
would make any agreement on disarmament  enormously difficult
and would increase the danger of the outbreak of a
nuclear conflagration, 
<P>
That the establishment of militarily
denuclearized zones is closely linked with the maintenance of
peace and security in the respective regions, 
<P>
That the military denuclearization of vast geographical zones,
adopted by the sovereign decision of the States comprised
therein, will exercise a beneficial influence on other regions
there similar conditions exist, 
<P>
That the privileged situation of the signatory States,

upon their the inescapable duty of preserving that situation both
in their own interests and for the good of mankind,
<P>
That the existence of nuclear weapons in any country of Latin
America would make it a target for possible nuclear attacks and
would inevitably set off, throughout the region a ruinous race in
nuclear weapons which would involve the unjustifiable diversion,
for warlike purposes, of the resources required for economic and
social development,
<P>
That the foregoing reasons, together with the traditional
peace-loving outlook of Latin America, give rise to an
inescapable necessity that nuclear energy should be used in that
region exclusively for peaceful purposes, and that the Latin
American countries should use their right to the greatest and
most equitable possible access to this new source of energy in
order to expedite the economic and social development of their
peoples,
<P>
<I>Convinced finally:</I>
<P>
That the military denuclearization of Latin America - being
understood to mean the undertaking entered into internationally
in this Treaty to keep their territories forever free from
nuclear weapons - will constitute a measure which will spare
their peoples from the squandering of their limited resources on
nuclear armaments and will protect them against possible nuclear
attacks on their territories, and will also constitute a
significant contribution towards preventing the proliferation of
nuclear weapons and a powerful factor for general and complete
disarmament, and
<P>
That Latin America, faithful to its tradition of universality,
must not only endeavour to banish from its homelands the scourge
of a nuclear war, but must also strive to promote the well-being
and advancement of its peoples, at the same time co-operating in
the fulfillment of the ideals of mankind,
that is to say, in the consolidation of a permanent peace based
on equal rights, economic fairness and social justice for all, in
accordance with the principles and purposes set forth in the

<H3>The Incident Reporting System (IRS) for Nuclear Power Plants</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>        
<OL>        
<B>Background</B>
<P>
<LI>The IRS, which is jointly operated by the Agency and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (NEA/OECD), collects, evaluates and disseminates information on safety-relevant incidents at operating nuclear power plants and systematically analyses the safety implications of the incidents. Designed to be a simple but effective vehicle for the exchange of such information among the participating countries, the IRS has evolved into an efficient tool for the feedback of operational safety experience.
<P>
<LI>Ukraine, China, Mexico and Romania recently began participating in the IRS, bringing the number of participants to 29 (1), and there are ten countries with emerging nuclear power programmes which are regarded as potential participants.
<P>
<B>Reporting to the IRS</B>
<P>
<LI>During the one-year period ending June 1995, one hundred IRS reports were received by the Agency's Secretariat. Also, earlier incident reports in an NEA/OECD database were in October 1994 added to the Agency database of IRS reports, which now contains some 2000 reports with a wide spectrum of lessons learned.
<P>
<LI>In those reports, the categories used most frequently in classifying the root causes of the reported incidents are "human factors" (74%), "mechanical failure" (13 %) and "electrical failure" (3%).
<P>
<LI> At their 1994 annual meeting, held in Vienna in October, IRS National Co-ordinators expressed concern about a decline in reporting to the IRS. Various aspects of the problem (for example, unclear reporting criteria and failure to distinguish between the purpose of the IRS and that of the International Nuclear Event Scale) were considered, but the main reason for the decline was widely felt to be insufficiency of the resources (human and financial) devoted to reporting. The IRS National Co-ordinators recommended that the Secretariats of the Agency and NEA/OECD look into the problem.
<P>
<B>The Advanced Incident Reporting System (AIRS) database</B>
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat has developed a computerized system (AIRS) for the preparation, storage, dissemination, querying and retrieval of reports (full texts, illustrations and annotations) submitted to the IRS. The initial distribution of the AIRS database (on CD-ROM) is planned for the first quarter of 1996. It is hoped that the AIRS database will help nuclear safety experts to draw conclusions from the collected reports describing and categorizing significant events which have occurred at nuclear power plants over the years.
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat is holding a training workshop in Vienna from 9 to 13 October 1995 for potential users of the AIRS database.
<P>
<B>The analysis of IRS reports and related activities</B>
<P>
<LI>The IRS can contribute to a greater awareness of actual and potential safety problems.  On one hand, the analysis of an IRS report relating to a particular incident at a particular plant may yield insights of value to the operators of similar plants. On the other, the analysis of a number of IRS reports all relating to the same kind of incident may yield insights of broader interest, such as insights about safety during low-power operation and shutdown and about possible incidents after plant upgrades and other modifications - issues which have been the subject of recent IRS-based studies (reported on in internal documents IAEA-J4-CS-14/95 and IAEA-J4-CS-23/95, copies of which are available on request). 
<P> 
<LI>In order to promote a better understanding of the incidents reported to the IRS and of possible actions to prevent a recurrence, the Secretariat has produced a compendium of actions taken in response to reported incidents (internal document IAEA-J4-CS-99/94).
<P>
<LI>In the interests of reducing the number of safety-relevant events during nuclear power plant operation, the Secretariat is developing Safety Practices documents on (i) the reporting of "human-dominated" incidents at nuclear power plants to the IRS; (ii) identification of the causes of incidents reported to the IRS; and (iii) operational safety experience feedback based on the use of IRS reports.
<P>
<B>Joint NEA/OECD-Agency meeting</B>
<P>
<LI>A joint NEA/OECD-Agency meeting on the exchange of information about recent events at nuclear power plants was held (together with the 1995 meeting of IRS National Co-ordinators) in Vera Cruz, Mexico, from 29 May to 2 June 1995; it was hosted by the Mexican Comision Nacional de Seguridad Nuclear y Salvaguardias. Additional topics discussed at the meeting were (i) operational safety experience feedback and (ii) how the IRS can best serve the needs of Latin American countries.

<H3>Safety Principles for Future Nuclear Power Reactors</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>        
<OL>        
<B>Background</B>
<P>
<LI>Annex 8 to document GC(XXXVIII)/INF/6, which was before the General Conference last year, gave a brief account of work being done on the preparation of an IAEA-TECDOC entitled "Development of safety principles for the design of future nuclear power plants".  Below is a brief account of work done since the General Conference's 1994 session.  Developments since the 1994 session of the Conference
<P>
<LI>In October and November 1994, consultants reviewed the comments received from experts in Member States on the current version of the draft IAEA-TECDOC "Development of safety principles for the design of future nuclear power plants" and produced a final draft, which was issued in June 1995 as IAEA-TECDOC-801.
<P>
<LI>At meetings held late in 1994 and early in 1995, INSAG agreed that its document "Basic safety principles for nuclear power plants" (INSAG-3) needed to be revised. A draft revised version of document INSAG-3, based to some extent on the material subsequently issued in IAEA-TECDOC-801, was prepared and discussed by INSAG in July 1995, and a new draft is being prepared on the basis of the comments made at the INSAG meeting for consideration by INSAG at a future meeting.
<P>
<LI>In May-June 1995, a Technical Committee considering the approaches to future nuclear power plant safety which have been developed in different countries expressed appreciation of the Agency's activities in promoting the formulation of safety objectives and principles and an exchange of information among Member States regarding those approaches.  It urged the Agency to continue the activities in question, with the focus on:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the views of utilities, regulatory authorities and designers in different countries regarding safety objectives and design approaches (and especially areas of agreement and divergence);
<P>
<LI>international harmonization of the safety objectives and principles which may influence the general safety of future nuclear power plants; and
<P>
<LI>co-ordination in seeking a greater degree of international consensus on which severe accidents should be addressed in the design of future nuclear power plants.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>The draft of an IAEA-TECDOC on approaches to the safety of future nuclear power plants has been prepared on the basis of the presentations which were made and the discussions which took place during the Technical Committee's meeting, the key issues being: national approaches to the safety of future nuclear power plants; the harmonization of national approaches through international co-operation; attributes of importance for the safety of future nuclear power plants; and other areas where harmonization is necessary.

<H3>The Exchange of Scientific and Technical Information </H3>
<I>(Excerpt from a General Conference document.)</I>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Background </B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The Agency is mandated by its Statute to foster the exchange of scientific and technical information among its Member States. The exchange of such information entails two distinct activities: (i) the provision of opportunities for experts to meet for purposes of information exchange and (ii) the collation and dissemination of information. 
<P>
<LI>In the safety area, the Agency has been fostering the exchange of scientific and technical information through: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the organization of major international meetings (conferences, symposia and seminars), many of them co-sponsored by other international organizations, and subsequent dissemination of the information exchanged at the meetings through - primarily - published proceedings; 
<P>
<LI>the organization of specialized meetings of groups of experts (Technical Committee meetings) and subsequent dissemination of the information exchanged at the meetings through, for example, technical documents (IAEA-TECDOCs) and technical reports; and 
<P>
<LI>the preparation of an annual Nuclear Safety Review. 
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Recent developments </B>
</CENTER>
<P>          
<LI>The Agency, whose conferences and symposia have largely been paper presentation meetings, recently tried out a new conference format: its <A HREF=/worldatom/inforesource/bulletin/bull372/radiationc.html>"International Conference on Radiation, Health and Society: Comprehending Radiation Risks"</A>, held in Paris in October 1994, was organized essentially as a discussion meeting and provided ample opportunity for information exchange among the participants, who generally welcomed the new format. 
<P>
<LI>A subject on which the Agency has been involved in an intensive exchange of scientific and technical information is the health and environmental effects of the Chernobyl accident, about which there are still widely differing views. Together with the European Commission and WHO, the Agency is sponsoring an international conference entitled <A HREF=/worldatom/thisweek/preview/chernobyl.html>"One Decade after Chernobyl: Summing up the Radiological Consequences of the Accident"</A> and organized in co-operation with the United Nations (Department of Humanitarian Affairs), UNESCO and UNEP. The conference, at which a common and conclusive understanding   of the nature and magnitude of the accident's consequences will be sought, is to take place in Vienna from 8 to 12 April 1996. 
<P>
<LI> A subject on which the Agency has recently initiated an exchange of scientific and technical information is the practical application of the International Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources. An Agency seminar relating to this subject and to experience in applying the 1990 recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection is to take place in Vienna from 20 to 24 November 1995. 
<P>
<LI>During 1994-95, scientific and technical information exchange through specialized meetings continued, much of the information in question being subsequently disseminated by different IAEA-TECDOCs. The titles of recent safety-related IAEA-TECDOCs are listed opposite. 
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Outlook </B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The large number of meetings organized to foster the exchange of information on nuclear and radiation safety has been a considerable burden for Member States providing experts as participants in such meetings. In order to reduce the burden while ensuring that the information exchange continues on a regular and systematic basis, it is proposed that in future a major discussion conference on nuclear and radiation safety be held once every year, possibly together with parallel meetings on special topics. Ad hoc Technical Committees will continue to deal with special topics of interest only to small numbers of Member States. At the same time, support for the organization of regional conferences, symposia and seminars in developing Member States will be provided. 
<P>
<LI>In addition to the annual "Nuclear Safety Review", the Secretariat will continue to produce reports on radiological accidents considered by it to be of interest to Member States. 
<P>
<LI>Servicing of the Convention on Nuclear Safety when it enters into force (see in this connection Part E of the present document) will mean additional information exchange activities, such as the transmission to the Contracting Parties of information received in accordance with the provisions of the Convention and the distribution of reports resulting from meetings of the Contracting Parties. 
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat intends to explore the possibilities of various network systems (e.g. Internet) as a vehicle for fostering the exchange of scientific and technical information with Member States, one objective being to give Member States - and especially those which are developing countries - direct access to a central nuclear and radiation safety database.

<LI>The two missions scheduled for 1995 within the framework of the IRRT service (1), one to the Czech Republic and one to Romania, have been postponed at the request of the Member States concerned.
<P>         
<LI>Following discussions with a number of regulatory bodies, the Secretariat plans to expand the "Guidelines for IAEA International Regulatory Review Teams (IRRTs)", IAEA- TECDOC-703, through the inclusion of four areas (research reactors, waste management, radiation protection and decommissioning) in addition to the nine which may currently be considered by IRRTs. A group of consultants will later this year prepare draft supplementary guidance relating to those four areas.
<P>
<LI>Following an IRRT mission to Romania scheduled for the first half of 1996, the Guidelines will be revised in the light of the experience gained through IRRT missions, with incorporation of the new supplementary guidance.

<H3>The Operational Safety Review Team (OSART) Services</H3>
<I>(Excerpt from a General Conference document.)</I>
<P>
 <HR>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The OSART service was inaugurated in 1982 to provide advice and assistance to Member States in enhancing the operational safety of nuclear power plants. The members of OSARTs are technical experts from Member States, most being senior, experienced personnel from operating nuclear power plants. OSART reviews, which are available to all countries with nuclear power programmes, are carried out through missions of three basic types: missions to operating reactors (OSART missions); missions to reactors under construction or at the pre-commissioning stage (Pre-OSART missions); and Technical Exchange missions, which cover a limited range of topics or differ in some other way from missions of the other two types. When design reviews are also involved, the missions are known as "Safety Review missions".
<P>
<LI>The Agency is able to conduct up to ten missions of different types a year, and by the end of July 1995 a total of 79 missions and 31 follow-up visits to 69 nuclear power plants in 28 countries had been completed (see the <A HREF=gc39infc1.html>table</A> at the end of this Annex). All but three Member States with operating nuclear power plants have received OSART missions.
<P>
<LI>OSART reviews are concerned with management practices, operational programmes and the performance of plant equipment and personnel rather than with plant design.  Normally, eight areas (management, organization and administration; training and qualification; operations; maintenance; technical support; radiation protection; chemistry; and emergency planning and preparedness) are reviewed over a period of three weeks at the nuclear power plant. The areas covered during Pre-OSART missions are normally: commissioning; project management; civil engineering and construction; mechanical equipment installation; electrical and I&C equipment installation; and quality assurance in construction and commissioning.
<P>
<LI>OSARTs do not attempt to assess overall plant safety or to compare the safety performance of different plants. Rather, they aim to provide the plant operator and the Member State with recommendations and suggestions for strengthening safety performance and to identify good practices that might usefully be followed at other plants. In the formulation of its findings, each OSART draws on guidelines derived from the best international operational safety standards and practices (issued in IAEA-TECDOC-744), on the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group's report on "Safety Culture" (published as Safety Series No. 75-INSAG-4) and on the experience of the individual OSART members
<P>
<LI>The results of OSART missions and follow-up visits are entered into the OSART database (see paras 8 and 9 below) and summarized in the annual Nuclear Safety Review.  In addition, they are being disseminated in IAEA-TECDOCs (see "OSART mission highlights 1991-1992", IAEA-TECDOC-797, May 1995).
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Programme development</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>On the basis of the experience gained by Agency staff members in operating the OSART service and of advice received in December 1994 from a group of nuclear industry consultants, the Secretariat plans to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>place greater emphasis on review skills (as a complement to technical and managerial skills) and English language capability when selecting OSART members;
<P>
<LI>increase the duration of the training in review skills provided for OSART members from 3.5 hours to about 12 hours; simplify and clarify the guidance for the conduct of missions;
<P>
<LI>call for increased work observation by OSARTs (as opposed to discussions based on plant documentation) as a means of identifying worthwhile safety performance improvement opportunities;
<P>
<LI>call for a reduction in the amount of descriptive information in mission reports that is not related to safety performance improvement opportunities or to good practices;
<P>
<LI>examine mission results with a view to ensuring that they reflect an international perspective and will clearly benefit the host plant; and
<P>
<LI>focus follow-up visits on the most significant mission results (recommendations), allowing more latitude for host plant operators to react to suggestions as they see fit.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>In addition, the Secretariat is considering how best to use OSART experience in assisting Member States with the self-assessments that may be needed in connection with implementation of the Convention on Nuclear Safety.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>OSART database</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat has established a database of OSART mission results (OSMIR) covering all missions (and follow-up visits) since January 1991.(1) The database is being updated as each mission's results are agreed, and it will ultimately contain at any given time the results of the missions carried out during the preceding five-year period.
<P>
<LI>At the end of June 1995, the database contained the results of 27 missions and 12 follow-up visits. The information in the database consists of:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>background information (details of plant - name, country, reactor type and size; dates of mission; type of mission; etc.);
<P>
<LI>mission results (currently over 1500 recommendations and 1000 suggestions for enhancing safety performance and about 500 identified "strengths", which are categorized by review area and according to significance - whether or not the result is of generic interest;
<P>
<LI>follow-up visit results, with a description of planned or completed remedial actions pursuant to all mission recommendations and suggestions and with Agency experts' comments.
</UL>
</OL>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Footnote:</B>
<P>
1 .The database, which should be of particular interest to plant operators, utilities, regulators and relevant research institutes in Member States, will be made available on request.

<H3>The International Peer Review Service for Probabilistic Safety Assessments (IPERS-PSA)</H3>
<I>(Excerpt from a General Conference document.)</I>

<HR>        
<P>        
<B>Background</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>         
<LI>Under the International Peer Review Service for Probabilistic Safety Assessments (IPERS-PSA) programme, initiated in 1988, international expert teams carry out independent reviews of PSAs being conducted in Member States.
<P>
<LI>The reviews are carried out, in response to requests from Member States, by carefully selected teams of experts who have in-depth experience in the required PSA field and are independent of the organizations which are performing or requested the PSA. The guidelines serving as a basis for the reviews (contained in IAEA-TECDOC-543) have recently been revised in the light of the experience gained in past reviews; the revised guidelines are being prepared for publication.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Focus of reviews</B>
</CENTER> <P>
<LI>Since the 1994 session of the General Conference, which had a report on the IPERS-PSA programme in Attachment 6 to Annex 2 to document GC(XXXVIII)/INF/6, there have been (as of the end of July 1995) six IPERS-PSA missions and one IPERS-PSA workshop (held in Vienna). The missions were requested by Romania (two missions), Bulgaria, the Slovak Republic, the Czech Republic and Ukraine.(1)
<P>
<LI>The reviews focused on ensuring the reliability of Level 1 PSAs (2) to be used in the identification of safety issues and in support of backfitting and other plant improvement decisions.
<P>
<LI>The experience regarding the modelling of human actions which was gained through these reviews, and particularly actions carried out by plant staff who are well trained and knowledgeable but do not have detailed written procedures to which they can refer, indicated that more weight should be given to human actions so as to ensure (i) that the PSA is carried out consistently, (ii) that the methods used correspond to the current state-of-the-art and (iii) that conditions at the plant are depicted as accurately as possible in the PSA.
<P>
<LI>Also, it was found that the modelling of computerized control systems - as was done, for example, in the case of the Temelin PSA - still represents a major challenge for PSA techniques; a PSA with a refined and detailed model of the computerized control systems is an important step towards the acceptance of such systems, and close interaction between the designers of the systems and the PSA team members is essential.
<P>
<LI>All the reviewed PSAs were conducted by local teams with the participation of plant staff, and they were actively supported by the utilities and the plant operators. That ensured maximum utilization of the insights, information and experience acquired through the PSAs and facilitated the collection and evaluation of plant-specific experience data.

<P>
(2) A Level I PSA represents the first step of a PSA. It covers initiating events, plant responses and accident sequences - including core damage.

<H3>The Integrated Safety Assessment of Research Reactors (INSARR) Service</H3>
<I>(Excerpt from a General Conference document.)</I>
<P>
 <HR>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>In 1972, the Agency began to assess the safety of research reactors in Member States by means of INSARR-type missions, both pursuant to its statutory rights and responsibilities under project and supply agreements and in response to requests from Member States.  In 1987, it launched the INSARR service on the basis of the experience thus gained.
<P>
<LI>As of the end of July 1995, a total of 123 assessments had been conducted at operating research reactors in 37 Member States, in 23 of them pursuant to project or supply agreements with the Agency (see the <A HREF=gc39infc5.html>table</A> at the end of the Annex).
<P>
<LI>The assessments address mainly the general operational safety of research reactor facilities. Upon request, they may also address a variety of specific issues such as seismic conditions, the obsolescence of equipment and documentation, the ageing of equipment, major modifications, licensing, commissioning and decommissioning.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>INSARR missions</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>INSARR missions are carried out by teams normally consisting of two to five members- experts from Member States and Agency staff. The teams carry out comprehensive, independent assessments of research reactor facilities in the light of the relevant Agency safety standards.(1) Also, they exchange experience with reactor personnel.  The duration of a mission depends on its objective and scope; a mission may last as little as three working days (at the site) if sufficient information is provided in advance.
<P>
<LI>The information required for the assessments relates to nuclear safety and radiation protection aspects of the operation of the reactor, and it is obtained from the operating organization by means of a questionnaire. Among the areas normally covered are:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a) the safety documentation, including the safety analysis report (checks for updating and conformity with Agency guidelines);
<P>
<DD>(b) the quality assurance programme (with the focus on procedures and record-keeping);
<P>
<DD>(c) the conduct of operations, including operating procedures, the maintenance programme and modifications;
<P>
<DD>(d) personnel training and qualification;
<P>
<DD>(e) the radiation protection programme, including dose records, waste management, and emergency planning and preparedness;
<P>
<DD>(f) the organizational arrangements as regards safe reactor operation; and
<P>
<DD>(g) the structure of the administrative organization set up by the Member State for dealing with safety matters, with the focus on the national licensing process, including evaluation procedures, inspections and supervisory examinations.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>At the site, the team:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a) examines the safety documentation of the reactor facility;
<P>
<DD>(b) reviews the operational status of the reactor, if possible observing operations such as start-up and shutdown; and
<P>
<DD>(c) discusses technical details with the responsible personnel.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>At the end of the mission, the team conveys its preliminary conclusions and recommendations to the relevant authorities (the operating organization and the regulatory body) at a final meeting. Subsequently, a mission report is submitted through official channels to the Member State concerned.
<P>
<LI>INSARR missions are an Agency service normally provided cost-free to those Member States which are developing countries. The question of payment for INSARR missions requested by Member States which are not developing countries and for special INSARR missions dealing with issues other than the ones normally dealt with is settled on a case-by-case basis with the requesting Member State.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>INSARR mission findings</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>In the course of the missions carried out by them, INSARR teams have found strong and weak points. Among the weak points found have been: poor documentation; documentation not properly updated; the lack of a quality assurance programme; poor implementation of the quality assurance programme; incomplete written procedures for operations, maintenance, testing, inspection, emergencies and radiation protection; and poor record-keeping. In a few extreme cases (e.g. safety systems not working properly), the mission report to the Member State has been followed by a written request from the Agency that the INSARR team's recommendations be implemented and by a further mission to check on their implementation.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Technical assistance missions</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>In addition to the INSARR missions described above, there have been several missions for the purpose of helping Member States with the licensing review of safety analysis reports for new reactors and with the commissioning of new reactors. Such missions are carried out within the framework of the Agency's technical co-operation programme.  Two such missions were conducted in 1995 - to Ghana and to Egypt.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Publication of new Safety Guides</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>Two new Safety Guides relating to research reactors were published in December 1994: "Safety Assessment of Research Reactors and Preparation of the Safety Analysis Report" (Safety Series No. 35-Gl) and "Safety in the Utilization and Modification of Research Reactors" (Safety Series No. 35-G2).

<P>
3. Since the 1994 session of the General Conference, there have been (as of the end of July 1995) 14 ASSET missions: 3 analysis missions and 11 training missions. The analysis missions were requested by Bulgaria, Ukraine and Hungary, and the training missions by South Africa, the Czech Republic (2 missions), Hungary (2), Pakistan, China, the Russian Federation (2), Sweden and Bulgaria.
<P>         
4. Also, within the framework of the ASSET service a three-week regional training course on "Operational Safety Assessment Techniques" organized by the Agency in co-operation with the Spanish Government was held at the Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas, Medioambentales y Tecnologicas (Centre for Energy, Environmental and Technological Research - CIEMAT) in Madrid and a three-week interregional training course on "Assessment Techniques for Operational Safety of Nuclear Power Plants" organized by the Agency in co-operation with the Government of the United States was held at Argonne National Laboratory. (1)
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Development of the ASSET service since the 1994 session of the General Conference</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
5. Pursuant to recommendations made at the 1994 annual meeting of users of the ASSET service, two new options have been developed:
<DL>        
<DT>Peer reviews of self-assessments of safety performance
<DD>This option may prove to be of particular interest to the operators of mature nuclear power plants. The first ASSET mission of this type (to the Forsmark NPP, Sweden) is due to take place in November 1995.
<P>
<DT>Topical analyses of events reflecting safety culture issues
<DD>This option is intended to provide an international perspective on the root causes of problems connected with quality control, preventive maintenance, surveillance, feedback and corrective maintenance and on corrective actions.  The first ASSET mission of this type (to the Kursk NPP, Russia) is due to take place in September 1995, and a total of 14 have already been requested for the period July 1995-December 1997.
</DL>
<P>
6. At a workshop held in June 1995 to review the experience gained through the ASSET service and to consider ways of making the service more effective, it was recommended that the Agency's Secretariat formulate additional guidance based on the "defence-in-depth" concept for assessing the actual and potential consequences of safety problems highlighted by the recurrence of similar events.
<P>

</CENTER>
<P>         
7. Similar safety problems and root causes were identified at nuclear power plants of different design. However, the corrective actions suggested by the ASSETs were all plant-specific, complementing the defence-in-depth safety measures already taken by the plant management in each case.

<H3>The Transport Safety Advisory Review Team (TRANSART) Service</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR>        
<P>         
<OL>        
<LI>Since the 1994 session of the General Conference, at which the Conference had before it (in Attachment 13 to Annex 2 to document GC(XXXVIII)/INF/6) a brief account of the Secretariat's plans for the establishment of a Transport Safety Assessment Review Team (TRANSART) service, a Technical Committee on competent authority actions necessary for compliance with the Agency's Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials (the Transport Regulations) has reviewed the purpose and scope of the envisaged service and recommended that the emphasis be on "the provision of advice and assistance" rather than on "assessment"; consequently, "TRANSART" now stands for "Transport Safety Advisory Review Team".
<P>      
<LI>TRANSART will focus on providing advice and assistance to Member States which want support in fully implementing the Transport Regulations. Their approach will be flexible, the advice and assistance being tailored to the needs of the particular Member State.  They will advise on matters such as the role of the competent authority in establishing priorities and an appropriate regulatory framework, and they will - for example - assist in the conduct of inspections for ensuring compliance with the Transport Regulations and in evaluating the flow of radioactive materials within the Member State. Besides TRANSART missions, the Secretariat will - inter alia - arrange for experts to spend some time in Member States as "mentors", support national training programmes (for example, by helping to organize workshops - both national and regional) and arrange fellowships and scientific visits.
<P>
<LI>The next steps to be taken by the Secretariat include the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>inform Member States of the precise scope of the TRANSART service;
<P>
<LI>contact potential donor Competent Authorities in order to determine the nature and extent of the assistance which they might provide;
<P>
<LI>organize an overall programme of activities based on Member States' requests;
<P>
<LI>co-ordinate the resources available for fulfilling the requests; and
<P>
<LI>organize follow-up activities designed to ensure the long-term success of the TRANSART service .

<H3>The International Review of Irradiator Safety (IRIS) Service</H3>

<B>Background</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>        
<LI>A mechanism for the peer review of irradiation plant safety and for the sharing of safety-related knowledge among plant operators and regulatory authorities has been introduced in the light of the following considerations:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a) There have been a number of serious accidents at industrial irradiation plants, several involving fatalities. They have been analysed in order to determine the causes and see what lessons can be learned from them. From the analyses, it has been concluded that similar accidents are probably "waiting to happen" as a result of inadequate regulatory control, poor operational safety (procedures, training, maintenance), poor design of safety systems and inadequate quality assurance during construction.
<P>
<DD>(b) Of the approximately 160 known large gamma irradiation plants, some 40 were established with Agency assistance. They contain gamma-emitting radionuclide sources and are used mainly for the sterilization of medical products and the preservation of foodstuffs. From information obtained through RAPAT missions and in other ways, it seems that at some irradiation plants - including some which were established with Agency assistance - the radiation safety conditions are poor.
</DL>
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Developments since the 1994 session of the General Conference</B>
</CENTER>
<P>         
<LI>Since the 1994 session of the General Conference, the Secretariat has, in some cases in consultation with manufacturers and other experts,
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a) drafted a Safety Practices document on lessons learned from accidents with irradiation facilities,
<P>
<DD>(b) drawn up an inventory of large "panoramic" (1) gamma irradiators (the most important ones from the safety point of view), (2)
<P>
<DD>(c) prepared a checklist of safety issues for use by the regulatory authorities in Member States,
<P>
<DD>(d) prepared a checklist of safety issues for organizations operating irradiation facilities,
<P>
<DD>(e) initiated a survey of the safety status of gamma irradiation facilities worldwide, with the emphasis on facilities provided by the Agency to Member States (letters with the above-mentioned checklists have been sent to Member States), and
<P>
<DD>(f) established an international reporting system for unusual radiation-related events - and is inviting Member States to participate in it by providing reports on such events when these occur (the system includes a procedure for disseminating the lessons learned).
</DL>
<P>
<LI>A decision regarding what further efforts and resources should be devoted to the IRIS service will be taken in the light of the reports and other information received by the Secretariat through the activities outlined above.
</OL>
<P>             
<HR>         
<P>         
(1) A "panoramic" irradiator is a controlled-human-access irradiator in which the sealed source, when not in use, is fully shielded and, during use, is exposed within a radiation volume maintained inaccessible by an entry control system.
<P>
(2) It is believed that the inventory is far from complete as regards such irradiators in China and the former Soviet Union.

<H3>The Engineering Safety Review Service (ESRS)</H3>
<I>(Excerpt from a General Conference document.)</I>
<P>
<HR>                          
<P> 
<B>Background</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Through the ESRS, initiated in 1989, Member States can obtain the advice of interdisciplinary teams of independent experts on widely varying engineering safety aspects of planned or existing nuclear power plants (NPPs) - for example, siting, external hazards (such as earthquakes, hurricanes and forest fires), accident management and the impact of ageing. In practice, however, requests for reviews have tended to focus on questions connected with siting and with external hazards.(1)
<P>        
<LI>Site safety and external hazard reviews may cover a broad range of disciplines - for example, geology, seismology, hydrology, vulcanology, meteorology and tectonics - and the teams also look into matters like the local population distribution and the impact of possible man-induced events (e.g. an aircraft crash).
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Focus of reviews</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>When the focus is on seismic hazards capable of affecting the plant (which are assessed through "seismic safety review missions"), the review team includes experts in structural mechanics with experience of seismic capacity evaluation and of designing NPP structures, systems and components to resist seismic effects.
<P>
<LI> As only a few sites are at present being investigated with a view to the construction of new NPPs, the requests made by Member States in recent years have been mainly for reassessments of the safety of existing NPPs. In particular, the Secretariat has been receiving requests for seismic safety review missions to the sites of WWER-type NPPs.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Review findings</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>A conclusion which has emerged from such missions is that WWER-440/230 and 440/213 plants (and also RBMK plants) do not have inherent structural resistance to the types of load associated with earthquakes (and with similar external events). This is due to the fact that in such a plant only the pressure boundary (i.e. the structures and components under pressure) is designed to withstand extreme loads; the superstructures housing the reactor, turbines and emergency diesel generators are designed as normal industrial buildings with large spans and very little cross-bracing to take lateral (i.e. earthquake-induced) loads and are constructed in such a way that they have relatively low ductility. When the seismic        acceleration to be allowed for is low (e.g. ~ 0.1 g), minor structural strengthening may be sufficient; when it is even only slightly higher (0.2-0.3 g), however, complex and expensive structural upgrading becomes necessary.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>The seismic upgrading of NPPs(2)</B>
<P>
</CENTER>
<LI>Following seismic safety review missions, the seismic upgrading of structures, systems and components at the Kozloduy NPP (Bulgaria), the Bohunice and Mochovce NPPs (Slovakia) and the Paks NPP (Hungary) is under way. In Armenia, the seismic hazards associated with the site of the Medzamor NPP - shut down after the 1988 Spitak earthquake - have been reassessed, and the Armenian Government plans to put Unit 2 at Medzamor back into service after completion of the necessary seismic upgrading.
<P>
<LI>In Pakistan, seismic upgrading is in progress at the Karachi NPP, which went into service in 1972, and a seismic design review is being conducted of the 300-MW(e) NPP under construction at Chashma, use being made of the experience gained in seismic reassessments of various existing NPPs. Seismic PSA studies carried out for the Krsko NPP, Slovenia, are being reviewed.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Hazards associated with volcanoes</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>A number of reviews have been performed of hazards associated with volcanoes. One related to site investigations for an NPP to be built on the Muria Peninsula in Indonesia and another to the seismic reassessment carried out of the Medzamor NPP site in Armenia (see para. 6 above).
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Related activities</B>
</CENTER><P>
<LI>A database is being established for information on NPP sites and the possible external events associated with them. A data collection questionnaire has been prepared in this connection.
<P>
<LI>Twenty-two institutions in 14 countries are participating in a benchmark study connected with the seismic analysis and testing of WWER-type NPPs for which one of the units at the Paks NPP is serving as the prototype for WWER-440/213 plants and two units at the Kozloduy NPP are serving as the prototypes for WWER-1000 plants.

(1) A <A HREF=gc39infc3.html>list of the missions</A> completed and still to be carried out is given at the end of the Annex.
<P>
(2) At a conference on structural mechanics in reactor technology held in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1993, there were a considerable number of presentations on the seismic upgrading of NPPs, and at a subsequent seminar hosted by the Agency in Vienna the seismic upgrading of NPPs in Eastern Europe was a major topic .

<H3>The Assessment of Safety Culture in Organizations Team (ASCOT) Service</H3>
<I>(Excerpt from a General Conference document.)</I>
<P>
<HR>        
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>         
<LI>The ASCOT service became available at the beginning of 1993, after the publication by the Agency - in 1991 - of a report of the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG) entitled "Safety Culture" (published as Safety Series document No. 75-INSAG-4).  This report contains what is probably the most complete description so far of the "safety culture" concept. Soon after the report had been published, interest was expressed in the possibility of assessing safety culture in particular organizations despite the difficulties involved in assessing the human environment and human attitudes and performance.
<P>
<CENTER>            
<B>The ASCOT Guidelines</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The main purpose of the ASCOT service is to promote and support safety culture self-assessment and improvement by organizations in Member States, and the ASCOT Guidelines issued in IAEA-TECDOC-743 were developed for that purpose.
<P>
<LI>The ASCOT Guidelines are based on the Appendix ("Safety Culture Indicators") to the INSAG report mentioned above. Using the Guidelines, it should be possible to assess safety culture in the light of the description given in the INSAG report.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>ASCOT service options</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The following three options are offered to Member States:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a) expert support and advice prior to self-assessments, and expert support and advice following self-assessments;
<P>
<DD>(b) ASCOT reviews - which may be combined with, for example, ASSET reviews or Safety Review missions;
<P>
<DD>(c) standard ASCOT seminars - covering the "safety culture" concept and methods of assessing safety culture, and expanded ASCOT seminars - covering a wide range of operational safety topics and highlighting best world practices.
</DL>
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Experience to date (1)</B>
</CENTER>
<P>         
<LI>Since the inception of the ASCOT service, there have been three reviews (all carried out in conjunction with other types of review)- at the Sizewell B NPP in the United Kingdom, the Borssele NPP in the Netherlands and the Koeberg NPP in South Africa.  Considerable experience has also been acquired through 22 ASCOT seminars conducted in 18 countries (1). The experience acquired has highlighted the importance of promoting and enhancing safety culture in view of the fact that the root causes of many problems are related to intangible factors with tangible manifestations.
<P>
<LI>It has been noted that some organizations - for example, in France, South Africa, Spain and the United Kingdom - are already systematically assessing, promoting and enhancing safety culture. There appears to be a fairly high level of safety culture in most organizations, but room for improvement in all.
<P>
<LI>Among the shortcomings noted have been: inadequacy of policy statements (especially failure to emphasize the overriding importance of nuclear safety) at the corporate and the plant level; failure to communicate policy statements to all staff; non-inclusion of safety culture topics in training programmes; inability to clearly recognize good safety performance; infrequency of work checks by supervisors; poor communication between management and workers on safety issues; lack of a questioning attitude among staff; failure to encourage and reward problem identification; and acceptance of superficial root cause investigations .
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Outlook</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>As part of the effort to promote and support safety culture self-assessment by organizations in Member States, the Secretariat intends to publish reports highlighting best world practices in the area of safety culture enhancement.

<B>Background</B>
<P>
<LI>The INES Information System was established in March 1990 for the purpose of facilitating rapid communication between the nuclear community, the media and the public regarding the significance of nuclear events. Such events are classified for INES purposes as "out of scale", "below scale" or "on scale". Events "out of scale" do not have any nuclear safety relevance, while events "below scale" (called "deviations") are safety-relevant but not safety-significant. Events "on scale" - i.e. of safety significance - are categorized on the basis of their consequences (defence-in-depth degradation; on-site impact; and off-site impact) at seven levels; those categorized at level 1 are termed "anomalies", those categorized at levels 2 and 3 are termed "incidents" and those categorized at levels 4 to 7 are termed "accidents". (1)
<P>         
<LI>There were 55 countries participating in the INES Information System at the end of July 1995. At each nuclear facility in those countries, members of the staff are assigned the task of assessing the severity (in INES level terms) of operational events and communicating their conclusions to the INES Information System within 24 hours when the events are rated at INES level 2 or above or are important from the point of view of the public interest even if they are rated at INES level 1 or below. An updated list of participants in the INES Information System is given at the <A HREF=gc39infd4.html>end of this Annex</A>.
<P>
<LI>Information on the significance of events is conveyed on a standardized Event Rating Form through predetermined channels involving the INES National Officers of the participating countries and the Agency's INES Co-ordinator.
<P>
<B>Events in 1994 and the first half of 1995</B>
<P>
<LI>The INES Information System has received and disseminated Event Rating Forms relating to 61 events which occurred during 1994 at nuclear power plants (54) and other nuclear facilities (7). Of the 36 events "on scale", ten were rated at INES level 2 and 26 at level 1. Of the other 25 events, 24 were stated to be "below scale" (level 0) and one to be "out of scale". The 60 events rated at the levels 0, 1 and 2 were so rated on the grounds of "defence-in-depth degradation"; no event was so rated on the grounds of "on-site impact" or "off-site impact".
<P>
<LI>During the first six months of this year, 26 events at nuclear power plants and other nuclear facilities were reported to the INES Information System. Of the 11 events which were "on scale", two were rated at level 2 and nine at level 1.
<P>
<B>Feedback from the users of INES</B>
<P>
<LI>At a meeting of Senior Regulators held during the General Conference's 1994 session, a two-hour discussion on the use of INES by regulatory bodies highlighted the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>INES has gained wide public acceptance, and the media appear to have had no major difficulty in using INES when reporting on nuclear events.
<P>
<LI>The INES Information System is greatly appreciated by the participating countries as a means of promptly disseminating authoritative information on the significance of nuclear events.
<P>
<LI>There are, however, important differences among those who are reporting events as regards their assessments of the safety significance of defence-in- depth degradation, their perceptions of what is significant from the point of view of the public interest, and the promptness with which they report.
<P>
<LI>The regulatory body in one Member State believes that the INES procedures for assessing the severity of defence-in-depth degradation are too complicated and that simplified procedures would obviate lengthy technical discussions between regulatory and operating organizations, reduce the number of events rated at level 0 (a substantial fraction of the total number of events in some countries) and speed up the communication process at the international level.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>The report on the 1994 meeting of INES National Officers highlighted the following views of most participants:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The application of INES is proceeding satisfactorily in their countries.
<P>
<LI>The Agency should continue to help INES National Officers to provide training in the assessment of the safety significance of nuclear events. (2)
<P>
<LI>The responsibility for rating an event lies with the country where the event occurred (one should not attempt to rate events occurring in another country).
<P>
<LI>Redundant communication channels should be made available for the prompt transmission (by- for example- fax, electronic mail and telephone) of information on the significance of nuclear events.
<P>
<LI>Participating countries should report all events to the INES Information System, not just those involving an initiator (on the grounds that the unavailability of safety provisions is just as important as the occurrence of initiators which challenge the safety provisions).
<P>
<LI>INES National Officers should ensure round-the-clock coverage of their area of responsibility.
</UL>
<P>
<B>The INES Advisory Committee</B>
<P>
<LI>The INES Advisory Committee has met three times since the 1994 session of the General Conference.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>In October 1994, it reviewed the ratings on the Event Rating Forms sent to the INES Information System and clarified issues raised by INES National Officers.
<P>
<LI>In March 1995, it reviewed a questionnaire on "national communication policies and the use of INES" and approved it for circulation to INES National Officers.
<P>
<LI>In July 1995, having considered- in March- a proposal of the French regulatory body for a four-level event scale, it considered ways of simplifying the INES procedures for rating the severity of defence-in-depth degradation at nuclear power plants and at other nuclear facilities (this matter will be taken up again at the meeting of INES National Officers scheduled for October 1995).

<body>
<P>          Resolution 1060 (1996), Adopted Unanimously under
Chapter VII,          Demands Unconditional, Unrestricted Access
to Any and All Designated Sites <P><P>              Acting under
Chapter VII of the Charter, the Security Council this          
afternoon demanded that Iraq allow inspection teams of the United
Nations           Special Commission to have immediate,
unconditional and unrestricted access to           any and all
areas, facilities, equipment, records and means of transportation

         which they wished to inspect.                Through its
unanimous adoption of resolution 1060 (1996), as orally          
revised, the Council also deplored Iraq's failure to comply with
its           obligations under its resolutions 707 (1991) and
715 (1991), as a clear           violation of resolution 687
(1991).  It demanded that Iraq cooperate fully           with the
Special Commission in accordance with the relevant resolutions.  

            Specifically, the Council noted with concern
incidents over the past two           days in which Iraqi
authorities denied an inspection team access to designated       

  sites, and expressed full support for the Special Commission's
efforts to           implement its mandate.              
Resolution 687 (1991) established the cease-fire in the Gulf
conflict           and provided the conditions essential for the
restoration of peace and           security in the region.  It
requires Iraq to permit immediate on-site           inspection of
its biological, chemical and missile capabilities, based on      

   Iraq's declarations and the designation of any additional
locations by the           Special Commission itself.            

   By resolution 707 (1991), the Council demanded that Iraq allow
the           Special Commission, the International Atomic Energy
Agency and their           inspection teams immediate,
unconditional and unrestricted access to any and           all
areas, facilities, equipment, records and means of transport they
wish to           inspect.  Resolution 715 (1991) approved the
Commission's plan for ongoing           monitoring and
verification, and demanded Iraq's unconditional compliance with  

       it.               Statements were made by the
representatives of the Russian Federation,           Italy,
China, United Kingdom, Germany, Republic of Korea, Chile, United 

        States, France, Botswana and Egypt.               The
meeting, which was called to order at 5:10 p.m., was adjourned at

         5:52 p.m. <P><HR><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P>             
Draft Resolution <P>              The Security Council met this
afternoon to consider the situation           between Iraq and
Kuwait.  It had before it a draft resolution sponsored by the    

     United Kingdom and the United States (document S/1996/426),
which reads as           follows: <P>              "The Security
Council, <P>              "Recalling all its previous relevant
resolutions, and in particular              its resolutions 687

715 (1991) of 11 October 1991, <P>              "Recalling also

Nations Special Commission to the President of the Security
Council of 9 March           1996 (S/1996/182), the letter from
the President of the Security Council to           the Executive
Chairman of the Special Commission of 12 March 1996

 21 July 1993 (S/26127) and 1 December 1993 (S/26825), <P>       

     "Noting the progress made in the work of the Special
Commission towards           the elimination of Iraq's programmes

problems, reported by the Chairman of the Special Commission, <P>

            "Noting with concern the incidents on 11 and 12 June
1996, reported to           members of the Council by the
Executive Chairman of the Special Commission,           when
access by a Special Commission inspection team to sites in Iraq

they wish to inspect; <P>              "3.  Expresses its full
support to the Special Commission in its           efforts to
ensure implementation of its mandate under the relevant

Decides to remain seized of the matter." <P>             
Statements <P>              SERGEY V. LAVROV (Russian Federation)
said his Government reaffirmed its           dedication to the
implementation of Security Council resolution 687 (1991).        

 The recent incident in which Iraqi officials had denied access
by a Special           Commission inspection team to sites in
Iraq should not be repeated.  The draft           resolution
contained clear demands to that effect.  <P>              He
noted that the Council had avoided the language of threat.  Such 

        language could only have complicated the issue.  The
draft before the Council           reflected important
ammendments proposed by a number of delegations,including        

 the Russian Federation.  His country would vote in favour of the
draft           resolution. <P>              PAOLO CASARDI
(Italy) expressed his country's deep concern over the          
events of the past two days in Iraq, whose denial of access by
the Special           Commission's inspection teams was a clear
violation of Council resolutions.           This was the first
time Iraq had denied access to the designated inspection         

sites, and the Council must respond promptly.  Today's resolution
would send a           strong message to Iraq to cooperate in the
implementation of the Council's           resolutions.  Its
language was balanced and respected Iraq's sovereignty. <P>      

      WANG XUEXIAN (China) said his country had always supported
the work of           the Special Commission and was concerned
about Iraq's denial of access to           inspection sites by
the Commission's team.  Iraq must implement fully the          
Council's relevant resolutions.  The language of today's
resolution was           reasonable.  Resolution 687 (1991) must
be implemented in a comprehensive           manner, while
respecting Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.         

Amendments proposed by China had been included in the text; his
country would,           therefore, vote in favour of the draft.
<P><P><P><P><P><P><HR><P><P><P><P><P><P>         Security Council

                 -   4 -      Press Release SC/6231         
3672nd Meeting (PM)                          12 June 1996
<P><P><P>              Sir JOHN WESTON (United Kingdom) said the
Executive Chairman of the           Special Commission had
reported that "there are still significant deficiencies          
and gaps in Iraq's disclosures", that "the Commission had noted
recent           acquisitions of prohibited items by Iraq", and
that "a full accounting and           disposal of Iraq's holdings
of prohibited items has not been made".  Against           that
background, the Council had passed a resolution in response to
Iraqi           defiance of the will of the international
community as expressed in its           earlier resolutions.  It
was right that the Council had reacted quickly and          
robustly in the wake of Iraq's obstruction yesterday and today of
the Special           Commission's inspection team. <P>          

  It was clearly unacceptable for Iraq to declare that any
facilities or           sites off-limits, he said.  Security in
the Gulf required that Iraq's weapons           of mass
destruction be eliminated.  That could only be assured if Iraq
was           completely open with the Special Commission. 
However, the Commission was           still not satisfied that
the information and explanations provided by Iraq           gave
a complete picture of the situation.  It was also apparent that
Iraq was           continuing to withhold information. <P>       

     The Special Commission, therefore, had no alternative but to
continue           with intrusive, no-notice inspections, which
were fully within its mandate, he           said.  Inspections
were not designed to persecute Iraq or to infringe on its        

 sovereignty.  It was in Iraq's own interest to cooperate, as
that was the only           way progress could be made towards
fulfilling the requirements of resolution           687 (1991).
<P>              TONO EITEL (Germany) said the incidents of
yesterday and today were           particularly serious.  The
Iraqi leadership was trying to define the category           of
sites to be excluded from inspection, at a time when Iraq had
declared its           commitment to the aims of the Special
Commission.  However, that body could           only fulfil its
tasks if its inspection rights were fully respected by Iraq.     

    The current events demonstrated the risks faced by the
Special Commission's           staff. <P>              Today's
draft resolution was the appropriate answer to Iraq's action in  

       preventing the Commission from carrying out no-notice
inspections, he said.           Iraq should take the draft
resolution seriously and draw the right conclusions          
from it.  Any obstructions would only prolong the time needed by
the Special           Commission to complete its work.  He
appealed to the Government of Iraq to           remove any
obstacles to the work of the inspection teams. <P>             
PARK SOO GIL (Republic of Korea) said his country had a deep
interest in           and concern over the sanctions applied
against Iraq, which had serious           humanitarian
consequences.  For that reason, he had welcomed the recent       

  conclusion of a memorandum of understanding on the
implementation of Council           resolution 986 (1995). 
However, the incidents on 11 and 12 June were a source          
of disappointment and alarm.

Council                   -   5 -      Press Release SC/6231     

   3672nd Meeting (PM)                          12 June 1996
<P><P><P><P>              He said it had been hoped that the
pragmatism and realism of the talks           on resolution 986
(1995) would have been reflected in all aspects of Iraq's        

 external relations, including its interactions with the Special
Commission.           It had also been hoped that they would have
moved its relationship with the           international community
in a more desirable and mutually beneficial direction.          
The Republic of Korea would vote in favour of the draft
resolution. <P>              JUAN LARRAIN (Chile) said he was
concerned over the incidents of 11 and           12 June, when
the Special Commission's inspection team was denied access to    

     sites in Iraq, in violation of Security Council resolutions.

There was no           justification for Iraq's actions.  He
appealed to that Government not to stray           from the path
of cooperation it had followed in recent negotiations. <P>       

     The draft resolution, as orally revised, was adopted
unanimously as           Security Council resolution 1060 (1996).
<P>              MADELEINE K. ALBRIGHT (United States) said that
in March, when Iraq last           blocked inspection, her
delegation had urged the Council to act.  However, it          
had failed to respond adequately, so "here we go again".  Iraq
must not be           allowed to interfere with the Special
Commission's inspection teams.  The           Council's action
must be swift and strong, and the resolution just adopted met    

     that requirement.  Iraq must never again be allowed to
threaten the           international community.  Progress in
dismantling its weapons of mass           destruction must
continue.  The Commission must continue to follow the          
evidence, whether Iraq liked it or not.                 The
United States fully supported Rolf Ekeus, Executive Chairman of
the           Special Commission, and his team of inspectors, she
said.  Iraq should be           equally diligent in carrying out
its responsibilities.  The inspectors did not           threaten
security of the region; it was the Iraqi regime which still posed
a           serious threat.  If Iraq continued to block the
inspections, the Council would           have no alternative but
to conclude that Iraq was in material breach of          
resolutions 687 (1991), 707 (1991) and 715 (1991). <P>           

 ALAIN DEJAMMET (France) said the incident in which Iraq had
impeded the           Special Commission's inspection team from
carrying out its work justified           today's action.  He
would have preferred an immediate reaction through a          
presidential statement.  The text just adopted was in keeping
with provisions           already agreed upon.  He hoped the
Chairman of the Special Commission would be           able to
pursue his dialogue with the Iraqi authorities, so the Special   

      Commission might attain its objectives while respecting
Iraq's sovereignty.   <P>              The Council had been
gratified by the signing of the memorandum of          
understanding on the application of resolution 986 (1995) and the
positive           attitude demonstrated by Iraq in concluding
the negotiations.  That attitude           deserved
consideration.  It was in Iraq's interest to allow the Commission
to           complete its task; any delay in that work was felt,
first and foremost, by           Iraq.

<P><P><P><P>              MOTHUSI D.C. NKGOWE (Botswana) said his
Government regretted Iraq's           decision to deny the
Special Commission's inspection teams access to two          
Republican Guard facilities in Baghdad.  Iraq's action called
into question           its commitment to the full implementation
of Council resolutions.  While he           appreciated the
sovereign and national security concerns of the Iraqi          
Government, it was important that it comply with Council
resolutions.  Such           compliance did not violate Iraq's
sovereign rights.  An overly sensitive           position on
sovereignty was not in Iraq's long-term interest. <P>            

The recent Iraqi actions created a gap between its declared
intentions           and their translation into concrete action,
he said.  It was hoped that Iraq           would cooperate with
the Commission so that the relevant Council resolutions          
would be speedily implemented. <P>              The Council
President, NABIL EL-ARABI (Egypt), speaking as his country's     

    representative, said adoption of today's resolution
highlighted the need for           Iraq to implement fully all
relevant Council resolutions.  It also expressed           the
right of the Special Commission's inspection teams to inspect the
sites           and complete its tasks, as stated in the relevant
resolutions, particularly           resolution 687 (1991).  Egypt
supported the efforts of the Special Commission           and of
Mr. Ekeus, whose latest report stated that Iraq had made progress
in           dismantling and eliminating its weapons of mass
destruction.  Iraq's           compliance with the Council's
resolutions was the only way to ensure that the          
sanctions against it would be lifted and the suffering of its
people ended. <P>              He welcomed the implementation of
resolution 986 (1995), which permitted           the sale of some
Iraqi oil in exchange for badly needed food and medicine.        

 Progress must be made in implementing all relevant Council
resolutions so that           all the sanctions might be lifted. 
Such implementation would neither           undermine Iraq's
sovereignty nor jeopardize its national security.

Socialist Republics
Regarding the Treaty
for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
On 8 June 1978 the Director General received a note dated 6 June
from the Resident
Representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the
International Organizations
in Vienna in which he communicated the text of a statement made
by the Soviet Union on the
occasion of the signing of Additional Protocol II to the 
<A HREF="bginf179.html">Treaty</A> for the Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons in Latin America <I>[United Nations Treaty Series, Vol,
634, No, 9068]</I> in
Moscow on 18 May. In accordance with the request made
by the Resident Representative of the Soviet Union the texts of
his note and of the attached
statement are reproduced below. <I>[Unofficial translation by the
Agency's Secretariat.]</I>
<p>
<hr noshade size=1 width=40%>
<p>
I have the honour to inform you that the signing of Additional
Protocol II to the
Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America
(the Tlatelolco
Treaty) by the Soviet Union took place in Moscow on 18 May 1978.
This important
and constructive step was taken by the Soviet Union in conformity
with its basic policy
of working to reduce the threat of nuclear war.
<P>         
Additional Protocol II was signed on behalf of the Soviet Union
by
Mr. A.A. Gromyko, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. A statement,
the text of
which is attached, was made at the signing.
<P>         
I would request that you arrange for the distribution of the text
of this note
together with that of the above-mentioned statement as an
official Agency document.
<P>
<CENTER>
STATEMENT
</CENTER>
<P>         
made at the signing of Additional Protocol II to the Treaty for
the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (the Tlatelolco Treaty) by the
Soviet Union.
<P>
As a consistent advocate of the establishment of nuclear-free
zones in various
parts of the world and desiring to support the efforts of the
Latin American States
along these lines, the Soviet Government has decided to sign
Additional Protocol II
to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin
America (the Tlatelolco
Treaty).
<P>
In signing Additional Protocol II to the Tlatelolco Treaty, the
Government of the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics deems it necessary to state
the following:
<OL>
<LI>The Soviet Union proceeds from the assumption that the effect
of Article 1
of the Treaty extends, as specified in Article 5 of the Treaty,
to any nuclear explosive
device and that, accordingly, the carrying out by any party to
the Treaty of explosions
of nuclear devices for peaceful purposes would be a violation of
its obligations under
Article 1 and would be incompatible with its non-nuclear status,
For States parties
to the Treaty, a solution to the problem of peaceful nuclear
explosions can be found in
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons and within the framework of the international
procedures of the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
<P>
<LI>In signing Additional Protocol II, the Soviet Union proceeds
from the
assumption that at present the zone of application of the Treaty
comprises the
territories for which it is in force as provided in Article 4(1)
of the Treaty. The
signing of Additional Protocol II by the Soviet Union does not in
any way signify
recognition of the possibility of the force of the Treaty as
provided in Article 4(2)
being extended beyond the territories of the States parties to
the Treaty, including
air space and territorial waters as defined in accordance with
international law.
<P>
<LI>With regard to the reference in Article 3 of the Treaty to
"its own
legislation" in connection with the territorial waters, air space
and any other
space over which the States parties to the Treaty exercise
sovereignty, the
signing of Additional Protocol II by the Soviet Union does not
signify recognition
of their claims to the exercise of sovereignty which are contrary
to generally
accepted standards of international law.
<P>         
<LI>The Soviet Union takes note of the interpretation of the
Treaty given in the
Final Act of the Preparatory Commission for the Denuclearization
of Latin America
to the effect that the transport of nuclear weapons by the
parties to the Treaty is
covered by the prohibitions envisaged in Article 1 of the Treaty.
<P>         
<LI>The Final Act of the Preparatory Commission for the
Denuclearization of
Latin America includes an interpretation of the Treaty to the
effect that the granting
of permission for the transit of nuclear weapons at the request
of States not parties
to the Treaty lies within the competence of each individual State
party to the Treaty.
In this connection the Soviet Union reaffirms its position that
authorizing the transit
of nuclear weapons in any form would be contrary to the
objectives of the Treaty,
according to which, as specially mentioned in the Preamble, Latin
America must be
completely free from nuclear weapons, and that it would be
incompatible with the
non-nuclear status of the States parties to the Treaty and with
their obligations as
laid down in Article 1 thereof.
<P>
<LI>Any actions undertaken by a State party to, or States parties
to, the
Tlatelolco Treaty which are not compatible with their non-nuclear
status, and also
the commission by one or more States parties to the Treaty of an
act of aggression
with the support of a State which is in possession of nuclear
weapons or together with
such a State, will be regarded by the Soviet Union as
incompatible with the obligations
of those countries under the Treaty. In such cases the Soviet
Union reserves the right
to reconsider its obligations under Additional Protocol II.
<P>         
The Soviet Union further reserves the right to reconsider its
attitude to
Additional Protocol II in the event of any actions on the part of
other States possessing
nuclear weapons which are incompatible with their obligations
under the said Protocol.
<P>
<LI>The Soviet Government states that the provisions of the
articles of Additional
Protocol II are applicable to the text of the Treaty for the
Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons in Latin America in the wording of the Treaty at the time
of the signing of
the Protocol by the Government of the Soviet Union, due account
being taken of the
position of the Soviet Union as set out in the present statement.
In this connection,
any amendment to the Treaty entering into force in accordance
with the provisions
of Articles 29 and 6 of the Treaty without the clearly expressed
approval of the Soviet
Union shall have no force as far as the Soviet Union is
concerned.

<P>       
<I>Preamble</I>
<P>
In the name of their peoples and faithfully interpreting their
desires and aspirations, the Governments of the States which have
signed the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin
America,
<P>
<I>Desiring</I> to contribute, so far as lies in their power,
towards ending the armaments race, especially in the field of
nuclear weapons, and towards strengthening a world at peace,
based on the sovereign equality of States, mutual respect and
good neighbourliness, 
<P>
<I>Recalling</I> that the United Nations General
Assembly, in its resolution 808 (IX), adopted unanimously as one
of the three points of a co-ordinated programme of disarmament
"the total prohibition of the use and manufacture of nuclear
weapons and weapons of mass destruction of every type";
<P>
<I>Recalling</I> that militarily denuclearized zones are not an
end in themselves but rather a means for achieving general and
complete disarmament at a later stage,
<P>
<I>Recalling</I> United Nations General Assembly resolution 1911
(XVIII), which established that the measures that should be
agreed upon for the denuclearization of Latin America should be
taken "in the light of the principles of the Charter of the
United Nations and of regional agreements",
<P>
<I>Recalling</I> United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2028
(XX) which established the principle of an acceptable balance of
mutual responsibilities and duties for the nuclear and
non-nuclear powers, and
<P>
<I>Recalling</I> that the Charter of the Organization of American
States proclaims that it is an essential purpose of the
organization to strengthen the peace and security of the
hemisphere,
       

<P>
<I>Convinced:</I>
<P>
That the incalculable destructive power of nuclear weapons has
made it imperative that the legal prohibition of war should be
strictly observed in practice if the survival civilization and
the survival of mankind itself is to be assured,
<P>
That nuclear weapons, whose terrible effects are suffered,
indiscriminately and inexorably, by military forces and civilian
population alike, constitute, through the persistence of the
radioactivity they release, an attack on the integrity of the
human species and ultimately, may even render the whole
earth uninhabitable,
<P>
That general and complete disarmament under effective
international control is a vital matter which all the peoples of
the world equally demand,
<P>
That the proliferation of nuclear weapons, which seems
inevitable unless States, in the exercise of their sovereign
rights, impose restrictions on themselves in order to prevent it,
would make any agreement on disarmament  enormously difficult
and would increase the danger of the outbreak of a
nuclear conflagration, 
<P>
That the establishment of militarily
denuclearized zones is closely linked with the maintenance of
peace and security in the respective regions, 
<P>
That the military denuclearization of vast geographical zones,
adopted by the sovereign decision of the States comprised
therein, will exercise a beneficial influence on other regions
there similar conditions exist, 
<P>
That the privileged situation of the signatory States,
whose territories are wholly free from nuclear weapons, imposes
upon their the inescapable duty of preserving that situation both
in their own interests and for the good of mankind,
<P>
That the existence of nuclear weapons in any country of Latin
America would make it a target for possible nuclear attacks and
would inevitably set off, throughout the region a ruinous race in
nuclear weapons which would involve the unjustifiable diversion,
for warlike purposes, of the resources required for economic and
social development,
<P>
That the foregoing reasons, together with the traditional
peace-loving outlook of Latin America, give rise to an
inescapable necessity that nuclear energy should be used in that
region exclusively for peaceful purposes, and that the Latin
American countries should use their right to the greatest and
most equitable possible access to this new source of energy in
order to expedite the economic and social development of their
peoples,
<P>
<I>Convinced finally:</I>
<P>
That the military denuclearization of Latin America - being
understood to mean the undertaking entered into internationally
in this Treaty to keep their territories forever free from
nuclear weapons - will constitute a measure which will spare
their peoples from the squandering of their limited resources on
nuclear armaments and will protect them against possible nuclear
attacks on their territories, and will also constitute a
significant contribution towards preventing the proliferation of
nuclear weapons and a powerful factor for general and complete
disarmament, and
<P>
That Latin America, faithful to its tradition of universality,
must not only endeavour to banish from its homelands the scourge
of a nuclear war, but must also strive to promote the well-being
and advancement of its peoples, at the same time co-operating in
the fulfillment of the ideals of mankind,
that is to say, in the consolidation of a permanent peace based
on equal rights, economic fairness and social justice for all, in
accordance with the principles and purposes set forth in the
Charter of the United Nations and in the Charter of the
Organization of American States,

VIII SPECIAL SESSION OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE OF OPANAL
<P>         
STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR CARLOS PORTALES CIFUENTES,
DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR FOREIGN POLICY
ON THE OCCASION OF CHILE'S BECOMING A
CONTRACTING PARTY TO THE TLATELOLCO TREATY</B>
<BR>
(Mexico City, 18 January 1994)
</CENTER>
<P>         
It is my privilege to head the first Chilean delegation
participating in a meeting of this
General Conference after the action taken by my country to become
a full Contracting Party
to the Tlatelolco Treaty and to become a member of the Agency for
the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (OPANAL).
<P>         
This is an occasion of special importance and significance for
Chile. I therefore have
the great honor of transmitting to the distinguished delegates
participating in this meeting,
to the Secretariat of OPANAL and, in particular, to the
delegation of the Government of
Mexico, depositary of this international instrument, cordial and
fraternal greetings from his
Excellency, the President of the Republic of Chile, Mr. Patricio
Aylwin Az&oacute;car.
<P>         
I should like to recall that Chile has been closely associated
with the establishment
of the Tlatelolco system from the outset, as evidenced by the
joint statement by the Heads
of State of Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico and Chile, whose
Declaration on the
Denuclearization of Latin America of 29 April 1963 was supported
by the United Nations
General Assembly in resolution 1911 (XVIII). Having signed and
ratified the original
Treaty, we had an obligation to promote its aims and to refrain
from engaging in any acts
contrary to its objectives. Nevertheless, Chile still had to give
a further demonstration of
its political will in order to become a full member of the
system. This step was taken when
we solemnly deposited the declaration waiving the requirements
set forth in paragraph 1 of
Article 28 that have not yet been fulfilled and, in addition,
ratified all the amendments
approved to date by the meetings of signatories.
<P>         
The reform of 1992 represents a concrete example of what can be
achieved in the
region when there is common political will, a more imaginative
attitude and a clear desire
for a fresh approach and further progress. This joint initiative
is a response to the efforts
made during the last 25 years by the States party to the
Tlatelolco Treaty and by the
successive Secretaries General of OPANAL aimed at completing the
establishment of the first
inhabited nuclear-weapon-free zone in the world. In this
connection, I should like to
highlight the role played by Mexico as depositary State.
<P>         
The invitation extended by President Aylwin to the Heads of State
of Argentina and
Brazil to move jointly towards full implementation of the
Tlatelolco Treaty and its "zone of
application" undoubtedly marked the beginning of one of the most
important diplomatic
initiatives in which Chile has been involved during the last few
years. It is a reflection of
Chile's desire to participate actively in the design and
improvement of the schemes and
instruments that contribute to international security, through
both regional and international
actions.
<P>         
With these specific steps, the Chilean Government has sought to
emphasize its total
renunciation and repudiation of the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction and to
demonstrate its commitment to making a major contribution to the
advancement of this cause.
In the light of the new challenges posed by international
developments, we have begun to
take steps towards seriously evaluating our commitments with
regard to security and giving
thorough consideration to promoting the cause of disarmament.
<P>         
We are endeavouring to adopt a fresh approach in our efforts to
make an effective and
imaginative contribution to the establishment of a genuine system
of security and we are
ready to undertake new commitments in this area. These include
other initiatives designed
to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in
particular the Mendoza
Declaration, the signing of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the
improvement of the 1972
Biological Weapons Convention and the withdrawal of the
reservation maintained by Chile
since 1935 with respect to the Geneva Protocol for the
Prohibition of the Use in War of
Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological
Methods of Warfare.
<P>         
We should therefore like to see the gradual, natural
incorporation of Chile in the main
forums related to this subject. That is why we have promoted the
holding of a regional
conference on confidence and security measures and have offered
to host the next regular
session of OPANAL's General Conference.
<P>         
We hope that our region will become a place of peace and mutual
confidence, where
uncertainties will disappear and a spirit of understanding will
prevail. The indisputable fact
that Latin America is at present one of the most peaceful regions
of the world gives us new
hope that the contribution which we are making to the cause of
peace and security is both
necessary and relevant. It compels us to continue to move forward
by undertaking new
commitments and by improving the existing instruments.
<P>         
The latest international developments present major challenges
for world security.
On the one hand, there have been significant advances brought
about by the conclusion of
the START I and II Treaties, the adoption of the Chemical Weapons
Convention, the
announcements of unilateral moratoriums on nuclear tests, the
improvements in the systems
for the control of military and dual-use technology, the
development of the inspection
capabilities of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the
establishment of the United
Nations Register of Conventional Arms. These all constitute
achievements of historic
significance in terms of their extensive cover. On the other
hand, new systems of security
are also being established, with varying degrees of
effectiveness, offering ways of finding
negotiated solutions to regional conflicts.
<P>
In other areas, much still remains to be done: there are still
threats of proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction and, in a framework of growing
interdependence, science and
technology, while opening up promising avenues towards progress,
paradoxically also
facilitate access to new methods of annihilation. Chile is
convinced that today, more than
ever before, there is a need to adopt a comprehensive and
integrated approach to the problem
of weapons of mass destruction through balanced and
non-discriminatory multilateral
agreements. The comprehensive nature of such agreements should
facilitate the integration
of all the actors on the international scene in genuinely
universal agreements which would
serve as deterrents and would not impede access to the full
development of advanced dual-use
technologies for exclusively peaceful purposes. These principles
should provide guidance
for the improvement of other disarmament agreements in the area
of weapons of mass
destruction at regional and global level. It should be noted that
the Convention on the
Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use
of Chemical Weapons and
on Their Destruction establishes standards similar to those laid
down in the Tlatelolco Treaty,
with additional provisions suited to the specialized nature of
the subject involved. Chile
attaches particular importance to the concept of challenge
inspections, which are now
enshrined for the first time in an international treaty and whose
progressive development we
have also promoted in the International Atomic Energy Agency.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>        
Mr. President,
</DL>
<P>         
The reforms to the Tlatelolco control regime have created a
graded, integrated and
balanced structure, which begins with reports by the Parties and
proceeds with the
requirement for special reports. If no satisfactory response is
provided, these reports are
followed by a request for a special inspection, for whose
implementation the International
Atomic Energy Agency is responsible and which has to be carried
out in accordance with
Article 12 of the Tlatelolco Treaty. By means of these
inspections, the IAEA has to verify
the whole scope of compliance with the commitments undertaken by
the Contracting Parties.
In our view this means that, in accordance with Article 19,
OPANAL and the IAEA should
conclude a new agreement, authorized by the General Conference,
to "facilitate the efficient
operation of the control system".
<P>
The way in which the Tlatelolco Treaty and its Additional
Protocols have evolved
indicates the course we should adopt in order to generate and
strengthen a climate of greater
confidence and security between our countries. Although the
Treaty was conceived at a very
different time to the present one, we can see today that it has
lost nothing of its validity and
relevance. Its progressive nature has made it possible to extend
its scope without weakening
the commitments already undertaken. Its flexibility has made it
easier for major powers to
join the regime for the prohibition of nuclear weapons enshrined
in it. The spirit and letter
of the Treaty present to the rest of the world a vital wealth of
principles and standards,
prominent among which are the extensive and comprehensive nature
of the Treaty's
provisions and the concept of a mechanism for the effective
international control of nuclear
disarmament, which was both original and ahead of its time.
<P>
The notion of "nuclear-weapon-free zone" promoted by the
Tlatelolco Treaty is based
on the premise that the commitments undertaken have identical
significance with regard to
all the parties involved and, in this respect, goes far beyond
the concept of non-proliferation.
The objective of a definitive and complete prohibition of all
types of nuclear weapon is one
that should be shared by the whole of humanity. To achieve this
objective, we must first
strengthen the Tlatelolco Treaty's zone of application to cover
the whole area; contribute to
the establishment with adjacent regions covered by the Antarctic
Treaty and the Rarotonga
Treaty of an extensive system of peace; and watch sympathetically
the process of the
creation of similar zones in regions where, as in the case of
Africa, negotiations for the
establishment of denuclearized zones have already begun.
<P>         
In resolution ll(I), OPANAL's General Conference invited the
Director General of
the IAEA to prepare a safeguards project which could serve as the
basis for the negotiation
of the agreements provided for in Article 13 of the Treaty. In
accordance with the spirit and
practice of the Tlatelolco Treaty, such agreements should be
full-scope, prohibit any military
purpose and help to ensure that the parties comply with their
obligations. The Chilean
Government has already initiated the exchange of information
which should lead to the
negotiation of a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA
so as to ensure
compliance with Article 13 of the Tlatelolco Treaty within the
stipulated time-limits.
<P>         
It is common knowledge that the denuclearization established by
the Tlatelolco Treaty
is limited to military purposes. Therefore, any peaceful use of
nuclear energy, in other
words, any use for non-military purposes, is permitted and
constitutes an inalienable right
of each State. In the case of the Tlatelolco Treaty, this is
specifically recognized in
Article 17.
<P>         
Within this reference framework, we regard with great interest
the future role which
could be given to OPANAL as an appropriate organization to assume
responsibility for the
regional co-ordination of the exercise of its members' rights "in
conformity with this Treaty,
to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in particular for
their economic development and
social progress". As the former Secretary General, Mr. Antonio
Stempel Paris, had occasion
to point out, OPANAL could extend its range of activities to this
sphere and adopt a
substantially different course to that pursued hitherto.
<P>         
We should recall that already in 1977 the members of OPANAL
indicated their desire
for it to be involved in the planning, systematization,
organization and co-ordination at
regional level of Latin American efforts to ensure the full and
effective peaceful use of
nuclear energy. The member countries now have the political will
to achieve this objective.
In order to do so, OPANAL should be given the necessary resources
and clear, specific
functions establishing it as a regional organ responsible for the
co-ordination of the peaceful
uses of nuclear energy.
<P>         
At its session in May 1993, OPANAL's General Conference approved
a resolution
which included a set of measures directed towards this end. We
are looking forward to the
evaluation report which the OPANAL Council has been requested to
provide for the
XIV session period in 1995, and to the Secretary General's
proposals for promoting
co-operation in the training of scientists in the region,
including co-operation with institutions
and universities of developed countries.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>         
Mr President,
</DL>
<P>         
Chile began to take the first initiatives in the area of nuclear
research in the 1950s
It participated in the first international meeting on the
peaceful uses of nuclear energy, which
took place in Geneva, and participated in the adoption of the
Statute of the IAEA, of which
Chile became a member in 1960.
<P>         
Later, in 1964, the Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission was set up
as an autonomous
administrative organization responsible for all matters related
to the peaceful uses of nuclear
energy and nuclear-related materials in order to ensure
integrated development in this field.
<P>         
The Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission has two basic functions: to
promote the
development of the peaceful uses and applications of nuclear
energy, and to control those
applications in order to protect human life and health, goods and
the environment. In
carrying out these functions, the Commission has co-operated
closely and continuously with
the IAEA. Of particular importance in this context are the
projects implemented under the
Regional Co-operative Arrangements for the Promotion of Nuclear
Science and Technology
in Latin America (ARCAL).
<P>         
It is important to stress Chile's interest in the development of
nuclear technologies in
areas such as medicine, the study of structures and parts, the
measurement and analysis of
natural and industrial processes, food preservation, treatment of
waste and others too
numerous to list.
<P>         
We are sure that our role as a full member of OPANAL will not
only open up
possibilities for horizontal co-operation in the peaceful use of
nuclear energy, but will also
put us in a better position for fulfilling our commitments in the
area of peace,
non-proliferation, security and, hence, disarmament.
<P>         
With the lifting of the threat of nuclear proliferation in our
region, the time has come
to strengthen and promote the system which has made this notable
achievement possible.
Chile is taking up this challenge enthusiastically. We will
tackle the remaining tasks with
the same decisiveness and determination that characterized the
action which has led to our
presence here today.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>         
Thank you very much.

<P>
<OL>
<LI>The operator of a nuclear installation shall be liable for
nuclear damage upon proof that such damage has been caused by a
nuclear incident -
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a)  in his nuclear installation; or
<P>
<DD>(b)  involving nuclear material coming from or originating in
his nuclear installation, and occurring - 
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(i)  before liability with regard to nuclear incidents
involving the nuclear material has been assumed, pursuant to the

but
<P>
<DD>(iv) where the nuclear material has been sent to a person
within the territory of a non-Contracting State, before it has
been unloaded from the means of transport by which it has arrived
in the territory of that non-Contracting State;
</DL>
<P>
<DD>(c)  involving nuclear material sent to his nuclear
installation, and occurring -
<P>
<dL>
<DD>(i)  after liability with regard to nuclear incidents
involving the nuclear material has been assumed by him, pursuant
to the express terms of a contract in writing, from the operator
of another nuclear installation;
<P>
<DD>(ii) in the absence of such express terms, after he has taken
charge of the nuclear material; or
<P>
<DD>(iii)     after he has taken charge of the nuclear material
from a person operating a nuclear reactor with which a means of
transport is equipped for use as a source of power, whether for
propulsion thereof or for any other purpose; but
<P>
<DD>(iv) where the nuclear material has, with the written consent
of the operator, been sent from a person within the territory of
a non-Contracting State, only after it has been loaded on the
means of transport by which it is to be carried from the
territory of that State;
</DL>
</DL>
<P>
provided that, if nuclear damage is caused by a nuclear incident
occurring in a nuclear installation and involving nuclear
material stored therein incidentally to the carriage of such
material, the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph
shall not apply where another operator or person is solely liable
pursuant to the provisions of sub-paragraph (b) or (c) of
this paragraph.
<P>
<LI>The Installation State may provide by legislation that, in
accordance with such terms as may be specified therein, a carrier
of nuclear material or a person handling radioactive waste may,
at his request and with the consent of the operator concerned, be
designated or recognized as operator in the place of that
operator in respect of such nuclear material or radioactive waste
respectively.  In this case such carrier or such person shall be
considered, for all the purposes of this Convention, as an
operator of a nuclear installation situated within the territory
of that State.

<P>
<LI>   (a)  Where nuclear damage engages the liability of more
than one operator, the operators involved shall, in so far as the
damage attributable to each operator is not reasonably separable,
be jointly and severally liable.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(b)  Where a nuclear incident occurs in the course of
carriage of nuclear material, either in one and the same means of
transport, or, in the case of storage incidental to the carriage,
in one and the same nuclear installation, and causes nuclear
damage which engages the liability of more than one operator, the
total liability shall not exceed the highest amount applicable
with respect to any one of them pursuant to Article V.
<P>
<DD>(c)  In neither of the cases referred to in sub-paragraphs
(a) and (b) of this paragraph shall the liability of any one
operator exceed the amount applicable with respect to him
pursuant to Article V.

where several nuclear installations of one and the same operator
are involved in one nuclear incident, such operator shall be
liable in respect of each nuclear installation involved up to the
amount applicable with respect to him pursuant to Article V.
<P>
<LI>Except as otherwise provided in this Convention, no person
other than the operator shall be liable for nuclear damage. 
This, however, shall not affect the application of any
international convention in the field of transport in force or
open for signature, ratification or accession at the date on
which this Convention is opened for signature.
<P>
<LI>No person shall be liable for any loss or damage which is not
nuclear damage pursuant to sub-paragraph (k) of paragraph 1 of
Article I but which could have been included as such pursuant to
sub-paragraph (k) (ii) of that paragraph.
<P>
<LI>Direct action shall lie against the person furnishing
financial security pursuant to Article VII, if the law of the
competent court so provides.
</OL>
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>ARTICLE III</B>
</CENTER>
<P>

The operator liable in accordance with this Convention shall
provide the carrier with a certificate issued by or on behalf of
the insurer or other financial guarantor furnishing the financial
security required pursuant to Article VII.  The certificate shall
state the name and address of that operator and the amount, type
and duration of the security, and these statements may not be
disputed by the person by whom or on whose behalf the certificate
was issued.  The certificate shall also indicate the nuclear
material in respect of which the security applies and shall
include a statement by the competent public authority of the
Installation State that the person named is an operator within
the meaning of this Convention.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>ARTICLE IV</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The liability of the operator for nuclear damage under this
Convention shall be absolute.
<P>
<LI>If the operator proves that the nuclear damage resulted
wholly or partly either from the gross negligence of the person
suffering the damage or from an act or omission of such person
done with intent to cause damage, the competent court may, if its
law so provides, relieve the operator wholly or partly from his
obligation to pay compensation in respect of the damage suffered
by such person.
<P>
<LI>(a)  No liability under this Convention shall attach to an
operator for nuclear damage caused by a nuclear incident directly
due to an act of armed conflict, hostilities, civil war or
insurrection.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(b)  Except in so far as the law of the Installation State
may provide to the contrary, the operator shall not be liable for
nuclear damage caused by a nuclear incident directly due to a
grave natural disaster of an exceptional character.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>Whenever both nuclear damage and damage other than nuclear
damage have been caused by a nuclear incident or jointly by a
nuclear incident and one or more other occurrences, such other
damage shall, to the extent that it is not reasonably separable
from the nuclear damage, be deemed, for the purposes of this
Convention, to be nuclear damage caused by that nuclear incident.

Where,  however, damage is caused jointly by a nuclear incident
covered by this Convention and by an emission of ionizing
radiation not covered by it, nothing in this Convention shall
limit or otherwise affect the liability, either as regards
any person suffering nuclear damage or by way of recourse or
contribution, of any person who may be held liable in connection
with that emission of ionizing radiation.
<P>
<LI>The operator shall not be liable under this Convention for
nuclear damage - 
<P>
<DL>

<DD>(a)  to the nuclear installation itself or to any property on
the site of that installation which is used or to be used in
connection with that installation; or
<P>
<DD>(b)  to the means of transport upon which the nuclear
material involved was at the time of the nuclear incident.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>Any Installation State may provide by legislation that
sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 5 of this Article shall not apply,
provided that in no case shall the liability of the operator
in respect of nuclear damage, other than nuclear damage to the
means of transport, be reduced to less than US $5 million for any
one nuclear incident.
<P>
<LI>Nothing in this Convention shall affect -
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a)  the liability of any individual for nuclear damage for
which the operator, by virtue of paragraph 3 or 5 of this
Article, is not liable under this Convention and which that
individual caused by an act or omission done with intent to cause
damage; or
<P>
<DD>(b)  the liability outside this Convention of the operator
for nuclear damage for which, by virtue of sub-paragraph (b) of
paragraph 5 of this Article, he is not liable under this
Convention.

<LI>The liability of the operator may be limited by the
Installation State to not less than US $5 million for any one
nuclear incident.
<P>
<LI>Any limits of liability which may be established pursuant to
this Article shall not include any interest or costs awarded by a
court in actions for compensation of nuclear damage.
<P>
<LI>The United States dollar referred to in this Convention is a
unit of account equivalent to the value of the United States
dollar in terms of gold on 29 April 1963, that is to say US
$35 per one troy ounce of fine gold.

<OL>
<LI>Rights of compensation under this Convention shall be
extinguished if an action is not brought within ten years from
the date of the nuclear incident.  If, however, under the law
of the Installation State the liability of the operator is
covered by insurance or other financial security or by State
funds for a period longer than ten years, the law of the
competent court may provide that rights of compensation against
the operator shall only be extinguished after a period which may
be longer than ten years, but shall not be longer than the period
for which his liability is so covered under the law of the
Installation State.  Such extension of the extinction period
shall in no case affect rights of compensation under this
Convention of any person who has brought an action for loss of
life or personal injury against the operator before the expiry of
the aforesaid period of ten years.
<P>
<LI>Where nuclear damage is caused by a nuclear incident
involving nuclear material which at the time of the nuclear
incident was stolen, lost, jettisoned or abandoned, the period
established pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article shall be
computed from the date of that nuclear incident, but the period
shall in no case exceed a period of twenty years from the
date of the theft, loss, jettison or abandonment.
<P>
<LI>The law of the competent court may establish a period of
extinction or prescription of not less than three years from the
date on which the person suffering nuclear damage had
knowledge or should have had knowledge of the damage and of the
operator liable for the damage, provided that the period 
established pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article
shall not be exceeded.
<P>
<LI>Unless the law of the competent court otherwise provides, any
person who claims to have suffered nuclear damage and who has
brought an action for compensation within the period applicable
pursuant to this Article may amend his claim to take into account
any aggravation of the damage, even after the expiry of that
period, provided that final judgment has not been entered.
<P>
<LI>Where jurisdiction is to be determined pursuant to
sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 3 of Article XI and a request has
been made within the period applicable pursuant to this
Article to any one of the Contracting Parties empowered so to
determine, but the time remaining after such determination is
less than six months, the period within which an action
may be brought shall be six months, reckoned from the date of
such determination.

<P>
<OL>
<LI>The operator shall be required to maintain insurance or other
financial security covering his liability for nuclear damage in
such amount, of such type and in such terms as
the Installation State shall specify.  The Installation State
shall ensure the payment of claims for compensation for nuclear
damage which have been established against the operator by
providing the necessary funds to the extent that the yield of
insurance or other financial security is inadequate to satisfy
such claims, but not in excess of the limit, if any, established
pursuant to Article V.
<P>
<LI>Nothing in paragraph 1 of this Article shall require a
Contracting Party or any of its constituent sub-divisions, such
as States or Republics, to maintain insurance or other financial
security to cover their liability as operators.
<P>
<LI>The funds provided by insurance, by other financial security
or by the Installation State pursuant to paragraph 1 of this
Article shall be exclusively available for compensation
due under this Convention.
<P>
<LI>No insurer or other financial guarantor shall suspend or
cancel the insurance or other financial security provided
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article without giving notice in
writing of at least two months to the competent public authority
or, in so far as such insurance or other financial security
relates to the carriage of nuclear material, during the
period of the carriage in question.

by virtue of such systems against the operator liable shall be
determined, subject to the provisions of this Convention, by the
law of the Contracting Party in which such systems have been
established, or by the regulations of the intergovernmental
organization which has established such systems.

<LI>   (a)  If a person who is a national of a Contracting Party,
other than the operator, has paid compensation for nuclear damage
under an international convention or under the law of a
non-Contracting State, such person shall, up to the amount which
he has paid, acquire by subrogation the rights under this   
Convention of the person so compensated.  No rights shall be so
acquired by any person to the extent that the operator has a
right of recourse against such person under this Convention.

<P>
On behalf of the countries that originally proposed the
amendments to the Tlatelolco
Treaty which this Conference has just approved, I wish to express
our deep gratitude to
the sister nations of Latin America and the Caribbean for the
expeditious manner and the
atmosphere of solidarity in which the meeting was held.
<P>
We also express our sincere thanks to the Government of Mexico
for the highly efficient
arrangements made by it to ensure that our meeting was conducted
with dispatch and
achieved the success which we were looking forward to.  Likewise
we express our
appreciation of the valuable co-operation extended by the OPANAL
Secretariat to the
work done here.
<P>
In this connection, on behalf of the Governments of Argentina,
Brazil and Chile, I have
pleasure in making the following declaration:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Governments of the Argentine Republic, the Federative
Republic of Brazil and the
Republic of Chile, considering that under Article 28, paragraph
(2), of the Treaty of
Tlatelolco for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin
America and the Caribbean all
Signatory States have the imprescriptible right to waive, wholly
or in part, the
requirements laid down in Article 28, paragraph (1), and that
they may do so by means of
a declaration, which is to be annexed to their respective
instruments of ratification and
which may be formulated at the time of deposit of the instrument
or subsequently, declare
that, as soon as the three countries have completed the
procedures for ratification of the
Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America
and the Caribbean, as
amended, they will waive all the requirements which have not yet
been met and which are
referred to in Article 28, paragraph (1) of the Treaty.

The attached text of a declaration made by the Presidents of
Argentina
and Brazil on 14 February 1992 at a special meeting of the Agency
for the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (OPANAL) held in
Mexico City
to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty
for the

<CENTER>
<B>DECLARATION BY THE PRESIDENTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA AND
THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL ON THE 25th ANNIVERSARY OF
THE SIGNING OF THE TREATY OF TLATELOLCO</B>
</CENTER>
<P>         
Since assuming the office of President in our two countries we
have given
a fresh and powerful impetus to the adoption of a common nuclear
policy, among
other things in questions relating to non-proliferation. We have
always been
prompted by the aim of endowing our nuclear programmes with both
internal and
external transparency and of demonstrating to the international
community the
exclusively peaceful objectives which guide them, in conformity
with the
spirit of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the 25th anniversary of which
we are
celebrating today.
<P>         
That programme reflects the determination and the political will
of our
Governments to strengthen regional and international peace and
security, among
other things through the adoption of clear verification
mechanisms.
<P>         
In that context we agreed, in the Declaration on Common Nuclear
Policy
signed on 28 November 1990 at Foz do Igua&ccedil;u, on three
concrete steps:
<DL>
<DD>- The establishment of a Common System of Accounting and
Control of
Nuclear Materials;
<P>
<DD>- The conclusion of a joint safeguards agreement with the
International Atomic Energy Agency; and
<P>
<DD>- The adoption of pertinent measures leading to the full
entry into
force for both countries of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, including
whatever steps are necessary to update and improve the text of
the
Treaty.
</DL>
<P>         
The international community has been witness to the speed and
efficiency
with which these goals were achieved. The results are familiar to
all:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- The Agreement between Argentina and Brazil for the
Exclusively
Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy, signed on 18 July 1991 in the
city
of Guadalajara, which has already been approved by the Congresses
of our two countries and ratified by the two Governments. This
Agreement reflects the practical achievement of the first step;
and
<P>
<DD>- The signature on 13 December 1991 of the Agreement between
Argentina, Brazil, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting
and Control of Nuclear Materials and the International Atomic
Energy Agency for the application of safeguards.
</DL>
<P>         
Today we are taking effective steps to fulfil the third and final
commitment mentioned in the Foz do Igua&ccedil;u Declaration. As
soon as possible
we shall be submitting for the consideration of OPANAL a number
of amendments to
the text of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, amendments which are highly
technical in
nature and which in no way affect the principles and objectives
of the Treaty.
<P>         
We ask all the countries of our region to grant us the support
necessary to make this initiative successful, since its aim is to
facilitate
application of the Treaty.
<P>         
We congratulate the Government of France on its decision to
ratify
Additional Protocol I to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, a step which
should, we
hope in the near future, establish definitively its legal force
for the whole
region for which it is intended.
<P>         
All these recent developments, which point to the profound desire
shared by all of us to consolidate Latin America and the
Caribbean as a zone
free of nuclear weapons, have led us to the common conviction
that completion
of the process just referred to of approving amendments to the
text of the
Treaty will definitively open the way to its entry into force in
our countries.
<P>         
In this way Argentina and Brazil are contributing clearly and
positively to the establishment of a new international climate
characterized
by co-operation and by the creation of confidence among nations
as central
elements in the preservation of peace and international security.

"The Government of the Republic of Cuba declares that the obstacles which have until
now prevented the Republic of Cuba from becoming a full party to the Treaty for the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean remain and continue
seriously to affect Cuban security. The only nuclear Power in this part of the world, the
United States of America, is maintaining a policy of hostility towards Cuba; it is intensifying
its economic, commercial and financial blockade, reinforcing its campaign against the country
and maintaining by force and against the will of our people the illegal occupation of part of
the national territory, through which even ships carrying nuclear weapons pass, a problem
whose solution will in the future have to be considered a condition for our country to stay
within this Treaty".

<B>Statement by Minister Robaina at the Tlatelolco Treaty
Signing Ceremony</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Your Excellency the Minister of External Relations of Mexico,
<P>
Members of the Mexican delegation attending,
<P>
Guests and compatriots,
<P>
Cuba, once again, is showing the world that it is true to its commitments. On this
occasion, in signing the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and
the Caribbean, also known as the Tlatelolco Treaty, the Government of Cuba is honouring
an undertaking made by President Fidel Castro Ruz on the occasion of the First American
Summit in Guadalajara.
<P>
This step should be viewed as further proof of our country s desire to integrate fully
into the Latin American and Caribbean community, and as confirmation of our confidence
in the future of that united Latin America which our long-suffering peoples demand today
more than ever.
<P>        
Despite great dangers and the need for major sacrifices, this act is also a reaffirmation
by the Cuban Government of the genuinely peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. But
we reiterate in all responsibility that the obstacles which have so far prevented our becoming
full parties in this Treaty remain and continue seriously to affect the security of our country.
<P>
The only nuclear Power in this part of the world, the United States of America, is
maintaining a policy of hostility towards Cuba which involves strengthening of the economic,
commercial and financial blockade, reinforcement of the campaign against my country and
the maintenance by force and against the will of our people of the illegal occupation of part
of the national territory, through which even ships carrying nuclear weapons pass, a problem
whose solution will in the future have to be considered a condition for our country to stay
within the Treaty.
<P>
We are not talking here about dangers for Cuba alone, for in fact the tensions
provoked by the aggressive escalation and the siege laid by the United States are potentially
explosive risks for the rest of the continent, which cannot feel secure when faced with the
impunity of a neighbouring power which ignores international law and the resolutions of the
United Nations in the pursuit of clearly hegemonistic and geopolitical goals which are more
unfounded than ever now that the bipolar confrontation and the Cold War have come to an
end in the rest of the world.
<P>
 It is not right that only the countries of Latin America should be asked formally to
renounce the possession of nuclear weapons and to accept independent checks on their        
compliance with this commitment, unless at the same time, under the provisions of the
Tlatelolco Treaty, verification is demanded of the obligations assumed by the nuclear Powers
in accordance with Protocols I and II of this instrument.
<P>
This would allow it to be established that this type of armament does not exist in any
part of the territory of Latin America and the Caribbean, and thus we would be able to
affirm with confidence that the region is genuinely free of nuclear weapons.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>         
Mr. Chancellor,
<P>         
For Cuba it has always been a principle to speak out against all weapons of mass
extermination. Similarly, we consider that no country should have a monopoly on such
weapons, in this case nuclear weapons, because such a monopoly establishes a privileged
status which runs counter to the principle of sovereign equality of States.
<P>
We are in favour of the total banning of nuclear weapons as the only way of
guaranteeing a lasting peace and the security of everyone without distinction. Those who
must in the first instance honour this principle are the so-called nuclear Powers. Therefore
Cuba continues to reject the privilege held by the States possessing nuclear weapons, which
in maintaining their status demand of the international community the renunciation of this
option, negative as it may be. Moreover, it is inconsistent for the Powers to undertake
modest reductions in their arsenals when what remains would be more than sufficient to
destroy our planet several times over.
<P>
It was for strictly moral reasons that Cuba, having no potential, resources or
technology to manufacture such weapons, did not sign the Tlatelolco Treaty earlier. To do
so we considered would constitute a unilateral renunciation in return for which we would
receive only hostility, pressure and threats of aggression from the United States. On the other
hand, we also bore in mind that not all countries in the region had signed the Treaty.
<P>
Nonetheless, in recent times the regional scenario has changed substantially for Cuba.
We are rejoining what we never ceased to belong, to the community of Latin America and
the Caribbean, with which we have developed and strengthened relations which, albeit
insufficient, are confirmation of the desire for integration which our country has always had
since the very birth of Cuban nationality and the ideas of our wars of independence.
<P>
From a country isolated by imperialist design, with the honourable exception of
 Mexico, Cuba is maintaining and intensifying its relations with practically the entire
continent, on which rejection of the United States blockade against Cuba is spreading wider
every day.
<P>
The integration of our peoples is not only possible today, it is also necessary as being
the only way to reaffirm and defend the economic and political independence of Latin
America
<P>
These latter considerations explain our decision today to sign the Tlatelolco Treaty
despite the continued existence, and in some cases even accentuation, of the reasons for
which Cuba until now abstained from taking such an important step.
<P>
Once again, this decision is an addition to our modest contribution to the unity, solidarity
and integration of peoples from the Rio Bravo to Patagonia, of this greater Fatherland which,
in his vision of the future, Jose Martl defined as Our America.
<P>
Many thanks.

18th CONSULTATIVE MEETING OF CONTRACTING PARTIES TO THE CONVENTION ON THE PREVENTION OF MARINE POLLUTION BY DUMPING OF WASTES AND OTHER MATTER, 1972: 4-8 DECEMBER 1995</I></B>
</SMALL>
<P>
<H3>Draft protocol to London Convention ready for conference</H3>
<SMALL><I>From the IMO News, published by the International Maritime Organization</I></SMALL>
</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A Special Meeting of Contracting Parties to the Convention on the Prevention of Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972 (the London Convention or LC), will be held at IMO headquarters from 28 October to 8 November to consider and adopt a protocol to the Convention.
<P>
The draft protocol was finalized at the 18th Consultative Meeting of Contracting Parties in December 1995. It is expected that the protocol will be the biggest change to the Convention since its adoption in 1972 and will represent a major change of direction that reflects the changes in attitudes towards marine waste disposal that have taken place in recent years.
<P>
The decision to include the changes in a protocol rather than simple amendments was made because the proposed changes are so extensive that they will, if adopted, amount to a virtual re-writing of the Convention. The protocol will supersede the original 1972 Convention.
<P>
The 18<SUP>th</SUP> Consultative Meeting agreed in principle that Parties, according to their scientific, technical and economic capabilities, should not only aim at prevention, but also at the reduction and, where practicable, elimination of pollution of the sea caused by dumping and incineration at sea.
<P>
It is believed that some will regard this as support for a limit to be placed on dumping activities altogether while others may see it as a way of opening the door for remedial action for dumping activities in the past.
<P>
The Meeting agreed that a precautionary approach to environmental protection from dumping and incineration at sea needed to be included in the protocol as a basic provision. The draft Article 111 states that Contracting Parties shall be "guided by" or "apply": <I>"a precautionary approach to environmental protection from disposal and incineration of wastes and other matter at sea whereby appropriate preventative measures are taken when there is reason to believe that substances
or energy introduced in the marine environment are likely to cause harm even when there is no conclusive evidence to prove a causal relation between inputs and their effects."</I> The final wording will be decided by the Special Meeting.
<P>
The Contracting Parties also acknowledged the usefulness of the "polluter-pays principle (PPP)" as a cost-allocation instrument when implementing the protocol, although the proposed text only amounts to a declaration of intent to apply PPP and is only confined to costs involved with issuance of permits and with enforcement of permit conditions.
<P>
The protocol could also involve acceptance of "reverse listing" instead of "black and grey lists". This means that all dumping would be strictly prohibited, with the exception of clearly identified waste categories. This concept is already incorporated into the regional context, such as the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area, 1974 (Helsinki Convention), the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft, 1972 (Oslo Convention) and the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-based Sources, 1974 (Paris Convention).
<P>
It was agreed that the area to which the Convention applies should be extended to include the "sea-bed and the sub-soil thereof". The Meeting agreed not to include internal marine waters under the definition of "sea".
<P>
It is expected that a Waste Assessment Framework will be included as an annex to the Convention. The Waste Assessment Framework is a practical and comprehensive procedure for managing waste in compliance with the Convention.
<P>
The draft text recognizes the importance of other international treaties, notably the Convention on the Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, 1989 (The Basel Convention). It proposes that Parties "shall not permit the export of wastes or other matter to other countries for dumping or incineration at sea".
<P>
The Consultative Meeting came to broad agreement on the need to strengthen implementation, compliance and enforcement provisions as a whole, which has the potential to boost the credibility of the Convention as an effective instrument to protect the marine environment.
<P>
There was also agreement to a substantial strengthening of the Convention's technical co-operation provisions, giving incentives to developing countries and countries in transition to market economies for access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and know-how and also involving clearinghouse activities by IMO.
<P>
The draft text offers a so-called period of grace of 5 years to new Parties to the protocol to achieve full compliance with specific provisions in the protocol, based on established needs. This period would involve close monitoring on one hand, but would also give an incentive to provide dedicated technical assistance to the new Party concerned.
<P>
The Consultative Meeting agreed to include the Settlement of Disputes Arrangements, which were accepted in 1978 but which have never entered into force.
<P>
Although entry into force provisions will be decided by the Conference, the Consultative Meeting agreed that the number of ratifications required should be relatively low - the figures suggested were 10 to 15.
<P>
A Technical Co-operation and Assistance Programme is being developed under the Convention to be incorporated into the IMO Integrated Technical Co-operation Programme as a tool to implement the strengthened technical co-operation provisions contained in the draft protocol.
<P>
If accepted, this Programme may involve more commitment from Contracting Parties on a bilateral or multilateral basis to provide assistance and additional input from IMO with regard to project identification, planning and development, and the submission of project proposals to Contracting Parties, donor agencies, etc.

DEFINITION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
<P>         
The Definition and Recommendations set forth in this Document
should not be interpreted as precluding the adoption of more
restrictive requirements by any Party to the Convention or
<I>appropriate</I> national authorities, pursuant to Articles IV.
3 and Vl. 3 of the Convention. Nothing in this Document shall be
construed as encouraging the dumping <I>at sea</I> of radioactive
waste or other radioactive matter.
<P>         
A. DEFINITION
<P>         
A.1. <I>Definition of High-Level
Radioactive Wastes or Other
High-Level Radioactive Matter Unsuitable for Dumping at Sea<A
HREF="#definition">[1]</A> </I>
<P>         
A. 1.1. For the purposes of Annex I to the Convention, high-level
radioactive wastes or other high-level radioactive matter
unsuitable for dumping at sea means any waste or other matter
with <I>an activity</I> per unit gross mass (in tonnes)
exceeding:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a) 1 Ci/t for alpha-emitters but limited to 10<SUP>-1</SUP>
Ci/t
for <SUP>226</SUP>Ra and supported <SUP>210</SUP>Po;
<P>         
<DD>(b) 10<SUP>2</SUP> Ci/t for /7-emitters with half-lives of at
least 0.5 years (excluding tritium) and  -emitters of unknown
half-lives; and
<P>         
<DD>(c) 10<SUP>6</SUP> Ci/t for tritium and /7-emitters with
half-lives of less than 0.5 years.
</DL>
<P>         
The above activity concentrations shall be averaged over a gross
mass not exceeding <I>1000 tonnes</I>.
<P>         
A.1.2. The Definition must not be taken to imply that material
falling outside the Definition is thereby deemed to be suitable
for dumping.
<P>         
A.1.3. Materials of activity concentrations less than those in
the above Definition shall not be dumped except in accordance 
with the provisions of the Convention, in particular Annexes II
and III thereto, and the Recommendations set out in this
Document, <I>in particular Section B.1.2.</I>
<P>        
B. THE RECOMMENDED BASIS FOR ISSUING SPECIAL PERMITS FOR
RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS LISTED IN ANNEX II TO THE CONVENTION
<P>         
B.1.    <I>Environmental Evaluation of Specific Dumping
Applications</I>
<P>         
B.1.1. The appropriate national authorities shall not grant a
special permit for dumping of radioactive waste unless a detailed
environmental and ecological assessment gives a reasonable
assurance that such dumping can be accomplished in accordance
with the objectives and provisions of the Convention and the
Recommendations set out in this Document.
<P>         
B.1.2. When granting a special permit, the appropriate national
authorities shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that the
proposed dumping operation complies with the radiation protection
requirements set forth in the IAEA Basic Safety
Standards for Radiation Protection<A HREF="#note2">[2]</A>. These
requirements are
based upon the System of dose limitation of the International
Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) which requires that:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(1) The operations should be justified by assessing their net
benefits, taking into consideration the radiation consequences
and the possibilities of alternative procedures:
<P>         
<DD>(2) The radiation protection aspects of the operation should
be optimized, keeping the resulting collective doses (including
their occupational and public components) as low as is reasonably
achievable, economic and social factors being taken into account;
and
<P>         
<DD>(3) The doses to individual members of the public should not
reach the appropriate dose limits, now or in the future. In
estimating the doses, account must be taken of other practices
which might expose the same critical population groups.
</DL>
<P>         
In particular, the upper limits to activity release rates from
all sources (other than natural sources) when released into an
ocean basin with a volume of not less than 10<SUP>17</SUP>
m<SUP>3</SUP> shall not exceed:
<P>         
<DL>         
<DD>(a) 10<SUP>5</SUP> Ci/year for a-emitters but only
10<SUP>4</SUP> Ci/year for <SUP>226</SUP>Ra and supported
<SUP>210</SUP>Po;
<P>         
<DD>(b) 10<SUP>8</SUP> Ci/year for g/-emitters with half-lives of
at least 0.5 years (excluding tritium and /7-emitters of unknown
half-lives;
<P>         
<DD>(c) 10<SUP>12</SUP> Ci/year for tritium and /-emitters with
half-lives of less than 0.5 years.
</DL>
<P>         
No special permit should be issued which would cause these limits
to be approached.
<P>         
B.1.3. It is essential that a general policy of continued
isolation and containment of radioactive waste after descent to
the sea-bed should be pursued through the use of suitable    
packaging to minimize to the extent reasonably achievable the
radioactivity which might ultimately be released, thereby
preventing unnecessary contamination of the marine environment.
<P>         
B.1.4. <I>(formerly B.1.2 in the previous Document)</I> The
environmental assessment shall include, in addition to
the factors specified in Annex III to the Convention,
consideration of:
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(1) The justification for the proposed dumping
<I>operation</I> when weighed against land-based alternatives,
including the respective population dose commitments;
<P>         
<DD>(2) The total alpha, beta and gamma activities and the
activity of any individual nuclide of special significance for
the assessment;
<P>         
<DD>(3) Those factors likely to affect significantly the movement
of radioactive materials from the dumping site to the human
environment, including the nature of the sea-bed and the physical
processes of mixing and transport in the sea at the dumping site;
<P>         
<DD>(4) Dose commitments to individual members of the public and
to the population via critical and other appropriate pathways;
<P>         
<DD>(5) The risk to marine ecosystems resulting from the release
of radioactivity from dumped packages;
<P>         
<DD>(6) The degree to which it is practical to attempt to reduce
dose commitments, either for normal dumping or in case of
accidents, by techniques such as having the radioactive material
in a relatively insoluble form or within a relatively insoluble
matrix, by designing the containment to retain for a period of
time radioactive material when it is on the sea-bed, or by
selecting an area with characteristics that will facilitate the
retention of the radioactive material in the vicinity of the
dumping site;
<P>         
<DD>(7) Operational methods to be used, including arrangements
for dealing with accidents and emergencies and methods of
verifying their correct execution.
</DL>
<P>         
B.1.5. <I>(formerly B.1.3 in the previous Document)</I> The IAEA
is
of the opinion that it is necessary that the
reports to be submitted, pursuant to Article VI.4 of the
Convention, to the <I>Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative   

Organization (IMCO)</I> include this environmental assessment in
relation to an individual application for a special permit for
dumping.
<P>         
B.2. <I>Monitoring and Assessment</I>
<P>         
B.2.1. In the context of dumping carried out in accordance with
the Convention, the following requirements shall be met:
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(1) Determination by measurement or estimation of the nature
and quantities of radioactive waste or other radioactive material
to be dumped; and
<P>         
<DD>(2) Monitoring, to the extent feasible and meaningful, of the
condition of the seas with respect to dumped radioactive wastes
in the vicinity of the dumping site, taking into full account the
relevant guidance as provided for in the IAEA
Safety Series No. 5<A HREF="#note3">[3]</A> and the ICRP
Publication 7<A HREF="#note4">[4]</A>.
</DL>
<P>
B.3.    <I>Environmental Evaluation of 'Total Dumping</I>
<P>         
B.3.1. In addition to the environmental assessment in relation to
an individual application for a special permit for dumping, the
appropriate national authorities shall take the following factors
into account in determining whether each proposed dumping
operation is acceptable:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(1) Periodic reviews of the total dumping which has been
carried out under permits issued by them;
<P>         
<DD>(2) Dumping which has been reported pursuant to the
Convention as having been carried out by other States; and
<P>         
<DD>(3) Prospective dumping which may reasonably be expected.
</DL>
<P>         
This evaluation will be facilitated through the establishment of
regional agreements and other appropriate forms of international
co-operation.
<P>       
C. THE RECOMMENDED DETAILED BASIS FOR OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF    
DUMPING WASTE
<P>         
C.1. <I>General Requirements Governing Operational Control of
Dumping of Waste</I>
<P>         
C.1.1. The dumping of liquid or unpackaged radioactive waste into
surface and shallow waters should not be authorized until such
time as the IAEA formulates appropriate recommendations governing
such dumping. The direct dumping of unpackaged liquid radioactive
waste into the deep sea shall be prohibited since such waste
would not be sufficiently dense or immiscible with sea-water to
descend to and remain on the sea-bed. The dumping of packaged
liquid radioactive waste into the deep sea is specifically
excluded pursuant to Section C.3.2.2. Solid radioactive wastes
where the radioactivity is intrinsically contained in a
relatively insoluble matrix and which can be shown not to
disperse before reaching the sea-bed, do not require packaging
and can be dumped in the deep sea under the same requirements as
for packaged solid waste.
<P>         
C.1.2. In order to make an assessment for the Definition <I>of
material which is unsuitable for dumping, a model was developed
based on a calculated upper limit to radioactivity release rates
from all sources. For operational control these calculated values
were expressed as activity per unit-gross mass in tonnes based
upon</I> an assumed dumping rate of 100 000 tonnes per year at
any site.  This assumed rate of dumping should not be interpreted
as implying that such a rate will be reached or as encouraging
such a rate. It would be prudent for the appropriate national
authorities to authorize dumping at the lowest rate which is
reasonably practicable, having regard to the development of
applications of nuclear energy.         
<P>
C.1.3. The dumping operation must be subject to strict control. A
number of factors have to be taken into consideration. They
concern, in particular, the conditioning and packaging of the
waste in order to ensure safe transport and handling, and
minimization of the risk of accidental recovery of containers
after disposal. This is covered by operational measures dealing
with the choice of a suitable dumping site, the design and
construction of waste containers, the choice of an appropriate
ship able to dispose of the waste at the given dumping site,
provisions for radiation protection of the crew, and an adequate
supervision of the dumping operations by competent escorting
officers. All these operational requirements shall, therefore, be
included in the special permits issued by the appropriate
national authorities in accordance with the Convention.
<P>
C.2. <I>Requirements for Selection of a Dumping Site</I>
<P>         
C. 2.1. In addition to the factors specified in Annex III to the
Convention, the following requirements shall be met by the
appropriate national authorities in the selection of a site for
the dumping of packaged waste:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(1) The chance of recovering the waste by processes such as
trawling shall be minimized;
<P>         
<DD>(2) Dumping shall be restricted to those areas of the oceans
between latitudes 50<SUP>o</SUP>N and 50<SUP>o</SUP>S. The area
shall have an average water depth greater than 4000 metres.
Recognizing that variations in sea-bed topography do exist, this
restriction should not be interpreted to exclude those sites
within which there are localized areas with water depths of 3600
metres;
<P>         
<DD>(3) Sites should be located clear of continental margins and
open sea islands, and not in marginal or inland seas. Nor should
they be situated in known areas of natural phenomena, for example
volcanic activity, that would make the site unsuitable for
dumping;
<P>         
<DD>(4) The area must be free from known undersea cables
currently in use,
<P>      
<DD>(5) Areas shall be avoided that have potential sea-bed
resources which may be exploited either directly by mining or by
the harvest of marine products, or indirectly (e.g. spawning) as
feeding grounds for marine organisms important to man:
<P>         
<DD>(6) The number of dumping sites shall be strictly limited;
and
<P>         
<DD>(7) The area must be suitable for the convenient conduct of
the dumping operation and so far as possible shall be chosen to
avoid the risk of collision with other traffic during
manoeuvering and undue navigational difficulties. The area chosen
should preferably be one covered by electronic navigational aids.
</DL>
<P>         
C.2.2. The dumping site shall be defined by precise co-ordinates.
In order to ensure a reasonable operational flexibility, it
should have an area <I>as small as practicable, but no larger
than</I> 10<SUP>4</SUP> square kilometres.
<P>         
C.3. <I>Special Requirements for Packages for Dumping</I>
<P>         
C. 3.1. General
<P>         
C. 3.1.1. In addition to the provisions of Article IV of the
Convention, the following requirements for conditioning,
handling, transport and immersion shall be met.
<P>         
C.3.2. Conditioning of Waste
<P>         
C.3.2.1. Waste in the package shall be either solid, solidified
or absorbed in a solid substrate.
<P>         
C.3.2.2. Waste in liquid form shall be excluded, <I>because its
rise to the surface cannot be precluded</I>. Small quantities of
liquids such as tritiated water may, however, be absorbed
<I>in</I> a material of good absorption capacity. Containers of
such absorbed liquids shall be mounted within a second enclosure
of an appropriate design.
<P>
C.3.3. Handling and Transport
<P>         
C.3.3.1. The relevant provisions of the IAEA
Transport
Regulations<A HREF="#note5">[5]</A> shall be complied with,
together with any
applicable national and international transport regulations for  
dangerous goods. In particular, the packages shall be designed to
ensure adequate containment of the waste during handling and
transport until the end of the dumping operations.
<P>         
C.3.4. Immersion
<P>         
C.3.4.1. The packages shall be designed to ensure that the
contents are retained within them during descent to the sea-bed.
To achieve this, the following requirements shall be met: 
<P>
<DL>
<DD>         
(1) The package shall have an overall specific gravity of not
less than 1.2 to ensure sinking to the sea-bed to a depth greater
than <I>4000</I> metres;
<P>         
<DD>(2) The design shall be such that any inner container will
remain on the sea-bed;
<P>         
<DD>(3) The container shall be made sufficiently strong or
pliable to remain intact and retain its contents under the
pressure encountered during descent to the sea-bed, or be
equipped with a pressure equalization system which relieves the
stress on the container; and
<P>         
<DD>(4) Buoyant material shall be excluded unless it is treated
or packaged so as either to preclude the return of such material
to surface waters or to ensure that, on its return, it  ill not
constitute a radiation hazard nor interfere materially with
fishing, navigation or other legitimate uses of the sea.
</DL>
<P>         
C.4. <I>Approval of the Ship and its Equipment</I>
<P>         
C.4.1. Certain special requirements are necessary for ships
engaged in the dumping of packaged radioactive wastes. These
requirements are set out below:

I. INTRODUCTION
<P>         
1.1.  <I>The London Dumping Convention of 1972</I>
<P>         
1.1.1. The Convention on the Prevention of
Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter
<A HREF="#text">[1]</A> was
adopted by an Intergovernmental Conference which met in London
from 30 October to 13 November 1972, at the invitation of the
Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland. The Convention was opened for signature by any State at
London, Mexico City, Moscow and Washington from 29 December 1972
until 31 December 1973 and thereafter for accession by any State.
After the entry into force of the Convention on 30 August 1975, a
meeting of the Contracting Parties to decide on organizational
matters, held in London from 17 to 19 December 1975, designated
the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO)
as the Organization responsible for Secretariat duties in
relation to the Convention. The Convention provides for control
of "any deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter from
vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea"
and any deliberate disposal of such vessels, aircraft, etc.
themselves. The prevention of marine pollution emanating from the
normal operations of vessels, aircraft, etc. or directly arising
from the exploration and exploitation of sea-bed mineral
resources is excluded from the scope of the Convention (Article
III.1).
<P>         
1.1.2. With respect to radioactive materials, the Convention
entrusts the IAEA  with specific responsibilities in the
following provisions pursuant to Article IV:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(1) In Annex I on materials prohibited from dumping, item 6
states:
<BLOCKQUOTE>         
"High-level radioactive wastes or other high-level radioactive
matter, defined on public health, biological or other grounds, by
the competent international body in this field, at present the
International Atomic Energy Agency, as unsuitable for dumping at
sea";
</BLOCKQUOTE>         
<DD>(2) In Annex II on materials requiring special care i dumping
procedures, item D states:
<BLOCKQUOTE>         
"Radioactive wastes or other radioactive matter not included in
Annex I. In the issue of permits for the dumping of this matter,
the Contracting Parties should take full account of the
recommendations of the competent international body in this
field, at present the International Atomic Energy Agency".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
<P>         
1.1.3. Article IV.1 of the Convention makes a distinction
between materials that may be dumped after the issue of a general
permit and those that may be dumped only after the issue of a
special permit. Annex II puts "radioactive wastes or other
radioactive matter" into the class requiring special permits
without, however, defining such radioactive wastes or matter.
<P>         
1.1.4.   Article IV. 3 of the Convention provides that no
provision thereof is to be interpreted as preventing a
<I>Contracting</I> Party from prohibiting, in so far as that
Party is concerned, the dumping of wastes or other matter not
listed in Annex I. Further, the content of the Annexes to the
Convention will be kept under review by consultative meetings of
the <I>Contracting</I> Parties, which will be convened not less
frequently than once every two years, or by special meetings
which may be convened at any time on the request of two thirds of
the Parties, pursuant to Article XIV. 3(a), 4(a) and 4(b) of the
Convention. Amendments to the Annexes, which will be based on
scientific and technical considerations, are subject to a
simplified procedure as compared with amendments to the basic
provisions of the Convention (Article XV.2).
<P>         
1.1.5.   Further, Article IV. 2 of the Convention provides that
all the factors specified in Annex III thereto should be given
careful consideration prior to the issue of any permit, including
prior studies of the characteristics of the dumping sites as set
forth in Sections B and C of that Annex.
<P>         
1.2.    <I>Purpose of this Annex</I>
<P>         
1.2.1. This Annex provides background material pertinent to the
specific responsibilities entrusted to the IAEA under the
Convention, namely to define "high-level radio-active wastes or
other high-level radioactive matter .... unsuitable for dumping
at sea" and to ensure that any dumping of radioactive matter into
the sea involves no unacceptable degree of hazard to man and his
environment. It provides information on the way the IAEA arrived
at the <I>revised</I> Definition and outlines the thinking behind
the Recommendations which are set out rather formally and without
elaboration in the Definition and Recommendations.
<P>         
II.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION
<P>         
2.1.    <I>Radiation Protection Principles to be applied to Waste
Management</I>
<P>         
2.1.1. The rapid development and increasing use of nuclear energy
or peaceful purposes and the expanding application of
radioisotopes in various fields of science, medicine and
technology are unavoidably associated with the production of
growing amounts of radioactive wastes. The basic principle to be
applied in the management of radioactive wastes is to protect man
and other sensitive elements of the biosphere from undue exposure
to ionizing radiation emanating from these wastes.
<P>         
2.1.2.   In selecting an appropriate waste management system it
should be verified that natural resources are protected and that
any reduction of amenities is acceptably low. Man is dependent
upon the land and the sea, and both must be protected.
<P>         
2.1.3. A balance has to be achieved between the need to find
suitable storage or disposal methods, the radiation protection of
workers and members of the public, and the overall cost involved.
The justification for dumping radioactive wastes must be viewed
in this light.
<P>         
2.1.4. The most recent applicable recommendations <I>by the
International Commission on Radiological Protection</I> (ICRP)
should be used as a guide in this area.
<P>         
2.2.    <I>Sources of Radioactivity in the Sea</I>
<P>         
2.2.1. Radioactive wastes may enter the sea through one of the
following major routes, by:
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(1) Direct dumping of the wastes into the seas and oceans;
<P>         
<DD>(2) Discharge to river systems;
<P>         
<DD>(3) Discharge to tidal estuaries;
<P>         
<DD>(4) Discharge to coastal waters;
<P>         
<DD>(5) Discharge from nuclear-powered ships; and
<P>
<DD>(6) Deposition from the atmosphere.
</DL>
<P>
2.2.2.   Some solid wastes have been dumped in packaged form
in the depths of the sea. This form of disposal has been limited
to materials with low radioactivity content for example, during
the 1967-1977 period a total of about 51 600 tonnes of packaged
solid radioactive waste, containing about 5900 curies of
a-emitters, about 190 000 curies of emitters and, additionally,
about 183 000 curies of tritium has been dumped in the north-east
Atlantic Ocean. The annual amounts dumped during that period,
expressed as fractions of the limiting release rates implied in
the Definition, never exceeded 
<P>
<DL>
<DD>1% for a-emitters
<P>         
<DD>1% for /emitters with half-lives of at least 0.5 years
(excluding tritium)
<P>         
<DD>10<SUP>-4</SUP> % for tritium 
</DL>
<P>
and only twice approached 10% of the assumed upper limit to the
mass dumping rate.
<P>         
2.2.3.   Unlike many of the stresses presently confronting man,
radiation and radioactivity have always been a part of man's
environment. Studies by the United Nations  Scientific Committee
on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) show that the
present doses to humans of naturally occurring radiation lie
generally in the range of 100 mrem/yr to 300 mrem/yr  with doses
in a few areas exceeding 1000 mrem/yr. The main contributions to
this exposure are radioactive materials in the earth's crust,
cosmic radiation and natural radioactivity in the human body
(mainly <SUP>40</SUP>K).
<P>         
2.2.4. The marine environment contains a wide range of natural
radionuclides mainly <SUP>40</SUP>K, <SUP>87</SUP>Rb, members of
the uranium and
thorium series, and <SUP>14</SUP>C and <SUP>3</SUP>H. The total
activity in all of the
sea (mainly <SUP>40</SUP>K) amounts to rather more than 300
Ci/km<SUP>3</SUP>
or nearly 500 000 MCi in total. Radium alone accounts for more
than 1000 MCi. The doses to marine organisms are usually of the
order of 10 mrad/yr to 100 mrad/yr.
<P>         
2.2.5. Though the total naturally occurring radioactive content
of the sea is very large, this does not provide a sure basis for
determining what quantities of radioactivity may be added in
local areas without leading to unacceptable additional exposures
to man or the marine environment. Though such additions may be
relatively small in quantity, the hazards associated with
localized releases of wastes must be assessed and considerable
care exercised, as contemplated by the Convention, in disposing
of any radioactive wastes into the marine environment.
<P>         
2.2.6. Man has been dealing with radioactive materials in
artificially concentrated or artificially produced forms for
nearly three quarters of a century and has been generating
electrical power from nuclear fission for over a decade. Man has
also released radioactive material as the result of several
series of nuclear explosions.
<P>         
2.2.7.   These operations have all resulted in some radionuclides
being released into the environment, including the sea. Apart
from short-lived <I>radionuclides</I> close to the scene of
nuclear
explosions, the quantities released to the sea so far amount to
some hundreds of megacuries from explosions and a few megacuries
from nuclear operations. To date, civilian nuclear power
programmes have accounted for only a small fraction of these
latter releases. These quantities amount to less than one
thousandth (10<SUP>-3</SUP>) of the natural activity in the sea.
This fraction gives an indication of the relative magnitudes, but
no such simple comparison of activities can indicate the relative
biological importance of the different <I>radionuclides. They</I>
have very widely ranging toxicities, and their significance in a
given environment depends not only on this fact but also on their
distribution and on the uses made of that environment
<P>         
2.3. <I>Basis of the Definition (High-Level Radioactive Wastes or
Other High-Level Radioactive Matter Unsuitable for Dumping at
Sea)</I>
<P>         
2.3.1. The Definition<A HREF="#annex_2">[2]</A> identifies
material, the radioactive content of which is at such a level
that the Parties to the Convention would wish to prevent any
participating State from issuing a special permit even after a
detailed appraisal of the safety of the proposed operation, and
even for the sector of the <I>marine environment furthest removed
from man</I>, i.e. the deep sea with depth greater than <I>4000
metres</I>. The Definition also covers those waste which <I>have
relatively high concentrations of radioactivity</I> and have been
generally recognized by the
appropriate national authorities as being unsuitable for dumping,
for example the "first cycle wastes" from nuclear reprocessing,
irradiated fuel and irradiated fuel cladding. The Definition must
not be so permissive that regular and repeated operations
somewhat below the defined level would endanger man or his
environment, even though each individual operation had been
conducted with appropriate care. The Definition has, therefore,
been based on the concept of the limiting capacity of the deep
oceans to receive radioactive waste, which capacity is based on
the annual input of radioactivity which will result in individual
dose commitments via the critical pathways equal to the dose
limits for individual members of the public recommended by the
ICRP. <A HREF="#annex_*">*</A>
<P>         
2.3.2. The limiting capacity of the oceans to receive radioactive
waste has been extensively reviewed by a series of Consultants'
Meetings and Advisory Group Meetings convened by the IAEA during
1976-1978.
<P>         
2.3.2.1. The IAEA convened two Consultants' Meetings to review
the Oceanographic Basis of the Provisional Definition and
Recommendations: one at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,
Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA, in December 1976, and the other
at the Fisheries Laboratory, Lowestoft, United Kingdom, in
February 1977. A Working Paper prepared by the two Consultants'
Meetings was used as a basis for discussions at an Advisory Group
Meeting, which was held at IAEA Headquarters, Vienna, in March
1977, to review the oceanographic basis. The meeting was attended
by 25 experts from 12 countries and 4 international
organizations.
<P>         
2.3.2.2. In keeping with the recommendations of the Advisory
Group on the Oceanographic Basis, the IAEA convened in June 1977
a Consultants' Meeting to review the radiological basis, at IMCO
Headquarters, London. The consultants considered the conclusions
and recommendations of the Advisory Group on the Oceanographic
Basis as the primary guidelines and also took into account the
comments expressed at the First Consultative Meeting of the
Contracting Parties to the London Dumping Convention<A
HREF="#annex_3">[3]</A>, which was
held at IMCO Headquarters, London, from 20 to 24 September 1976.
<P>         
2.3.2.3. The conclusions of these meetings, which were laid down
in two reports <A HREF="#report4">[4]</A>, <A
HREF="#report5">[5]</A>, were further reviewed by an Advisory
Group Meeting, held in Vienna in March 1978. This meeting was
attended by 42 experts from 24 countries and 3 international
organizations. A summary of the conclusions concerning the
oceanographic basis, the radiological assessment, and the
implications for the Definition and Recommendations required by
the London Dumping Convention is given below.
<P>         
2.3.3.   The present knowledge of oceanic processes is
insufficient for the construction of a single comprehensive model
to describe the movement of radionuclides released on the ocean
bottom through the marine environment. Limiting calculations have
thus been made separately for the long- and short-term transports
of radionuclides in the ocean. These calculations have been made
assuming a continuous release of radionuclides from the deep
ocean over periods as long as 40 000 years which is commensurate
with the half-life of <SUP>239</SUP>Pu.
<P>         
2.3.3.1. The physical processes which could transport material in
the short term from the deep sea to where interactions would
occur with man's food chain on the time scale of months to years
are not well understood. On the basis of two calculations which
have been made for different possible mechanisms, it is
recommended however that, for the continuous release of 1 Ci/yr
from a single deep-sea dumping site, the waster concentration at
the place of interaction with man's food chain be taken to be
10<SUP>-6</SUP> Ci/m<SUP>3</SUP> and that site specific
calculations only be used if they result in larger
concentrations.         
<P>
2.3.3.2. For those radionuclides whose half-lives are longer than
the mixing time of a finite ocean basin, for example
<SUP>239</SUP>Pu, the well-mixed average concentration, including
decay, provides a more reliable estimate of the water
concentration than that given above for short-term processes. For
these long-lived radionuclides, this finite basin concentration
is greater than that specified above for the short-term processes
and determines both the permissible release rate from a single
site and from all sites in an ocean basin.
<P>         
2.3.3.3. At intermediate time scales, especially for those
radionuclides with half-lives similar to such time scales,
oceanographic modelling of the transport of radionuclides is
perhaps the most difficult. For these time scales it has been
considered reasonable, however, for releases from a single site
to use the concentrations given above for short-term processes
since it is unlikely intermediate time scale processes could lead
to larger concentrations.
<P>         
2.3.3.4. For the estimation of the total permissible release rate
in a finite ocean basin from all sites a model by Shepherd
(1976)<A HREF="#shepherd">[6]</A> has been recommended for all
time scales. This model
gives the correct long-term finite basin fuel-mixed average
concentration and is taken to have some validity at intermediate
and short time scales. The isolation of man and his food chain
from bottom water cannot be guaranteed due to biological pathways
short circuiting the physical transport of radioactivity. Bottom
water concentrations must therefore be limited to levels which
will be acceptable in surface waters. For the hazard assessment
the water concentration used in all cases is the bottom water
concentration calculated from the Shepherd model using a vertical
diffusion coefficient of 1 cm<SUP>2</SUP>/yr.
<P>         
2.3.3.5, In general, the long-term large-scale processes lead to
a release rate limit from all sites in a basin, whereas
short-term small-scale processes lead to a limit which applies to
a single-site only. The single-site release rate is more
restrictive for short-lived radionuclides and in this case
partitioning of waste between sites can increase the overall
limit for the basin as a whole, For long-lived radionuclides, the
long-term basin release rate is more restrictive and partitioning
of wastes between sites does not affect the limit for the basin
as a whole, Indeed, in this case, it is clear that the input of
radionuclides into the basin from all sources, including those
from other than the dumping of radioactive wastes, must be
included in any assessment of the release rate limit.
<P>         
2.3.3.6. Partition of radionuclides between water and sediment
will result in reduced concentrations in a particular medium. In
the hazard assessment no allowance was made for the removal of
radionuclides to one pathway when considering the other.
<P>         
2.3.3.7. Since estimates made of the transfer through the water
column from a dump site were principally based on knowledge of
processes in the large-scale anticyclonic oceanic gyres, they are
not applicable to marginal seas or to the poleward side of the
major oceanic gyres where deep convection or regions of low
stability may result in more intense exchanges.
<P>         
2.3.3.8. Keeping in mind both our present level of understanding
of oceanic processes and the attempt at generality in the
oceanographic basis, it is concluded that, for the continuous    
release of radionuclides in the deep ocean, the initial
concentration at the source is unlikely to be important in
determining the hazard to man; for long-lived radionuclides,    
calculated release rates must be interpreted as those arising
from all sources in an ocean  basin, whether these sources arise
from dumping operations or other activities; and, finally, that
future knowledge could result in estimates of release rates being
revised either upward or downward.
<P>         
2.3.4. In the radiological assessment, release rate limits were
derived for individual nuclides using the oceanographic basis as
described in 2.3.3 and postulating a number of representative
pathways by which man might become exposed to radiation after
release of radionuclides on the sea bed, resulting from dumping
operations.
<P>         
2.3.4.1. Pathways leading to exposure of man were selected to
include some which are known to exist and some which may become
important in the future. While the selected pathways are
generalized representations they are thought to provide
reasonable estimates of the maximum rates of transfer of
radioactivity to man by a variety of mechanisms. It was intended
that the parameters selected for the pathways should be
sufficiently general to cover population groups which could
become critical in various areas in the world. It is not
necessarily the case that unforeseen pathways will involve
significant changes;
it is probable that they will be covered in the essentials of one
of the selected pathways. The assessment evaluated each pathway
independently; however, where it appeared likely that members of
one critical group could also become members of another critical
group the calculated limits have been reduced accordingly. Twelve
pathways were selected, five of which involve the consumption of
sea food. The latter pathways are not intended to represent
particular species but examples of general fishery resource
pathways. The consumption rates used in this assessment are not
actual rates but reflect assumed maximum rates. In four pathways
the exposure of beach dwellers was considered. Since critical
groups of this type are likely to be exposed to all four
pathways, a combined limit was calculated. Three additional
pathways covering miscellaneous practices such as bathing, the
use of desalinated sea-water as drinking water and the use      
of sea salt for domestic needs were considered and combined.
<P>         
2.3.4.2. The release rate limits derived for the various pathways
were based on the ICRP dose limits for individual members of the
public. The philosophy underlying the procedure and the use of
critical groups is presented in ICRP publications. It should be
stressed that ICRP dose limits provide a lower boundary of an
unacceptable range of values. Values above the ICRP limits are
specifically to be avoided while values up to the limit are not
automatically permitted. The ICRP limits should be considered as
constraints for optimization procedures, which usually would
result in radiation doses much lower than the dose limits. On the
other hand, the dose limits are not thresholds above which
undesirable effects begin to appear, but represent dose values
corresponding to individual risks approaching unacceptable
levels.
<P>         
2.3.4.3. The maximum permissible annual intakes (MPAI)
corresponding to the dose limits were taken from the IAEA Basic
Safety Standards for Radiation Protection
<A HREF="#note7">[7]</A>. Pathways that
included the ingestion of radionuclides  which were transported
through sea-water were based on MPAIs for soluble forms of the
particular radionuclide. In the case of inhalation, the most
restrictive MPAIs have been used. The concentration factors     
used for each radionuclide in this assessment were obtained from
a number of publications. Where factors were not available for
certain elements or the potential pathways could not be
specifically identified, for example, deep ocean living
cephalopods, comparable values based on similar chemical elements
or species with similar behaviour were assumed.
<P>         
2.3.4.4. In the selection of radionuclides for the assessment,
consideration was given to those that were expected to occur in
wastes likely to be dumped at sea, including fission products,
activation products and actinides with half-live of more than a  
few days. The selection included some radionuclides which would
not normally arise in wastes from the nuclear fuel cycle but
which might arise from other sources.
<P>         
2.3.4.5. It should be noted that since the objective of the
radiological assessment was to derive release rate limits, and
since these by definition are related directly to the ICRP dose
limits, assessment of collective doses or collective dose
commitments as not done. This assessment would be appropriate for
the optimization procedures recommended by
ICRP<A HREF="#note8">[8]</A> and is a
requirement when granting a special permit for dumping of
radioactive  waste (see B.1.2 of the Recommendations).
<P>         
2.3.4.6. The permissible damage to the marine ecosystems due to
dumping operations was considered and it was concluded that the
radiation doses arising as a result of releases within the limits
of the Definition are not expected to lead to significant adverse
effects to populations as a whole.
<P>         
2.3.5. Release rate limits were derived for individual
radionuclides. For the sake of administrative convenience and
analytical simplicity the radionuclides were grouped into three
categories according to the basic properties of decay type and
half-life. The groupings and the appropriate release rate limits
are:

<P>          
The release rate limits represent the limit of the most
restrictive radionuclide in the particular group with two
exceptions. It was concluded, however, that these exceptions
could be included in their natural place in the grouping, either
because the calculations are considered quite conservative
because of unrealistic assumptions or because the relative
amounts compared to other radionuclides of importance are known
to be small. <A HREF="#report5">[5]</A>
<P>         
2.3.6. In the Provisional Definition and Recommendations two
explicit safety factors of 10<SUP>2</SUP> were applied to the
calculated release rate limits to allow for:
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(a) The possible presence of more than one dumping site; and
<P>         
<DD>(b) The fact that certain areas of the ocean may have
characteristics less favourable than those assumed in the
assessment.
</DL>
<P>         
2.3.6.1. In the present assessment explicit account has been
taken of the possibility of multiple-sites by preparing estimates
both for single-sites and for a finite ocean volume. <A
HREF="#report4">[4]</A> The
oceanographic basis has also been constructed to take account of
possible extreme events in ocean areas so that the model is
insensitive to detailed parameter values in any particular ocean
area. It is therefore not appropriate to apply safety factors for
the same reasons to the present assessment.
<P>         
2.3.6.2. A review of the way in which the assessment was made
reveals that where specific data were not available conservative
assumptions were used in the calculations and this could result
in a substantial safety factor<A HREF="#report5">[5]</A>. Its
numerical value depends on
the particular radionuclide and set of circumstances and can
neither be determined precisely nor be guaranteed. Certain
important considerations, such as exposure of the critical  
group from more than one pathway or radionuclide and the possible
existence of unforeseen pathways from the deep ocean to man, were
taken into account. There was an attempt at all stages to make
the results of the assessment as general as possible. Therefore,
the release rates given above were adopted without modification
as being the best possible estimates which can be made for them
at the present time.
<P>         
2.3.7.   To meet the objectives of the Convention it is
necessary to express the Definition in terms of a concentration
(radioactivity per unit mass). The revised definition has
therefore been based on the release rate limits for a single-site
and an assumed upper limit on mass dumping rate at a single-site
of 100 000 tonnes/year. This leads directly to the concentration
limits given below:
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(a) 1 Ci/t for alpha-emmiters but limited to 10<SUP>-1</SUP>
Ci/t for <SUP>226</SUP>Ra and
supported <SUP>210</SUP>Po;
<P>         
<DD>(b) 10<SUP>2</SUP> Ci/t for e/1-emitters with half-lives of
at least 0.5 years (excluding tritium) and mixtures of
B/-e'mitters of unknown half-lives;
<P>         
<DD>(c) 10<SUP>6</SUP> Cit for tritium and  emitters with
half-lives less than 0.5 years.
</DL>
<P>         
2.3.8.  The assumption of 100 000 tonnes/year is arbitrary and
the radiological hazards would not be materially altered if the
concentration figures were to be revised upward (or downward)
provided the release rate limits are observed.
<P>         
2.3.9.   The necessity to limit releases to finite ocean basins
(i. e. effectively to limit the number of sites per ocean basin)
has been met by an addition to paragraph B.1.2 of the
Recommendations which imposes the release rate limits for a
finite ocean volume of 10<SUP>17</SUP> m<SUP>3</SUP>. The
Definition and Recommendations have therefore been constructed so
that the single-site release rate limits are incorporated via the
combination of initial concentration of radioactivity and the
mass dumping rate. The finite ocean volume release rate limits
are incorporated as part of the Recommendations.
<P>         
2.3.10. <I>(paragraph 2.3.6 in the previous Document)</I>  In
practice, it is expected that areas selected for
dumping will be specially chosen as having favourable
characteristics. This fact, together with the <I>way in which    

the assessment was made</I>, ensures that man and his environment
should be protected if wastes of higher total activity than this
are prohibited from dumping. <I>Moreover, other wastes shall only
be disposed of at sea in accordance with special permits issued
by the appropriate national authorities alter ensuring that the
proposed dumping  operations comply with the radiation protection
requirements as in paragraph B.1.2 and after proper assessment of
the possible environmental impact.</I>
<P>         
2.3.11.  <I>(paragraph 2.3.10 in the previous document;
paragraphs 2.3.8 and 2.3.9 in the previous Document were no
longer appropriate and have been deleted)</I> The use of these
concentration limits would cause the
annual limits stated above to be approached only if the rate of
dumping at any one site approached 100 000 tonnes per year and if
all this material had an activity concentration close to the
concentration limits. The <I>assumed</I> annual dumping rate at
each site will be reviewed by <I>IMCO</I> and by the IAEA. The
appropriateness of the Definition in the light of actual dumping
rates will be kept under review by the IAEA.
<P>         
2.3.12.  For operational purposes it is necessary to average the
limiting values over a substantial mass of waste. It is
recommended that the limiting concentration in the Definition be
taken to be the average over a mass not exceeding <I>1000
tonnes</I>. Expressing the Definition as an activity <I>per unit
gross mass</I> averaged over a small fraction of the assumed
annual dumping rate should result in keeping the total activity
dumped annually below the <I>calculated</I> annual <I>release
rate</I> limits.
<P>         
2.3.13. The Definition must not be taken to imply that material
in which the concentration of radioactivity is below that
specified in the Definition is thereby deemed to be suitable for
dumping. No radioactive material may be dumped except in
accordance with the provisions of the Convention, in particular
Annexes II and III thereto, and with the Recommendations set out
in this Document.
<P>         
2.3.14. It should be noted that no material is totally devoid of
radioactivity. However, it is clearly not the intention of the
Convention that every material should be treated as a potential
radioactive pollutant and the competent authorities of the
<I>Contracting</I> Parties will wish to define some "de minimis"
level of specific activity below which a material will not be
regarded as "radioactive" for the purposes of the Convention. No
such numbers are suggested at this time and some flexibility of
interpretation is therefore left to the appropriate national
authorities. Although not derived for the purpose of dumping,
some guidance may be found in the levels set forth for exemption
of radioactive materials from regulatory control in various
international and national standards and regulations; such levels
are generally within an order of magnitude of 10<SUP>-3</SUP>
Ci/t.
<P>         
2.4. <I>Environmental Evaluation of Specific Dumping
Applications</I>
<P>         
2.4.1. The appropriate national authorities may grant a special
permit for dumping of radioactive waste only after a detailed
environmental and ecological assessment gives a reasonable
assurance that such dumping can be accomplished in accordance
with the objectives and provisions of the Convention
<P>         
2.4.2. At the levels of radioactive materials which may be
dumped under the terms of he Definition, the present state of
knowledge, cautiously interpreted, should provide a satisfactory
basis for environmental assessments. There is a substantial body
of relevant scientific literature, including publications of the
IAEA (e g. the Safety Series, the Technical Reports Series and
the Symposium Proceedings), ICRP and UNSCEAR. In carrying out
these environmental assessments it should not be necessary for
the
appropriate national authorities to require that detailed field
and experimental studies undertaken in every case. <I>Dumping
sites provide an opportunity for studying the interactions of
radionuclides with deep sea sediments and organisms. The IAEA
recommended that these studies be carried out where appropriate
and practical to obtain knowledge for future practices and
needs.</I>
<P>         
2.5. <I>Monitoring and Assessment</I>
<P>         
2.5.1. Article VI. l(c) and (d) of the Convention requires that
the appropriate national authorities:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>         
(1) Keep records of the nature and quantities of all matter
permitted to be dumped and the location, time and method of
dumping; and
<P>        
<DD>(2) Monitor individually, or in collaboration with other
parties and competent international organizations, the condition
of the seas for the purposes of the Convention.
</DL>
<P>         
2.5.2. As detailed in the relevant guidance provided by the IAEA
publications (particularly IAEA Safety Series
No. 5<A HREF="#note9">[9]</A>) and ICRP
Publication 7<A HREF="#note10">[10]</A>, the general objectives
of environmental
monitoring prorammes are as follows:
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(1) The assessment of actual or potential exposure of man and
other sensitive elements of the biosphere, or estimation of upper
limits of such exposure; these assessments or estimations may be
needed in relation to regulator functions:
<P>         
<DD>(2) Scientific investigations;
<P>         
<DD>(3) Improved public understanding;
<P>         
<DD>(4) <I>Conservation of ocean resources</I>.
</DL>
<P>         
In the context of dumping carried out in accordance with the
Convention and the Recommendations set out in the Document, it is
unlikely that exposure assessment objectives could be entirely
fulfilled by direct environmental monitoring. The use of other
less direct methods (<I>e.g. modelling calculations</I>) could
provide more precise estimates. <I>However, environmental
monitoring combined with research can provide information testing
the validity of present assumptions and help to provide a sound
scientific basis for the conservation of ocean resources and for
future monitoring operations and an improved technical basis for
evaluating future practices. These studies should be carried
out.</I>
<P>         
2.6.    <I>Environmental Evaluation of Total Dumping</I>
<P>         
2.6.1. In addition to evaluating individual applications for
permits for dumping, the appropriate national authorities should
make periodic reviews of the total dumping which has been carried
out under permits issued by them. They should also consider the
dumping which has been carried out by other States. Further, they
should consider prospective dumping which ma reasonably be
expected. It is desirable that a comparable international review
also be carried out. Such reviews, after considering the past and
     
prospective quantities dumped, their locations, the significant
operating experience as reported by escorting officers and the
findings of pertinent oceanographic and ecological  research,
could lead the IAEA to update the Recommendations <I>set out in
the Document.</I>
<P>         
2.6.2. In addition to these reviews the <I>Contracting</I>
Parties to the Convention are required by Article VI. 4 to report
in detail to <I>IMCO</I> the special permits issued and the
nature and quantities of all matter permitted to be dumped,
together with the location, time and method of dumping. National
records are expected to contain all the information necessary
for such reporting as well as for the establishment of an
international register. The environmental assessment is
considered a necessary part of this information.
<P>         
2.7. <I>General Principles Governing Operational Control of
Dumping of Waste</I>
<P>         
2.7.1. Provisions to be considered in establishing criteria for
the issue of permits for dumping are set out in Annex III to the
Convention. The general principles for control of dumping of
radioactive waste are provided for in the IAEA's
Safety Series
No. 5<A HREF="#note8">[8]</A>. At present, dumping almost always
takes place in the
deep sea in packages with the waste either solid, solidified or
absorbed in a solid substrate. The dumping of radioactive waste
into surface and shallow waters from vessels, aircraft,
platforms, etc. may also be envisaged under the Convention; this
could involve higher exposure to man than dumping into the deep
sea. However, such dumping is expected to be rare in practice
and, pending the development of data concerning the nature,
extent and potential effects of such operations, the IAEA has not
yet formulated any specific recommendations for the operational
conduct of such disposal. In the opinion of the IAEA, solid or
packaged radioactive wastes should not be dumped into shallow
waters because of the risk of accidental recovery of the
material. The Recommendations are, therefore, limited to deep sea
dumping.<A HREF="#delete">*</A>
<P>         
2.7.2. In addition to the movement of the radioactivity through
ecosystems, other factors have to be taken into consideration in
assessing the acceptability of a proposed dumping operation. The
concern, in particular, the conditioning of the waste in order
to ensure safe transport and handling and the risk of an
accidental recovery of <I>packaged waste</I> after dumping. This
is covered by operational measures dealing with the design  and
construction of waste containers, <I>the required forms of solid
waste (see paragraph 2.9.4.4)</I>, the choice of a suitable
dumping site, the choice of an appropriate ship able to dispose
of the  waste in the given dumping site, provisions for radiation
protection of the creu and an adequate supervision of the dumping
operations by competent escorting officers. All these operational
measures should, therefore, be included in the special permits
issued by the appropriate national authorities in accordance with
the Convention.
<P>         
2.8.    <I>Factors Affecting the Choice of a Dumping Site</I>
<P>         
2.8.1. In the selection of marine areas to be utilized as dumping
sites for packaged wastes, consideration must be given primarily
to the factors affecting the safety of man and his environment
and secondly to economic considerations.
<P>         
2.8.2. In general, the first step in an evaluation will involve
the selection from a number of possible sites of those apparently
most suited for safe disposal of packaged or solid wastes. Among
the factors which must be considered in such a site selection
are:
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(1) The probability of accidental recovery of packaged or
solid waste by man. A site would not be suitable for packaged or
solid waste disposal unless it were highly improbable that
accidental recovery would occur; the selection of shallow waters
for dumping is therefore considered to be unacceptable;
<P>         
<DD>(2) The possible utilization of the sea-bed site by man
directly in the harvest of marine products, or indirectly in the
use made of the area by organisms which are harvested by man for
food in adjacent areas;
<P>         
<DD>(3) The nature of bottom sediments with respect to the uptake
of the activity from the water and impact damage to packages;
<P>         
<DD>(4) Transport by deep-sea currents from the dumping site with
particular concern for the shoreward-directed flow;
<P>         
<DD>(5) Rate of turbulent diffusion in the waters <I>in the
vicinity</I> of the dumping site;
<P>        
<DD>(6) Rate of exchange of waters of the particular marine
sub-division containing the dumping site with other sub-divisions
of the marine environment.
</DL>
<P>         
2.8.3. It is evident that dumping sites must be selected in areas
not used for bottom trawling or other types of bottom fishing and
which are unsuited for future utilization. Areas crossed by
sub-marine cables in current use are likewise undesirable. In
general, dumping sites located in the deep sea should be in areas
where there is a low rate of exchange of the deep waters with the
surface layers and with the waters of any adjacent continental
shelf. Thus, sub-marine canyons located on the edge of the
continental shelf are generally less suited for dumping sites
than the deep waters in the true ocean basins, since the deep
waters of the canyons more readily exchange with the waters of
the continental shelf. As regions of deep convection exist to the
poleward side of the major oceanic gyres, these requirements are
best satisfied by the selection of sites in water having depths
of 4000 m or more situated between latitudes 50<SUP>o</SUP>N and
50<SUP>o</SUP>S. Sites
should be located clear of continental margins and open sea
islands and not in marginal or inland seas. Nor should they be
situated in known areas of natural phenomena, for example
volcanic activity; that would make such a site unsuitable for
dumping.
<P>         
2.8.4.   The importance of the sea and sea bed for resource
development in the future can hardly be seen in accurate
perspective today. They are likely however to be used on an
increasing scale to obtain the mineral and food resources needed
by mankind. Before selecting a dumping site studies should
therefore be carried out to assess possible future resource
development in the area concerned. The conduct of such studies
could well be co-ordinated by an appropriate international
organization. It would also seem desirable  to agree
internationally to approved dumping sites. Concern about the
future exploitation of the sea would also make it prudent to keep
the total number of dumping sites as limited as practicable.
<P>         
2.9.    <I>Special Requirements for Packages for Dumping</I>
<P>         
2.9.1. General
<P>         
2.9.1.1. It is essential that packages of radioactive matter
permitted to be dumped under the provisions of the Convention
meet certain minimal requirements to ensure that the packages may
be handled and transported safely and that upon immersion the
waste materials reach the sea bed without being released.
<P>         
2.9.1.2. When dealing with radioactive waste of the levels that
may be permitted to be dumped the protection of man and the
marine environment does not depend upon the long-term integrity
of the packaging. However, packages so designed that their
contents are retained during descent to the sea bed will
generally remain intact for a period of time after they have
reached the bottom. The packages will, however, eventually
release some or all of their radioactive contents. When
considering whether to issue a special permit for a specific site
the appropriate national authorities should ensure that the
concentration of radioactivity in the vicinity of the package
does not present any unacceptable risk to man or the marine
ecosystem.
<P>
2.9.1.3. To meet essential packaging requirements the
considerations set forth in paragraphs 2.9.2 to 2.9.8.2
below apply.
<P>         
2.9.2. Conditioning
<P>         
2.9.2.1. The radioactive waste within the packages should be in a
form which, even in the case of containers which may be damaged
or corroded, will as far as possible prevent a release and
subsequent spreading of the radioactive material; this is
particularly important to ensure safe handling and transport.
Therefore, it is essential that the radioactive  waste permitted
to be dumped be in a form either solid, solidified or absorbed
on a solid. The waste may be incorporated into a solid packaged
matrix such as cement, concrete or bitumen, forming a single
block (monolithic design of the package) or packaged separately
and assembled in a concrete vessel or a metal drum (multistage
design of the overall package). Liquid wastes should be excluded.
However, small quantities of liquids such as tritiated water may
be absorbed on a material of good absorption capacity and then
dumped as packages containing solid substrate.
<P>         
2.9.3. Transport
<P>         
2.9.3.1. The transport of radioactive  waste should be in
accordance with the IAEA Transport
Regulations<A HREF="#note11">[11]</A> and any other
applicable international and national transport regulations, in
particular when the radioactive waste has other hazardous
characteristics such as explosiveness, innammability,
pyrophoricity, chemical toxicity and corrosiveness. The IAEA
Transport Regulations include provisions for special
arrangements when the package design or shipment conditions do
not comply in all respects with the standard requirements. This
system of special arrangements is the one most likely to be used
for dealing with the transport of waste for dumping.
<P>         
2.9.4. Packaging Materials
<P>         
2.9.4.1. It can be expected that packages containing radioactive
waste will be made of dense material and that they will be made
strong enough for safe handling. For the purpose of dumping it
may be desirable to have the additional quality of some
resistance to attack by sea-water.
<P>         
2.9.4.2. Steel drums are frequently used for forming concrete
containers and both the concrete and the steel can be regarded as
protective. It is desirable that concrete used in packaging be of
good quality and of low porosity if it is intended to resist
breakage on impact with the sea bed and to withstand the
destructive action of sea-water. It should not be regarded merely
as weighting material. When concrete alone is used the thickness
of the concrete between the  waste and the outer surface should
be sufficient to prevent rupture of the package on impact if this
is required. Other suitable material can be used to provide the
needed weight.
<P>         
2.9.4.3. Baled radioactive waste which is not provided with a
containment system should not be dumped.
<P>         
2.9.4.4. Some forms of waste material are such that radioactivity
is intrinsically well contained within the waste form itself
(e.g. a metal matrix in which induced activity is fixed). When it
can be shown that wastes in such forms will reach the ocean bed
intact without dispersion of their radionuclide contents they
should be considered to conform to the requirements for the
dumping of packaged solid radioactive waste.

<P>         
2.9.5. Specific Gravity
<P>         
2.9.5.1  All packaged <I>solid radioactive</I> waste disposed of
into the sea must be sufficiently dense to sink immediately.
This condition should not be difficult to meet since the specific
gravity of sea-water at sea level does not exceed about 1.03
However, precautions must be taken to see that the contents of a
broken package will not rise to the surface. It is expected that
light materials, such as cloth and paper, would be incorporated
into concrete within the outer protective containment system, and
the overall specific gravity of all packages disposed of in deep
waters would not be less than 1.2. Packages and their contents
should be sufficiently dense to ensure that they are not readily
moved along the sea bed by currents. Should inner containers be
incorporated into the principal container the design must be such
that they will remain on the sea bed.
<P>         
2.9.6. Voids
<P>         
2.9.6.1. If a package containing voids or compressible materials
is dumped in deep water it will collapse due to the hydrostatic
pressure unless there is provision for equalizing the pressure
between interior and exterior, or the container is made
sufficiently strong or pliable to retain its contents under the
pressure encountered during descent to the sea bed.
<P>         
2.9.7. Strength against Impact
<P>         
2.9.7.1. Packaged wastes will suffer impact at the surface of the
sea and again when they hit the bottom. Designers should take
this into account.
<P>         
2.9.8. Contents
<P>         
2.9.8.1. Material in the package should comply with the relevant
criteria and conditions set forth in the Annexes to the
Convention.
<P>         
2.9.8.2. The package should exclude buoyant material unless it is
treated or packaged so as either to preclude the return of such
material to surface waters or to ensure that, on its return, it
will not constitute a radiation hazard nor interfere materially
with fishing, navigation or other legitimate uses of the sea.
Among the materials which might thus be disposed of polyethylene
is one of the few which are permanently buoyant and which thus
present a special risk of return to the surface, especially when
used in the form of closed bottles. The presence of polyethylene
in containers for dumping would be acceptable only in the
following cases:
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(a) When thin polyethylene sheeting is used to protect the
inside surface of the containers against corrosion;
<P>         
<DD>(b) When the material is processed, for example by shredding,
granulating, or cutting into small Fragments; and
<P>         
<DD>(c) Where it can be guaranteed that the specific gravity of
an inner polyethylene container and its contents is not less than
1.2, provided the contents have been solidified by an acceptable
method (e. g. with cement).
</DL>
<P>         
2.10. <I>International Co-operation and Observation</I>
<P>         
2.10.1. The IAEA welcomes the undertaking provided for by Article
VIII of the Convention with respect to the conclusion of regional
agreements for the prevention of pollution, especially by
dumping. This seems particularly necessary in considering
environmental monitoring and the need for the appropriate
national authorities to be aware of the sites used and the
quantities disposed of in the dumping carried out by other   
States, as discussed in paragraph 2.6.1 above.
<P>         
2.10.2. International co-operation in the selection of dumping
sites and international observation of dumping operations have
been suggested. International or multilateral observation is
considered desirable to establish to the satisfaction of all
parties concerned that dumping involving radioactive materials is
carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Convention
and the Definition and Recommendations of the IAEA. For
instance, such observation is provided for under the Multilateral
Consultation and Surveillance Mechanism for Sea Dumping of
Radioactive Waste, established within the framework of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on 22 July
1977.

IAEA regional projects can sometimes be extended as part of
a regional co-operative agreement. 
<P>
 A current example is ARCAL assuming control for Agency
activities to upgrade aging medical instruments in the region. A
large number of the Gamma cameras used in medical centres in Latin
America need to be upgraded. A survey completed in late 1994 found
that 261 of 723 cameras used in diagnostics were not up to
present standards.
<P>
A TC Model Project launched this year will upgrade 91
of the problem cameras in public hospitals. The project will
demonstrate and transfer Agency technology, which is based on the
personal computer, interface cards and portable image processing
software, to counterpart institutes who will do the upgrading.
That leaves two-thirds of the poor performing instruments
in need of attention. The new technology can be used by ARCAL
members  - sixteen of them now are participating in the IAEA
Model Project  - to upgrade the other 170 cameras. 
<P>
The costs are modest. A 20-year-old unit, mothballed for
eight years, was returned to clinical service in Argentina at a
cost of only US $3000. 
<P>
But project funds are short and new support must be
found from governments and private clinics, within and beyond the
region. This is now the objective of the ARCAL project, to find the
funds and deploy the needed regional expertise and complete the
job.

<h3>About Keep America Beautiful, Inc.</h3>
<p>Keep America Beautiful, Inc. (KAB) is a non-profit, public
education and community improvement organization with local
affiliates throughout North America that is committed to
preserving the natural beauty, environment and resources of
America and improving waste handling at the community level. A
leader in <em><strong>litter prevention, community improvement</strong></em>
and <em><strong>beautification</strong></em> since its founding
in 1953, KAB is also a respected educator on solid waste and its
effective management. KAB's chief objective is the support and
enhancement of the quality of life in American communities
through a structured, systematic, <em>community-based</em> and <em>results-oriented</em>
program known as the KAB SYSTEM that helps communities prevent
litter, encourage community beautification and generate ongoing
support for integrated waste management. </p>
<p>Today, over 76 million Americans are <em>directly</em>
influenced annually by KAB and its almost 500 certified local
affiliate programs in 41 states. Millions more are influenced
indirectly by KAB national communications and programs. In the
early 1970's, KAB played a pivotal national role in raising
public awareness on the environment with its still
widely-recognized &quot;crying Indian&quot; public service
advertising campaign. However, KAB's most critical role through
the years has been that of encouraging Americans to get directly
involved voluntarily in a variety of environmental and community
improvement efforts. Over 2.6 million community volunteers took
part directly in KAB affiliate programs in 1995. </p>
<p>KAB advocates community-action on the environment, not
finger-pointing or blame- placing. The sum total of the
organization's effort is dedicated to facilitating partnerships
locally and nationwide that lead to accountable action on litter
and garbage at the community level. The KAB SYSTEM is the only
non-confrontational, community-wide social-change mechanism made
available to American communities and coordinated by a national
non profit organization. Each KAB community affiliate is locally
organized and operated. In 1995, two-thirds of the affiliates
were directly involved in solid waste planning in their
communities. Over 95% of affiliates are primary sources of
recycling education in their communities. </p>
<p>To retain affiliation with KAB, local affiliates must annually
certify the accountability of their activities in terms of
measurable progress made against a series of established
environmental and organizational objectives. The annual
certification of local affiliates ensures that the community uses
all elements of the KAB designed process that has been proven to
forge the kind of community-wide attitude and behavioral changes
and ongoing involvement of the citizenry that is the root of
environmental and social progress. These methods are building
blocks that give communities the kind of success experiences in
collaborative social endeavor that enables them to move on as
communities to tackling broader, more complex social and
environmental challenges. </p>
<p>On an everyday basis, KAB SYSTEM activities promote <em>quality
of life</em> along with environmental quality. In addition to
average litter reductions of 50 percent in their communities as a
result of KAB programs, many affiliates now also report crime
reductions in participating areas, increased community pride and
participation, and a significantly improved climate for economic
development. This progress is highly cost effective for the
communities involved as well. For every one dollar in public
money budgeted to KAB affiliate programs in 1995, an average of
$9.89 was returned to public treasuries in the form of
cost-avoidance, reduced clean up expenses, volunteer efforts
gained and goods and services donated by the private sector.<br>

<h3>A Few Current KAB National Initiatives</h3>
<dl>
    <dt><a href="bab.html"><strong>Build America Beautiful</strong></a><br>
    </dt>
    <dd>A national partnership with the National Association of
        Home Builders (NAHB) aimed at improving the performance
        of home builders, developers and contractors on litter
        prevention, site maintenance and solid waste issues such
        as source reduction, recycling (lumber, steel and other
        construction materials in addition to consumer materials)
        and in contractor/vendor education. Construction areas
        can be certified as BAB sites using a process designed
        jointly by KAB and NAHB and can enter a national
        Beautiful Builder awards program.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dt><a href="glad.html"><strong>GLAD Bag-a-Thon</strong></a><br>
    </dt>
    <dd>KAB and First Brands have teamed up to create the
        nation's biggest single clean-up event, the GLAD
        Bag-a-Thon. Millions of <em>tons</em> were collected by
        individual volunteers across the nation in the Bag-A-Thon
        last year. Bag-a-Thon is now in its tenth year.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dt><a href="loop.html"><strong>Close The Loop. Buy Recycled.</strong></a><br>
    </dt>
    <dd>A national partnership with the U.S. Environmental
        Protection Agency (EPA) aimed on educating consumers of
        the environmental contribution, price parity and
        performance parity of recycled, recyclable and
        recycled-content products.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dt><a href="nicad.html"><strong>Rechargeable Battery
        Recycling Program</strong></a><br>
    </dt>
    <dd>&quot;Charge Up To Recycle&quot; is a national
        partnership with the Rechargeable Battery Recycling
        Corporation (a coalition of battery manufacturers) aimed
        at national recycling of NiCd batteries (and eventually
        NiMh and others) through retail locations, community
        collection drives and commercial collection programs.
        Richard Karn (AL on ABC's <em>Home Improvement</em>) is
        national spokesman for the effort which launches this
        year.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dt><strong>Graffiti Hurts</strong><br>
    </dt>
    <dd>A national partnership with Sherwin-Williams and its
        Krylon brand to educate American communities about the
        poisonous effect graffiti can have on communities and
        about the ways communities can stop graffiti without
        confrontation. Several cities are now pioneering programs
        to empower neighborhoods to end graffiti vandalism for
        good. </dd>
</dl>
<p><em><strong>Also:</strong></em> Among hundreds of KAB programs
across the nation, others include a national major appliance
recycling program, a national box and container collection
program, education initiatives on a range of issues,
international initiatives to bring KAB-type approaches to
communities in need outside of the U.S. and many other product
recycling and collection initiatives. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
The bottom line? Through the national efforts of Keep America
Beautiful, Inc. and the KAB SYSTEM, citizens across America are
being energized to take an active role in caring for their
community and the environment. In doing so, they are gaining the
confidence to address other pressing environmental and social
challenges with similar success. Our programs influence millions
of Americans to put the environment on the top of their personal
and family agendas&#151;and gives them substantive ways to go out
and <em>actually do something about improving their community
environment</em> instead of pointing fingers or shouting about
it. </p>
<p>With the KAB SYSTEM, attitudes <em>are</em> changing.
Solutions to complex issues are being found. While litter
prevention and integrated solid waste management may not be given
headline status, their solutions provide the basic first steps
for enhancing the quality of life in America's communities. </p>

<h3>Where are the citizens and officials who will make tomorrow's
decisions about solid waste? They're in your classroom today.</h3>
<p>It's crucial that these future leaders understand waste issues
and how waste can be managed. There will always be garbage that
must be dealt with safely, even after recycling, composting, and
source reduction have done their part. <br>
</p>
<p>KAB's educational resources for teachers and students provide
a balanced perspective of waste and the options for its
management in clear and user-friendly formats.<br>

K-6 and <em>Waste: A Hidden Resource</em> for grades 7-12, build
critical thinking, processing, and problem solving skills through
imaginative, hands-on lessons. Lessons can be taught individually
or in sequence.<br>
</p>
<p>Developed and field-tested by professional educators and waste
experts, the curricula are being used nationwide by thousands of
teachers to influence positive behavior, foster social
responsibility and respect for the environment, and enrich the
learning experience.</p>

Build America Beautiful is an entirely voluntary program
developed in partnership between the National Association of Home
Builders (NAHB) and Keep America Beautiful, Inc. The program is
sponsored nationally by Amoco Chemicals, The Home Depot and Home
&amp; Garden TV Network. Build America Beautiful is all about
doing some simple things that will help you as well as your
employees and subcontractors become more aware about the litter
created around job sites and take better care to see that the
waste we do create gets handled properly.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>More Than Just A Pretty Site</h3>
<p>Builders who have taken part in Build America Beautiful report
that keeping a close eye on waste and litter around their sites
actually made the sites safer and reduced potential liability. It
increased the marketability of their work during and after
construction and boosted employee morale on-site. Even better, it
cemented their ongoing relationships with the community.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>It's Easy!</h3>
<p>It's easy to participate. Just follow the easy-to-use <a
href="babguide.html">guidelines</a> laid out in detail for you in
the Build America Beautiful Membership Kit. Along with the
guidelines, you'll be gaining a wealth of ready-to-use tools for
building America beautiful including ad-slicks of the Build
America Beautiful logo which you can use in your own advertising,
a sample press release for announcing your involvement, site
decals, hard hat stickers and the Construction Site Recycling
Handbook. </p>
<p>By taking part in Build America Beautiful, you'll also make
yourself eligible for an annual national awards program
recognizing America's most beautiful builders. <a
href="bab-awd.html">Entry forms</a> are available from NAHB and
Keep America Beautiful, Inc.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>What Are You Waiting For?</h3>
<p>Join the team that's building with pride and keeping America
beautiful. Call NAHB toll-free at 1-800-223-2665 to have your
Build America Beautiful membership kit shipped out today. You'll

<p>The GLAD Bag-A-Thon&#174; program, a partnership between Keep
America Beautiful, Inc. (KAB) and First Brands Corporation, is
the largest organized cleanup and recycling effort in the nation.
Since 1986, when the Bag-A-Thon&#174; program was piloted in five
KAB Affiliate communities, the program has continued to grow
successfully. Since 1990, the program has included more than 100
cities/communities nationwide. </p>
<p>The program promotes proper waste handling practices by
encouraging Americans to help clean up and restore neglected
public lands into usable space, recycle materials to preserve the
nation's resources and reuse clothing to help the needy and
divert it from landfills. </p>
<p>Bag-A-Thon&#174; volunteers learn their responsibility for
proper waste handling by cleaning up littered parks, beaches,
streets and neighborhoods and going a step further by restoring
neglected parks, illegal dumpsites and littered thoroughfares and
public facilities. In many cities, volunteers also participate in
organized multi-material recycling drives and/or clothing drives. </p>
<p>GLAD Wrap and Bags supports the program with the donation of
Handle-Tie Trash and Recycling Bags as well as educational
brochures about proper waste handling practices and provides
ongoing assistance to its Bag-A-Thon&#174; partner communities in
organizing the programs and obtaining widespread awareness for
local efforts. </p>

program, call 1-800-262-GLAD, or <a

width="398" height="182">In a two-year partnership between Keep
America Beautiful, Inc. (KAB) and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), a number of KAB community affiliates
developed and field-tested strategies for increasing awareness of
buying recycled. From their programs, the &quot;Close the Loop.
Buy Recycled.&quot; Community Education Kit was developed.</p>
<p>The kit's proven strategies have been used by Keep America
Beautiful affiliates nationwide to increase purchases of recycled
goods by consumers and businesses. Here are just a few ideas
implemented by KAB affiliate pilot projects through use of the
kit:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>A coalition of 100 concerned business leaders and
        government officials was formed.</li>
    <li>A procurement policy was adopted to promote an effort to
        establish and implement city-wide buy-recycled practices.</li>
    <li>A half-day seminar was conducted titled, &quot;How
        Recycling Can Effect Your Bottom Line.&quot;</li>
    <li>Treasure hunts were conducted at a local mall to identify
        products made with recycled materials.</li>
    <li>Awards programs were established to recognize businesses
        and institutions which practiced buying recycled or
        helped educate the public about &quot;closing the
        loop.&quot; </li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<br>
The &quot;Close the Loop. Buy Recycled.&quot; Community Education
Kit tools include:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Manual with step-by-step guide to awareness campaigns </p>
    <p>Camera-ready brochure for recycling centers or events </p>
    <p>Print and radio public service announcements </p>
    <p>Educational video featuring EPA Administrator Carol
    Browner </p>

<p><em><strong>A Program of The Rechargeable Battery Recycling
Corporation Endorsed by Keep America Beautiful, Inc.</strong></em></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h3>About the Program</h3>
<p>The Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation (RBRC) is a
national, nonprofit, public service organization designed to
administer the collection and recycling of rechargeable
Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd, or &quot;nikad&quot;) batteries. Recently,
RBRC launched the <em>Charge Up to Recycle! </em>campaign, which
is a nationwide education and mobilization program aimed at
establishing battery recycling strategies in three separate
areas:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The <em>Retail Recycling Plan</em> provides electronic
    retail stores, such as Radio Shack&#153; and Circuit
    City&#153;, with collection boxes that will enable the stores
    to serve as collection points for used NiCd batteries. The
    boxes themselves are preaddressed, and have prepaid shipping
    labels, so the retailer can easily ship the collected
    batteries for recycling.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>The Community Recycling Plan assists counties and
    municipalities to establish household NiCd battery collection
    programs. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>Under the Business &amp; Public Agency Recycling Plan
    businesses and government agencies receive information on how
    to set up and operate a battery collection program in their
    offices, and are offered a blanket rate for shipping the used
    NiCds to the recycler. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Who Covers the Recycling Costs? </h3>
<p>The Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation (RBRC) pays to
have the batteries recycled by the International Metals
Reclamation Company, located in Pennsylvania. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>How are the Batteries Recycled? </h3>
<p>At the recycling facility, a thermal process is used to
reclaim the cadmium, nickel and iron content of the batteries.
The recycled cadmium is used to make new batteries while the
nickel and iron are used to make stainless steel. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>How is the Program Funded? </h3>
<p>RBRC has established the <em>RBRC Seal </em>as a standard for
battery labeling. License fees paid by rechargeable battery and
battery-powered product manufacturers, which permit them to place
the RBRC Seal on their products, fund the program. Currently,
over 200 companies have entered the license agreement. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Which States are Participating? </h3>
<p>The U.S. Congress recently passed a bill which states that
NiCd rechargeable batteries are exempt from hazardous waste
regulations even if commercially generated because viable means
now exist for these batteries to be recycled. As a result, RBRC
is launching its <em>Charge Up To Recycle!</em> campaign in all
50 states. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Are Other Batteries Accepted? </h3>
<p>The <em>Charge Up to Recycle!</em> program only handles NiCd
batteries at this point (and NOT Nickel Metal-Hydride [NiMh] or
any other kinds of rechargeable batteries). Mixed shipments will
be returned. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>How Do I Find Out Who is Participating in My Community? </h3>
<p>An 800 line has been established by RBRC to direct individuals
to the collection center nearest them. It is 1-800-8-BATTERY. </p>

<h2>Why and How to Become a KAB Certified Affiliate Community</h2>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>The KAB System</h3>
<p>In nearly 500 cities, towns, and counties in America, litter
has been reduced, solid waste is being managed more effectively,
and people respect and care for the local environment. What makes
these communities unique? Keep America Beautiful, Inc. and the
KAB System.</p>
<p>The KAB System is a behavior-based approach to prevent
littering and improve waste handling practices at the grassroots
level through education, community-wide involvement, and
public-private partnerships. It is offered to communities on a
certification basis.</p>
<p>Becoming a KAB affiliate requires a commitment from citizens,
businesses, elected and public officials, and civic leaders to
work together in identifying local concerns and applying the
System's five-step approach: getting the facts, involving the
people, planning systematically, focusing on results, and
providing positive reinforcement.</p>
<p>The KAB System improves communities because it addresses the
foundations that cause waste to be mishandled and provides
long-term solutions, rather than focus on one-time cleanup
events.</p>
<p>Proven effective in communities of every size, the KAB System
can work in your community, too.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Instilling Positive Attitudes&#151;</strong>The
    KAB System responds to the underlying norms people have that
    result in littered conditions: the belief that someone else
    will clean up after them; no sense of ownership; and that it
    is acceptable to litter where it has already accumulated.
    Using KAB's five-step attitude-change process, affiliate
    communities foster positive attitudes and reinforce the
    concept of citizen ownership of roads, parks, and other
    public lands. These steps are also used by KAB affiliates to
    address local solid waste management concerns.</p>
    <p><strong>Community Ownership&#151;</strong>The structure of
    a KAB affiliate ensures broad-based involvement of all
    sectors of the community and empowers a volunteer board of
    directors and subcommittees to mobilize citizens to action. </p>
    <p><strong>Standards of Performance&#151;</strong>Each KAB
    affiliate conducts two annual measurements to document
    improved waste handling in the community and the return on
    public monies invested in the program. A photographic survey
    objectively examines trends in litter accumulation in the
    community and uses a formula to calculate reductions in
    litter from year to year. A cost/benefit analysis measures
    the dollar value returned to the community in the form of
    cost-avoidance, reduced cleanup costs, volunteer hours, and
    donated goods and services for each $1 of municipal monies
    provided. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>National Initiatives</h3>
<p>Exciting program dimensions are developed by KAB in
partnership with corporate members and members of its National
Advisory Council. They include:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><a href="loop.html"><strong>&quot;Close the Loop. Buy
    Recycled.&quot;</strong></a><strong>&#151; </strong>Keep
    America Beautiful affiliates are educating consumers and
    businesses about &quot;buying recycled&quot; with a turn-key
    kit created by KAB and the U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency. Fifteen affiliates helped develop and field-test the
    kit.</p>
    <p><a href="glad.html"><strong>GLAD Bag-A-Thon</strong></a><strong>&#151;</strong>Over
    75 affiliates participate in this ongoing cleanup and
    recycling program, the largest of its kind in the U.S.
    Year-round educational actions culminate each spring in a
    GLAD Bag-A-Thon cleanup/recycling day or week in the
    affiliate's community. </p>
    <p><a href="bab.html"><strong>Build America Beautiful</strong></a><strong>&#151;</strong>All
    KAB affiliates can help home builders reduce job-site litter
    and waste with guidelines from KAB and the National
    Association of Home Builders. </p>

    is being promoted by KAB and affiliates in cooperation with
    the Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation, to recover
    batteries from home electronics and tools. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Network Services</h3>
<p>Network services are provided to KAB affiliates so that they
serve their communities more effectively and maintain a
leadership role in litter and solid waste concerns.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Field Counseling and Guidance&#151;</strong>Quarterly
    contacts with each affiliate are made by KAB staff and/or a
    National Representative. Calls offer support and guidance on
    all aspects of the KAB System and its use. Site visits by a
    National Representative may also be scheduled to provide
    training and counseling for an affiliate's coordinator and
    board of directors.</p>
    <p><strong>Workshops and Seminars&#151;</strong>Workshops may
    be held regionally, or for individual affiliates by a KAB
    National Representative. They include training in the use of
    KAB curricula, new coordinator training, risk communication,
    and the special Building Better Board Relationships&quot;
    seminar for an affiliate's board of directors. Take-away
    materials supplement each workshop. </p>
    <p><strong>Regional and Annual Meetings&#151;</strong>Regional
    and annual meetings are held by KAB to reach affiliate
    coordinators, their staffs, key board members, and the public
    and private sectors. Agendas for regional meetings include
    training sessions, professional skills development, case
    studies, and workshops on solid waste and litter issues.
    National trends and issues, as well as KAB's National Awards
    ceremony, highlight the annual meeting. </p>
    <p><strong>Media Relations&#151;</strong>KAB's Communications
    Department helps strengthen an affiliate's local media
    relations through public service advertising and other
    strategies. </p>
    <p><strong>Informational Mailings&#151;</strong>KAB, in
    cooperation with member companies or members of its National
    Advisory Council, provides publications, videos, and other
    educational material. </p>
    <p><a href="awards.html"><strong>National Awards Program</strong></a><strong>&#151;</strong>Each
    year, over 80 prestigious awards are given by KAB to
    recognize outstanding KAB affiliates, civic and youth groups,
    individuals, and companies. </p>
    <p><strong>Monthly issues of </strong><em><strong>Network</strong></em><strong>&#151;</strong><em>Network</em>,
    for KAB affiliates, highlights program and project ideas from
    affiliates, educational resources, and national initiatives
    from KAB. </p>
    <p><strong>Special Projects Division&#151;</strong>Affiliates
    can order promotional items such as car litterbags, book
    jackets, and activity books for children. Many items can be
    printed with the affiliate's name or that of a local sponsor. </p>
    <p><strong>Coordinators Advisory Council&#151;</strong>Local
    KAB affiliate coordinators and one state leader serve on the
    council. The council relays feedback from local affiliates to
    KAB staff and committees, and provides an additional source
    of information from KAB to its affiliates. </p>
    <p>To support the involvement of its affiliates in solid
    waste education and solid waste management, KAB and its Solid
    Waste Committee of public and private-sector members develop
    resources for local use. These include:</p>
    <p><a href="study.html"><strong>&quot;The Role of Recycling
    In Integrated Solid Waste Management to the Year 2000&quot;</strong></a><strong>&#151;</strong>KAB's
    national study of recycling and solid waste provides solid
    waste officials with data and forecasts to assist in planning
    the most effective local management possible.</p>
    <p><strong>Waste in the Workplace&#151;</strong>Provides the
    commercial sector with guidelines for auditing waste,
    identifying recyclables, minimizing waste, and reducing
    disposal costs.</p>
    <p><strong>Household Appliance Recovery Kit&#151;</strong>Enables
    coordinators to educate the community about the importance of
    appliance recovery, the steps involved, and related Clean Air
    Act issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Teacher Curricula</h3>

A Hidden Resource</em></a> for grades 7-12&#151;help tomorrow's
decision-makers understand the integrated approach to managing
solid waste and preventing litter. Teacher training institutes
are organized by affiliates and led by a KAB National Education
Consultant. To supplement classroom activities, KAB also offers
resources such as the &quot;200 Million Tons of Trash&quot;
poster, which provides hands-on activities, and fact sheets. An
Education Committee of professional educators from the public and
private sectors guide the development of these teacher resources
and other KAB education initiatives.</p>

<h3>Facts on Municipal Solid Waste</h3>
<p>In 1994, Americans generated 209 million tons of municipal
solid waste (MSW). Municipal solid waste is defined as waste from
residential, commercial, institutional, and some industrial
sources. It does not include a wide variety of nonhazardous
wastes that usually are landfilled with MSW such as construction
and demolition wastes and automobile bodies. </p>
<p>MSW generation rates are simply estimates, since population
and economics are ever-changing. Nonetheless, natural population
growth and sustained long-term growth in the economy will likely
increase MSW generation; 223 million tons is estimated for the
year 2000. </p>
<p>While tonnage continues to increase, the percentage of MSW
actually disposed of in landfills will decrease due to recycling
and composting efforts. But estimates project a gradually
increasing recycling rate 30% by the year 2000, therefore it is
necessary for communities to consider other waste management
methods that will complement recycling. </p>
<p><br>

<h3>Composition of Waste Stream</h3>

</p>
<h4>Managing Municipal Solid Waste</h4>
<p>As the quantity of MSW grows, concern for its safe and
efficient management grows too. Effective waste management
requires what is known as an integrated approach&#151;the
consideration of a number of waste management methods that work
compatibly. These waste management methods include source
reduction, recycling, composting, waste-to-energy, and sanitary
landfill. Together, these methods effectively manage our nation's
waste while, at the same time, protect human health and the
environment. </p>
<p>These waste management alternatives can effectively manage
waste when they are used interdependently, not independently.
Utilizing an integrated waste management approach does not mean
that all of these methods must be implemented, rather it presents
a menu which every community may consider to best fit their
needs. Since each community varies in population, geology,
composition of the waste stream, availability of recycling
markets, etc., waste management methods will also vary.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h4>Source Reduction</h4>
<p>One way to decrease the amount of waste that needs to be
managed is to not generate it in the first place.
&quot;Preventing waste&quot; is known as source reduction. The
EPA defines source reduction as reducing the quantity of material
that must be discarded, minimizing toxic substances in products,
and manufacturing products with longer, more useful lives.
Manufacturers and consumers alike may take on the responsibility
of preventing waste. For instance, many manufacturers are
eliminating excess packaging from their products. And, many
consumers are reducing waste through such actions as writing on
both sides of a sheet of paper and donating old clothes and
furniture to charity.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h4>Recycling</h4>
<p>The most commonly collected recyclable materials from homes
and businesses include paper, aluminum, steel, glass, paper, and
plastic. In order for these, and other materials, to be recycled,
we need to complete, or close, the recycling loop. The recycling
loop involves collecting recyclables, separating them, preparing
the recyclable material to buyer's specifications, processing the
material into new products, placing the product back in the
market place, and, consumers purchasing the new product that now
contains recycled material. All of these steps must be completed
before the recycling loop is &quot;closed.&quot; Viable and
stable markets are vital to recycling's success. That is, if
consumers don't buy products made with recycled material,
manufacturers won't have the incentive to buy and process
recyclables into new products. </p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h4>Composting</h4>
<p>The break down of organic materials, such as grass, leaves and
brush, and into a soil-like amendment that may be used for
agricultural and horticultural purposes is known as composting.
This method of managing solid waste is an effective alternative
for states and communities responding to landfill bans on yard
wastes. &quot;Backyard composting&quot; is becoming a household
phrase as more and more homeowners compost organic wastes in
their own backyards.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h4>Waste-to-Energy</h4>
<p>MSW brought to a waste-to-energy facility is either burned as
received (mass burning) or may be processed to remove
noncombustible materials to produce a more uniform fuel
(refuse-derived fuel). These facilities can reduce the quantity
of MSW by up to 90% while generating steam or electricity.
Emission controls eliminate 99% of air pollutants; and the ash
disposed of in a double lined landfill, does not pose a threat to
groundwater.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h4>Sanitary Landfill</h4>
<p>Modern sanitary landfills are state-of-the-art facilities that
manage approximately 61% of our municipal solid waste. Today's
landfills are equipped with monitoring, control, and collection
systems that treat the by-products of waste decomposition. Thus
protecting our air, land, and water . Many landfills have closed
in recent years after reaching capacity. Others closed because
they failed to meet today's stringent environmental regulations,
making open &quot;dumps&quot; a thing of the past. Despite the
number of landfill closings, there is no nationwide problem with
disposal capacity. New landfills are being constructed and
existing landfills are expanding their capacity. Sanitary
landfills will always be needed to dispose of nonrecyclable
items, ash from waste-to-energy plants, and residue from
processing recyclable materials.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Municipal solid waste (MSW) is a term used to represent all
the garbage created by households, commercial sites (like
restaurants, stores, offices etc.) and institutions (like
schools, museums, public parks etc.). MSW also includes things
like packaging and office paper waste from small to mid-sized
factories which are known as &quot;light industrial sites.&quot;
The ebb and flow of the various elements or materials that make
up the totality of MSW is referred to as the municipal solid
waste stream.</p>
<p>As our population has grown&#151;along with the variety and
amount of commercial products that we use&#151;so has the total
amount of MSW that Americans generate in the course of a year. In
fact, MSW volume has increased upwards of 250 percent since
1960&#151;from 88 million tons to over 209 million tons in 1994. </p>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) now projects
continuing increases in annual MSW generation at a rate of 1.2%
annually through the year 2000 and beyond. That translates to a
total of 223 million tons of MSW communities will be dealing with
in 2000 and, if EPA's estimates hold, 262 million tons in 2010. </p>

alt="Graph, MSW 1980 - 2000" align="bottom" width="400"
height="250"></p>
<p>The charts on this page illustrate a continuing evolution in
the variety of ways MSW is managed in communities across the U.S. </p>
<hr>
<p><br>
</p>
<h2>Waste Management Basics </h2>
<p>The first thing to remember about MSW management is that what
may in fact be good for one community&#151;environmentally,
economically and in terms of the community's quality of
life&#151;may actually be different than what is good for
another. This determination depends on a range of independent
variables. That's why, to deal effectively with the millions of
tons of garbage we create, we have to entertain a variety of
different options for dealing with the waste. </p>
<p>No single MSW management option alone can manage all of our
nation's waste. For example, recent U.S. EPA research predicts
that recycling and composting&#151;now 24 percent of all MSW
management activity&#151;can possibly be increased to 30 percent
of MSW management activity by 2000, though this will in fact
still require some significant changes in social behavior and in
other key social and economic factors. However even if we
accomplish this, American communities will still face over 156
million tons of garbage that will have to be managed in other
ways. </p>
<p><img src="msw.gif" lowsrc="lmsw.gif"
alt="Pie Chart of MSW by Weight" align="right" hspace="0"
width="358" height="464"> That is why the EPA, as well as many
states and communities across the nation, now actively pursue
what is called an integrated waste management approach to MSW.
The integrated approach offers communities five different waste
management options to choose from depending on their own specific
needs and the prevailing economic and environmental conditions
they face. The primary options (described in detail in the
sections that follow) include source reduction, recycling,
composting, landfilling and waste-to-energy (combustion). </p>
<p>Most communities use several of these options to manage their
waste stream, and many use all of them to some extent. The
important thing in an integrated waste management approach is
that each element of a community's waste stream is handled in the
most effective, cost-efficient, safe and environmentally
beneficial manner realistically practicable in that community.
This way, increments of progress can be sustained in an overall
MSW management program that lasts for the long term. Each of the
integrated waste management options entails both benefits and
costs, which will make it more appropriate in some situations and
less appropriate in others.</p>
<p><br>
<br>

<p><br>
</p>
<h2>Source Reduction</h2>
<p>Although there is no universal definition for source
reduction, the EPA defines it as reducing at the source the
amount of material we produce as a society that eventually gets
discarded as garbage. </p>
<p>There is increasing demand today for products that are more
durable and can last longer than products of past generations.
Demand is also up for products that can be reused both for their
original function or different, alternative functions. And there
is solid demand across the board for products and packaging that
minimize or if at all possible eliminate the use of toxic
substances. As a result, &quot;stand-alone&quot; consumer
products with minimal or no packaging, concentrated or bulk
products, and refillable packages are all no longer frills but
indeed staples of the marketplace.</p>
<p>But source reduction is a two way street. In today's
competitive marketplace, businesses find that products designed
for source reduction can not only attract new consumers, but
often mean better profits in manufacturing and distribution.
Emerging technologies have produced new manufacturing materials
and packaging designs that use less material (so they cost less
to produce) and yet perform the same or even do a better job (so
they actually yield more profits when all is said and done.) </p>
<p><br>
<img src="over4.gif"
alt="Table: Reduction in Weights of Soft Drink Containers, 1972 - 1992"
align="left" hspace="5" width="409" height="258"> For example,
some newly developed packages that use a fraction of the material
required in the past are performing as well at preventing
needless spoilage or breakage of products during distribution and
retailing (which can be a hidden but surprisingly significant
source of MSW).</p>
<p>The progress that can be made through market driven source
reduction can be significant. Take soft drink containers. Over
the past several decades, manufacturers have realized weight
reductions of up to 30 percent or more in aluminum and steel cans
and in glass and plastic bottles. For example, in 1972,
one-hundred 12-fluid-ounce aluminum cans weighed 4.5 pounds.
Through improved technology and design, these same 100 cans
weighed only 3.51 pounds in 1992&#151;a 22% reduction. Steel
beverage cans, which have steel sides and aluminum ends, have
also been downsized and are now 40% lighter than they were in
1970. </p>
<p>Since 1977, the popular two-liter &quot;PET&quot; plastic soft
drink bottles have been reduced from 68 grams each to 51 grams, a
25 percent reduction in material used per bottle. When you
consider that more than seven billion of these two-liter PET
bottles are sold annually, the same volume of product is being
delivered to consumers every year, yet with some 250 million
pounds less packaging, almost all of which used to end up at one
time or another in the MSW stream.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p><br>
</p>
<h2>Recycling</h2>
<p>According to the EPA, American communities recycled or
composted 24 percent of MSW in 1994 (with composting accounting
for about 3 percent of that total). That means that almost 50
million tons of material was diverted to new generations of use.
The chart below further illustrates the breakdown of MSW, showing
the extent to which different materials are being recycled.</p>
<p><img src="over6.gif"
alt="Table:  Materials Generated and Recycled in 1994"
align="bottom" width="385" height="398"></p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>The Market Forces That Ultimately Drive Recycling</h3>
<p>Recycling involves a complex process through which materials
that can be effectively and efficiently reconverted to raw
material for new products are collected from businesses and
residences, then are sold to manufacturers for processing and
reuse in new generations of products.</p>
<p>The continued long term success of recycling as an MSW
management method depends on the maturation of the
business-to-business marketplace for recycled materials and the
consumer marketplace for recycled-content products. When the
recycling economy is working the way it should be, it is a closed
loop in which consumers, product manufacturers and waste haulers
all have a critical sustaining role to play. All elements are
interconnected&#151;none of the players in the process exists in
a vacuum. </p>
<p><img src="over7.gif" alt="Recycling Loop" align="right"
hspace="0" width="432" height="320">The most critical step is the
determination as to whether it is in fact in anyone's interest to
buy collected recyclables of any given material. If the collected
recyclables do have a value, the money that is paid for them
represents the incentive which makes it worthwhile for
communities to collect them in the first place. </p>
<p>But a manufacturer will only buy the collected recyclable
materials and invest in the infrastructure and resources it takes
to process them if their customers are demanding products that
include recycled raw materials, or if it is less expensive for
them to use recycled material as opposed to virgin raw material.
The cycle revolves in this manner continuously, evolving each day
as consumers, manufacturers and waste haulers react to each
others' actions and reactions.</p>
<p>But the extent to which the loop can be continually fed with
new or additional materials for recycling is not infinite.
Several factors come in to play that determine where exactly the
market for any given material as a recycled commodity
&quot;balances&quot; at any given moment. Some materials will
simply be more in demand as a recycled raw material from time to
time than others. That demand can be very cyclical, even
volatile, and is partly a function of economic and other
variables that have nothing to do with MSW or environmental
factors. Consumer demand is also highly cyclical. </p>
<p>There are other variables that characterize the recycling loop
that are more functional, and thus less cyclical, though no less
important to the mix. For example, in some communities, the cost
of transporting materials to the major manufacturers that would
be interested in buying the material simply might not make
economic or environmental sense. Consider the often encountered
scenario in which a community may have a ton of recycled material
to sell, but the only realistic, potential buyer of the recycled
material is thousands of miles away or perhaps even overseas. Or
another scenario in which products using a certain material in
general could be in such low demand at that moment that a
manufacturer cannot even consider any influx of new raw material,
recycled or virgin. </p>
<p>Intense competitive issues within industries also factor into
the equation. As they fulfill their role in the closed loop of
recycling, individual manufacturers have the ongoing competitive
challenge of determining whether or not a certain recycled
material measures up to virgin raw materials in terms of a
product's quality specifications (which are in part dictated by
the changing tastes of their customers), and their cost
structures (which are also a function of consumer and competitor
behavior.) </p>
<p>Even more technical factors can also contribute to the extent
to which a given manufacturer will use recyclables at any given
time. In some manufacturing processes, for example, even tiny
bits of the wrong material in a batch of recyclables makes the
whole batch useless. This is one reason why it is so important to
the success of recycling that we all carefully separate materials
as directed when the collector indicates separation is necessary. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Collection Options for Recycling</h3>
<p>There are three primary options of recyclables collection from
residential sources. Curbside collection involves a waste hauler
or recycler collecting recyclable materials, separated from other
garbage at the household itself. In this case, residents need
only to faithfully separate recyclables from their non-recyclable
garbage and ensure that the materials make it to the curb when
they are supposed to. According to BioCycle magazine, there are
over 7,000 curbside collection programs in the U.S. today serving
121 million Americans. </p>
<p>The two other most common collection options, drop-off centers
and buy-back centers are similar to each other in terms of how
recyclables are actually collected, but are subtly different in
terms of the incentives involved. Drop-off and buy-back centers
are convenient, centrally located facilities where residents can
deposit different recyclable materials into separate bins. They
are typically located in a public or commercial parking lot, a
transfer station or landfill. The major difference between the
two options is that at buy-back centers, residents and businesses
are actually paid for the recyclables they drop-off, most often
based on the total weight of the individual materials they
provide. Drop off centers are usually unattended (which affects
the quality and marketability of the products they collect) and
rely on consumer goodwill as an incentive.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that none of these collection
options comes free of charge, to someone in the process. Most
often that someone is the taxpayer or the consumer. That is why
it is in everyone's interest that a community's collection
program is both environmentally effective and economically
efficient. This fact also has a lot to do with why different
communities can have vastly different systems for collecting
recyclables.</p>
<p>In the commercial sector, the final responsibility for
delivering recyclables to a processing center or recyclables
buyer falls primarily on the shoulders of the individual company
or commercial site. Because commercial operations have a fairly
consistent waste stream, in many cases they can generate quality
recycled material. Also because they have more control over their
waste stream and they generate large quantities of certain
materials, recycling can actually be an important revenue source
for commercial operations. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Materials Being Recycled Today</h3>
<p>Given current technology, not all materials in the MSW stream
are readily recyclable. Nor do all materials have qualities that
currently make them a valuable commodity in the recycling
marketplace. As mentioned before, some commodities may be in high
demand in one area (for example if a processor or manufacturer
that needs that material is nearby) but can be in little or no
demand elsewhere. </p>
<p>That's why communities will often specify that their residents
and businesses recycle only certain materials&#151;which in fact
are the ones that are currently practical and economical
recycling commodities. That specification can change from time to
time as new recycling markets emerge and new technologies
develop. The materials that follow are those most commonly
collected from homes and businesses for recycling.</p>
<p><img src="over10.gif"
alt="Residential and Commercial Recycling" align="bottom"
width="497" height="370"></p>
<p>The breakdown of recycled materials above is indicative of the
fact that commercial sites are large contributors to the
collection of recycled materials. The most commonly recycled
material, corrugated cartons, are primary carriers of
distribution and storage in the commercial sector.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>PAPER</h4>
<p>Americans recovered for recycling 45% of all paper they used
in 1995&#151;up from 41% in 1994&#151;according to the American
Forest &amp; Paper Association (AF&amp;PA). There are many
different types of recyclable paper, called grades. Each has a
unique value that has a lot to do with what kinds of wood fibers
they will yield for papermakers when broken down. <img
src="over11.gif" alt="Table:  Paper Recovery" align="right"
hspace="0" vspace="5" width="308" height="178"></p>
<p>Generally, paper grades can be grouped into four categories: </p>
<p><em><strong>Corrugated Paper</strong></em> includes old
corrugated boxes, kraft (brown) grocery bags, and shipping sacks.
(Corrugated paper represents 55% of all paper recovered.) </p>
<p><em><strong>Newspapers</strong></em> are manufactured in a
unique papermaking process so old newspapers that have been
separated from other grades of paper and collected from homes and
businesses have a distinct value. On the other hand, newspaper
mixed in with other forms of paper can have much less, or even no
value as a recyclable. </p>
<p><em><strong>High Grade Papers</strong></em> refer to
&quot;white&quot; or bleached office papers used in copying
machine and printing applications and other high quality papers
collected from printing plants. High grade papers represent the
most eagerly sought after form of recycled paper, and can be used
to produce the highest quality recycled paper products.</p>
<p><em><strong>Mixed Papers</strong></em> are groups of different
grades and colors of paper which are used in the manufacture of
various products, such as lower-quality printing and writing
papers, tissue, and recycled paperboard.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>ALUMINUM</h4>
<p>Aluminum has a long history of recycling mainly because
recycled aluminum as a raw material can provide significant
energy savings compared to use of virgin aluminum raw materials
(mainly the ore bauxite).</p>
<p><img src="over12a.gif" alt="Aluminum Can Reclamation"
align="right" hspace="5" width="300" height="212">Today, nearly
100 billion aluminum beverage cans are manufactured each year in
the U.S. alone. Approximately 64 percent of these cans are
recycled. In fact, the recycling infrastructure for aluminum cans
is so efficient now that it can take as few as 90 days for an
aluminum can to be collected, melted down, and made into a new
can ready for distribution. Every aluminum beverage can now on
the market has an average of 54 percent recycled aluminum.</p>
<p>Other aluminum products that can be readily recycled include
foil wrap, food cans, pie plates, frozen food trays, lawn chair
tubing, storm door and window frames, residential siding, and
auto parts. Altogether, aluminum from recycled cans and other
products accounts for about 32 percent of the industry's metals
supply.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>STEEL</h4>
<p>Most steel products can be recycled into new products many
different times. Today, for example, steel-based packaging
products produced in the U.S. have at least 25 percent recycled
steel. (Structural steel, used in erecting bridges, buildings and
the like, is less likely to use large amounts of recycled steel,
given current technology, due to engineering and quality-control
considerations.) </p>
<p><img src="over12s.gif" lowsrc="lover12s.gif"
alt="Steel Can Recycling Rates" align="right" hspace="5"
width="305" height="331"> A variety of consumer products, ranging
from food to paints and cleaning products, are packaged in steel
cans. And according to the Steel Recycling Institute, 55.9
percent of all steel cans were recycled in 1995, representing
significant growth in recycling compared to just 1989 when only
18% of steel cans were being recovered by consumers for
recycling.</p>
<p>While food and beverage cans were originally the major steel
material collected from households, many communities are now
actively recycling other steel-made items such as empty aerosol
and paint cans in their collection programs. (In some
communities, even the remaining paint in the cans is being
collected for recycling.)</p>
<p>In all, more than 170 million Americans have access to
programs that recycle steel through curbside, drop-off, and
buy-back programs. In addition, each year, millions of tons of
steel scrap from appliances, automobiles, and other products are
also recovered and recycled. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>PLASTICS</h4>
<p>In 1994, the recovery rate for all plastics reached nearly 20
percent. According to a study by R.W. Beck, roughly half the U.S.
population has access to some form of plastics collection,
including drop-off collection centers and curbside plastics
collection. That represents a dramatic increase from just a few
years ago. </p>
<p>As far as plastics recycling goes, the most important thing to
remember is that there are many different types of plastics and
each one is unique. Two of the most widely used forms of plastic,
one called &quot;PET&quot; (which stands for polyethylene
terpephthalate) and another referred to as &quot;HDPE&quot; (high
density polyethylene), are now widely recycled, and growth
continues in most other varieties of plastic. </p>
<p>Soft-drink bottles and other rigid containers are among the
most common uses of PET. Approximately 547 million pounds of PET
were recovered for recycling in 1994, up from 447 million pounds
in 1993, making the PET soft-drink bottle the most commonly
recycled plastic container. 48.6 percent of these containers were
recycled in 1994. There are many uses for recycled PET, including
the manufacture of carpet face yarns and fiberfill for products
like sleeping bags and ski jackets. Recently, new recycling and
container fabrication technologies have enabled manufacturers to
use recycled PET in other food packaging applications. </p>
<p>Milk bottles, pigmented (colored) bottles, and soft-drink
&quot;base cups&quot; are all made from HDPE. As with PET, more
HDPE was recovered for recycling in 1994 (537 million pounds)
than in 1993 (444 million pounds). A variety of secondary uses
are being created for recycled HDPE, including new base cups for
PET soft-drink containers, trash cans, detergent and oil bottles,
flower pots, and traffic cones. And, like PET, recycled HDPE is
now appearing in food packaging. Polystyrene (PS) is used in
electronic components, office supplies, housewares, and food
service packaging. In 1994, 34.7 million pounds of polystyrene
were recycled, up from 1.9 million pounds in 1993.</p>
<p>It is important to remember, Polystyrene, HDPE, PET and other
varieties of plastic all have very different properties which
means that they must be separated by consumers and collectors if
they are to become a raw material for new products. One
difficulty that has arisen in the past has been that the
differences between varieties of plastic are not always readily
apparent when comparing the containers visually. </p>
<p>That is why The Society of the Plastics Industry developed a
uniform coding system (shown below) that identifies the type of
resin (the base material from which the plastic is made) which is
used in rigid plastic packaging (like bottles, packages etc.).
This coding system should actually facilitate more and better
quality recycling of plastics when it is economically and
environmentally sensible to do so. The &quot;plastic codes&quot;
now appear on most forms of rigid plastic packaging. Again, it is
critical to the success of plastics recycling that different
plastic items are separated by the household or collector
according to their proper code.</p>

<h4>GLASS</h4>
<p>According to the Glass Packaging Institute (GPI), the glass
container industry recorded a 37 percent recycling rate in 1994.</p>
<p>Recycled glass is made up of cullet, or crushed glass, that is
used in the production of new glass containers. Since 1988, the
amount of cullet used in the manufacture of new containers has
risen substantially. That's because cullet can offer
manufacturers several competitive advantages over virgin
materials. Foremost of these is the fact that cullet melts at
lower temperatures than virgin glassmaking raw materials, and
that allows manufacturers to reduce their energy usage (and
costs) and reduce their air emissions (as well as associated
pollution-prevention costs). </p>
<p>The quality of glass cullet is extremely important to its
recyclability. Glass comes in three colors: flint (which is a
greenish color), clear, and amber (which is brownish). Glass that
is color-sorted and meets specifications is very marketable as a
recycled commodity. Because of the manufacturing processes now
used, cullet that is not color-sorted has little to no value to
container manufacturers. In the years ahead, sophisticated fiber
optics may aid manufacturers in mechanically color-sorting glass,
according to the Glass Packaging Institute. But now the burden
rests primarily on consumers and collectors.</p>
<p><img src="over15.gif" alt="Glass Recycling Rate" align="right"
hspace="0" width="494" height="299"> Contamination is also a
major concern in glass recycling. Processing equipment is
designed to remove contaminants from the glass such as metals,
which are removed magnetically, as well as other items like
aluminum caps and labels that can be removed using other methods.
Still other potential contaminants, such as food residue, remain
with cullet after initial processing but are safely burned off
during the melting process. </p>
<p>However, ceramic materials (such as clay coffee-mugs, plates,
dishes et al.) are the glass industry's number one contamination
problem in the recycling process. What makes these materials
especially troublesome is that, in addition to the fact that they
can ruin a batch of cullet, they are also not easily removed at
any step during processing. That is why it is critical that
ceramics, as well as other types of glass (window glass, baking
glass, and headlight lenses) are removed at or before the point
of collection by consumers or collectors. </p>

<h4>SCRAP TIRES</h4>
<p><img src="over16.gif" alt="Tire Recovery" align="left"
hspace="0" width="287" height="323"> <br>
According to the Scrap Tire Management Council (STMC), 250
million tires become &quot;scrap&quot; or MSW annually&#151;which
is about one tire for every American. </p>
<p>The EPA has reported that two to three billion scrap auto and
truck tires have been either stockpiled or illegally dumped.
There is now a growing market demand for recovered scrap tires.
In 1995, 69 percent of all scrap tires generated were recovered
for recycling and other re-uses, a 26 percent increase from 1994. </p>
<p>Many of the recovered tires are shredded to generate
tire-derived fuel (TDF), which can be used by electric utilities,
pulp and paper mills, and cement kilns. Recent reports have shown
that TDF is comparable to fossil fuel and, in many cases, burns
cleaner and cheaper than coal.</p>

<h2>Composting</h2>
<p>Composting involves the aerobic, biological decomposition of
organic waste materials (meaning that living microbes combine
with oxygen to cause the decomposition). The end result of
composting is a nutrient-rich, soil-additive called
&quot;compost.&quot; For many years, compostable materials have
contributed millions of tons of material to landfills. Yard
wastes&#151;such as leaves, grass clippings, prunings, and other
natural organic wastes&#151;are in fact the second-largest
component in the MSW stream (comprising 15 percent), behind
paper.</p>
<p>Composting's natural ability to recycle organic materials like
yard waste enables communities to divert a significant portion of
what was once MSW from landfills and into potentially productive
reuses. According to the EPA, composting diverted 3 percent of
MSW from landfills in 1994. Indeed, today, almost half of all
U.S. states now actually ban yard waste from landfills because of
this large volume as well as its potential for being composted.
Markets are now slowly maturing for the finished product&#151;the
compost&#151;which means future incentives could possibly
increase collection and processing of compostable materials down
the road. Compost is already widely used in agriculture and
horticulture (gardening), golf course construction and in
creating landfill cover (the layer of soil that is placed over
old landfills after they have reached capacity.)</p>
<p>Researchers in industry and in government are now studying
composting as a recycling method for some paper wastes that
cannot be effectively recycled into new paper products for one
reason or another. These applications could include composting of
paper products that have been in contact with messy foods at
restaurants or grocery stores, or scraps of papers that are too
small to effectively use as fiber for new papers. Research is
also being conducted into the potential for composting food waste
from commercial sources. Today, there are an estimated
2,000&#151;2,300 municipal yard waste composting sites. There are
also innumerable &quot;backyard&quot; composting programs, whose
popularity is increasing among homeowners. </p>

<h2>Waste-To-Energy (Combustion)</h2>
<p>Waste-to-energy generation (WTE), the process through which
wastes are collected and combusted to create steam or
electricity, is an effective method of solid waste management and
landfill volume reduction that many communities now rely on.</p>
<p><img src="w-t-e.gif" alt="Waste-to-Energy Plant Diagram"
align="bottom" width="497" height="340"></p>
<p>While the science of the environmental impact of WTE, the
technology of materials extraction and the intricacies of the
economics associated with WTE processes are complex, the
essential process of WTE is not complicated. Quite simply,
instead of being trucked to a landfill, solid waste is brought to
a waste-to-energy plant and is burned at high heats in a process
that creates steam or electricity that is, in turn, sold to
electric generating utilities who distribute it to local homes
and businesses. WTE does not eliminate all the MSW volume of the
solid waste it receives. In fact, about 10 percent of the
original volume is left over after combustion in the WTE furnace
(most often called the boiler) as ash that itself must be either
recycled or landfilled. The recyclable metals that are left over
after incineration are collected and sent to processors for
recycling. </p>
<p>Recycling in fact improves the efficiency of WTE plants by
encouraging the removal of non-combustibles such as glass and
metal, allowing the MSW to burn at a higher heat and thereby
reducing the amount of ash produced. According to the Integrated
Waste Services Association, communities with WTE plants still
recycle an average of 25 percent of their MSW, which is
competitive with non-WTE communities. </p>
<p>Today, 121 WTE facilities manage approximately 16 percent of
all MSW generated nationwide, according to the Integrated Waste
Services Association. Meanwhile, these facilities generate enough
energy each year to power more than one million homes, roughly
the same amount of energy that is supplied by 50 million barrels
of oil. </p>
<p>According to a study conducted by the U.S. Conference of
Mayors and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, besides
its ability to decrease landfill bulk of a load of MSW by up to
90 percent, a major advantage of WTE is that the energy produced
in the process is generated with about the same environmental
impact as energy produced from natural gas, and with less of an
environmental impact than energy produced from oil or coal.</p>
<p>In fact, the U.S. Department of Energy has identified WTE
technology as a major component of a plan to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions in America over the long term. According to
IWSA, modern WTE plants usually replace older oil or coal burning
facilities, which translates to improved air quality in the
communities where they operate.</p>
<p>Three primary WTE technology options are available:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Mass Burn</strong> systems burn MSW as it arrives
    at the plant, without any processing or separation. The fire
    that is created heats boilers, producing steam for industrial
    uses or for generating electricity. These plants represent
    about three-fourths of U.S. WTE plants and each burns between
    200 and 750 tons of MSW each day. Mass burn facilities are
    sized according to the everyday amount of solid waste they
    can expect (larger in a major metropolitan area, smaller in a
    rural area). </p>
    <p>Most mass burn plants can remove non-combustible steel and
    iron for recycling automatically using magnetic separation
    processes. Other non-ferrous metals can be removed from the
    leftover ash as well, also for recycling.</p>
    <p><strong>Modular Incinerators</strong> are small mass burn
    plants, with a capacity of 15 to 100 tons per day. The
    boilers for modular incinerators are built in a factory and
    shipped to the WTE site, rather than being built on the WTE
    site itself. The main advantage of a modular incinerator WTE
    is that it is flexible to a community's growth, and its
    prevailing economic conditions. If more capacity is needed,
    for example, and if the community is in a position to afford
    it, new modular WTE units can be added. These facilities are
    used primarily by small communities and also by industrial
    sites. However, costs limit the use of this technology
    because the return on investment in terms of energy produced
    over time is much lower than in mass burn plants.</p>
    <p><strong>Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF)</strong> plants process
    solid waste before it is burned. A typical plant will remove
    non-combustible items, separating things like glass, metals
    and other materials for recycling if possible. The
    combustible solid waste remaining is then shredded into
    smaller pieces for burning. RDF plants require significantly
    more sorting and handling than mass burn, but this can
    provide additional opportunities to recover recyclables and
    remove potentially environmentally harmful materials prior to
    combustion. The RDF produced using these methods can be
    burned in power boilers at factories or even at large housing
    complexes. Or they can be used at existing WTE facilities. </p>
    <p>Sometimes RDF materials are densified (or compacted at
    high pressure) into fuel pellets. The &quot;pellet fuel&quot;
    can also include sludges of different kinds that are
    by-products of water treatment in municipal or industrial
    sewage treatment plants. A major advantage of pellet fuel as
    an RDF is that a user can burn it along with other kinds of
    fuel in their existing power boilers. In essence, that means
    RDF pellet fuels can compete with traditional fuels such as
    coal on the open market.</p>
</blockquote>

</p>
<h3>Air Emissions</h3>
<p>New EPA rules which became effective in 1995 are among the
most stringent environmental standards for WTE facilities in the
world. These rules mandate that all facilities use the most
modern air pollution control equipment available to ensure that
what comes out of WTE smokestacks is as clean as possible, and is
safe for human health and the environment.</p>
<p>The fact is, burning any fuel, including MSW, can produce a
number of pollutants, including carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide
and fine particles containing heavy metal compounds. Also, other
toxic organic compounds such as dioxins are potential emissions
of any combustive activity where certain chemical compounds are
present, a situation that could take place in the WTE process.
The issue of primary concern, however is whether the
concentrations of these compounds released into the air can be
harmful to human health or the environment. </p>
<p>According to the International Waste Services Association, WTE
processes reduce potential air pollutants to &quot;benign&quot;
levels, and in many cases prevent them entirely, due to extremely
high temperatures that exist in the WTE boilers. In addition,
other air pollution &quot;scrubbing&quot; devices (which are
described below) capture gases that leave the boilers in order to
prevent any potentially harmful emissions that may have somehow
survived the high temperatures. Air emission control devices in a
WTE facility usually include:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Dry Scrubbers</strong> which &quot;wash&quot; the
    air emissions of the WTE (called the gas stream) and also
    remove any acidic gases by passing the gas stream through a
    liquid.</p>
    <p><strong>Electrostatic Precipitators (ESP)</strong> use
    high voltage electricity to remove up to 98 percent of all
    particles possibly remaining in the gas stream after passing
    through the scrubbers, including any heavy metal particles.</p>
    <p><strong>Fabric Filters (Baghouses)</strong> consist of a
    series of nearly two thousand fabric bags made of
    heat-resistant material which also filter remaining particles
    from the gas stream. According to the National League of
    Cities, fabric filters capture 99 percent of the particles
    that remain in the gas stream after the scrubber. This
    includes any large concentrations of condensed toxic organic
    compounds (such as dioxins) and heavy metal compounds that
    may remain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a properly operated facility, the air that makes it through
the pollution controls described above and into the smokestack is
&quot;clean&quot; by EPA standards. Smokestack height is an
extra, final precaution taken to assure that remaining pollutants
in the gas stream do not reach the ground in a concentration that
could even be potentially harmful. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Ash Management</h3>
<p>Waste-to-energy produces two types of ash, bottom ash and fly
ash.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Bottom Ash</strong> includes both large and
    moderate-sized unburned and unburnable matter that remains
    after the MSW has passed through the furnace, or combustion
    chamber. This ash comprises 75-90 percent of all ash produced
    in a WTE, depending on the technology employed. </p>
    <p><strong>Fly Ash</strong> is a powdery material suspended
    in the gas stream that is collected in the pollution control
    equipment. It tends to have higher concentrations of metals
    and organic materials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bottom ash and fly ash are usually combined when collected at
the WTE to facilitate storage, handling, and transportation. A
major benefit of combining the two forms of ash is that it binds
metal particles to other materials and reduces the potential that
these metals will ever leach into ground water once they are
disposed. By law, all of the ash is tested in accordance with EPA
rules before leaving the WTE facility to ensure it is safe for
disposal and possible reuse. </p>
<p>According to IWSA, research now indicates that ash from WTEs
can indeed be used safely and beneficially. One potential for
commercial reuse of WTE ash is in landfills as daily and final
cover material in place of soil. (Currently, as you'll read
later, MSW deposited in landfills is covered by dirt or another
material on a daily basis to prevent windblown litter and for
other reasons.) Ash can also be used as a substitute for the
aggregate used in road base materials, as well as in building
construction and as part of artificial offshore reefs. </p>

<h2>Sanitary Landfills</h2>
<p>The sanitary landfill is an engineered method of disposing of
MSW in the minimum amount of space using means that protect human
health and the environment. Communities use landfills to dispose
of millions of tons of the trash they create even if alternative
options like recycling, composting, WTE and source reduction are
operating at maximum efficiency. In 1994, U.S. landfills, all of
them now state-of-the-art facilities, managed about 61 percent of
MSW, according to the EPA. </p>
<p><img src="landfill.gif" alt="Landfill Diagram" align="bottom"
width="472" height="271"> </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Environmental Considerations</h3>
<p>Properly operated modern landfills are environmentally safe
means of disposal, and are closely monitored for their
environmental impact by the EPA, as well as state and local
authorities. 2,893 MSW landfills now exist in the U.S. according
to a 1995 study by the Environmental Industry Association. </p>
<p>While this is significantly less than the number of landfills
that existed just 25 years ago, it does not indicate that we face
a landfill disposal shortage or crisis of any kind. In reality,
landfill capacity for most states has increased as larger,
modern, privately-owned and operated landfills, known as
megafills, are being built to replace the smaller, &quot;town
dumps&quot; of the past.</p>
<p>By no means are modern landfills anywhere near to being
&quot;simply a hole in the ground where garbage is buried.&quot;
In fact the enforcement of strict environmental standards in the
last decade has played a major role in decreasing the overall
number of landfills. Prior to the mid-1970s, several landfills
around the nation were indeed basically open pits that accepted
all forms of garbage including hazardous wastes. Practices like
these are no longer permitted, and are in fact closely monitored
by government authorities as well as civic and environmental
groups. Municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLs) are now tightly
regulated under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA, sometimes spoken as &quot;rickrah&quot;)
passed by Congress in 1976. In 1991 the U.S. EPA published a new
set of strict Landfill Rules that now serve as the basis for
state regulatory and permitting requirements.</p>
<p>Landfills that were in operation on the date of the issuance
of the EPA rules have until October 1997 to either comply fully
with these new environmental regulations or must close in a
responsible manner stipulated by the regulations. That means, the
landfill operators of facilities that can't comply must undertake
an extensive series of mitigation and land reclamation processes.
Most new landfills and any expansion of existing landfills must
fully comply with the EPA rules already. </p>
<p>Because today's landfills need to operate with unquestioned
safety and efficiency, it often can take five or more years from
the time a site is selected until designs, permit applications,
and public hearings are completed and the facility is built. In
addition to complying with EPA rules, many factors are taken into
consideration when siting a landfill. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>How a Landfill Operates </h3>
<p>Obviously, in its most basic sense, a landfill is a place
where garbage is hauled, deposited and then buried. But if you
look at a modern landfill in closer detail it is really much more
complicated than that. A typical, modern landfill is divided into
a series of sections called cells. When the solid waste is hauled
to a landfill, it isn't just strewn haphazardly. Rather it is
placed on what is called a working face, which is a portion of a
landfill cell that is currently exposed and available for trash
disposal. Only limited sites in the landfill are exposed at any
given time to minimize exposure of the landfill's contents to
elements like wind and rain. In fact, because a landfill is
filled so systematically, often modern landfill operators can
pinpoint where a specific truck's load of garbage was deposited
even days, weeks or months afterward. </p>
<p>At the conclusion of each day's activity in a cell, a layer of
earth (or as noted before, another material such as ash) called
daily cover is spread across the compacted waste in the cell to
minimize odor, prevent windblown litter, and prevent insect and
vermin problems. The daily cover may also consist of a layer of
foam materials or sheets of synthetic materials. The landfill
operator moves from working face to working face, and from cell
to cell as the landfill gradually fills over periods of many
years, even decades. </p>
<p>But as noted, a modern landfill is more than just a hole in
the ground where we dump trash and forget it. Today's landfills
include multiple safeguards to contain wastes and isolate them
from surrounding water and soil. In many cases, for example, such
safeguards involve a protective liner to prevent filtration.
Liners may be made of compacted clay or impermeable materials
such as plastic. When clay is used, the layer may be as much as
ten feet thick. All this site preparation is done so that any
liquid entering the landfill can be controlled and treated
externally, or retained inside the landfill, rather than being
permitted to pass through the site and come out the other side.</p>
<p>Rain, snow, and other liquids created by the compaction and
decomposition of solid waste that can seep from a landfill cell
is known as leachate. Leachate is considered by EPA and landfill
operators as a potential pollutant of surface waters like lakes,
rivers, streams or the ocean&#151;or groundwater which is the
source of most of our drinking water. With this in mind, a
network of drains is installed at the bottom of the landfill to
collect any leachate that has percolated through the wastes of
the landfill. The leachate is then pumped to waste water recovery
points for treatment. </p>
<p>Groundwater monitoring wells are installed around the
perimeter of the landfill to ensure that surrounding groundwater
is not contaminated with leachate. Should a liner system fail by
breaking or deteriorating, leak detectors installed under the
liners would signal the presence of leachate, allowing immediate
corrective action to take place that prevents any further
movement of leachate from the landfill toward nearby groundwater
or surface waters.</p>
<p>Gases emanating from the landfill are also closely monitored
and controlled. As the organic portion of waste (i.e., food and
yard wastes) decomposes in a landfill, large amounts of methane
gas and carbon dioxide are produced. Methane is controlled. As a
result, under RCRA and the Clean Air Act, landfills are required
to monitor gas both on their surfaces and around their
boundaries. </p>
<p>As cells to the landfill are sealed off, venting systems are
installed that prevent the methane from diffusing underground.
Equipment is also installed in the vents to collect the gas that
emanates from the landfill and burn it off. In many cases, energy
is recovered from the combustion of the gases which is used on
site or sold to local homes or businesses.</p>
<p>All landfills are required to close consistent with certain
&quot;final cap&quot; environmental requirements imposed by EPA.
When landfills as a whole have reached their capacity, they are
covered with a final layer of clay and dirt and then are
re-landscaped according to closure plans drawn up in accordance
with the community. Just to be granted their license to operate
in the first place (even from day one in the case of new
landfills) operators must have a complete plan for when the site
is eventually closed, which in some case can be fifty or more
years down the road. They are also required to provide financial
assurance that ensures that financial means will exist for all
closure, post-closure and corrective action activity over the
lifetime of the landfill. </p>
<p>Once a landfill is capped, the landfill's operators are
obligated to monitor the site for gas and leachate for a minimum
of 30 years after the closure date. They also are often involved
in the ongoing efforts to reclaim the land for other uses.
Landfills can end up in time as open space for communities to use
as parks, ski slopes or even golf courses. Building any permanent
structures on landfills is less common because, as solid waste
decomposes in the landfill, the entire landscape can settle.</p>

width="398" height="182"> <br>
Like many other Americans, you collect and sort items that can be
recycled. That's good, because you help your community reduce the
amount of garbage going to the landfill. But putting items out
for collection or dropping them off at a local center is only the
first of three steps in the recycling process. It may surprise
you to learn that what you BUY is just as important as saving the
things your recycling collection center takes.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>To Market, To Market . . .</h4>
<p>Today, approximately 21% of our trash is recovered annually
for recycling. Where do these millions of pounds of recyclables
go after collection? Manufacturers use them to make new
products&#151;recycling's second step. The third and final step
returns the new products to the marketplace. This step is one
that YOU need to support if recycling is to remain part of the
solution to the country's garbage issue. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>Why Should I Buy Recycled?</h4>
<p>You &quot;close the loop&quot; when you buy items or packaging
made from recycled materials. They have now come full-circle:
from bag or bin to a manufacturer, to the store shelf, and back
to your home. And after using the item, you can start the loop
again by saving it for the local recycling program. When you buy
recycled, markets are created and a use is assured for
recyclables being collected in your community and in thousands of
others. Manufacturers will respond by continuing to use
recyclables in their products.</p>
<p>Without informed consumers and a ready market for products
made of recycled materials, local recycling programs will become
more costly and fewer recyclables may be collected and processed.
More reusable material will end up in landfills, and communities
will need to deal with an increased amount of garbage.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>How Do I Find Them?</h4>
<p><img src="ladybox.gif" lowsrc="lladybox.gif"
alt="Lady with Cereal Box" align="right" hspace="0" width="229"
height="239"> Products and packaging made from recycled material
are everywhere&#151;in stores that sell groceries, office
supplies, auto parts, and everything in between. Recyclables are
transformed into an amazing variety of new products. Plastic milk
jugs return to yards and parks as plastic lumber and picnic
tables. Steel food cans return to the hardware store as nails and
screws. Newspapers become egg cartons. There's no limit to the
things that can be made from recyclables. </p>
<p>Many products are identified recycled or partially recycled on
the label or on the product itself. Others may contain recycled
material but may not be identified. For instance, there's a good
chance that the glass containers, aluminum and steel cans,
paperboard boxes and plastic detergent bottles you buy are made
of some recycled material. </p>
<p>Some products and packaging also have labels describing the
amount of &quot;pre-consumer&quot; and &quot;post-consumer&quot;
waste that was used. &quot;Pre-consumer&quot; waste is also known
as &quot;manufacturing waste,&quot; and includes any scraps,
trimmings, over-runs, etc., from the manufacturing process.
&quot;Post-consumer&quot; waste is a product or other material
that has served its intended use and has been discarded and then
collected for recycling. </p>

<h4>Buying A New Appliance</h4>
<p>Every year, Americans discard over 8 million old or broken
appliances. Dryers that don't dry. Washers that don't wash.
Freezers that can't freeze, and ovens that won't heat. <img
src="pigbank.gif" lowsrc="lpigbank.gif" alt="Piggy Bank"
align="right" hspace="0" width="81" height="102"> </p>
<p>We also replace older appliances because we want the
convenience of new features, or to reduce our home's energy
consumption. New appliances can use up to 50% less
energy&#151;which means we pay a smaller electric bill and help
conserve energy. </p>
<p>You may be thinking about buying a new appliance. Perhaps you
already have. If so, there are some important facts you should
know about disposing of your old appliance properly. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>Appliances and the Environment</h4>
<p>Until recently, many worn-out appliances were simply put in
landfills. Today, a growing number of states are prohibiting this
for two reasons. Appliances take up too much space, and they
contain valuable metals that can be easily recovered and re-used. </p>
<p>Whether recycled or landfilled, proper handling of an
appliance is important to protect our environment. You can do
your part by having an old unit removed by the store where you
purchased the new one (and finding out how they dispose of them);
having it removed by a reputable scrap recycler; by donating an
old working unit to charity; or by participating in an appliance
collection day in your community. </p>
<p>Refrigerators and freezers that cool our food contain
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), a refrigerant that can harm the ozone
layer when released in the air. Under the federal Clean Air Act,
the use of CFC is being phased out. However, if your old
appliance contains CFC, it can be safely removed by a trained
technician. </p>
<p>Appliances made before 1979 may also have motors or other
electric parts with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), an
insulator. Once your appliance has been collected, any PCBs can
be removed and properly disposed. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>Appliance Recycling</h4>
<p><img src="magnet.gif" lowsrc="lmagnet.gif" alt="Magnet"
align="left" hspace="0" width="106" height="169"> Recycling
appliances isn't new! In fact, it's estimated that half of all
major household appliances are currently being recycled to
collect scrap steel, copper, and aluminum. </p>
<p>After any CFCs or PCBs have been removed, your appliance is
shredded. The steel is separated and shipped to a mill, where it
can be remade into one of many new products. The other metals are
also separated and sent to mills. The remaining
material&#151;rubber, plastic, and glass&#151;is called
&quot;fluff,&quot; and can be landfilled.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>Illegal Dumping</h4>
<p><img src="nodump.gif" lowsrc="lnodump.gif" alt="No Dumping"
align="right" hspace="0" width="107" height="78"> Making sure
your old appliance is handled properly can also prevent it from
becoming illegally dumped. Such dumping poses many problems. An
abandoned appliance is an invitation for other people to do the
same, spoiling our landscape. Vermin can breed in them, and CFCs
or PCBs may leak into the air or soil. </p>
<p>Illegally dumped appliances also pose dangers to children, who
may become trapped inside while playing. Older refrigerators and
freezers with door latches are especially hazardous, and many
states require that doors on these units be removed to prevent
accidents. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>Tips on Disposal and Recycling</h4>
<p><em><strong>Do</strong></em><em> consider donating a working
appliance to charity.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Do</strong></em><em> ask the store where you buy a
new appliance if it will remove the old unit.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Do</strong></em><em> learn if your community is
planning an appliance collection day.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Do</strong></em><em> use a reputable scrap
recycler and ask for a receipt to show that the appliance has
been properly handled.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Don't</strong></em><em> be an illegal
dumper&#151;others will follow your example. Research by Keep
America Beautiful, Inc. shows that some people will dump and
litter where material has already accumulated.</em> </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Americans generate 250 million scrap tires each year&#151;one
for every citizen. In 1995, 69% of all tires generated were
recovered; a 26% increase from 1994. Fewer tires were sent to
landfills or stockpiled in 1995 largely resulting from a growing
technology known as Tire Derived Fuel (TDF), which burns shredded
tires for energy that can be used by electric utilities, pulp and
paper mills, and cement kilns. Increased demand for scrap tires
provides a promising outlook for tire reuse and recovery, which
will help decrease the number of tires illegally dumped and
stockpiled. </p>
<p><br>

<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>Despite significant strides in recovery rates, tires are still
stockpiled or illegally dumped. Tire piles can create many
problems. (Disease-carrying rodents and mosquitoes thrive in the
standing water of tire piles and use them as breeding sites,
creating a public health hazard.) Tire piles are also a hazard
because, if set afire, they are difficult to extinguish and under
uncontrolled conditions, create air, ground and water pollution. </p>
<p>In response to the health and environmental hazards associated
with stockpiled and illegally dumped tires, 47 states have passed
scrap tire regulations mandating the proper management of tires.
Many states also charge disposal fees of $1-$3 when replacement
tires are purchased to eliminate stockpiles and help fund
alternative management methods. Since tires often rise to the
surface of a landfill due to the resiliency of the rubber, many
states require tires to be shredded or split before they are
landfilled. Though they take up less space when shredded, tires
can be difficult and expensive to shred due to their steel belts
and tough design. Some states completely ban tires from their
landfills to encourage other uses.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Tire Derived Fuel</h3>
<p>Scrap tires have historically been a big challenge for solid
waste management. Tire-Derived Fuel (TDF), however, is playing a
large role in meeting the challenge. In 1995, 130 million tires
were burned for energy according to the Scrap Tire Management
Council (STMC). As a petroleum by-product, tires have an energy
value nearly equal to oil, and 25% higher than coal. Recent
reports have shown that TDF is comparable to fossil fuel and, in
many cases, burns cleaner and cheaper than coal. It also has a
higher heating value. </p>
<p>Industry is seeing the opportunities in TDF and the market for
scrap tires continues to expand. Shredded tires are used as a
fuel in dedicated tire-to-energy facilities, in pulp and paper
mills, and in cement kilns. Today, approximately 38 cement kilns
burn tire-derived fuel; only 2 cement kilns used TDF in 1990. The
high temperature inside a cement kiln provides for the complete
combustion of tires, without black smoke and odors that are
normally associated with uncontrolled burning tires, according to
the STMC. </p>
<h4>Tire Derived Fuel Markets</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>80 million consumed as fuel 38 cement kilns burn TDF (only
    2 in 1990)<br>
    14 kilns are testing<br>
    15 paper mills burn TDF<br>
    16 industrial plants including utilities burn TDF<br>
    2 whole-tires-to-energy plants</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other areas of research and development include pyrolysis and
gasification. The goal of both technologies is to convert tires
into fuel gas and oil with a marketable residual char (carbon
black) and steel. Research has been conducted in this area since
1965, but there has been no successful commercial application for
the technology to date. While the char is not as suitable in the
tire industry, it is suitable as a solid powder fuel.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Reuse of Tires</h3>
<p>Scrap tires are extending their lives through a variety of
uses. Product research and business development will continue to
increase the number of scrap tires diverted from the waste
stream. According to the Recycled Products Guide newsletter, a
company in North Carolina takes worn racing tires and makes
everything from doormats to jewelry. Another in Washington state
has designed products made from used tires to maintain hiking
trails and reduce soil erosion. Its products are being used in a
number of national forests around the nation. </p>
<p>There are many other examples of practical, effective uses for
discarded tires, including: </p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Filler in new tires </li>
    <li>Molded goods and manufactured parts </li>
    <li>Automotive applications </li>
    <li>Fish habitats, erosion control, playground equipment </li>
    <li>Landfill cover, composting medium drainage systems and
        absorbent </li>
</ul>
<p>Highway and road applications is another use that states are
using to manage scrap tires. &quot;Rubber asphalt&quot; is made
by blending crumb rubber with asphalt, with the rubber comprising
up to 25% of the mix. California, Arizona, and Florida use crumb
rubber in many of their road projects.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>As markets for scrap tires continue to expand across the
country, communities and tire retailers will find it easier to
manage tires generated in their community. Innovative ideas for
the reuse of scrap tires indicate the potential for diverting an
increasing number of tires from the waste stream and recovering
the millions of illegally dumped and stockpiled tires. </p>
