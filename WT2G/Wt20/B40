<p>Subject: Being a young single mother </p>

<p>I am 21 years old and I am the mother of a 2 year old. I had
my daughter before I became a Christian and now I am having a
hard time finding people I can relate to. Most Christian mothers
I meet are married and it is hard for me to identify with them. I
have been looking for some answers everywhere. I just need some
Chrisian friends who don't look down on me for what I did in the past.
Can anyone give me any advice on how I can meet male and female
companions? </p>

<P>OK,hi. I just wanted to say that I think someone should include teenagers problems in this site. I mean, I'm 15, and a female, and I need a place to turn to at times I can't go to church or talk to my parents. I have come extemely close to doing drugs, and though no one thinks that is any big deal, it's very hard to turn away and know that my reward will hopefully come later. I have sinned many, many times, but I always turn to God. I think us teens need a place to turn to late at night for support. Maybe even a chat room.

<P>Feel like talking to a 42 year old Christian male?  I am happily
married, 2 children, and hurt for the kids that have to make
the kinds of decisions that you are faced with.  If I am a little
too "old", thats ok.  At least you are reaching out for Christian
support.  Good move.  Maybe a teenager will respond.  
Here if you want...........

<P> Denise,
<P>
I think a teen chat room would be a great idea.  I've checked
Out the chat rooms on aol and they are serving up a bunch
Of garbage.
<P>
Don't buy all the lies about drugs and alcohol.  Your life
Is far to valuable to waste on them.  Find friends who won't
Drag you down.  Yes, temptation is great, but God is greater
Than your biggest struggles.
<P>Hang in there.  Don't put yourself in situations where you'll
Be tempted to fall.  But remember, if you do fall, God's forgiveness
Is greater than any of our sins.  I'll be praying for you.
<P>
Sincerely yours in Christ,
<P>
Joey O'Connor

<p>Subject: teenagers problems
<p>I'm Jo. As a teen, I had no adults to talk to....I did 
choose to try drugs.  I wasted years of my life...running 
from all the hurt and pain I thought drugs would help me 
deal with.  I'm 44 now.  Drugs have not been a part of my 
life for over 20 years...but I always wonder if I would 
have been the first women into outer space had I followed my
dreams--instead of allowing the enemy to deceive me...Or 
maybe an under water explorer of oceans?  a writer?  I had 
many dreams...drugs temporarily robbed me of life, of 
dreams...even after I was freed from their chains, it took 
much time to learn how to dream again....and forgive myself
(and others) for the dreams that never were....
Jesus does restore much when we finally allow Him to help us 
become who He meant us to be...but why let the enemy (satan)
steal any part of your life?  His job is: to steal, to kill,
to destroy... and he is very good at it.  But...greater is 
HE that is in you...than he that is in the world.
I am alive and free today because mom and grandma never
gave up praying for me...Prayer changes things.
Thanks for reaching out.  Thanks for letting me share.

<p>Subject: Teenagers' Problem </p>

<p>Being a young single motherI feel very sad for the teenagers
of this age. Teenagers are supposerly to be the best time of
one's life. It should be time with the teenager receive love and
care, a time when they learn to grow in the Lord, a time to lay
the foundation for the future. I feel that it would really be a
good idea to have a Teenagers' chat room. A place where teenagers
can learn from each other. Also, I suggest that this chat room
should be under guidance from someone. I am not trying to
restrict the young. I just feel that teenagers need guidance,
just as adults need guidance too. </p>

<p>Subject: My Testimony</p>

<p>I'm fourteen. I used to smoke. I also drank, a little.<br>
I felt that I was slipping away from God. When I turned 13<br>
and was old enough to go with my youth group to a youth <br>
retreat at the Living Faith Bible College in Caroline, <br>
Alberta. The first time I went, I was soooo bored,because you<br>
sit there and listen to speakers. I came home from the retreat<br>
with my heart harder than ever. Then several months went by<br>
and I decided to give the youth retreat one last try. And<br>
I got delivered from my smoking and drinking and now I feel<br>
God right here with me. Please if you drink or smoke or do<br>
drugs or sex, don't hesitate to ask God to help you.<br>
Because he's been through everything that you'll ever go through.<br>
Your's in Christ<br>

<p>I really admire you for the change you allowed God to make in
your life. When I was your age, I was doing things similar to
what you where doing. Now, I am a single mother because at age 18
I got pregnant. My daughter brought me back to Christ but I never
should have left him. Please, whatever you do, never forget how much
God loves you. </p>

<p>Subject: Freedom in Christ

<p>I've been raised in a Christian home all my life.  I've been told what is wrong and what is right but i feel like all the moral decisions I have made in my life were not my own, but what I have been conditioned to do.  I feel trapped in my decisions and was wondering how to break this pattern.

<p>Subject: Freedom In Christ / Response
</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">You say that while growing up, you were told "what is wrong and what is right."  That's a great gift that parents can offer their children however it is only half the gift.  The other gift is to tell your child WHY something is right or wrong.  Without taking the time to instruct their kids on the "why", parents are unknowingly raising their kids in a legalistic environment.  The danger of this is that when the child grows older, he/she may not be able to consistently make moral decisions on their own.  Why? Because as kids, they were never taught the moral reason why a behavior is either bad or good.  They were only taught that it was bad or good.  This is not to fault your parents.  They were doing what they felt was right which it was.  It just wasn't the whole picture.  However, If you are mature enough to ask the question, you are mature enough to understand that that's water under the bridge.  Learn from it and add the moral reason why when you raise your kids.  Regarding your comment about feeling trapped, may I say that you are not telling yourself the truth.  Doing the "right" thing is never restricting.  On the contrary, it gives you the freedom to live.  All the moral training and benefits of living a moral life can be found in Proverbs and the New Testiment.  If you don't yet have an NIV version with study footnotes, may I suggest you buy one at your local Christain Bookstore.  One final thought: if you have given your life to Christ, the Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth and will warn you if you are about to make a wrong decision.  Be receptive to and welcome those quiet, holy warnings.  They are a gift from God!</font></p>

<p>Subject: freedom in christ</p>

<p>Christianity is not a set of rules and moral decisions.<br>
So many times people view Christianity in that light. I<br>
also grew up in a so called &quot;Christian home.&quot; I thought<br>
Christianity was believing in God and &quot;doing what is
right.&quot;<br>
However, I have come to realize that Christianity is a <br>
relationship with Jesus - an intimate relationship. Once<br>
that relationship is established, it grows and grows and <br>
your heart changes. The desire to make &quot;moral
decisions&quot; is<br>
no longer a delima. When you are in line with God, you <br>
naturally want what he wants. So my advice---Seek him. Let<br>
him deal with your heart.<br>
<br>

<p>Subject: What to believe</p>

<p>Am working with a Jehovah Witness, and need to know what to
say, and how to defend the truth. He says KJV is(was) translated
wrong, New World Translation is right. I know that he is wrong, but
he is very srtong in his beliefs. I emailed CRI ( www.equip.com )
for advise, am still waiting for response. Please let the Lord work
through someone and help a brother in need. Thank you.<br>

<p>Subject: WHAT TO BELIEVE</p>

<p>OKAY BROTHER, LETS TALK STRAIGHT TALK. I DON'T HAVE MY BIBLE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, DO NOT FRETT THOUGH, I KNOW WHAT THE WORD
SAYS!!!</p>

<p>FIRST THE BIBLE SPEAKS NOT TO ARGUE THE WORD OF GOD. SATAN
WILL USE THIS MAN WHO IS A JEHOVAH WITNESS TO TRY AND CAUSE
CONFUSION IN YOUR LIFE!!</p>

<p>AND LET ME SAY, CONFUSION IS NOT OF GOD. YOU NEED TO STAY IN
THE WORD OF GOD (KING JAMES VERSION) AND HOLD ON TO THOSE PROMISES MADE
BY GOD TO US AND LET ME SAY THAT IF YOU LOVE THE LORD JESUS CHRIST,
THEN YOU PRAY TO HIM TO GIVE YOU THE RIGHT WORDS TO SAY TO THIS
MAN BUT REMEMBER DO NOT ARGUE!! GOD SAYS TO SEPARATE OURSELFS FROM THE
DARKNESS AND DO NOT LET OURSELVES GET CAUGHT UP IN SATANS WEB OF
DECEIT. </p>

<p>SATAN IS OUT TO DO THREE THINGS AND THEY ARE 1)KILL 2)STEAL 3)DESTROY,
NOW BECAUSE YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN DO NOT ALLOW WHAT YOUR CO-WORKER
SEEMS TO BELIEVE CLOUD YOUR TRUE BELIEFS IN OUR WONDERFUL AND
AWESOME HOLY GOD. I CAN SAY THIS TO YOU FROM EXPERIENCE, SATAN
WILL SEND ANYONE TO YOUR HOME,OFFICE MARRIAGE, TO TRY AND CONFUSE,
KILL, STEAL, OR DESTROY ANYTHING THAT YOU HOLD DEAR AND IMPORTANT
IN YOUR LIFE. I SUGGEST THAT YOU SPEAK WITH YOUR PASTOR ABOUT
SCRIPTURES YOU CAN GIVE THIS MAN AND IF HE TRYS TO ARGUE HIS
POINTS AND BELIEVES, AS THEY SAY &quot;DON'T EVEN GO
THERE&quot;!!! </p>

<p><br>
DO NOT EVER GIVE SATAN THE UPPERHAND OVER YOU. IF YOU WOULD LIKE
A CHRISTIAN FRIEND TO SEND YOU SOME MATERIAL AND SOME NICE MUSIC<br>
TO HELP YOUR SOUL AND STRENTHEN YOUR SPIRIT, THEN WRITE TO :</p>

<p>ANGELA FAYARD PO BOX 32383 KNOXVILLE TN 37930-2383</p>

<p>GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS YOU ALWAYS.</p>

<p>Subject: Talking to Jehovah's Witness...<br>
</p>

<p>Talking to Jehovah's Witness believing KJV wrong translation<br>
Post: Draw attention away from discussion of translations. Rather<br>
focus on the person and work of Christ. Since he will not<br>
believe in the deity of Christ and His identity as Jehovah<br>
God, challenge him with prophecies and fulfillments, for <br>
example, Isa. 40:1-3 and John 1:23, Isa. 7:14 and Matt. 1:23<br>
Have him look up these verses in his New World Translation.<br>
Even in the NWT, these verses speak of Christ's deity as<br>
well as His position as Savior.<br>

"If you love me, you will obey what I command.  And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever -- the Spirit of Truth.

<P>I like this verse because obedience is where the rubber meets the road.  We can believe in God, even have oodles of Bible knowledge.  But if we do not put into practice that which we know, of what use is our faith?  Obedience is the key to experiencing the fullness of Christ.  And then, the Holy Spirit lives within us forever, always ready to counsel us so that we may make the best decisions for ourselves and those around us.

<P>This is my favorite verse because I think it is totally awsome that God would send the Holy Spirit to dwell in our hearts when we accept Jesus as our Savior.  If Christ is your savior the Holy Spirit dwells in your heart and is with you at all times.  You can't get any closer than that.

<P>Rev. 21:7,8 are some of my favorite because it's God speaking from His throne after the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ was completed on the cross. No one knows God's own grace, keeping power and faithfulness better than God Himself:

<P>"He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son. But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars--their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur.  This is the second death."

<P>Philippians 2:13 has been a standard of encouragement in times when things did not make sence. I do not accept everything has sent from the hand of God but I do believe that the blessings of God are dominant over the curses of sin and the attacks of our enemy.

<P>Psalm 46:10 is my "home" verse.  "Be still and know that I am God."
This has always calmed me in tense circumstances or situations.  It
is like He is telling me to simply calm down.  "I am still God, you
are still Bob, and I have total control of the situation.  Look to Me,
be still, and experience my peace."  Doesn't get much better than that.

<p>Be still and know that I am God</p>

<p>I totally agree with you on this verse. This verse is very<br>
convicting to me. So often, I run to God with my trials and<br>
I plead and talk to him. In other words I run the entire<br>
conversation. God commands us to &quot;Be still.&quot; I ask
myself,<br>
&quot;Laura, how often to you just sit, humbly, in the presence<br>
of the mighty God and listen?&quot; The answer-- not enough.<br>

<p>Be still and know that I am God</p>

<p>I agree with your comments. Additionally in Lamentations
3:24-26 NASB &quot;The LORD is my portion,&quot; says my soul,
&quot;therefore I will hope in him.&quot; The LORD is good to
those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him. It is good
that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.&quot;
Although those words are soothing, it is difficult for me to
wait. When I do wait and am quiet before the Lord, He always
comes through.<br>

<p>Love is very patient and kind, never jealous or envious, never boastful or 
proud, never haughty or selfish or rude.<BR>

	Love does not demand its own way. It is not irritable or touchy. It does not 
hold grudges and will hardly even notice when others do it wrong. It is never 
glad about injustice, but rejoices whenever truth wins out. <BR>

	If you love someone you will be loyal to him no matter what the cost. You 
will always believe in him, always expect the best of him, and always stand 
your ground in defending him.<BR>
	All the special gifts and powers from God will someday come to an end, but 
love goes on forever.<BR>

	There are three things that remain-----faith, hope, and love----and the 
greatest of these is love. <BR><BR>

<p>because you are sons/lack of the feminine</p>
<p>I read this verse and it fills me with righteous anger! This is the <br>
major problem with traditional Christianity--lack of the feminine. This is a <br>
male god talking to men on the earth through the masculine spirit. It seems a <br>
bit too excluding of women to me. Christianity is supposed to be a loving, <br>
welcoming religion, yet this seems to only apply to men. I'd love to hear <br>
others' responses!</p>

<p>Subject: favorite verses</p>
<p> It is my opinion that when reading the Bible you have to keep an open mind. God bases 
the Christian household on the woman. The husband is the head of the house, but he could not
run it without a strong woman at his side. If you see a happy family you can bet the mother is 
the cause.  If you see an unhappy family you can bet it is because of the mother. Read Proverbs 31 and see what all a woman is .<P>
The Bible puts a man in leadership roles and not many women because people down through history held 
what a man said over what a woman said.  Only in recent years have the voices of women began to be heard. <P>
The Bible is God's Holy Word, but let's face it. There are several translations
being used. There is one where phrases like "he\she" are used.
If you can get through  barriers like language, inturpetation,human interference and see God's intended message, i think all of us 
would benefit.

<p>&quot;We love Him because He first loved us.&quot; I John 4:19 </p>

<p>This is one of my favorite verses. It reminds me that if I
would be more Christlike, that I must be the first to extend a
hand of friendship or a smile. I can't just wait for others to be
nice to me. I need to be nice first. </p>

<p>When I'm at the store or the bank, I need to make sure I smile
and say hi and ask how they're doing. I shouldn't be so
preoccupied to not extend myself like the Saviour did. </p>

<p>This verse affects me when I think how others can like us if
we first like them, others may be charitable to us because we
were first charitable to them. </p>

<p>&quot;...and Love is the greatest of the three.&quot; </p>

<p>This verse if one of the most beautiful verses in the bible to
me, it inspires me to respect and cherish the people that mean
the most to me in my life. I try to live by this verse and
respect the love of God every day! I know that God loves me in
this way and I should love Him and others in the same way also. </p>

<p>God's steadfast love</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I was struggling with bitterness and not
wanting to face some people. The words &quot;God's steadfast love
never ceases, they never come to an end&quot; however, I was
unable to find the verse. After prayer with a friend, I shared
the words that kept coming to my mind but did not know the
reference. She said the reference was Lamenations 3. . .This is
the verses the Lord gave to me. Lamentations 3:17-26 NASB
&quot;my soul is bereft of peace, I have forgotten what happiness
is; so I say, &quot;Gone is my glory, and my expectation from the
Lord.&quot; Remember my affliction and my bitterness, the
wormword and the gall! My soul continually thinks of it and is
bowed down within me. But this I call to mind, and therefore I
have hope: The steadfastlove of the LORD never ceases, his
mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great
is thy faithfulness. 'The LORD is my portion,' says my sould,
'therefore I will hope in him.' The LORD is good to those who
wait for him, to the soul that seeks him. It is good that one
should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.&quot; </p>

<HR><P><H4>Introduction</H4></P>
<P>Because the World Wide Web is growing so rapidly,
this particular feature of the GreenMoney On-Line Guide will
be <EM>permanently</EM> under construction. The Web is
already is very expansive sphere of information. While a
number of good search tools are available and evolving to
help you find your way around the Web, we believe that Guides
such as ours will play an important role in helping people
navigate within portions of the Web that are of special
interest to them.</P>
<P>If you have added the GreenMoney On-Line Guide to your
Hot List, we think you may be more interested than the
average Internaut in the following Web sites. <A
href="/gmg/gmgform2.htm">Feedback</A> is
always welcome!</P>
<HR><H4>Directories</H4>
<P><!--Note: If your organization has a Web site you believe should be included in one of the following directories, please let us know!--></P>
<UL><LI><A href="/gmg/wsrb.htm">Socially
Responsible Business Guide</A> This feature
highlights Web sites maintained by businesses that are
members of Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), the
Council on Economic Priorities (CEP), and/or the Co-op
America Business Network (CABN)</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><A href="http://www.tbzweb.com/home.htm">True Business Zeal</A> A directory of socially responsible business opportunities, employment opportunities, wholesale offerings to retailers, and small business support services.</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><A href="http://tbzweb.com/srinvest/index.htm">S-R-Invest</A>
If you have already cruised through our
Galleries related to Socially Responsible Investing (SRI),
you might want to skip this directory. Since gathering
information on which to base investment decisions has become
a very popular use of the Web, we have bundled all of our
SRI-related sites into this one directory for easy addition
to Hot Lists everywhere.</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><A href="/gmg/wpubco.htm">SRI
Public Company Web</A> GreenMoney is not in the
business of offering <EM>buy, sell</EM> <EM>or hold</EM>
recommendations to investors. The purpose of this directory
is point out Web sites maintained by publicly-owned companies
that are followed by some SRI stock analysts and portfolio
managers.</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><A href="/gmg/paula.htm">Environmentalist
Web</A> A central reason why GreenMoney
exists is to promote environmentally responsible behavior by
consumers and businesses. Here are some of the organizations
on the front lines of the struggle to reverse the decline of
the Earth's life support system.</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><A href="/gmg/campaign.htm">Campaign
for Energy Efficiency</A> Getting maximum use out
of the energy we consume and relying as much as possible on
renewable energy sources are key facets of good environmental
stewardship. Here are some good sources of energy efficiency
information on the Web.</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><A href="/gmg/ecotour.htm">Ecotourism
Resources on the Web</A> GreenMoney heartily
endorses travel that is designed to minimize the impact on
the places you visit. Here are some Ecotourism resources that
can help you plan your trips.</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><A href="/gmg/mission.htm">Mission:
Social Responsibility</A> Here are some Web sites
maintained by dedicated folks and organizations who are
dedicated to promoting social responsibility.</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><A href="/gmg/ecomalls.htm">Cyberspace
Malls for the Environmentally Conscientious</A>
In all fairness, we are not the only place to find
earth-friendly goods. Here are some others.</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><A href="/gmg/wprogorg.htm">Progressive
Organizations</A> &quot;Progressive&quot; is in
the eye of the beholder, but these organizations might
interest those interested in &quot;Social
Responsibility&quot; -- which of course is also in the eye of
the beholder.</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><A href="/gmg/wmedia.htm">Media
on the Web</A> Alas, we are not the only media
organization to develop a site on the Web. Here are some
others that might be of interest.</LI>

rousing session on &quot;Shareholder Activism&quot; closed
the conference on a motivated note.</P>
<P>At the conference, the 1996 SRI Service Award was
presented to Amy Domini, the Founder and Chair of Domini
Social Equity Fund, a no-load mutual fund for social
investors. She is a principal of Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini
&amp; Co., Inc., specialists in corporate accountability

awarded at the conference. The honor went to John Guerard,
the director of quantitative research at Vantage Global

<BODY>
<CENTER><H1>WHAT IS TIGERS&#174;</H1></CENTER><P>       <b>TIGERS&#174;</b>
Success Series is an organizational consulting firm specializing in
healthy group dynamics, responsible organizational change, and team
development. TIGERS' mission is to help organizations develop effective
leaders, and to help those leaders build balanced work and team systems.</P>
<P>     <b>TIGERS</b> was born of the question, "What is
necessary to develop an ethical, quality focused, productive and
successful group of people?" Based on educational, business and
psychological group dynamics' studies, six universal values converged as
vital components for successful teams: <b>T</b>rust, <b>I</b>nterdependence,
<b>G</b>enuineness, <b>E</b>mpathy, <b>R</b>isk
and<b> S</b>uccess - or in short, <b>TIGERS</b>.</P><P
>       As a values and responsibility-based team development philosophy,
TIGERS promotes a balance between people and work quality. The six
values demand integrity, self-reflection, personal accountability, and
work excellence from all people within any organization of two or more
who have come together to achieve something of value. A force is
generated which energizes people, promotes success, and develops
cohesiveness through empathy and respect.</P><P>        Healthy and productive
teams are the life blood of business today. They're like well-tuned
machines: the more you take care of them, tinker with them and tune them
up when needed, the better they perform. But people aren't machines...
And a simple tweaking isn't always enough.</P>
<P>     And, real transformation doesn't come from trendy management
techniques. Techniques are tools &#151; great for tweaking the system
but not always directed at the core issues that help organizations
become healthy and productive. And a healthy team does not mangle
people; nor does a healthy business, a healthy family or a healthy
community. TIGERS is very effective at what it does. It is capable of
pouncing on opportunities that will feed your organization's survival
well into the 21st century.</P>
<P>     If you're looking for a way to help your team &#150; or yourself
&#150; be more successful with more people more of the time, TIGERS is
the organizational development success series you've been looking for.</P><P

<BODY>
<H2>ECOTRAVEL</H2>
<H3>The Adventurous Journey Towards Sustainability</H3>
<P>Travel is big business. In fact, it's the biggest business &#151; $3.5 trillion dollars spent annually. The fastest growing segment of the travel industry is Ecotravel, currently grossing an estimated $335 billion a year. Travel employs 127 million people worldwide. Approximately 450 million tourists crisscross the globe annually. That number may well increase to 650 million by the turn of the century. The impact is felt everywhere.</P>
<P>Ecotravel goes by many names: adventure travel, nature-based travel, environmental or ecological travel, scientific expeditions, cross-cultural exchange, language study, reality tours, earth restoration projects, and others. Ecotravel is geared for concerned individuals who want to understand and preserve the planet's natural beauty. The basic assumption is that anyone who actually sees a rain forest or a 300-year-old tree will value it and want it preserved. Sustainable tourism requires the development of recreational travel which is profitable, without depleting wildlife, the environment, or native cultures.</P>
<P>Where are people going on eco-adventures? The top destinations for 1995, according to the American Society of Travel Agents, are (in order): Central America, South America, Canada, USA, the Caribbean, Antarctica, and Australia. Another important ecotravel destination is Africa. Kenya is one country that knows nature is valuable. Kenya Wildlife Service recorded $24 million of revenues from wildlife tourism in 1990. For 1995, it projects $54 million. Twenty-five percent of earnings are paid out to communities in areas adjacent to parks and reserves. A recent study of Amboseli National Park in Kenya determined that each lion there was worth $27,000 and each elephant herd was worth $610,000 in tourist revenue per year. The country employs 55,000 people in its wildlife tourism industry alone.</P>
<P>Ecotravel adventures begins with planning. Having chosen your destination, the heart of the explorer arises. Educate yourself about your destination. Learn about the history, culture, language, and natural environment of your destination. Use the library, tour operators, visitor centers, and maps to aid your research. The understanding you develop will deepen your appreciation of the chosen destination.</P>
<P>Many people choose to make a positive impact with their vacation by being a volunteer &#151; working at a National Park or wildlife refuge, cleaning up trash, planting trees, maintaining trails, feeding fish, or monitoring wildlife population. Habitat for Humanity has a global village program that sends volunteer work groups around the world to build housing. Other options include tracking Humpback whales off Hawaii, building solar ovens in Kenya, saving vanishing rain forests in Mexico, or excavating medieval Moscow.</P>
<P>Consider that while travel itself is not right or wrong, the impact you make as a traveler may be.</P>
<P><B>ECOTOUR OPERATORS</B></P>
<P>At present no industry-accepted rating of ecotour operators exists. Therefore, it is necessary to undertake research and discover which ecotour operator most suits your individual needs, has the least impact on the host population and environment, and maximizes the amount of money that goes directly to the local community and to natural resource conservation. Ask if the travel company has a code of ethics. Begin by choosing an environmentally responsible tour company. Look for hotels, resorts &amp; ships that treat and dispose of waste responsibly, and look for places that use energy and water efficiently. Whether biking, hiking, rafting, or camping, treat all environments respectfully. The EcoTourism Society has an excellent in-depth checklist of questions to consider when choosing an ecotour operator. Also see the tour operators section in <I>EcoTraveler</I> magazine.</P>
<P><B>TRAVEL IDEAS</B></P>
<P>Maho Bay campground and Harmony Resort on St. John in the Virgin Islands National Park is a choice location for the ecotourist. Built by sustainable development visionary, Stanley Selengut, this Eco camp &amp; resort was built out of entirely recycled and environmentally sensitive materials. The facility was the 1994 winner of the Grand Award for Environmental Technology by <I>Popular Science </I> magazine. Harmony Resort operates strictly on sun and wind power. A third facility, utilizing self-sufficient Eco-tents has recently been completed. For more information call (800) 392-9004.</P>
<P>If your interest is to improve human understanding of the planet, the diversity of its inhabitants, and the processes that affect the quality of life on Earth, Earthwatch research expeditions are for you. They conduct 660 scientific expedition teams in 60 countries to improve the quality and management of life's resources. For information call (800) 776-0188.</P>
<P>Some options for the educated traveler: The Institute of Noetic Sciences' travel program. For information call (800) 353-2276. Visit architect Frank Lloyd Wright's properties around the country, for example, Taliesin in Wisconsin or Taliesin West in Arizona. For information call (602) 860-2700.</P>
<P>If in need of a holistic vacation; try a spiritual retreat for relaxation, education, self-reflection, or play. Call Hollyhock in British Columbia, Canada at (604) 935-6533 or Omega Institute in upstate New York at (800) 944-1001. </P>
<P><B>TRAVEL RESOURCES</B></P>
<P><B>Transitions Abroad</B></P>
<P>Since 1977, Transitions Abroad has helped independent world travelers plan their own adventurous alternatives to mass tourism. Be a Third World service volunteer, join a research expedition, take a professional seminar or hobby course, find short-term jobs and internships abroad, stay with a host family and learn a language, or join a worldwide hospitality exchange group. Transitions Abroad has several excellent publications available: </P>

<P><B>The EcoTourism Society</B></P>
<P>The EcoTourism Society (TES) is an international nonprofit organization fully dedicated to finding the resources and building the expertise to make tourism a viable tool for conservation and sustainable development. Created in 1990, the organization serves tour operators, conservation professionals, park managers, government officials, lodge owners, guides, researchers, consultants, and other professionals striving to implement ecotourism worldwide. The Society is documenting the best techniques for implementing ecotourism principles by collaborating with a growing global network of active professionals in the field.</P>
<P>TES offers education and training programs, information services, and an international network. It is working to establish global standards and criteria using state-of-the-art models.</P>
<P>TES defines ecotourism as responsible travel that conserves natural environments and sustains the well-being of local people.</P>
<P>The Society's specific goals for ecotravel are to develop low-impact tourism hotels and structures; provide local employment and industry to rural areas; provide economic support to local conservation projects and park management; and to provide opportunities for appreciation and study of local ecology by visitors and hosts.</P>
<P>TES conducts a series of workshops every year. Summer 1995 courses were: Ecotourism Planning &amp; Management, Ecolodge Planning and Design, Ecolodge Management and Operations. In 1996, TES plans to expand its course offerings. It has been working with George Washington University in Washington, D.C. on developing the International Institute of Tourism Studies. The Institute helps people develop and manage successful and environmentally-sensitive tourism businesses. For information call GWU at (703) 578-8845.</P>
<P>The next TES event is the Second International Ecolodge Forum and Field Seminar, scheduled for October 22-29, 1995, at the Fiesta Hotel in Puntarenas, Costa Rica.</P>
<P>TES has several ecotravel &amp; planning publications available:</P>

<H3>The Ethical Explorer</H3>
<P>"Tourism and adventure travel have evolved into enormous industries that greatly influence local economies, lifestyles, and attitudes. Fortunately, more responsible and discriminating travelers are emerging. Choices you make regarding your travel ... where to visit, whom to travel with, and what activities to engage in... have an impact on the cultures and the natural environments you visit as well as on the quality of your experience. At the entrance to Lake Manyara National Park in Tanzania, a sign is posted that greets the visitor with the simple message: 'Let no one say and say it to your shame, that all was beauty until you came.'</P>
<P>More and more travelers are taking this message to heart and asking the questions, How can I travel responsibly? How can my presence demonstrate a genuine respect for the local cultures and promote an ethic of care for the natural environment? Here are some questions you might ask when making your adventure travel plans:</P>
<P>1. Who benefits from the cost of your trip? Suggestion: Validate the local culture by supporting their economic efforts. Utilize locally owned guest houses and hotels, restaurants, transportation systems, and shop at local markets.</P>
<P>2. How often and in what ways will you have the opportunity to meet the local people? Suggestion: Employ local guides or make sure the tour company you use does. Be certain that your itinerary is flexible enough to take advantage of an unplanned encounter with local people.</P>
<P>3. How large of a group will you be traveling with? Suggestion: Typically, the smaller the group, the more welcome you will be. Quite simply, a group of 8 is less overwhelming than a busload of 40.</P>
<P>4. Are appropriate environmental practices employed while you are traveling? Suggestion: Question your guide about how they handle garbage, human waste, noise pollution, disturbance of wildlife, etc.</P>
<P>5. To what degree are you wanting to be "in" the country versus traveling "through" the country? Suggestion: Travel brochures often depict only the tourist sights of the country and promote a stereotypical view of the culture. Strive to learn about the culture &#151; inquire about working and living conditions, political and religious systems, the roles of women and men, etc. Several adventure travel companies and organizations offer opportunities for direct involvement with the host country through work projects, homestays, and research assistance.</P>
<P>6. Finally, how do you want to present yourself to those you meet? Suggestion: The single most important aspect of creating rich cross-cultural experiences is "attitude." Find ways of conveying a respectful curiosity and an honest acceptance of differences. Put away assumptions, expectations, and ostentation. Travel softly."</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&#150; <EM>Adventure Associates' mission is to promote an ethic of care with respect to the natural world, each other, and ourselves through adventure-based experiences. They seek to build quality relationships that foster a sense of land stewardship and personal discovery. Cris Miller can be reached by calling (206) 932-8352. </EM> </P>
<H3>ECOTOURISM CODE OF ETHICS</H3>
<P>Governments, religious groups, consumer associations, outdoor equipment businesses, the tourism industry, land management agencies, and environmental organizations have all contributed to the creation of this code of ethics for both ecotourists and ecotour operators:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Prepare in advance.</B> Learn about the people and the place you visit. Get information from your tour operator, library, and organizations working in the chosen destination.</LI>
<LI><B>Choose the right tour operator.</B> Make sure the operator runs an environmentally sound business that supports small-scale projects and limits group size.</LI>
<LI><B>Respect local customs, culture, and lifestyles.</B> Accept that other people have different, not wrong or inferior, ways of living.</LI>
<LI><B>Consider the impact of your presence.</B> The enormous amount of energy and resources you use on your trip are likely to be more than double of those used by a local person.</LI>
<LI><B>Present yourself realistically.</B> The media and the nature of tourism often glamorize Western culture and present Western tourist as wealthy travelers with few responsibilities. Sharing information about the social, environmental, and economic realities we face in the U.S. helps create more equality between hosts and guests.</LI>
<LI><B>Continue your experience when you return home.</B> Join environmental groups. Support conservation projects. Keep in touch with people you meet. </LI>

<H3>Organic Agriculture and Gardening: Soil, Seeds and
Sustainability</H3>
<HR><P><I>&quot;Eating is a political and agriculture act.
The food choices we make each day affect the way that
agriculture operates. Each choice can be considered a vote,
either for the status quo of chemically based conventional
agricultural or for a shift to ecologically based organic
agriculture.&quot;</I></P>
<P><B>Wendell Berry, author/farmer</B></P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<H4>Our health and the health of our beautiful planet</H4>
<P><I>The GreenMoney Journal</I> believes in and supports
individuals who desire to link their hearts, values,
resources, and lives.</P>
<P>With this issue we tie our health to the health of our
beautiful planet. After much conversation and consideration
we have settled on an approach that has &quot;an edge.&quot; This edge is meant to point a finger at
the emergency existing in our current relationship with the
production of food -- our use of the land. We have come to
believe that we cannot both live fully AND poison our bodies
with devitalized food and our planet with chemicals. This is
a strong position that grows stronger with every detail we
uncover in the process of becoming informed. If we seem
biased, realize that we are. The loss of soil and
biodiversity sadly, sorrowfully, obviously, depletes the
earth's natural
abundance, and it scars the present and future delight and
potential of all people on the earth.</P>
<P><B>Since 1950:</B></P>
<UL><LI>world grain demand has tripled;</LI>
<LI>world seafood demand has quadrupled; and</LI>
<LI>world agriculture has tripled its use of
irrigation.</LI>
</UL>
<P><B>Currently:</B></P>
<UL><LI>grain output is lagging -- we have the smallest grain reserves in 50
years;</LI>
<LI>13 of 15 fisheries are declining; and</LI>
<LI>one fifteen million acre area in the U.S. has
groundwater levels declining from six inches to six feet per
year.</LI>
</UL>
<P>On both global and local community scales, food
production and its impacts are critical. We believe it is
possible, desirable, and urgent that we take control of the
food we produce, our health and the health of the earth. </P>

</CENTER><HR><H4>Don't Shop, Be Happy !</H4>
<P><I>A simpler way is a world we already know.  We may not have seen it clearly, but we have been living in it all our lives.  It is a world that is more welcoming, more hospitable to our humanness.  Who we are & what is best about us can more easily flourish.  It is life's invitation to freedom, creativity, and meaning that welcomes us back.  These are the desires of human existence.  Now we can see our reflection in the world.</I></P>
<P><CENTER><B>Margaret Wheatley & Myron Kellner-Rogers, A Simpler Way</B></CENTER></P> 
<P><BR></P>
<P>Have you explored the idea of voluntary simplicity? You may have found it difficult to define.</P>
<P>Marketing teams, in their drive to tell us how our world should look actively promote simpler sleeker things as being synonymous with success.  We pay twice for these tactics.  When we pay for the product; we also pay their salaries (approximately $162 billion in advertising annually).  Sleek things may be synonymous with efficient design, but not necessarily with your definition of success.</P>
<P>What is the hallmark of success? If a definition of elegance is "well chosen," then successful simplicity may be about a certain kind of elegance.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><I>Financial independence does not have to come from having more; it can come from              needing less.</I></P>
<P><CENTER><B>Donella Meadows, Author</B></CENTER></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>A non-material component of simplicity is purpose.  Do we have a purpose encompassing more than cash or credit?  Family, community, personal development are a few examples.  GreenMoney Journal ventures to suggest that simplicity is a conscious and intentional way of living which prioritizes inner fulfillment.</P>
<P>While your true purpose is yours to create, GreenMoney Journal can help prepare for the change.  We all need time to develop and experience our purpose(s).  With limited hours in a day you may find yourselves deciding between money or your "life."</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><I>Americans are not people with lives, but consumers with lifestyles.</I></P>
<P><CENTER><B>William McDonough, Architect</B></CENTER></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>By consuming less, how much can we reduce the amount of money we need to live?  How can we begin?   The following four keys can unlock the door to begin your journey.  The keys are:  <EM>Awareness, Practice, Support and Maintenance.</EM></P>

<H5>FIRST KEY: AWARENESS</H5>
<P>Become aware of the principles and resources of conscious consumerism.  The resources and lists throughout this issue will help.  Put simply: the act of being a consumer is simplified by supporting companies who follow ethical business practices, and withholding support from those who do not.  For in-depth guidance on the subject read <I>Shopping for a Better World</I> and <I>Shopping with a Conscience</I>.</P>
<P>As consumers we need to know not only where products are made, but that they are made free from forced labor and other human rights abuses.  Other countries may not have the general standards that exist in the U.S.  Even the U.S., however still has sweatshops.  What practices are we supporting with our consumer dollars?  Where is our clothing being manufactured?  Do the labels on our clothing and food honestly reflect the information we need?</P>
<P>GreenMoney can help you develop your personal screening criteria -- what are you willing to support and not willing to support.  It takes practice.</P>

<H5>SECOND KEY: PRACTICE</H5> 
<P>Select a product or service and investigate.  Ask:</P>
<UL><LI>is the product heavily packaged, non-recyclable, non-biodegradable leading to unnecessary waste that fills our already overflowing landfills?</LI>
<LI>is the products made locally?  Transporting products require energy and creates pollution.</LI>
<LI>is the product made by a environmentally innovative small business?</LI>
<LI>what is the product's life-cycle?  What is it made from, it usefulness, and its post use?  Note: Germany is pushing for "take back" laws that require manufacturers of durable goods to take back the product when the consumer is finished.</LI>
<LI>does the company use an efficient manufacturing process, using recycled & recycable materials?</LI>
<LI>how much and to whom does the company donate goods, services or money?</LI>
<LI>does the company use organically grown and sustainably harvested natural materials, such as organic cotton?</LI>
<LI>where are the products made and by who?  Does the company use fair labor practices?  (say <B>NO</B> to sweatshops).  Companies like Levis, Reebok, Sears, Gap, and now Nike are screening suppliers (and factories) using codes of conduct as well as "independent monitoring"  and "third party inspections."</LI></UL>

<P><B>Consumer Activism /Boycotts:</B></P>
<P>Part of shopping is the ability to vote with your consumer dollars.  If you don't want to financially support a company you should know what products they produce.</P>
<P>Two major issues in marketplace today are: products manufactured in Burma, and food products made by tobacco companies.  Many well-known food companies are owned by tobacco companies.  This ownership is not reflected on the product labels.  If you don't want to support tobacco companies profits, the INFACT organization's "Tobacco Industry Campaign" has provided a complete list of the food companies owned by Philip Morris and RJR/Nabisco to boycott. (see the list below).  Here are some of the other product boycotts:</P>
<UL><LI>Burma -- the new South Africa?</LI></UL>
<P>When Levi Strauss pulled its operation out of Burma they stated "it is not possible to do business in Burma without supporting the military government and its pervasive violations of human rights."  Several companies including: Columbia Sportswear, Liz Claiborne, Eddie Bauer and Oshkosh B'Gosh have pulled their operations from and/or cut business ties with Burma.</P>
<P><B>Pepsi</B> is now boycotted worldwide for its continued business activities in Burma.  The company is still selling through a franchise agreement after selling its share in the local bottler.  Pepsi lost its contract at Harvard, and at Stanford students kept a Pepsi-owned Taco Bell from their campus.  
PepsiCo also owns Pizza Hut, KFC, Frito-Lay, Chee-tos, Lay's, Doritos, Rold Gold, Ruffles, All-Sport, Mug Root Beer, Slice, and Mountain Dew.</P>  
<P>Other Boycotts:</P> 
<UL><LI>Nestle products - Nestle, MJB Foods, Stouffer's, Lean Cuisine, Hills Brothers, Taster's Choice, Libby's, Perrier, Calistoga, Poland Springs, Dreyers Ice Cream, Carnation, L'oreal, Arrowhead, Juicy Juice, Alpo, and Friskies.</LI>
<LI>American Home Products - Advil, Anacin, AH Robbins, Dimetapp, Robitussin, Dristan, Centrum, Chap Stik, Denorex, Dennison's Chili, Golden Mustard, PAM Spray, and Jiffy Pop.</LI></UL>

<P><B>TOBACCO COMPANY OWNED FOOD PRODUCTS BOYCOTT</B></P>
<P>PHILIP MORRIS brands and products include:</P> 
<UL><LI>Kraft, Post &amp; Nabisco Cereals, General Foods, Lender's Bagels, Kool-Aid, Capri Sun, Country Time drink mixes, Crystal Light, Stove Top Stuffing, Maxwell House Coffee, Yuban Coffee, Jell-O, Louis Rich Meats, Oscar Mayer, Minute Rice, Tombstone Pizza, Bull's Eye BBQ sauce, Miracle Whip, Shake 'N Bake Coatings, Log Cabin &amp; Country Kitchen Syrups, Altoids Mints, Tobelerone           Chocolates, Cheez Whiz.</LI></UL>
<P>RJR/NABISCO brands & products include:<P>
<UL><LI>Nabisco, Planters, Breath Savers, Life Savers, Grey Poupon, Nabisco cookies &amp; crackers including Cheese Nips, Snackwell's, Wheat Thins, Newtons, etc.  CareFree, Blue Bonnet margarine, Fleischmann's margarine, A.1. Steak Sauce, Cream of Wheat, Milk Bone Pet Products, Egg Beaters.</LI></UL>

<P>As you continue to practice it's important to stay informed.</P>  
 
<P><B>THIRD KEY: SUPPORT - Stay informed</B></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><I>Quality of living is not the same as standard of living.</I></P>
<P><CENTER><B>Vicki Robin, Author</B></CENTER></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>Twenty-eight percent of Americans said that within the last five years they have made voluntary changes in their lives that had decreased their earnings, such as reducing work hours, switching to lower-paying jobs or quitting jobs to stay at home.   [Yearning for Balance Report].</P>
<P>It is estimated that 10% of the adults in America are <I>upshifting</I> -- pioneering a new way of life that is more sustainable, satisfying, and soulful.  They're making a whole-pattern shift in their lives towards growth, meaningful work, family life, community, and spiritual development.  The new frugality movement is characterized by low-consumption, high fulfillment lifestyles.</P>

<P>It's important to have good resources while maintaining a commitment.</P>

<P><B>FOURTH KEY: MAINTENANCE - Gotta shop ! Where to go,  for what?</B></P>
<P>Brave a change and integrate the Holiday season with voluntary simplicity.  Look carefully at how you spend.  What do you buy, and why?  Look at both products and services.  Buy carefully what you need and very carefully what you want.  The more you understand about how you spend -- the more        conscious you will grow as a consumer.</P>
<P>This can be very hard with the media telling us how the holidays should be.  Altering expectations with 12 million catalogs delivered a year is a tall order.  There is hope, and hope is the root of holiday traditions and celebrations.  Remember: rush less, buy less, enjoy more.</P>
<P>The Methodists recently came up with the Hundred dollar holiday.  People are urged to spend no more than a hundred dollars per family on presents, and to emphasis homemade gifts (bread, jam) or invisible gifts (back rubs, wood-stacking).</P>

<P><B>HOLIDAY GIFT IDEAS:</B></P> 
<P>organic cotton sweatshirt, gift basket of organic foods, a backpack, a bike, 
non-violent children toys, a compost box, gift memberships to progressive organization, 
gift subscription to a favorite publication</P>

<P><B>The Products -</B></P>
<P>Responsible companies weve listed look beyond their bottom line to the impact they make on their customers, their workers, their communities and their planet.  The following list 
of companies and products were researched by <I>Shopping for a Better World (1994), Shopping with a Conscience (1996)</I>, and several screened mutual funds.</P>

<P><BR></P> 

<P><I>Voluntary simplicity involves both inner and outer condition.  It means singleness of purpose, sincerity and honesty within, as well as avoidance of exterior clutter, of many possessions irrelevant to the chief purpose of life.  It means an ordering and guiding of our energy and our desires, a partial restraint in some directions in order to secure greater abundance of life in other directions.  It involves a deliberate organization of life for a purpose.</I></P>

<H3>A Deeper Shade of Green (Non) Consuming</H3>
<H4>by Vicki Robin, co-author of <I>Your Money or Your Life</I></H4>
<P>1.  Do you plant trees, carpool and recycle?</P>
<P>2.  Do you precycle, buying products unadorned by plastic and cardboard packaging which you'd only have to throw away?</P>
<P>3.  Do you "shop for a better world" by purchasing products from socially responsible companies?</P>
<P>Congratulations!  You are a good green consumer -- but these practices alone are no longer good enough.  Green consuming is still consuming.  Finding ways to not consume now constitutes the front lines of the environmental revolution.  Green, which used to mean Go, is now the signal to Stop.</P>
<P>Let me explain.  By now we all know that we must "save the planet" - literally; we must conserve our resource base, which is the planet.  Over consumption in North America is implicated in almost every environmental and social problem we face, from species extinctions to ozone holes to the loss of a sense of community.  We must stop polluting, stop cutting down the forest, stop unnecessary burning of fossil fuels.  And this means we must stop shopping to fill our time, satisfy our needs for admiration and affection and maintain our relationships with other people.</P>
<P>We'd all like to cooperate with this lofty agenda, but business, government and advertising have educated us for almost a century to be consumers.  Our wants and whims are now experienced as needs and, like addicts, we can't seem to stop.  So our lives are spent working to pay the bills while our children go to day care and our marriages go to pot.</P>
<P>Where is the solution we can live with?  Must we now tighten our belts?  Do without?  Make do?  Kiss our comforts good-bye?  No.  There is, indeed, a kinder and gentler solution to our "overgrazing" the earth's resources in our endless search for greener pastures.  It's knowing when enough is enough.</P>
<P>What if, for every purchase, we were to ask ourselves, "Will this item bring me fulfillment in proportion to the amount of my life-energy I spent to get it?"  If you earn $10/hour take-home pay, a silk blouse could cost you a day of your life.  If you wear it often and wear it out, it could be worth it.  But if it hangs in your closet, too delicate to wear, its fulfillment quotient is pretty low.  Survey your current possessions.  How many stand up to the fulfillment test?  Our garages, closets, attics and basements are full of unused or under-used clutter that brings us no pleasure and actually costs us money to store and insure.  All these things represent wasted hours of our lives and wasted global resources.  Every dollar wasted represents one pint of oil unnecessarily extracted and burned -- i.e., the energy it took to turn a piece of the planet into a piece of junk in your basement.  Have a garage sale.  Share the wealth.  Cut back to having only what brings you fulfillme
nt, and nothing more.  You will soon reach that magic point of "enough."</P>
<P>Why is it that belt-tightening is a victory for dieters but anathema for shoppers?  Why do we worship thin bodies and fat wallets?  Why is it that we express ourselves by what we buy and what we have, rather than by who we are and what we give?  Perhaps if we were to cut our consumption down to what really serves us -- what is enough, but no more -- we would end up not deprived but fiscally fit.</P>
<P>What will it take for America to lead the way into a sustainable future?  It will take bringing discussions of money and consumption out of the closet.  It will take active dialogue and debate about how much is enough.  It will take debunking cherished myths like "more is better" and "an even higher standard of living equals an even higher quality of life."  And it will take legions of courageous and honest people willing to define what is enough for them, and then stop shopping long enough to coach the Little League, go fishing or volunteer in the community.  As you become more a producer of happiness for others and less a consumer of stuff, the better off we will all be.  And that folks, is the deeper shade of green non consuming.</P>

<H3>Green Organization Profile</H3>
<HR><H4>EARTHSAVE</H4>

<P><I>People are moving away from consumption to connection -- with ourselves, with each other, and with the world.</I></P>
<P><CENTER><B>John Robbins, Founder & Author</B></CENTER></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>EarthSave International is an organization that let's you know how your food choices can have global results.</P>
<P>EarthSave helps create a better world by showing the powerful impacts of our ordinary eating habits and promoting positive alternatives.  The organization educates people about the dietary link to environmental degradation, encourages sound nutrition, conservation of natural resources and sustainable agriculture.  They show how an animal-based diet, and the factory farming which underlies it, causes enormous depletion and pollution of the natural world, suffering for animals, and danger to our own health.</P>
<P>EarthSave's team researches, produces and distributes educational materials, participates in local, national and international conferences, creates visibility in the media and creates alliances with other health and environmental organizations.</P>  
<P>John Robbins, founder of EarthSave and former heir to the Baskin-Robbin ice cream empire, has even taken the message to the United Nations where he received a standing ovation for his vision and work.</P>  
<P>To help spread the message, long-time vegetarians Paul and Linda McCartney recently joined the organization's Board of Advisors.</P>  
<P>John Robbins wrote his first book, <I>Diet for a New America</I> in 1987.  The book and recent video seek to raise public consciousness and encourage people to change through honest, accurate information about the meat industry and its effects on our health.  Plant-based food choices and life-affirming behavior underlie EarthSave's message.</P>
<P>Mad cow disease, bovine growth hormone, e. Coli, factory farms/slaughterhouses, animal abuse, and feeding slaughtered parts of cows to other cows comprise the reality in our meat and dairy-based society.</P>  
<P><B>The facts are extreme -</B></P> 
<UL><LI>each one pound of hamburger requires twelve pounds of grain, 2,500 gallons of water and one gallon of gas.  The same resources could grow fifty pounds of fruits and vegetables and eight loaves of bread.</LI>
<LI>one half of all the water in the U.S. grows feed and provides drinking water for cattle and other livestock.</LI>
<LI>cattle consume 70% of all U.S. grain production.</LI>
<LI>one third of all fish caught in the world are turned into fishmeal and fed to livestock.</LI>
<LI>advertising budget for "Beef, it's what for dinner" is $40 million.</LI></UL>
<P><B>On a more positive note -</B></P>
<UL><LI>overall meat consumption is down.</LI>
<LI>vegetarian burgers are options at McDonald's in England and in India.</LI>
<LI>garden burgers are now being sold in over 500 Subway shops.</LI> 
<LI>Ironman Triathlon six-time winner Dave Scott is a vegetarian.</LI>
<LI>The next Great American Meatout is March 20, 1997.  For more information call 800-meatout.</LI></UL>
<P><BR></P>
<P><I>I think for people to draw the line in a way that's consistent with their own values, they need to be aware of how the animals are actually treated, so that they can make informed choices.</I></P>     
<P><CENTER><B>John Robbins, Founder & Author</B></CENTER></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>EarthSave also has a Healthy School Lunch Program which includes an action guide and "Healthy Children, Healthy Planet" curriculum.  EarthSave believes that plant-based meals should become an option in the 96,000 U.S. public schools that are serving 26 million meals daily to students.  The mission is to "educate students, teachers, food service personnel, school administrators and many other concerned individuals about health, environmental and economic benefits of a low-fat plant-based diet.  The Healthy School Lunch Program aims to inspire a nation of youth to take responsibility for the Earth's well-being by making choices and taking actions that promote personal and global health."</P>
<P>The Healthy Children, Healthy Planet Curriculum offers lesson plans, visual aids, games, exercises & teacher information.  </P>
<P>In 1995, EarthSave distributed 8,500 <I>Diet for a New America</I> videos free to schools around the country.</P>
<P>The other school program includes: YES! Youth for Environmental Sanity, a traveling group of young people who give presentations and workshops to schools and community events about young people making a difference and getting involved in the global youth environmental movement.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><I>We know that a meat-based diet is the cause of serious long-term health consequences, including much greater risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, osteoporosis, and arthritis.  Meat production contributes to environmental degradation, in part because it uses more land, water and fossil fuels than plant-based alternatives.  A meat-based diet also contributes to world hunger; if Americans reduced their meat consumption by 10 percent, enough grain would be saved to feed 60 million people.</I></P>
<P><CENTER><B>Carol Sue Hunting, EarthSave Seattle</B></CENTER></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>John Robbins' new book is Reclaiming Our Health.  This important ground-breaking book shines a spotlight on the ineffectiveness of today's health care (disease-care) industry structure, the medical establishment's greed and their political domination.  It also lets us know about the future of medicine and how we must take part in our true healing.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><I>The average U.S. physician, in four years of medical school, gets only two hours of course work in nutrition.  Only 25 percent of the accredited medical schools in the country have a single required course in nutrition.  Meanwhile, McDonald's is opening up franchises in hospitals.</I></P>

<H3>INVESTING THOUGHT</H3>
<H4>by Tom Kliewer, Co-Editor</H4>

<P>Recently, I ran into a woman I went to public school with.  She and her family were in the process of moving to the country.  They had made the land purchase, sold their home, and were having an absolutely miserable time actually getting out there.  All hell broke loose when they started to unload their old life and build a new one.  These are not foolish people, they are, in fact, "wise" and considerate people.  As she told me how it was for them I had to agree that the changes we were making in my family were equally rough.  I wondered if there was a name for the chaos that erupted when we took action toward our version of <B>voluntary simplification</B>.  The process is anything but simple.  Even without a name for it there is a value in sharing that change which can awaken sleeping giants -- of all description.</P>
<P>Our list of awakened giants includes bad titles to property we purchased, unforeseen changes in income, the usual modern natural disasters: auto trouble, illness, and bouts of "retail therapy"...(furniture we don't need, clothes we can't store, etc.), and neighbor trouble added to the run of the mill modern life/family "one thing after another" continuum.</P>
<P>What we have learned -- not through brilliance but absolute accident -- is that parts of change are fast, and some are very slow.  For example: the bank can take your land purchase money in three minutes.  That is fast.  A house remodel can take ten years.  That's slow.  A fast timeline does no favors to a family in the process of simplification.</P>
<P>We are moving to a smaller house in a smaller community farther from a major city.  We are looking forward to smaller schools for our daughter.  We are not looking forward to smaller grocery stores.  These assumptive preparations are fantasy.  We, in fact, know nothing about what our life will be when we find ourselves making dinner and sleeping in the little white house on the edge of the small town.  We are learning that easy does do it (coffee is not always a good idea) and "taking our time" is good.  We can try to foresee what will happen, but we cannot (and don't want to) know it before we live ourselves into it.</P>
<P>I don't know what all this means.  We spend time in that small town as we do the work it takes to change.  We attend the fourth of July parade, and the town play ...  we watch the rodeo and the sunset ...  we talk to people at the local hardware store, and we hope.  We hope that leaving a comfortable, complicated city life for a comfortable, complicated country life will suit us and our growth.  We hope for more time together and more time outside.  We hope the dogs will like it ...  and the cats will choose to stay.  We have hearts full of hope, but we don't really know.  We have each other and our commitment...</P>
<P>I will keep you posted.</P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>GreenMoney <B>is not</B> in the business of offering buy, sell or hold recommendations to investors.  Nor is this a list of companies with unblemished social records.  There is no such thing as sainthood in the corporate world.  The purpose of this directory is to identify Web sites maintained by or featuring publicly-owned companies that are followed by some investors, stock analysts, and portfolio managers who specialize in Socially Responsible Investing (SRI).  It is also designed to illustrate the many different types of social issues that are of interest to those in the SRI movement.<P>

Some company web sites contain information about the latest stock price quotes as noted below.  For others, you can find stock ticker symbols and get the stock price quotes at <a href="http://www.paradise.net/paradise/stocks/index.html">Internet Paradise's Stocks &amp Money</a> page.</P>

<LI><B><A href="http://www.pge.com">Pacific Gas &amp Electric</A></B> This electric utility has been controversial because of its operation of the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant.

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML STRICT LEVEL 2//EN"><HTML VERSION="-//IETF//DTD HTML STRICT LEVEL 2//EN"><HEAD><TITLE>GMJ:  The Renaissance of Values (in the Marketplace) </TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<img src = "/greenbar.gif" alt = "The GreenMoney On-Line Guide">
<H3>THE RENAISSANCE OF VALUES (IN THE MARKETPLACE) </H3>
<P>The Renaissance promoted the belief that each person was free, capable of fashioning their own destiny. Each person was seen to be of value, at least in theory. If this belief had been integrated by all we would not have the true need for movements to establish equal rights... yet the idea did not fail if we strive today for that equality, to realize the values first embraced in principle during the Renaissance. Like any good idea, it did not fail, but waited its time.</P>
<P>The GreenMoney Journal seeks to further the possibilities of this principle by valuing each person, the environment, society, and commerce in sustainable balance. Making an impact as a individual is where it begins. That responsibility spreads outward to the many communities we touch. Informed financial decisions <B>are</B> the power of the responsible consumer. A recent poll by the Walker Research reflects how consumers feel:</P>
<UL>
<LI>78% of all consumers are currently avoiding or refusing to buy from certain businesses because of negative perceptions about them. These include both organized boycotts and individual refusals to buy. Of that number, 48% said that unethical or unlawful business practices play a significant role in determining their decisions. </LI>
<LI>47% indicated they would be much more likely to buy from a company that is socially responsible and a good corporate citizen if the quality, service, and price were equal to that of competitors. </LI>
<LI>A growing group -16 % - said they actively seek information about a company's business practices before purchasing. </LI>
</UL>
<P>How do we recognize stores and products that pass our social screens? How are companies addressing quality of life issues such as air, water, environment, education, and common good? To answer these questions read publications such as Co-op America's National Green Pages and Shopping for a Better World (See resource list on page 8).</P>
<P>Consumers impact company behaviors in two ways: by buying, or not buying, their products, and by telling them our reasoning. Shop responsibly and support responsible companies.</P>
<P>We are approaching the season of <B>over-consumption</B>. The daily avalanche of holiday catalogs began in late August. Why? The average American family spends about $400 on holiday gifts. The U.S. retail sales for month of December totaled $156 billion in 1991 and $169 billion in 1992. When the holidays close, advertisers will have spent one billion dollars to get our attention.</P>
<P>Carefully consider product packaging. An American family of four recycles 1,100 pounds of aluminum cans, glass containers, plastic bottles, steel cans, newspapers, and cardboard annually. The same family discards an estimated 5,300 pounds of poorly selected and designed packaging materials and other waste in the same time period. That's a 5 to 1 ratio pointing in the wrong direction. The U.S. leads the world in waste production, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), generating 200 million tons a year. Each of us discards 3.6 pounds a day, almost twice as much as the average German citizen. </P>
<H4>Shopping for a Better World 1994 </H4>
<P>The next time you're checking out a product's quality, price, and recyclability, check also the social performance of the company behind the product, and turn your shopping cart into a vehicle for social change.</P>
<P>How much do you know about the companies you support with your dollars? Do these companies pour toxic materials into our rivers and atmosphere? Do these companies invest in pollution prevention, donate significant portions of its profits to charity, revitalize local communities, and value the expertise of women and minorities at the highest levels of management?</P>
<P><I>Shopping for a Better World 1994 </I> (Sierra Club Books, 1994) provides the information you need to select products made by companies whose policies and practices you support. Not only can you find out what company makes your favorite products but you can also see the parent company's social record at a glance.</P>
<P>The Council on Economic Priorities (CEP), writers of <I>Shopping for a Better World </I> (SFBW) have two significant goals: to inform and educate the American public <B>and</B> to provide incentives for corporations to be good citizens, responsive to the environment and to the social concerns of all their stakeholders: employees, neighbors, investors, and consumers.</P>
<P>This best-selling guide on socially responsible shopping has been revised and expanded to include evaluations of 200 companies and 2000 products on eight important areas of corporate responsibility. SFBW has established itself as the most popular and authoritative reference for those who realize the importance of rewarding companies whose policies affirm their concern for the environment, their employees, and their customers. </P>
<H4>The new features of the 1994 edition include:</H4>
<P><B>Grading of A through F for each company </B>on each of the following eight major areas of corporate responsibility: environmental performance, charitable giving, community outreach, advancement of women, advancement of minorities, family benefits, workplace issues, and disclosure of information.</P>
<P><B>Detailed explanations of the grading criteria is clearly outlined.</B> For example, companies are evaluated in 13 areas of corporate environmental performance, including toxic releases, use of recycled packaging materials, energy conservation, community, and compliance to environmental statutes.</P>
<P><B>An "Extras" section listing additional information </B>about a company's stance on other social issues such as animal testing, foreign ownership, conventional and nuclear weapons work, worker benefits and major product liability lawsuits.</P>
<P><B>Essays which outline the state of food, clothing, toy, automobile, appliance, computer, and telecommunications industries </B>and what questions consumers should be prepared to ask.</P>
<P><B>Expanded profiles of the 20 companies on CEP's Honor Roll </B>and the eight companies whose poor ratings earned a place on the X-Rated list, and an address list so you can communicate with the companies. Some of the Honor Roll companies: Aveda Corp., Ben &amp; Jerry's, Dayton Hudson, General Mills, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kellogg Co., Nordstrom, Tom's of Maine, Colgate-Palmolive, Digital Equipment, Hewlett Packard, SC Johnson &amp; Co., Levi Strauss.</P>
<H4>Five steps for integrity in the marketplace</H4>
<P>1. Try<B> direct purchasing</B>. Buy from Church bazaars, Third World craft organizations, local crafts people, and nonprofit agencies.<BR>2. Have recycling goals. <B>Cut down</B> on overpackaged purchases. Buy <B>bulk items</B>. Recycle everything possible. <B>Create markets</B> by purchasing products with high recycled material content. <BR>3. If you <B>send cards</B> this season make them yourself, or buy <B>high recycled paper content </B>cards. Buy cards from the Sierra Club, National Wildlife Federation or local artists.<BR>4. <B>Save paper and call </B> your friends and family using Working Assets Long Distance and have your voice heard twice.

<img src = "/greenbar.gif" alt = "The GreenMoney On-Line Guide">
<H3>A DEEPER SHADE OF GREEN (NON) CONSUMING</H3>
<P>by Vicki Robin, co-author of <I>Your Money or Your Life</I></P>
<P></P>
<P>1. Do you plant trees, carpool and recycle?<BR>2. Do you precycle, buying products unadorned by plastic and cardboard packaging which you'd only have to throw away?<BR>3. Do you "shop for a better world" by purchasing products from socially responsible companies?</P>
<P><B>Congratulations!</B> You are a good green consumer -- but these practices alone are no longer good enough. Green consuming is still consuming. Finding ways to not consume now constitutes the front lines of the environmental revolution. Green, which used to mean <B>Go</B>, is now the signal to <B>Stop</B>.</P>
<P>Let me explain. By now we all know that we must &amp; quot;save the planet" - literally; we must conserve our resource base, which is the planet. Over consumption in North America is implicated in almost every environmental and social problem we face, from species extinctions to ozone holes to the loss of a sense of community. We must stop polluting, stop cutting down the forest, stop unnecessary burning of fossil fuels. And this means we must stop shopping to fill our time, satisfy our needs for admiration and affection and maintain our relationships with other people.</P>
<P>We'd all like to cooperate with this lofty agenda, but business, government and advertising have educated us for almost a century to be consumers. Our wants and whims are now experienced as needs and, like addicts, we can't seem to stop. So our lives are spent working to pay the bills while our children go to day care and our marriages go to pot.</P>
<P>Where is the solution we can live with? Must we now tighten our belts? Do without? Make do? Kiss our comforts good-bye? No. There is, indeed, a kinder and gentler solution to our "overgrazing" the earth's resources in our endless search for greener pastures. It's knowing when enough is enough.</P>
<P>What if, for every purchase, we were to ask ourselves, "Will this item bring me fulfillment in proportion to the amount of my life-energy I spent to get it?" If you earn $10/hour take-home pay, a silk blouse could cost you a day of your life. If you wear it often and wear it out, it could be worth it. But if it hangs in your closet, too delicate to wear, its fulfillment quotient is pretty low. Survey your current possessions. How many stand up to the fulfillment test? Our garages, closets, attics and basements are full of unused or under-used clutter that brings us no pleasure and actually costs us money to store and insure. All these things represent wasted hours of our lives and wasted global resources. Every dollar wasted represents one pint of oil unnecessarily extracted and burned - i.e., the energy it took to turn a piece of the planet into a piece of junk in your basement. Have a garage sale. Share the wealth. Cut back to having only what brings you fulfillment, and nothing more. You will soon reach that magic point of "enough."</P>
<P>Why is it that belt-tightening is a victory for dieters but anathema for shoppers? Why do we worship thin bodies and fat wallets? Why is it that we express ourselves by what we buy and what we have, rather than by who we are and what we give? Perhaps if we were to cut our consumption down to what really serves us, what is enough, but no more, we would end up not deprived but fiscally fit.</P>
<P>What will it take for America to lead the way into a sustainable future? It will take bringing discussions of money and consumption out of the closet. It will take active dialogue and debate about how much is enough. It will take debunking cherished myths like "more is better" and "an even higher standard of living equals an even higher quality of life." And it will take legions of courageous and honest people willing to define what is enough for them, and then stop shopping long enough to coach the Little League, go fishing or volunteer in the community. As you become more a producer of happiness for others and less a consumer of stuff, the better off we will all be. And that folks, is the deeper shade of green non consuming.</P>

<H3>THE GREEN SUPERMARKET SHOPPING GUIDE </H3>
<P>by John Wasik (Warner Books, 1993)</P>
<P></P>
<P>As Noel Brown, Director of the UN Environmental Programme said "the marketplace is about values in transaction. The role of the marketplace is to be an instrument of environmental change and policy making. We are all consumers with a great potential for change. Environmental protection begins at home."</P>
<P>Vote with your dollars. Use the power of information to make informed purchasing decisions that reflect your values. The information must be accurate and reliable on issues of social and environmental responsibility.</P>
<P>In that spirit, The Green Supermarket Shopping Guide (Warner Books, 1993) will empower you to buy what you need to protect your family and our earth... and save you money. Author John Wasik, publisher of The Green Resource Guide and chairman of The New Consumer Institute, spent three years uncovering critical information on green products and marketing. Benefit from his effort.</P>
<P>The Green Supermarket Guide rates over 200 consumer goods manufacturers, 2000 products and 100 large supermarket chains. The resource section provides addresses and telephone numbers of the manufacturers and stores so you can communicate with them about their products and services. The book lists Green organizations, hotline numbers, publications and a glossary. It includes a practical list of fifty ways to be a Green Shopper.</P>
<P>The book uses a EFACT Rating system (Environmental and Financial Action Transformation) criteria, scoring companies on these areas: Environmental policy statements, Environmental management action, Environmental management programs and investments, Energy efficiency programs, Corporate responsibility and citizenship, Socially enhancing factors, CERES Principles signatory, Quality product and consumer information. Some top rated companies: Ben &amp; Jerry's, Celestial Seasonings, Merck and General Mills. Some <U>bottom </U> rated companies: Philip Morris, Nestle's, RJR/ Nabisco, and American Home Products (makers of Dristan, Anacin and Advil).</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>"The great strength of The Green Supermarket Shopping Guide lies in its straightforward assessment of some of the most complex questions facing responsible consumers. Not only consumers, but socially responsible investors will find this an invaluable resource" (Amy Domini, co-author of Investing for Good)</P>

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML STRICT LEVEL 2//EN"><HTML VERSION="-//IETF//DTD HTML STRICT LEVEL 2//EN"><HEAD><TITLE>GMJ Profile: Blue Fish Clothing Company</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>

<H3>BLUE FISH CLOTHING COMPANY</H3>

<P>One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, BLUE FISH. What do Dr. Suess and Jennifer Barclay have in common? Both have independently decided that a Blue Fish is a good thing...however Jennifer's Blue Fish was really orange, and in listening to her talk I realized that Blue Fish can really be any color at all - it's all up to our own imagination, perspective and desire.</P>

<P>	Not only does she like it that way, but her belief that it can be that way has taken her company from a blue (orange?) van at craft fairs to a company whose sales reached eight million dollars in 1995. In a chat with her at the recent Bioneers / Organic Agriculture Conference in San Francisco, (which Blue Fish helped sponsor) we had the opportunity to ask her about her company, her direction, and why she felt Blue Fish has attracted the devotees it has.</P>

<P>	Founded in 1984, the company is headquartered in Frenchtown, New Jersey. The flagship store is also in Frenchtown. There are other stores in Taos and Santa Fe, New Mexico. The creation is a line of women's and children's clothing and home accessories that are hand blocked-printed by a team of 25 studio artists. Each piece is an original and stamped with the moniker of the artist who created it. The collection is in comfy cotton, and beginning with the Fall 1995 line the company switched to all organic cotton. "The more I became educated about the heavy pesticide use in cotton farming, I knew I couldn't keep growing this company and polluting," explained Jennifer. A substantial part of Blue Fish's mission, and hence its story, is to "inspire people to make different lifestyle choices....and to educate people to support the Earth and the wellness of themselves." Although the mass market is not yet educated about the cotton-pesticide connection, Blue Fish hopes it will play a part by imparting the message to their customers.</P>

<P>	Blue Fish is a successful and growing business. Jennifer's vision and philosophy for the company and its 170 employees however, sounds more like heartfelt community-building than traditional business. "There is no separation between work and life. We spend our lives at work, we might as well really enjoy what we do and who we work with, and that's all I've really wanted&#150; just that." Early Blue Fish experience proved to her that things that look impossible are not always so. At the company, people have defined where they can best use their skills, and often design their own jobs and titles. Titles like "Dreams and Beliefs" (Jennifer Barclay, President and Founder), "Seeking and Guidance," "Dreams to </P>

<P>Reality," and "Spiritkeeper." With an organic and energy-flowing workplace the right people have "shown up," and employees continue to grow within a supportive and connected environment.</P>

<P>	Blue Fish's growth has the company looking for a larger manufacturing-office space. Jennifer envisions that the future workspace will also encompass an organic foods cafe and wellness center to further encourage the taking care of oneself within the circle. </P>

<P>	The success of Blue Fish has also allowed her to give back to her community. Indeed, the company's philosophy includes a commitment to social responsibility, and in 1994 the company contributed over $29,000 in cash, resources and products as well as participating in local events. The company intends to donate up to 10% of its net income in future years.</P>

<P>	BlueFishgarten is a traveling creativity and arts program for kids focused on poetry and painting. It has been created in response to the massive cutbacks in arts education in the schools today. "I can't imagine what I'd be doing if I hadn't had art class," comments Jennifer pensively. This program is produced by company employees on company time. </P>

<P>	Recently, Jennifer was named "1995 Citizen of the Year" in Frenchtown, New Jersey. </P>

<P>	Who wears Blue Fish? A query at a Nordstrom store indicated that the line moves very quickly. The clothing was well positioned at the front of the department, and the colors and fabric compels one to touch, and smile at the designs. A warning - the clothing is not inexpensive, especially if you want to achieve the multilayer look that Jennifer does so well. In 1996, Blue Fish will add a moderately-priced line of clothing to inspire a larger market, or for mixing it up with the original designs. </P>

<P>	For women like me who broke into business in the late '70s wearing the nondescript suit with that miserable floppy bow tie, Blue Fish represents freedom. And, perhaps, in a way it symbolizes the shift we are looking for in our lives. The shift from the constricting "business as usual" uniform with all the unspoken boundaries paying homage to the bottom line of profitability; to a creative process that cocoons people, personalities, dreams and life&#150; makes money, and doesn't bind at the soul&#150; or the waist. </P>

<P>	There are several ways to participate in Blue Fish fun. Their clothing is available at a variety of retail locations or directly from the company through their personalized shopping service at (908) 996-7333. For a free copy of their latest catalog call (908) 996-3844. </P>

<P>	The company is also in the subscription process of their Direct Public Offering (selling stock in the company). You may request offering information directly from the company by calling (800) 308-2956. Note: This article is not an offer to sell, or an endorsement of the common stock offering of Blue Fish Clothing, Inc. The offer is made only by the prospectus. </P>

<CENTER><H3>THE WORLD OF RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS</H3>
</CENTER><HR><H4>Time for Global Values, Part I</H4>
<P><I>As the number of companies embracing socially
responsible visions and values continue to grow, and the
links between their social performance, their impact on
stakeholders, and financial performance become more firmly
established, the overriding question will not be whether
companies should adopt these policies and practices, but
rather when, and how quickly, they should do so.</I></P>
<CENTER><P><B>Joel Makower, Beyond the Bottom Line</B></P>
</CENTER><P><BR>Worldwide conversations about business
include questions, such as:</P>
<UL><LI>Should global companies participate in the social
issues facing employees and community members of their
trading partners? Issues such as education, health care,
environmental degradation, fair wages, working conditions and
human rights? </LI>
<LI>Should businesses respect employees' as workers and
family members, contributing to the well-being and
productivity of these employees?</LI>
<LI>What are the responsibilities professional organizations
have to the communities they occupy (beyond member
interests)?</LI>
</UL>
<P>In the belief that if you have the right questions you
can find the right answers, we conclude that business has
survived it's dark age. Clear communication and right action
in the new world, however, requires a conclusive vantage
point (current information and indications of things to come)
to serve the welcome new comer and seasoned business
community member as well. This demand plus volumes of good
news generated by responsible business requires two
<B>GreenMoney Journal's</B> to cover thoroughly. This GMJ
(Part I) highlights: company practices, current issues,
organizations, principles, women, and news from Washington,
D.C. Part II- Summer 1997 will highlight: Responsible
manufacturing and product design, the forthcoming book from
Paul Hawken with Amory and Hunter Lovins, responsible 401(k)
&amp; pension plans and more resources). </P>
<H4>STAKEHOLDER ISSUES: </H4>
<P><I>Global companies face a new set of issues that go well
beyond their traditional business focus. Corporations must
deal with global concerns about human rights, living wages
and safe working conditions, child and forced labor, the
environment and sustainable community development.</I></P>
<CENTER><P><B>David Schilling, ICCR's Global Corporate
Accountability Program</B></P>
</CENTER><P>How does business today meet the demands of all
the stakeholders? The term stakeholder includes: the company,
employees, customers, shareholders, community, business
partners/suppliers, global business and the environment. </P>
<P>In Part I, we look at four stakeholder positions: the
company, the employees, global business, and business
partners/suppliers. (In Part II- Summer 1997, the remaining
four).</P>
<P>The questions we ask about Companies:</P>
<UL><LI>How does the company handle its corporate openness,
citizenship, and accountability?</LI>
<LI>Where does the company advertise (radio/TV/publications)
and what events do they sponsor? </LI>
<LI>Does the company have corporate code of ethics,
principles, mission statement?</LI>
<LI>How does the company react to shareholder
resolutions?</LI>
<LI>What is the CEO's total compensation package? How our
the board members compensated?</LI>
<LI>Is the company a member of responsible business
organizations?</LI>
<LI>Is the company a CERES Principles (or other Principles)
signatory?</LI>
<LI>Does the company manufacture alcohol, tobacco or
weapons? </LI>
</UL>
<P>The questions we ask about about Employees:</P>
<UL><LI>Does the company have responsible workplace policies
and practices including non-discriminatory employment
practices and positive labor relations?</LI>
<LI>Does the company have woman and minorities in senior
management and on the board of directors?</LI>
<LI>Does the company have comprehensive health care &amp;
benefits packages for employees, domestic partners and their
families?</LI>
<LI>Does the company have on-site daycare,
employer-supported childcare center, eldercare?</LI>
<LI>Does the company offer a profit-sharing or gain-sharing
programs, stock purchasing plan or an ESOP- employees
ownership? </LI>
<LI>Does the company have flexible scheduling, flex time,
telecommuting, and job sharing available?</LI>
<LI>Does the company offer continuing education and training
programs for employees?</LI>
<LI>Doest he company have a socially &amp; environmentally
responsible investing 401(k) plan? </LI>
</UL>
<P>The questions we ask about about Global Business:</P>
<UL><LI>When will we realize we are all global
citizens?</LI>
<LI>Do our responsibilities extend beyond our immediate
community? </LI>
<LI>Does the company have a Global code of conduct on
working conditions and labor sourcing as well as human
rights?</LI>
<LI>Does the company have business activities in Burma,
Northern Ireland, Mexico, Nigeria, or China (countries with
identified responsible business issues)?</LI>
<LI>Does the company have effective policies and practices
addressing child labor, wages, workers health and
safety?</LI>
</UL>
<P>(The globalization issue is compounded by the tendency to
project regional values into other countries, and judge
practices in that way).</P>
<P>The questions we ask about Business
Partners/Suppliers:</P>
<UL><LI>Does the company have code of conduct, standards and
guidelines for all their suppliers, vendors and
subcontractors (worldwide)?</LI>
<LI>Does the company, its vendors or subcontractors use
child labor, forced or prison labor? </LI>
<LI>Does the company have supplier standards for products,
materials and labor sourcing?</LI>
<LI>Is the company purchasing socially &amp; environmentally
responsible products?</LI>
<LI>Is the company using women-owned, minority and
responsible vendors?</LI>

<H3>THE FUTURE OF RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS:</H3>
<H3>Corporate Responsibility: The Next Five Years</H3>
<H4>by Robert H. Dunn</H4>
<P>The year: 2002 The setting: Beijing</P>
<P>The occasion: the 12th Annual Conference of Business for
Social Responsibility (BSR), and the first such meeting held
in Asia.</P>
<P>The Keynote Speaker: the new democratically elected
President of the People's Republic of China.</P>
<P>Her topic: &quot;The Role of Private Enterprise in
Creating a More Just and Sustainable China.&quot;</P>
<P>Her audience: 1,000 executives from around the globe with
stories to tell about what their companies have done in the
past to demonstrate respect for workers, their families,
their communities and the environment.</P>
<P>The proceedings: Accessible to interested persons
throughout the world on their personal information and
entertainment consoles.</P>
<P>What's the likelihood that such a scenario will occur in
the next several years? Not very great.</P>
<P>In truth, it's a lot easier to speculate about what is
NOT likely to happen, than it is to predict with confidence
the near-term evolution of corporate social
responsibility.</P>
<P>This is true in part because of the uncertainty about
macro economic trends and world trade. It is also made more
difficult because any snapshot of the current state of
corporate citizenship reveals a picture with starkly
contrasting trends.</P>
<P>On the one hand, there is evidence of new green
initiatives, greater employee empowerment and new sensitivity
about worker and human rights.</P>
<P>On the other hand, there are gross examples of business
collaboration with government corruption, an excessive focus
on short-term profit taking and ongoing evidence of a
disregard for consumer health and safety.</P>
<P>Whether one or the other of these currents becomes the
mainstream of U.S. business behavior calls for a degree of
prognosticatory certitude I do not claim to possess.</P>
<P>With these appropriate disclaimers, let me offer up a
series of my own &quot;ten best guesses&quot; about what will
likely happen during the next few years.</P>
<P>First, I think there'll be real progress in forming a
consensus about the definition of corporate social
responsibility (CSR). While different people will continue to
view one element or another as being more important to them
personally, e.g., environment issues or the treatment of
workers; there will be a general acceptance that CSR is the
totality of corporate conduct that must be considered and
reformed.</P>
<P>Second, while there will continue to be companies that
are exemplary or leaders with respect to certain practices,
e.g., ethical codes or community service, no company will
hold itself out as being uniformly virtuous.</P>
<P>Third, there will be greater public expectations that
every company make a positive net contribution to the well
being of our society. There will be more information
available to the public about business conduct and more
sophisticated ways to measure the full costs and benefits of
products and services.</P>
<P>Fourth, there will also be new models being applied for
the allocation of these costs and benefits among companies,
their customers and the overall society.</P>
<P>Fifth, it will be increasingly commonplace for companies
to engage in social performance audits and use annual reports
(and other information vehicles) to address the full range of
business responsibility issues.</P>
<P>Sixth, concerns about the relationship between commerce
and environmental degradation will continue to be as
important as any other single issue, and there will be more
and more linkages between these issues and others, e.g.,
public health, community development and human rights.
Expectations will also remain high about the treatment of
employees, particularly with respect to discrimination, work
and family balance, professional development and downsizing
or restructuring.</P>
<P>Seventh, new scandals involving businesses and government
officials will focus attention on adherence to high ethical
standards as the best way to prevent corporate misdeeds.</P>
<P>Eighth, with the diminished role of government in the
U.S. and abroad, citizens will increasingly raise the stakes
for what they expect and require of socially responsible
companies.</P>
<P>Ninth, CSR will be supported by a broader coalition of
developed and developing countries, as the arguments are
discredited that these standards are attempts to impose
Western values or erect unfair trade barriers.</P>
<P>And Tenth, CSR will become common business practice as
the evidence mounts that well managed companies committed to
ethical and responsible practices consistently produce
greater returns for their investors and other
stakeholders.</P>
<P>So, there you have it. A set of predictions offered, with
due humility.</P>
<P>Be kind, gentle reader; and if you're willing to offer
your own ten predictions, I'd be delighted to have them. </P>

<H3>BUSINESS AND TOXIC MEDIA</H3>
<H4>by Kevin Lynch</H4>
<P>Much attention is given these days to the subject of
media violence. In my opinion, this discussion is too narrow.
We need to expand it.</P>
<P>Progressive social thought recognizes that media, and the
advertising that supports it, is an inherently dangerous
force. It drives unsustainable levels of consumption. It
implants poisonous messages of violence, greed, cynicism,
objectification and sexism. It hypnotizes the mind, exploits
the psyche and enslaves the spirit.</P>
<P>We need a new phraseology to replace the relatively
narrow scope of &quot;media violence.&quot; I prefer
&quot;toxic media.&quot;</P>
<P>Discussions of toxic media often focus on the role of
parents, schools, social services and the government in
protecting our children and communities. Real reform,
however, needs to begin with business.</P>
<P>As the owner of an advertising agency, I can definitively
say that media is a business transaction, pure and simple. It
exists for the sole purpose of attracting and selling
audiences to advertisers. Audiences are drawn to the
titillating power of &quot;jolt engines&quot; such as
violence, sex and shock. The more graphic the jolt, the more
susceptible the audience is to our commercial message. And so
in the quest to reach and sell to bigger better audiences, we
increase the RPM's every day.</P>
<P>Business has not squarely faced its responsibilities.
We've hidden behind the First Amendment. We've been afraid to
cede an audience, no matter how ill-obtained, to the
competition. And we've been short on the tools, in terms of
data or internal media literacy, to make informed choices
about toxic media content.</P>
<P>What can business do? Several things:</P>
<P>1. Demand content analysis of media.</P>
<P>2. Consciously decide to buy or not to buy certain
programming based on its toxic content, and specifically
communicate that choice to the media company.</P>
<P>3. Troubleshoot every commercial and advertisement to
avoid toxic messages.</P>
<P>4. Provide media literacy and critical viewing training
to media staffs and ad agencies.</P>
<P>5. Set written standards &amp; principles, and be held
accountable.</P>
<P>6. Set and communicate these same standards for
advertising firms and agencies.</P>
<P>7. Invest in vehicles and messages with positive net
impact.</P>
<P>There's big profit in the business transaction between
the media which entices an audience and the advertiser who
buys access to that audience. Until those of us who reap this
profit accept our responsibility for the toxicity of what we
put in the air, no real cleanup is possible.</P>
<HR><P>Kevin Lynch is CEO of Lynch Jarvis Jones, a
Minneapolis advertising agency which seeks to create positive
social change through the power of advertising and marketing.

<img src = "/greenbar.gif" alt = "The GreenMoney On-Line Guide">
<H3>TAKING TIME "ON" </H3>
<P>I took this past summer off. Not voluntarily, however. Late last year I was in a car accident while on my way to the airport for business, and as a result I have "post-traumatic fybro-myalgia," a chronic pain disorder with no known cure.</P>
<P>I have thought a lot about the expression "taking time off" and have come to realize that it is generally understood in the context of business. Taking time off means you don't go to work; as in not doing anything. In the context of life, I now consider this taking time "on." My usual routine was airports, rental cars, meetings, phone calls and eating at red lights. Very busy, but at the same time isolated from and often in contradiction to what I now consider life to be.</P>
<P>I spent the summer in gardens, studying native habitats, growing plants and observing birds. I also spent time with husband, friends &amp; our dog, Jake.</P>
<P>I have also been learning to live with my disorder, as a result I'm rearranging most aspects of my life. However, in its own pesky way it is teaching me time "off" is really time "on" - I just needed an attitude adjustment.</P>
<P>The standard vacation in America is two weeks. I have friends who vacation at home because they need to get caught up with their lives. How can we appreciate what we don't have time to experience? How can we steward our land (and ourselves!) if we don't have time to make the right choices? If we do "whatever it takes to get the job done" in business, have we considered the cost to our planet and ourselves to do it? What really is our job? More specifically, what truly should be our life's work?</P>
<P>Our garden is fabulous. Seeds saved from our favorite ear of red corn from last year has produced plants that are "out-growing" the other corn. We have also started some native plantings to attract birds. There is a National and Washington state program for certifying your yard as a "wildlife habitat." By returning part of our suburban "lawnscape" to habitat, birds and butterflies can return and flourish. Now that's taking life on.</P>

<H3>MAKING THE DIFFERENCE</H3>

<H4>by Mardelle Ceaser Feigenbaum</H4>

<P>	Since the focus of this issue is on social investing for financial reasons, I also want to share some insights and ideas on other investments that can have just as much impact. We are so pleased to be able to report some fine performance figures for 1995 as both an indicator and an assessment of the value social investing brings&#150; financial gain, economic justice, advancement for women and minorities in the corporate structure, safe and sane products for our homes and our lives. But as I really think hard about social investing and reflect on a holistic approach to integrating this belief into our lives, I am drawn to analogies of the plant world and gardening.</P>

<P>	 Winters are long in Spokane and St. Paul. Gardeners anxiously await Spring. I have been gardening in more moderate climates for most of my life, so I assembled a cadre of accouterments to help me be ready early - potting soils, spaghum moss, seed starter beds, seeds, and a gro-light. I wanted to make sure all my seeds (needing additional growing time) were well-established when Spring actually came. I followed directions carefully and hovered over my seed beds noticing every minutia of growth that occurred.</P>

<P>	However, something wasn't right. My sproutlings would shoot up, reaching for the gro-light with all their strength and then most of them would wither. I was crushed. Squash, corn, peppers, marigolds all had terrible mortality rates and I was saddened. Several did make it, and although there was some more attrition once in the garden we still had a nice crop. But I was very perplexed, and wanted to understand why a plant that reached for and welcomed the light did not survive.</P>

<P>	While researching over the summer I think I found my answer. Seedlings need to be warmed from the bottom even more than they need constant light from above. In fact, the seedlings were trying so hard to reach the light that without the warmth and support from the soil, where the roots were forming, the growth had little chance of being sustained and the plant sadly died, its energy expended before it could flourish.</P>

<P>	The same story happens to individuals, businesses and organizations that are also "reaching for the light." Without love, caring and support from people who believe in their mission they also are in danger of expending their energy and "burning out" before they are able to fulfill their dream, and contribute their peace to a better world. Roots are fragile until well established, and although you cannot "see" them right away, their care determine the plant's future. If they are strong the plant will have energy to deliver its message.</P>

<P>	Do you have a friend who is starting their own business? Do you know someone who believes in a cause, and works to support it? Has someone you care about shared a story with you? Is your community striving to be a safe and nurturing place to raise a family? As you look around your world, do you see "seedlings" that are establishing their roots?</P>

<P>	Even if you don't invest in the traditional sense, we are all stewards of our world. We have seen what happens when we stop paying attention to our dreams. I think we all know someone who has "burnt out," while reaching out.</P>

<P>	Make 1996 your year to be the heating pad for a seedling or two. Collectively we are all, making the difference.</P>

<H3>MAKING THE DIFFERENCE</H3>
<P>I have been familiar with the organic seed company Seeds of Change since 1990, when I grew their basil on my window ledge atop a home in the Oakland Hills. I do not remember exactly how I discovered Seeds of Change, but I was attracted to the organically raised seeds that had no exposure to pesticides. This relationship progressed to chilies grown in St. Paul, MN. and most recently, sunflowers and native corn grown in Spokane, WA.</P>
<P>When I admired their new book, <I>Seeds of Change: The Living Treasure</I> at a convention earlier this year; it was joyously presented to me as a gift. I began exploring the chapters. Not only did a sense of enchantment develop around the stories of the beginnings of <I>Seeds of Change </I> - but a vision emerged about sensory and nutritional rewards that grew from becoming part of the seed culture. Native ("traditional") open-pollinated species of plants that almost disappeared from the planet have been lovingly rediscovered, nurtured and stewarded by the gardeners at Seeds of Change as well as the loose connection of "seed savers" across the country.</P>
<P>Why is this enchantment so compelling? Can't I just go buy seeds at the store and grow corn? Yes...but not this corn. Seventy five percent of the native species have disappeared from the earth since the Middle Ages. The corn that is grown commercially today bears little resemblance to the traditionals. It is a hybrid, and will usually NOT reproduce true to form the next year the saved seeds are planted. These hybrids are developed and patented by a handful of multinational seed companies that often also own the companies that manufacture the pesticides and herbicides needed to successfully grow the corn. You end up having to go back to the store the next year to buy seeds again (as well as the chemicals). Do you begin to see the picture of dependency this creates?</P>
<P>Back to enchantment. Seeds of Change is the story of biodiversity and interdependency in nature. In the plant world, there are no kings, only mutual interdependency of nature including plants, animals, bacteria, and yes, humans. Linda Kapuler suggests the term "kindoms," to honor the beneficial dependency. For every plant species that become extinct, so will go the twenty to forty animal and insect species that depend on it. Biodiversity is the story of the plants, and the many species of each that can adapt to the different locations and climates and can grow in harmony with nature and without mass quantities of water, fertilizer and herbicides. </P>
<P>Biodiversity is disappearing from this planet at a alarming rate and is considered one of the top environmental threats by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</P>
<P>Their book is a beautiful story of biodiversity replete with history, recipes, photography and an invitation to become a "bioneer." Join me in the Spring/Summer 1995 issue to tackle some of the challenges we are facing, and a vision of a world where biodiversity is protected and restored in stewardship that begins in our own backyards.</P>
<P><I>Seeds of Change: The Living Treasure </I> - The passionate story of the growing movement to restore biodiversity and revolutionize the way we think about food by Kenny Ausubel (Harper San Francisco, 1994). To order the book or their 80-page organic seed catalog call:<BR>(505) 438-8080. </P>

<H3>INTEGRATIVE INVESTING</H3>

<HR>

<H4>Why Your Values Matter in the World of Money</H4>

<P>Whenever you make important decisions in your life, you act in accordance with your values and beliefs. Why would it be any different when making investment decisions?</P>

<P>Integrative Investing allows people to invest in a manner consistent with their values and beliefs concerning a variety of social and environmental issues. Another term used to describe this global movement is Socially Responsible Investing (SRI).</P>

<P>	When you invest in a socially and environmentally responsible mutual fund, you are putting your money to work towards a better world and a more just society. You are voicing an opinion for positive social change, while helping to make it happen. You also know your money isn't going to finance businesses engaged in poor social and environmental practices. You are helping to create a sound and sustainable future. Investing for profit with principles.</P>

<P>	The stock market moved up throughout 1995. Ten of the 41 socially responsible mutual funds returned more than 30%. The top fund was Citizens Trust Emerging Growth Fund with a total return of 40.7%. You can be ethical and make money. </P>

<P>	Information on SRI is now available around the world, 24-hours a day. The Internet's world wide web is an exciting new medium for the exchange of information. We stepped into this arena during 1995 by launching The GreenMoney Online Guide. The web site address is- http://www.greenmoney.com. </P>

<P>	As SRI continues to gain financial creditability and moves forward with conviction and commitment, it will increase its influence in the national and global conversation.</P>

<H4>SCREENS</H4>

<P>	Investment screening integrates your values and your money. The complexity of our world is reflected in the following questions. The choices you make reflect your values and beliefs. You can screen in the positive and screen out the company or activities you don't want to support. </P>

<P> 	Do you want to avoid certain companies because of their products and corporate behavior? Do you want to be involved in shareholder activism using shareholder resolutions to change corporate behavior? What is the composition of a company's Board of Directors&#150; do they represent a cross section of customers, community, employees, and shareholders? Is a company advertising in publications or on TV/Radio programs that you don't want to support? </P>

<P>	The list of social investing screens at the end of this srticle are used by screened mutual funds. For more information call any of the mutual funds listed on our performance chart and request a copy of their screening criteria. Also note the social ratings and definitions of mutual funds on page ten, which have been researched by Franklin Research and Development in Boston. </P>

<P>	Approximately half of the largest 1,000 publicly traded U.S. companies meet most socially responsible mutual funds screening criteria. The Domini 400 Social Index contains 250 companies from the Standard &amp; Poors 500 (S&amp;P 500). The new Citizens 300 Index contains 200 companies from the S&amp;P 500.</P>

<P> Are there performance sacrifices when investing in socially and environmentally responsible ways? No. Consider these numbers: The Domini 400 Social Index (DSI) was launched in May 1990 by Kinder, Lydenberg and Domini (KLD) to track 400 companies that pass multiple social screens. From May 1990 through December 1995, the DSI returned 135.5% compared to 120.5% for the S&amp;P 500. The DSI had its fifth anniversary last May. It demonstrated the long-term profitability of SRI, during the five-year period May 1, 1990 - April 30, 1995. Total return for the DSI was 92.64% vs. 81.13% for the S&amp;P 500.

<H4>The Future of Socially Responsible Investing</H4>

<P><B>by Carsten Henningsen, President of Progressive Securities </B></P>

<P>	During the next century, the largest transfer of wealth in our history will occur. As this happens, the demand for investments that speak to our deepest values and beliefs will continue capturing the fascination of people around the world. In record numbers, the baby-boomer generation will seek investments and investment management expertise directed toward corporate responsibility. </P>

<P>	According to a 1995 Bernstein Research report, "Wealthy households made up of those aged 65 or older own 32% of all the individual equities held by households." As this generation passes away, the equities will be stepped up in basis, and will be transferred to a generation attuned to professional money management. While the exact size and timing of the inheritance process is subject to debate, it is clear that the demographic trends are very favorable for select managers.</P>

<P>	Demographic trends suggest that socially responsible investment managers will increasingly be among this group of select managers. As the environment continues to be a concern, investors will direct more and more of their assets to screened portfolios. Although the environment will most likely be the dominant issue among social investors, other issues such as human rights, employee relations, and weapons will also be at the forefront.</P>

<P>	Most important, community development lending and shareholder activism will become the actual tools of progressive social change. The next century will see an increase in the number of banks and lending institutions directed towards rebuilding economically depressed communities. Shareholder activism will be the voice of consciousness for changing the behavior of corporate America.</P>

Unlike passive  investments in publicly traded  companies, Calvert Ventures makes  investments at a company's moment of  creation.  "These are the seeds of our  society's enterprises of tomorrow.   Values based participation at the  formative stage is key to a sustainable  future."<BR>    --D.

NAME="why"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Why Calvert Ventures?</B></FONT></A> <BR>       Increasing concern about social issues is one of the strongest trends  in American society today.  Environmental problems, energy costs,  the education of our children, rising health care costs--these and  many other issues have become the focus of a national discussion  taking place in our communities, our government, and the media.   <P>   Until now, great effort has been put into the resolution of these  problems by public means--public interest groups, political action  committees, church organizations, and government legislation.   What is needed are additional means by which the power of private  enterprise can foster meaningful social change.     <P>  Investors have found, however, that they have the greatest impact  on the future growth of companies when their investment occurs at  the formative stages of development.  To meet this opportunity,  Calvert Social Venture Partners was created as the first social  venture capital fund in 1989.     <P>    We believe that by providing financial and managerial support to  young, socially responsible companies we can help create a new  generation of American business -- one that realizes the vision of  simultaneously creating economic and social gains.  Our mission is  to be a model institutional investor and innovator in the financial  services field, and as such we will only invest in companies which  demonstrate clear market and financial potential in areas that make  positive contributions to the public good.    <P><IMG SRC="logosml2.gif" HSPACE=5  ALIGN="left" >  <A 
NAME="investments"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Kinds of Investments</B></FONT></A> <BR>        Any company seeking investment from Calvert Ventures must  possess an innovative business solution to a significant social  problem.  Calvert Ventures invests in companies which contain the  promise of creating a more healthy, peaceful and productive world  through the very nature of their products, services and methods of  business.  <P>     While we confine our investments to those companies that have a  positive social impact, investments must meet the same stringent  requirements for risk and return that other venture capital  investors require.  Unlike many other venture capital firms,  however, not every company we support must project future annual  sales of $50 to $100 million.  <P> Calvert Ventures' primary areas of investments are health and  human resources, education, environment, and energy.  We seek to  invest in early stage, emerging growth companies.  We intend to  emphasize initial 
rounds of outside funding after the concept or  prototype stage.  Generally, we seek to be the lead investor,  providing between $50,000 and $250,000 of financing.  Investments  may be as large as $500,000.    <P>               <IMG SRC="logosml2.gif" HSPACE=5  ALIGN="left" > <A NAME="what_calvert_brings"><FONT SIZE=4><B> What Calvert brings to a company</B></FONT></A><BR>   We believe that start-up corporations and expanding businesses  need the availability of adequate financing and the professional  expertise that experienced business advisors can provide.  We  welcome opportunities where we can provide more than just  financial resources; ours is a "value added" approach.      <P>We provide advice (without charging fees) on strategic and policy  decisions.  Board level participation will benefit strategic decision  making and problem resolution.  We also assist companies in finding  additional financing, management and board members, and  introduce them to industry and market contacts, bankers,  accountants, attorneys and other valuable service providers.   <P>            <IMG SRC="logosml2.gif" HSPACE=5  ALIGN="left" > <A NAME="contact_info"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Contact Information</B></FONT></A><BR>         For more information, please contact John May, Managing Partner,  or Steve Moody, Associate Portfolio Manager, at Calvert Social Venture Partners, 7201  Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 310, Bethesda, MD 20814; telephone 301-718-4272;  fax 301-656-4421; e-mail: <A HREF="mailto:calven2000@aol.com">calven2000@aol.com</A>     <P> To learn more about socially responsible investing, you can contact  other organizations which work with Calvert Ventures, including  <A HREF="http://www.bsr.org">Business for Social Responsibility</A>, Calvert Social Investment Fund,  the <A HREF="http://www.svn.org">Social Venture Network</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.srbnet.org">Students for Responsible Business</A>.   <P>          Although Calvert Social Venture Partners has no official ties to the  Calvert Group of funds, D.

<img src = "/greenbar.gif" alt = "The GreenMoney On-Line Guide">



<H3>Integrative Investing: Why Your Values Matter in the World of Money</H3>



<P>We have been writing <I>The GreenMoney Journal </I> for more than three years. When drafting articles we ask: "What can we say that we have not said before?" The answers take many forms. Usually we kick around a few ideas, selecting one that is inspirational, truthful, and compelling. Often the idea comes in the form of a question. For example: "Would you feel good about your annual return if you knew people, places, and other creatures suffered for your profit?" Or, more strongly: "Can you, are you willing to, profit from death and destruction?"</P>



<P>We then settle toward the middle ground and move forward with the article...we evolve as the article evolves. Then the article is complete and we start again.</P>



<P>We design the questions to challenge ourselves, trusting that challenge is good. We trust the challenge will encourage a new financial ethic bringing hope, peace, and profit to this and future generations.</P>



<P>"Integrative Investing" issues a challenge, asking that we understand what we give and what we take. This requires a shift in consciousness. If (as you read) you find yourself resisting the challenge, ask, "what am I taking?" and, "what am I giving (or what am I unwilling to give)?" The answers may lead to a subtle shift in your willingness to see clearly the foundation of your finances, your life, and our world.</P>



<P><B>SCREENING</B></P>



<P>Screening your investments integrates your values with your money. The following is a list of social investing screens. For more information you can call any of the mutual funds listed on page nine and request a copy of their screening criteria. Which screens integrate your beliefs?</P>



<P><B>POSITIVE SCREENS (SEEK): </B></P>



<UL>



<LI>Good labor relations, effective equal opportunity for women and minorities, employment practices, human rights record, community relations, family benefits, affordable housing, education, health care, child care, elderly care </LI>



<LI>Good customer relations, corporate openness &amp; citizenship, worker health and safety, community development, charitable giving, product safety and quality </LI>



<LI>Good environmental record, CERES Principles (environmental standards) signatory, conservation, alternative energy, recycling programs, natural &amp; sustainable farming and food production.</LI>



</UL>



<P><B>NEGATIVE SCREENS (AVOID):</B></P>



<UL>



<LI>Discriminatory labor and employment practices, Human rights record, repressive government, defense and weapon contractors </LI>



<LI>Poor environmental record/EPA violators, nuclear power, pesticide exports, alcohol, tobacco, gambling, use of animals in testing, junk bonds. </LI>



</UL>



<P><B>SOME OPINIONS ON SCREENING: </B></P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"Social screens are changing in two ways. We are becoming more sophisticated in our evaluation methodology, and we are adding new standards. In the first area, we are getting better at evaluating the role of women and minorities in the company; we are better at gathering information on non-U.S. operations; we are stricter about the environment. In terms of new standards, we are defining appropriate products more stringently, and are moving beyond alcohol, tobacco, gambling, nuclear power, and military weaponry and have begun evaluating consumerism and the impact it has on society." <BR>- Amy Domini, Domini 400 Social Index</P>



</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"Fortunately, from our perspective, the type of companies that we invest in are growth companies and fast-growing companies that are very young and have very young management. They are inherently very progressive and have a good corporate culture already. So, that makes our job a lot easier. There aren't very many companies that are screened out of our portfolio that meet our fundamental criteria. They're inherently very clean already."<BR>- Cedd Moses, Calvert Social Growth Fund</P>



</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"The social records of most companies are in shades of gray. We pay particular attention to progress -- to the overall direction that companies take towards demonstrated leadership in social impact." <BR>-Neuberger &amp; Berman Funds </P>



</BLOCKQUOTE>



<P>John Templeton is the founder of a premier domestic and international mutual fund company. He has written widely on the leading of a spiritually fulfilling and useful life. Tenets of his philosophy include: truthfulness, altruism, enthusiasm, and perseverance. <I>Business Ethics </I> magazine recently asked him, where does he stand on ethical investing? "I believe all of us should try to be more ethical. We first have to do a lot of soul searching to decide what our ethics are. Then we can apply those ethics in so many ways; investing is just a tiny part of it. We should apply ethics in the way we think, the way we treat people, and with our families. In every relationship in the world we apply ethics. One of those is how we choose our investments. Each person, having made up his list of ethics, doesn't find it hard to look at his stock and say, "Is this corporation primarily involved in something that is harmful?" If it is, then he doesn't feel comfortable owning shares in a company primarily doing harmful work."</P>



<P>Approximately 50 percent of the largest 1,000 publicly traded U.S. companies meet most socially responsible mutual funds screening criteria. The Domini 400 Social Index contains 255 companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 (S&amp;P 500). </P>



<P>Are there performance sacrifices when investing in socially and environmentally responsible ways? No. Consider these numbers: The Domini 400 Social Index (DSI) was launched in 1990 by Kinder, Lydenberg and Domini (KLD) to track 400 companies that pass multiple social screens. From May 1990 through December 1994, the DSI returned 70.41 percent compared to 60.38 percent for the S&amp;P 500. The DSI will have the five-year figures in May 1995. For more information call Karen Pratt of KLD at (617) 547-7479.</P>

<P><B>RETURN HIGHLIGHTS OF 1994</B></P>



<P>Los Angeles based-fund manager Cedd Moses returned 18.6% in the new Calvert Strategic Growth Fund. Since its inception last May, the fund's return ranked #1 out of 508 funds in the Growth category. The average return of all Growth funds was .60% (May 5-Dec. 31). The fund's assets are approaching $100 million. Cedd Moses, President of Portfolio Advisory Services was recognized as the top performing mid-cap growth manager by Nelson's 1994 "Directory of Investment Advisors" for the three year period ending 12/31/93. He has been a member of the Social Investment Forum since 1989 and manages several socially screened portfolios for private clients. The primary objectives of his investment strategy are to create long-term capital gains during favorable markets cycles and to protect capital during down market cycles. To find recent interviews of Cedd, see <I>Business Ethics </I> (Jan./Feb. 95) and Financial Planning on Wall Street (Jan. 95)</P>



<P>The long standing Parnassus Fund (managed by Jerry Dodson) had another stellar year, returning 12.0% for 1994. The fund ranked #10 out of 481 Growth funds. The average return for all Growth funds during 1994 was -2.2%. The fund's assets have grown to over $155 million. The Parnassus Fund is reporting impressive five- and ten-year return figures as well, averaging a annual return of 16.6% and 13.3% a year, respectively. Mr. Dodson credits their success to a solid investment strategy and quality social research. He was recently highlighted in <I>Barron's</I> (Nov. 7, 94) and interviewed in <I>Business Ethics </I> (Jan./Feb. 95).</P>



<P>The Parnassus Fund is the fifth socially &amp; environmentally screened fund having at least a ten-year track record. The other four funds with their ten-year average annual returns are: Calvert Social Managed Growth 10.4%, Dreyfus Third Century 11.1%, New Alternatives 10.7%, and Pax World 10.3%. Once again, the returns shows you can make money ethically.</P>



<P>Pax World Fund had a good showing in 1994, with a return of 2.6%. The fund ranked #6 out of 152 Balanced funds. The average return for all Balanced funds was -2.5%. New Alternatives Fund ranked #1 out of 9 Environmental Funds for 1994, with a return of -3.7%. The average return for all Environmental funds was -10.5%.</P>



<P>(Note: All return figures and financial rankings are from Lipper Analytical Services and Morningstar).</P>



<P><B>1994 INDUSTRY CHANGES</B></P>



<P>Ariel and Calvert mutually decided to end their marketing and financial relationship. Ariel Funds will be managed and marketed by minority manager John Rogers in Chicago, IL.</P>



<P>Calvert introduced "C" shares, allowing individuals to buy their funds no-load. The fund charge higher annual distribution (12b-1) fees, so instead of paying a commission up front, the client pays for services while money is under management.</P>



<P>Calvert changed sub advisors on the CSIF Equity Portfolio from US Trust in Boston to Loomis Sayles &amp; Co. in Washington, D.C. The change was intended to boost performance. So far this has not been the case (the fund was down 12% for 1994).</P>



<P>Domini Social Equity Fund changed fund managers from State Street Bank to Mellon Equity Associates, a subsidiary of Mellon Bank. The new fund manager is John O'Toole.</P>



<P>Dreyfus Third Century Fund changed sub advisor from Tiffany Capital advisers to minority-owned NCM Capital Management. Be aware, NCM has decided to buy into utilities that operate nuclear plants.</P>



<P>Working Assets added the Muir California Tax-Free Fund to their family of funds. </P>



<P>The press continued its coverage of Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) with articles in<I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, <I>Business Ethics</I>, <I>In Business</I>, <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>Washington Post</I>, <I>Out</I>, <I>Smart Money</I>, <I>Los Angeles Times</I>, <I>Co-op America Quarterly</I>, <I>Fortune</I>, <I>The Spokesman-Review</I>, <I>The Lutheran</I>, <I>Barron's</I>, United Airlines' <I>Hemispheres</I>, and <I>Green Living</I>.</P>

<P>The battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is continuing on: The SEC has made it more difficult for investors to file socially oriented resolutions for debate at corporate annual shareholder meetings. The Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) is working to assure the right of investors to bring forth shareholder resolutions on a variety of issues. When asked to define shareholder resolutions, how responsible investors use them, and some of the resolution issues ICCR responded, "A shareholder resolution is a strategy used by a stockholder who wants to change a company policy or practice. A shareholder who owns $1000 or more in stock can offer one resolution per company per year. Resolutions must address significant policy or governance issues and cannot be concerned with ordinary business operations of the corporation. The shareholder must own the stock for one year before filing. Socially responsible investors use resolutions to encourage companies to operate by ethically sound policies.</P>



<P>ICCR believes, as we do, that there is a link between social and financial performance. By using our prerogatives as shareholders to promote social change, ICCR believes that we are both helping companies improve long-term profitability and enhancing the society's well-being. Issues that are being included in ICCR-member shareholder resolutions: Board of Directors composition (diversity) -- including women and ethnic minorities; CERES Principles (endorsement of this set of environmental standards); equal employment opportunity; reporting to shareholders; challenging operations in repressive countries like Burma; monitoring South African operations; and tobacco -- selling to minors, smoke-free restaurants and work areas." (In our next issue - [Fall/Winter 1995, at the end of this article], we'll discuss how individuals and institutions file shareholder resolutions). For more information about ICCR and their shareholder advocacy program, call Tim Smith or Harry Van Buren at (212) 870-2293.</P>



<H4>WOMEN</H4>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"Women need information in order to prepare financially for their future, and the traditional sources of that information do not take into account many of their needs. To further complicate the situation, women's perceptions of the world, as well as how they take in and process information is different than most men. Women want a holistic approach to financial information. They want to integrate information about their economic status as individuals and as a group within a larger society. Women consider who is managing their money. Women want to know the company and the people they are dealing with. Finally, women have an extremely high social awareness. Women integrate their lives with the community, their families and friends, their business and their investments." <BR>-Mardelle Ceaser, Calvert Group</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"As socially responsible investors -- now more than ever -- we have an important role to play in reshaping the world order. At Working Assets, we recognize that socially responsible investing means more than purchasing the right stock and earning dividends.

<H4>GLOBAL</H4>



<P>In our increasingly integrated global economy (with trade pacts of GATT and NAFTA being passed), how does a socially and environmentally responsible investor participate in the world of global investing? The answer: Calvert World Values Global Equity Fund (WVGE) and Working Assets Citizens Global Equity Portfolio (CGEP).</P>



<P>The United States currently represents only 36.4% of the world's stock markets, so investing globally gives you greater opportunity for portfolio diversification and the potential for higher returns. Projecting to the year 2000, as little as 20 percent of the world economy will be in the U.S. stock market. </P>



<P>Investing outside the U.S., however, carries additional risks; one such risk is currency fluctuation, which could positively or negatively impact the return on international securities to U.S. investors. Political instability is also a risk factor. Generally speaking, it is more difficult to gather information on foreign companies, because their accounting and reporting standards are not the same as ours. Jon Lickerman, Calvert's Social Research Director recently stated that responsible Global funds "face unique challenges in finding ways to apply social criteria to a wide range of corporations, cultures, and regulatory structures." </P>



<P>We recommend that you call each fund to get an accurate picture of their Global screening criteria. Also see the country allocation chart on this page. </P>



<P>The 1994 Global Fund Returns: Calvert WVGE -2.7%, Working Assets CGEP -2.7%. The average return for all Global Funds was -3.0%, according to Lipper Analytical Services.</P>



<P><B>FUND PROFILE: Calvert World Values Global Equity Fund</B></P>



<P>The fund invests in companies that offer potential for strong returns and operate as responsible corporate citizens. The fund looks to invest in companies that enhance the quality of life by providing health care or other essential services, improving the infrastructure and protecting the natural environment. The fund seeks a high total return through investment in a broadly diversified portfolio of domestic and international stocks that meet the fund's criteria for social and environmental responsibility. </P>



<P>The fund is managed by Murray Johnstone International, a Scottish money management firm in business since 1907. They have offices in Glasgow, Scotland and Chicago, IL. Murray Johnstone monitors over 30 stock markets worldwide, including analysis of the emerging markets universe. They have an active, fundamentally disciplined investment style that first decides on country allocations and then, on individual stock selections.</P>



<P>Morningstar stated "This fund does give socially conscious investors a viable tool for international diversification," giving it an overall rating of A-.</P>

<P><B>FUND PROFILE: Working Assets Citizens Global Equity Portfolio</B></P>



<P>The objective of the fund is capital appreciation by investment in both foreign and U.S. markets. It is designed to give investors the opportunity to participate in what promises to be a period of dramatic international expansion. Investing in foreign companies and on international exchanges may entail greater risk than investing solely in the U.S. The fund attempts to keep the same screening criteria as in its other funds. </P>



<P>The fund is managed by Clemente Capital, a women-owned firm with an internationally diverse workforce. Staff represents 15 countries and 20 languages. They have offices in New York, Hong Kong, Manila and Beijing. Clemente has a in-house research database on 10,000 companies.</P>



<P>Lilia Clemente, Chairwoman of Clemente Capital and primary investment manager believes "global investment offers an opportunity to reduce risk and increase returns by linking security and prosperity to performance of an array of markets and companies instead of concentrating only in the U.S. The diversification made possible by overseas investments tempers the impact of any single event and creates potential for steady, long-term growth of underlying assets."</P>

<H3>The Responsible Super Information Highway: Filtering to the Relevant</H3>

<P>In this article we cruise the information superhighway in the responsible lane looking for well-researched, accurate, honest and timely information. Information that helps us make investing and purchasing decisions that reflect our values and align our principles and profits. For example "Grape-Nuts" cereal is made by Post. Store brands Post, Kraft and Jell-O are all owned by Phillip Morris, manufacturer of Marlboro cigarettes. Did you know that Oreo Cookies and all Nabisco products are made by RJR Nabisco, manufacturer of Camel cigarettes? How about Eagle Snacks? A product of Annheuser-Busch, manufacturer of Budweiser beer. Does financially supporting these companies reflect your values? We want you to know who and what you are supporting at the supermarket and in the stock market. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>"We move toward accountability through reliable information."</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>GreenMoney's continuing goal is to provide straightforward, well-researched, and up-to-date information for responsible investors and consumers.</P>

<P>Information overload, however, is epidemic. Many desire to filter out the irrelevant. The GreenMoney Journal (GMJ) is often asked big questions like: </P>

<UL>

<LI>What are we collectively responsible for in life? </LI>

<LI>Does spending and investing in conscious ways make a difference? </LI>

<LI>Is taking care of what we have part of our responsibility as humans? </LI>

<LI>What information sources exist along the information highway that support responsible living? </LI>

<LI>What sources can we trust? </LI>

<LI>How do you assess the information's usefulness? </LI>

</UL>

<P>These questions are personal. Answers come by learning to internalize the connection between your beliefs, available information and the world of money and investing. GMJ offers focused support for this process. </P>

<P>"<I>The GreenMoney Journal </I> is information networking."</P>

<P>The three research organizations highlighted in this article look in-depth at the corporate world, continually monitoring corporate activities. They work for positive relationships with the companies monitored. They have developed clear boundaries of acceptability and work to share a common purpose with the companies. This helps insure corporate responsibility and accountability. The information they provide helps novice and more experienced consumers and investors make important financial decisions. </P>

<H4>INFORMATION RESOURCES</H4>

<P><B>Franklin Research &amp; Development (FRDC)</B></P>

<P>FRDC was founded in 1982 by Joan Bavaria. This employee-owned company is dedicated to social change through responsible investing.</P>

<P>FRDC believes that investing must also make a positive impact on the economy, society, environment, and world in which we live. They are committed to the vision that through research, reasoned capital allocation and proactive dialogue, concerned investors can have a positive impact on society. </P>

<P>"The responsible investment of capital demands more than superior financial return, investing must also make a positive impact on the economy, society, environment, and world." <BR>- FRDC </P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>FRDC rates socially responsible mutual funds on a variety of issues. They provide these rating to <I>The GreenMoney Journal</I>. (See the Performance Chart in the Mutual Funds category for the social ratings and further explanation).</P>

<P>FRDC manages the Better World Fund, a pension investment fund launched by General American, a life insurance company. This socially screened growth fund is available to qualified pension plans, including 401k and 403b plans. Investment strategy focuses on the double bottom line of companies: both their financial and social profiles, as well as companies with ethical business practices and positive earnings growth.</P>

<P>Patrick McVeigh, Vice President of Franklin Research &amp; Development Corporation has provided GreenMoney with the following inside look: </P>

<P>"Though socially responsible assets under management at FRDC have grown steadily over the past decade to approximately $380 million, our vision of the future is more about redefining investments than about how fast the field can grow.</P>

<P>Most investment terms have dual meanings. Equity, for example, to the investment professional signifies stock ownership. To others it means fairness. The word change to the businessperson equates with money returned in a transaction. To others it means to transform. At FRDC, we believe the major challenge for those in the social investment community is to link these different definitions and to concretely show how investments can bring fairness and transformation to the world community. </P>

<P>Over the past year, FRDC has been involved in a number of activities that we believe have taken steps in this direction. We worked very closely with Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, in writing a code of conduct for its suppliers. All of Wal-Mart's thousands of worldwide suppliers must now agree not to discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation or political opinion. Quite a victory when one considers that even in the U.S., nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation is not a right guaranteed at most firms. We also worked with McDonald's to get them to endorse the belief that "the humane treatment of animals is a moral responsibility" and require that their suppliers follow a tough set of guidelines.</P>

<P>Other achievements include getting a growing number of large companies to agree to the need to submit to an annual, standardized reporting on their environmental impact. Through the CERES Coalition, an independent organization started by Joan Bavaria, FRDC's president, firms such as General Motors and Sun Company have recently joined this process. Many other major companies are expected to endorse this process soon.</P>

<P>Through our investment management services for individuals, institutions and 401k retirement plans, and our newsletter, Investing for a Better World, we look forward to continuing to play a role in redefining investment possibilities."</P>

these funds concentrate on only one sector, they tend to be more

<LI><P><FONT SIZE="4">SOCIAL RATINGS:</FONT></P><P>Each socially
responsible mutual fund has its own social screens and employs its own
methods to determine the social value of each investment.  Some funds
emphasize searching for companies with positive social values and take
an active role in promoting social change through shareholder
resolutions and dialogue with corporate decision makers.  Other funds
simply avoid investing in firms or activities deemed irresponsible.  A
sketch of the qualitative rating system follows:</P><DL>
<DT><B>Grade A</B></DT>
<DD>Funds that have comprehensive, quality screens that are applied
consistently.  Seeks to invest in firms with above-average social
profiles.  Will not invest in firms that are below-average in any major
social area or the fund will actively work for improvement of this
concern.  Makes high impact investments such as community loan funds
and/or the fund management company donates significant profits to
targeted social problems.  Maintains a consistent record of shareholder
activism through resolutions and corporate dialogue.</DD>
<DT><B>Grade B</B></DT>
<DD>Funds that have some shareholder activism, some use of influence
(letter writing, public dialogue). Average screen quality or scope.  May
have greater emphasis on avoiding bad companies rather than investing in
good companies.</DD>
<DT><B>Grade C</B></DT>
<DD>Funds have minimal or no shareholder activism or use of influence. 
screens are avoidance-based or of limited scope.  Screens may be applied
inconsistently.</DD>

It's much more challenging to address <b>leadership</b>
&#151; leadership that is based on values and addresses the needs of
your people. Without those values that foster efficient, ethical and

consistently sustain success on a daily basis. <EM>Success failures
would be felt in employee morale and experienced in poor service and
product quality</EM>.</P>

about: Helping your trainers and organization establish the <EM>work
and people</EM> balance.</P>

being a productive, functional group. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to

time, effort and money? The TIGERS Team Survey does just that.</P>

<P>Are you interested in discovering new opportunities for grass straw utilization? We're looking for business partners. Here's a product opportunity using an under utilized resource. Currently we have over 40,000 acres of bluegrass grown for seed in Eastern Washington and another 30,000 acres grown across the border in Idaho. There are approximately 3-6 tons of straw residue per acre. Farmers estimate it costs them $20 an acre to bale off the initial residue. Grass straw can be used for animal feed, pulp and paper, fuel supplement, fiberboard, on-farm composting, commercial soil amendments such as hydromulch, and potting medium. What are your ideas? What talent could you bring to this partnership? Based on economic and technologic factors of today's marketplace, what are some of the viable alternatives we could implement in the near future? We estimate that conservatively 280,000 tons of grass straw residue are being open-field burned annually in our area of the Pacific Northwest. This practice creates significant health impacts to our general population and to our environment. Surely there are solutions and marketable options.

<H3>INVESTING THOUGHT: LOST AND FOUND</H3>
<H4>by Tom Kliewer, Co-Editor</H4>
<P>One recent summer morning I hiked a trail I have known
for years. As I started out the day was cool and threatened
rain, but as the morning passed the sky cleared and it grew
increasingly hot. To save time I took an unknown but
recommended shortcut back to the trail head and found myself
lost...</P>
<P>Not lost in the way a person could find themselves out at
sea, but lost in that, looking out at the world, I saw
nothing I recognized... no familiar landmark of any kind.</P>
<P>My very old dog had come along and she was, by now,
thirsty -- head dragging thirsty. I wondered out loud
{Special Char 210 in Font &quot;Times&quot;}Where am
I?{Special Char 211 in Font &quot;Times&quot;} and heard a
splash.</P>
<P>She had discovered a small oval pool of water left deep
in the forest shade by a drying creek. She was belly deep in
ecstasy and I was found. Not in the way you will find me at
home or at my desk, but found in the place where a certain
harmony is known - restored... and tension has no
purpose.</P>
<P>It was a matter of time before I returned to the
familiar, but that day I was no longer lost in any way that
matters.</P>

<H3>INVESTING THOUGHT</H3>

<H4>by Tom Kliewer</H4>

<P>	The other day Cliff and I were talking about the Journal ... what it is, what it could be...</P>

<P>	I thought of the sweeping changes ethical investing has the power to bring about and noticed myself balancing the "sweeping (outside) changes" with a deep desire for inner change. For peace of mind, for support, and clear guiding purpose. When I feel these needs I usually look to my bookshelf for inspiration. I know, however, a book will not do. I feel a deep alone-ness.</P>

<P>	Ethical investing requires that one knows ones values&#150; we need to know our values before we can support them. Once we know this, there is the process of aligning our lives with our values...and then the deeper work: will we laugh at jokes that degrade a person? Will we pause to know the result of our often hasty verbal exchanges? This is the place where I suspect that my own path starts. Were I on a hike this is the where I would leave the trail and seek a destination I only suspect exists...where I take the road less traveled. There are few guides for the inner journey. I can say at any moment that I made a mistake, that I have grown tired of the journey, or that I have lost sight of the way. That can happen, but the thought calls forth a failure on my part so profound that I hesitate to even consider it... I am my own best guide on this journey, the only true feedback I receive is through myself. Committing to this choice is (for me) winter's purpose. The alone-ness has a value beyond gold. In the quiet absence of others I have the chance to listen to myself. I may hear the rattle of a pebble in a tin can or the surging ocean of sea shell to ear...and then again I may hear the voice of true direction.</P>

<H3>INVESTING THOUGHT: OUR BEST INVESTMENT</H3>



<P>I was once a field worker in a small town, my job was to check the energy efficiency of private homes. I was eventually in most every house in town. It was the mid 80's and home schooling was just getting started. My first impression was not good.</P>



<P>I saw children sitting around the television, tired (sometimes nursing) mothers, and a curriculum that strayed into "dishwashing 101"... I mean that household chores appeared to become course work. Please don't misunderstand that last comment. A good work ethic and a clean home are great, but I wondered if the children might not be a bit disadvantaged if they entered college and were inappropriately compelled to wash and dry test tubes and beakers during chemistry lab. I considered perhaps the children were being segregated from society for religious reasons. Religious considerations aside, I have lived to reform my poor opinion of the home school.</P>



<P>I recently visited a couple and their five children. Of the five, one chose home schooling. Both parents work on the curriculum and support the home school effort, establishing standards of impressive depth. It is clear this child is nurtured not handicapped by his choice. The other children receive supplemental schooling on Saturdays: sports and personal interests are highlighted.</P>



<P>I relearned from this family that every life option has brilliant potential. I am saying that home school, financial management, welfare, travel (a world of ideas) have potential for valuable application.</P>



<P>It is convenient/easy to judge the less effectual perhaps abusive efforts of some and overlook the brilliant and focused efforts of others.</P>



<P>I believe a balanced and thoughtfully considered view of our options is, at this point, our best investment. &#150; Tom Kliewer, Co-Editor</P>

<H3>MODERATION</H3>



<P>As a child adults around me often said "moderation in all things." When said, others murmured agreement &#150; like a prayer, or the spontaneous appreciation of a rich desert. Obviously they believed this was good advice. In the throws of youthful passion I considered moderation rather dry.</P>



<P>Thirty some years later dry is looking pretty good... dry works for me.</P>



<P>I respond to my perceptions differently now. Then the governments confusion was a source of amusement, now I realize they are confused on my dime. Then the approved social order was a sort of behavioral straitjacket. Now (having faced gruesome experience in the absence of social order) I am comforted by the general &#150; though diminishing &#150; predictability of this social order.</P>



<P>This comfort does not mean that I have permission to lead an unexamined life. When I see a poor fit between kindness and reality (humanity and principle), I find myself searching for methods of change. </P>



<P>SRI is one such method. I can invest my dollars in healing the rift between my personal sense of rightness and humankind, between "us" and the world that holds us close.</P>



<P>The same nature which caused me to wait 30 years to appreciate "moderation in all things" caused me to loose faith that positive change happens. Through SRI and other self nurturing acts my doubts are gradually fading... and that's a significant moderation I can live with. &#150; Tom Kliewer, Co-Editor </P>

<img src="/greenbar.gif" alt="The GreenMoney On-Line Guide">

<H3>TRUTHFUL STORIES</H3>



<P>In the luscious book Out of Africa, Isak Dinesen talked of the written communication (letters) exchanged in local tribes as they integrated European influence. She spoke of the letter's form being more significant than its actual content. How designated "letter writers" were hired to write personal letters without personal content. </P>



<P>At the time I thought that fascinating... personal letters without personal content.</P>



<P>If a friend wrote me a letter devoid of personal content I would assume one of two things: they were being held hostage or they had gone stark raving mad. </P>



<P>It crosses my mind that current political elections are handled in much the same way. Candidates repeat what consultants, party affiliation, and information poles dictate, keeping political form correct while disregarding content. </P>



<P>What would the difference be if the candidates told truthful stories anchored in the possibility of sustainable change for the betterment of person-kind, the environment and the future?</P>



<P>Instead of disjointed attacks at opposing candidates they might talk about what they truly hoped to DO as elected officials. Not promises about our dreams but realistic stories about what we might expect to see in the coming years and how we might effect a positive influence... what we might do to keep heart and hearth in line, how we might realize our greener dreams. </P>



<P>In GreenMoney we strive to tell stories that align principles with potential and stand a chance of creating a better world. Perhaps if we began to ask candidates for better, more personal stories, we could make more informed political choices. We could elect candidates with personal content trusting that they were neither being held hostage or stark raving mad. &#151; Tom Kliewer, Co-Editor</P>

<H3>BEAUTY &amp; THE FUTURE</H3>



<P>Summer passes. My days are filled with family, work, and play. These categories bracket my life in a way I never envisioned as a boy wandering through endless summer. Accepting the passing of childhood allows me to see the passage into adulthood, and to appreciate the beauty of the change. There is a calm reassurance: what is beautiful is most often good.</P>



<P>Awake late last night I picked up the book, Seeds of Change and began another form of wandering: through the cycle of life as represented by the seed. </P>



<P>The seed promises that life endures loss, change, all the various winters, recreating herself generously with each new spring. My intention here is not (against all evidence) to present a case for the seed as the ideal analogy for life... although that would be a valid point. I desire instead to present a case for installing beauty permanently, consistently, in our vision of the future. </P>



<P>Beauty is the deep and certain blueprint of a future worth living. Her face lights the way for families, neighborhoods and nations to a world we can experience with trust and joy. It is my belief that this trust and joy far exceeds fear of loss or "fighting the good fight" as a motivation for change.</P>



<P>To draw these thoughts together I ask that beauty enter your vision of the future, let her work in your imagination. Consider that life can be more than avoiding evil and repairing damage. Consider that life may in fact be the process of defining and welcoming beauty into our homes, neighborhoods, world, and yes: our business. -Tom Kliewer, Co-Editor</P>

<H3>Global Investing: Practical Arguments Against It </H3>

<P><B>by Peter Kinder, President of Kinder, Lydenberg &amp; Domini.</B></P>

<P></P>

<P>"For the socially responsible investor, global investing poses a practical and a moral problem. </P>

<P>"Can Mexico Cope?" asked <I>Business Week </I> when the bottom dropped out of the peso and Mexican stocks and bonds. A better question would be, "Will U.S. investors ever learn?"</P>

<P>Countries survive financial debacles, but investors seldom learn: </P>

<P>They know little about the countries and still less about the companies in which they are investing;</P>

<P>They must factor currency risks into every investment decision involving a non-U.S. securities issuer; and</P>

<P>Cultural and legal barriers restrict the quantity and quality of information available to them about securities issuers outside the U.S.</P>

<P>All global investors suffer from the effects of ignorance, currency risks, and the lack of reliable information. Socially responsible investors and green investors, especially, must worry about the lack of social data available to rate companies and governments.</P>

<P>For social investors, the lack of government-required data is of less importance than the restrictions libel laws impose on the flow of information -- especially negative information.</P>

<P>And, the situation gets worse as you go farther east. The close links between governments and corporations, may allow corporate affairs to fall under official secret acts. As we'll see in the next issue, the bright line Americans perceive (wrongly!) separating corporations from government does not exist elsewhere." </P>

<H3>Global Investing: The Moral Argument Against It</H3>

<P><B>by Peter Kinder of Kinder, Lydenberg &amp; Domini</B></P>

<P></P>

<P>"In the last issue, we looked at the practical case against investing in non-U.S. stocks and bonds: investors -- social and otherwise -- do not know enough about the countries, companies and currencies in which they are investing. And, even if they want to learn, the data simply isn't available.</P>

<P>If the practical considerations were not compelling, the moral ones would be.</P>

<P>Most investors want to use their investments to both make money and effect positive social change. (In my view, SRI is politics by other means.) Purging a portfolio of bovine growth hormone purveyors or rain forest despoilers provides temporary satisfaction. To effect social change, investors use conventional investments by lobbying the corporation.</P>

<P>Research organizations, like ours, that serve money managers raise the issues that concern social investors with corporate officers. Screened funds, like the Domini Social Equity Fund, that vote their proxies and report their votes to the public and the corporations achieve the same end. Most research organizations and screened funds support U.S. shareholder activists, such as the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) who use the proxy process to engage corporations in dialogue on, say, the CERES Principles.</P>

<P>The opportunities to change corporate behavior are far more limited -- where they are not non-existent -- outside the United States. Even in Canada and the United Kingdom, corporate laws keep almost all such issues off the ballot. So, if you cannot use money to achieve your goals, why invest in non-U.S. securities issuers?</P>

<P>In my view, social investors wishing to invest outside the U.S. should focus on micro-enterprise loan funds, such as ACCION International and Working Capital. You won't get the eye-popping returns that you would by hitting an emerging market at the right moment. But, the loan funds have a good reputation for safety of principal and payment of interest. And, they fund social change of the most positive sort.</P>

<P>Of course, there's a need here in the U.S. for the same type of investments. Krista Kallio of Access Capital in Cambridge, Mass., pointed out at a recent conference, that investors looking to LDCs for emerging markets should put many of our cities and some rural regions in the same category.</P>

<P>The argument was best stated by Adam Smith in a passage from <I>The Wealth of Nations </I> that is often misrepresented:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>"By preferring the support of domestick [sic] [industry] to that of foreign industry, [the merchant] intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention... By pursing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it."</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>All things being equal, Smith argued, you should buy goods locally to strengthen your society. When things aren't equal, buy from foreign sources and pay with goods you produce better than they. But, foreign securities were not one of the things he had in mind.</P>

<P>Adam Smith regarded trading in the shares of the eighteenth century version of today's corporations as an anachronistic abomination. Limited liability insulated shareholders from responsibility for the actions of the companies they owned. Without responsibility, there could be no improvement in a society. Based on Smith's argument, I could contend that investing in foreign securities is a denial of your responsibility to improve your own society and for the actions of the companies in which you invest."</P>

<H3>How &amp; Why Do Individuals and Institutions File Shareholder Resolutions ?<BR></H3>

<P><B>by Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility (ICCR)<BR></B></P>

<P>Shareholders who want to file a resolution, start by submitting it to the company's CEO. The company reviews the resolution and decides if it will seek to omit it from the proxy statement.</P>

<P>If the company wants to omit the resolution, it asks the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC- the federal agency overseeing public companies) to issue a "no-action letter." The no-action letter tells the company's that the SEC believes the resolution can be omitted. If the SEC doesn't issue a no-action letter (thus disagreeing with the company), or if the company does not contest the resolution, then it is printed in the proxy statement and all shareholders vote on it.</P>

<P>The proxy statement lists all of the business to be conducted at the company's annual meeting -- usually including elections for both auditors and the board of directors, and resolutions offered by shareholders. Shareholders who are not able to be present can vote by mailing in a proxy card to the company. Shareholder resolutions must achieve an increasing percentage of votes to be offered in subsequent years -- three percent in the first year, six percent in the second year, and ten percent for the third and following years.</P>

<P>Filing a resolution gets the attention of a company's management. Because resolutions appear on proxy statements read by the company's ownership, they are important tool for spotlighting important social, financial, environmental, and corporate governance questions. Many resolutions are withdrawn by proponents after agreements with corporate managers to change specific policies. Resolutions therefore keep companies accountable to their shareholders.</P>

<P>What are ICCR's other activities? They maintain a clearinghouse on Alternative Investments that brings together people interested in making high-social impact investments with entities seeking capital. They publish The Corporate Examiner, a publication focusing on corporate behavior and its effect on society ($35 a year). They sponsor conferences on important corporate social responsibility topics. ICCR is helping South African banks and community development leaders find creative ways to work together by administering to the South African community. </P>

<P>ICCR Executive Director Tim Smith and Harry Van Buren recently wrote an article titled, Social Responsibility Movement: New Challenges in a Changing Environment in the Spring 1995 newsletter of the Social Investment Forum (SIF). The article gives an overview of the need for shareholder resolutions with or without the understanding of the SEC. In August- ICCR, Calvert Group and twenty-seven other institutional investors submitted a formal petition to the SEC requesting that the agency change its current interpretation of proxy rules and again advise companies not to omit shareholder resolutions on employment issues from their company proxy statements.</P>

<H3>SRI: The Next Five Years</H3>

<P><B>by Elizabeth Glenshaw, Franklin Research &amp; Development</B></P>

<P></P>

<P>"In its best moments, socially responsible investing involves making investment choices based on value-driven principles without the sacrifice of financial performance. In the early 1970s, for instance, investors divested from companies doing business in South Africa in an effort to aid that country's anti-apartheid movement. At the same time, they sought (and found) investment opportunities which produced satisfactory or better returns for their investors. As a result, the practice of social investing spread throughout the 1980s, ultimately "causing in" more than $650 billion in assets to be invested socially. At the same time, there was remarkable growth in the types of vehicles available for social investors (e.g., mutual funds, community development loan funds, and global funds).</P>

<P>What happens next? The creation of majority rule in South Africa brought an end to divestment practices in that country and the fear that some investors, particularly institutional investors, would return to familiar, non-social investment practices. I believe this forecast is inaccurate; knowledge and practice of social practices in the investment community cannot be turned back. In fact, I would even argue that well-rounded, diversified investment practices are defined by the inclusion of social criteria in some manner.</P>

<P>Yet how will social investing itself be defined, and what common thread will keep the movement strong? My belief is that the movement will acquire renewed vigor through shareholder activism. The opportunity to influence a company's behavior has caused a considerable number of clients, for instance, to invest in companies with less than perfect (or admirable) social records. Investors believe that their activism will not only produce a societal benefit, but also an improved financial return overall for the company in which they invest.</P>

<P>I also believe that the mantra of the socially responsible will be claimed by some investment houses in an effort to acquire market share, though in truth their only option is a screened, and thus limited, portfolio. The exciting and fascinating work in the near future will actually come from investment houses that offer "ethical" portfolios, ones which both remove and include companies according to particular social missions.</P>

<P>Finally, I believe that financial return will continue to be an important component of any social investment decision. An investment decision that does not produce an acceptable financial return is also a poor social investment decision.</P>

<P>Where will these changes lead us? While the future is, in truth, only as readable as the palm of my hand, my heart says that the social investment movement would do well to consider a return to South Africa as a model for its future. Instead of disintegrating into revolution and anarchy as well they could have, South Africans of virtually every race and political persuasion chose peace and cooperation in an effort to create their country and their lives anew. Social investors ought to consider the same. I believe that cooperation rather than mere competition will be the best means by which our mutual goals are achieved."</P>

<H3>SRI 2000</H3>
<P>by George Gay, Chief Operating Officer of <A href="/fafn/index.htm">First Affirmative Financial Network</A> </P>
<P></P>
<P>"Over the next five years, Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) will undergo many changes. Screening criteria will evolve, performance issues will be resolved, and the means by which SRI products and services will be delivered to the public, and how the public will pay for these products and services, may undergo the most change of all.</P>
<P>As Baby Boomers (which includes the largest number of social investors) continue to age, issues of quality of life, intergenerational equity and social order will grow in importance. Investors will focus more on the environment, urban conditions, education, health care, social security and other more senior citizen oriented issues. The pro-active concept of SRI will become more important to most investors than avoidance. Participation in shareholder activism will also grow, as more stockholders have the time and resources to participate in corporate governance. Since government at all levels will have decreasing resources to cope with social concerns, both due to fiscal constraints and a more politically conservative electorate, the requirement for social change through the private sector will become more imperative. The concept of the corporation as a "good neighbor," participating in the community and supporting education and other progressive concepts will become essential.</P>
<P>Products are likely to become more segmented, as the interests of more groups become represented by mutual funds. Instead of a growth in the category of broadly screened funds, expect to see funds with fewer screens targeted to special interest groups. Following the lead of the Women's Equity Fund, look for funds focused on gay and lesbian issues, funds for "traditional family values," funds representing ethnic or non-Christian religious views and other sectors dreamed up by marketing wizards. As Wall Street recognizes the size and commitment of the SRI market, more major firms will offer SRI funds and will establish SRI divisions. Just as 1994 saw the launch of "Women Investor" initiatives by several major fund groups, the next five years will see even more specialized marketing efforts.</P>
<P>As product lines become more diverse and more major firms put resources into the area, SRI&Otilde;s oldest bugaboo, that of inferior performance will finally be laid to rest. Performance within SRI will be recognized to be the same as in other sectors, i.e. dependent upon the quality and resources of management, not inherent to the social screens involved. Just as a "growth" or "value" style of management is recognized as a valid way to invest without "limiting the investment universe," a "socially responsible" style of management will develop. It would be a mistake, however, to allow the focus of SRI to be performance, which would put the SRI community on the playing field of the conventional investment industry.</P>
<P>The socially conscious consumer will increasingly demand a consultative service, not a sales process. SRI products and services will have to include large and ongoing doses of education about markets, about risks, and about social impact. The SRI professional will need to create long-lasting relationships with clients, and continue to add value to those relationships. Professional education, competence, and experience will have to blend with respect for the clients' values. As more people within the securities industry sense the "marketing opportunity" of SRI, there will be problems as they fail to understand that a shared sense of values is one of the key features that the consumer demands.</P>
<P>Much about socially responsible investing, perhaps even the name, may change over the rest of the decade. But that key concept of a personal awareness of values and a decision to invest in concert with those ethical beliefs and principles will become a more powerful basis for financial decisions. Today's SRI pioneers have already seen the future. It is that future which they have invested their time, their talents and their money to create." </P>

<H3>FIRST AFFIRMATIVE FINANCIAL NETWORK (<A href="/fafn/index.htm">FAFN</A> )</H3>
<P>The financial services industry is ever-changing, but with one constant: customer service.

The answer is First Affirmative Financial Network (FAFN), a national financial services firm based in Colorado. With a growing network of 56 financial professionals, FAFN is meeting the need of individuals, companies, and nonprofit organizations across the United States. </P>

</UL>
<P>First Affirmative Financial Network is committed to provide an essential service, that of assisting individuals to prepare for their financial security while supporting a progressive, just, sustainable and peaceful society." (End of the Mission Statement). </P>
<P>Most socially aware investors can meet their financial planning needs without sacrificing investment returns or increasing risks. FAFN believes that the most appropriate strategy to achieve positive social change is to take a long-term diversified investment approach. Their network of professionals can implement your financial plan utilizing a variety of SRI investments such as: Mutual Funds, Stocks, Municipal Bonds, Real Estate, Venture Capital, Government Agency Securities, Community Loan Funds, Corporate Bonds, Limited Partnerships, CD's as well as socially responsible life insurance policies and annuities.</P>
<P>FAFN was co-founded in 1982 by current President Ed Winslow, CPA, as a financial planning and consulting firm. Currently Ed runs the company with George Gay, CFP who has been the Chief Operating Officer since 1989. George is on the Board of the Social Investment Forum and is the Portfolio Manager of the Progressive Environmental Fund. FAFN has also been in partnership with Co-op America since 1988 providing socially responsible financial services to their 55,000 members.

<P>There is a variety options when determining how to best work with FAFN. Your account can be handled on a commission-only basis, on a fee-only basis or a combination of both.</P>

There are no sales charges with fee-based investing. The fees are consistent, allowing you to know your costs in advance. </P>
<P>FAFN makes available three levels of service to investors who want a screened portfolio. All three levels include portfolio management and investment research reflecting the individual's personal social investment concerns. The three levels are primarily distinguished by the individuals need for tax, retirement and estate planning, or the frequency of adjustments to the portfolio.</P>
<P>The three categories of service are <B>Basic</B>, <B>Personalized</B>, and <B>Custom</B>.</P>
<P><B>The Basic Service </B> is designed for the client who desires a portfolio reflecting his/her personal beliefs; semi-annual reviews and possible adjustments to the portfolio as needed.</P>
<P><B>The Personalized Service </B> will integrate tax, investment and financial planning needs, and reviews on a quarterly basis.</P>
<P><B>The Custom Service </B> is recommended for investors with more than $150,000 under management who may desire/require day-to-day management. The Custom service also integrates a detailed review of resources, goals, tax ramifications, cash flows, etc.</P>
<P>FAFN is affiliated with Walnut Street Securities, Inc. (WSS), broker/dealer in St. Louis, MO. and a member of the NASD and SIPC. All security activities are processed through and supervised by WSS. Walnut Street actively cooperates with FAFN advisors in their mission to provide sound advice and professional services in the area of social investing.</P>
<P>In 1994, FAFN announced it is developing Social-Trak, a socially responsible investment software compatible with Microsoft Windows. Social-Trak will provide in one format complete research information from Morningstar / CD Rom on 34 socially responsible mutual funds.

<img src = "/greenbar.gif" alt = "The GreenMoney On-Line Guide">
<H3>CELESTIAL SEASONINGS</H3>
<P>An overview of Celestial Seasonings Inc. offers a view of sustained success. Here are a few of the highlights: The company...</P>
<OL>
<LI>has developed and popularized the herbal tea category in the U.S. as a flavorful and non-caffeinated alternative to other hot beverages. They are the largest manufacturer and marketer of herbal tea in the U.S.</LI>
<LI>manufactures and markets iced herb tea, specialty black tea, specialty black iced tea, instant tea and ready-to-drink iced tea that contain high-quality, all-natural ingredients with no artificial preservatives.</LI>
<LI>sells products in substantially all of the major supermarkets, grocery stores and natural foods markets in the U.S. and Canada, as well as in 25 countries around the world.</LI>
<LI>is opening up new channels for product consumption in restaurants, hotels, hospitals, wholesale clubs, mass merchandisers, drugstore and convenience stores the world over.</LI>
<LI>sold over one billion cups of Celestial Seasonings tea last year, helping sales for fiscal 1994 jump 10% over fiscal 1993 to $65 million. International sales totaled $5.7 million in 1994.</LI>
<LI>stock is traded on the NASDAQ market [Symbol: CTEA].</LI>
</OL>
<P>Let's see what else the tea leaves say about this company...</P>
<H4>MISSION STATEMENT </H4>
<P>"Our mission is to grow and dominate the U.S. specialty tea market by exceeding consumer expectations with: The best tasting, 100% natural hot and iced teas, packaged with Celestial art and philosophy, creating the most valued tea experience.</P>
<P>Through leadership, innovation, focus, and teamwork we are dedicated to continuously improving value to our consumers, customers, employees, and stakeholders with a quality-first organization."</P>
<H4>THE COMPANY </H4>
<P>Their doors opened in 1970 with one product, Mo's 24 Herb Tea. As the product line increased so did the annual sales, reaching $1 million by 1974. The sales &amp; product lines continued growing and the company was sold to Kraft in 1984. Kraft brought in marketing research, advertising and cash which helped increase revenues to $45 million. Kraft then sold the company back to a group of Celestial Seasonings management, returning the company to independent ownership in 1988. Co-founder, Mo Siegel returned as Chairman and CEO in 1991 after 6 years away. Since returning, he has rejuvenated new-product development, consistently increased sales and earnings, and aggressively strengthened top management. Mr. Siegel is active in every phase of the company from packaging to tasting new products.</P>
<P>In 1993, Celestial Seasonings completed its initial public offering of common stock, raising $38 million. A second stock offering was completed in 1994. The growth in sales is continuing. Projected sales for fiscal year 1995 (period ending Sept. 30, 1995) is $70-75 million.</P>
<P>To grow and revolutionize the tea industry is the dream - few doubt the potential. At the heart of the potential are their customers. Celestial Seasonings puts their customers at the heart of their company. They listen, a lot, letting 80,000 consumers a year taste test their products and give the company feedback. They list a customer service phone line on every product package, (800) 351-8175. Distinctive product packaging with original art and thought-provoking quotations embody the company's efforts to communicate its dedication to excellence in serving its customers. </P>
<H4>THE PRODUCTS</H4>
<P>Herbal hot teas accounted for approximately 84% of the company's 1994 fiscal year sales. Yet herbal hot tea is only 13% of the $2 billion overall tea market. There is room for growth. Celestial Seasonings has 54% of the overall herbal tea market and 31% of the specialty black tea market, but only a small percentage of the traditional black tea market. Expanding beyond herbal hot teas, they now offer herbal and black refrigerator brewed, after dinner, ready-to-drink and specialty hot teas.</P>
<P>The company has a high level of brand awareness among tea drinkers and the company is committed to the continued development of high-quality, flavorful natural products as well as attractive, colorful and thought-provoking packaging.</P>
<P>Their most popular teas include Lemon &amp; Red Zinger.</P>
<P>Their six caffeinated black teas have a caffeine meter on the box to let the consumer know what they're in for. Products like Sgt. Puckers or Waikiwi Peach are iced teas with caffeine, showing the expansion into new areas.</P>
<P>Recently reintroduced are several enhanced tea blends such as Strawberry Kiwi and Orange Mango Zinger. The product line is expanding with new and imaginative flavors like Misty Mango and Harvest Spice.</P>
<P>They are bringing excitement to the world of black tea with flavors like Ceylon Apricot Ginger and Vanilla Maple. Their "After Dinner&amp;quot; tea flavors include Vanilla Hazelnut and English Toffee.</P>
<P>To handle these expanding product lines the manufacturing plant in Boulder, CO recently expanded capacity by one third. With $1.6 million spent on equipment, they now produce more than 1.8 billion tea bags a year. Their commitment to quality is reflected in their manufacturing theme: zero defects, zero waste. </P>
<H4>THE EMPLOYEES </H4>
<P>Currently the company has a workforce of approximately 220 employees. The company offers medical insurance programs that cover 70-90% of the employees' costs with benefits available to any domestic partners. Bonuses occur on Christmas, Thanksgiving and birthdays. The company offers a stock purchase program, 401K plan (with a socially responsible investment option), gain-sharing and educational reimbursement. Employees are involved in two annual all-employee meetings, annual opinion surveys, and they've help write and approve the company's mission statement. </P>
<H4>THE ENVIRONMENT </H4>
<P>Celestial Seasonings develops natural products that nurture people's bodies and uplift their souls. That spirit also extends to our environment. Their environmentally efficient packaging includes: unbleached wax paper box liners, cardboard boxes made from recycled paper board and 100% Oxygen Bleached tea bags that have no staples, strings, tags or foil. Their headquarters has establish internal recycling programs for paper, aluminum, glass, cardboard and burlap. They use all recycled paper office products. </P>
<H4>1995 </H4>
<P>In January, they commenced the manufacturing and marketing of their ready-to-drink (bottled) iced tea upon termination of their licensing agreement with Perrier Group of America. The products have been reformulated and will be distributed in selected markets in 1995 as the company enters new agreements with co-packers and independent beverage distributors. The ready-to-drink market is big, over $500 million in annual sales. Test marketing has also begun on three flavors of a new Iced Tea mix.</P>
<P>In April, they signed a distribution agreement with Japan's UCC Coffee Co. to bring more Celestial Seasonings teas into Japan. They are also working on a joint venture agreement to distribute in Mexico.</P>
<P>Celestial Seasonings is looking to expand their product line to include beverages outside the tea category. Over the next several years the company will grow into a multi-brand, packaged goods company. To help them achieve their goal of being a $200 million company, they will be looking to acquire other companies.</P>
<P>New product &amp; acquisition: Celestial Seasonings Soothers herbal throat drops, in a licensing arrangement with Warner-Lambert. The three current flavors are: honey-lemon chamomile, harvest cherry and herbal orange spice.</P>
<P>In June, Celestial Seasonings acquired Botalia Pharmaceutical Inc., a developer and marketer of herbal supplements and Mo Siegel was named Rocky Mountain region -Entrepreneur of the Year. </P>
<H4>THE FUTURE </H4>
<P>The company faces an intense wave of competition from Lipton, Bigelow, Good Earth, Stash, Snapple, Nestea, Tetly, Republic of Tea, and even Starbucks, all wanting to be<I> your</I> cup of tea. Currently, Celestial Seasonings is the number two player in the U.S. tea business with an 11% market share. Lipton is number one with 39% of the market.</P>
<P>The main differences between Celestial Seasonings and the other companies are long-term product awareness (25 years in the business), and their (truly!) all natural ingredients and worldwide sourcing of those ingredients.</P>
<P>The future means growth in new products, new customers, new channels, and new markets. The company has set ambitious goals for product quality, sales growth, employee productivity and operating profits. Four areas they'll focus on: (1) maintain leadership in hot herbal tea, (2) building better black tea presence, (3) working hard to expand iced tea volume, (4) working with other companies to leverage brand name equity. </P>
<H4>IN CLOSING </H4>
<P>Celestial Seasonings constantly maintains high quality standards, revamps products, creates exciting new flavors, redesigns packaging for high impact, and develops new distribution channels while providing solid financial performance for its shareholders.</P>
<P>For more information on the company, their products or a 1994 Annual Report call (303) 530-5300. When in Boulder take their free manufacturing facilities tour. This tour has welcomed over 100,000 visitors so far and runs six days a week.</P>

Starbucks Coffee Profile</TITLE></HEAD><BODY

bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<H3>STARBUCKS COFFEE COMPANY </H3>

<P>&quot;Starbucks is rekindling America's love affair with

coffee, bringing back romance and fresh flavor.&quot;</P>

<P>Starbucks Coffee Company is North America's leading

roaster and retailer of specialty coffees. Headquartered in

Seattle, WA., Starbucks has more than 400 retail stores and

26 major airport locations. Store locations include:

Washington, Illinois, British Columbia, Oregon, Colorado,

California, Washington DC, Minnesota, Maryland, Virginia,

Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. They

operate a national direct mail business and serve fine

restaurants, Nordstroms, Barnes &amp; Noble bookstores, ITT

Sheraton Hotels, Delta Shuttle (East Coast) and Horizon

Airlines. During 1994 Starbucks also acquired the Coffee

Connection stores.</P>

<P>Currently, Starbucks offers customers 50 varieties of the

world's finest arabica coffee beans. Over two million people

a week drink Starbucks coffee, helping sales for fiscal 1994

total $285 million. Starbucks Coffee stock is publicly traded

on the NASDAQ (Symbol: SBUX). In 1994, the stock price rose

24 percent. (Visit a Starbucks store or order from their

catalog, get to know the company and its products before

investing). </P>

<H4>THE MISSION STATEMENT:</H4>

<P>&quot;Establish Starbucks as the premier purveyor of the

finest coffee in the world while maintaining our

uncompromising principles as we grow. The following five

guiding principles will help us measure the appropriateness

of our decisions:</P>

<P>1.) Provide a great work environment and treat each other

with respect and dignity. 2.) Apply the highest standards of

excellence to the purchasing, roasting and fresh delivery of

our coffee. 3.) Develop enthusiastically satisfied customers

all of the time. 4.) Contribute positively to our communities

and our environment. 5.) Recognize that profitability is

essential to our future success.&quot; </P>

<H4>THE ENVIRONMENTAL MISSION STATEMENT:</H4>

<P>Starbucks' strong commitment to the environment is guided

by an environmental committee. The company endeavors to offer

an environmentally safe product, as it believes that the

welfare of people, planet and product are linked.</P>

<P>The Starbucks Environmental Mission Statement:

&quot;Starbucks is committed to a role of environmental

leadership in all facets of our business. We will fulfill

this mission by a commitment to:</P>

<UL><LI>Understanding of environmental issues and sharing

information with our partners (employees).<BR></LI>

<LI>Developing innovative and flexible solutions to bring

about change.<BR></LI>

<LI>Striving to buy, sell and use environmentally friendly

products.<BR></LI>

<LI>Recognizing that fiscal responsibility is essential to

our environmental future.<BR></LI>

<LI>Instilling environmental responsibility as a corporate

value.<BR></LI>

<LI>Measuring and monitoring our progress for each

project.<BR></LI>

<LI>Encouraging all partners to share in our mission.&quot;

</LI>

</UL>

<P>Starbucks is constantly examining every aspect of their

business by looking at ways to reduce, re-use and recycle.

Here is a sampling of their environmental activities:</P>

<UL><LI>All stores are equipped with special water

purification systems to insure your coffee is free of

contaminants. They sell and encourage use of water filters

and constantly promote the use of brewing methods that avoid

the use of paper filters: including French press, gold

filters and espresso machines.</LI>

<LI>All company paper products are made of recycled paper

wherever possible; including paper bags and boxes, all

catalogues and brochures, publications and letterhead. Paper

cups and coffee filters are made from oxygen-whitened (rather

than chlorine-bleached) paper, which does not release dioxins

into the environment.</LI>

<LI>A wide selection of re-usable, inexpensive thermal cups

are offered at all stores, and a discount is offered to

encourage their use. Re-use of coffee bags is also

encouraged, and rewarded with the same discount.</LI>

<LI>Individual stores are encourage to pursue recycling

arrangements appropriate for their specific location. Many

stores recycle milk cartons and waste paper, and several

compost coffee grounds for the use of local gardeners.</LI>

<LI>They are currently exploring comprehensive, store-wide

recycling programs that would include all paper goods, milk

cartons, and spent coffee grounds. They are also testing

bio-degradable coffee bag materials.</LI>

</UL>

<P>The company's policy to &quot;recycle and conserve

wherever possible&quot; is exemplified by the 10 cent

discount it provides to customers who reduce waste by using

their own mugs or refillable coffee bags. Starbucks offers

these discounts to help stimulate environmental

responsibility amongst its customers. Inevitably, paper

products are used, but Starbucks has insured that paper from

their inert non-toxic, poly-lined paper cups are recyclable

where state/city programs are in place.</P>

<P>The company's environmental conscience extends to its

emphasis on and support of, sustainable, responsible and

organic agriculture methods. Starbucks' concern for avoidance

of petro-chemical based insecticides and fertilizers is an

example of how the company supports the &quot;double bottom

line&quot; concept of stakeholder responsibility. Organic

farming is not only beneficial for the environment, but

protects the workers' health, as well as the safety and

quality of the coffee consumed here. So far, the company has

yet to offer a line of organic coffee.</P>

<P>Starbucks buys from coffee-producing regions around the

world, most of which are developing countries. According to

Starbucks, their Vice President of coffee Dave Olsen has a

personal relationship with the coffee plantation owners in an

effort to support workers' rights as well as maintain good

water quality and support smaller farms. </P>

<H4>COMMUNITIES:</H4>

<P>In further accordance to Starbucks' mission to contribute

positively to communities and our environment, the company

has become the largest corporate sponsor of the international

aid and relief organization, CARE. Programs developed through

Starbucks' partnership with CARE work towards reducing

malnutrition in Guatemala, supporting education and literacy

programs in Kenya, and lowering mortality rate of children in

Indonesia.</P>

<P>Dedicated to active support of the communities in which

it operates, Starbucks helps organizations that benefit

children's welfare, AIDS outreach, and environmental

awareness. They are also involved in a variety of community

cultural events, including jazz and film festivals. The

company donates post-dated coffee to homeless shelters and

hospices in every market. </P>

<H4>THE EMPLOYEES:</H4>

<P>Starbucks' belief that they are in the &quot;people

development&quot; business as much as the coffee business is

clearly expressed through their non-discrimination policy

with respect to age, sexual orientation, race, presence of

handicap, or veteran status. There is a recognized lack of

racial pluralism in their workforce of 6500, but they have

hired a diversity manager as part of an attempt to improve

the situation.</P>

<P>The Starbucks mission statement, while recognizing the

need for profitability, pledges that the company will make

decisions that foster &quot;respect and dignity&quot; in the

workplace. Each employee becomes part of an extensive

training program that facilitates strong product expertise, a

commitment to customer service, and well-developed

interpersonal skills. Starbucks offers a comprehensive

benefits package to both part- and full-time workers, and

every eligible employee is a partner in the &quot;Bean

Stock&quot; ownership plan. </P>

<H4>THE STORES:</H4>

<P>Their goal in each store is to offer superior service to

their customers while educating them about coffee quality. In

our personal research of stores around the country, we've

found this to be true. The information section in each store

is a good resource for becoming more knowledgeable about the

world of coffee. They publish a monthly newsletter, <I>Coffee

Matters</I>, and carry a wide selection of brochures on the

subject including brewing coffee at home, caffeine, espresso

and worldwide sourcing of coffee. Each store offers packaged

goods, fresh-baked pastries and specialty merchandise from

grinders to coffee makers. </P>

<H4>FUTURE PLANS:</H4>

<P>Pepsi Cola and Starbucks Coffee formed a partnership in

1994 to develop ready-to-drink coffee-based beverages.

Development has begun on the high-quality, innovative coffee

beverages with test marketing schedule for this year. The

beverages will be bottled and sold in the same outlets as

Pepsi-Cola soft drinks. New store plans: 200 retail and

airport locations to be opened in 1995 and 1996. The newest

locations are open in Georgia and Texas. Next retail stores

scheduled to open are in Philadelphia and Las Vegas. Other

plans include building a new roasting and distribution

facility in York, PA. All of this leads to the goal of 1,500

stores by the year 2000. <B>In closing</B>, we recognize the

many feelings about Starbucks around the country. There are

many aspects to being socially responsible in today's world;

you have to make your own decisions and move forward with

that knowledge. One thing that's for sure, Starbucks has

changed the world of coffee for a long time to come. If

Howard Schultz, President &amp; CEO has his way, Starbucks

will become as much a part of American culture as Levis.</P>

<img src = "/greenbar.gif" alt = "The GreenMoney On-Line Guide">
<H3>SEVENTH GENERATION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>" In our every deliberation, we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations." <I>-From the Great Law of the Iroquois Confederacy</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Preparing to write this article I reviewed the announcement Seventh Generation issued, setting forth the changes made in their new catalog. It dawned on me I may not be the ideal person to review these changes... I consume as little as possible, and though I enjoy looking at diverse products and welcome with open arms the enlargement of Seventh Generation's business I needed to interview experts to gauge the progress. I did that, asking "What do you look for in catalog shopping?" </P>
<P>All replies were succinct: "I want good products and fast access to a someone who can give me more information about the products or products than the catalog (good service), speedy return of damaged goods or goods otherwise in need of return, and variety."</P>
<P>Taking their viewpoints I start from the beginning:</P>
<P>1. Good products and fast access to more information about the products: the products must speak for themselves. We all have a different idea of quality and satisfaction. Service also has a sliding scale of evaluation. I, however, am fairly demanding (8 on a scale of 1 - 10, ten being extremely demanding). Seventh Generation has a service number on the catalog. I called it and though was received by a recorded message, got a company representative in under one minute. That is fast enough for me. </P>
<P>2. On to Seventh Generation's return policy. It is printed on the catalog: No risk guarantee. They give exchanges, credit, or refund for all items. Can't beat that.</P>
<P>3. Variety: Thumbing through the catalog I was attracted to the goods illustrated within. They are the kind of products I associate with a comfortable sustainable life. I was particularly attracted to the "create your own Paleolithic art kit" which includes pigments, slate surfaces, twig brushes and drawing tools. That, my friend, is variety.</P>
<P>To highlight some of Seventh Generation's changes:</P>
<OL>
<LI>competitive pricing </LI>
<LI>improved catalog illustrations </LI>

<H3>THE REPUBLIC OF TEA </H3>
<P>"Tea is not just a beverage but a way of life, and what a way of life it is! Slow down. Pay Attention. Be grateful. Enjoy what you have. Take pleasure in the wonder of being alive." --The Republic of Tea</P>
<P>The Republic of Tea was founded in 1992 with the mission of inspiring a tea revolution. With its motto, sip by sip rather than gulp by gulp, The Republic has set out on a journey to help its citizens discover the unknown virtues of fine full-leaf teas and herbs.</P>
<P>In a world jittery from change, violence, and perhaps too much coffee, they offer a soothing, healthy alternative: a full-line of rare, top quality teas and herbal infusions blended to bring about calm, yet alert state known in other parts of the world as, "Tea Mind."</P>
<P>"Our secret and subversive agenda was to bring Americans to an awareness of "Tea Mind", in which we would all come to appreciate the perfection, the harmony, the natural serenity, and the true aesthetic in every moment and in every natural thing." --The Republic of Tea</P>
<P>The Republic's quest is focused on providing superior quality product: teas that are created in the garden rather than a laboratory. The products offered are a perceptible cut above ordinary "specialty" tea. More than 40 varietals and blends are now available in full-leaf form and round tea bags. They also sell a variety tea making accessories.</P>
<P>Since its inception, the company has earned prestigious awards for its product and packaging, and has received the attention of the most distinguished food, health and business publications in the country. Articles on the company have appeared in <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>Eating Well</I>, <I>Business Week </I> and<I> Fortune</I>. </P>
<P>For more insight into the Tea Mind, they have written two books:</P>
<P><I>The Republic of Tea: How an Idea Becomes a Business, Letters to a Young Zentrepreneur</I> by Mel Ziegler, Bill Rosenzweig and Patricia Ziegler (Currency/ Doubleday, 1992). This book asks, how do you start a successful business that embodies your own soul and economic realities? The zentrepreneur listens carefully to an idea as it evolves into what it wants to be. The Republic of Tea demonstrates as never before that you do not get hold of an idea; you allow it to get hold of you. This insightful correspondence between Mel and Patricia Ziegler, co-founders of Banana Republic, and their friend Bill Rosenzweig chronicles the day-to-day breakthroughs and breakdowns of the creative process: inventing a product, developing a plan, and structuring a business partnership. The book is not just a blueprint for building a great business, but a practical philosophy for living a happy, fulfilled life.</P>
<P>Along the way their letters demystify the joys and terrors of creating a company, the workings of investment capital, the techniques of marketing to consumers immune to traditional marketing approaches, the way to create a business plan that captures the founders' souls as well as the realities of the marketplace.</P>
<P>A favorite quote from the book, "Life and business are different now. Our customers are looking for balance in their lives. They're trying to discover how to have fun without acquiring more material possessions. I see people beginning to express their personal values through their purchasing decisions."</P>
<P><I>The Book of Tea &amp; Herbs: Appreciating the Varietals and Virtues of Fine Tea &amp;amp; Herbs </I> by The Republic of Tea's Ministry of Information (The Cole Group, 1993). This well-illustrated 160-page guide provides practical appreciation for fine teas and herbs. It looks clearly at the whole world of tea.</P>
<P>Bill Rosenweig is now teamed with Ron Rubin, as the Zieglers have moved on from the company. Their mission remains a steadfast commitment to bring about a tea revolution -- inspiring citizens to discover the virtues of the leaf and the sip by sip life. To order either book, receive product information or a copy of their newsletter, Tea Mind Times call (800) 354-5530.</P>

<img src = "/greenbar.gif" alt = "The GreenMoney On-Line Guide">
<H3>GREENWAY PRODUCTS</H3>
<P>Greenway is a company of new environmentally-friendly products for our home environment and our personal environment. Dedicated to making a positive contribution toward a safe and clean environment -- for now and future generations.</P>
<P>The home environment line consists of all-purpose, non-biotoxic cleaners. These include Green Garden Liquid Soap, Kitchen Suds, Automatic Dishwashing Powder, Citrus Clean Spray Cleaner, Laundry Powder, Oxygen Bleach, Organic Stain &amp; Odor Treatment. These environmentally-sensitive household cleaners, use all vegetable-and-fruit-based extracts and other ingredients that biodegrade harmlessly in the natural environment within three days. Several of the products are based on Grapefruit seed extract because it is a natural substance that boosts cleaning power, safely controls mildew stains and odors, yet is gentle and soothing to the skin. According to Jim Whittaker, founder of Greenway, "the soap is safe enough to wash your dishes, and your dog, with waste water that can be poured on your garden." </P>
<P>To conserve packaging the products are sold in highly concentrated form which brings the price per use to equal that of name-brand cleaners.</P>
<P>The personal environment line is called Gaea, for the Greek-goddess of the Earth. It includes Bath Gel, Aromatherapy Bath Oil, Body Oil, Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, Bath Bars, Hydrating Body Lotion. This line of products complies with company's stringent environmental requirements. The products contain no petroleum, harmful dyes or anything of animal origin, they are cruelty free and made with the purest ingredients such as coconut, palm and olive oils, chamomile flowers, lavender, lemon grass and eucalyptus.</P>
<P>Every product has some impact on the environment. The goal at Greenway is to find the ones that have the least impact on the earth.</P>
<P>Greenway was started in 1991 by Jim Whittaker and Dianne Roberts from their home in Port Townsend, WA. The company combines Jim Whittaker's years in business as the President &amp; CEO of REI and his years in the environment as a world-renowned mountaineer. Jim is known for leading the 1990 Mt. Everest Earth Day International Peace Climb that for the first time brought together climbers from the U.S., China, and the former Soviet Union. Succeeding together on the climb towards peace, they also hauled two tons of trash off the World's highest mountain.</P>
<P>Greenway sells their products using a sales distribution network. This allows the consumers to ask questions and get accurate product information from the distributors. These products give people a chance to make positive differences for themselves and the environment. Currently, Greenway has over 1000 part-time distributors in Oregon, Washington, California and Canada.</P>
<P>One of their main goals at Greenway, is to educate consumers as to the true meaning of environmental claims so they can make more intelligent decisions. It is through offering environmentally responsible products, education and total commitment to the environment that people working together can help preserve the planet.</P>
<P>We all benefit as these types of products are becoming the standard in our marketplace. The more environmentally educated we are, the easier it is to make informed, responsible consumer decisions.</P>
<P>To find out more about Greenway, it's products or becoming a distributor call (800) 966-1445.</P>
<P>"We think the environment consists of four parts: the person first, their home, the community they live in, and the planet." (Jim Whittaker, Greenway Founder)</P>

Organic Agriculture and Gardening, pt 2</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<H4>INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURE</H4>
<P>Industrialized agriculture has brought us to a critical
cultural and environmental breaking point.</P>
<P>The connection between nature, humans and community is
marginalized by industrial agriculture. Rows of crops uniform
in size, maturing on time, harvested mechanically,
petrochemically fertilized, etc... Nature is controlled at
every turn, even genetically. Currently, and most
disturbingly, the process of determining the legal, patented
ownership of nature is progressing. Profits belong to
corporations. </P>
<P><B>A brief outline of Industrial Agriculture:</B></P>
<UL><LI>The application of fertilizers increase crop yields
dramatically;</LI>
<LI>Chemical pesticides magically eradicate troublesome
pests;</LI>
<LI>Problems are &quot;solved&quot; by the application of a product;</LI>
<LI>Farming becomes dependent on mass produced seeds and
chemicals;</LI>
<LI>Convenience replaces wisdom;</LI>
<LI>Soil health declines;</LI>
<LI>More and more chemicals are developed and applied;</LI>
<LI>Farm and factory workers expose to pesticides face
health hazards;</LI>
<LI>Insects evolve to resist the pesticides;</LI>
<LI>Stronger chemicals are developed;</LI>
<LI>Expensive equipment is purchased to apply the chemicals -- farmer debt
grows;</LI>
<LI>Profits go to corporations; and</LI>
<LI> Industrial agriculture works for a while and America
becomes the breadbasket of the world.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Poor soil health allows erosion. With the eroding soil
travels chemical residue. As topsoil drains (or is blown)
away, the ground becomes hardpan. Compensating fertilizers
are applied destroying essential microbes. As soil health is
compromised plants weaken. More pesticides are applied to
control infestations. These inputs and the soil itself become
major pollutants. This is environmentally un-sound and an
economic disaster.</P>
<P><B>Currently:</B></P>
<UL><LI>&quot;Farming&quot; as an occupation has been dropped by the U.S. Census Bureau.
In 1950, 12% of the U.S. population were farmers. In 1995,
only 2%;</LI>
<LI>Since 1945, we've lost 108 million acres of productive
U.S. agricultural land annually -- a total of 4.85 billion acres
worldwide;</LI>
<LI>The U.S. has lost approximately half our topsoil in the
last twenty years. Every pound of food produced costs six
pounds of topsoil; and</LI>
<LI>More than 2 million acres of U.S. eroded agricultural
land is abandoned each year.</LI>
</UL>
<P>All agricultural chemical waste goes somewhere. That
&quot;somewhere&quot; is often in our drinking
water. Federal Drinking Water standards (based on a yearly
average exposure) are enforced allowing contamination levels
to exceed &quot;safe&quot; levels. Columbus, Ohio found six different
weed killers in a single sample of tap water on July 3, 1995.
Columbus was found to consistently violate safe water
standards. The city was granted an exemption from compliance -- as long as they
informed the public.</P>
<P>In food, a single detection of residue exceeding limits
is a violation of federal law. </P>
<P><B>About Pesticides: </B></P>
<UL><LI>The term &quot;pesticides&quot; includes insecticides, herbicides and
fungicides;</LI>
<LI>EPA records show the amount of pesticides on U.S. food
escalated from 300 million pounds in 1960 to more than 800
million pounds in 1993;</LI>
<LI>Corn receives more herbicides, insecticides, and
chemical fertilizers than any other U.S. crop. 80% of this
crop becomes animal food; and</LI>
<LI>One out of eight U.S. women gets breast cancer -- a disease linked to
pesticides.</LI>

<P></P>
<H3>REAL GOODS</H3>
<P>The way you heat, cool, and light your home, the home and body products you select, and how you care for your garden are all integral parts of the Real Goods vision defined by the term Solar Living -- it's a lifestyle overhaul, an <B>Eco-renovation</B>. </P>
<H4>MISSION STATEMENT</H4>
<P>"Real Goods is in business to provide knowledge and products to redirect the world toward a sustainable future where all living things are recognized as interconnected. Our merchandise provides tools that facilitate independent living, energy self-sufficiency and that are free of extractive, exploitive and environmental abuse throughout their lifecycles. We encourage and cooperate with businesses, organizations, and individuals throughout the world who share our goals. We strive to generate revenue to provide our employees with viable employment while earning enough profit to maintain the trust of our shareowners. We will nurture a mutually supportive work environment where employees are treated fairly, and are provided with opportunities to express and enact their creativity.</P>
<P>We will accept only the highest standards of customer service, anticipating that the trust that this engenders will be reflected in the continued loyalty of our customers. We will communicate our goals in original, meaningful ways that are both intensely serious and full of fun. Using experimentation, invention, and creative solutions, we will strive to educate through our products, our communications, and our example, that a simple, self-reliant lifestyle is the best way of sustaining the planet's limited resources for future generations." </P>
<H4>THE COMPANY </H4>
<P>The company was started by John Schaeffer in 1978. It took about ten years for people to join in John's vision of a solar future. As the public's sense of environmental awareness increased, Real Good's message was heard by a wider audience. Sales in 1987 were $250,000. By 1991, they were $8 million and Real Goods was on <I>Inc. </I> magazine's list of the fastest growing businesses in America. Sales increased to over $12 million in fiscal year 1993-94. The company continues to refine their mission and work towards a clear path for the company's future. As a catalog company the rise in paper, postage and freight costs has hampered profitability. Still, revenues increased 38% for the fiscal year 1994-95 (period ending March 31, 1995) to $16.3 million. The catalog sales were 84% of total sales - $13.8 million. The company is still experiencing considerable sales growth. The fiscal 94-95 sales are more than double that of just two years ago. Total order volume increased as well last year from 136,000 to 243,000, serving 169,000 mail order and 21,000 retail store customers. To meet the demand they increased full-time staff from 87 to 111.</P>
<P>The company was privately held until 1991 when a limited public offering was made to Real Goods customers. The one million dollar offering needed to finance the company's ongoing growth sold out in short order, and more than $400,000 in surplus funds had to be returned to prospective investors. The company's second public offering of 600,000 shares for a total of $3.6 million was completed in October 1993 and oversold by nearly $1 million. The company's common stock is publicly traded on the Pacific Stock Exchange [Symbol: RGT.P].</P>
<P>The company's future goals include: expansion of retail locations, licensing and franchising, as well as increasing catalog distribution and market share in renewable energy products. </P>
<H4>THE PRODUCTS</H4>
<P>Real Goods is the largest seller of renewable energy products that convert energy from the sun, wind, or water into usable electricity within the home. The company handles more than 3500 products, including photovoltaic panels, efficient lighting products, 12-volt electrical appliances, water conservation devices, non-toxic household products, home office products, tools and natural garden products, casual clothing, and Deja Shoes.</P>
<P>Real Goods merchandise is divided into 12 product categories. The categories are: Living, Land, Shelter, Harvesting Energy, Managing Energy, Heating and Cooling, Water, Mobility, Conservation, Safer Living, Gardening, Learning &amp; Livelihood. </P>
<P>The company's slogan is "Knowledge is our most important product," and Real Goods lives up to the statement by providing its customers with extensive information. Educational material is contained in all the company publications and is also provided personally via an experienced staff of trained technicians.</P>
<P>Color catalogs highlight merchandise of seasonal interest. New products and exciting developments in technology are featured in the <I>Real Goods News</I>, a periodical which chronicles the important happenings in the world of independent living. </P>
<H4>PUBLICATIONS</H4>
<P>The Real Goods message is fully told in the company's <I>Solar Living Sourcebook</I>, a compendium of articles, product information, and philosophy that collectively summarizes the state of independent living. Currently in its eighth edition, the <I>Sourcebook </I>has products and extensive reference materials on renewable energy technologies, and is distributed in 44 English speaking countries.</P>
<P>The heart of the company's customer base, however, is spread across the United States and Canada, encompassing a cross-section of independent thinkers whose lifestyles and viewpoints are given prominent display in the company's <I>Real Goods News</I>, a publication in which the soapbox is routinely turned over to the readers. <I>RG News </I> also has quarterly updates for the <I>Solar Living Sourcebook </I> with all the latest developments in the world of energy independence. The Real Stuff is a quarterly newsletter for loyal shareholder and members of the Real Goods Hard Corps. </P>
<P>On the business front, the company's growth has been based on its seasonal color catalogs (Real Goods &amp; Earthcare paper). More than seven million catalogs are circulated annually. The company services its customers from a modern facility in Hopland, CA and retail stores in Amherst, WI, Eugene, OR and Hopland, CA. Over 110 full-time employees supplemented by seasonal help staff phone lines, answers letters, and ship orders for independent dwellers worldwide.</P>
<P>Other business co-ventures: Real Goods has begun co-publishing the <I>Independent Living </I> Book Series with Chelsea Green publishing. The company is working with the Millennium Whole Earth Catalog filling book &amp; product orders. </P>
<H4>THE INSTITUTE FOR SOLAR LIVING</H4>
<P>The Institute exists to educate consumers about the capabilities and proper use of renewable energy technologies. Both weekend and weeklong session are offered across the U.S. Call the Institute registrar at Real Goods for the dates and locations. </P>
<H4>SOLAR LIVING CENTER</H4>
<P>Real Good's most ambitious long term goal is the development of the Solar Living Center in Hopland, CA. The site is scheduled to open in 1996 and will be used to educate and increase awareness of the necessity for sustainable development and renewable energy production. Their goal is to have 40,000 visitors a year at the center. Visitors will see a working model of restorative, sustainable building practices, renewable energy systems and sustainable agriculture. The center, which will also be the company's world headquarters is being built with sustainably harvested materials, including the use of straw bales in several walls. It will be powered by a large photovoltaic solar array and wind generators. Grand Opening is scheduled for September 21, 1995. In 1996, tours of the site will officially begin and in 1997, the building of a totally off-the-grid solar demonstration home will take place. </P>
<H4>NATIONAL TOUR OF INDEPENDENT HOMES</H4>
<P>Each year Real Goods provides their customers with the opportunity to visit homes around the country that feature renewable energy systems, interesting building techniques, and the people who have turned their dreams into reality. The next home tour is October 14, 1995. There will be over two hundred homes on display around the country. The event has attracted over 20,000 attendees and the national media. For locations of the homes call Real Goods.</P>
<P>The company is also creating a Demonstration Homes program, beginning with 50 homes, and growing to 500 homes across the U.S. Visitors see model homes, both on and off the grid, that incorporate many aspects of energy efficiency and environmental awareness. They will also be able to speak to the knowledgeable homeowners. For information contact Karen Hensley at Real Goods. </P>
<H4>IN CLOSING</H4>
<P>Real Goods meets its responsibility to shareowners, customers, employees and community by enabling cooperation and mutual prosperity to coexist with healthy and fair competition. By valuing each individual and by caring about a healthy future for the Earth they may be "off the grid" but we think they're on the right track. </P>

<HR>
<P>
Environmental responsibility enhances shareholder value.  Winslow believes that environmental responsibility and economic gain are compatible goals and that developing a proactive strategy for achieving environmental quality will enhance a firm's profitability.  The core of Winslow's investment philosophy is that well managed, environmentally responsible companies minimize their environmental risks while enjoying competitive advantages from cost reductions, quality improvements, sustainable product development, margin expansion, and revenue growth through access to expanding and new
markets.
<P>
Environmentally sound companies share the following definition of quality: they
follow a set of environmental criteria integrated into their business and supported
by monitoring and control mechanisms, and their operations minimize the use of
resources and the environmental impact. Companies that combine sound
environmental quality management with competent business management are
sought by the firm. Winslow invests in companies that have incorporated pollution prevention into their operations and are designing products with recyclability in mind.  Companies in the portfolio are either
environmentally proactive, "best in class," or environmentally benign. Some
Winslow investments are environmental turnarounds and most, if not all, are socially
responsible.
<P>
To satisfy the environmental discipline, every company must pass
the Winslow environmental screening process. The research process includes
reviewing company documents, meeting with management, conducting site
visits, and contacting relevant regulatory agencies and environmental
organizations.  In addition to environmental review, fundamental analysis is vital to the
Winslow decision-making process. Winslow seeks equity investments in
responsible companies that demonstrate: high or improving profitability; strong
or improving financial position; revenue, earnings, and unit growth; adequate
cash flow to finance their operations; management ownership; and potential
returns that are positive and greater than the market. Quantitative screening and
technical analysis are also important disciplines in Winslow's stock selection
process.

<H4>100% Hemp Message!Covers are an Attractive Alternative</H4>
<P>The all-natural checkbook cover is made with 100% hemp.
It is undyed, rugged, biodegradable and washable. Hemp grows
easily without the use of chemical pesticides, herbicides or
fungicides. It's an annual crop with fibers that are
<I>twice</I> as long as wood fiber. It is extremely durable,
yet lightweight and attractive. For duplicate checks, we've
added a removable 100% post-consumer cardboard flap.</P>
<P><BR> </P>
<H4><B>Hemp makes sense</B></H4>
<P>Hemp was an indispensable part of world commerce for over
6,000 years. Its versatility surpasses the cotton plant, the
Douglas fir, and the soybean. Hemp can be used to produce
over 25,000 products - from inks, papers, solvents,
insulation and fuel, to fabrics, oils and cosmetics. Houses
have been built using <I>only</I> hemp and copper. And, with
the high demand for fiber, our decreasing forests, and
staggering increases in world population, hemp provides a
wise alternative to a future in crisis.</P>
<P><BR> </P>
<H4><B>Do Good While Looking Good</B></H4>
<P>Over 10% of the price of each cover goes to support an
organization you believe in. Your beautiful Message!Cover
makes a statement and supports the protection of our oceans,
our parks, our forests, our wildlife, and our social
well-being. The first checkbook cover <I>ever</I> to be
socially and environmentally responsible!</P>
<P><BR> <DL> <B>2 digit code =HC</B><DD>Price: $11.95 for
single or duplicate style<DD><I>Please specify on the order
form which organizaiton you'd like to benefit from the sale.

<H4>PRINCIPLES / STANDARDS / INITIATIVES: </H4>
<P>The following Principles and resources are guiding
business people to increased awareness of their impact around
the world. Part of this impact is the clear message it sends
investors about corporate values. We've included several sets
of Principles, each promoting sustainable local and global
business.</P>
<P>The <B>CERES Principles</B> are a ten-point code of
conduct on companies' environmental performance and
accountability. A company that endorse the CERES Principles
pledges to monitor and improve its behavior in the following
areas: protecting the biosphere, sustainable use of natural
resources, reduction and disposal of wastes, energy
conservation, risk reduction, safe products and services,
environmental restoration, informing the public, and
management commitments. Companies must also report on their
progress with these pledges. This information is included in
the annual CERES Report, which is available to the public.
</P>
<P>The CERES Principles have been endorsed by six Fortune
500 companies - Sun Oil, General Motors, Polaroid, Arizona
Public Service, H.B. Fuller, and Bethlehem Steel along with
more than 60 small to mid-sized companies. For more
information and a copy of the Principles call (617) 451-0927.
</P>
<CENTER><H4>The CERES Principles </H4>
</CENTER><P>Introduction</P>
<P>By adopting these Principles, we publicly affirm our
belief that corporations have a responsibility for the
environment, and must conduct all aspects of their business
as responsible stewards of the environment by operating in a
manner that protects the Earth. We believe that corporations
must not compromise the ability of future generations to
sustain themselves.</P>
<P>We will update our practices constantly in light of
advances in technology and new understandings in health and
environmental science. In collaboration with CERES, we will
promote a dynamic process to ensure that the Principles are
interpreted in a way that accommodates changing technologies
and environmental realities. We intend to make consistent,
measurable progress in implementing these Principles and to
apply them to all aspects of our operations throughout the
world.</P>
<P>Principles</P>
<P><I>Protection of the Biosphere</I></P>
<P>We will reduce and make continual progress toward
eliminating the release of any substance that may cause
environmental damage to the air, water, or the earth or its
inhabitants. We will safeguard all habitats affected by our
operations and will protect open spaces and wilderness, while
preserving biodiversity.</P>
<P><I>Sustainable Use of Natural Resources</I></P>
<P>We will make sustainable use of renewable natural
resources, such as water, soils, and forests. We will
conserve nonrenewable natural resources through efficient use
and careful planning.</P>
<P><I>Reduction and Disposal of Wastes</I></P>
<P>We will reduce and where possible eliminate waste through
source reduction and recycling. All waste will be handled and
disposed of through safe and responsible methods.</P>
<P><I>Energy Conservation</I></P>
<P>We will conserve energy and improve the energy efficiency
of our internal operations and of the goods and services we
sell. We will make every effort to use environmentally safe
and sustainable energy sources.</P>
<P><I>Risk Reduction</I></P>
<P>We will strive to minimize ,the environmental, health and
safety risks to our employees and the communities in which we
operate through safe technologies, facilities and operating
procedures, and by being prepared for emergencies.</P>
<P><I>Safe Products and Services</I></P>
<P>We will reduce and where possible eliminate the use,
manufacture or sale of products and services that cause
environmental damage or health or safety hazards. We will
inform our customers of the environmental impacts of our
products or services and try to correct unsafe use.</P>
<P><I>Environmental Restoration</I></P>
<P>We will promptly and responsibly correct conditions we
have caused that endanger health, safety or the environment.
To the extent feasible, we will redress injuries we have
caused to persons or damage we have caused to the environment
and will restore the environment.</P>
<P><I>Informing the Public</I></P>
<P>We will inform in a timely manner everyone who may be
affected by conditions caused by our company that might
endanger health, safety or the environment. We will regularly
seek advice and counsel through dialogue with persons in
communities near our facilities. We will not take any action
against employees for reporting dangerous incidents or
conditions to management or to appropriate authorities.</P>
<P><I>Management Commitment</I></P>
<P>We will implement these Principles and sustain a process
that ensures that the Board of Directors and Chief Executive
Officer are fully informed about pertinent environmental
issues and are fully responsible for environmental policy. In
selecting our Board of Directors, we will consider
demonstrated environmental commitment as a factor.</P>
<P><I>Audits and Reports</I></P>
<P>We will conduct an annual self-evaluation of our progress
in implementing these Principles. We will support the timely
creation of generally accepted environmental audit
procedures. We will annually complete the CERES Report, which
will be made available to the public.</P>

<HR>

<H4>1995</H4>

<P>1995 saw many changes in the SRI industry as well as several significant events. </P>

<H5>Industry Highlights of 1995:</H5>

<P>&#149; First Affirmative Financial Network, Social Investment Organization of Canada, and Resourceful Women all held SRI conferences. Business for Social Responsibility, Students for Responsible Business, and Eco Expo held conferences with sessions on SRI.</P>

<H4>Other Significant Events of 1995:</H4>

<P>&#149; MADD- Mothers against Drunk Driving had its 15th Anniversary</P>

<P>&#149; Habitat for Humanity built its 40,000th home.</P>

<P>&#149; The Tobacco industry got lit up by its shareholders, the media, and the FDA. </P>

<P>&#149; Several small socially responsible companies initiated public stock offerings in 1995. They included:</P>

<P>	Earth Trade - promotes sustainable development by marketing both organic and conventional food products from farm cooperatives in the developing world.</P>

<P>	 Annie's Homegrown - sells a line of totally-natural macaroni and cheese products (no additives or dyes).	</P>

<P>	Blue Fish Clothing Co. - Sells a line of organic clothing with hand block art prints.</P>

<P>	Thanksgiving Coffee Co. - Sells a line of coffee and teas.</P>

<P>	Doing another stock offering was Odwalla, the all natural juice company.</P>

<P>	&#149; Targeted Community Investments (TCI) were created in 1995 as a new, high-impact/fixed-rate investment fund administered by the Calvert Foundation. The program will lend money for economic development and housing in rural and urban communities where capital is difficult to obtain from traditional sources. The foundation will support organizations that work toward helping disadvantaged members of society become self-sufficient. Investors will purchase the TCI notes from the Calvert Foundation for 1, 3, or 5 years and are available in amounts over $1000 at a fixed interest rate just below money market rates. For more information call (800) 248-0337. They hope to raise $50 million over the next five years. </P>

<P>	&#149; The Social Investment Forum (SIF) and Co-op America Business Network merged in 1995 with the goal of providing the industry practitioners with a powerful new set of benefits. The two organizations will serve two distinct roles within the new framework:</P>

<P>	Co-op America Business Network's role is to provide core membership services and expand social investing public education and outreach to broaden and deepen the social investment industry.</P>

<P>	The Forum's role will be to provide leadership and to provide members with conferencing, research, professional education and advocacy benefits.</P>

<P>	From the combined organization:</P>

<P> 	- The new 1996 membership guide </P>

<P> 	- The 1997 National Green Pages </P>

<P> 	- Social investment education campaign</P>

<P> 	- Social investing web site </P>

<P> 	- SRI section in all Co-op America publications</P>

<P> 	- Dual membership in Co-op America and SIF.</P>

<P>	In addition, Eric Smith, CFP in Seattle, WA is coordinating a e-mail discussion group for Social Investment Forum members. He can be reached by e-mail at erics@goodfunds.com or by phone at (206) 448-7737.</P>

<P>	Co-op America has dramatically increased their focus on responsible (integrative) investing. The Spring 1995 issue of Co-op America Quarterly was dedicated to SRI. They also published two responsible investing handbooks. To order a free copy of the Financial Planning Handbook for Responsible Investors, with information on tax-saving tips, women and investing, and how to shop for financial services call (800) 713-8086.</P>

<P>	In September 1995, the SIF released a research paper "After South Africa: Major Responsible Investment Trends in the U.S." This paper stated there are $639 billion in socially responsible invested assets in the U.S. today, and it authenticates the extent of SRI in the U.S. as well as identifying major post-apartheid trends in the industry. The $639 billion represents 9% of the $7 trillion in money under management in the U.S. today. (Source: Nelson's 1994 Directory of Money Managers). In 1984, that number was only $40 billion. The $639 billion includes mutual funds, dollars held by institutions that sponsored shareholder resolutions in the last two years, privately managed accounts, and community-targeted investments.</P>

<P>	Over 90% of the money managers are screening on three or more issues today. A major shift began in the '80s from traditional "negative" screens to the use of positive criteria and shareholder activism. Some of these screens include human rights, environmental concerns, animal rights and employee relations. </P>

<P>	The most gratifying aspect of this report is the breadth of SRI after the South Africa Divestiture restrictions were lifted. SRI is well ensconced in this business and represents a significant portion of many investment manager's business. A grassroots demand for screened investment services complemented with shareholder activism has positioned the industry to create the changes we are looking for.</P>

<P>	For more information about the study or membership contact: Social Investment Forum at PO Box 57216, Washington, DC 20037 (202) 872-5319.</P>

<P> &#149; The media continued featuring SRI. We saw 45 different publications with articles and/or mentions about SRI; from SmartMoney to Good Money, from EcoTraveler to Swing from Black Enterprise to Enviro. Several major newspapers had articles on SRI including The Wall Street Journal, LA Times, The New York Times and Washington Post. Several TV and radio networks were involved in the Social Investment Forum's "New Number" press conference including NPR &amp; CNN. The Dow Jones News Service now has a person on the SRI beat. During the year we've appreciated the expanded coverage of SRI in Business Ethics magazine with new editor Dale Kurschner. Franklin Insight's Investing for a Better World newsletter has been excellent at covering a wide array of investing issues. </P>

<P><B>SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTING</B></P>
<P>An individual's, or an institution's capital investments often mirror their social, environmental, ethical and political concerns. Social investing, likewise promotes corporate responsibility and can be used to assist investors to meet both their social and financial objectives.</P>
<P><B>Why consider Social Investing?</B></P>
<P>If you, or the institution you represent, are involved in addressing and finding solutions to the numerous environmental, social, ethical, and political problems faced by today's society, you may wish to take a closer look at your investments.</P>
<P>Many people and groups give away not only funds, but their personal time, to affect change and to support worthwhile organizations. They may not realize that they can structure their investment portfolio to support their social goals as well. As an institution, we manage large amounts of stock for many different clients, and can influence corporate managements. This can help make your opinions heard, and can change company policies. At the very least, investors can check to make sure that their investments are not contributing to the very problems they are working so hard to solve. </P>
<P>FinArc, LLC offers screening for ethical investments, at no additional cost. We encourage our clients to decide if they want this service and, if so, what ethical criteria they want us to use in our structuring of their portfolio.</P>
<P><B>Screening Criteria</B></P>
<P>Although our clients' concerns and preferences vary, commonly selected categories for screening out companies include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Major polluters</LI>
<LI>Repressive regimes</LI>
<LI>Defense weaponry manufacturers</LI>
<LI>Poor employee relationships</LI>
<LI>Alcohol manufacturers</LI>
<LI>Tobacco companies</LI>
<LI>Nuclear power producers</LI>

Return</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<HR><CENTER><H2>Market Return &amp; Comment</H2>
</CENTER><HR>
<P>The third quarter was more volatile than any other quarter in recent memory.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down almost 7.50% in July from its May peak.  The drop was attributed to three factors: </P>
<UL><LI>stronger than expected economic reports, which led investors to believe the Federal Reserve Bank would increase short-term interest rates to curb expected higher inflation,</LI>
<LI>poor profit reports from a number of high profile companies,</LI>
<LI>increased pessimism over the durability of the bull market. </LI>
</UL>
<P>Mutual fund redemptions were higher than they had been, and the Dow sank below 5300 in early July.  However, the market has more than recovered the losses over the past two months, mutual fund inflows have picked up again, and the economic data now points to a slower economy. </P>
<H4>INTEREST RATES &amp; INFLATION</H4>
<P>On September 24, the Federal Reserve Bank decided to leave short-term interest rates unchanged.  The conflicting economic reports we have seen for the past few quarters continue and there is no consensus about when the next  cycle will begin.  Job growth and consumer confidence continues strong.  However sales, retail spending and construction have slowed.</P>
<P>Economists expect slower growth in the third quarter, much lower than the 4.7% GDP growth registered in the second quarter.  Most estimates are in the 2.0-2.5% range.  During periods of low unemployment, which now stands at 5.2%, inflation has historically accelerated, as businesses are forced to pay higher wages to attract workers.  Higher wages will lead to higher prices throughout the economy.  Wages have increased lately, and with the $0.50 increase in the minimum wage now in effect, prices should rise.  Consumer and producer price growth are still tame because of the competitiveness in the domestic economy and the free movement of goods between nations, and they should remain so for the next quarter. </P>
 
<P>The Fed elected not to change its interest rate policy, partly because of the lack of price pressures.  However, should the economy fail to slow in the third quarter as expected, inflation will accelerate, and the Fed will likely need to raise short-term interest rates.  Higher interest rates and inflation will mean lower corporate profits and a more difficult stock market environment after the election and into next year.  Keep your eye on prices at the supermarket and in the mall.</P>
<H4>THE ECONOMY &amp; PROFITS</H4>
<P>Corporate profit growth will slow in the second half.  The second half of 1995 was a strong period, and it will be difficult for most companies to match the growth they have seen in the first half.  In addition, margins may be squeezed as wage pressures mount and it becomes more difficult to pass along the costs in the form of higher prices.  Higher fuel prices will affect the transportation sector, and a stronger dollar will hurt United States corporations selling their products overseas.  A number of companies have preannounced weak earnings, and weaker than expected profit reports in the next few weeks will increase market volatility.</P>
<H4>MARKET OUTLOOK</H4>
<P>Stock price volatility and share volume have slowed dramatically in the past few weeks.  We expect the lull to continue for a few weeks until corporate earnings are released.  Any surprises in the election in November would stir up the market as well.  The consensus calls for a Clinton win and the Republicans maintaining a majority in the House, although their majority will be lesser than they have currently.  The strength of stock mutual fund inflows and the inaction by the Fed will provide continued support for the market, and the persistence of this bull market makes investors nervous about holding cash.  As always, we will buy companies that we expect to perform well regardless of the level of the stock market, although it has become more difficult to find such companies of late. </P>

<HR><CENTER><H2>Stock Watch</H2>
</CENTER><HR><P>Not all stocks are appropriate for all
investment portfolios. However, these are some of our
favorite stocks. </P>
<P><B>Boston Technology</B> does voice-mail messaging
systems. The opportunity has been for people who don't have
an answering machine in the United States or wherever. Their
largest clients over the last couple of years have been the
Regional Bell Operating Companies -- like Bell Atlantic and
Bell South. They actually have contracts with five of the
Bell Operating Companies -- so you can call in for a monthly
rate, get your voice-mail messages at the phone company, and
it's very advantageous if you have a cellular phone, you're
driving and you want to check your messages. It's easier than
remembering codes on home answering machines or office
answering machines, and there's a lot more capability in
terms of having access to the system wherever you are.</P>
<P>Where the opportunity is, going forward, however, is
abroad. About two thirds of their revenues are now
international. So in a place like China where there are very
few actual physical telephones around -- and it's almost
impossible to get one even if you want one -- somebody could
go to the local public pay phone, dial into their voice-mail
and communicate with each other. That's an incredible
opportunity, because people want to communicate; and they
just don't have the capability right now. Cellular phone
companies are also moving in there. The wireless market is
growing significantly. And when you don't have a home
answering machine, this is a terrific alternative. It's also
been proven to be more reliable than a lot of the answering
machines. So that's been great.</P>
<P>They have a new system which they're shipping at a huge
rate this year. They're selling them primarily to the
telephone companies who provide the service, and it helps
their margins too.</P>
<P>One new product that Boston Technology has is an Internet
product. If you're in the type of job where you get a lot of
voicemail messages every day. My husband is in that kind of
position -- where he can come back if he's at an all-day
training seminar and have 50 voicemail messages, and he has
to listen through the entire tape to get all of his messages.
This is not very efficient if two of those messages are
urgent and he needs to respond to them immediately. What the
new product does is actually list on your computer screen all
of the voicemail messages. You can identify who it has come
from, the date and the time, and whether it is urgent or not.
So you could come back to your office, look at your screen
and pull out the most important calls that you needed to
make, and then get around to the other ones after you had put
the fire out, so to speak. It makes you more efficient and
responsive. They have not started shipping this product yet,
but they hope to soon. I think that's an incredible
opportunity, and shows that Boston Tech has recognized the
power of the Internet.</P>
<P>The CEO of Boston Technology is one of the partners who
recently bought Prodigy, and I'm sure there are synergies
there. We haven't heard any announcements but this could be
good for both firms.</P>
<P>I see potentially 30 percent upside on Boston Tech's
stock over the next 12 to 18 months, and they might surprise
me by doing better. They're a well-run company.</P>
<P><B>Thermo Instrument</B>, a diversified firm that
designs, manufactures and distributes analytical instuments,
has recently spun out one division, <B>ThermoQuest</B>, and
plans to spin out several others, including
<B>ThermoOptics</B>, and<B> Thermo Bioanalysis</B>. The terms
spin out, were created by the management to indicate that the
new firm would still be part of the mother firm, but would
have an independent identity, management, and strategy.
<B>Thermo Electron</B>, the parent company of <B>Thermo
Instruments</B>, has been very successful using this strategy
which they developed. They continue to own large percentages
of the spinouts, which benefits shareholders, customers, and
employees. The Chief Financial Officer of <B>Thermo
Electron</B>, John Hatsopoulos, continues to advise all the
new spinouts on the best way to finance their operations, and
structure new spinouts. Also, the &quot;babies&quot; get
administration, investor relations services, and financial
clout because of the good ratings of &quot;Mother&quot;
<B>Thermo</B>.</P>
<P>Although these stocks are risky in the short-term, they
have solid businesses and very experienced managers, some of
whom have been running the company for over twenty years. In
addition, the presence of Mother <B>Thermo</B> makes them
less risky than a typical initial public offering.
Nonetheless, we own the parent for some clients, and the
spinout for others, depending on their risk tolerance. We've
been pleased to offer these stocks to our clients and hope
that all will benefit, regardless of which stock they own.

Architects: Charitable giving's hidden
benefits</TITLE></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<HR><CENTER><H2>Charitable giving's hidden benefits.</H2>
</CENTER><HR><P>The benefits of Socially Responsible
Investing have often been discussed on the pages of this
newsletter. For the individuals who want to give something
more back to their communities, though, SRI is often not
enough; that's when planned charitable giving makes
sense.</P>
<P>Anyone who has made a charitable contribution at some
point in their life, is aware of its two direct benefits. One
is the emotional satisfaction that comes with giving to the
needy, and the other is the tax deduction received when
filing tax returns. Although the former is the primary reason
for giving to charity, there exist a number of additional tax
benefits one can receive from an appropriate long-term gift
plan. </P>
<P>Planned charitable giving often has more tax benefits
than a series of unplanned, year-end contributions.
Especially for people with highly appreciated assets, such as
low-cost equities or real estate, funding their gifts through
a long-term, structured plan can shelter them and their heirs
from capital gains taxes. </P>
<P>An individual can donate up to 50% of their adjusted
gross income to charity each year, provided the donation is
in cash. If a donor wishes to gift an appreciated property,
then the market value of the property given to charity is
deductible for up to 30% of the donor's adjusted gross
income. In either case, though, the donor may also deduct any
excess gift amounts over a five year carryforward period.
</P>
<P>There exist several gift methods, including the
following:</P>
<UL><LI>Gifts to Custodians for a Minor,</LI>
<LI>Long-term Trusts for a Minor,</LI>
<LI>Permanent Death Benefit,</LI>
<LI>Life Insurance Trusts,</LI>
<LI>Low-interest Loans.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Finally, community development investing opportunities
exist where the investor purchases, through a mutual fund, a
one, three, or five year note at below-market rates. The
money is pooled and loaned to community development
organizations for home ownership loans. Although the investor
does not receive a tax credit for their investment, this
option allows someone to give other individuals in their
community an opportunity for low-interest home loans.</P>
<P>As the following data suggests, individuals accounted for
more than 85% of the total charitable giving in the US during
1994.</P>

<P>When considering a long-term gift plan, one should
inquire about the administrative fees and overhead expenses
to ensure that the majority of the donation ends up going to
the cause instead of just administration and fund raising
costs. Typically, a plan in which 80% or more of the donated
funds reach their target, is considered efficient.</P>

<HR><CENTER><H2>Personal Profile: Bob Leonard, Portfolio Manager</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>Although the Leonards' didn't discuss stocks or the markets while Bob and his siblings were growing up, Bob remembers his father showing him the stock certificates from where he worked.  Now that both Bob and his brother Jim work for investment firms, Wall Street is a big part of the Leonard family.</P>
<P>Bob first became interested in investments after high school when he got a summer job at a bank.  He was required to take coffee breaks each morning, although he doesn't even drink coffee nor was there anyone else there to talk with.  Since he had already read the sports news in the morning, he took to the business pages, and started learning about companies and their stocks.  The more he read, the more interested he became.  It's now been ten years since he started to follow stocks.  (Some favorites were Coca Cola and Disney, two issues that are in some of our portfolios today.)</P>
<P>He had already decided on a business education, and was accepted into the highly regarded Wallace Carroll School of Business at Boston College (It rates as "Most Competitive" in Barron's Guide to Colleges and Universities).  He was thinking about majoring in quantitative analysis (later renamed operations and strategic management).  After taking a finance course during his sophomore year, he changed to a double concentration, including finance (a concentration is BC's equivalent to a mini major of four courses).  Learning finance came easily to him.  He still wondered, from time to time, if he wouldn't be happier with a career in manufacturing.</P>
<P>After his junior year, he went to Nantucket with friends.  It's still one of Bob's favorite places to visit each summer.  He returned to school, knowing that he would be responsible for his rent.  He landed a job at Putnam Investments, where he continued to work during the school year.  Putnam is one of the largest mutual fund companies, and Bob realized he would need some practical education to get a good job.  Although he could have worked there after graduation, Bob instead chose Brown Brothers Harriman, an esteemed firm that handles custody and securities processing for large investors.  He worked his way up through the ranks of operations, the division that does pricing and record keeping for international mutual funds.  	Bob took investment courses at the Boston Security Analysts Society, read Peter Lynch's first book on the subway commuting to work, and also heard him speak at school.  Meanwhile, work at Brown Brothers was becoming routine, and he started to think about alternative opportunities. <
<P>Jobs in investment management are notoriously difficult to land, but he persevered.  When he saw the FinArc (then Financial Architects) ad in the Boston Globe, he figured we were small, but it seemed like a place where he could "make a difference".  He has made many contributions, which is why Catherine offered him part ownership of the firm.  </P>
<P>When Bob joined FinArc he started working in operations, doing research assistant work on the side.  It was clear that he was analyst material, and is now spending most of his time following the stocks of companies in his industries.  He recently started managing his first portfolio, and now supervises Betty Gilman, who does the lion's share of the operations work.  New technological enhancements have allowed us to reduce the time allocated to the back office work, giving all of us more time for other work. </P>
<P>On a personal note, Bob's experience at Brown Brothers not only helped him land the job at FinArc, but was also where he met his girlfriend of three years, Tricia, along with making other friends.  In his spare time he is a major fan of the Boston College football team, and enjoys reading about history, and traveling to historical sites.  Bob passed the final (third annual) exam for the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation.  He expects his charter in February of 1997.  </P>

<TITLE>Pax World Fund Overview </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY ><BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<IMG SRC="smglobe.gif" WIDTH=44 HEIGHT=41 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=left>
<H2>Pax World Fund, An Overview:</H2>
 <CENTER> <IMG SRC="grnline.gif" WIDTH=462 HEIGHT=5> </CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>he Pax World Fund is a no-load, diversified, open-ended, balanced mutual fund that uses both financial and social criteria to select its holdings.  The Fund invests in securities which not only present financial opportunity but also reflect the values and consciences of its investors.  The Fund  contains a mix of stock and bond securities screened for their suitability by skilled researchers in finance and ethics</P>
<P>  Established in 1970, it is the first mutual fund to have adopted broad "socially responsible" standards for its investments.  The Pax World Fund was created to serve investors who desire a professionally-managed, diversified portfolio that pursues return with moderated risk in a way that has a positive social impact.</P>
<P> The Pax World Fund invests in companies and debt obligations that are engaged in "life-supportive" goods and services such as health care, housing, food, education, pollution control, utilities, and leisure-time.  The Fund does not invest in companies involved in the production of weapons, tobacco, liquor, gambling or nuclear power among others.</P>
<P>Companies that fit the above criteria are then examined as to how they conduct business from financial, environmental and social standards.  Only those that meet the Fund's high standards in all categories are chosen for inclusion in the Fund.  While no company is perfect, we invest in those that are relatively more attractive as defined by our screens.<P><BR>
<IMG SRC="smglobe.gif" WIDTH=44 HEIGHT=41 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=left>
 <H2>The Philosophy Of Socially Responsible Investing:</H2>
 <CENTER> <IMG SRC="grnline.gif" WIDTH=462 HEIGHT=5> </CENTER>             
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>S</FONT>ocially responsible investing <B>integrates personal and social values with investment decisions.</B>  This approach is a recognition of the fact that providing capital to companies tacitly endorses their activities.  While you have limited control over the use of your tax dollars, you are in total control of your investment dollars and what you wish to support with them.
            
<P><B>The screening of investments,</B> both inclusive and exclusive, as well as shareholder monitoring allows socially responsible investors to influence business practices in a positive fashion.  Towards this goal the Pax World Fund brings substantial experience and enhancement of individuals' efficacy.  As the first Fund to use broad social criteria, it pioneered the concept of a mutual fund with a conscience.  
             
<P><B>The Pax World Fund's performance</B> has proved that rigorous financial and social standards need not be in conflict with one another.  In fact many of the criteria that the Fund employs (i.e. environmental responsibility, a well cared for work force) are seen by many economists as enhancing the long-term potential of companies that practice them.
             
<P><B>Individuals can and do have a positive impact</B> through their support of companies that share their values.  Socially responsible investment vehicles are in fact one of the fastest-growing segments of the mutual fund industry over the past ten years.

What is screened into the Fund's portfolio is seen as equally important as to what is screened out in terms of the Fund's ultimate influence.

A social responsibility questionnaire is then completed during an interview with officers of prospective firms.  If after evaluation, the company is found to meet the Fund's requirements, an investment is authorized to be made when price and market conditions are deemed favorable.                     <P>   <I><FONT SIZE=4>Periodic Review</FONT></I><P>The investment committee periodically reevaluates the Fund's holdings to assure that they are maintaining the standards which justified their entry into the Fund's portfolio.  Changes in share price or dividend payments, policy directives, and annual reports are all scrutinized for signs of a change in direction in either economic or social attractiveness.  If a conflict with the objectives of the Fund arises, the managers undertake to sell the security; immediately if the price is favorable, or otherwise in a period of no longer than six months, even if this means a loss.<P>                                  <IMG SRC="smglobe.gif" WIDTH=44 HEIGHT=41 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=left>          <H2>The People Behind Pax World Fund</H2> <CENTER> <IMG SRC="grnline.gif" WIDTH=462 HEIGHT=5> </CENTER>        <P>      <FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>he Pax World Fund is run by people who have made a lifetime's work of promoting peace, equality and justice.  It is not a division of a large fund company that considers socially responsible funds just another niche market.  When the Pax World Fund was created over twenty five years ago it launched a significant development in the mutual fund marketplace that lives on in the over forty socially responsible funds that have followed in Pax's footsteps.            <P>Another unique aspect of the Pax World Fund is its affiliation with <B>Pax World Service</B>, a non-profit, tax-exempt foundation.  Since its founding in 1970, the Service has promoted efforts towards world peace, sustainable development, reforestation and cultural exchanges.   The Service functions in the same spirit as the Pax World Fund,  translating ideas of how to improve our planet into reality through concrete actions and hard work.            <P>Dr. J. Elliott Corbett, a founding director of the Fund, served as president of the Service for its first twenty years.  Thanks to the support of many Pax share-holders, the Fund's directors, as well as independent donors, Pax World Service has been pursuing the above goals out of its Washington DC office since its inception.  <P>          <CENTER> <A HREF="index.htm"> Welcome Page</A>;  <A HREF="pwqna.htm">Next:<I>  Some Commonly Asked Questions</I></A>;  <A HREF="pwform.htm"> To order a Prospectus</A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

All have been active in the administration of the management company since its founding in 1970.            <P><B>Q: What fees does the Fund charge?</B><BR><B> A:</B> Because Pax is a "no-load" fund, no sales charge or redemption fee is paid by the investor to Pax.  All moneys placed with the Fund are fully credited to the shareholder's account.  The Fund charges a fee for operating costs (bank, legal, accounting, printing, advisory, etc.), which is charged against the Fund's earnings and which charges the Fund endeavors to keep below 1% of net assets annually.  If the investor chooses to invest through a broker/dealer or financial planner, these persons may charge a transaction fee for their services.              <P><B> Q: How are income and capital gains paid?</B><BR><B> A:</B> Dividends are paid on a semi-annual basis in the months of July and December.  The Fund has paid dividends without interruption since 1972.  Capital gains, if any, are distributed annually in the month of December.  An investor can receive all dividends and capital gains in cash; can reinvest all capital gains and dividends in their account; or, receive all dividends in cash and reinvest all capital gains in their account. The daily net asset value reflects the accumulation of dividend income and capital gains that have been accrued but not distributed.            <P><B>Q: Does Pax accept IRA Plan accounts?</B><BR><B>A:</B> Yes, you can set up a new IRA account with Pax or you can transfer your existing IRA account into the fund.  An employed taxpayer not covered by an employer-maintained retirement plan may deduct up to a $2,000 IRA contribution annually.  Earnings on your IRA investment compound free of current income taxes.  You are taxed on those earnings only when you withdraw money from the account, presumably after retirement, when your tax-bracket may be lower.  If you are covered by an employer maintained retirement plan you may still be able to deduct contributions to an IRA account  if adjusted gross income is less than $35,000 a year ($50,000 if filing jointly).            <P><B>Q: How can I keep track of my investment's performance?</B><BR><B> A:</B> The daily net asset value or share price is quoted daily under "mutual funds" in the financial pages of most newspapers (Symbol: PaxWld).  Account statements are sent out whenever there is activity in an account and also on a semi-annual basis.  We do not send out monthly statements both to save paper and keep expenses at a minimum.  Specific account, dividend and net asset value information can be accessed by calling <B>1-800-372-7827</B> or by writing to:  <B>Pax World Fund Inc., P.O. Box 8930, Wilmington, DE 19899.</B><P>       Of course, shareholders also receive semi-annual and annual reports which contain detailed information about the Fund's performance as well as its holdings.  The Fund also sends out a twice yearly newsletter with articles, profiles, interviews and other material that may interest shareholders.  <P>            <B>Q: What other types of investment programs does the Pax Fund offer?</B><BR><B>A:</B>  The Pax Fund's <B>Automatic Investment Plan</B> offers  the convenience of "dollar cost averaging."   You may arrange to have a fixed amount (minimum amount $50) automatically deducted from your checking or savings account each month and invested in your Pax World Fund account.<P>             The Fund's <B>"403b Pension Plan"</B> is available to persons employed by non-profit organizations (schools, churches, hospitals, foundations, etc.)<P>            The <B>"Uniform Gift to Minors Account"</B> is an excellent way to save for a child's education.  Recent studies show that increases in college tuition average 6 to 7% annually.<P>            The<B> "Simplified Employee Pension Plan"</B> (SEP-IRA) allows investors to make tax-deferred contributions for themselves and for employees.  The maximum contribution is 15% of compensation or $22,500, whichever is less.  The contribution amount is flexible and the reporting is minimal.<P>            The <B>"Voluntary Withdrawal Plan"</B> makes it possible for an investor to receive a monthly check from their account.  This plan requires a minimum investment of $10,000.            <P><B>Q: How can I find out more about the Fund?<BR>A:</B> For more information simply click on the <B>"to order a prospectus"</B> link below and fill out the information requested, or you can contact the Fund at:            <P>Pax World Fund, Inc.<BR> 224 State Street<BR>Portsmouth, New Hampshire 03801<P>             or call:                    <H2>1-800-767-1729</H2>            <P>For Shareholder Account information:<BR>1-800-372-7827<CENTER> <IMG SRC="grnline.gif" WIDTH=462 HEIGHT=5> </CENTER><P><CENTER> <A HREF="index.htm"> Welcome Page</A>;  <A HREF="recent.htm">Next:<I>  Recent Performance</I></A>;  <A HREF="pwform.htm"> To order a Prospectus</A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<H3>Avoiding Enslavement </H3>

<P><EM>by Christina McCale, copyright August 1995, all rights reserved</EM></P>

<HR>

<P>	What could be better than working virtual office? Getting up 5 minutes before your Monday morning conference call... Going to work in Levis and Rugbys rather than suits and heels... Never having to worry about the forgotten packed lunch sitting on the kitchen counter... The cost and time savings alone is enough to make even the most conservative employee take a serious look at "working virtual." </P>

<P>	As a virtual office worker, I've never loved going to the office more... and wouldn't trade my VO for anything. But like all the entrepreneurs, and other home office workers in the US, I've learned a lot of things the hard way. So before you pack up your cubicle and start setting up shop in your second bedroom, there are some serious considerations you may want to think through. </P>

<P>	There is a key difference in working VO from working at the office. Working virtual office is like going back to a college schedule. The workday is defined not by when the office opens and closes, but by meeting deadlines and respecting your team's personal obligations...Both of which are essential to a balanced life. And when one of these gets off balance, business suffers.</P>

<P>	Arranging your virtual lifestyle and implementing self-management are the key ingredients. Almost immediately, that means setting up an office space, and deciding on a work schedule. Both contribute to setting boundaries and establishing a sense of routine for the new VO worker. </P>

<P>	While your first inclination may be to go buy the latest digital cellular telephone or electronic organizer, remember to address the basics first-- whatever those may be for your particular field or type of tasks you will be doing. For example, a good sized desk, a comfortable chair, a file cabinet, and a well-stocked bookcase, are the cornerstone for someone who will spend the majority of his/her time in the office. They will need to address such things as fax lines, call waiting and phone systems with head sets. But if you tend to travel more than you are in the office, the laptop computer, a cellular phone with PC modem capabilities, and a good remote access voice mail system would be invaluable. The key to remember is technology is there to enhance and make your life easier... Not to make it more difficult. For example, in my office, I have a Franklin planner that runs my life. But it is far too big and bulky to carry with me to client meetings or with me when I travel. So I have an electronic organizer that easily slips into my purse for those follow up appointments as well as all the phone numbers of my technical consultants and important contacts. The point is, find what you are comfortable with, what you will use, and then use it. If you don't, it will be wasted effort, time and money ... None of which the virtual worker can afford to waste.	</P>

<P>	Just as important as the physical surroundings is the conscious determination of scheduled life. Time management is an even more critical skill for the alternative workplace employee who has no one but themselves to rely on. And as many have said, it is nothing more than discipline. And like every discipline, working virtual office can be learned. </P>

<P>	Developing a ritual may be the first step to keeping oneself on track. Whether it's cleaning off the desk at the end of the day, making a to do list in the morning, relying on delivery services or selecting certain times in the day to turn off the phone and concentrate on tasks, the virtual worker must maintain a sense of discipline over how one productively spends one's time.</P>

<P>	However, most VO workers don't run into trouble because they work odd hours or too few hours, but because they work too many hours. More than 80 percent of virtual employees work more than 40 hours a week... the average being 55. With your PC only a few steps away, it's tempting to spend all day, and all night and all weekend, toiling away. While working long and hard can be a key to success, part of being a virtual is managing yourself: Knowing when to "give yourself the afternoon off, rewarding yourself for good work, and knowing when to say no to a project you don't have time for." If you don't pay attention to your personal need for rest and recreation you can get burnt out. And while you might get the work done, you can loose the creative edge that made you successful, along with the self confidence and energy needed to take on new challenges. Remember, there's a reason why employees are legally entitled to 15 minute breaks and a lunch hour during the work day. And you are entitled. If your work keeps you cooped up in the office, take a break. Without the hassle of driving to the closest fast food place to pick up lunch, you can now focus on what helps you "chill out." Part of my ritual includes getting up to go ride the recumbent bikes at 6 am (with a handful of magazines in tow), then driving to my favorite latte stand, before jumping into the daily grind. Lunch can consist of a handful of crackers and cheese, but also a quick peak at how my favorite soap is going. </P>

<P>	Being a virtual employee also means having upkeep written into your job description. You have to pay attention to the basics: paying bills, cleaning the office etc. and the relationships in your life as well. Don't forget to call your co-worker and wish them a happy birthday, or to ask how your friend's vacation was. The point is, when you work VO, there isn't a lunch room or water cooler to gather around and talk about everyone's weekend. So you have to make time to not only acquaint yourself with your virtual co-workers, but also to not let work overrun your life so much that your other friends feel pushed out.</P>

<P>	The purpose of virtual office isn't just environmental or economic: it's holistic. It's meant to bring balance to our overworked, over-taxed lives. But it's hard work maintaining that balance. If you can aggressively set your boundaries and discipline yourself to accomplish your own tasks and goals, you can make VO work for you too. </P>

<HR>

<P>	Establishing a team isn't easy -- and establishing a virtual one is even tougher. But there are resources to help you.

<H3>Virtual Leadership</H3>



<P><EM>by Christina McCale, copyright August 1995, all rights reserved</EM></P>



<HR>



<P>	For some people, it sounds like something right out of Star Trek. Employees, all located in different spots throughout the area, are slowing dialing in and conferencing onto a conference call bridge for their Monday morning meeting. They'll discuss the normal things: upcoming events for their team, issues they're all facing, and deadlines for projects. Some may be putting the finishing touches onto an article they're trying to submit; Others may be putting on their makeup while listening to a co-worker drone on about their latest pet peeve. And then the meeting ends, and they all go on their ways to get their weeks started. </P>



<P>	In some ways, it's not so futuristic. In fact, it happens every week for some employees who work for organizations that have made the commitment to offer Virtual Office as a way of working. But for some leaders, this is a challenge they didn't learn about in Business School, a tactic they haven't read about. </P>



<P>	The real issue in developing a virtual office environment isn't the technology costs involved, the availability of qualified employees, or even the credibility factors for the general public. There are more than enough highly skilled workers available; the technology price tags have dropped consistently over the last decade and a good PR executive can address the public's perception. No, the real issue is the leader's security in allowing his/her employees to become virtual. </P>



<P>	Back in the good old days of the Industrial Revolution, American workers produced mainly tangible goods for resale, in a centralized location where they could be managed. Output could be counted and compared to standards. However, in today's economy based on the Information Age, organizations are finding it more and more difficult to "manage" highly educated, highly skilled workers who are being paid for their creativity, their expertise and their performance. The ideology of management, as America has known it -- even until the recent 80s -- will become more and more obsolete as the American workplace moves back home. VO Supervisors will need the leadership ability to involve and inform workers of the organization's goals, provide needed information, materials, authority, and coaching so that employees can devise solutions, game plans and products that will meet the ever changing market demands. This transformational style of leadership relies on the ideology that trust, interdependence, genuineness, empathy, risk and success, will all contribute to a highly functioning, productive and ethical work team.</P>



<P>	Trust your employees? Be empathetic? Risk? To some this sounds far fetched and highly unconventional -- a rather big leap in times like these. But, indeed, we are in unconventional times. The American marketplace must continue to transform itself to keep pace with the global demands if businesses want to remain competitive. And transformation, in its broadest sense, doesn't just mean how you lead people, but how and where you do business. </P>



<P>	These elements, Trust, Interdependence, Genuineness, Empathy, Risk, and Success are defined as the TIGERS values, and are the foundation of TIGERS Success Series. The fact that a team is virtual only makes these qualities more necessary, for if one of these values are lacking, the effects in a virtual working relationship are only compounded. </P>



<P>	The values are really simple -- but sometimes difficult to implement because they go counter culture to everything we as business people have been taught to do. If your employees have been educated and tooled to perform the tasks and objectives assigned a manager must trust their competency to perform. Teams must be able to share information honestly, and come to an understanding that "if I win, we win." Genuineness becomes integral to the virtual team, in part because virtual employees must be independent: genuine acting people are willing to feel and think for themselves. Whether it's developing a marketing plan in an way that is not the boss', or turning down a friend's offer to play hooky from work (after all, who would know?) and go to the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, a virtual employee must have the highest sense of genuineness and conscience in completing the job at hand. The transformation occurs when the supervisor is able to trust the critically thinking employee enough to potentially "stray outside of the lines" while in the pursuit of meeting objectives and enable the person to still meet the goal. Risk is rampant throughout the virtual team development process: risk to public disapproval; risk of employees submitting inaccurate expense vouchers, going AWOL or playing hooky; risk of employees simply not performing; risk of loss of public image, company equipment ... and the list goes on and on. The risk of implementing a virtual office environment, at least from the company's perspective, is phenomenal. And the risk felt from the employee side is no less important. It can be as simple as the risk of being forgotten when promotion time comes around. But in light of the risks, more often than not, the benefits out weigh the risks involved. In some cases, virtual teams or employees is the difference between corporate survival and bankruptcy; between product success and mediocrity.</P>



<P>	And success: the celebration of accomplishing what a team sets forth to do. One has to know what the end result is, in order to know when they are finished -- or when they have succeeded in accomplishing what they have set out to do. </P>



<HR>



<P>	Establishing a team isn't easy -- and establishing a virtual one is even tougher. But there are resources to help you.

Perhaps their minds are not on the game and the ball plunks down between three able but dazed players.</P><P>"I thought you had it!" one maintains.</P><P>"What do you mean? It's your position," the other asserts.</P><P>"Hey, lighten up. It's only a game," the third player shrugs returning to the game. Tempers flare, problems surface and a finely trained team perseveres sailing through to game point In the business world, however, team building is more than a game or vogue buzz word.</P><P>Although the business buzz words "team" and "team building" evoke a sports image, they are often abused. Take for example the help wanted ads. In one ad an employer was advertising for a team player who can work autonomously, taking the ball and running with it. What does working autonomously and running with the ball have to do with working with other people in an interdependent capacity? The ad conjures up the image of a lone player, an athlete who catches a pass and scores a touchdown. In another ad, an employer was looking for a real team player. What does this mean? For some, the assumption is that a real team player goes along with management decisions and does not rock the boat.</P><P>From a sound organizational perspective, teams reflect a management style that combines shared company vision, empowered employee participation, effective communications, good people skills, and a reason to work together that makes sense. These qualities are inherent to interdependence.</P><P>Interdependence fosters the notion that cooperative effort is a higher order of operation than promoting and rewarding independent action. The idea of interdependence is also based on the inspiration that each individual is personally accountable and responsible for organizational success. This frees all people within an organization to actively participate in success. The principle involves much more than tossing words around like a football because many management practices hinder participation and resulting organizational success.</P><P>Dr. Ed Demming asserts in his 85/15 Rule that eighty-five percent of the problems in business today are due to problems with the system rather than the employees. Yet, people do suffer from mismanaged systems and inappropriate leadership. These frequently result in punitive finger pointing and management systems which exercise greater control over employee actions.</P><P>In a New York Times syndicated article written by Jane Brody entitled, "Overwhelmed by Work", Brody writes that the leading cause of employee burnout today is due to "little personal control allowed in doing one's job." Furthermore, employees claim that poor communication between themselves and management influences burnout.</P><P>Likening effective business practices to a healthy family, Brody concludes that workers should be allowed to participate in making decisions that influence the quality of their work lives. They should have voice and know it is heard. The benefit to management is reduced employee stress resulting in increased morale. The impact is often felt in reduced absenteeism, decreased job turnover, and increased productivity.</P><P>That increased employee participation results in increased production is well documented. This is true for small businesses as well as larger organizations. The idea is to transfer the job flexibility and entrepreneurial pride of small business to larger organizations. This requires increased proactive company communications between management and employees, interdependence, across-the-board problem solving and conflict resolution skills; goal setting, inter-relational training for both managers and employees, and teambuilding. Therefore, teams are encouraged to embrace participation which nurtures accountability, responsibility and commitment from both employees and management.</P><P>Being a good team player, then requires interdependence and a we win, I win attitude. From an ethical standpoint, recruiting, good team players implies that systems and management practices are congruent and support participation which influences both relationship and work success.</P><P>Dianne Loy Ferri is the founder of TIGERS Success Series.

It is leadership style and practice that helps develop and employee's full potential.

Notonly are they being asked to participate in a major decentralizationprocess and to implement pragmatic and holistic models in classroomsand curriculum development, but they are expected to build strongteams at all levels from classrooms, to school site councils todistrict administration.<BR><P>While most agree these are really great ideas, fewhave a clue how to get there.  And there are monumental challengesto overcome in the process.<BR><P>As a group, teachers isolated for years in the self-containedclassrooms learned to be independent and autonomous.  Now theymust work as efficient teams.  In addition, administrators, principals,teachers and parents are human and prey to all vagaries of humannature.  At the most mundane level, money issues can pit one againstthe other.<BR><P>TIGERS Success Series of Spokane, Washington offersprograms and services that can help school districts and staffsbuild successful, functional teams.  TIGERS facilitators and materialssupport school personnel - from site councils to school boardsby teaching the skills necessary to effectively implement decentralizationand integrated holistic learning modes --as a team.<BR><P>Custom tailored, TIGERS programs are not a one-size-fits-allsolution.  Depending on a team's needs and requirements, activitiesmay include training in conflict resolution, team development,meeting management, group decision making, strategic planningdevelopment and leadership coaching.  <BR><P>Accurate, detailed group surveys and assessmentsidentify the needs, the appropriate activities and track teamprogress.<BR><P>TIGERS surveys and trainings have been presentedthroughout the United States to public school and University teams,government and tribal groups, and major companies like AT&amp;T,Boeing, Supercuts and Price/Costco. In fact, TIGERS team buildingefforts with an Indian Nation and the work of TIGERS founder DianneLoy-Ferri was recognized by the United Nations Secretariat in1994 for promoting intergenerational cooperation and caring.<BR><P>Recently in one eastern Washington school district,the move toward decentralized site-based councils was significantlyincreasing the individual team's responsibilities.  They wereseeking workable solutions and a pilot TIGERS survey of four schoolteams was implemented.<BR><P>Leona Dater of the Washington Educational Association,who was involved in the project observed, &quot;We were workingon a cultural shift.  In many areas, teachers have worked as individuals;there has never been an expectation that the staff work as a team. If a school is moving toward a team approach, the TIGERS instrumentcan identify where to focus limited staff development dollarsto really make a difference.  When administrators act as changeagents, this instrument can be a thermometer to spot where todirect resources to get the most bang for the buck.&quot;<BR><P>According to Dater, the survey was extremely accuratein revealing the characteristics and needs of the four teams.<BR><P><I>Claudia Craven has Washington State and Californiateaching credentials.

<H3>WHAT ARE TYPICAL TIGERS ACTIVITIES?</H3>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">TIGERS Teem Wheel - One of the most
distinctive activities of TIGERS is The TIGERS Team Wheel which
is normally used as an initiating activity.  This problem solving
activity and facilitation exercise teaches groups the six TIGERS
values and addresses the behaviors necessary for healthy group
dynamics.  It is based on the deceptively simple, but yet powerful,
TIGERS Team Wheel Game.  Because it is &quot;game-like&quot; in
nature it is non-threatening, but quickly gets at some very deep
issues surrounding the dynamics of the group performing the exercise.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">At the start of the game, the group
divides into two teams.  Each team must correctly assemble a six-piece
game board made up of the six TIGERS values, and agree on two
different pre-printed definitions for each value.  Finally, all
the teams must agree on the same definitions and board arrangement
by the end of the time limit (usually between 25 and 35 minutes).
 Right or wrong, everyone must reach consensus by the end of the
game.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">After the game is finished, facilitators
guide a group discussion on the participants' observations and
perceptions.  They help the group connect the findings to team
improvement and transfer the concepts and skills learned to their
real-life situation.  The Socratic facilitation style of TIGERS
Team Wheel session allows and encourages learning to emerge from
a collaborative and cooperative problem solving experience.  The
TIGERS Team Wheel is a pragmatic and holistic learning exercise.
 Socially oriented and inquiry-based, it emphasizes unity and
interrelationships.  This tool helps groups learn how to set realistic
goals, aids groups in sequential planning and adds structure to
the initial chaos experienced in the group development processes.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Since the game's debut for the National
Institute for Applied Ethics in 1995, the TIGERS Team Wheel has
been presented in varied groups.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Originally designed as a team-building
tool for adult co-workers, the game has been successfully presented
to high school students and is being adapted for middle-school
students.  Today it has a valid place in assisting site-based
decision making and for individual classroom use.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<H3>Leadership/Group Development Workshops</H3>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Leadership and group development workshops
that address each of six TIGERS values are also available from
trained TIGERS facilitators.  Topics can include leadership training
and development, group facilitation skill development, group maintenance
and problem solving skill development, group conflict resolution
training and group strategic planning.  What topics are best for
a given group?  This can be determined through the TIGERS Team
Wheel exercise and the TIGERS Survey.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<H3>The TIGERS Survey</H3>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The purpose of this sophisticated group
survey and assessment tool is to evaluate a group's needs and
project the types of in-service training that would be most valuable
for each group's unique development.  The information revealed
by a TIGERS survey can help school districts and other organizations
avoid costly strategic planning and implementation mistakes. 
Information from the survey can also help organizations in three
critical areas:  provide accurate data for future group development;
help develop research resources for over-site committee review;
and develop site specific team awareness.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The TIGERS survey tool was recently
used to assess an eastern Washington school district with the
cooperation and involvement of the Washington Education Association
and the Eastern Washington Uniservice council.  At the completion
of this pilot study, all the collaborators were impressed with
the survey's accuracy.  They concurred that the project was a
step forward in understanding what decentralization truly means
and the process involved in achieving it.  According to Leona
Dater, the survey was extremely accurate in revealing the characteristics
and needs of the four teams.  She further stated, &quot;when administrators
act as change agents, this instrument can be a thermometer to
spot where to direct resources and get the most bang for the buck.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The mission of the eastern Washington
study was to monitor the group dynamics of four volunteer sites
and answer the question, &quot;As schools embark on changing from
the traditional hierarchical school structure to a site-based
structure, what do they need to be concerned about?&quot;  The
goal was to obtain accurate and specific information to assist
the schools and the school districts.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">One finding disclosed by this educational
pilot study is consistent with all other TIGERS case studies.
 It is that each team was completely unique.  TIGERS acknowledges
this diversity.  Just as the fur pattern on the face of a tiger
is as unique as a human fingerprint, no two teams are or ever
can be the same.  Based on their essential differences, each team
functions within the framework of a unique culture.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">For this reason, follow-up training
recommendations were unique to each site.  This phenomena also
explains why training predictions in low-context, centralized
systems just don't seem to work out.  By contrast, decentralization
must focus on <I>change as a process</I>.  It must also support
each building/team as they adopt and clarify unique training solutions.
 Thus, for team development to occur, the site building staff
must be responsible and accountable for securing training, follow
through with post survey monitoring, and focus on it's own unique
growth process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The information generated by the pilot
project also provided other understandings and benefits at a building/team
level.<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The TIGERS survey showed the teams
what their group profile looked like on a specific day.  It provided
a team &quot;snapshot&quot; with a clear picture of team attitudes.
 The awareness furnished by the snapshot encouraged teams to self-reflect
and adjust their course.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Because the TIGERS survey is a scientific
way to assess team performance and training effectiveness, its
accuracy provides concrete measurable methods for monitoring team
progress throughout the decentralization process.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The TIGERS survey helped the groups
identify and address the core issues important to their unique
situation.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The primary benefit to a school
is that a TIGERS survey provides valid data, but is simultaneously
and specifically prescriptive to the unique needs of the situation.
 Therefore, they are more cost effective.  With two staff development
days, it is essential for teams to ask:  &quot;What do we really
need?&quot; and accountability to achieve it.</FONT>

<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Sustainable agriculture features healthy soil. Crop
rotation, beneficial insects, cover-cropping, microclimate
and water considerations are applied. Circular, natural
systems are employed. Profits belong to the farmers.
It's knowledge
intensive. Sustainable agriculture is a culture.</P>
<P>Sustainable agriculture farming practices work to reduce
water use and pollution. Knowledge of the local ecosystem
replaces chemicals. This knowledge includes:</P>
<UL><LI>pest-resistant crops;</LI>
<LI>crop history;</LI>
<LI>crop rotation;</LI>
<LI>diversification;</LI>
<LI>adaptation of crops to microclimates; and</LI>

</UL>
<P>Vandana Shiva (physicist, feminist, and author) believes
that the multiple exchanges between nature and people, and
people and people -- at every point in time -- is the basis for sustainable
agriculture.</P>
<P>There is encouraging growth in sustainable agriculture.
Since 1980, the number of acres devoted to organic production
has increased by 10 times (Organic Farm Research
Foundation).</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P><I>&quot;Farms are our most direct link to life. They
feed, sustain, and nurture us.&quot;</I></P>
<P><I>&quot;Green taxes on energy and chemicals will reverse
the disincentives to use sustainable agriculture and will
promote widespread use of existing benign methods to control
pests and increase yields, while providing chemical companies
with incentives to go back to the drawing broad and invent
farming techniques that improve yield and enhance
life.&quot;</I></P>
<P><B>Paul Hawken, Ecology of Commerce</B></P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P><B>THE SEED IS SACRED</B></P>
<P><I>&quot;The farmers of India (believe) the seed is
sacred. At the beginning of each growing season there is a
beautiful ceremony where they exchange the seed. For them,
the saving of seed is the highest form of culture, morals,
ethics, and spirituality...&quot;</I></P>
<P><B>Vandana Shiva, author</B></P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Seeds have been held in awe and respect for centuries.
Seed was the farmers currency to begin a new year. Industrial
agricultural marginalized that. Instead of saving the seed
from the best of each year's crop, the farmer's seed comes from a transnational
corporation. Seed is not saved. Hybrid seed (controlled by
corporation patents) do not grow true. Seed is developed and
marketed with an arsenal of pesticides. Yields increase, as
do water and input usage. The farmer is now only another cog
in the industrial cycle. </P>
<P>At one time seed was naturally generated from its
ancestors. The farmer's experience and knowledge created seed in
keeping with its purpose.</P>
<P>Seeds are a wondrous thing on earth -- all information for an entire life
waiting to burst forth. A tiny sunflower seed becomes a 12
foot stalk with 15 inch flower. Who can think of this process
and not be awed? </P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P><I>&quot;We harvested seed from an exquisite red
sunflower&ETH; the seeds every bit as beautiful as the
flower. That handful of reddish-brown, delicately striped
seeds holds the promise of another year's increase of
twenty-fold. I will enjoy the benefits of growing them. I
will be rewarded spiritually for participating in the magic.
I share seeds and excitement with friends. Birds live on the
seed through winter. I will eagerly await the plant, the
flower, the seeds... and seeing the process unfold again year
after year.&quot; </I></P>
<P><B>Mardelle Ceaser Feigenbaum, The GreenMoney
Journal</B></P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Seeds hold power; open-pollinated seeds hold the memories
of their ancestors in their DNA allowing them to adapt to
their area. Open-pollinated means that natural systems (wind,
animals, birds, and insects) transfer the pollen. </P>
<P>Human intervention, genetic engineering, and patenting
denies this process. When a corporation patents a seed, they
control it. Use of the seed results in cost to the farmer,
gain to the corporation, and theft from nature. This is
neither economically viable, environmentally sound, or
socially just. </P>
<P>In sustainable systems seeds belongs to all of us. No one
&quot;owns&quot; the seed. We do own the
knowledge of planting and harvesting. This knowledge is used
for the good of the community. This applies to seeds grown
for human food, and plants and flowers providing beauty for
all and food nourishing fellow creatures. Seed-saving is a
version of Noah's
Ark.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P><B>Soil Viability: </B></P>
<P>Nature's cycle
is exquisite in its simplicity. As plants and animals
decompose the soil recycles nutrients within the biosphere.
We live in a closed system. It is essential that the soil be
able to beneficially recycle everything applied to it -- or the delicate
balance is upset. Recovery from this upset is slow; we must
understand that soil health reflects the health and
productivity of all the earth's ecosystems. Our soil has been lost,
compromised, and violated by decades of industrial
agriculture methods. We need to sustain soil health and
restore what industrial agriculture has damaged.</P>
<P>Our soil is a complex, living system that represents a
limited resource vital to life. In nature, intricate mixtures
of minerals, living organisms, organic compounds interact
continually to sustain soil productivity, and filter and
detoxify the water. </P>
<P>Sustainable agriculture strives to replicate these
systems. The following methods are employed:</P>
<UL><LI>Crop rotation -<I> not monocropping</I>;</LI>
<LI>Cover-cropping - <I>decreasing erosion and fixing soil
nutrients</I>;</LI>
<LI>IPM - <I>integrated pest management (beneficial
insects); and</I></LI>
<LI>Timing - <I>careful attention to multiple
plant growth cycles.</I></LI>

 <P>
<B> CAMBRIDGE, MA</B> -What defines successful management?  The answer to this question changes over time. What has worked for companies in the 1990s isn't necessarily what will work in the new century. As we move forward, the factors that make for successful businesses today will become only part of the picture. The rest will be made up of new factors, including - I believe - sustainability. 
<P>
First, let's take a look at the 1990s and identify those characteristics that are shared by the business that have earned the most respect and the best stock market performance. I find six major factors: 
<P>
<B>1. Total quality management.</B> What began as an effort to ensure zero defects and to meet ISO 9000 standards has quickly evolved into an emphasis on designing products to meet consumer needs. Total quality management has become a company philosophy, practiced not only in manufacturing but in marketing, finance and other areas.       

<P>
<B>2.  Downsizing.</B> Many successful companies have learned to operate more efficiently, cutting back by approximately ten to fifteen percent across the board -management as well as work force. 

<P>
<B>3.  Core competencies.</B> Rather than trying to do everything for everyone, companies have focused on doing what they do best, relying on partnerships with other companies to accomplish the rest of the job.

<P>
  Is it possible that Winslow has something in common with DuPont (NYSE:DD)? 
      <P>      Believe it or not, yes. Both organizations profess the belief that environmental responsibility enhances shareholder value. While that's nothing new for Winslow, it's certainly new for DuPont, which has attributed at least part of its recent stock surge to the company's environmental programs and progress. 
         <P>   While preparing to speak at a Chemical Week conference this Fall on ISO 14,000 (WEN, May 1995), Winslow was surprised to hear the keynote speaker of the conference make the case for green investing. In a talk titled "The Environment and Shareholder Value", Ross Stevens, a corporate officer of DuPont, began with the premise that "companies that integrate environmental factors into their businesses will create more value for their stockholders than those that do not." 
         <P>   <B>A strategy based on shareholder value. </B> 
        <P>  
  Stevens reviewed DuPont's pyramid of shareholder value contributors (sales growth, cost management, and cash and earnings generation) and then spelled out some of the environmental aspects of the company's foundation of shareholder value drivers. 
         <P>   DuPont's strategy is sustainable growth through innovation and the integration of the environment into the company's business strategies. For example, Stevens stated that DuPont's reductions in toxic emissions and waste generation are reducing the company's costs and potential liabilities. This in turn leads to better insurance pricing, higher bond ratings, and a lower cost of capital all of which help improve DuPont's "operational fitness." 
        <P>    Stevens highlighted Dupont's programs for designing new products for the automotive, construction, electrical, and electronic markets using post-consumer waste. He also spoke of the Agricultural Products Division's new corn herbicide, Accent, a chemical that is less toxic and more effective at low use rates (5-10%) than conventional herbicides. While not a natural product, company documents indicate that Accent is more cost-efficient and less environmentally damaging than conventional herbicides.

Orbital Brings Space Benefits Down to Earth
</FONT>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=20% ALIGN=center SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>
<TT>BY BARBARA THORPE</TT></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P><BR></P>
<B>DULLES VA -</B>Not so long ago, the benefits of space technology were researved for the government.  Today, those benefits are accessible to private industry, and both Orbital Sciences Corp. (NASDAQ:ORBI) and the environment stand to gain.
<P>
In its 1995 report Orbital states that by introducing space related
 technologies and services at dramatically lower cost than ever before, the company is "bringing the benefits of space down to Earth." Now that satellites are smaller and more efficient, space technology is much more affordable. Driven by these advances and the increased profitability in the commercial sector, Orbital is shifting away from its government customer base:
 in 1992,  80% of Orbital's revenues were government related, while by 1995 that number had dropped to 40%. The firm's total 1995 revenue were $354 million. 
<P>
The major cost saving factor has been the reduction in satellite weight, resulting in smaller payloads and closer orbits. Today, functions that once required a satellite weighing nearly ten tons can be handled by one that weighs about 100 pounds. While the heavier satellite had to be delivered to an orbit 23,000 miles from Earth, the lighter one orbits just 500 miles up. 
<P>
<B>Satellite Services: smallest and fastest growing.</A></B>
<BR>
Satellite Services is the smallest of Orbital's three product divisions (it's responsible for only 2% of revenues), but its 50% potential growth rate is the highest. The major avenue of growth in this sector is through ORBCOMM, a global partnership 50% owned by Orbital and 50% by Teleglobe Inc. of Canada. Gilford Securities analyst Otis Bradley projects that ORBCOMM revenue will exceed $500 million in the years 2000 and 2001.

<P>
<B>To the Editor:</B>
<P>
   Early on in my career as a minister, I learned that anyone who introduced environmental concerns to the investment world tended either to be dismissed as an other-worldly visionary or labeled an idealist who didn't have a clue about the marketplace.
<P>
In the past few years, through Winslow Environmental News, I've been amazed to discover that Winslow's investment philosophy intentionally links environmental responsibility with corporate profitability and shareholder returns. What not too long ago was hardly ever mentioned in the same breath with profit and return has now, for at least one investment management company, become a demonstrated policy. 
<P>
          No longer does thinking about sound investments have to be limited to the 
conventional objectives. Environmental responsibility has been added, with a magnitude that matches profit and return. 
<P>
 Things can change for the better.

<H4>MUTUAL FUNDS</H4>

<P>	1995: the success story of socially responsible mutual funds. Ten of the funds returned more than 30%. The top funds with return:</P>

<P>#1. Citizens Trust- Emerging Growth +40.7</P>

<P>2. Neuberger &amp; Berman- Socially Responsive +38.9</P>

<P>3. Calvert- Capital Accumulation +36.2</P>

<P>4. Dreyfus- Third Century +35.8</P>

<P>5. Aquinas- Equity Income +35.6</P>

<P>6. Domini- Social Equity +35.2</P>

<P>7. MMA Praxis- Growth +33.9</P>

<P>8. Parnassus- Income Balanced +31.1</P>

<P>9. Bridgeway- Social Responsibility +30.3</P>

<P>10. Aquinas- Equity Growth +30.3</P>

<H4>New SRI funds and management changes:</H4>

<P>	&#149; Calvert Social Managed Growth- The largest SRI fund with over $500 million in assets is now being managed by a team of investment managers: US Trust Co., NCM Capital Management and Calvert Asset Management (CAMCO). The new management structure and performance-based compensation plan was implemented in an effort to improve performance while maintaining the fund's conservative nature. In 1995 the fund returned 26% (the average for the Balanced category was 24.6%). </P>

<P>	The Calvert Capital Accumulation Fund had its first anniversary. The multi-manager fund returned 37% in 1995.</P>

<P>	&#149; Parnassus Funds were frequently covered by the (mainstream) press in 1995. SmartMoney magazine called the Parnassus Fund, "One of the 8 superstar funds for 1995 to own long-term." Money magazine's Summer '95 guide called the Parnassus Fund one of the "Top 80 terrific funds to buy now." In Fortune magazine's Investor's Guide 1996, they listed the Parnassus Fund as one of the "Mutual funds that adds the most value" (Growth category). The guide also listed the Parnassus Income Balanced Fund as one the "Best mutual funds for building wealth" (Balanced category). With all this press you can imagine the funds caught the attention of many people. The Parnassus Fund added about $10 million a month in assets in 1995. It is now over $275 million.</P>

<P> &#149; DevCap Shared Return Fund is a unique new fund that seeks to create a link between capital markets of the U.S. and the capital needs of microentrepreneurs in the developing world. It's the first socially-screened mutual fund that allows you to share your investment return with the world's microentrepreneurs.</P>

<P> Each year, the shareholder designates 50, 75, or 100% of the total return of the fund to be made as a tax-deductible contribution to the microenterprise development programs of DevCap's consortium members: Catholic Relief Services, Save the Children, Appropriate Technology International, and Seed Capital Development Fund. The consortium members administer their own micro-lending and training programs to assist small farmers, artisans, and entrepreneurs in developing countries.</P>

<P>	The DevCap Fund is based on an extremely successful French model currently in operation. DevCap gives individual investors the ability to invest for their own financial goals while sharing investment return with people who use it to become economically independent. Shares in the no-load fund are invested with the Domini Social Equity Fund. For a prospectus call (800) 371-2655. The no-load fund has a initial investment of $1000.</P>

<P>	&#149; Citizens Trust (formerly known as Working Assets Common Holdings) had a very busy year. To start with they went no-load in all funds. At the finish of 1995, the Citizens Trust Emerging Growth Fund was the #1 socially responsible fund returning +40.7%. They also released of their no-load Citizens Index Portfolio Fund. After approval from the shareholders they merged their Growth Portfolio and Balanced Portfolio into the Index Portfolio Fund. The reorganization made the new fund their largest, with over $100 million in assets. The Index Portfolio invests in 300 companies&#150; 200 of which come from the S&amp;P 500 and the other 100 are smaller companies with innovative products and services. The fund is thoroughly screened and committed to shareholder activism. The fund is managed by Rhumbline Advisers of Boston, MA. </P>

<P>	The E-Fund is a new product from Citizens Trust. The E-Fund is a new type of checking account, available to people who use direct payroll deposit, or another automated payment program. It includes a MasterCard money card (Debit/ATM card), unlimited checking with no minimum balance requirement after an initial $1000 investment, electronic funds transfer, and electronic payment options. Annual fee is $35. The E-Fund and Citizens Trust President, Sophia Collier were featured in The New York Times (Mutual Funds Quarterly Report) on October 8, 1995. </P>

<P>	&#149; Domini Social Equity Fund teamed up with South Shore Bank (SSB) to create a new money market fund, called Domini Money Market Account at South Shore Bank. The funds are used by SSB for community reinvestment to both build and rebuild neighborhoods, create self-sufficiency &amp; jobs, secure decent homes, and finance small businesses. The Domini Social Equity Fund itself doubled its assets during the year to over $60 million.</P>

<P> &#149; Flex-Partners released the new BTB Fund (Better than Bonds). This utility equity fund invests in the equity securities of domestic and foreign utility companies, excluding companies involved in the production of nuclear energy. Utilities include electrical, natural gas, water, telecommunications, etc.</P>

<P> &#149; Pro Conscience Women's Equity Fund changed its portfolio manager to Cheryl Smith, Vice President of US Trust Co. of Boston. Cheryl Smith is a CFA with a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University.</P>

<P> &#149; Green Century launched a new equity fund and liquidated their money market fund.</P>

<P>	Note: To learn more about investing in any of the funds, please call them and request a current prospectus and annual report. The annual report will help you understand their investment philosophy as well as their social, environmental, and financial objectives (See our performance chart ).</P>

<H3>Annual meeting highlights</H3>
<P><FONT SIZE=+5>&quot;T</FONT>he year 1995 was a stellar one for most mutual
funds, Pax World being no exception,&quot; Fund President
Luther Tyson announced at the Fund's annual meeting on June
12 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Pax achieved a total return
of 29.19%, outperforming the Lipper Balanced Fund Index by
18.71%. By favoring consumer-basic growth stocks over
cyclical stocks last year, the market played to the Fund's
strength, said Tyson, and Portfolio Manager Tony Brown took
advantage of the market trend by increasing the stock portion
of the Fund's investments. </P>
<P><IMG src="paxa.gif" alt="Tony Brown picture"
align="right" vspace=0.1 hspace=0.1>
 One-year total return as of May 31 was 21.13%, and the
Fund's assets grew by nearly 15% during the same period. Some
of the asset growth may have come from the Fund's first
ventures into cyberspace, including an ad placed on the
Internet in February of 1996, the establishment of an E-mail
address (<I>paxworld@nh.ultranet.com</I>), and the creation
of a Fund site on the World Wide Web
(<I>http://www.greenmoney.com/pax</I>). The Fund also broke
new ground by hiring its first sales representative, who will
target institutional pension accounts in the San Francisco
area.</P>
<P>After the election of directors, Tyson invited
shareholders to participate in a &quot;New England-style town
meeting.&quot; Here are some of the questions discussed
during that meeting:</P>
<P><B>Q:</B> <I>How do you determine whether portfolio
companies that are expanding, merging, or globalizing still
meet the Fund's social criteria? </I></P>
<P><B>Tony Brown:</B> We'll credit (Fund Vice President)
Jack Corbett with that; he keeps track of our social screens.
</P>
<P><B>Luther Tyson:</B> The movement for socially
responsible investing has developed organizations that
research these issues and publish reports on such companies,
and we subscribe to some of their publications. Our
pre-investment questionnaire about a company's adherence to
the Fund's social criteria and our periodic conversations
with corporate officers also tell us a lot. </P>
<P><B>Brown:</B> Companies are always adding new divisions
or buying other companies. Some years ago, it was very
fashionable for tobacco companies to buy food companies--RJ
Reynolds bought Nabisco, and Philip Morris bought Kraft, for
example. When a company we wouldn't own takes over a company
we do own, and we get paid in cash by the acquiring company,
then we're out of the investment. If it's a purchase using
stock, we have six months to divest.</P>
<P><B>Q:</B> <I>Mr. Brown, in your report you said one of
your criteria for selecting a company for the portfolio was
that it pay a dividend. If a company doesn't pay a large
dividend but has a strong total return--through long-term
growth in its share price--would you be interested in it?</I>
</P>
<P><B>Brown:</B> I favor a total-return approach to
investing. On the equity side of the portfolio, I don't try
to maximize the dividend, but I do like <I>some</I> dividend.
Most growth companies pay a dividend in the range of 2-3%,
and the rest of the return will come from growth in the share
price, which is where our biggest gains will be. </P>
<P><B>Q:</B> <I>When I established my retirement account
about five years ago, the general wisdom was that with
socially responsible funds, you give up 3-5% of return for
doing the right thing. Do you agree? (Obviously, I decided to
invest in Pax anyway!)</I></P>
<P><B>Tyson:</B> I don't see it that way. The truth is that
we are a balanced fund, so it's unfair to compare us with a
growth fund that is taking much higher risks in the market.
We compare ourselves to the Lipper Balanced Fund Index, which
tracks over 200 balanced funds. Last year, we outperformed
the index by almost 19%.</P>
<P><B>Brown:</B> In an up market, we will never do as well
as a fund that has all its assets in growth stocks and none
in bonds, but in a down market you'll love us! And over a
long period of time, the returns from the different styles
will tend to converge.</P>

<H3>Pax shareholder Head Start winner</H3>
<P><FONT SIZE=+5>W</FONT>hen Pax shareholder Maxine McKinney became a Head
Start director in 1986, her biggest problem was geography.
Headquartered in Onancock, Virginia, her program served a
two-county area on a 90-mile finger of land between the
Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. &quot;For many
years,&quot; she says, &quot;the only access was by ferry.
Now there's a 20-mile bridge, but it also carries a 20-dollar
toll.&quot; The area's isolation meant that resources such as
colleges and large corporations, which often aid Head Start
programs in mainland communities, weren't available. Luckily,
McKinney found help through a unique project sponsored by a
Pax portfolio company. </P>
<P><IMG src="paxb.gif" alt="Maxine McKinney picture"
align="right" vspace=0.1 hspace=0.1>McKinney was one of the directors chosen in 1993 to
participate in the Johnson &amp; Johnson Head Start Fellows
Program, a management training program run by the University
of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). During the program,
directors produce a Management Improvement Project (MIP),
which they are taught to implement when they return to their
centers. To cope with the challenge she faced--managing five
sites spread over a distance of 75 miles, with administration
in a sixth site--McKinney developed a MIP based on a
shared-decision-making model. </P>
<P>It worked. In fact, the intensive, two-year program for
senior and mid-level staff that she implemented worked so
well that McKinney was one of only two Head Start directors
honored by Johnson &amp; Johnson with the 1996 MIP Strategic
Initiative Award. Determined each year by a faculty panel at
UCLA, the award is based on a project's creativity, its
impact on its program and community, and its replicability in
other programs. The award's prize of $5,000 provides $3,000
to the Head Start center itself and $2,000 for the director's
own discretionary use.</P>
<P>Now living in Richmond, Virginia, and working as a
consultant for Head Start, McKinney downplays the
significance of her accomplishment: taking a program that had
60 children and only enough money to operate six months of
the year and transforming it into a program with 185 children
and a budget of nearly $1 million. She credits the Head Start
Fellows Program with &quot;opening up so many opportunities
and new ways of thinking for me as a manager. The real
story,&quot; she says, &quot;is Johnson &amp; Johnson and
what they're doing in the community.&quot;</P>
<P>Pax congratulates Maxine McKinney (whose husband, David
Rash, is also a Pax shareholder) and praises Johnson &amp;
Johnson for setting a strong example of good corporate
citizenship.</P>

<H3>Fees, fees, fees!</H3>
<P><FONT SIZE=+5>J</FONT>ust as there is no free lunch, there is no free
fund. Running a mutual fund costs money, and all funds charge
various fees to cover their costs. As an investor, you can
profit by understanding the types of fund expenses and how
they can affect your ultimate return from a fund. </P>
<P><B>Management fee</B>: Virtually all funds charge an
annual management fee to pay the portfolio manager for making
buy, sell, or hold decisions about fund investments. Usually,
the more aggressive or exotic the style of fund, the higher
the fee. Because it's a recurring fee (usually stated as a
percentage of average net assets), keeping it as low as
possible can be important for maximizing long-term
performance. </P>
<P><B>Front-end load</B>: Some funds sell their shares
through a commissioned sales staff. If you buy shares of such
a fund, you pay the commission, or &quot;load,&quot; which
can range from about 2 to 9%. The load provides no
performance incentive for the fund's portfolio manager,
because only the sales staff profits from the load, but a
load does affect shareholder return. </P>
<P>Initially, it reduces the amount of money invested by a
factor even greater than the stated load. For example, a 5%
load reduces a $10,000 <I>potential</I> investment to $9,500.
Restating the load as a percentage of this <I>actual</I>
investment reveals that the effective load is really 5.26%.
And because the initial investment is smaller, a front-end
load can reduce the effect of compounding on the investment
for years. From the very beginning, an investment of $9,500
must outperform an investment of $10,000 by a large margin to
regain the $500 sacrificed to a front-end load.</P>
<P>Savvy investors know that for every successful load fund
there is a comparably performing no-load fund. </P>
<P><B>12b-1 fee</B>: An annual fee used to pay for
distribution costs, including advertising and the
distribution of fund literature such as prospectuses and
annual reports, it can range from .1% to 1.25%. At the higher
levels, it often serves as a hidden load, with funds using
the proceeds to pay brokers who sell shares. </P>
<P><B>Back-end load</B>: Also called a redemption fee or an
exit fee, it's a charge for selling your shares of a fund. It
can be short term (to encourage you to stay with a volatile
fund for at least, say, six months), long-term (you pay
whenever you sell), or something in between (you pay a fixed
or declining rate if you sell during the first few years of
ownership). If you're stuck in an underperforming fund,
paying a fee for the privilege of investing elsewhere can
seem like having salt rubbed into your wounds. </P>
<P>Mutual funds can charge a variety of other fees--for
reinvesting dividends, for &quot;account maintenance,&quot;
for transferring to other funds in a family, for shareholder
accounting, for almost anything--but the four described above
are the most common. As an investor, your bottom-line guide
to a fund's fees is its &quot;expense ratio&quot;: the total
annual charges, expressed as a percentage of fund assets
(this figure is listed in the fund's prospectus). All other
things being equal, a lower expense ratio can mean higher
returns for you in the long run. </P>
<P>According to Morningstar, the fund ranking service, Pax
World's management fees fall in the lowest 15th percentile of
all mutual funds. Pax charges no front- or back-end load,
charges only 1/4 of 1% as a 12b-1 fee, and has an expense
ratio which is about two-thirds of the average for all mutual
funds.</P>

<H3>Supporting the UN</H3>
<P><FONT SIZE=+5>S</FONT>ince its inception, the United Nations has depended on
dues payments from its member countries. However, at the end
of 1995, 91 countries either had not paid their annual dues
or had paid only part of them. This included the United
States, which owed $1.2 billion of the $2.3 billion pledged
to the UN. The picture became even more serious this year,
and the international community currently owes the UN some
$3.2 billion.</P>
<P>For the past 21/2 years, Pax World Service's UN Support
Campaign (UNSC) has promoted alternative financing for the UN
and its related operations. PWS believes that many UN
activities merit our support and that these programs should
be financed in a manner less vulnerable to political whim
than the current system. &quot;The United Nations and the
international community should not be held hostage by the
political agenda of any one nation,&quot; argues UNSC
Director Richard Hahnen. &quot;Simply put,&quot; he says,
&quot;alternative funding is a way to ensure that vital
international services--in aviation, communications,
humanitarian aid, and world health--can continue to
function.&quot;</P>
<P>Of the various approaches to alternative funding, Hahnen
supports the concept of &quot;user fees,&quot; where, for
example, international airline passengers might pay a small
surcharge on their tickets, or brokers might pay a
transaction fee for international currency exchanges. Some
critics of alternative funding argue that it would give the
UN the power to tax and thereby become a world government,
but Hahnen notes that the authority to collect and allocate
money for international purposes would remain in the hands of
the member states.</P>
<P>No U.S. administration has yet endorsed alternative
financing, but support has been increasing in other quarters.
Recently, for example, UN representatives from 35 countries
met with UNSC staff to discuss the idea. Hahnen sees the
UNSC's best role as a behind-the-scenes actor,
&quot;attempting to succeed without getting credit for
it,&quot; he says with a chuckle. Although this makes
fundraising for the UNSC more challenging, the project's
success gained it renewed support recently from the PWS
board. </P>
<P>Hahnen likens his task to that of a Pax World Fund
investor: seeking steady progress toward a long-range
goal--and quietly making the world a better place in the
process.</P>

<H3>Profiting from diversity</H3>
<P><BR><I>Just as a wise portfolio manager mixes different
types of investments to add strength and resilience to a
portfolio, so does a wise company include different types of
employees to gain versatility and vision in its workforce. At
Pax, we favor companies that value diversity, and we feature
two such companies below.</I></P>
<P><B>Liz Claiborne, Inc.</B></P>
<P>Founded by its namesake, Liz Claiborne has a long
tradition of hiring and promoting women. Of the company's top
125 senior managers, approximately 43% are women, as are six
of the firm's 14 division presidents. All employees have
access to recruitment, career development, mentoring, and a
job posting system that encourages the promotion of women to
middle and upper management. </P>
<P>To support the needs of its employees, the company
provides 60 days of paid disability maternity leave, an
additional 12-week unpaid leave, and a negotiable flextime or
reduced work schedule for another 12 weeks. Health programs
subsidize on-site prenatal care classes and mammography and
breast care education, and the company maintains a 24-hour
telephone counseling and referral service. </P>
<P><B>Pitney Bowes, Inc.</B></P>
<P>In 1994 <I>Catalyst</I> chose Pitney Bowes as one of
three companies to receive the Catalyst Award for its
&quot;longstanding commitment to valuing a diverse
workforce.&quot; In 1995 <I>Hispanic</I> magazine included
the company in its list of the 100 companies providing the
greatest opportunities to Hispanics. Women represented 16% of
all business unit heads, vice presidents, executive
directors, and directors in 1994.</P>
<P>For the seventh consecutive year, <I>Working Mother</I>
magazine in 1994 named the company one of America's 100 best
for working mothers. Pitney Bowes offers work-at-home and
flextime programs, supports community child-care centers, and
reimburses employees for approximately two-thirds of the
costs of child care when children are sick. </P>

<H3>Janet Lawton Spates</H3>
<P><FONT SIZE=+5>&quot;I</FONT> love working with numbers, so it's perfect
for me,&quot; Janet Lawton Spates says of her job. As
Operations Manager for Pax World Fund, Janet oversees the
Fund's dealings with State Street Bank in Boston, the Fund's
custodian bank, tracking trading expenses, performance
figures, account management costs, etc. She also relays
information to Morningstar and other fund-tracking services
and prepares periodic financial reports for directors of the
Fund. &quot;I do all those sort of number-crunching
things,&quot; she says with a smile. </P>
<P><IMG src="paxc.gif" alt="Janet Lawton Spates picture"
align="right" vspace=0.1 hspace=0.1>Janet began crunching Fund numbers long before she
started working for Pax. She bought her first shares of the
Fund when she was just sixteen. &quot;I had had a couple of
shares of companies that were in the portfolio,&quot; she
recalls, &quot;and I thought the Fund was a good place to put
spare money for savings, as opposed to the bank.&quot; </P>
<P>She came to Pax four years ago, after receiving a degree
in management with honors from Bentley College in Waltham,
Mass. &quot;I like it here,&quot; she says, &quot;because
it's a small office where everyone knows what's going on and
because I do so many different things in my job.&quot;</P>
<P>Janet and her husband, Rich, live in Portsmouth and
celebrated their first anniversary in June.</P>

<P><BR>Information from the Investment Company of America's
1996 Investors Guide reveals that, during the last 20 years,
the difference in average annual return between
&quot;worst-day&quot; investments--those made at each market
top--and &quot;best-day&quot; investments--made at each
market bottom--was only 1.5%. For investors who try to
&quot;time&quot; the market, this is unwelcome news. For the
rest of us, it yields a valuable lesson: time in the market
is what counts, not timing<B> </B>the market. Using a
dollar-cost averaging strategy to invest a regular amount on
a regular basis, without worrying about market tops or
bottoms, can produce truly competitive returns. </P>
<P>For a good time in the market, call (800) 767-1729 during
normal business hours and ask for information about Pax's
Automatic Investment Plan.</P>

Organic Agriculture and Gardening, pt 4</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<H4>One Community's Solution </H4>
<P><B>&quot;Don't let them pave paradise!!!&quot;</B></P>
<P><I>Urban encroachment of farmland is happening
everywhere. In excess of one million acres of agricultural
land are paved. The township of Avon, Minnesota decided to do
something about it.</I></P>
<P><I>Avon is located north of the Twin Cities, in an area
that is growing quickly as many families move out of the
cities for better &quot;quality of life.&quot; Whenever a
piece of farmland comes up for sale, its site is located on a
series of aerial maps of the area's topography. If the
land is prime agricultural land, it is now against the law to
sell it for housing. So far, nine developers have been
thwarted from buying the land and building for immediate
profit only. But more importantly, when a new generation of
farmers who want to farm sustainably need land, there will be
land available.</I></P>
<H4>What can we do? Some helpful tips</H4>
<P>1. Garden biointensively (Grow compost/soil). John
Jeavons of Ecology Action and author of the book, How to Grow
More Vegetables than you ever thought possible on less land
than you can imagine offers a practitioner's bible on this method.
Biointensive practice takes on the challenge of growing food
consciously, in ways that heal our earth. Biointensive
gardening teaches the importance of growing soil.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P><I>&quot;They're making people every day, but they ain't
making any more dirt.&quot;</I></P>
<P><B>Will Rogers</B></P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>2. Buy a share in a Community Supported Agriculture
project (CSA). As a shareholder of a CSA you receive fresh
produce, often delivered to your door throughout the growing
season. Support your community by keeping your money in the
local economy. Participating in sustainable agricultural also
supports your community. You help to create small farms, jobs
for people, healthy soil (tilth) and biodiversity while you
receive fresh, locally grown goods. For information on
CSAs in your area
call the Bio-Dynamic Farming &amp; Gardening Association at
(800) 516-7797.</P>
<P>3. Visit your local farmer's market. They are loads of fun, buzzing
with friendly people and great produce. Find local organic
growers who have committed their hearts to our land and our
health. Support them.</P>
<P>4. Buy open-pollinated organic seed. Grow them and then
save the best seeds for next year. Biodiversity is in our
backyards, not in a test tube. Grow what you love. Find
related plants in the &quot;kinship circle,&quot; and grow them too. <B> Just say no</B> to
hybrid seeds. There are many sources for regional,
open-pollinated seeds (see the resource list). </P>
<P>5. When investing, select companies using sustainable
practices. Odwalla, Whole Foods, Blue Fish Clothing,
Thanksgiving Coffee, and Earth Trade all qualify. Monsanto,
Dow Chemical, and Chevron do not.</P>
<P>Combine these tips with the goal of restoring and
building community, and a powerful paradigm for our
collective future is born.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P><I>&quot;Make no mistake this farming revolution is about
more than food safety and environmental protection. This
revolution is about people and community. Increasingly
consumers want direct connection with their food. They want
to know where it came from and how it was produced and
processed. They want to know something about the farms and
farmers. They want to know what was added to the food during
processing. They want to know if they can trust the
assurances they are given on the label.&quot;</I></P>
<P><B>Fred Kirchenmann, author /farmer</B></P>
<H4>Consumer information </H4>
<P><B>Vote with your dollars.</B></P>
<P>Nationwide organic products continue to show improvement
in availability. Find organic products at supermarkets,
gourmet stores, and natural food stores including Fresh
Fields, Wild Oats, Alfalfa's Markets, Mrs. Gooch's, Whole Foods and others.</P>
<P>Organic products come in a wide variety: fruits,
vegetables, dairy products, baby food, frozen foods, cereals,
pastas, rice, soups, chips, coffee, tea, and even chocolate,
etc. </P>
<P>Health Valley is the largest organic food products
company in the world. In 1994, the company used 50 million
pounds of organic ingredients in its products. </P>
<P>Overall sales of all organic products have been
increasing over 20 percent per year since 1989. Total sales:
$2.3 billion in 1994 and <B>$3 billion</B> in 1995. </P>
<P>Purchase organic cotton clothing from companies like Blue
Fish Clothing, Patagonia or Ecosport. These companies are
responsible and help you be a responsible consumer. Ten
percent of the world's agricultural pesticides and 23 percent
of all the insecticides are used on cotton. U.S. farmers used
a billion pounds of nitrogen fertilizer on cotton in 1994.
</P>
<H4>In closing</H4>
<P>Most of us are not farmers or corporations -- we are citizens. As such we can
have a positive impact in change. As consumers and stewards
of our communities, yards and the collective heritage, we
play a major role in the future. </P>
<P><I>&quot;Ultimately, it comes back to ourselves to grow
peace, to find another pattern, to align with the rhythms of
change. We can work towards a planetary garden for everyone.
All our gardens are mosaical pieces of the living expression
from a monumental resource, the planetary gene pool. Our
lives are tied to the discovery process of humanity.&quot;
</I></P>

</CENTER><P>Is responsible business as profitable as other
approaches? Apparently, Yes. Consider the following: For a
six-year period (May 1990 through April 1996), the Domini 400
Social Index (DSI 400) returned 156.0% compared to 139.4% for
the S &amp; P 500 and 144.2% for the Russell 1000. </P>
<P>The DSI 400 is a market capitalization-weighted common
stock index monitoring the performance of 400 corporations
passing multiple, broad-based social screens. The DSI 400
consists of:</P>
<UL><LI>approximately 250 companies included in Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 Index</LI>
<LI>approximately 100 of the largest companies not included
in the S &amp; P 500</LI>
<LI>approximately 50 companies with particularly strong
social characteristics</LI>
<LI>several companies providing certain industry
representation</LI>
</UL>
<P>The DSI 400 is maintained by Kinder, Lydenberg &amp;
Domini (KLD). KLD provides social research on U.S.
corporations to the investment community and others. KLD
maintains a database of social research, consisting of the
results of the application of a broad range of social screens

<P>&#149; This Spring, socially concerned investors have an opportunity to send a message to management and use their economic power by voting their proxies. Companies will have included in their proxy statements shareholder resolutions on the environment, employment discrimination, human rights overseas, race and gender diversity on boards and many other issues. Read your proxies and vote for these resolutions. By doing so you vote for your conscience and let management know that you want them to improve their records on these important social justice issues. </P>

<P>Amy Domini, a leader in the SRI movement shares her insights, "Shareholder resolutions both encourage responsible behavior and corporate disclosure and discourage policies and practices that appear to be irresponsible or threaten the common good. In their efforts to affect change, shareholder activism highlights issues for management, shareholders and the public. Through shareholder resolutions, all stakeholders become involved in defining and shaping the appropriate impact of a corporation on society."</P>

<P>For more information on shareholder activism call Tim Smith at the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) at (212) 870-2295.</P>

<H4>FUTURE</H4>

<P>We've brought together two views on the future of SRI. The first article is from Gordon Telfer, VP of Murray Johnstone Intl. (MJI) based in Glasgow, Scotland &amp; Chicago, IL. The second article is from Carsten Henningsen, President of Progressive Securities based in Portland, OR.</P>

<H4>Catch-Up for 1996! [Global perspective] </H4>

<P><B>by Gordon Telfer</B></P>

<P>Following the impressive rise of the U.S. market through 1995, investors in 1996 will likely turn their attention to those international markets which have fallen behind. Looking around world economies, moderate growth coupled with low inflation promises another good year for equities in general.</P>

<P>More specifically, our investment strategy going into 1996 is to reduce exposure to the U.S. market. Our focus remains on Europe, where we expect economic growth to slow resulting in a cutting of interest rates across the continent, which will be positive for markets. The peripheral markets, such as Italy and Spain, we expect to respond best to lower interest rates. France had looked set to rise but now is under the shadow of worker protest which we see as a negative, prompting a shift away from this market.</P>

<P>On reviewing the other major markets, 1995 saw the low levels of capital invested outside the U.S. having a negative impact on the markets of Asia, in spite of steady growth in their economies. For 1996, since the value and growth prospects remain in place, we expect the correlation between the U.S. and Asia to return allowing Hong Kong and Singapore to move ahead. After a year in which the region did not shine in world terms, we believe 1996 will see Far East markets put in a much stronger performance and we intend to continue overweighting them.</P>

<P>The other area which lagged during 1995, at least in dollar terms, was Japan. The fundamentals of the market have been improving. This includes a pick-up of industrial production and government acceptance that support for the financial system is a prerequisite in the recovery of the broader economy. In 1995, we added to our exposure and for 1996 this will continue on our belief that the steady recovery of corporate profits will be accompanied by a relaxed monetary policy; promoting progress in the equity market. With signs of institutions looking more favorably on the Japanese market, the prospects are the best they have been since 1990. </P>

<H4>The Future of Socially Responsible Investing</H4>

<P><B>by Carsten Henningsen, President of Progressive Securities </B></P>

<P>	During the next century, the largest transfer of wealth in our history will occur. As this happens, the demand for investments that speak to our deepest values and beliefs will continue capturing the fascination of people around the world. In record numbers, the baby-boomer generation will seek investments and investment management expertise directed toward corporate responsibility. </P>

<P>	According to a 1995 Bernstein Research report, "Wealthy households made up of those aged 65 or older own 32% of all the individual equities held by households." As this generation passes away, the equities will be stepped up in basis, and will be transferred to a generation attuned to professional money management. While the exact size and timing of the inheritance process is subject to debate, it is clear that the demographic trends are very favorable for select managers.</P>

<P>	Demographic trends suggest that socially responsible investment managers will increasingly be among this group of select managers. As the environment continues to be a concern, investors will direct more and more of their assets to screened portfolios. Although the environment will most likely be the dominant issue among social investors, other issues such as human rights, employee relations, and weapons will also be at the forefront.</P>

<P>	Most important, community development lending and shareholder activism will become the actual tools of progressive social change. The next century will see an increase in the number of banks and lending institutions directed towards rebuilding economically depressed communities. Shareholder activism will be the voice of consciousness for changing the behavior of corporate America.</P>

<P><B>Catalyst</B>, a women's research organization recently
released a report titled Women in Corporate Leadership:
Progress and Prospects -1996. It is the first large-scale
national research study of women in corporate management,
presenting the corporate world according to the women who've
made it to the top. The report is based on Catalyst's survey
of 1251 executive women and CEO's of the Fortune 1000. The
report describes what leads to women's success and what holds
them back. </P>
<P>For information, to order their Perspectives newsletter,
or the research report call (212) 777-8900.</P>
<P><B>National Foundation of Women Business Owners
(NFWBO)</B> recently released a report titled 1996 Facts on
Women-Owned Businesses. The study found 8 million women-owned
businesses in the U.S. with a total of 18.5 million
employees. Those women-owned firms now employ one out of
every four workers in the U.S. Annual sales generated by
those businesses approximately is $2.3 trillion. Another
report available is Women-Owned Businesses: Breaking the
Boundaries, The Progress and Achievement of Women-owned
Enterprises - 1995. Their annual NFWBO/Gillian Rudd

government and society in general. An overview of the status
of women and minorities in the nation workforce. It also
encourages companies to release their diversity data. A Glass
Ceiling report note: 57% workforce is women or minorities,

<CENTER><P><B>Jennifer James, Thinking in the Future
Tense</B></P>
</CENTER><P>Following are events on corporate responsibility
from Washington, D.C. and the Clinton Administration: </P>
<P>In March, Sustainable America: A New Consensus for
Prosperity, Opportunity, and a Healthy Environment for the
Future report was completed by The President's Council on
Sustainable Development (PCSD). The President received the
report in March and will be given a status report on the
implementation phase in December. The 36-page executive
summary covers several different areas including: National
goals towards sustainable development, Building a new
framework for a new century, Information and education,
Strengthening communities, Natural resources stewardship,
U.S. population and sustainability as well as International
labor. The executive summary is available by calling (202)
408-5296 or the full text of the report can be accessed
online on the PCSD web site at <A
href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/pcsd">
http://www.whitehouse.gov/pcsd </A> .</P>
<P>In May, President Clinton, Vice President Gore and
several Cabinet members held a all-day conference on
Corporate Responsibility. The President invited 100 CEO's to
the White House and Georgetown University to discuss the
administration's role in defining Standards for Corporate
Responsibility, and to show their commitment to promoting and
creating incentives for these types of standards. Discussions
were held on corporate citizenship, family-friendly
workplaces, employee education and training,
employer-employee partnerships, the values that drive
responsible companies and of course, balancing work and
family needs. </P>
<P>President Clinton (as he had done earlier in the year on
his weekly radio address) outlined his five elements of
corporate citizenship at the conference. They are: 1)
building family-friendly companies, 2) providing health and
retirement security, 3) creating safe and secure workplaces,
4) investing in employees, 5) developing partnerships with
employees. The President also announced the new Ron Brown
Corporate Citizenship Award.</P>
<P>Several members of the responsible business community
were invited including Bob Dunn of BSR, Yvon Chouinard of
Patagonia, Fran Sussner Rogers of Work/Family Directions,
Gary Hirshberg of Stonyfield Yogurt, Gun Denhart of Hanna
Andersson, and Howard Schultz of Starbucks Coffee. Time
magazine covered the meeting with an article titled
&quot;Good for the Bottom Line.&quot; </P>
<P>The Department of Labor held a public hearing on
International Child Labor in June and a Fashion Industry
Forum in July. The fashion forum was attended by over 500
industry representatives. The forum had heightened media
attention with the presence of Kathy Lee Gifford, discussing
her recent problems with child labor /sweatshop manufacturing
of her clothing line at Wal-Mart. The Interfaith Center on
Corporate Responsibility's David Schilling attended both
events and spoke at the public hearing. He also spoke with
Labor Secretary Robert Reich about how the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) is preventing shareholder
resolutions on international labor standards and global codes
of conduct from going forth. Companies like Levi Strauss,
Reebok, and the Gap all have global supplier /sourcing
standards, especially on the use of child labor. Labor
Secretary Robert Reich has made a commitment to doing away
with sweatshops, awarding responsible retailers and working
with the SEC. For more information call ICCR in New York at
(212) 870-2295.</P>
<H4>CLOSING:</H4>
<P>In closing, as you process what is offered make sure and
have some fun. You could start by reading the new Dilbert
cartoon book on management called The Dilbert Principle
(Harper Business, 1996). Dilbert and his creator Scott Adams
have been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Inc.
and most recently on the cover of Business Ethics
(July/August 1996). Also checkout and bookmark, The Dilbert
Zone web site at-

<P><I>Beliefs drive strategy. Your ethics can form the
foundation of smart analysis and clear thinking. Your
personal values can be integrated with managing for all the
traditional goals of business {Special Char 209 in Font
&quot;Times&quot;}making money, expanded market share,
increased profits, retained earnings, and sales growth. Not
only can your personal beliefs be brought to work, they can
work for you.</I></P>
<CENTER><P><B>Tom Chappell, Tom's of Maine </B></P>
</CENTER><P><I>For many CEO's of socially responsible
companies, doing business in a good way is simply good
business. If you're running a company in a respectable way --
respectful of your employees, customers, community, and
environment -- then that will come back and create an
economic benefit for you in the long haul. There's a link
between company profitability and responsible corporate
practices.</I></P>

<P><B>Change Points:</B></P>
<P>1) The American Medical Association's (AMA) recent call
for divestment from 14 major tobacco companies and almost
1500 mutual funds with tobacco holdings was - to say the
least - impressive. Perhaps soon they should do the same to
Alcohol manufacturers? Health professionals know the mammoth
price paid by society for alcohol related driving accidents
and diseases.</P>
<P>2) Burma and its Government/Military Dictatorship is
target of international boycotts and possible sanctions
because of human rights violations. U.S. companies still
doing business in Burma include Pepsi, Texaco and Unocal.
Pepsi is facing an international student-led consumer boycott
and lost a $1 million contract at Harvard due to its business
activities in Burma. Other actions include: City &amp; State
government purchasing restrictions and a series of
shareholder resolutions from religious and socially-conscious
investors. </P>
<P>3) America's 100 Best Corporate Citizens were recently
named by Business Ethics magazine in their (May/June 1996
issue). Their top ten: Campbell Soup, Adolph Coors,
Microsoft, H.B. Fuller, Medtronic, Norwest, Consolidated
Freightways, York International, Wholesome and Hearty Foods,
and Frontier Corporation.</P>
<P>4) Other changes of note: </P>
<P>Protests at the Nike store in Portland, Oregon</P>
<P>Harassment lawsuit at Mitsubishi Motors</P>
<P>The media's increased coverage of corporate
responsibility issues.</P>
<P><I>Whether in Paris, Texas or Paris, France, we all want
to have good jobs where we are needed and respected and paid
just a little more then we deserve.</I></P>

<H1><CENTER>Nu m&aring;ste vi f&aring; fart p&aring; nyf&ouml;retagandet</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4>Nyf&ouml;retagandet i Sverige m&aring;ste utvecklas f&ouml;r att den
n&ouml;dv&auml;ndiga tillv&auml;xten<BR>
ska uppn&aring;s. I Nyk&ouml;ping &auml;r behovet s&auml;rskilt stort samtidigt
som vi har sm&aring;<BR>
ekonomiska resurser till v&aring;rt f&ouml;rfogande. Vi beh&ouml;ver nu
ditt st&ouml;d f&ouml;r att kunna<BR>
bedriva en effektiv r&aring;dgivning och utbildning av nya f&ouml;retagare.
Det &auml;r en<BR>
grundl&auml;ggande policy inom Jobs &amp; Society att alla Nyf&ouml;retagarcentra
(drygt<BR>
70 st i Sverige) ska finansieras genom sponsring fr&aring;n det etablerade<BR>
n&auml;ringslivet.<BR>
<HR></H4>
<H2>Nyf&ouml;retagarcentrum i Nyk&ouml;ping</H2>
<H4>Nyf&ouml;retagarcentrum (NC) ser som sin uppgift att stimulera nyf&ouml;retagandet
i<BR>
Nyk&ouml;ping. Detta sker genom kvalificerad r&aring;dgivning till personer
med drivkraft<BR>
och intresse f&ouml;r att starta en egen verksamhet. NC ska vara den instans
som<BR>
&auml;r naturlig f&ouml;r en entrepren&ouml;r att s&ouml;ka r&aring;dgivning
hos i samband med<BR>
f&ouml;retagsstart.<BR>
<BR>
H&auml;r finns stor kunskap och erfarenhet om entrepren&ouml;rskap och f&ouml;rst&aring;else
f&ouml;r<BR>
nyf&ouml;retagandets villkor. Att vi &auml;r &quot;b&auml;st p&aring; nyf&ouml;retagande&quot;
framg&aring;r tydligt av<BR>
statistiken &ouml;ver andelen lyckade starter av nya f&ouml;retag. Genom
v&aring;r r&aring;dgivning<BR>
hittar man fram till ekonomiskt framkomliga verksamheter och undviker on&ouml;diga<BR>
problem.<BR>
<HR></H4>
<H2>Finansiering</H2>
<H4>Ditt st&ouml;d till NC ger oss m&ouml;jligheter att ge kostnadsfri r&aring;dgivning
till<BR>
nyf&ouml;retagare p&aring; ett professionellt s&auml;tt. Med v&aring;r l&aring;nga
erfarenhet av<BR>
entrepren&ouml;rer och deras villkor i samh&auml;llet har vi l&auml;tt f&ouml;r
att f&ouml;rst&aring; och<BR>
kommunicera med dem. Vi hj&auml;lper dem att fila p&aring; sina aff&auml;rsid&eacute;er
s&aring; att de<BR>
hittar r&auml;tt till sina m&aring;lgrupper.<BR>
<BR>
Med ditt bidrag ger du oss m&ouml;jligheter att hj&auml;lpa flera engagerade
m&auml;nniskor<BR>
att f&ouml;rverkliga sina dr&ouml;mmar om ett eget f&ouml;retag. Genom v&aring;rt
arbete med<BR>
nyf&ouml;retagare bidrar vi &auml;ven till en l&aring;ngsiktig kulturf&ouml;r&auml;ndring
i Nyk&ouml;ping i<BR>
riktning mot en st&ouml;rre respekt och v&auml;lvilja mot f&ouml;retagande
och enskilda<BR>
initiativ av olika slag.<BR>
<BR>
Kommun och andra offentliga organ bidrar med mindre &auml;n h&auml;lften
av bidragen.<BR>
F&ouml;r att &aring;stadkomma det &ouml;kade nyf&ouml;retagande, som Nyk&ouml;ping
s&aring; v&auml;l beh&ouml;ver,<BR>
m&aring;ste nu ytterligare sponsorer tr&auml;da in.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>DETTA &Auml;R JOBS &amp; SOCIETY <BR>
<HR></CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><BR>
Jobs &amp; Society &auml;r en del av ett internationellt n&auml;tverk av
f&ouml;retag, organisationer<BR>
och institutioner med uppgift att stimulera och st&ouml;dja nya initiativ
som fr&auml;mjar<BR>
entrepren&ouml;rskap och skapander av nya jobb i nya f&ouml;retag. <BR>
<BR>
Jobs &amp; Society skapades p&aring; iniativ av Pehr G Gyllenhammar genom
dennes<BR>
engagemang i Aspen Institutet. <BR>
<BR>
Svenska Jobs &amp; Society har fr&auml;mst inriktat verksamheten p&aring;
att efter brittisk<BR>
f&ouml;rebild initiera och medverka till uppbyggnaden av Nyf&ouml;retagarcentra
runt om i<BR>
landet. <BR>
</H4>
<H2>V&auml;gledande principer </H2>
<H4><BR>
* Lokalt n&auml;ringsliv &auml;r huvudkraften i driften och finansiering.
<BR>
<BR>
* Samarbete sker med organisationer, lokala och centrala myndigheter samt<BR>
offentliga organ. <BR>
<BR>
* R&aring;dgivande n&auml;tverk med experter och f&ouml;retagare &auml;r
den viktigaste resursen. <BR>
<BR>
1985 &ouml;ppnades Sveriges f&ouml;rsta Nyf&ouml;retagarcentrum - Ronneby
Etableringscenter.<BR>
1996 finns det 72 st. och fler &auml;r under uppbyggnad. <BR>
<BR>
1994 startades ca 5.000 f&ouml;retag med hj&auml;lp av svenska Nyf&ouml;retagarcentra.<BR>
&Ouml;verlevnaden &auml;r h&ouml;g. Konkursfrekvensen ligger runt fem procent.
<BR>
</H4>
<H2>Kostnadsfri r&aring;dgivning </H2>
<H4><BR>
Genom ett nyf&ouml;retagarcentrum ges den som vill starta ett eget f&ouml;retag
kostnadsfri<BR>
och konfidentiell r&aring;dgivning. <BR>
<BR>
R&aring;dgivningen ges genom ett n&auml;tverk av f&ouml;retagare och experter
p&aring; olika omr&aring;den. <BR>
<BR>
Stiftelsen Svenska Jobs &amp; Society bedriver informationsverksamhet, seminarier,<BR>
temasammankomster och arrangerar &auml;ven studieresor i och utanf&ouml;r
Sverige. <BR>
<BR>
Nyhetsbrevet &quot;Nyf&ouml;retagaren&quot; &auml;r det fr&auml;msta informationsmedlet
inom det n&auml;tverk<BR>
av personer, f&ouml;retag och organisationer som byggts upp.<BR>

SWN.</A></I></H3>
<H4><BR>
Projektet genomf&ouml;rdes v&aring;ren 1996. H&auml;r nedan finns en kortare
sammanst&auml;llning av de olika projektfaserna som skrevs inf&ouml;r och
under projektet. Vi rekommenderar<BR>
l&auml;nken, som har en tydligare struktur och d&auml;r n&aring;gra bilder
ocks&aring; finns.</H4>
<H3>Trainee-program f&ouml;r kvinnor som vill starta eget.</H3>
<H4>Nyf&ouml;retagarcentrum i Nyk&ouml;ping har f&aring;tt ett pilotprojekt
via NUTEK, att genomf&ouml;ra ett trainee-program f&ouml;r kvinnor.</H4>
<H3>Syfte och m&aring;l</H3>
<H4>Syftet med projektet &auml;r att erbjuda kvinnor en m&ouml;jlighet att
f&aring; insikt om hur det &auml;r att vara egen f&ouml;retagare under en
dag i veckan i sex m&aring;nader.<BR>
M&aring;let &auml;r att f&aring; dessa kvinnor att starta eget f&ouml;retag
(eller att avst&aring;).</H4>
<H3>Trainee-f&ouml;retag</H3>
<H4>&#183; Du &auml;r f&ouml;retagare eller<BR>
&#183; Du &auml;r f&ouml;retagsledare<BR>
&#183; Du vill ta emot en trainee<BR>
<BR>
Projektet v&auml;nder sig till f&ouml;retag som &auml;r villiga att ta emot
en trainee under projekttiden. Det &auml;r inget som hindrar att trainee-f&ouml;retaget
har n&aring;gon/n&aring;gra som skulle vilja vara trainees p&aring; ett
annat f&ouml;retag. Insatsen blir ca 1 dag per m&aring;nad och avsikten
&auml;r att en person ska f&aring; m&ouml;jlighet att delta i verksamheten
p&aring; det s&auml;tt som trainee-f&ouml;retaget kan arrangera. Att ta
emot denna trainee &auml;r en ideell insats och bel&ouml;ningen &auml;r
att fr&auml;mja nyf&ouml;retagandet.<BR>
<BR>
Projektledningen kommer naturligtvis att f&ouml;lja projektet under den
tid det p&aring;g&aring;r.<BR>
En uppf&ouml;ljning efter projektet kommer ocks&aring; att g&ouml;ras f&ouml;r
utv&auml;rdering till NUTEK.</H4>
<H3>Vem kan bli trainee?</H3>
<H4>&#183; Du &auml;r kvinna<BR>
&#183; Du &auml;r anst&auml;lld<BR>
&#183; Du vill bli egen f&ouml;retagare<BR>
<BR>
Projektet v&auml;nder sig till kvinnor som idag &auml;r anst&auml;llda och
som har funderingar p&aring; att vilja starta eget. Det finns inga villkor
f&ouml;rknippade till inom vilken bransch den blivande traineen funderar
p&aring; att starta.<BR>
<BR>
F n finns det ingen extra st&ouml;ttning p&aring; just den m&aring;lgruppen,
varf&ouml;r steget fr&aring;n att ge upp en anst&auml;llning och ge sig
ut p&aring; ok&auml;nt vatten genom att starta eget &auml;r mycket stort.<BR>
<BR>
I detta pilotprojekt ing&aring;r ej arbetsl&ouml;sa kvinnor, men om projektutv&auml;rderingen
blir positiv kan kanske &auml;ven denna m&aring;lgrupp komma ifr&aring;ga
senare. Just nu &auml;r det allts&aring; ej aktuellt.</H4>
<H3>Projekttid</H3>
<H4>Projekttiden &auml;r under 6 m&aring;nader under perioden januari --
juni 1996.<BR>
Under h&ouml;sten 1995 arbetade vi med marknadsf&ouml;ring av projektet
i Nyk&ouml;ping, f&ouml;r att hitta ca 10 kvinnor som vill delta.</H4>
<H3>Vad kostar det?</H3>
<H4>Att delta i projektet f&ouml;r den kvinnliga traineen &auml;r utan kostnad.<BR>
Ev. uppg&ouml;relse med nuvarande arbetsgivare betr&auml;ffande betald eller
obetald ledighet f&ouml;r att medverka i projektet blir en &ouml;verenskommelse
som dessa parter sj&auml;lva kommer &ouml;verens om.<BR>
<BR>
Att st&auml;lla upp som trainee-f&ouml;retag och ta emot en trainee sker
p&aring; ideell grund och n&aring;gon ers&auml;ttning utg&aring;r ej. Det
finns inga som helst f&ouml;rpliktelser f&ouml;r framtida &aring;taganden
fr&aring;n n&aring;gondera part annat &auml;n medverkan i utv&auml;rdering
och ev s&aring;dant som &ouml;verenskommits p&aring; frivillig basis.</H4>
<H3>Start</H3>
<H4>Trainee-programmet startar med en genomg&aring;ng av m&ouml;jligheter
och problem n&auml;r det g&auml;ller att driva eget f&ouml;retag. Vi kommer
att bjuda in b&aring;de de utvalda trainee-kvinnorna och trainee-f&ouml;retagen
till minst ett halvdags gemensamt seminarium.</H4>
<H3>Genomf&ouml;rande</H3>
<H4>Genomf&ouml;randet av programmet p&aring; f&ouml;retaget blir en sammanv&auml;vning
av teori och praktik. Den teoretiska delen blir i gruppundervisning i Nyf&ouml;retagarcentrums
lokaler och kommer att omfatta f&ouml;ljande:<BR>
<BR>
&#183; Ekonomi<BR>
&#183; Data<BR>
&#183; Marknadsf&ouml;ring<BR>
&#183; Personligt ledarskap<BR>
&#183; Starta och driva eget<BR>
&#183; Entrepren&ouml;rskontakter<BR>
<BR>
I anslutning till dessa block ska traineen f&aring; information om hur trainee-f&ouml;retaget
l&ouml;st dessa fr&aring;gor. B&aring;de teori och praktik kommer att ske
p&aring; m&aring;ndagar under projekttiden.</H4>
<H3>Projektledning</H3>
<H4>Projektledare f&ouml;r detta projekt &auml;r Gunnel Thunstr&ouml;m,
ordf&ouml;rande och r&aring;dgivare p&aring; Nyf&ouml;retagarcentrum i Nyk&ouml;ping.<BR>
<BR>
I marknadsbearbetningen, som vi startade i september deltar ocks&aring;
Inger Gran, Eductus. F&ouml;re &aring;rsskiftet planerar vi att ha hittat
v&aring;ra kvinnliga trainee-deltagare och trainee-f&ouml;retag.</H4>
<H3>Fr&aring;gor - NUTEK &auml;r speciellt intresserade av att f&aring;
svar p&aring; f&ouml;ljande:</H3>
<H4>1. &Auml;r f&ouml;retagen intresserade av att ta emot trainees och l&auml;gga
tid p&aring; dem enligt ett strukturerat program? Finns idealism, eller
kr&auml;ver man ers&auml;ttning?<BR>
<BR>
2. &Auml;r traineen intresserad av att &quot;offra en dagsf&ouml;rtj&auml;nst
i veckan&quot; mot gl&auml;djen att f&aring; strukturerad praktik i ett
f&ouml;retag och bygga upp en ny framtid?<BR>
<BR>
<HR></H4>
<H3>TRAINEE-program f&ouml;r kvinnor -<BR>
Det informationsbrev till blivande TRAINEE-f&ouml;retag som vi skrev</H3>
<H4><BR>
Tack f&ouml;r att du visat intresse f&ouml;r v&aring;rt TRAINEE-program
f&ouml;r kvinnor som vill<BR>
starta eget och att du f&ouml;rhoppningsvis blir intresserad av att st&auml;lla
upp som<BR>
TRAINEE-f&ouml;retag till en av de deltagande kvinnorna i v&aring;rt TRAINEE-program.<BR>
(En folder som presenterade programmet fanns ocks&aring; med tillsammans
med en<BR>
sammanst&auml;llning &ouml;ver de olika kvinnornas aff&auml;rsi&eacute;er.)</H4>
<H3><BR>
Vilka kan bli TRAINEE-f&ouml;retag?</H3>
<H4><BR>
V&aring;r strategi att hitta trainee-f&ouml;retag &auml;r att vi tillsammans
med<BR>
projektdeltagarna ska hitta l&auml;mpliga f&ouml;retag. Vi har bed&ouml;mt
det som<BR>
synnerligen viktigt att TRAINEE-deltagaren sj&auml;lv har f&aring;tt vara
med och v&auml;lja<BR>
och f&ouml;resl&aring; f&ouml;retag som de k&auml;nner att de kommer att
ha nytta av i sin framtida<BR>
verksamhet.</H4>
<H3>&Ouml;verenskommelse</H3>
<H4><BR>
N&aring;gon ers&auml;ttning utg&aring;r ej till TRAINEE-f&ouml;retaget.
&Aring;tagandet bygger helt p&aring;<BR>
ideella insatser. Vi kommer &ouml;verens (brev eller telefon) med TRAINEE-f&ouml;retaget<BR>
d&auml;r tidsperioder enligt nedan och deltagarens namn framg&aring;r.</H4>
<H3>Tidsperiod</H3>
<H4><BR>
Projektperioden f&ouml;r TRAINEE-deltagaren &auml;r 15 jan -- 17 juni 1996.
Den faktiska<BR>
perioden blir d&auml;rmed ca 5 m&aring;nader. 10 m&aring;ndagar &auml;r
TRAINEE-dagar p&aring;<BR>
f&ouml;retag och 10 dagar &auml;r i grupp i v&aring;ra lokaler.<BR>
<BR>
Avslutningsdagen den 17 juni, blir en inspirationstr&auml;ff p&aring; Torps
s&auml;teri, Bettna,<BR>
utanf&ouml;r Nyk&ouml;ping, med lunch, studiebes&ouml;k och f&ouml;redrag
av Amie Lindahl<BR>
Norberg och Thord Ne&uuml;muller. Alla som har medverkat i programmet inbjuds
till<BR>
den aktiviteten kl 11.00 - 16.00.</H4>
<H3>TRAINEE-dagar och inneh&aring;ll</H3>
<H4><BR>
Aktuella TRAINEE-dagar (om annat ej &ouml;verenskoms med TRAINEE-deltagaren):<BR>
11 mar, 25 mar, 1 apr, 15 apr, 29 apr, 6 maj, 20 maj och 3&nbsp;jun.<BR>
<BR>
Vi planerar att TRAINEE-dagarna ska omfatta hela dagen hos f&ouml;retaget,
men<BR>
att TRAINEE-deltagaren ocks&aring; ska kunna arbeta med det egna f&ouml;retaget<BR>
under sj&auml;lva TRAINEE-dagen och g&ouml;ra vissa marknadsunders&ouml;kningar
och<BR>
f&ouml;rberedelser. Detta f&ouml;r att inte fresta tidsm&auml;ssigt f&ouml;r
h&aring;rt p&aring; TRAINEE-f&ouml;retagsledaren.<BR>
<BR>
TRAINEE-deltagarna f&aring;r ocks&aring; tr&auml;ffa ett 15-tal olika f&ouml;retagare
under de 10<BR>
dagarna i grupp. De kommer d&aring; bl&nbsp;a att ber&auml;tta om sig sj&auml;lva
som f&ouml;retagare,<BR>
varf&ouml;r de startade, problem och gl&auml;dje&auml;mnen m m.</H4>
<H3>Hur ska TRAINEE-delen g&aring; till?</H3>
<H4><BR>
Vi kan inte beskriva hur TRAINEE-delen i f&ouml;retaget generellt ska se
ut eftersom<BR>
TRAINEE-deltagaren m&aring;ste f&aring; g&ouml;ra upp detta tillsammans
med TRAINEE-f&ouml;retagaren. M&aring;let &auml;r att TRAINEE-deltagaren
ska f&ouml;rs&ouml;ka l&auml;ra sig s&aring; mycket som m&ouml;jligt av
TRAINEE-f&ouml;retagaren f&ouml;r att hon ska kunna till&auml;mpa det i
det egna f&ouml;retaget.<BR>
<BR>
TRAINEE-deltagarna fick f&ouml;rsta dagen ber&auml;tta om sina f&ouml;rv&auml;ntningar
och en<BR>
r&ouml;d tr&aring;d var att alla ville l&auml;ra sig ekonomi, marknadsf&ouml;ring
och data.<BR>
<BR>
Eftersom jag av erfarenhet vet att det i nyf&ouml;retagarsammanhang &auml;r
synnerligen<BR>
viktigt att l&auml;gga tonvikten p&aring; ekonomi och marknadsf&ouml;ring
&auml;r det dessa &auml;mnen<BR>
som vi har som teoridelar med tyngre pass. Ekonomipassen &auml;r nu avslutade
och<BR>
vi har lagt in extra utbildning inom data p&aring; kv&auml;llstid.<BR>
<BR>
TRAINEE-deltagaren kommer d&auml;rmed att f&aring; grundf&ouml;ruts&auml;ttningar
f&ouml;r att kunna<BR>
tillgodog&ouml;ra sig de olika system och metoder som de olika TRAINEE-f&ouml;retagen<BR>
till&auml;mpar.<BR>
<BR>
Avsikten &auml;r att TRAINEE-delen ska f&ouml;lja upp de fr&aring;gor som
vi haft f&ouml;rel&auml;sning<BR>
om eller har diskuterat i stor grupp. Detaljerna g&ouml;r resp f&ouml;retag
och TRAINEE<BR>
upp om.<BR>
<BR>
Vi hoppas att dessa rader har gett en bild av hur projektet &auml;r t&auml;nkt
och att du<BR>
ska bli intresserad av att st&auml;lla upp som TRAINEE-f&ouml;retag. Vi
s&ouml;ker f&ouml;retag<BR>
inom en radie av ca 10 mil vilket betyder att ocks&aring; stockholmsf&ouml;retag
&auml;r<BR>
intressanta.<BR>

DELRAPPORT TILL NUTEK I MARS 1996</H2>
<H4><BR>
V&aring;r strategi att hitta trainee-f&ouml;retag har varit att vi tillsammans
med<BR>
projektdeltagarna skulle hitta l&auml;mpliga f&ouml;retag. Vi har bed&ouml;mt
det som<BR>
synnerligen viktigt att TRAINEE-deltagaren sj&auml;lv har f&aring;tt vara
med och v&auml;lja<BR>
och f&ouml;resl&aring; f&ouml;retag som de k&auml;nde att de skulle ha nytta
av i sin framtida<BR>
verksamhet. De flesta trainee-f&ouml;retagen har tillkommit under projektets
g&aring;ng<BR>
vartefter olika &ouml;nskem&aring;l har f&ouml;rts fram av trainee-deltagarna.<BR>
<BR>
Vi har gjort en separat sammanst&auml;llning &ouml;ver TRAINEE-f&ouml;retag
och de personer<BR>
som st&auml;llt upp i v&aring;rt TRAINEE-program som f&ouml;rel&auml;sare
m m. Det har ocks&aring; visat sig att n&aring;gra f&ouml;retag endast har
kunnat/velat bidra med<BR>
n&aring;gon dag och d&aring; har vi utnyttjat ocks&aring; detta erbjudande.</H4>
<H3>Att hitta trainee-f&ouml;retag</H3>
<H4><BR>
Efter som inte n&aring;gon ers&auml;ttning har utg&aring;tt till TRAINEE-f&ouml;retaget
har det inte<BR>
varit helt l&auml;tt att f&aring; f&ouml;retag att st&auml;lla upp.<BR>
<BR>
Det har visat sig att jag som projektledare till st&ouml;rsta delen har
utnyttjat mitt<BR>
professionella n&auml;tverk n&auml;r jag har lyckats f&aring; f&ouml;retagen
att st&auml;lla upp. I n&aring;gra<BR>
fall har trainee-deltagarna sj&auml;lva uttryckt &ouml;nskem&aring;l om
f&ouml;retag och d&aring; har jag<BR>
bidragit med kontaktskapandet och i n&aring;gra fall har traineen sj&auml;lv
b&aring;de hittat<BR>
och sj&auml;lv tagit kontakt som resulterat i ett trainee-f&ouml;retag.</H4>
<H3>Tidsperiod</H3>
<H4><BR>
I de flesta fallen har planerad m&aring;ndag anv&auml;nts som trainee-dag,
men i n&aring;gra<BR>
fall har f&ouml;retag och trainee-deltagare &ouml;verenskommit om annan
dag som<BR>
passat b&aring;da b&auml;ttre. I ett fall intensifierades trainee-dagarna
till 3 i f&ouml;ljd i och<BR>
med att hon fick delta i en utbildning p&aring; f&ouml;retaget. Hittills
har det inte varit<BR>
n&aring;gra som helst problem som har dykt upp i samband med trainee-f&ouml;retag
och<BR>
trainee-deltagare. Deltagarna har varit mycket flitiga och det har endast
varit n&aring;gra enstaka fr&aring;nvarotillf&auml;llen.</H4>
<H3>Extra aktiviteter och utbildning</H3>
<H4><BR>
MINO &shyp; Marknadsf&ouml;reningen h&auml;r i Nyk&ouml;ping bj&ouml;d in
projektdeltagarna till en<BR>
aktivitet, som de hade f&ouml;r sina medlemmar och 5 st deltog i ett f&ouml;redrag
om<BR>
team-building och middag en kv&auml;ll.<BR>
<BR>
Ut&ouml;ver kursprogrammet har vi ocks&aring; arrangerat en separat datautbildning
tv&aring;<BR>
kv&auml;llar som Office h&ouml;ll i. 6 st deltog i denna utbildning.<BR>
<BR>
Utv&auml;rdering har skett/sker kontinuerligt och anv&auml;nds som ett operativt
verktyg<BR>
i den fortsatta utvecklingen av projektet.<BR>

<H4>Inbjudan skickades i mitten av februari 1996 till personalchefer, utbildningsansvariga
m&nbsp;fl i S&ouml;dermanland. Projektet startade i mitten av maj med en
f&ouml;rsta tr&auml;ff p&aring; Hotell Blommenhof och &auml;r nu i full
g&aring;ng.<BR>
<BR>
Inom ramen f&ouml;r l&auml;nsstyrelsens projekt Utvidgat Regionalt Resurscentrum
ska<BR>
ett antal delprojekt riktade till kvinnor genomf&ouml;ras i l&auml;net.<BR>
<BR>
L&auml;nsstyrelsen har beslutat att anlita Nyf&ouml;retagarcentrum i Nyk&ouml;ping
f&ouml;r att<BR>
genomf&ouml;ra delprojektet Mentorskap f&ouml;r kvinnor inom offentlig sektor.
<BR>
<BR>
Detta sker genom att Nyf&ouml;retagarcentrum knutit <A HREF="mailto:helena.svahn@verksamutveckling.se">Helena

TBV har under senare &aring;r utvecklat en v&auml;l fungerande modell f&ouml;r
arbetsmilj&ouml;utbildning d&auml;r studier och l&auml;rande v&auml;vs in
i det praktiska f&ouml;r&auml;ndringsarbetet. Modellen bygger p&aring; samverkan
mellan arbetsgivare och fack, och syftar till att lyfta fram de anst&auml;lldas
engagemang och kunskap i utvecklingsarbetet. Att p&aring; olika s&auml;tt
skapa f&ouml;ruts&auml;ttningar f&ouml;r delaktighet, ansvar och samarbete.
<BR>
<BR>
V&aring;r modell har visat sig vara ett utm&auml;rkt redskap f&ouml;r att
inf&ouml;ra internkontroll och arbetsplatstr&auml;ffar i en organisation
p&aring; ett s&auml;tt som byggt upp engagemang och kompetens hos b&aring;de
ledning och personal. Och som leder till verkliga och praktiska f&ouml;r&auml;ndringar.<BR>

Svenska Distansh&ouml;gskolan har startats av TBV, Utbildningsradion och
h&ouml;gskolor runt om i landet. Den inneb&auml;r att man kan studera oavsett
&aring;lder, bostadsort och k&ouml;n! Studierna bygger p&aring; ett stort
m&aring;tt av sj&auml;lvst&auml;ndighet, d&auml;r man sj&auml;lv best&auml;mmer
studietakt och ambitionsniv&aring;. Studierna &auml;r idealiska f&ouml;r
den som yrkesarbetar, bor i glesbygd eller av andra sk&auml;l har sv&aring;rt
att f&ouml;lja l&auml;rarledd undervisning i traditionell bem&auml;rkelse.<BR>
<BR>
Kurserna ger deltagaren m&ouml;jlighet att h&ouml;ja sin kompetens inom
olika omr&aring;den. Vi har startat med kurser inom informationsteknik och
europakunskap.<BR>
<BR>
Handledaren skall &ouml;vervaka aktiviteten i studiegruppen och f&ouml;rs&auml;kra
sig om att alla deltagare deltar aktivt i studierna och d&aring; deltagarna
&quot;k&ouml;r fast&quot; skall handledaren g&aring; in och hj&auml;lpa
till med probleml&ouml;sningen. Tanken &auml;r att man skapar ett virtuellt
studentliv d&auml;r deltagarna studerar och &quot;umg&aring;s&quot; i en
elektronisk studentkorridor (studiegruppens konferens) eller den virtuella
h&ouml;gskolan (hela FirstClass - konferensen).<BR>
<BR>

<P>The purpose of melting low-level metals is to recycle valuable materials and
save expensive space at final disposal facilities. Since it is only the
resulting slag and ash from the melting process which must be disposed of, the
volume of waste is considerably reduced. After melting, the material can,
directly or after interim storage to allow for radioactive decay, be relaesed

<BODY><H1>Pyrolysis</H1>
<H2>A Cost-Effective Volume Reduction of Ion Exchange Resins</H2>
<H3>Radioactive Spent Resin</H3>
<P>Processing, storage and the ultimate disposal of low- and medium level waste
is a significant portion of a nuclear plant`s overall operational budget. Of
significance is the volume of ion exchange resins generated by nuclear power
plants. This resins is a waste stream that is costly for the utilities to
manage.</P>
<H3>Pyrolysis</H3>
<P>Pyrolysis is a low temperature thermal process that operates at
approximately 550&#176;C and significantly reduces the initial volume of spent
ion exchange resins. The relatively low temperature applied in an
underpressurized process prevents the radioactive metals from volatizing, thus
retaining the radioactive nuclides and sulfides in the pyrolysis residue. When a
pyrolysis process is applied to ion exchange resins the long chain polymer resin
material is disassociated into a solid residue, 1/3 of the resin weight, and the
gas fraction, 2/3 of the resin weight. </P>
<P>The advantages of the process are:</P>
<UL COMPACT="COMPACT"><LI>a significant volume reduction of the waste</LI>
<LI>a biological and chemichal end product ( solid pyrolysis residue)</LI>
<LI>an almost total retention of radioactivity in the pyrolysis residue, thus
preventing secondary and tertiary radioactive waste.</LI></UL> 
<P>The conclusion is that a process for the treatment of ion exchange resin by
pyrolysis has been developed and proved by experimnet to comply with:</P>
<UL COMPACT="COMPACT"><LI>waste volume reduction by a factor of 10</LI>
<LI>an almost geochemically stable end product</LI>
<LI>a radioactivity retention factor of 10E6, which excludes or severely limits
the amounts of radioactive secondary waste.</LI></UL>

a total of four projects about <A HREF="http://www.geirik.is/eko-1">ecology and

long-lived low and intermediate level radioactive waste [2].</P>
<P>An important overall objective with the NKS projects is to help create
similar Nordic attitudes to essential safety issues. A specific objective with
the waste project is to give authorities and waste producers in the Nordic
countries background material for determinations about the management and
disposal of long-lived low and intermediate level radioactive waste [2].</P>
<H2>Long-Lived Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Waste in the Nordic
Countries</H2>
<P>The project participants are from the Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, Norway and Sweden. All these countries have long-lived low and
intermediate level radioactive waste. The waste originates from:</P>
<UL COMPACT="COMPACT"><LI> power reactors (Finland, Sweden)</LI>
<LI> research reactors(Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden)</LI>
<LI> medicine, research and industry(Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden)</LI></UL>
     
<P>Denmark has interim storage facilities for radioactive waste at the research
centre Ris&oslash;, but has not started the planning work for final disposal.
The long-lived low and intermediate level radioactive waste in </P>
<P>Finland will probably be deposited in repositories for decommissioning
waste. The Finnish utilities plan to build such repositories near the reactor
waste repositories in Lovisa and Olkiluoto. Iceland has only small quantities of
radioactive waste from hospitals and industry. For the long-lived waste,
international waste disposal solutions can be considered. Norway will build a
combined disposal and storage facility for radioactive waste. At closure of the
facility, it will be decided whether to retrieve the stored waste or to convert
this part of the facility into a repository (encasing with concrete). The
long-lived low and intermediate level radioactive waste in Sweden will,
according to plans, be stored in the deep underground repositories SFL 3-5.</P>
<H2>Three Sub-projects</H2>
<P>The NKS waste project about the safety of the final disposal of long-lived
low and intermediate level radioactive waste is divided into three sub-projects
dealing with:</P>
<UL>
<LI> AFA-1.1: Waste characterisation </LI>
<LI> AFA-1.2: Performance analysis for the repository  near-field  </LI>
<LI> AFA-1.3: Environmental impact statement (EIS)</LI>
</UL>
<P>These directions of work were found to be of most common Nordic interest for
the period. They have also the advantage that they fit well together in one
project (see Figure 1).</P>
<H3>AFA-1.1 Characterisation of  Long-Lived Low and Intermediate Level
Radioactive Waste</H3>
<P>Waste properties of importance during disposal have been studied. The
following radiological, chemical, physical, mechanical and general properties
may be of importance for determining the management and disposal of long-lived
low and intermediate level radioactive waste [4]:</P>
<UL COMPACT="COMPACT"><LI> Radionuclide content</LI>
<LI> Surface contamination</LI>
<LI> Influence from internal radiation</LI>
<LI> Radionuclides homogeneity</LI>
<LI> Surface dose rate or dose rate at a certain distance</LI>
<LI>Composition</LI>
<LI>Homogeneity and structure</LI>
<LI>Content of free liquid</LI>
<LI>Corrosion resistance</LI>
<LI>Gas evaluation</LI>
<LI>Combustibility</LI>
<LI>Content of chemotoxical substances</LI>
<LI>Chemical reactivity</LI>
<LI>Content of complexing agents</LI>
<LI>Leach properties</LI>
<LI>Internal stability</LI>
<LI>Strength to withstand external influence</LI>
<LI>Shaping, geometry, dimensions</LI>
<LI>Weight and other handling properties</LI>
<LI>Marking</LI></UL>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="figure1.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER><H4>Figure 1</H4></CENTER>
<P>Waste characterisation is a part of a performance analysis, a performance
analysis is a first step in a safety analysis and results from a safety analysis
is used in an environmental impact statement.</P>
<P>For all of the Nordic countries inventories have been made of waste types,
waste containers, conditioning methods, methods to estimate or measure activity
content and methods to estimate or measure chemical composition. The inventories
have mainly been focused on long-lived low and intermediate level waste, but
this differs from country to country depending on different waste situations.</P>
<P>The results from the inventories show that the Nordic countries have much in
common regarding waste characterisation. Steel drums are e. g. common packagings
and segmentation is an often used conditioning method.  But there are also many
differences. Iceland has e. g. at present no special waste containers or
conditioning methods.</P>
<P>The results from the study will be used as background for the future waste
characterisation work during 1996-1997  (3(. Missing methods and methods that
need to be improved will be identified. For these cases available equipment on
the market and relevant information in the literature will be studied. New or
improved methods which provide more information about waste packages will
possibly also be developed.</P>
<H3>AFA-1.2 Performance Analysis for Repository Near-Field</H3>
<P>The sub-project about performance analysis is in progress. The following
components have been identified to be possible parts in a performance analysis:</P>
<UL COMPACT="COMPACT"><LI>Repository concept</LI>
<LI>Waste</LI>
<LI>Barriers</LI>
<LI>Groundwater flow in undisturbed surroundings</LI>
<LI>Groundwater composition</LI>
<LI>Temperature</LI>
<LI>Chemistry of radionuclides and chemical toxic elements (sorption,
solubility, coprecipitation, adsorption, influence of complexing agents,
influence of organic material, colloid generation, colloid transport)</LI>
<LI>Hydraulic and thermal conditions</LI>
<LI>Gas formation</LI>
<LI>Estimates of near-field releases</LI>
<LI>Scenario selection</LI></UL> 
<P>Different methods can be used to systematise and visualise all the features,
events and processes in a performance analysis. Event tree analysis, influence
diagrams and interaction matrix represent such methods. The last method has been
tested for a simplified Nordic repository with one type of waste package. An
interaction-matrix-tool has been developed. The tool is available on diskette as
an Excel file.</P>
<P>The result from the performance analyses project will be presented in an
NKS-report.</P>
<H3>AFA-1.3 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)</H3>
<P>Two theme meetings about Environmental Impact Statements has been held, one
on Iceland 1995 and one in Finland 1996. Both experiences connected to waste
disposal and other areas were covered at the meetings.</P>
<P>One new theme meeting will preliminary be held 12-13 May 1997 at Oskarshamn,
Sweden. The meeting will both include oral presentations and group work. The
oral presentations will mainly treat new experiences. The target for the group
work will be to discuss the EIS-process.</P>
<H2>Conclusions</H2>
<P>Representatives from the Nordic countries Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway
and Sweden are participating in a project about safety in connection with the
disposal of long-lived low and intermediate level waste. The project has three
sub-projects: one about waste characterisation, one about performance analyses
and finally one about environmental impact statement.</P>
<P>Knowledge about waste characterisation is important for safety analyses for
final disposal. The results from the waste characterisation sub-project can
therefore be used in future safety analyses for waste repositories. Also the
report and the interaction-matrix-tool from the performance analysis sub-project
can be used in future safety analyses for waste repositories. The results from
the environmental impact statement sub-project can be used in future
environmental impact statement processes.</P>
<P>Furthermore the results from the studies will contribute to a better
understanding of how the matters are treated in the different Nordic countries
and also to more uniform Nordic attitudes regarding decisions about waste
management and disposal.</P>

Genom att fastst&auml;lla tydliga och m&auml;tbara milj&ouml;m&aring;l
inom koncernen f&ouml;rs&ouml;ker vi inf&ouml;rliva omtanken om
milj&ouml;n i det vardagliga arbetet.<BR>
  Nya d&auml;ck utan farliga oljor, milj&ouml;krav p&aring; lastbilar,
utbildning av alla medarbetare och anv&auml;ndning av
milj&ouml;anpassade produkter &auml;r n&aring;gra exempel.<BR>
  Ett utvecklingsprojekt d&auml;r vi testar etanoldrivna
lastbilar, milj&ouml;anpassade in i minsta detalj, &auml;r ett
annat sp&auml;nnande omr&aring;de som vi v&auml;ntar
oss mycket av.<BR>
  Men viktigast av allt &auml;r kanske &auml;nd&aring; en helhetssyn
p&aring; logistik d&auml;r v&auml;lutvecklade transportsystem
och informationsteknologi &auml;r tv&aring; av de fr&auml;msta verktygen
f&ouml;r att minska belastningen p&aring; milj&ouml;n.<BR>
  Genom effektiva varufl&ouml;den, samordnade i s&aring;v&auml;l nordiska som
europeiska och globala n&auml;tverk, kan vi minska friktionen p&aring; 
allfarv&auml;garna och den omgivande milj&ouml;n.<BR>
Det m&aring;r b&aring;de v&aring;ra kunder och naturen bra av.

Klosterman: Valentine's dating game </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Well, it's almost Valentine's Day. Many of you
are probably planning a special date with that special person
that will make your life complete (and subsequently special).
Meanwhile, the rest of you are still talking about the last
episode of &quot;The X-Files.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">This can be a stressful time for single people.
If you're in a relationship, Valentine's Day is like
sleepwalking: Spend time together, exchange innocuous gifts, say
things like: &quot;This is first time I can remember feeling like
a whole person on Valentine's Day,&quot; etc., etc., etc.
However, it's a weird situation if you're not attached. If you're
a woman and you're completely alone, there's an unwritten rule
that says you must drink margaritas with other lonely women. If
you're a man and you're completely alone, it's usually acceptable
to claim Valentine's Day is an economic conspiracy created by
Hallmark and watch whatever is on TNT.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But if you're casually dating someone,
Valentine's Day is especially dangerous: For many people,
Valentine's Day is the symbolic equivalent of approximately eight
dates. It can create a make-or-break situation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Of course, this isn't all bad. Contrary to
popular belief, men want a serious commitment as much as women
do. The difference is that women view commitment as a status, but
men view it as security. For example, women want men to meet
their parents (this is one of the primary obligations of being
committed). Conversely, men are mainly worried that &#150; if
they don't make a commitment &#150; their partner will say,
&quot;I'm going to visit my parents this weekend&quot; and then
sleep with other men. Thus, men decide it would be a good idea to
become committed as soon as possible. Making parental small talk
is annoying, but it's significantly less embarrassing than being
a victim of infidelity.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Keeping this in mind, I've put together a
scorecard of things you can do to make your Valentine's evening
as special (or as horrific) as the cast of &quot;Beverly Hills:
90210&quot; would like you to believe it should be. Each activity
has a point value; if your personal total adds up to 25, you've
had a successful evening. (Note: Some of you might think you've
seen an article vaguely similar to this in Men's Health magazine.
Well, you haven't). </font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Plenty of doubts in Fargo plan</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By DeAnne Hilgers <br>
The Forum </em></font><font size="4"><br>
On any given afternoon, Mary Pfeffer stops in for a treat at
Cynthia's Custom Cakes in downtown Fargo.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The retired teacher has made her way to the
shop for decades, though it's changed over the years. When it was
Service Drug, she came to pick up the family's medications and
look over the rack of greeting cards. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Now she comes to the renovated shop for the
homemade desserts and a break before volunteering at St. Mary's
Cathedral across the street.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It's not just Service Drug that's changed, she
says. It's the entire downtown. Herbst department store and the
Straus men's store are gone, the greeting card store across the
street from Cynthia's is gone and the train station where she
caught a ride on the Great Northern Empire Builder now serves
microbrews with railroad names.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It isn't as vital as it was several years
back, before they had West Acres,&quot; Pfeffer says. &quot;I
seldom go out there, not as often as I used to come
downtown.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Curt Almlie wants to bring more people like
Pfeffer back to downtown. As coordinator for Fargo's proposed
Business Improvement District, he's spent six months
brainstorming with dozens of other business owners on ways to
revitalize the heart of Fargo. Possible projects include improved
parking, security, landscaping and business recruitment.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The group started as the result of a
recommendation from a mayor's 1995 task force study on downtown
to establish a downtown business improvement district.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The group's efforts, an ordinance creating a
formal Business Improvement District, comes for final reading
before Fargo city commissioners Monday night. The ordinance
allows the district to fund its operation through special
assessments, exempting residential buildings with three or fewer
units.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The ordinance also comes with plenty of doubts.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Gene Shannon has attended improvement district
meetings nearly from the beginning. The more involved the
downtown property owner becomes, the more skeptical he becomes.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He's also interested in vitalizing downtown,
but like dozens of other property owners writing or faxing the
mayor's office with concerns, he wants details. So far, property
owners don't know how much they'll pay or what they'll receive in
return for their cash, Shannon says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He questions whether the district needs money
to make some of the changes needed in downtown. Some solutions
just require changing policy, such as making road construction
projects that improve access to downtown a priority, he says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Shannon first expressed concern about the
district in October when a committee recommended an assessment of
$2.20 for every $1,000 in property value.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Did they really think people weren't
going to be upset about a pretty substantial tax without knowing
what they were going to do with it specifically?&quot; he asks. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Almlie says the $2.20 was only a recommendation
and board members didn't act on it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The &quot;premature assumption ... propagated
by some of our opponents has misled and scared many property
owners unnecessarily,&quot; Almlie wrote to board members last
week.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Shannon says a special assessment's benefit can
be directly attributed to a property, like a new sewer, curb or
sidewalk. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This is supposed to be a special benefit
to the property,&quot; he says. &quot;We just want to know,
what's the benefit?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">That information is coming, Almlie says. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We're to the point where we have the
project nearly finished where we can show the property
owners&quot; the costs and benefits, he said. He has scheduled a
meeting with board members Feb. 26 to review a budget estimated
at $300,000.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Monday's meeting isn't about asking
property owners for money; it's just formally recognizing the
district, Almlie says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The commission's approval Monday is necessary
to keep the project moving after dedicated property owners have
volunteered their time and efforts for six months.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;If we can't be recognized as an
organization, is there any need to go any further?&quot; he asks.
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Property owners still hold the authorization
for the project, Almlie says. Once the budget and benefits are
defined, the information goes to a city assessment committee to
determine costs to each property. Property owners representing 30
percent of the district can reject it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Now we can say to you this is our plan of
action, this is what it will cost you. Now vote. Do you want it
or not?&quot; Almlie says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The method for the district's assessment is
another concern. Current law allows businesses to be assessed by
square footage, but a bill under consideration in the North
Dakota Legislature would allow an alternative method based on a
property's value, including nonprofit properties such as
churches.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">That has pastors and nonprofit administrators
concerned.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;These are not essential services for the
city,&quot; says Scott Hoselton, finance manager for the Catholic
Diocese of Fargo, which owns St. Mary's and the bishop's
residence located in the improvement district. &quot;They're
trying with the wording of the ordinance and legislation to force
the churches to be involved in a business activity.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We're not allowing the government to tell
us how we're going to spend ministry dollars,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Several other church and nonprofit officials
agree. They support downtown and are interested in a voluntary
contribution, but they don't want an automatic assessment.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Almlie expects amendments to the legislation
next week that may suggest exempting churches and nonprofit
organizations.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Success story in progress</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By DeAnne Hilgers <br>
The Forum <br>
GREAT FALLS, Mont.</em></font><font size="4"> &#150; In the
middle of Great Falls' downtown improvement district stands the
Johnson Hotel, a 77-year-old link between the town's past and its
future.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Built in 1920, the hotel's decorative brick
front and marble columns are a reminder of the town's early
prosperity.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Inside, visible only by flashlight, the peeling
woven wallpaper, imitation flagstone flooring and orange shag
carpeting are reflections of attempts a quarter-century ago to
modernize an aging building.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Now water-damaged ceilings, missing wall panels
and pigeon droppings carpeting the floor bespeak demise. But
where visitors see years of settled dust and neglect, Doug
Ormseth sees potential.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The director for the Great Falls Business
Improvement District points to 16-foot marble columns in the
entry, wide open space and a view of the Rocky Mountains from the
top floors that could inspire a developer to consider upscale
condominiums or a bustling health club in the five-story hotel. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">A marketing brochure for the Johnson tells you
that in Montana, a buck will buy you a bottle of aspirin or an
old hotel. If someone buys the Johnson Hotel, the improvement
district will throw in the aspirin as well as asbestos removal, a
new roof and assistance in working with the city and county
governments.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Ormseth also talks about selling an entire
floor or even part of a floor for $10 a square foot, one-tenth
the cost of residential construction in Great Falls.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;You could buy it for $10, put $40 into it
and have something beautiful for half the cost,&quot; he says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He believes it because he's seen it happen.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Out an east window of the Johnson Hotel's
fourth floor, a building across the way was in the same
condition, except for the pigeons, Ormseth says. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Three thousand square feet of concrete has been
covered with ceramic tile, plush carpeting and white textured
walls and ceilings. Tom Workman, chairman of the improvement
district and stockholder in the company that owns the building,
moves into the sun-drenched penthouse this week. He'll watch the
sun set over the mountains from his living room and view the
weathered copper dome of the Cascade County Courthouse from his
master bedroom.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This is what the Johnson could be,&quot;
Ormseth says stretching his arms wide.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Then he could start on the abandoned furrier
store up the street and the old bus depot on the next block. One
building at a time, members from the improvement district hope
cosmetic changes to the buildings will convince developers to not
only restore a building's heart, but the heart of Great Falls'
downtown as well.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;If property starts going down, you've got
an eyesore and people don't want to rent,&quot; Workman says.
&quot;That's what's happened in Great Falls over the last 10
years.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It's going to take many more years to rebuild,
Workman says, and the district had a slow start. The business
improvement district has been around since 1989, started with a
petition in which 85 percent of affected property owners approved
the district.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But the district has been slow in starting,
gaining momentum only in the last year or two.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Board members, city officials and businessmen
point the finger at former director Elinor Luse for the delay. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Toy store owner Bob Rechlin frowns at the
mention of her name, pulling a newspaper clipping from a wall in
the back of the store, a hand-drawn mustache on Luse's picture.
He and other downtown property owners say she didn't step foot in
the very stores she was hired to promote, either to meet them or
to buy their wares.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;They tended to put a lot of faith in her
and she led them down the wrong path,&quot; says Mike Rattray,
the city's assistant director of community development. &quot;The
more perceptive people realized shortly she wasn't what they
needed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But she was under contract, and it was five
years before she left Great Falls.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The secretary and board members took on
director's responsibilities for a couple of years, showing
properties like the Johnson Hotel to potential owners. Board
members like chairman Tom Workman volunteered up to 30 hours a
week, but &quot;You wear real thin in volunteer work when you're
not retired or real wealthy,&quot; he says. &quot;No one wanted
to continue to spend the time necessary.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Just over a month ago, the board hired Great
Falls native Doug Ormseth, raising hopes from Central Avenue to
City Hall.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;They wasted five years,&quot; Rattray
says. &quot;They have some good members, virtually all of them
have good intentions and they're much better equipped
today.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But they still have a long way to go, he says.
They have goals on their list that have been there since the
district started but only recently received any attention. Many
of their projects involve help from the city. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">They also need to be realistic. Attracting
retailers downtown is &quot;like fitting a round peg in a square
hole,&quot; he says. &quot;(Shoppers) want it all on one level,
spread out and they want an ocean of parking out front. You can't
do that downtown.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Specialty shops do very well, he says, but
&quot;they don't take much space so it takes a lot of them to
fill all their vacancies.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Compared to a proposed improvement district for
Fargo, the Great Falls district is small, just seven blocks long
and 3 blocks wide, covering downtown's central thoroughfare,
Central Avenue. Clothing and book stores sit side by side to
specialty shops selling everything from toys and home brew kits
to Christmas ornaments.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Homes or apartments aren't part of the
district. Montana law bars improvement districts from expanding
into residential areas.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I don't know why you'd want to,&quot;
says Ormseth. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Great Falls, with a population of about 60,000,
and Fargo do have several common denominators, most noticeably
shoppers deserting downtown. In Fargo, merchants blame it on West
Acres. In Great Falls, it was the 1980s economy. Nearby Malmstrom
Air Force Base cut staff by 20 percent and the Anaconda copper
mining company closed, leaving 600 people without jobs. Not as
visible but just as costly were downtown businesses, particularly
in finance and insurance, decreasing the number of employees,
Rattray says. &quot;We lost a lot of workers,&quot; Ormseth says.
&quot;Then downtown started to slide and buildings started to go
empty.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Great Falls and Fargo have parking problems,
real or perceived, that need attention. Great Falls kicks off a
&quot;Watch for Spot&quot; campaign March 1. The friendly dog's
mug will help shoppers identify parking places.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The number of parking spots isn't a problem,
Ormseth says. Downtown Great Falls has four for every car in
Cascade County. But there's a perception that parking half a
block from a downtown destination is farther than parking two
blocks from the mall.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Also like Fargo, some downtown private
developers have picked up the ball without assistance from the
business improvement district. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Fargo's long-abandoned Great Northern railroad
depot has become an upscale microbrewery and restaurant. In Great
Falls, the Milwaukee train depot has been remodeled in rosewood
and oak, stained glass and ceramic tile floors to house business
offices. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">As Fargo moves forward in its efforts to create
a business improvement district, Rattray offers this advice: Get
the right person to run it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The candidate must be aggressive but not
offensive, willing to work nights and weekends and understand
everything from public improvements to construction projects to
real estate.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;You'll get a lot of applicants, but you
won't get a lot of good applicants,&quot; he says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Autism's other side</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By Karyn Spencer<br>
The Forum </em></font><font size="4"><br>
Autism launched Temple Grandin's career as a world-renowned
expert on cattle behavior and designer of farm equipment. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">As an autistic person, Grandin can understand
cattle's profound fear of change. Yet the developmental
disability makes her think in pictures, a talent perfectly suited
for design work.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I used to think everyone had a silicon
graphic work station in their head,&quot; she said. &quot;If I
don't have a picture, I don't have a thought.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Grandin gave her perspective as a person with
autism Saturday at the North Dakota Council for Exceptional
Children conference in Fargo. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">She wrote &quot;Emergence: Labelled
Autistic,&quot; the first book from an autistic person's
perspective, and now &quot;Thinking in Pictures And Other Reports
from My Life with Autism.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Autism is a developmental disability marked by
poor communication, unresponsiveness and aversions to social and
physical interaction and change. Dysfunctional behaviors can
include self-stimulation, like rocking and hand-flapping, and
self-injury, like hand-biting.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The most common images are Dustin Hoffman's
toothpick-counting savant in &quot;Rain Man&quot; and shocking
videos of children beating their heads against walls &#150; an
example of the great variation within the disability. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">As for Grandin's image, she stepped onto stage
Saturday as if she'd just stepped off a North Dakota ranch,
wearing a turquoise and black Western shirt, a slim knotted
scarf, jeans and black cowboy boots. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">While some autistic people never speak, Grandin
talks in a fast clip accented with a little twang. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">At age 2, Grandin showed the standard
symptoms of autism, including tantrums and no speech. The disease
often is recognized by the time a child reaches 30 months.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">She credits her parents for forcing her to
interact with others, rather than watching television or whiling
away time with self-stimulating behavior.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Grandin attended a speech therapy nursing
school in the morning, followed by three hours of playing with a
nanny and then another 1 hours practicing manners at the dinner
table.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It's keeping the kid connected with the
world 40 hours a week,&quot; she says. &quot;I wasn't allowed to
sit in the corner and rock.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">While some specific techniques are touted among
teachers, Grandin said her &quot;Miss Manners therapy&quot; and
&quot;nanny therapy&quot; worked well.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I don't care what technique you
use,&quot; she says. &quot;What matters the most is the intensity
of the instruction. Keep the kid tuned in.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Autistic children often are overwhelmed with
sensory overloads, to the point that some cannot hear and see at
the same time. Their unique sensations may cause them to react to
certain clothing, foods or smells.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;These kids with severe problems are like
little jammed radio stations,&quot; she says. &quot;There's
static in their seeing. There's static in their hearing.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Grandin herself can be easily distracted so she
asks audiences to stay seated and turn off beepers and cellular
phones. When one person quietly left Saturday's speech, she
briefly blanked. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I had a little distraction there. I still
have some attention shifting,&quot; she said before launching
back into her talk. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Grandin said the biggest emotion for autistic
people is fear, a characteristic shared with cattle. Both fear
the unexpected, a natural animal instinct. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">She showed a slide of cattle cowering in a
corner because a coat had been placed on a fence. Autistic
children may have the same reaction to a torn couch cushion. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;In nature, some little thing that
shouldn't be there is a danger,&quot; she says. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">She has used the similarities between cattle
and autistic people to benefit both. She has developed more
humane farm equipment for cattle and modified a livestock tool
for autistic people called the &quot;squeeze machine&quot; or
&quot;hug box.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">She first saw the contraption at a relative's
farm. Cattle are placed in a chute that places pressure on them
before branding.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The machine was giving the deep calming
pressure that she and other autistic people crave and sought by
wrapping themselves in blankets or lying between mattresses and
box springs. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">She made her own version with two padded
sideboards in a V-shape. The autistic person lies in the V and
uses a lever to apply the pressure as desired.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Nobody knows why this stuff works, but it
does,&quot; she said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Her design capabilities are enhanced by her
autism, which makes her thoughts appear like Web pages on the
Internet. But those pictures are not linked to emotions or
categorized as a general idea. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;What's a generic dog &#150; a white dog
with a bar code on its butt? I don't have any 'dog' concept in my
mind. I see specific dogs,&quot; she says. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Teachers should be working with children with
autism, dyslexia, attention-deficit disorder and other
&quot;visual thinkers&quot; to focus on their drawing skills. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;There's way too much emphasis on
deficits,&quot; she said. &quot;Let's emphasize on building the
talents.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Junior high students should be linked with
community mentors who have visual jobs like architects, computer
programmers and engineers. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Getting these students interested in a career
is crucial since they may have limited social and emotional
skills, she said. &quot;If I didn't have a career, I wouldn't
have a life.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">And their lives could be quite grand. Famous
intellects like Albert Einstein and Bill Gates have some
characteristics of autism, Grandin said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;If we got rid of all the autism genes,
all we'd have are social yakety-yaks and no computers, rockets
and all that cool stuff,&quot; she said. &quot;We'd still be
living in trees.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Forum editorial: DNR doesn't understand
the bambi syndrome</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Call it the Bambi syndrome. Ever since the
popular Walt Disney movie was released in 1942, there has been an
overly sentimental public perception about deer. Animators gave
&quot;Bambi's&quot; adorable animals the anthropomorphic
characteristics that have become a Disney mainstay. The deer were
personified with sweetness, emotion and personality. Those deer
made Disney a lot of money.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Minnesota hunters are aware of the way people
perceive deer and are wary of anti-hunting groups that rely on
capitalizing on the Bambi syndrome to decry the popular state
sport.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But now in the midst of a harsh Minnesota
winter, the hunters themselves are employing a little Bambi
syndrome to lobby for their own deer concerns.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">No one can deny that deer are being especially
hard hit by the tough weather. Lines of the hungry whitetails are
in farmsteads and backyards searching for food. Often they find
feed on a farmer's lot that is meant for livestock. The deer can
satisfy themselves, but they ruin the forage for the farm animals
with their eating and droppings.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources
is being urged to re-renew a feeding program for deer by hunting
groups that want the herds to survive. The DNR does not want to
spend over $2 million for the controversial feeding program. They
claim there have been no tangible results from previous feeding
programs. Over the last few years agency budgets have forced
various cutbacks in personnel and habitat projects. There is also
a disposition that allows natural selection to determine the fate
of the deer population. They argue that a tough winter thins out
the weaker animals to make way for the strongest of the herd. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Hunters and the non-hunting public disagree.
They point to successful feeding programs that keep the deer
population strong, and sometimes protect farmers' livestock feed
from depredation. Hunters also want to insure the deer herd will
be large enough to sustain the hunting season.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Many legislators apparently agree. A
deer-feeding appropriation is moving through the Legislature,
despite the strong opposition of the DNR.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The savvy use of the Bambi syndrome recognizes
that no one in the general public wants to see deer starve to
death. A deer's suffering seems so much more torturous to us than
the death of fish or rats. Also, like Bambi did for Disney, deer
hunters make money for the state. A lot of money. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Minnesota deer license fees generate more than
$8 million for DNR operations. The sport yields additional
revenue from the accessories associated with hunting: equipment,
transportation and food and lodging. That's a substantial
business for the North Star State. It is also a large part of
Minnesota's hunting legacy. That legacy is less tangible than
dollars in state coffers, but is equally remarkable in scope.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Many landowners and animal lovers appear to be
feeding deer herds during this very severe season without the
DNR's help. The agency has stumbled badly.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The DNR should reconsider its opposition to a
feeding program, not only because the feeding program is good
public relations, but also because of the important revenue deer
hunters generate for the state. Some deer will be rescued. Some
won't. But the expense is in effect an investment that will
generate all sorts of positive returns.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The herds must be maintained, but so must
support for the DNR's many worthwhile programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Riley, Bison solve Mavs</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By Jeff Kolpack <br>
The Forum </em></font><font size="4"><br>
There were a couple of nights in the last several weeks when Fred
Riley was losing sleep. The cure was simple: winning.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Behind 6,123 teammates at the Bison Sports
Arena, North Dakota State knocked off Mankato State 82-67
Saturday night to move to 9-4 in the North Central Conference
men's basketball race. South Dakota State, a Bison opponent next
Friday, leads at 9-3.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It was NDSU's fifth straight win. Moreover, the
Bison welcomed back another weapon this weekend. After a major
slump when the basket looked as big as a golf hole, Riley found
his swing.<br>
&quot;He put two together this weekend, didn't he,&quot; said
Bison coach Tom Billeter. &quot;That's what we were missing,
especially since our numbers are so low.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Riley followed his 18-point, game-winning shot
night Friday with 19 points, five assists and four steals. The
team's emotional leader has more to talk about now.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I just tried not to focus on the bad
things,&quot; Riley said. &quot;You can't dwell on it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Mavericks can dwell on an ineffective
offense against a 2-3 Bison zone. The Bison defenders repeatedly
got their hands on Mankato passes, which resulted in 15 Bison
steals.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It's a defense the Bison don't use often. In
fact, it's been a rare sight in the last three years. Even more
rare still is a win over Mankato for Billeter. He improved his
career record against the Mavs to 2-8.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It's better than 1-9,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Bison strung together 14 straight in the
early in the second half mostly because Mankato couldn't score.
Riley did most of the damage with two free throws, two assists
and a steal. Paul White's free throw at 12:53 gave the Bison a
49-35 advantage.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But the Mavs finally found some offense before
matters got out of hand. Forward Tywan Mitchell burned the Bison
football team from his wide receiver spot last fall. He had six
more points when the Mavs needed to halt the Bison momentum,
which helped them climb within 53-46.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It wasn't stopped for long. This time. Jason
Justus ignited the Bison. The senior had four free throws and a
bucket in a span of a minute and a half to boost the Bison lead
back to 67-48 with 6:26 left.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">After a few stabs early in the half, that 14-2
run was the killer.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We played hard,&quot; Justus said.
&quot;I think we earned this win tonight.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Mavericks were without starting guard
Ausery Washington, who injured a knee in practice last Tuesday.
Redshirt freshman Blaine Joerger, from Staples, Minn., took his
spot. But Joerger and perimeter starters Ryan Benish and Chad
Weeks were a combined 4 of 18 from the field with 11 turnovers.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We had a backcourt change and it was a
good move by them to change defenses,&quot; said Mankato coach
Dan McCarrell said. &quot;It was execution. We weren't
recognizing it and attacking it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">David Kruse led the Mavs with 23 points. He
couldn't do it all, however. He kept the Mavericks from a
halftime deficit by leading his team in points (15), rebounds
(10), steals (2) and assists (3).</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Kruse killed the Bison down the stretch in the
Mavs' 72-65 win at Mankato. The Bison finally solved him.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Touch and pop,&quot; Riley said of the
Bison defense. &quot;You look for the pass first and drive
second. You get a lot of deflections.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">MANKATO STATE (67): Benish 1-6 0-0 2, Joerger
2-8 2-2 7, Witt 0-2 2-2 2, Coleman 0-2 0-0 0, Johnson 3-6 3-3 10,

<p><em>Paul Amundson<br>
IN-FORUM</em></p>

<p><font size="4">I&#146;ve recently been taking a look at many
agriculture sites on the web in preparation for the debut of our
new </font><a href="farm%20forum/index.htm"><font size="4">Farmers&#146;
IN-FORUM</font></a><font size="4"> section. There is a lot of
useful material on the Internet for producers and we were
determined to give farm information the local attention that it
deserves.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The plan that we&#146;ve adopted at IN-FORUM is
to keep the content local. This is a big reason why we don&#146;t
provide many links to other publications or information sources.
We figure that if you&#146;re looking for something else then you
can probably find it easily with a search engine. We&#146;ve
adopted that same strategy with Farmers&#146; IN-FORUM. There are
many other agriculture publications and commercial information
sources available on the web, and they&#146;re easy to find. The
links that we do provide on Farmers&#146; IN-FORUM are links that
will serve as quick reference tools. The market information links
will take you directly to the updated market prices. The
agriculture department and extension service links are great
regional reference sources.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Farmers&#146; IN-FORUM will be updated
regularly with new agriculture stories throughout the week, and
the Farm section of The Forum each Friday. We are also providing
easy links to weather information including the local radar
image, WDAY&#146;s weather page, and national weather service
farm forecast information. (This spring and summer we will also
be able to provide ground temperature information for North
Dakota).</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Since agriculture is responsible for the food
on our tables. We have also decided that this will be a nice
place to collect recipes. Most of them coming from the food
section of The Forum. We&#146;re also interested in collecting
some of your favorite recipes for this section.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">What about the ads? The agriculture section of
the classifieds will be up soon, and we&#146;ll provide an easy
link from the Farmers&#146; IN-FORUM. Eventually, we hope to also
include the auction ads on-line as well.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">We hope to add a column about regional
agriculture in the coming weeks. </font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Frequently asked questions about
IN-FORUM</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>I keep reading old news and see an old date
on the site; how often is IN-FORUM being updated?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4">IN-FORUM is always being updated. All of the
index pages and stories are updated in the early morning hours
before the newspaper is delivered. The weather images are updated
on a constant basis. A common problem that many are experiencing
is that their browser is not reloading the updated pages. Once,
you&#146;ve looked at a page your browser will cache the page on
your machine for easy access later. Sometimes it will not refresh
with the new material when you hit the page again. Check your
browser settings to see if you can change the cache options. If
you suspect you&#146;re not getting a current page or image then
hit reload or refresh.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Why can&#146;t I get the audio to work?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Do you have a sound card and speakers?
They&#146;re necessary for you to hear the real audio clips on
your computer. Do you have the Real Audio Player? It&#146;s
necessary to decode the audio signal. Do you have the Real Audio
Player 3.0? The newest version of the real audio player is
necessary because we are encoding and streaming the audio signal
with the newest and best audio server technology. If you have
more questions about Real Audio you can get answers online here: </font><a
href="http://www.realaudio.com/help"><font size="4">http://www.realaudio.com/help</font></a><font
size="4">. We have also had reports of some audio problems with
America Online users that may be part of the service or browser.
(By the way, you can listen to the audio at either 14.4 or 28.8,
but the sound quality is <strong><u>much </u></strong>better at
28.8.)</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>How can I retrieve a story that I saw
previously on IN-FORUM, The Forum, or WDAY?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Right now you can&#146;t. We&#146;re not set up
to archive the past stories of IN-FORUM. However, in the short
term we have plans to make previous editions of IN-FORUM
searchable. In the long term, we have plans to make archives of
The Forum searchable. We will provide some previous stories in a
directory format for larger issues such as our Capitol Watch and
Rocky React sections.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>When will the classifieds be working and how
will they work?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Right now this is our top priority. We knew
when we launched this site that this would be one of the most
used features, and one of the most difficult to implement. Our
goal is to put all of the daily classifieds from The Forum
online, and make them searchable by category and word. This
database will not be a link to those big national classified
databases, but rather all of the local ads that appear in The
Forum. We are very close to putting the classifieds online. </font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Will you be adding other features like
obituaries, coupons, comics, crosswords, etc?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4">We have big plans for IN-FORUM. Right now
we&#146;re trying to gauge user response and set priorities on
what to add next. We are working under the premise that IN-FORUM
should be local, interactive, and focus on information not found
somewhere else on the web.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Why can&#146;t I find the site with a search
engine, and why do I need the hyphen in IN-FORUM?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4">IN-FORUM has been registered with most of the
search engines along with all of the key words to find the site.
It apparently takes awhile for the information to get into the
databases. When we registered the name IN-FORUM another business
had already registered the name without the hyphen. If you type
in INFORUM you&#146;ll get an Internet service provider in
Indianapolis. We hope with time users will bookmark our site and
make the hyphen just as common as the hyphens in K-Mart and
Wal-Mart.</font></p>

size="4"><br>
</font><font size="5">From WDAY Chief Meteorologist John Wheeler</font></h3>

<p><font size="4">National Weather Service Doppler radar is
perhaps the most sophisticated weather observing tool on this
planet. Every few minutes, an entire suite of products is
generated which gives forecasters information about precipitation
rates, wind velocity, turbulence, and accumulated rainfall. There
are 123 National Weather Service Dopplers at work in the United
States. Nothing can compare to this in any other country.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dopplers save lives and property by allowing
forecasters to see into storms with significantly more detail
than ever before. Many times, warnings for severe weather can be
issued BEFORE the severe weather even occurs. Of course, some
storms still escape detection, but not nearly as many as before.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dopplers use the Doppler effect... the phase
shift caused by a beam of energy bouncing off an object that is
moving toward or away from the Doppler tower. The resulting
Radial Velocity can indicate rotation in storms, a frequent sign
of severe weather or tornadoes. Further detailed analysis of the
storms's structure can indicate whether or not a tornado is
likely developing.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Doppler imagery shown here is known as Base
Reflectivity. This shows the brightness of precipitation echoes.
There are two modes of operation: Precipitation mode and Clear
Air mode,</font></p>

<p><font size="4">During &quot;Precipitation&quot; mode, most of
what you see is precipitation. Some of the lightest echoes are
likely evaporating before reaching the ground. Occasionally,
temperature differences over small distances can bend the radar
beam into the ground, producing false echoes. The presence of
rain and ice together can create unusually high-intensity
reflections called bright banding, which can contaminate parts of
the image. Thin lines usually indicate fronts or thunderstorm
outflow boundaries.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">During &quot;Clear Air&quot; mode, the radar is
still very useful. By making use of more detailed scans, subtle
features of the atmosphere can be seen. Mid-level cloud
formations, which can be a sign of developing precipitation, can
be detected. Light snow, which does not reflect well, can be
seen. During summer, weak air mass boundaries, which often breed
thunderstorms, can be detected.</font></p>

<h3>How to read infrared satellite images<br>
<font size="4">From WDAY Chief Meteorologist John Wheeler</font></h3>

<p><font size="4">These infrared satellite images are made from a
United States weather satellite located 22,000 miles above the
Earth's equator. The satellites are geostationary; that is, they
do not move relative to the Earth. This allows us to detect cloud
changes and cloud movement over time.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">By making use of the infrared spectrum, the
location of clouds can be determined at any time, day or night.
The height of the cloud is determined by its temperature. Warmer
clouds are closer to the ground and colder clouds are higher up.
One drawback of this method is that low clouds are occasionally
indistinguishable from cold ground temperatures under clear
skies. Occasionally, during arctic air outbreaks, the infrared
imagery will indicate clouds when none are present.</font></p>

<h4><font size="4">ALL ABOUT WIND CHILL</font></h4>

<p><font size="4">From WDAY Chief Meteorologist John Wheeler</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;Wind Chill. Everyone talks about it but
nobody ever does anything about it. Most of us use it, but few of
us really understand it as well as we think.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;The Wind Chill Index is an attempt to
quantify the cooling effect of wind. In theory, if the wind chill
is -40, then exposed flesh will freeze as if the temperature is
-40` and there is no wind. Unfortunately, this isn't really the
case. The reality is, the Wind Chill Table is not very accurate.
Here are some Wind Chill facts:</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;Clearly, wind is what makes our cold
weather really miserable. The cooling effect of wind, in addition
to sub-zero temperatures, can make for a very dangerous
combination. Wind greatly increases the dangers of frostbite and
hypothermia to anyone not well-protected.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;Wind Chill was developed by the U.S.
military during World War II. They were looking for a quick and
easy way for military officers to make decisions about outdoor
maneuvers in arctic cold. Unfortunately, their research was
flawed. In their hurried attempt to arrive at a formula, some
data that didn't seem to fit was ignored. The results, therefore,
have errors. A wind chill value of -50 reached by a certain
combination of temperature and wind can feel quite different from
a wind chill of -50 reached by a different combination.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;The Wind Chill Factor became popular
across the United States during the 1960s and 1970s as some
members of the media began using the Index. In response to this
use, the National Weather Service began making the Index
routinely available to the media. Despite it's faults, the Wind
Chill Index has come into the common vernacular. Many people seem
more impressed by the Wind Chill than by the actual temperature.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;Wind cools because of the evaporative
cooling effect of water. For people and animals, the cooling
effect of wind depends entirely on the amount of exposure of
skin. People of different sizes, shapes, and metabolic rates are
affected differently. A well-protected person does not experience
any wind chill factor, no matter what the wind speed.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;Although dogs and cats have insulating
fur, most pets are not equipped for brutally cold conditions.
Frostbite is common, especially on ears, noses, and paws.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;The only effect of wind on cars is to
cool down the engine to the ambient air temperature more quickly
than would be expected without wind. The temperature of a car
engine can never be lower than the actual temperature.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;If the air temperature is 40 degrees and
the Wind Chill Factor is 10 degrees, water will not freeze.</font></p>

width="72" height="108"></font><font size="4"><strong>John
Wheeler: Snow. It defines the landscape. </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Undulating waves of blue-green-tinted whiteness
that affects almost everything we do during winter. It falls from
ash-colored skies as flakes. But snow doesn't soak into the
ground like rain. It just accumulates. We measure it by the inch,
sometimes by the tenth of an inch and occasionally by the foot.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Meteorologically, snow is crystalline
precipitation. No doubt, you have heard that no two snowflakes
are exactly alike. While this is certainly true, the same can be
said for blades of grass or stars or virtually any other group of
like objects in the universe.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Actually, there are about seven different kinds
of snowflakes. Some are shaped like doilies, some like needles,
and some are barely crystalline lumps called graupel. The shape
of the crystal is determined by the temperature at which it is
formed. When snow falls through air that is right at the melting
point, the flakes become wet and many of them may stick together,
creating flakes the size of waffles.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">When snow lies on the ground, the crystals are
further broken by their own weight. This is why our 75 inches of
snow is only 27 inches deep. At the bottom of the snow, heat from
the earth and pressure from above melt and refreeze the snow
crystals into a denser, less-ordered, icy mass.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">When snow falls on a windy day, the crystals
are broken into pieces. In the high wind of a blizzard, snow is
pulverized into tiny bits. This is why average snowfall measured
in the woods of western Minnesota is about 10 inches a year
higher than in the Red River Valley. The water content of the
snow in the two areas is about the same, but Valley snow falls
under windier conditions.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Both wind-packed snow and fluffy snow manage to
retain some crystalline structure, even after settling or
melting. These crystals provide room for air, which means that
snow is a very good insulator. The deeper the snow, the better
the insulation. Under deep snow cover, lake and river ice does
not get as thick, and may even deteriorate over time.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Snow is known to have fallen, at some time or
another, in all 50 of the United States. The snowiest places in
the country are the westward-facing mountainsides of the Cascades
in Washington and Oregon, where a hundred feet of snow may fall
in a single season.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Some lake-effected snow belts in Michigan and
New York can get over 300 inches. In 1977 and again in 1985 snow
flurries fell in Miami Beach. The higher volcanic mountaintops of
Hawaii get enough snow in winter for downhill skiing.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Average seasonal snowfall in Fargo-Moorhead
since 1881 is 40 inches. However, the average for the last 15
years is 50 inches. And the average for the last five years is
more than 70 inches.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">There is no record of snowfall in
Fargo-Moorhead during June, July or August. However, snow
crystals in frozen cirrus clouds can produce sun dogs and moon
dogs at any time of year. The middle and upper parts of
thunderstorms contain many snowflakes that help produce the
static charge responsible for lightning.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Pablermuit group of Inuit people, who
inhabit the western shores of Hudson Bay, have no fewer than 17
different nouns in their vocabulary that translate into English
as &quot;snow.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>North Dakota highway system needs help</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum</em></font><font size="4"><br>
North Dakota has a transportation dilemma: Hundreds of miles of
decrepit roads, too many to maintain, and not enough taxpayers to
pay for the necessary repairs.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">And while traffic increases, federal highway
money is dwindling.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">North Dakota has more miles of road per capita
than any other state, including thousands of miles of cracked and
rutted asphalt.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It's a real pressure cooker,&quot; says
Sen. Larry Robinson, D-Valley City. &quot;We've been known for
years to have one of the best transportation systems in the
country, but that could change.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">State lawmakers and other officials are
contemplating two options that could provide relief from the
financial crunch. A bill is moving through the Senate that would
raise motor vehicle registration fees by $7 in every category;
the money would go into the state transportation fund. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill currently is under consideration by
the Senate Transportation Committee.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A more drastic possibility is one proposed by
Gov. Ed Schafer and the North Dakota Department of
Transportation. Schafer recently directed the NDDOT, along with
county and city governing boards, to undergo a massive rating
system of all roads in the state.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Once all the roads are rated, it may be decided
that some of the less-important ones would be put on a so-called
&quot;secondary maintenance schedule.&quot; In essence, the roads
would stay open but be allowed to go to seed through minimal
maintenance.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;There will only be a certain number of
roads that we can keep up to a certain standard,&quot; says Dave
Rostad, the deputy director of NDDOT. &quot;If some of them have
to fall, they may fall.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Rostad says there is no idea yet of what roads
may be vacated or the number of miles that would be affected. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The NDDOT is responsible for the upkeep of
7,379 miles of road. Many thousands more fall under city, county
and township jurisdiction.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The department considers more than 50 percent
of all state roads to be in fair or poor condition; not even 10
percent are considered excellent.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The average age of a state highway in the
system is 17 years. When most of these roads were built, they
were considered to be on a 20- to 25-year cycle; that has
recently been extended by NDDOT to a 35- to 40-year cycle.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We should be doing about 400 miles a year
of road restructuring, but for the last few years we have only
been at 270 miles a year,&quot; Rostad says. &quot;Obviously,
with every passing year we fall a few hundred more miles
behind.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The age of the system is not the only problem.
Traffic has greatly increased in just the last two years, mostly
due to the NAFTA trade pact, which has resulted in a 30 percent
increase in I-29 truck traffic.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Transportation officials cringe at the thought
of spring, when they will have to survey all the damage sure to
be caused by this winter's severity.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It's not going to be pretty,&quot; Rostad
says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the face of all these problems, the state is
looking at further decreases in federal subsidies, which have
already fallen in recent years. In its 1997-1999 budget request,
NDDOT eliminated 30 full-time positions as just one cost-saving
effort.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">For years, the state has relied on a generous
federal subsidy to cover the high costs of maintaining the
transportation system. In 1996 North Dakota received a $95
million federal appropriation for transportation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The federal dollars are just a part of the
total spending pie for state transportation, which from July 1995
to June 1996 amounted to $235 million.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The federal government bankrolls its state
subsidies in large part with revenue from the federal gas tax,
currently 18 cents a gallon. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The problem now facing North Dakota, though, is
that the state falls under the category of &quot;recipient&quot;
state; that is, the dollar amount we receive in subsidies amounts
to more than we contribute to gas tax collections.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;North Dakota receives about two dollars
for every dollar we pay in,&quot; says Dennis Jacobson, the
legislative liaison at NDDOT.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A movement is under way in Congress among the
&quot;donor&quot; states &#150; states such as Wisconsin, Texas
and Indiana that pay in more then they get back &#150; to reverse
this trend, which they see as inequitable.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;They're basically saying, this has got to
change,&quot; Robinson says. Congressmen from several recipient
states, including North Dakota, have introduced
counter-legislation that would keep federal dollars flowing to
all states.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., has a measure that
would distribute $260 million in federal highway funds to six
large rural states with small populations, including North
Dakota.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">While Congress tries to work out the federal
role, the state Legislature continues to look for ways to tap
into state resources to pay for road projects. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The House Finance and Taxation Committee has
sponsored a bill that would keep in place a 3-percent tax hike
for a gallon of gas, which brings the state gas tax to 20 cents a
gallon. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The tax was passed in the 1995 session with the
understanding that it was a two-year temporary measure. The
current bill would extend it another two years. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Schafer and NDDOT officials would like to make
the tax permanent, but House and Senate Republican leaders John
Dorso and Gary Nelson have said they fear that would be a tough
political sell, and favor the two-year extension.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Friday the Senate passed a resolution calling
for a Legislative Council study on the adequacy of transportation
funding in the state.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We just want to know where the money's
coming from and how it's being spent,&quot; says Senate
Transportation Chairman Bob Stenehjem, R-Bismarck. The study
could lead to legislation in the 1999 session that would
restructure the entire financing system.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Something's got to change,&quot; Valley
City's Robinson says. &quot;This is not a partisan issue. This is
something that affects every corner of our state.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Cities around the region tackle
problems downtown</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By DeAnne Hilgers <br>
The Forum <br>
</em></font><font size="4">Winter winds once whipped off of icy
Lake Superior to deliver a burning slap to the faces of Duluth,
Minn., residents.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The wind hasn't mellowed, but shoppers and
walkers no longer suffer its sting.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They stroll well-protected through the city's
two miles of skywalks, part of Duluth's downtown improvement
project that began 20 years ago. It was the city fathers' call to
prodigal sons and daughters to come home.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Living in northern Minnesota can be a
harsh winter. You can go from city hall to almost the entire
downtown area without going outside,&quot; says Karl
Nollenberger, chief administrative officer for the city and
executive director of the Economic Development Authority.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Like many towns with a once-bustling city
center, Duluth's downtown retail stores were nearly abandoned
with the advent of malls and their asphalt fields of parking
places miles from downtown.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The answer to revitalizing downtowns is unique
to each city, whether it's a tax increment financing district or
a business improvement district like that proposed for Fargo.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Duluth made a conscious effort to limit zoning
for offices to downtown, maintaining a hold as the office,
banking and finance center and keeping what retail might go with
it. It also started a downtown tax increment financing district
in 1977.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Tax increment financing temporarily
&quot;freezes&quot; the value of a property within a designated
district and the amount of taxes provided to the city, county and
schools. As the property value increases, the resulting increased
taxes pay for improvements and business recruitment to the
district.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Duluth's downtown district raises approximately
$2.7 million a year for skywalks, a tunnel and special projects
such as expanding Waterfront Park into downtown. If the city
built those skywalks now, Nollenberger estimates it would cost
$50 to 60 million.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Funds also paid to prepare lots where
developers built three hotels and a parking lot for a large
office complex.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Along the waterfront, immediately adjacent to
downtown, a 10-year-old tax increment financing district that
raises about $1.1 million a year has paid for a lake walk, brick
streets, landscaping and public art.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The city of Rochester, Minn., also used tax
increment financing to fund private development and improve
downtown with brick sidewalks, landscaping and decorative
lighting. Since the program started in 1979, funds have helped
developers add two hotels, office buildings, low-income housing
for senior citizens and a shopping center with a multiplex
theater. A non-profit agency benefited from some of the funds to
develop housing for handicapped people and the city benefited
from new skyways, surface parking lots and ramp parking connected
to the skyway system.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The nearby Mayo Clinic hasn't participated
directly in the project, but the employees and patients it
attracts is &quot;the economic engine that plays an important
part that makes it all work,&quot; says Doug Knott, the city's
development administrator.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">On weeknights and weekends, cars are scattered
across parking lots that once were deserted after the regular
workday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It was a downtown that was in the
beginning of decline&quot; in 1979, Knott says. &quot;There were
no new buildings going up and nobody was investing in the
existing buildings. What you see now is a downtown that's a
pretty vibrant place.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sioux Falls, S.D., uses a business improvement
district for downtown development.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Started in 1989, the three-year special
assessment property tax raises about $75,000 a year and has been
renewed twice.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Funds from the improvement district, combined
with private donations and a share of the city's budget, pay for
30 to 50 special events downtown, promotional events and stipends
for architects who provide design renderings for business owners
planning to remodel.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Assessments are based on $1 for every $1,000 of
the property's land value and $1.50 for every $1,000 of its
buildings value, capped at $200 for land value and $1,500 for a
building. Industrial-zoned properties, single-family residences
and duplexes are exempt. Apartment building owners are assessed
at 50 percent.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">City Planner Steve Metli says the business
improvement district started with a specific three-year budget
and a general plan for improvements before seeking the city's
approval. Sixty percent of property owners signed on and by the
time the plan came up for renewal a second time in 1995, 90
percent signed on, says Carol Pagones, executive director of Main
Street Sioux Falls, the city's economic development organization.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They had their detractors initially, Pagones
says. Business owners didn't want to pay the assessments,
believing that a dying downtown wouldn't affect their business.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;That vision is looking right into a blank
wall,&quot; Pagones says. &quot;There is no vision there.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Having some sort of focal point organization
that brings everyone together makes it a unified neighborhood,
Metli says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The city pays for landscaping and snow removal,
and a parking authority board raises its own funds through leases
and other paid parking for improvements.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We've seen many communities that die at
the heart,&quot; Metli says. &quot;Our downtown is healthy and
prosperous and growing well.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By Jeff Kolpack <br>
The Forum </em></font><font size="4"><br>
North Dakota State had to search for motivation in a pile of
Mankato State losses Saturday night. Not quite like finding a
needle in a haystack, but close. It took 9 minutes, 35 seconds
for NDSU to discover it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">That's when the Bison took a 20-second time out
to regroup. Ahead by one point, they found their form and cruised
to a 97-59 North Central Conference women's basketball victory
before 6,120 at the Bison Sports Arena. NDSU improved to 22-0
overall and 13-0 in the league.<br>
The Mavericks fell to 5-17, 1-12. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">But, all things considered, it was a good
showing by the less-talented Mavericks. Leading scorer Tracy
Harter, a 5-foot-10 senior forward, was sidelined after getting
injured Friday at the University of North Dakota. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">With a lineup composed primarily of freshmen
and sophomores, their 17-point halftime deficit was almost a
moral victory. Evidence of that was a show of celebration by Amy
Hintgen after her 3-point field goal at the buzzer. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">At that point, the Mavs were shooting 52
percent. Problem was, the Bison were at 58 percent behind Theresa
Lang's 6 of 7 and Andrea Kelly's 5 of 6. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">It never stopped. The Bison finished 6 of 6
from 3-point range &#150; a school record &#150; and were a
machine-like 62 percent on 34-of-55 shooting. The number that
counted, however, was Mankato's 59 points. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Our goal was better rebounding and
defense,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;We wanted to hold them to 50
points. Our team defense was definitely better than last night.
We gave away a lot.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Bison gave up a season-high 78 points in a
108-78 victory against St. Cloud State Friday night. With a big
lead, the Bison wanted to avoid the temptation of all offense and
little defense.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;In these situations, everybody thinks
about scoring,&quot; said Bison coach Amy Ruley. &quot;We like to
see our people work hardest on defense and rebounding. In these
games, the tendency is to think offense.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Bison had a lot of positive thoughts. Lang
had 20 points, Kelly 18, Kasey Morlock 15 and Rhonda Birch 14.
The Bison starters shot 67 percent.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The 97 points stopped NDSU's streak of two
straight games over 100 points. That was mostly due to Mankato's
offense and NDSU's defense, which combined to milk the 30-second
shot clock to under 10 seconds many times.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It was NDSU's 39th straight win and 55th
consecutive at home. It was also the end of the cupcake season.
NDSU's last five games are against the five NCC teams chasing
them. Moreover, all five are in the regional playoff hunt.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">From a motivational standpoint, that is welcome
news for the Bison. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We have a nice little cushion but we
don't want to give it up,&quot; Ruley said of the two-game
conference lead. &quot;All of those teams can play with us.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Goehring turns away Lincoln</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By Dave Kolpack <br>
The Forum </em></font><font size="4"><br>
The week before the trading deadline in the United States Hockey
League was a little like the Karl Goehring sweepstakes. Coaches
were stacked up on phone lines with tenders for the F-M Ice
Sharks goaltender.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Goehring was too good to lose to any offer
they couldn't refuse. The Apple Valley, Minn., product proved
that again on Saturday night when he spoiled the homecoming for
former F-M Bears coach Steve Johnson.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Goehring hung a zero on Johnson and the Lincoln
Stars, turning back 36 shots in leading the Sharks to 3-0 win
before 2,568 fans at the Coliseum, the largest crowd since
opening night.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I guess you could say Karl stood on his
lips,&quot; said Sharks center Mike Gast. &quot;I guess we're all
kind of getting used to it from him, but he played as well as a
goaltender can play, especially in the first period.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Goehring used every part of his body and every
piece of his equipment in making 18 saves in the opening period.
There was one play when he appeared to be handcuffed on a
screened shot by Nick Fohr, only to lift his right shoulder blade
at the last instant to tip the puck over the net.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;He made saves he had no business
making,&quot; said Sharks co-coach Tarek Howard. &quot;It has
been Lincoln's trademark to jump all over you from beginning to
end and we came out sleeping, except for Karl.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Sharks refused to snooze in the second
period, the only frame in which they managed to outshoot the
Stars. And they got their special teams in order. After lumbering
through a 45-second two-man advantage without a threat in the
first period, the Sharks got on the board with a power-play goal
by Benji Wolke with 1:17 remaining in the second period.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;There was a lot of pressure building for
that first goal,&quot; said Wolke, who played with the Twin
Cities Vulcans last year. &quot;It was a tight-checking game
between two defensive teams with similar styles. They reminded me
a lot of last year's Bears.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wolke scored after he sneaked in from the left
boards and stationed himself at the post. That's when Jared
Gustafson, waiting at the left point, one-timed Jeff Panzer's
pass and Wolke tipped it into the top shelf. It was a sequence
that impressed the former Bears coach.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Gustafson made a great play on that
one,&quot; Johnson said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I saw him out of the corner of my eye as
I wound up,&quot; Gustafson said. &quot;The first goal is always
huge, but especially tonight after the little guy between the
pipes kept us in the game.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Sharks gained some breathing room at 14:55
of the third period when the line of Jerry Gernander, Chris
Sikich and Wolke cashed in on some persistent forechecking. Wolke
and Sikich wound up keeping the puck alive behind the net before
Gernander converted from the slot to make it 2-0.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sikich put the game away a minute later when he
scored on a breakaway while the Sharks were not only skating
shorthanded, they were operating with special teams wizard Jeff
Panzer in the penalty box with a 10-minute misconduct.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I think that shows you something about
our depth,&quot; Sikich said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The win upped F-M's record to 21-19-1 for 43
points, giving the Sharks a seven-point edge over Thunder Bay in
the battle for the eighth and final playoff spot. The Stars fell
to 29-10-1 and dropped four points behind Des Moines for the top
spot in the USHL.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We're going through a little bit of tough
stretch here where we haven't had that 'hate to lose'
attitude,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;Maybe this will humble us a
little bit, but I was also impressed with smart game the Ice
Sharks played.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The nine former Bears on the F-M club seemed
like they were happy just making an impression on their former
coach.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;You've got a lot of guys in here who
learned the game of hockey from Steve Johnson,&quot; Gast said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">FIRST PERIOD: No scoring. Penalties-minutes:
F-M 3-6, Lincoln 3-14.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">SECOND PERIOD: 1, F-M, Wolke (Gustafson,
Panzer), 18:43 (pp). Penalties-minutes: F-M 1-2, Lincoln 2-4.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">THIRD PERIOD: 2, F-M, Jerry Gernander (Wolke,
Sikich), 14:55. 3, F-M, Sikich (Gustafson, Jerry Gernander),
15:55 (sh). Penalties-minutes: F-M 3-14, Lincoln 2-4.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">GOALIE SAVES: Lincoln, Braun 6-7-5&#150;18.
F-M, Goehring 18-4-14&#150;36. A&#150;2,568.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Clutch performer</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By Eric Peterson<br>
The Forum</em></font><font size="4"><br>
Grand Forks Central is the defending North Dakota Class A high
school boys basketball state champion. The Knights showed why
Saturday against West Fargo.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Central, which suffered a tough overtime loss
to Fargo Shanley at home Friday, gutted out a 47-46 victory at
the Packers' gym in Eastern Dakota Conference action.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Mark Hoverson hit a free throw with 17.8
seconds to play for the winning margin.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This is one of the toughest places to win
in the state. It was a good mental test for us,&quot; said
Hoverson, who led the Knights with 15 points and 12 rebounds.
&quot;This was a season-type game for us. It's the kind of game
that could turn around the season.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the fourth quarter, Hoverson hit the front
end of a bonus situation before missing the second, missed the
front end of another bonus, and missed the first of two before
hitting the game-winning free throw. So Hoverson had three
consecutive misses looking him in the eye before he drilled the
deciding free throw.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But neither Hoverson nor his coach Todd Olson
had any question the 6-foot-2 senior would come through.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I made the one that mattered,&quot;
Hoverson said with a smile.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I knew he would make it,&quot; Olson
said. &quot;He made two free throws in a similar situation in the
semifinals of state tournament last year.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">West Fargo had one more chance to win the game
after Hoverson's free throw.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Packers got the ball into the hands of
Scott Majkrzak, who ran down the game clock before driving to the
hoop. At the free throw line, howewever, Majkrzak dished the ball
to Keif Wagner on the right wing.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wagner, who had hit a 3-pointer a minute
earlier to cut the Central lead to 46-44, faked a shot and
dribbled inside the 3-point arc before pulling back behind the
line again and shooting. The 6-foot-1 junior's shot rimmed out
into the hands of Hoverson, who quickly outleted the ball before
the Packers could foul and time ran out.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We had a good look at it,&quot; said West
Fargo head coach Doyle Plecity. &quot;He had hit a big three
before that.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Central took control of the game late in the
third quarter and early in the fourth behind the play of
sophomore Jacob Bohm. The 6-foot-5 center scored eight points of
a Knights' 10-2 run which started with 2:05 left in the third
quarter and ended with 6:32 left in the game.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Bohm capped the run with a pair of free throws
that put Central up 39-33. He started the run with a soft jump
hook in the middle of the lane.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;(Bohm) was real big,&quot; Olson said.
&quot;He made some big shots, posted up strong and got some big
rebounds for us. He really stepped up his play tonight.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Plecity agreed with Olson.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;(Bohm) really hurt us,&quot; he said.
&quot;He created a mismatch for us inside.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Grand Forks Central improved to to 10-4 overall
and 10-4 in EDC points with the 2-point victory. West Fargo fell
to 8-6 and 7-6.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Defensively we played them as well as
anybody has,&quot; Plecity said. &quot;But we beat ourselves. We
gave them too many offensive rebounds and we turned the ball over
too many times.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Packers turned the ball over 15 times,
while Central outrebounded West Fargo 38-21. </font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Forum editorial: Students should be in
school </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Panic has set in for some Detroit Lakes, Minn.,
students at their senior high school. They are facing a most
serious threat to their educational experience. That threat, not
for the fainthearted teen, is that they may actually be required
to spend their entire school day.......in school. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">School officials have responded to an alarming
truancy rate by proposing a closed campus for next year's
freshmen and sophomores. The school estimates that 150-200
students are absent from school daily. Many of those absentees
are kids who have simply walked off the school grounds during the
day.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Older folks around here may remember the Our
Gang comedies where little Jackie Cooper and the rest of the
rascals played hooky. They were usually rounded up by a truant
officer, who would capture the boys after a series of comic chase
scenes.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But those black and white comedies don't hold a
candle to the black and white reality of trouble with truancy in
Detroit Lakes.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">To counter the school's threat to keep kids on
campus, a 20-member Student Advisory Committee has compiled a
list of get tough proposals to present to the School Board
tonight. The students want a stricter policy to deal with class
cutting and school skipping. They claim that the administration
is lax with policy and short on consequences for truant behavior.
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Those not involved in a day-to-day school
operation have a difficult time understanding open campus
policies. Class scheduling, student job conflicts and other
considerations have changed the face of the time-honored
traditional school day. Evidently it was those bygone &quot;good
old days&quot; that required students to go to school and stay
there. The days of Our Gang comedies. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">But the absentee rate in DL is no laughing
matter. The kids want tougher standards from their school.
Everyone here appears to share some of the blame. But they are
also part of the solution. Students should take their own
initiative to be in school. The school should have clear policies
that punish violators. Parents should help focus their truant
offspring to understand their own responsibilities.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A closed campus might be too extreme a
reaction. Detroit Lakes school officials would be well served by
talking with administrators and students at the West Fargo High
School in North Dakota. There a tough, clear attendance policy
that includes daily followup with families of absent kids, is
working well.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">One Detroit Lakes student involved in the
proposal says &quot;there would be chaos in the school if the
campus closed.&quot; Sorry son. It sounds as if there's chaos
now. The hard part will be developing a solution that does not
substitute one form of chaos for another.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>David R. Givers, Other Views: It is not
smart to fight nature at Devils Lake </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">The headline in the Other View commentary of
the Sunday Forum (Feb. 2) is &quot;Devil's Lake outlet will harm
Sheyenne's River.&quot; That seems like a sure bet given the
increased flows that would result from the proposed outlet.
Stream ecologists know and can statistically demonstrate that
channel velocities are a key factor to the type and variety of
organisms that inhabit any given stream.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">For those who don't give a hoot about a long
nosed dace, they should consider the expected increase in
salinity and what that means to drinking water quality. We really
don't have any good estimates, to the best of my knowledge, on
those costs. Yet many people are willing to go ahead with this
project based on a whistle and a slap on the back.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Hugh Thorfinnson, in his column, had some
interesting benefit-cost statements including that outlet
benefits of 39 cents accrue for every dollar spent. Read that
again.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I remember when the water bugs were proposing
the Kindred Dam 20 or so years ago. It turned out that costs
exceeded benefits there too. The local citizens got involved and
made this point loud and clear because the Army Corps of
Engineers couldn't seem to find any problem with the proposal.
The Sheyenne Valley Association proposed a diversion around
Fargo/West Fargo.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The irony is that the diversion proposal was
much cheaper than a dam and, if it had been built when proposed,
matching federal dollars would have reduced local cost sharing
considerably. The diversion was eventually constructed at a
higher cost and cost-sharing ratio. Now, West Fargo residents
feel the cost of the diversion on their property taxes. If they
had listened to the environmentalists and the Sheyenne Valley
farmers and ranchers, they would have gotten a better
deal-sooner.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The interesting cost that Thorfinnson cites is
the annual operating cost of $700,000. That cost is forever. Ask
yourself this. If we were to borrow the money and move people out
of the flood plain and flood proof what we can't move (build the
roads higher), how would that compare to an outlet? No one has
done that to the best of my knowledge. Why not?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I believe the reason officials have not done an
abandoning of the flood plain study is due to our arrogance
towards nature. Recently, a front page headline in The Forum said
$100 million spent fighting the flood. Fighting is in our
cultural genes. Reminds me of the cautionary fairy tale about the
king ordering the ocean tides to cease. You think we would
eventually learn from sitting on our mother's knees and hearing
these stories that Mother Nature is stronger than human will.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But of course, the builders and movers warn
that Devils (Spirit) Lake could spill out and then we would
really have big time problems, &quot;Let's solve those problems
before they get out of control.&quot; What we are being asked to
accept is a solution that addresses the 10,000 year flood
frequency. My fellow Americans, if Devils Lake is topping 1,854
feet there are going to be one heck of a lot of other swamps to
clear. In that event, we would be up to our armpits in other
kinds of alligators. This kind of talk from the water kings of
North Dakota is nothing more than a form of scare mongering.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The physical solution to Devils Lake water
problems lies in Devils Lake Basin. Working with the adapting to
ecosystems is smarter than fighting Mother Nature.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Letter: Impression would be different
if she was there </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">In response to Miriam Geiger's (letter, Jan.
29) concerns that the Fargo-Moorhead Junior League is hosting a
series of programs for adolescent girls that are intended to
assist in boosting the self-confidence and self-esteem of the
participants:</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In striving to achieve this, the league is
highlighting some life areas where many pubescent girls have
concerns, awkward moments, self-doubts and perhaps, unanswered
questions. Specifically, the first program series dealt with body
changes and health concerns for the maturing young woman. Issues
addressed included proper exercise and diet, body changes
associated with puberty, and self-discovery of the emerging woman
inside each of these girls.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">As I spoke at this first program on Jan. 11, I
can state with first-hand knowledge that all of the program
speakers stressed the importance of discovering one's own talents
and optimizing the gifts that each unique individual has to
offer.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The second program to be scheduled in February
will focus on the area of young women discovering their own
beauty, within themselves first, and then learning to project
this beauty outwardly as they see fit.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Finally, the third program will be devoted to
informing these young women of volunteering opportunities and
community service opportunities that are available for them to
become involved with. This would allow them to share with the
community the inner beauty, talents and discoveries that they
have gleaned about themselves.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I am disappointed that Geiger chose to
criticize a program for which she had become aware of, but never
personally attended. If she had attended the January program, I
think her impressions would be much different. </font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Letter: CPR project off to good start,
but has just begun </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">A well-matched partnership between the American
Red Cross, Fargo Fire Department, West Fargo Fire Department,
Heart Attack REACT and Dakota Medical Foundation has launched the
'Til Help Arrives community CPR project.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Fast, free and easy &#150; On Jan. 18 at the
Civic Center's Centennial Hall, 473 people braved cold
temperatures and light snowfall to learn CPR. The success of the
rally was only possible due to the commitment of about 40
firefighters from Fargo-West Fargo, who volunteered their time to
instruct; as well as to Dakota Medical Foundation, who funded the
project to eliminate the cost of the training for all
participants. Our special thanks go to each of them.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Our appreciation also goes to the young people
from the Moorhead Senior High School Key Club who helped direct
the crowd to their instructor teams, and to the other Red Cross
certified instructors who volunteered their time.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But the project is far from over; in fact, it
has just begun. CPR training is being made conveniently available
at each of the neighborhood fire stations in Fargo and West Fargo
every month. We hope the people of this community will call the
fire departments today, and register to attend one of the
upcoming one-hour training sessions. Families and neighborhood
groups are encouraged to attend and learn together. There is no
testing; and, like the rally on Jan. 18, it's fast, free and
easy.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Why are the partners doing this? With 77
percent of heart attacks occurring in the home, and with the
first two minutes critical to the survival rate of the victim,
learning CPR is a good thing to do for those you love and care
about &#150; and for this community. </font></p>

than Cablecom's poor service </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Once again Cablecom of Fargo has informed us of
yet another rate increase. At this current rate of increases,
dual income families will be a necessity just to afford cable
viewing.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">On the brighter side, Cablecom has added more
networks to their service. More networks that I personally didn't
ask for, nor do I utilize, but none the less, still have to pay
for.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In their &quot;Rate Increase Mailing&quot; they
boast about their &quot;exciting multi-million dollar
construction project for more programming choices, better
reliability and sharper picture,&quot; yet the past three months
my bill has remarkably been reliable to show up on time, with no
cable guide in it. The guide usually shows up three or four days
late. I guess that's how they justify raising their rates again.
Perhaps the next rate increase will be for receiving programming
guides on time. I would think that after spending more than a
million dollars on improvements, something as simple as mailing
via the U.S. Post Office shouldn't be such a challenging task.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I suppose you can get by with just about
anything when you can monopolize an industry. And believe me, I
have investigated other avenues of service. I would just like to
know when its going to end. I suppose there's always the radio. </font></p>

any day now.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Where does the time go?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The lights on Eighth</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Happily, time almost stands still on Fargo's
8th Street South, thanks to its streetlights from another era.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">This comes to mind because of a letter
Elizabeth Lorshbough, Fargo, gave to the Fargo Heritage Society,
which published it in its newsletter.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The letter was written by Elizabeth's mother,
Mabel Lorshbough, to her husband Walter, an officer in the Navy
serving overseas.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The mailing date of the letter: Nov. 12, 1916.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The letter included this bit of news:</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Last night the great white way on Eight
St. was lighted for the first time. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It certainly is pretty and what an
improvement. Eighth was always the darkest St. in town, you know.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;As bumpy as it is over there, we drove up
and down four times just to see the lights. They extend as far as
11th Ave. South.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">So there's an illuminating look at Fargo's
past. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">One more thing, while we're on Mabel's letter.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">As an indication it was written in a time when
life wasn't quite so complicated, here's how it was addressed:</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lt. W.W. Lorshbough U.S.N.<br>
U.S.S. Des Moines<br>
c/o Postmaster, New York City</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Apparently Lt. Lorshbough received it, even
without a Zip Code.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Presidential personalities</font></p>

<p><font size="4">With Lincoln's and Washington's birthdays upon
us, let's talk presidents.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">H.R. Brown, Yuma, Ariz., sends in a clipping
about what characteristics make a good president, and the
presidents who historians and biographers rate the highest in
each cagegory:</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Intelligence &#150; Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt,
Wilson.<br>
Extroversion &#150; Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt, Clinton.<br>
Openness to experiences &#150; Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt, John
Quincy Adams.<br>
Agreeableness &#150; Hayes, Madison, Lincoln.<br>
Conscientiousness &#150; Washington, Wilson, Madison.<br>
Character &#150; Hayes, Washington, Madison.<br>
Neuroticism &#150; Nixon, Andrew Johnson.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Still another study, the article says, rates
these presidents tops in these areas:</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Good ol' boys (assertive, creative, need
achievement and excitement, but low on character, integrity,
self-discipline) &#150; Jackson, Lyndon Johnson, Clinton.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Extroverts (high on trust, with a need for
affiliation and charisma) &#150;Truman, Kennedy, Eisenhower,
Ford, Carter, Reagan.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Passive (agreeable, modest, compliant) &#150;
Grant, Taft, McKinley.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dour scholars (stern, puritanical, harsh)
&#150; John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Coolidge, Hoover, Nixon.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Given all this, which of these guys would you
want for a neighbor?</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Growing up in the Midwest</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By Tom Pantera<br>
The Forum </em></font><font size="4"><br>
If you considered moving out of North Dakota or Minnesota after
the last blizzard, it may not be entirely because of the weather.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Moving, Carolyn Lieberg says, is a Midwestern
habit.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lieberg, a former magazine editor and now
associate director for teaching at the University of Iowa in
Sioux City, has chronicled moving, and other habits, foibles and
oddities of Midwesterners in a new book, &quot;Calling the
Midwest Home: A Lively Look at the Origins, Attitudes, Quirks and
Curiosities of America's Heartlanders&quot; (Wildcat Canyon
Press, 1996, $12.95).</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The book is a collection of facts, from the
mundane to the weird, about people and places in the vast land
people living on the coasts often call &quot;flyover
country&quot;: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan,
Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota
and Wisconsin.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It mentions such Midwestern facts as: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="4">a third of all Americans live within 500
        miles of Wisconsin; </font></li>
    <li><font size="4">Des Moines, Iowa, is home of an annual
        celebration of leisure suits; </font></li>
    <li><font size="4">the origin of the pot-luck dinner;</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">and the number of golf courses in
        Fargo-Moorhead (10).</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="4">Sprinkled in-between are more mundane lists,
like the names of Nobel Prize winners from the Midwest, and
reminiscences by common folks of growing up in the heartland. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The book is written in a chatty, witty style
that recalls the woman who's the character at every church
picnic.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lieberg, 49, is a Watertown, S.D., native who
has lived in or visited most of the Midwestern states and also
has lived on both coasts. The idea for the book came from Julie
Bennett, the Wisconsin-born publisher at Wildcat Canyon Press in
Berkeley, Calif.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At the time, Lieberg was living in Princeton,
N.J., and had gone to Chicago for a meeting of the American
Booksellers Association.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">She was browsing the stalls at the convention
and struck up a conversation with Bennett at the Wildcat Canyon
Press booth.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;She called about seven or eight weeks
later and said 'I'd really like to publish a book about the
Midwest. Are you interested in writing about it?'&quot; Lieberg
recalls. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;So much of my life and my career
interests have been focused on the Midwest, it was a pleasure to
use (that).&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Many of the facts she eventually included in
the book Lieberg discovered when she edited a children's history
magazine in Iowa. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;There were a lot of things there that
just kind of got stored,&quot; she says. She also drew on years
of graduate-school research. &quot;And my husband's a librarian.
That was a big help, too.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Bennett pitched the book to Lieberg in August
of 1995 and Lieberg finished writing in July 1996. In addition to
what she already knew, Lieberg spent three or four months in
concentrated research</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Some of the work she hired done; other facts
she gleaned from sources all over the United States.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;For instance, I think that more people in
Topeka, Kansas, split their Oreo cookies before they eat
them,&quot; she says. &quot;That was some odd thing from the New
York Times Magazine about food in parts of the country.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Often, she would be in the midst of heavy
research, &quot;then I'd hear something on the radio that would
be a surprise.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Much of the hardest work came in deciding what
to keep in the book.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I just tried to focus on the things that
seemed like they'd be good little nuggets,&quot; Lieberg says.
&quot;I'm grateful to the people who spent years and years doing
books on things like weird laws.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">After it was finally written, Lieberg wound up
cutting about 70 pages of material. &quot;There were sections on
service to the country that were pretty interesting,&quot; she
says. She also regretted having to cut portions dealing with
religion. &quot;That was hard to see that go, because I thought
it was important.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But the facts she thought vital, still found a
place in the book. &quot;I think the ones that really killed me,
I got in,&quot; she says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">For example, a short piece by Wilton Blake
Webster of Churchs Ferry, N.D., about seeing Franklin Roosevelt
come through Devils Lake, N.D., was slated for cutting, but
Lieberg liked it so much it was kept in the book.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Among her favorite entries are those about the
earliest years of Midwest settlement. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I'm fond of some of the really old stuff,
like the fact that oxen would walk for 2,000 miles in the
summertime if you took care of them,&quot; she says. &quot;That
was a real treasure to come upon.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The character-at-the-church-picnic writing
style came out of Lieberg's own personality.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It wasn't conscious initially, because I
thought at first that the publisher wanted a pretty
straightforward book,&quot; she says. &quot;I would put what I
would call my little wisecracks in a few things and she (Bennett)
loved them. Initially, they were sort of an accident. I think
actually, she would've liked more of them.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I think it's quite reflective, actually.
I'm not very cynical, but I make wisecracks. I'm ingrained to be
a nice Lutheran girl, but it basically breaks out once in a
while.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Unsurprisingly, Lieberg says much of what makes
a Midwesterner is tied to the soil.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I think the biggest thing that (being
Midwestern) means is to come out of this huge history of the
agricultural heritage, that we're all indebted to it in a big way
and many people are very active in it,&quot; she says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It's so visible still in the Midwest. I
think so many things about that history contribute to the way
people are in the Midwest. The golden rule, that's a big factor.
People want money in the Midwest, but it's a different attitude
about money than you see on the coasts. People very much believe
in hard work for the money.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Her time living elsewhere showed her that
&quot;People in the Midwest are more open,&quot; she says.
&quot;I mean, they don't have this layer of thinking that
somebody else has an agenda. I don't want to say they're just
honest, because they're not all honest. They don't seem to be
walking around with this veil of suspicion. I did notice that a
lot on the east coast.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But she recognizes that the people of the
Midwest are different, even within the region. For example, in
the Dakotas &quot;I think there's a real sense of that
Scandinavian background.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Generally, the differences &quot;have to do
with the ethnic groups that settled in each area, and of course
the areas that grew more urban, that changes everything,
too,&quot; Lieberg says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lieberg acknowledges that a similar book could
be done about any region of the country. &quot;Certainly, you
could do one on New England and the South,&quot; she says. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;One reason we're sort of happy to do it
on the Midwest is it's the one region that has gotten mostly
badmouthed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">She notes that Midwesterners have something of
an inferiority complex. Even she herself is not immune.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I find myself, when I talk about a couple
of friends in Princeton, I say, 'She's so New York, I wonder why
she's my friend?'&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>On fire for the Lord </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By DeAnne Hilgers<br>
The Forum</em></font><font size="4"><br>
One year ago, Robert Garcia was a boy with such an extensive
history of fighting that he'd been kicked out of one school and
couldn't get into another.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But that was a lifetime ago.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The 15-year-old Moorhead boy still bumps up
against other kids, but now it's twice a week in a friendly game
of basketball at a church youth group. His only fight is within
himself, to make a difference in his community and set a
Christian example for others.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Robert's transformation came about last spring,
literally overnight.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I felt I was going to change,&quot; he
says. &quot;It was a feeling like, you know, you're going to
pass&quot; a test.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It all happened when Garcia and his 14-year-old
cousin, Freddie Martinez, attended a retreat with others from
Fargo's First Assembly of God Church to listen to inspirational
speaker Christina Carroll.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Fargo woman suffered through abuse, a
miscarriage, divorce and a car accident that paralyzed her from
the chest down. She lost her job, her home. People no longer
treated her the same.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But God was there through it all, the Fargo
woman told the kids, and He would also be with them no matter how
bad their lives were.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The message touched Garcia and Martinez quickly
and deeply.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Even though we were doing bad things the
day before, that night we stayed up praying, asking God to
forgive us,&quot; Garcia says. &quot;I gave my life to Jesus
Christ that night.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They followed their promises with action,
traveling to Mexico on a mission trip last summer and joining in
youth activities at First Assembly. Now a year later, their faith
is more than a spark. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I'm on fire for the Lord,&quot; Martinez
says. &quot;When you accept the Lord, if you really know the
Lord, you can feel the change.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">No one is celebrating that change more than
Judy Kuehl, who's been part of First Assembly's youth programs
for 15 years.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The church sends buses into area communities to
pick up children &#150; up to 350 at a time &#150; on Saturdays.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">About nine years ago, Kuehl started a contest,
asking the kids on her bus route to bring a friend to the
activities. One Hispanic boy brought 29 visitors the first week,
16 the next. By the end of six weeks, the church was hosting 160
Hispanic kids.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This was a move of God,&quot; says Kuehl.
&quot;God brought in a population of people because He wanted
them ministered to.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">About six years ago, the church started a youth
group for the Hispanic kids, but many of them responded by
fighting, cutting up bus seats and spray painting graffiti, Kuehl
says. Four years ago, she started an alternative youth group but
still met with frustration.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;About the most consistent thing I did was
kick kids out,&quot; says Kuehl. &quot;For the next four years I
spent my time setting up boundaries. Sometimes I would get them
(to church) and turn around and take them right back home
again.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The behavior of some kids scared away
volunteers, and Kuehl was ready to quit. Then some of the kids in
her group were charged in the Cherryl Tendeland murder in West
Fargo.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;My first reaction was 'give those kids
the electric chair,'&quot; Kuehl says. &quot;I was ready to throw
in the towel. Maybe I did.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The slaying left her in tears, but it also
moved her to try again, starting a basketball group and Bible
study for kids in gangs or who wanted to be in gangs.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I felt like an idiot,&quot; Kuehl says.
&quot;I didn't even know how many people were supposed to be on a
basketball team.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Within three months, Kuehl had 27 kids in the
program.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The tone is you are the future leaders of
your community,&quot; Kuehl says. &quot;You can lead them to
drugs or you can lead them to God.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Many kids don't have good examples to follow.
They may have relatives in jail, running drugs or involved in a
gang. Some may be involved in it themselves.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;They don't want it,&quot; Kuehl says.
&quot;They want something different. Some of them are scared to
go out and get something different. They don't have access to
something different.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Freddie Martinez understands first hand.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I got involved with those kinds of
people,&quot; he says. &quot;I was doing bad things, stealing,
doing drugs, stealing and fighting and stealing.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Life wasn't all that great, he says. Then he
and Garcia found church and the First Assembly program. It hasn't
made life perfect, especially when they're outside the church and
under the influence of friends who smoke or drink.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We go down, but we talk to each other and
we bring each other back up,&quot; says Garcia, who has convinced
school officials to give him a chance.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;When we head off to church, we know we
have the power.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Does your love life suck? It's time to
break the rules</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By Tammy Swift<br>
The Forum </em></font><font size="4"><br>
If Rules girls are the dainty doves of the dating game, then
Breaking the Rules girls are the pterodactyls.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">You, of course, remember &quot;The Rules,&quot;
that outrageously popular book of dating advice that has been on
The New York Times Bestseller List since 1908 and sold roughly
400 kajillion copies.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The Rules,&quot; written by Ellen Fein
and Sherrie Schneider, offered counsel that could have come from
your great-grandmother: Never ask a man out, rarely return his
phone calls, don't let him know how smart you are, and never
accept a Saturday-night date after Wednesday. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Once these tactics are used to snag him, Fein
and Schneider actually suggest a woman continue practicing them
throughout married life.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In short: Live a lie and you'll be able to
manipulate that dopey, love-struck fool forever!</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It was almost like women had never left the
butter churn and Betty Friedan had become Betty Crocker. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Now Laura Banks and Janette Barber have hopped
aboard the lucrative Rules wagon to pen a five-week-turn-around
parody, &quot;Breaking the Rules: Last-Ditch Tactics for Landing
the Man of Your Dreams&quot; ($7.99, Career Press).</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In blatant contrast to the Rules' suggestions
to play hard to get, Barber and Banks advise being as hard to get
rid of as red nail polish on camel carpeting. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Breaking the Rules&quot; is outrageously
over the top &#150; not too surprising for Barber, a writer for
&quot;The Rosie O'Donnell Show,&quot; and Banks, an &quot;expert
on cyber-love&quot; who wrote &quot;Love OnLine&quot; (Career
Press, 1996). Both crow that they've unequivocally broken every
dating rule ever devised &#150; with tremendous success.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Typical BTR-isms:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="4">&quot;Treat each date like a free therapy
        session. Blather about your mother until he hates her,
        too, then nag and wheedle him into spending the weekend
        with her. It's amazing what he'll put up with &#150; and
        for how long &#150; if he has the faintest hope of just
        seeing your bra sometime before the next full moon.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">&quot;Another time-tested plan is to break
        into your favorite fellow's car and sit in the front seat
        until he comes out. Then surprise him with your best
        impression of Glenn Close in &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;
        and scream, &quot;Why didn't you call? Do you know how
        many pills I've already swallowed?&quot;</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">&quot;Let him know you've a mind to be
        reckoned with, a brain with far more important things to
        do than memorize baseball lineups from 1942 and the
        measurements of the last 18 Miss Teen USAs. Quote
        articles from the late issues of Cellular Microbiology
        and obscure Czech literary essays. If you're smarter than
        he is, you might as well rub his eyeballs in it.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">&quot;On a first date, your priority is to
        overwhelm him. Plant yourself on the steps of his
        apartment building on Friday morning so that he can see
        how much you are looking forward to your Saturday night
        date. When you see him for the first time, burst into
        tears and scream, &quot;I love, I love you, I love
        you!&quot; Every few minutes, no matter where you are,
        lay down on the floor and offer yourself to him. Keep
        mentioning marriage &#150; the marriage of ideas, the
        marriage of flour and water to make cake, The Marriage of
        Figaro. Let these casual mentions work their subliminal
        magic.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">&quot;Make your first date last at least
        48 hours. Never, never, ever end the date first, unless
        his ATM refuses to advance him more money. A BTR girl
        gives an impression of immense stamina. If he can stay
        out, so can you. If you are tired, take a nap. Many fine
        restaurants have rest rooms with comfortable chairs and
        sofas ... for during-the-date naps. He'll wait, because
        you've taken his wallet with you.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">&quot;If you can get yourself into his
        apartment on the first date it is, in fact, possible to
        simply never leave. Cry. Scream. Hold onto the doorjambs.
        Yell &quot;I'm carrying your baby, you monster!&quot;
        when the neighbors check out the scene.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">&quot;If a man can be driven away, he
        should be. You only want the needy types who stay no
        matter what. These are the men who will take any abuse
        you heap on them and still buy you things.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="4">Readers can sift through chapters titled:
&quot;How to end a dull date without committing a felony&quot;;
&quot;Married men take you to nicer restaurants,&quot; and
&quot;Be at your best with PMS (needy, clingy and whiny).&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Typical of their advice is this gem on meeting
men: &quot;Did we mention that police lineups are much better
than bars? These men are depressed, they're tired, they're
handcuffed and they're yours for the asking (if you have $500
bail).&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Does all this sound pushy, overbearing, perhaps
a wee bit INSANE? Good! &quot;BTR women just don't give a
damn,&quot; write Barber and Banks. Their tactics don't
&quot;give him a chance to talk to another woman he might find
more attractive.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Admittedly, &quot;Breaking the Rules,&quot; is
built on a one-joke premise, which means the material gets
threadbare by the book's conclusion. And yes, it capitalizes
shamelessly on &quot;The Rules&quot; success. (Of course, which
one of us doesn't wish we'd thought of it first?)</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It still offers a smart-alecky comeback to a
book that has left many women (and men) fuming. Better yet, it's
the ideal Valentine's Day gift for anyone with an ailing love
life and a robust sense of humor.</font></p>

<p><strong><img src="../../images/photo-heads/zaiser.jpg"
align="left" hspace="5" width="72" height="108"></strong><font
size="4"><strong>Catherine Zaiser: When it comes to fashion,
listen to your children </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">I knew I was taking a risk when I got dressed
on Sunday morning. I don't have an extensive wardrobe and so
sometimes, mostly out of boredom, I mix and match. I decided to
be bold. I belted and bunched and rolled until I came up with a
look. I'm not sure what kind of look, but definitely a look.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I made it out of the house, but when I hit the
Fellowship Hall for coffee and donuts, the fashion police
descended. My 13-year-old son cocked his head to the side, and
asked, &quot;What is that?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;What?&quot; I replied, self-consciously
glancing down at my ensemble.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;That,&quot; he said, pointing at my
clothing as if I was dripping with alien mucus.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I just thought I would try something
different,&quot; I said, trying to sound casual. &quot;Don't you
like it?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It looks stupid.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Well thanks a lot.&quot; (I've heard kids
don't learn tact until they graduate from college and need help
paying the rent.)</font></p>

<p><font size="4">All my 17-year-old daughter had to do was raise
one beautiful eyebrow and wrinkle her nose.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;What?&quot; I said, nervously adjusting
my wide, fake snake-skin belt.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;When did you decide that tan top and that
burgundy skirt went together?&quot;, she queried.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This morning,&quot; I said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Well, they don't.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Yes, they do.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;No they don't, Mom.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Unexpectedly, my gentleman friend came to the
rescue: &quot;It goes together just fine. I think your mother
looks nice.&quot; (He gained absolution from all sins before
church that morning.)</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The fact is, I will never again meld that
combination of garments. Sometimes you have to trust your
children. Frankly, they are the only human beings you can count
on to be brutally honest. Mothers come close, but they usually
couch criticism with compliments. (Example: &quot;You're hair
looks nice when it frames your face like that.&quot; Translation:
&quot;You don't look very good with your hair pulled back.&quot;)
I know. I do it to my kids all the time.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">So, when it comes to fashion, I trust my
children, which may be a weird thing for a grown woman to say,
but Vogue and Cosmo have never wielded much power in my life. I
hold on to favorite clothes too long. I say I'll shop for a new
outfit when I lose 10 pounds; and I never lose 10 pounds. I hate
trying on clothes because my hair fills with static and because I
don't like looking at my backside in a mirror. And, finally, if
it's not on sale, I can't (or refuse to) afford it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A few weeks ago, however, I did break down and
gave my closet a thorough cleaning. The impetus was provided by
another episode of &quot;You wore that to work?&quot; It seems
that what was a great pants outfit in the '80s doesn't make it in
the '90s. So, I weeded it out. Actually, she said the red sweater
would be OK, but I could never wear it with the red pants again.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">During the extracting process I had to swear
that if I kept my favorite royal blue sweatshirt with the buttons
and collar, I wouldn't ever wear it outside of the house. Ditto
for the long, hot pink sweater my daughter first wore in the
sixth grade.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I was allowed to turn one plaid shirt into a
paint shirt. A few items (relics) went into the costume closet
(we've got clothing from the 50s, 70s, 80s and today). I threw
out dozens of shoulder pads, which had multiplied in my underwear
drawer like frogs. And I let go of some beloved sweater vests I
wore in college.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It was a tremendously freeing experience.
Except now I have nothing to wear, in the sense that all women
who look into their closets in the morning say, &quot;I have
nothing to wear.&quot; Which is exactly why I'm putting together
these strange combinations. Actually my latest thought is that I
could simply dress in black all of the time and make that my
trademark, like Johnny Cash.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I like black. There'd be nothing garish to
embarrass my children. I could wash everything in cold water. I'd
never again be confronted with the issue of whether things
matched or not. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">And as far as I can tell, black never goes out
of style. But I expect I'd get bored with that too and then have
to try some outlandish hairstyles or get some funky jewelry.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">My kids would probably prefer that I just buy a
full length mirror and when I'm feeling creative, to check with
them for clearance. I can hear them now ... &quot;Lose the green
socks, tuck in your shirt and what's with the hoop
earrings?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It was a wise Jenny Joseph who wrote:
&quot;When I am on old woman I shall wear purple/ with a red hat
which doesn't go, and doesn't suit me ...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">When the kids are gone, I'll have no one to
dress me.</font></p>

<p><img src="../../images/photo-heads/swift.jpg" align="left"
hspace="5" width="72" height="96"><font size="4"><strong>Tammy
Swift: Farmhouse -- the stuff of memories </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">It was a weekend trip home to reunite with my
sisters, who I see only sporadically since they moved to balmy
Florida. It would be nice to visit, although our purpose for
gathering was bittersweet. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">We were going to clean our childhood home, as
its tenants had just moved. My sisters Mabel and Bertha had never
really said goodbye to the farmhouse. They had left for college,
our parents had slowly started moving themselves to town, and
before you knew it, we simply didn't live there anymore.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Our toys and religion class projects were still
stowed in the attic; Bertha's paperback books were still stacked
in her basement bedroom. My mother's first attempts at oil
painting still hung on the walls.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Our nostalgic mission would be doubly painful
for another reason: The house was neglected and broken. We felt
outrage at the previous tenants, who had once led a calf into the
house, which managed to kick a yawning hole in a wall. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The former occupants had sliced food directly
on the countertops, leaving hundreds of dirt-filled cuts on the
surface. Without asking, they had ripped carpeting out of a
bedroom. The tub looked as if it had never been scrubbed. A gray
film of dirty grease coated everything.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Didn't these people care? Didn't they know a
family had once lived here and loved this place? Of course they
didn't. Our house was a product, to be used, consumed, and tossed
away. They didn't own it, so why treat it with any respect?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I thought of the pride my parents had taken in
our home; the frenzied top-to-bottom cleaning it had received
every Saturday. I remembered the time spent picking the perfect
shade of blue curtains from the JC Penney catalog for a bedroom,
or the long summer days spent planting flowers and trimming the
lilac bushes that bordered our house. We kids whined and
complained about the work, but were secretly proud of our little
house, which stood square and white as a sugar cube.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">That was long ago. Just the stuff of memories.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Now it was our job to restore some of the
structure's dignity. At least the home wouldn't stand empty. The
new tenant was a trusted and responsible cousin, a member of the
family who could remember the days when chickens clucked in the
hen house and we played tag in the yard. Surely, he would feel
some connection to the house, and treat it accordingly.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">We painted, wallpapered, stripped woodwork and
scrubbed. In-between tasks, I walked from room to room, just
looking. A glance out the living room windows, warmed only
slightly by a chilly winter sun, confirmed why our childhood home
felt so different, and yet so unchanged. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Even though everything looked smaller today and
the furniture had been shoved to the middle of the room; outside,
the hills were slathered with a meringue of fresh snow. It was a
day just like hundreds of winter days past, when four sisters and
our little brother surged down the hills on toboggans.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the tiny room that once was my oldest
sister's, I daydreamed while brushing varnish over blond closet
doors. The memories were here too: my sisters listening to Sweet
and Kiss albums on the old Voice of Music turntable/eight-track;
the oh-so-'70s pink and red shag carpeting that we thought was
the coolest.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Here was the room where Bertha awoke from a
nightmare and thought the pine tree outside the window was a
vampire. The poor kid got so excited she fell out of her bunk
bed, which, unfortunately, was the top one. She landed, hitting
her head on Mabel's guitar with a noisy &quot;THWANG!&quot; My
mother rushed into the room in her white nightie, looking a shade
too ghostly to my sister. Mabel almost died of fright.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">That was it. No more &quot;Night Gallery&quot;
before bedtime.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Downstairs, I walked into the canning room and
saw the shelves of dust-coated milk bottles, many of them
untouched since my high school days. I glanced over at the
shower, with its 40-year-old fixtures, paint-chipped floor and
blue shower curtain.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In an instant, I was 6 again, standing in my
swimming suit in the shower to wash away the brown granules of
sand from an afternoon at the lake. I was 10 again, hanging
bedspreads across the canning room to create a &quot;haunted
house&quot; with my sisters. I was 14, and mixing milk
replacement in a heavy silver pail for an orphaned calf's nightly
feeding.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Our house could be defaced, vandalized, smashed
by a tornado. It wouldn't really matter. We would always remember
it just as it was.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Days later, after hours of work, the house
started to regain its glow. Its walls gleamed, its floor
sparkled, it almost looked occupied. It was as if time had not
passed at all; as if we'd never left.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In a sense, we never had.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Vanyo family goes Navy all the way</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By Bob Lind <br>
The Forum </em></font><font size="4"><br>
It's not exactly like being a student at West Fargo High School.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sitting absolutely erect while eating. Being
quizzed about any number of things at any time. Not speaking
unless an upperclassman speaks first.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">For first year students at the military
academies &#150; and specifically, in the case of the Vanyo
siblings, the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md.
&#150; this is the way it is. But, as in the case of the Vanyos,
they tough it out, even under the most trying circumstances, as
when Army wins the Army-Navy game.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jolene Vanyo is undergoing that first year now;
she will have the distinction of being a member of the class of
the year 2000. Her brother Brian survived his first year earlier.
He now is one of those tough upperclassmen, a member of the class
of '98.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Both are following in the steps of their sister
Michelle, who graduated from Annapolis last year. Michelle, still
living in Maryland, has opted to forgo a military career and is
applying for law school.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Vanyo siblings are the children of Darrell
and Dena Vanyo, West Fargo, neither of whom was in the military.
But Darrell says, &quot;When I go there (to the Naval Academy), I
kind of get goosebumps. I kind of wonder if I should have looked
at this when I was younger.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">High expectations</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Life isn't easy at the academy, but the
training and education is terrific, Brian and Jolene say. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jolene says she's doing &quot;OK' in her
schoolwork, and Brian, with a 3.65 grade point average, is
hopeful of becoming one of only 25 students picked for a select
graduate program.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Do first-year students, called plebes, really
catch it from the upper classmen?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jolene and Brian look at each other.
&quot;There is some yelling at the plebes,&quot; Brian says, and
both laugh. But Brian says he doesn't get into that too much. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">First year students are indoctrinated during
&quot;Plebe Summer,&quot; the seven weeks prior to fall classes.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They're told their lives will be highly
regimented, because they no longer are individuals; they're all
part of a team.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They learn the rules: no drinking of pop is
allowed during Plebe Summer, for instance.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They pour aching muscles into physical fitness
and athletic activities, beginning every day at 6 a.m. with 50
minutes of calisthenics.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The plebes, both men and women, participate in
many sports, except women substitute hand-to-hand combat for
boxing.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Once classes begin, all 4,000 midshipman live
in the huge Bancroft Hall where, when they aren't studying,
they're making sure their rooms are almost surgically clean.
Plebes can be sure those upperclassmen will be around checking
every corner with a white glove and a black sock.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Everyone eats in the 65,000 square foot
&quot;wardroom&quot; where no plebe speaks unless an
upperclassman speaks first, and where the plebes make sure the
upperclassmen have their food and drink before they dare take a
bite.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jolene had heard about all this from Michelle
and Brian, &quot;so I sort of knew what to expect; but it was
still a shock,&quot; she says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Commitment required</font></p>

<p><font size="4">With all this pressure, Brian and Jolene still
say they are glad they're at Annapolis. Brian feels that when
their service years are up, &quot;We'll have good shots at jobs,
because of the training we get. And instead of paying tuition, we
get paid.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">They have a five-year Navy commitment after
they graduate. Brian, however, is thinking of studying to be a
navigator; that would mean an additional two years to get his
wings and a six-year commitment.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They currently have another major commitment:
attendance at the annual Army-Navy football game. But Brian and
Jolene say they wouldn't want to miss it, anyhow.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The ceremony at the game is something to
behold, according to their parents, who attended the game in
Philadelphia last year.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It's like a Super Bowl atmosphere,&quot;
Darrell says. &quot;I'm not a football fan, but this game is
unbelievable,&quot; Dena says. &quot;When all the midshipmen and
(Army) cadets march in, well ...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">All midshipmen are pumped up for the game.
&quot;They have us yelling, 'Go Navy, Beat Army' from Day
1,&quot; Jolene says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jolene, who is on the cross country team, says
it's a tradition that when the team, in training, reaches the top
of a hill, they yell, &quot;Go Navy, Beat Army.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Unhappily for Navy, all that enthusiasm didn't
work; again this year, as it has often recently, Army won.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Part of the team</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jolene, meanwhile, is more than holding her own
in cross country; she is the No. 3 runner on the team.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Brian sees a difference in the way he and his
friends back home spend their summers. While they're out hunting
for summer jobs, he is taking more training. After his first year
at the academy, he went on a cruise down the East Coast. Jolene
will be doing that this summer, also.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">There's still another Vanyo coming up. The
youngest, Sarah, is a sophomore at West Fargo High.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At this point, it's not known if Sarah, too,
will seek an appointment to Annapolis.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Her mom, while making it clear the academy is
&quot;a very good school,&quot; confesses that it &quot;would be
kind of nice to have one of them (her children) go to a
'civilian' school.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It was tough, sending them off. It's so
rigorous, especially that first year,&quot; she says, sounding
very motherly. But, concerning Jolene returning to the academy
after Christmas, &quot;You feel better when you know she's
excited about going back, and she was.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dena and Darrell know first-hand how tough the
classes at the academy are.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They once sat in on Michelle's weapons
engineering class. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I understood it when the instructor
welcomed everyone when the class started, and I understood it
when he said the class was over,&quot; Dena says, &quot;but I
didn't understand anything in between.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Preservation Hall Bank brings New
Orleans jazz to Moorhead </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By Ross Raihala<br>
The Forum</em></font><font size="4"><br>
The fans usually start lining up at 6 every evening to assure
their spot in Preservation Hall, a 247-year-old building nestled
in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Open seven nights a week all year long,
Preservation Hall doesn't sell food and it doesn't sell liquor.
The space can't hold much more than the 100 patrons who crowd
onto the few wood benches or stand in the back. Yet they keep
piling in night after night for one simple reason. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;People just come in to listen to the
music,&quot; says Ben Jaffe, the 26-year-old string bass player
who runs the place. New Orleans' jazz legends and up-and-comers
fill the hall's four groups, all of which perform under the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band moniker. Jaffe's combo &#150; led by
trumpeter Wendell Brunious &#150; will perform at Concordia
College Tuesday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;A lot of people think our name means that
we preserve traditional New Orleans jazz,&quot; says Jaffe.
&quot;But I've always felt it means that we're preserving the
musicians who perform that style.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Roots in the '60s</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jaffe's parents Allan and Sandra founded
Preservation Hall in 1961. He was a department store manager and
she was a typesetter for an advertising agency when the
Philadelphia couple ventured to New Orleans for their honeymoon.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Hungry for traditional New Orleans jazz, the
newlyweds could find it only in an art gallery where the owner
featured jam sessions on the weekends. Allan and Sandra struck up
a friendship with the man and ended up taking over the building,
which was reborn as Preservation Hall.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;They said they'd try it out for a
year,&quot; Jaffe says. &quot;And it has been more successful
than they could have ever imagined.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The elder Jaffe ran it until his death in 1987.
Sondra took over managing the hall until Ben graduated in 1993.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At the time of Preservation Hall's birth, bebop
and big band were the fashion, leaving an older generation in the
shadows. &quot;My parents discovered there was no place for older
musicians to play, a lot of them were working on the docks or not
working at all. It wasn't easy for an older black person to make
a living in New Orleans in the late '50s and early '60s,&quot;
Jaffe says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Jazz musicians were used to being treated
like dirt. And here they were, finally being respected and being
treated like artists, professionals and human beings. It's hard
for us to conceive of that these days, but in the 1960s, it was a
real issue.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">After Preservation Hall began rediscovering
these old jazz artists, it sparked a renaissance in the public's
consciousness. The Jaffes started touring their bands almost
immediately after opening with great success. These days,
Preservation Hall musicians are on the road four months each
year.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Not whistlin' Dixie</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jaffe says New Orleans jazz is an integral part
of the city's culture &#150; it's performed at everything from
funerals to parades &#150; and is often mistaken for Dixieland by
outsiders. &quot;When I think of Dixieland, I think of guys in
straw hats and red-striped vests kicking their legs up in the
air. That's not what we do.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Instead, New Orleans jazz draws from the
diversity of the people who populate the city. &quot;At the turn
of the century, New Orleans was a mixing pot of people from
Mexico, the Caribbean, Africa and France,&quot; Jaffe says.
&quot;The black community took those influences and created
something new.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jaffe says the Preservation Hall sound speaks
honestly to people. &quot;This music is performed for the
audience and the musicians never forget that. We'll look out into
the crowd and see a 3-year-old bouncing along next to someone in
their 70s who is humming along and clapping. Most of our audience
has no musical background, but they understand it and we somehow
touch them.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Local jazz fans should be prepared to be
touched, too. &quot;A lot of times, people don't know how to
react to the music,&quot; Jaffe says. &quot;No one wants to be
the first to get up and start dancing, but it happens. We do our
best to make people comfortable and I don't think we've ever
played a concert where people weren't happy.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Enjoying yourself in New Orleans is part of the
lifestyle, Jaffe says. In fact, &quot;the only thing missing from
our concert is a good bowl of gumbo.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>First fall Arbitron ratings show only
minor changes</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By Ross Raihala<br>
The Forum</em></font><font size="4"><br>
The big news from the new Arbitron radio ratings is that there
isn't much big news.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Nothing's too shocking,&quot; says
Mid-States Broadcasting vice president Ed Schultz. &quot;There
really haven't been any drastic changes. I think it was a good
book for radio and there were some very positive things for
everybody.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">KFGO AM &quot;The Mighty 790&quot; remains
Fargo-Moorhead's highest rated station, followed by the country
hits on Froggy 99.9 FM.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Most stations took a dip of a share point or
two, with Moose Country 102 weathering the toughest blow. On the
other hand, KQWB AM's &quot;Unforgettable&quot; format and 95X's
modern rock line-up saw healthy increases.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">This is the first time Arbitron has conducted a
fall listener survey in Fargo-Moorhead. For years, stations had
to rely on an annual spring survey to measure audience size and
to set advertising rates.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">With a twice-yearly system, stations can more
accurately track listener trends. The new Arbitron sample traced
the listening habits of several hundred metro residents from
Sept. 19 to Dec. 11. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">It reflects increased stability across the
board after a series of buy-outs that left two radio station
superpowers (Mid-States Broadcasting and Results Radio) in
control of 10 stations.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Six months ago, stations like KFGO AM and Q98
saw tremendous gains, while others like KVOX AM and 107.9 The Fox
tumbled. Overall, Mid-States won big in country and talk, with
Results posting strong numbers for its contemporary formats.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;(Now) there's more parity in the
marketplace,&quot; says Nancy Odney, vice president of Results
Radio. &quot;Overall, each group has got some good, quality
stations.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Mid-States posted improved numbers with its
modern rock station 95X, which had previously under performed,
despite high-profile air personalities and heavy promotion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We're very pleased with 95X,&quot;
Schultz says. &quot;We had a 40 percent increase in audience and
we scored extremely well in the demographic we're targeting,
which is men and women, 18-34. The X could be a sleeping giant.
But we're not there yet.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Mid-States faced heavy public scrutiny when it
premiered 95X on the frequency long known as KOOL 95, an oldies
rock station. In response, the company converted KVOX 1280 AM to
the oldies and saw the ratings drop in the new book.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We've got a lot of work to do with Oldies
1280,&quot; Schultz says. &quot;I don't know what the potential
of that station actually is.&quot; To start with, Mid-States is
going to bring in David Berdahl for a 6 to 9 morning show. Better
known as Davey Bee, Berdahl owns Beehive Music in Fargo and is
known for his passion for oldies rock.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Mid-States also bought contemporary Christian
station Power 92 in December and converted it to Sunny 92, a
light contemporary music format. The sale took place after the
Arbitron rating period.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;If Sunny 92 could come out and get
between a 4 and 6 share (in the next Arbitrons), we would be
ecstatic,&quot; Schultz says. &quot;A radio station like that
needs to be consistent and grow on people.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Odney reports her company is thrilled with how
its stations performed. &quot;They were right on target,&quot;
she says. &quot;Q98 is No. 1 with adults, 18-34. The Fox is No. 1
with men, 25-54. Lite Rock is No. 1 with women, basically across
the board.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Long-time KLTA morning favorite Dan Michaels
returned to the station for its morning show, joined by Jane
Alexander, formerly of KFGO FM. The move boosted KLTA to the
second highest share of FM listeners during the important
&quot;drive-time&quot; 6 to 10 a.m.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In 1996, Results purchased the former
all-sports station KQFN AM, changed its call letters to KQWB and
switched to the adult standards format, better known as
&quot;Unforgettable&quot; music. Listeners responded and boosted
the share from 0.4 to 3.0.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It's an audience that's been proved in
many other markets that we'll continue to develop,&quot; she
says. &quot;I think the station's got some really great
potential.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">With two books a year, Schultz says the local
industry is learning a lot about its listeners. &quot;It's two
report cards versus one,&quot; he says. &quot;I like that
idea.&quot; Odney agrees and says she feels rating periods every
six months will give a more accurate picture of listener habits.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;All of the primary formats are
covered,&quot; Odney says. &quot;There is something for everyone.
Now that we have a little more consistency, I think listeners
will find both groups are going to deliver great radio, great
personalities, great entertainment and great music.&quot;</font></p>

hspace="5" width="72" height="108"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>Dorothy
Collins: Designer greens hot this season </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">If you are a greens lover, you may know about
mesclun, which have been called the designer greens of our
gardens. 1997 is being celebrated by the National Garden Bureau
as the Year of the Mesclun.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The first task, of course, is to define
mesclun. A French word for mixture, it is a recent import from
Provencal France. Mesclun is a mixture of tender young lettuces
and other greens. The Provencal traditional mixes call for
chervil, arugula, lettuce and endive in precise proportions.
American mescluns may include lettuces, arugula, endives,
mustards, purslane, chicory, cresses, parsleys, fennels, escarole
and tender wild greens as well.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lettuce, believed to have originated in central
Asia, was used as an herbal medicine as well as an edible since
as early at 500 BC. It is one of the oldest of our vegetables.
The four types of lettuce are looseleaf, cos (romaine),
butterhead and crisphead.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The looseleaf varieties, which are the backbone
of most mescluns, are also the easiest to grow. An old variety
that is quite heat resistant is Oakleaf, a handsome green lettuce
with leaves that are distinctly like those of oaks. Prizehead is
a reddish green, known best for its crisp sweetness. Black Seeded
Simpson is a fast growing green leaf lettuce which is also
popular.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lettuces are most often in the milder blends of
mescluns. There are also piquant and peppery meslcuns, which
include such varieties as sharp arugula, tangy mustards, spicy
cresses and zesty chicory. The National Garden Bureau recommends
planting the piquant and milder muscluns in separate wide rows,
then harvesting each separately and mixing in proportions to suit
the occasion, the meal and personal taste.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">You can also use edible flowers or their
petals, such as bachelor's buttons, calendulas, chive blossoms,
marigolds, nasturtiums and violets, in the mesclun. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">You will probably want to plant the mesclun in
the vegetable or herb garden, but there is nothing to prevent
growing it somewhere in the flower border. Of course, if you snip
it with the scissors every week, it might be hard on the looks of
the flower design, so some gardeners make it into a border to a
perennial bed. Then you can harvest with scissors instead of
pulling the plants, starting when they are a couple of inches
high, never letting them get more than six inches tall. Thus, the
crop will then continue to grow and they will regrow quickly. Cut
the leaves just above the growing crowns.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">You can get mesclun seed from any reputable
seed company. They will offer different mixtures so you can get
what suits your fancy or your personal likes. Plant early in good
soil. Grow in sun. Seed will germinate in 6 to 14 days. The seed
packet will tell you. You can begin to harvest young leaves in
one to five weeks. You can make successive plantings, seeding
every 10 days to two weeks from spring through fall. You should
then have mescluns for salads and stir-fry dishes all season
long.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">After you have snipped mesclun for a meal,
rinse the leaves in cool water to remove dust or dirt and examine
them for critters. If you spin dry them, be sure to use them
right away since this process bruises the leaves and they will go
limp quickly. Use them right away if you can, otherwise wrap the
leaves gently in slightly damp towels, seal in a plastic bag and
place in the refrigerator. They should stay tasty and fresh for
several days.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Serve the mesclun with a bit of light
vinaigrette dressing. When stir fried in a bit of butter or hot
oil the mesclun makes a delicious addition to fresh vegetable
dishes or pastas. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Looseleaf lettuces, as you probably know, are
very healthy. They are loaded with Vitamin A and are high in
potassium.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Building into big business<br>
Remodeling a necessary part of home improvement</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><em>By Jonathan Knutson <br>
The Forum <br>
</em>Fire whipped through the Glenn and Dorothy Albin home in
Harwood, N.D., last November. The upper level of the house
sustained extensive fire and smoke damage, the rest of the house
smoke and water damage.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But the damage soon will be completely
repaired, thanks to Mike Duval, who sometimes thinks of
remodeling contractors like himself as the Rodney Dangerfields of
the construction world: They get no respect.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Everybody wants to build the big new
house from scratch. That's the glamour job. We get sort of
ignored. I'm biased, but I think it takes just as much skill, if
not more, to take what's already there and make it better,&quot;
said Duval, president of Rick Duval Construction of Fargo.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Respected or not, home remodeling is a very big
business. About $75 billion was spent on home improvements
nationwide last year, and another $42 billion went for
maintenance and repair. Those numbers are expected to grow by 4
percent or 5 percent annually for the next few years.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Fargo, Moorhead, West Fargo and Dilworth issued
residential remodeling permits totaling about $10 million last
year. That figure doesn't include all the projects for which a
permit isn't required.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The growing amount of residential remodeling,
especially work done with professional help, seems to be caused
by several things. The first is that nearly 30 percent of
American houses were built before 1930; their owners want
amenities like decks that were uncommon when those houses were
built. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Another reason for more professionally done
remodeling: More two-income families that can afford to have the
work done for them.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Almost all of our customers have two
incomes in the family,&quot; Duval said. &quot;They've got the
resources to improve their home.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Residential remodeling in our area also has
benefited from an unholy assortment of blizzards, floods and
deluges. Homes damaged by bad weather must be repaired &quot;and
insurance reconstruction counts as remodeling, too,&quot; Duval
said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">One of home remodeling's biggest attractions is
increasing the house's value. Much of the money spent on
improvement can be recouped when the house is sold. That makes a
homeowner far more likely to spend money on remodeling.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Here's a look at some of the most popular
projects in our area.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Finishing a basement. Roughly half the time
this is a do-it-yourself project. Many new homes, especially
less-expensive ones, are sold with an unfinished basement. In
effect, homebuyer pays less for the house in exchange for doing
some of the work themselves.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It's difficult to say how much it would cost to
hire a professional to finish your basement. The cost depends on
how elaborate you want the basement to be.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But hiring a professional to build a bathroom
and family room in the basement costs about $10,000.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Building a garage. A do-it-yourself project
that's highly popular in our area.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Every year we tell ourselves that there
won't possibly be as many permits for garages as there was last
year,&quot; said Bill Eide with the city of Fargo building
inspections department. &quot;But every year there is. People
just want bigger garages today because they've got more cars in
the family.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The best estimate is that, using your own
labor, it costs about $6,000 to build a garage in the F-M area.
Numbers aren't available on how much of that cost can be
recouped, but it's clear that a bigger garage adds to the value
of the property.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Remodeling a kitchen. This typically is done in
older homes. A minor project - repainting, replacing cabinet
doors, oven and cooktop, and laminating countertops, faucet and
floor - costs about $5,100, using professional labor. Of that
amount, about 80 percent can be recouped if the house is sold. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">A major project - redesigning the kitchen,
adding custom lighting and replacing all the items mentioned
above - costs about $18,400, using professional labor. Of that
amount, about 87 percent can be recouped if the house is sold.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In some parts of the country, remodeling the
kitchen is an even better deal. In Washington D.C., for example,
spending $8,150 on the kitchen adds $11,000 to the house's resale
value. That means 135 percent of the job's cost is recouped.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Adding a deck or family room. &quot;The phrase
today is 'increased living space',&quot; Duval said. &quot;That
usually means a deck or family room.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In our area, a 320-square-foot deck costs about
$5,200, using professional labor. Given our weather and the
relatively short period of time a deck can be used, it should be
no great surprise that only 59 percent of that amount can be
recouped. In Honolulu, in contrast, about 120 percent of the cost
of a deck can be recouped.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We've been building decks here for quite
a while,&quot; said Rick Halvorson of Rick Halvorson Construction
in Moorhead. &quot;But they've become more elaborate in the past
few years.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In our area, a 400-square-foot family room
costs about $28,000. About two-thirds of that amount can be
recouped.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Replacing siding. The cost of replacing 1,250
square feet of siding with new vinyl or aluminum is about is
about $4,400. About 80 percent of that amount can be recouped. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Local builders and city building officials say
many F-M area residents typically start thinking seriously about
remodeling in mid- to late February. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Builders and city officials offer several
suggestions for anyone considering a remodeling project this
spring:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="4">Check with your city building inspections
        department to learn if a permit is required.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">Keep in mind that newer homes as well as
        older ones might benefit from remodeling.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">When considering whether you could afford
        a project, be sure to determine how much of the cost
        could be recouped if you sold your home.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">If possible, try to contact a builder a
        month before you'd like work to begin. All the snow we've
        had this winter apparently has caused considerable roof
        damage, which may cause contractors to be unusually busy
        this spring.</font></li>

banks</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Open a national business or investment magazine
these days and odds are good that you'll read great things about
Norwest Corp. and First Bank System.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Minneapolis-based financial services
companies are drawing rave reviews from investment and management
professionals nationwide. With good reason: Both companies are
well-managed, profitable and have rewarded their shareholders
handsomely in recent years.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Certainly both have made their mark in
Fargo-Moorhead area. The two are the two biggest banking
companies, measured by deposits, in the F-M area. Both operate
large &quot;back room&quot; facilities in Fargo that employ
hundreds of people to do things like process checks.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Despite their similarities, though, an
important difference has emerged.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">First Bank believes strongly in the future of
electronic banking. The company's top officials think the
Internet and electronic banking hold great promise to provide
faster and more convenient service. First Bank thinks that will
appeal to a growing number of customers, particularly younger
ones.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In contrast, top Norwest officials express
skepticism about the Internet. They say they'll continue to
stress hands-on, personal contact with customers. They think
that's what most customers want.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">So is one right and the other wrong? Or perhaps
they're both right; perhaps each will succeed by filling
different market segments?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">These are questions most bankers, not just
those working for First Bank and Norwest, are asking themselves
these days. The number of banks nationwide is declining steadily
and continued survival allows scant room for error. The thinking
of successful companies like Norwest and First Bank inevitably
draws attention from other companies in the industry.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Some people view banking as a complicated,
mysterious industry beyond the ken of ordinary folk. That's
nonsense. Banking is like any other business: To be successful,
you give your customers what they want. The trick, of course, is
to figure out what that is.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Whither banking? What do customers want?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">We'll learn the answer by looking at the
relative success of Norwest and First Bank in coming years.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">One thing already is certain. Consumers will be
well served by having a choice.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>On second thought ...<br>
Heading wheat processing firm challenged Lee to job </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By Mikkel Pates<br>
The Forum </em></font><font size="4"><br>
When an executive headhunter called Gary Lee about becoming
president of United Spring Wheat Processors, he quickly declined.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Who could blame him?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">As a vice president for Cargill's dry milling
division in its Minneapolis headquarters, Lee seemed set for
life. Why come to North Dakota to a farmer-owned cooperative that
doesn't have a product or a market yet?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Then I thought, here I've got &#150;
literally from scratch &#150; the opportunity to start a
business,&quot; Lee says. &quot;The entrepreneurial strings in me
were plinging away.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Before leaving work that day, Lee went to
Cargill's information center and gathered a stack of stories on
USWP an inch thick. He acquired three years of American Crystal
Sugar Co. annual reports and pored over those. Two USWP directors
were former Crystal directors and Crystal is the model for
producer relations, investment and capitalization.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;That Monday I called back and said count
me in,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The USWP board of directors hired him in late
October and he started as president and chief executive officer
on Nov. 15.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The cooperative has now completed its series of
producer meetings.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">USWP currently is a four-state cooperative of
4,753 members that likely will become a $100 million business.
The goal is to create an equity fund to build a business around
the region's high-quality spring wheat crop.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Members who donated $200 in up-front
&quot;seed&quot; funds must put another $4,800 each in an escrow
fund by Monday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lee will help the group select a business
opportunity and expects to present a business plan next fall.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He figures members will then buy a block of two
to four blocks of stock at about $5,000 each. That would raise
roughly $50 million in producer equity, which could be matched by
debt for a $100 million business.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I think it's interesting that the average
investment in these cooperatives tends to be the value of a
pickup truck, for some funny reason,&quot; Lee says. &quot;Quite
a few producers tell me they'll put off buying that pickup truck
for a year.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The vision is to market the 1998 spring wheat
crop through the cooperative.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The board will sift business alternatives
(grain merchandising, handling/conditioning, flour milling,
frozen dough manufacturing, among them) and rate them on a
weighted point system. Things like return on investment, market
size and spring wheat usage will play heavily into the decision.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">With a list of top three alternatives, Lee and
board members will travel to potential competitors and customers
over the next three months to validate their assumptions.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We potentially could control a lot of the
spring wheat in the country,&quot; Lee says. &quot;It's (our
competitors') best interest to figure out if there's a way we can
work together.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The final choice will be very consumer-driven.
It could involve building a plant, buying a business, or none of
the above.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I could develop a scenario to integrate
this supply concept without owning a single asset other than a
really good computer, to manage information,&quot; Lee says,
smiling. He notes that the soft drink company that supplies
Wal-Mart stores nationwide doesn't own a bottling plant.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lee, 45, grew up in Stamford, Conn. His father
was executive director of the American Marketing Association, a
corporate management association.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At age 12, Lee would accompany his father to
Key Biscayne, Fla., on corporate jets for management seminars. He
remembers golfing with the president of General Foods.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I learned real early that &#150; yeah,
they're industrial moguls, but they're also just nice guys,&quot;
Lee recalls. &quot;I don't think I'm intimidated by anybody as a
result of some of those connections.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the summers he visited his grandfather's
fruit farm at Fennville, Mich. &quot;He had a strong work ethic,
he built his own house, barn, picking ladders,&quot; Lee says.
&quot;He was a very self-sufficient guy, who I would describe as
top-quality American farm stock. And a smart businessman
too.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lee's father semi-retired to become director of
business institutes at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
Lee enrolled there because of the free tuition and immediately
was turned on to entrepreneurship.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Out of college Lee took jobs in pharmaceutical
sales with E.R. Squibb and an industrial finance job with
Westinghouse.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He moved to Cargill and eventually became one
of about 100 vice presidents for the dry milling division, which
accounts for about $2 billion in worldwide sales.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Among other things, he helped create Cargill
Foods. This unified marketing for the company's vast $20 billion
in food-related enterprises, which together ranks third among
U.S. food companies.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;When you're working in a company the size
of Cargill and you're trying to make changes in something on the
magnitude of Cargill Foods it's rewarding, but there are more
frustrations than rewards.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This job gives me the opportunity to
create the corporate culture, which I could not have done at
Cargill.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lee says former colleagues have encouraged him.
Others shrewdly see USWP's potential as a competitor. In the past
five years cooperatives have come into their own in manufacturing
because of critical advantages.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">For starters, corporations get taxed on their
profits, and the investors get taxed on what they take out.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>North Dakota wheat midge outlook
improves</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><em>By Mikkel Pates<br>
The Forum <br>
</em>Orange wheat blossom midge may be a smaller problem to most
North Dakota farmers in 1997 than it was in 1996.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The potential for damage is not nearly as
great as last year so we're relieved by that,&quot; says Terry
Gregoire, an area agronomist with North Dakota State University's
Extension Service in the hot spot area around Devils Lake.
&quot;We're going to maintain the same scouting effort we had
last year. We will have to be vigilant.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Cocoon numbers are down, based on a fall soil
survey that covers areas of the state north and east of the
Missouri River.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The heaviest midge areas in Ramsey, Benson and
Towner counties will probably have localized hot spots, Gregoire
says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The 1996 survey shows regional densities
ranging from 220 to 500 midge cocoons per square meter. That's
down from the highs of 1,100 found in the 1995 survey. The survey
costs $16,000 and is funded by the North Dakota Wheat Commission.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">This year's survey was expanded to include much
of southern North Dakota after field scouting showed midges in
1996. The cocoon numbers show potential problems in central
Dickey and LaMoure counties.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Mike Weiss, an NDSU research entomologist in
Fargo, says he's tickled about the overall reductions.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I think the reduction is due to climatic
conditions,&quot; Weiss says. Weather records show females had
half of the potential time to deposit eggs in 1996 than they had
in 1995. To lay eggs, the midges need warm, still conditions at
night.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The mosquito-like midge can be a devastating
pest. When eggs hatch, larvae crawl into the glume and feed on
kernels, leaving them shriveled.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Losses to the state's wheat crop were estimated
at $27 million in 1995, but were minimal in 1996 because of early
warnings and spraying.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Still, up to 800,000 acres were sprayed in
North Dakota last year at a cost of roughly $8 million. Another
million acres weren't sprayed because levels found by scouts
didn't reach economic thresholds. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;A lot will depend on the egg-laying
conditions, our date of seeding, and some other cultural
techniques we use to reduce damage,&quot; Gregoire says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Factors that prevent midge damage include
planting early, using early-maturing varieties, alternative
crops, and certain rotations.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="4">Minnesota - Jochum Wiersma, a University
        of Minnesota small- grains specialist at Crookston, says
        there were no fall surveys for cocoons in his state.<br>
        &quot;With growing-degree models we can predict emergence
        and then it's a matter of scouting fields at susceptible
        stages,&quot; Wiersma says.He estimates about $1 million
        in damage last year and 100,000 to 150,000 acres sprayed,
        based on chemical sales.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">Manitoba -Manitoba midge surveys indicate
        slightly bigger problems in 1997.<br>
        Fall surveys show that nearly one in 20 acres, or about
        2.9 million acres in Manitoba, are in high- or
        very-high-risk categories. Not all those will be planted
        to wheat, says Keith Mills, a provincial agronomist for
        Manitoba in the Carman district west of Winnipeg.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="4">Still, that's up 660,000 acres from high-risk
levels indicated by the fall survey a year earlier. High-risk is
1,200 cocoons per square meter or greater.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">This year's hottest spots are roughly in the
first 20 miles southeast of Winnipeg and in pockets in a 100-mile
radius north and south of Brandon. &quot;Otherwise levels are not
extreme in the Red River Valley,&quot; Mills says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Last year Manitoba farmers sprayed an estimated
523,000 acres for midge, Mills says. That's about 12 percent of
4.28 million wheat acres in the province.</font></p>

Mapleton man wonders what will happen in the spring</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>By Dave Wallis <br>
The Forum<br>
MAPLETON, N.D.</em></font><font size="2"><em> </em>&#150;</font><font
size="4"> Jeff Harland has plenty of shoveling to do every time
the wind blows and deposits snow around his home and other
residents on the north side of Mapleton. &quot;Last year was
about the same, otherwise it's never been anything like
this,&quot; recalls Harland, who has lived in Mapleton 25 years.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Harland estimates the height of a giant drift
next to his home to be around 16 feet high. &quot;It's a natural
drift made just by the old wind,&quot; he says, explaining that
he blows snow out of his driveway to the other side or across the
street. &quot;If my truck is sitting there (in the driveway),
it's buried,&quot; he says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Using a shovel and snowblower and starting from
inside the garage, he blows what he can and then shovels the
higher spots down to blower level. &quot;I've had to come out the
patio window in the back twice to shovel out the front
door,&quot; he says, describing the waist-high drift blocking the
east side of his home.&quot;I hate to see what it'll look like
when this stuff melts. We're going to have a big mess. Lots of
sump pumps are going to be sold,&quot; he predicts. With a heavy
sigh he adds, &quot;It isn't over yet.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Winter Show sets full schedule</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Mikkel Pates<br>
The Forum <br>
</font><font size="4">The 60th North Dakota Winter Show is back
in the saddle for good.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The full schedule will run April 17 to 27, the
board announced Tuesday in Valley City. This confirms tentative
plans announced a week ago.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The show had been in limbo since Jan. 20 when
its all-steel Behlen building caved in under a heavy snow load.
The distinctive building looks like a huge farm shed, with a
horsehoe-like profile.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Once we had the facts, it was the easiest
decision we've made in a long time,&quot; manager Dale Hildebrant
said, emerging from board meetings with insurance companies and
the contractor.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The snow has been removed,&quot;
Hildebrant said Tuesday. &quot;They're going to start shoring up
the north side of the east end (today). Within a couple of weeks
we're going to start seeing the damaged portion start being
removed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Winter Show board met Tuesday with North
Dakota Insurance Commissioner Glenn Pomeroy and other insurance
officials. They spoke by phone with Bill Dreifurst, owner of
B&amp;D Construction at Columbus, Neb. Dreifurst's company
specializes in constructing the Behlen Manufacturing Co. steel
buildings and was part of the crew that built the Valley City
structure in the 1960s.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The board formally hired B&amp;D as the general
contractor on Tuesday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Dreifurst was pressed for a time frame
and he said that without a large amount of problems they're going
to have the shell done by March 20,&quot; Hildebrant said.
&quot;That'll give us time to do electrical work and cleanup in
here.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Hildebrant said officials of the North Dakota
Insurance Department, the prime insurance company, and Travelers
Indemnity Co. had to compromise on some issues to make the
project go.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Chiefly, they had to agree that there wouldn't
be time to solicit competitive bids as is typically done.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A self-insurance plan run by the Insurance
Department picks up the first $1 million in damage. Traveler's
handles the rest - now estimated at another $1 million. There may
be some asbestos removal in one of the walls, Hildebrant said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dreifurst also assured the companies that he
didn't expect an unusual amount of overtime hours to be added to
the project.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Sammy Kershaw country music concert is now
rescheduled to April 24, as previously announced. Tickets for the
7 p.m. show are available at the Winter Show office (800)
437-0218 or at most area Stop-N-Go outlets. Tickets are $17 for
general admission and $20 for reserved seating. Those go to $20
and $23, respectively, the day of the show.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Hildebrant said the show will not reprint
tickets to the concert or the rodeo. Ticket holders with
conflicts should call the show office.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The show's major expense with the six-week
delay will be reprinting of some brochures and some additional
advertising.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We're just delighted to have one of these
original, one-of-a-kind Behlen buidings, sound and ready to run a
show in April,&quot; Hildebrant said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Goals 2000 sparks heated debate</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - Supporters and detractors
of Goals 2000 squared off at a legislative hearing Wednesday,
offering widely contrasting views of the national
school-improvement initiative.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Goals 2000 is a U.S. Department of
Education-sponsored initiative that directs federal money to
local school districts, with a goal of increasing graduation
rates, raising academic standards and other general improvements
in the education system.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Critics of the initiative, who tend to get very
passionate about the subject, claim that Goals 2000 promotes
social engineering, immoral curriculum standards and takes away
the power of families in making educational decisions.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Federal control is achieved by the state
'voluntarily' surrendering its control,&quot; said the Rev. Sam
Freshwater of Bismarck. &quot;The state will become a partner in
child rearing. Do we want schools to raise children from the
cradle to the grave, from womb to tomb?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">North Dakota is currently participating in
Goals 2000, with the support of Gov. Ed Schafer, a Republican,
and Department of Public Instruction Superintendent Wayne
Sanstead, a Democrat.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But a group of Republican legislators have
introduced House Bill 1458, which would bar the state from
participating in Goals 2000 or in School-to-Work, a program that
gives high school students vocational training to ease the
transition to the job market.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The program is very vague,&quot; said
Rep. William Gorder, R-Grafton, the main sponsor. &quot;Trying to
understand it is like trying to grab a cloud.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The House Education Committee along with the
Education Division of House Appropriations on Wednesday held a
two-hour hearing on the bill. Tension at the packed meeting ran
high; two highway patrol officers were posted near the door,
almost unheard of in legislative hearings.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Supporters of Goals 2000 say that opponents
have a basic misunderstanding of the program. Local school
districts are under no obligation to participate in any
initiatives offered under Goals 2000; instead, the stated aim is
simply to offer incentives for educational excellence.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Rep. Kathy Hawken, R-Fargo, is a member of the
Fargo School Board. She also served as a member of the
coordinating team that applied for Cass County's Goals 2000
grant, which if accepted could bring up to $200,000 into the
county's school districts.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We came up with a plan, and not one time
during the entire process did we hear from anyone at the state or
federal level as to what we should do,&quot; Hawken said.
&quot;The input we got was local, that's it. No one told us what
to do.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;All we want to do is make Cass County
schools better for kids.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Greg Gallagher, the Education Improvement Team
Leader at DPI, said withdrawal from Goals 2000 could have a grave
financial impact on North Dakota. He said schools could lose $35
million, and potentially much more, in federal funds over the
next two years.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Gallagher also warned that the language of the
bill is sufficiently vague that it could result in North Dakota
having to withdraw from any kind of federal education
initiatives, including any kind of standards and placement
testing, or any involvement in adult literacy programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It's a step backwards,&quot; Gallagher
said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But opponents of Goals 2000 fell back on much
stronger language in making their arguments. Several who
testified in support of the bill referred to Goals 2000 using
adjectives like &quot;godless&quot; and &quot;immoral.&quot;
William Schulh of Bismarck said the program would bring American
education standards down to third-world levels.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Currently, all 50 states participate in Goals
2000. A recent attempt by Gov. George Allen of Virginia to remove
his state from participation was turned back by that state's
Legislature.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The House committees took no action on the bill
Wednesday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Bill seeks to delay start of school
year</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Forum's Capitol Bureau<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - The school year in North
Dakota could not begin until after Labor Day under legislation
reviewed Wednesday by the House Education Committee.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">House Bill 1333 is most strongly backed by
tourism officials and proprietors around the state, who say that
having the school year start in late August, as it does in many
schools, takes a big bite out of end-of-the-summer travel.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">State Tourism Director Kevin Cramer said the
state's tourism industry loses about $1.25 million every day that
school is in session before Labor Day, with a corresponding loss
in tax collections.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The chief sponsor of the bill, Rep. Jim
Torgerson, R-Ray, said the school year could still wind up at the
end of May with a revision of vacation days.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill is opposed by school boards across the
state, including the Fargo School Board. While school officials
voiced support for a later start, they say it is a decision best
left to the local districts.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This should not come as a legislative
mandate,&quot; said Richard Ott of the North Dakota School Board
Association.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">An effort to change school calendars has been
turned back in six recent legislative sessions. Rep. RaeAnn
Kelsch, R-Mandan, said she is tired of school boards calling for
local control, but consistently failing to make any changes.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;If this bill is continuously before us,
why are people not taking the hint?&quot; Kelsch said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Supporters of marriage bill accused of
gay bashing</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - Supporters of a Senate
bill that would define marriage in North Dakota as &quot;a civil
contract between one man and one woman&quot; were accused
Wednesday of gay bashing.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The opponents of Senate Bill 2230, which was
reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the bill is
ludicruous because the North Dakota Century Code already states
that only a man and a woman can enter into a marriage.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill seeks to add teeth to that definition
so that North Dakota would not recognize gay marriages from other
states.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;(The bill) is pointlessly mean-spirited
and, if passed, will send a symbolic message that the North
Dakota legislative assembly supports discrimination against gay
and lesbian North Dakotans,&quot; said Keith Elston, executive
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of the Dakotas.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">As currently written, the North Dakota Century
Code defines marriage as a civil contract between a male and a
female. Further, it says all marriages performed in other states
that are valid under North Dakota law will be recognized here.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The proposed revision inserts additional
language into the code, essentially reaffirming that only
male-female marriages will be recognized.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Supporters of the bill say they have no
anti-gay agenda in mind. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I don't feel this is a big, big shift in
North Dakota policy,&quot; said Sen. Randel Christmann, R-Hazen,
the chief sponsor. &quot;We are clarifying the existing law that
defines marriage as a consensual union between a man and a
woman.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Rep. Sally Sandvig, D-Fargo, added, &quot;This
is not a gay-bashing bill.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Clinton Birst, director of the North Dakota
Family Alliance, said he has pushed for the bill because he knows
of &quot;militant gay groups&quot; that are looking for states
with unclear marriage laws so they can come in and legalize gay
marriages.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This could happen in North Dakota, if the
right activist judge could be found,&quot; Birst said. Birst said
he obtained this information from former gay activists who have
since joined his ranks.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">John Strand, editor of the Walsh County Record
in Grafton, spoke in opposition of the bill. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">He said it discriminates against gay people.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This is not an issue about me, a gay man,
asking you for the right to marry,&quot; Strand said. &quot;This
is an appeal to you from me that you have the compassion to reach
out and understand those who are different from you and to not
legislate laws that in any way oppress their right to human
rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Strand said he thinks the ultimate decision on
gay marriages will come from the U.S. Supreme Court. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the meantime, he said, North Dakota
legislators should not waste time and money on a law that would
face inevitable court challenges.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Kristin Kitko of Bismarck warned the members of
the committee that elected officials need to stay clearly within
their role as lawmakers.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I elected you to be my lawmakers, not
priests, not nuns, not disciples, not Christians. If this bill is
not about a religious agenda, what is it about?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Ethics bill gets chilly reception</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - An attempt by Democratic
lawmakers to draft legislative ethics laws into the North Dakota
Century Code met with a chilly reception Tuesday from Republican
legislators.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I don't think it should pass and I don't
think it will pass,&quot; said Senate Majority Leader Gary
Nelson, R-Casselton, of House Bill 1477, which would restrict
business dealings between legislators and state government, and
between legislators and lobbyists.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A group of Democrats, usually led by Senate
Minority Leader Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, has attempted over the last
few sessions to pass stronger ethics laws. Mathern is a
co-sponsor of the new bill, but deferred the role of main sponsor
to his Democratic District 11 colleague, Rep. Scot Kelsh.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I feel personally there are no guidelines
as to what is proper and what isn't,&quot; said Kelsh, a
freshman.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Kelsh said he doesn't know what is considered
allowable behavior, from accepting lobbyist gifts, to when he can
use the phone on his desk in the House chambers.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the interim between the 1995 and 1997
sessions, the Legislative Management Committee drafted a set of
House and Senate rules that set up a process for dealing with
members' indiscretions. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The ethics guidelines draw from existing laws
on such topics as conflict of interest, abuse of office and other
illegal behavior. The Management Committee, comprised of the
leaders of both houses, would act as the enforcement committee.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We put together over the interim ethics
by rule that are absolutely inclusive of everything they are
talking about,&quot; Nelson said. &quot;What's on the books now
is all that is needed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Not so, said bill supporters. They said laws
that clearly delineate proper behavior are the only method that
will prevent legislators from stepping over into unethical
behavior.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Mathern said North Dakota needs to avoid a
situation similiar to Minnesota, where the frequency of ethics
violations in the Legislature led to ethics laws that are
unnecessarily strict.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This is a bill to prevent a problem
before it happens,&quot; Kelsh said, in testimony Tuesday to the
House Finance and Taxation Committee.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Kelsh's bill would accomplish two goals: one,
if a legislator wished to participate in a business deal with a
state agency that involved an expenditure of more than $2,000,
then that legislator would have to go through a competitive
bidding process with other businesses.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The other main feature of the legislation would
prohibit &quot;honoraria&quot; - acceptance of payment or gifts
over a legislator's base salary and travel expenses. Kelsh
offered an amendment that would allow legislators to accept such
intangible things as advice or opinion from a lobbyist, or
material goods that cost less than $50.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">During the session, legislators spend most
weeknights at events sponsored and paid for by firms that have a
stake in the legislative process. Most legislators agreed that
this remains acceptable behavior.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I really think it is going to take more
than a beer or a couple of chicken wings to sway a vote in this
Legislature,&quot; said House Minority Leader Merle Boucher,
D-Rolette. But Boucher said it crosses the line if, for example,
a legislator goes on a ski trip sponsored by a lobbying group.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But a number of legislators on the committee,
and Nelson, were offended at the suggestion that they could be
bought and sold by lobbyists on any level.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I think they are misreading the character
of the North Dakota Legislature,&quot; Nelson said. &quot;I would
challenge Sen. Mathern to find me any time in his entire
legislative history where you could find the kind of problem he
is supposedly trying to fix.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>School vote stirs emotions</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - The Senate on Thursday
passed a resolution that clears the way for a statewide election
on whether North Dakota's colleges and universities should remain
in the state constitution.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Opponents of Senate Resolution 4010 fear that
removing the names, missions and locations of the state schools
from the constitution would lead to the closing of one or more of
the smaller state schools in a possible effort to cut state
spending. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The state spent almost $270 million on higher
education in the 1995-97 biennium.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The issue sparked an emotional floor debate in
the Senate.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Do we want to abandon rural North Dakota?
Because that is what 4010 is all about,&quot; said Sen. Larry
Robinson, D-Valley City. &quot;The system is part of our culture.
It is critical to the quality of life in our state.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Robinson is the foundation director for
external relations at Valley City State University.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The resolution passed by a 28-20 vote, with the
support of most of the Republican majority and a few Democrats.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The resolution now moves to the House, and if
passed it would appear on the November 1998 ballot. House
Majority Leader John Dorso, R-Fargo, said he is confident the
bill will pass in the House.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I don't have any doubt,&quot; Dorso said.
The House passed an identical resolution in 1995, but it died in
the Senate.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Board of Higher Education threw its support
behind the resolution a few hours after the Senate vote. Board
President Cynthia Kaldor of Mayville and member Jeanette Satrom
of Oriska dissented from the endorsement.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;If it passes I think it would be looked
at by the Legislature as an endorsement to close schools,&quot;
Kaldor said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Out of the state's 11 colleges and
universities, only Bismarck State College, the University of
North Dakota-Williston and UND-Devils Lake are not in the
constitution. As long as the other schools remain, they are
protected from a Legislative or Board of Higher Education
movement to shut them down.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Supporters maintain that the purpose of the
resolution is not to start closing schools. They point to the
findings of the Bush Foundation panel that recently evaluated the
North Dakota University System. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Bush panel recommended that the university
system resolve the constitutional question by putting it to a
vote of the people.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lawmakers in previous sessions dating back to
the 1980s have tried to put the question to a statewide vote, but
have always fallen short, usually in the Senate.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It's been out there like a sore thumb as
an excuse to not do other things that need to be done in the
system,&quot; Dorso said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Bush panel said the ultimate result of the
vote did not matter, but only that it needed to be put on the
table so the state could move on.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;A (yes vote) today means that we can
remove this giant stumbling block,&quot; said Sen. Dwight Cook,
R-Mandan. &quot;This will give the schools the flexibility they
need.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But opponents argued passionately against the
resolution. Schools like VCSU and Mayville State University are
top employers and civic presences in their communities.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This is not about flexibility, it's not
about money, it's about closure, the quick fix,&quot; said Sen.
Elroy Lindaas, D-Mayville. &quot;But the quick fix hardly ever
does the job.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lindaas offered two amendments to the
resolution, one to only remove the missions of the schools, the
other to remove the missions and the names but keep the locations
intact. Both failed.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Despite the heated arguments, even lukewarm
supporters of the resolution did not want to argue with giving
the final call to voters.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I cannot perceive a sound public policy
reason for standing against a public vote on this,&quot; said
Board member Paul Ebeltoft of Dickinson. &quot;Other arguments do
not stand up.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But despite his support, Ebeltoft is concerned
about the vote's outcome.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I believe there is good cause on the part
of some to be suspicious of the intent of the Legislature.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Bill would crack down on meth labs</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - North Dakota law
enforcement officials are trying to push a bill through the
Legislature to block the rising use of methamphetamines in the
state. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">House Bill 1180 would stiffen punishment for
the production, sale or use of the illegal drug.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp on Wednesday
told the House Judiciary Committee that the state is facing a
methamphetamine epidemic. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The state has a growing drug problem, and
we need to do something,&quot; Heitkamp said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill would make the use of
methamphetamines, commonly called &quot;meth,&quot; a class A
felony. Anyone found guilty of these offenses could face anywhere
from a 1-year to 20-year jail term, depending on the number of
previous offenses.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill also would appropriate $175,000 in
state money to hire two drug agents in the state Bureau of
Criminal Investigation and two forensic scientists in the state
crime laboratory.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Methamphetamines are cheap, easily-prepared
stimulants that make users paranoid, jumpy and hostile. BCI agent
Jerald Kemmet said meth highs often last up to 10 hours.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Methamphetamines are the crack of the
'90s,&quot; Kemmet said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">BCI records show that meth production and sales
have exploded in North Dakota in just the last several years.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">There were no reported cases of meth sale in
the state in 1993. There were 28 in 1994,105 in 1995 and 108 in
1996.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">U.S. Attorney John Schneider told the committee
that dealers from the southwestern United States and Mexico
target states with large uninhabited areas, like North Dakota, as
prime spots for meth laboratories. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Kemmet said he knows of a meth lab near Fargo
that was moving product about every eight hours.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Judiciary Committee on Wednesday also
considered a separate bill relating to juvenile cases tried in
adult court. Under House Bill 1306, any minor over the age of 14
who sells or uses illegal drugs would automatically undergo a
hearing to determine if they should be tried in juvenile or adult
court.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill is aimed primarily at curbing
increasing gang activity in the hopes that it will provide the
chance for stiffer incarcerations of young drug dealers.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We want to be as aggressive as we
possibly can in dealing with gangs and drug issues, which in my
mind are really the same issue,&quot; said Fargo Mayor Bruce
Furness, who testified for the bill.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Mathern seeks to curb teen chewing
tobacco use</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - Sen. Tim Mathern wants to
discourage teens from using chewing tobacco by raising state
taxes on the product.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Mathern, the Senate Democrat leader from Fargo,
on Wednesday asked the Senate Finance and Taxation Committee to
approve his bill, which would raise the excise tax on the
wholesale cost of chewing tobacco, cigars and other tobacco
products by 4 percent, to 32 cents on the dollar. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Cigarettes would not be included under the
proposed tax</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The proceeds of the tax, estimated to be about
$480,000 over a two-year period, would go into the state child
care services trust fund.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We're not just taxing for the sake of a
tax,&quot; Mathern said. &quot;It's a tax with a higher
purpose.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It is the first tax increase to be proposed in
the 1997 Legislature.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">North Dakota has an above-average rate of
tobacco use among teen-age boys. According to a survey by the
state Health Department, 24 percent of males in grades 9-12 use
smokeless tobacco. This contrasts with the national average of 20
percent.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Kathleen Mangskau, the director of the Dental
Program in the Health Department, recited for the committee the
many health risks associated with chewing: stained teeth, bad
breath, gum recession, leukoplakia and oral cancer.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Mangskau cited a 1993 study by the National
Cancer Institute that said a 10 percent increase in the cost of
cigarettes leads to a 4-percent decline in cigarette sales.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;If you really want to decrease use, you
should double the tax from 28 percent to 56 percent of the
wholesale price,&quot; Mangskau said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Mangskau's supposition met with skepticism from
the committee.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The worst thing for the majority of kid's
teeth is sugar,&quot; said Sen. Meyer Kinnoin, D-Palermo.
&quot;Maybe we should place a 56 percent tax on candy.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Mangskau shot back, &quot;candy is not
known to cause cancer.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dave Meyer, a lobbyist for North Dakota Tobacco
Wholesalers, said he does not think slightly higher prices will
curb youth tobacco use.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Taxes are higher now than 10 years ago,
but youth usage is much higher, too,&quot; Meyer said.
&quot;Price is not the problem with initial users; it's peer
pressure.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;All this bill would do is increase our
cost of doing business.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Special assessment district bill
greeted with some skepticism</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - A bill that would give
special assessment districts wider scope in taxing businesses met
with some skepticism from lawmakers Tuesday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The chief sponsor of House Bill 1432, Rep. Rick
Berg, R-Fargo, said the bill was specifically introduced to
assist downtown Fargo's proposed assessment district.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Fargo Business Improvement District (BID)
would tax businesses within the district and reinvest the
collected dollars in downtown revitalization efforts.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Fargo City Commission passed a first
reading of the plan Monday night. Some businesses and
organizations are hesitant to support the plan, fearing they
might not directly benefit from the project.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">So far such projects as business recruitment
and downtown cleanup and security have been mentioned as possible
uses of the money collected from members.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Under the House bill, special assessment
districts would be able to base their assessments on property
value instead of the strict square-footage assessments in current
law. But some lawmakers in the House Industry, Business and Labor
Committee, which reviewed the bill Tuesday, said the new
assessment method is not very well-defined in the bill language.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It leaves a wide-open, subjective
analysis that will be made by the BID,&quot; Rep. John Mahoney,
D-Center, said. &quot;There aren't any parameters here.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Mahoney said he fears improvement districts
would be able to set any assessment method they want and not have
to answer to any disgruntled district participants.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Mahoney's concerns were echoed by Pamela
Schaefer, the director of Executive Support Services at MeritCare
Health Systems in Fargo. MeritCare's main complex on north
Broadway falls within the Fargo improvement district.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Schaefer stressed that MeritCare does not
oppose the district, but does have concerns that they could take
a heavy hit when the assessments come down.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The impact on not-for-profits is not
clear,&quot; Schaefer said. The bill as currently written would
include non-profit organizations and churches in the assessment.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Rep. Al Carlson, R-Fargo, a bill co-sponsor,
said he has received numerous calls from constituents who fear
their homes will be included in the assessment district.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Curt Almlie, the director of the improvement
district, said he is fighting a number of misconceptions about
the project: first, single-family homes will be exempt from the
assessments. &quot;No question,&quot; Almlie said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Almlie also said assessments will not run wild
under the Fargo plan. It is set up so that it will not go forward
unless 30 percent of those assessed give a go-ahead.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">And that 30 percent is not
business-to-business; it's dollar for dollar, so if a large
entity like MeritCare ends up paying 30 percent of the total
collections, then it would have veto power over the entire
project.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We want to sit down with the churches,
the non-profits and those organizations and really talk about
where this is going,&quot; Almlie said. &quot;We have no
intentions of going ahead without them.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Schaefer said MeritCare is amenable to such a
discussion. &quot;We have always supported downtown economic
development,&quot; Schaefer said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Rep. Matthew Klein, R-Minot, questioned if the
bill is necessary for Fargo to go ahead with the project, because
the city operates under home rule charter.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Almlie said the bill would make the current law
cleaner and clearer and give the district a stronger mandate to
go ahead with the value assessments. It also would create the
possibility of zones within the improvement district, wherein
assessments would more closely reflect the benefits of spending.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Berg said the bill probably will come before
the House Committee again next week.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Panel clears way for $5.3 million
snow-aid bill</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - Counties facing mountains
of debt from dealing with mountains of snow would get relief
under a bill reviewed Tuesday by the Senate Appropriations
Committee.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill, sponsored by Sen. Dan Wogsland,
D-Cooperstown, would provide a one-time emergency appropriation
of $5.3 million from the general fund to cities with more than
1,000 people, and to counties.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The money would be for clearing snow from the
blizzards that have socked North Dakota over the last few weeks.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;What gives the best relief, and how do we
get the best bang for our buck?&quot; Wogsland said. &quot;It's
sending the money straight to the cities and counties, where they
need it most.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill appropriates $2.65 million for
counties and the same for cities. Of that, 30 percent would be
distributed across-the-board and 70 percent apportioned by need.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Committee members balked at such a large
unbudgeted appropriation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;What about the effect on the ending fund
balance?&quot; asked Sen. David Nething, R-Jamestown, the
committee chairman, referring to the amount of state money left
over at the end of the 1997 to 1999 spending cycle. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Wogsland said the pressing snow problems
are exactly what people expect tax dollars to be spent on.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Taxpayers pay their taxes to take care of
the needs of North Dakota,&quot; Wogsland said. &quot;I think
they want their money to go where it's needed the most right
now.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wogsland suggested that the money could be
drawn from tax revenue collections that were not predicted when
Gov. Ed Schafer drew up his executive budget.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The North Dakota National Guard is leading
snow-clearing efforts in the state. Because of the federal
disaster declaration, counties and cities are only responsible
for funding 15 percent of total snow removal costs - a figure
fast approaching $1 million, according to Guard Adjutant General
Keith Bjerke.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Counties also face the problem of paying snow
removal bills now. While the Federal Emergency Management
Association is supposed to reimburse county governments for snow
removal efforts, that money is often a long time in coming.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We are still waiting for FEMA
reimbursements from 1993,&quot; Morton County Road Superintendent
Charles Morman said. &quot;We can't wait that long.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We are basically operating blindly. We
have no idea what will be paid for and when the money will come.
But we have people we have to dig out, now.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Appropriations Committee did not take any
action on the bill Tuesday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Democrats push minimum wage plan</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - Increases in the minimum
wage in North Dakota would mirror the rise of a national
cost-of-living barometer under legislation reviewed Monday by the
House Industry, Business and Labor Committee.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The legislation's chief sponsor, Rep. Bill
Oban, D-Bismarck, said tying the minimum wage to the Consumer
Price Index would provide a more accurate reflection of the costs
a poor working family had to meet. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We cannot separate economics from
values,&quot; Oban said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But opponents of the proposed increase
structure say a fixed method of increasing the wage would be
detrimental to a free-market economy.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Every time we begin to ebb at our current
system, we move one step closer to a socialized economy,&quot;
state Labor Commissioner Craig Hagen said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The current minimum wage, both federal and
state, is $4.75 an hour. The federal wage is scheduled to
increase to $5.15 an hour on Sept. 1.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The federal minimum wage applies to any
employer in the state with yearly revenue of at least $500,000 or
more. Under current state law, the labor commissioner sets the
state minimum wage after appointing a review committee that meets
once a year to consider the state wage.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The labor commissioner is under no obligation
to match the federal wage; however, Hagen said the state minimum
wage has echoed the federal minimum wage since such laws existed.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Oban and other proponents of a
fixed-increase mechanism say that North Dakota owes its low-wage
employees a more reliable system.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;North Dakota ranks 49th in average
compensation,&quot; Oban said. &quot;North Dakotans are working
longer and harder for less.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The proposed wage bill would have the labor
commissioner adjust the minimum wage based on the Consumer Price
Index every two years, beginning in May of 1998.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Democrats also introduced a companion bill that
would eliminate the so-called &quot;tip credit,&quot; an
exemption that allows business with employees that draw tips to
pay them a minimum wage of $3.18 an hour.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">'It's nothing but a loophole to decrease
overhead costs for businesses,&quot; Rep. Elwood Thorpe, D-Minot,
said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At times, the committee hearing took on the
tenor of an ideological free-for-all, with Democrats squaring off
against Republicans on the effects of a minimum wage on the
economy.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;At what point do we raise it so high that
it no longer does a service to the economy?&quot; asked Rep. Rick
Berg, R-Fargo, the committee chairman. &quot;Why not let the free
market dictate?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Berg also voiced concern that a continually
rising minimum wage would eventually place an unhealthy grip on
the state's economy.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But David Kemnitz, the president of the North
Dakota AFL-CIO, said the bill does reflect the open market.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The CPI is a direct reflection of the
market,&quot; Kemnitz said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Democratic sponsors have all but admitted that
the bill faces little chance of passage in the
Republican-dominated Legislature. But they say they want to take
the Republicans out in the open in their opposition to minimum
wage increases.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Republicans counter that the current system
allows for sensible minimum wage increases.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I like the current system,&quot; Rep.
George Keiser, R-Bismarck, said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>North Dakota House bill would protect
health care providers</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - Any health care provider
opposed to a certain medical treatment or procedure on moral
grounds could refuse to perform the procedure, under a House bill
reviewed Monday by the Judiciary Committee.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The proposed law, known as a &quot;conscience
statute,&quot; would grant criminal and civil immunity to any
person who refuses to give treatment, or to assist, counsel or
refer, patients.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Christopher Dodson, the director of the North
Dakota Catholic Conference, said 43 other states have similar
statutes. North Dakota already has a law allowing health
professionals the right to refuse to perform abortions, or to
carry out any provisions in a living will.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This bill provides consistency for
protecting the conscience of these providers,&quot; Dodson said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dodson was unclear about just what kind of
procedures might be singled out if the law was passed. He did
offer up prescribing contraceptives, organ transplants,
artificial insemination and other reproductive technologies.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Members of the Judiciary Committee pressed for
more details than Dodson and others offering testimony could
provide. Rep. Kathy Hawken, R-Fargo, repeatedly asked for a
clearer picture of what kind of procedures were likely to be
refused.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Rep. William Kretschmar, R-Venturia, the
committee chairman, asked several witnesses how many times in the
past did health providers at North Dakota hospitals run into
problems after refusing to treat patients. No one knew.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dodson said no health providers would be able
to turn back patients in need of emergency care; he said
hospitals would have to set criteria for what qualified as an
emergency.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He also stressed that no health providers would
be able to refuse treatment to HIV or AIDS patients, on the
grounds that they may have acquired the diseases through
homosexual contact.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This statute covers the treatments, not
the diseases themselves or the individual lifestyles of
patients,&quot; Dodson said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Fargo squabble may be settled by
revising state laws</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
BISMARCK, N.D.</font><font size="4"> Two legislators are hoping
they can settle a downtown Fargo controversy in Bismarck.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sen. Tony Grindberg and Rep. Rick Berg, both
Fargo Republicans, have introduced a House bill that would give
the Fargo Business Improvement District an alternate method of
assessing downtown businesses for involvement in the downtown
revitalization project.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Current law allows businesses to be assessed on
only a square-foot basis. House bill 1432 would allow the Fargo
district, or similar districts, to make the assessment based
strictly on a property valuation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The businesses would be able to
participate in a way that is based more on their specific
worth,&quot; Grindberg says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Grindberg and Berg introduced the bill at the
request of the Business Improvement District Board of Directors. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It makes the assessments easier to
understand and compute,&quot; Fargo Mayor Bruce Furness says.
Furness says most improvement districts around the country use
this model of assessment, as opposed to the current North Dakota
model. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Fargo Business Improvement District grew
out of a downtown revitalization task force that Furness
appointed last year. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The assessed taxes that the businesses would
pay to the Improvement District would be used for projects to
spice up the quality of downtown Fargo, including such
possibilities as better cleaning crews, signs and banners, and
business recruitment efforts.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Some downtown business owners have come out
against the district, fearing that it sets an open-ended tax
assessment without a clear mission. Just this past Friday, the
Cass County Commission came out against it, arguing that they
would face a whopping assessment.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But a provision of the House bill might clear
up some of this controversy. The bill would give assessment
districts the option of setting up zones within the district,
wherein participants who see a more direct benefit from district
dollars would face a higher assessment.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;You would be more directly benefiting
from what you pay for,&quot; Grindberg says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Furness says he has heard of some opposition to
this method of assessment from business owners who think all
members of the district should have to pony up the same amount.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Another provision of the bill would force
improvement district planners to make firmer plans for what the
money could be spent on, before the assessments would be made.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;You would have to say, 'this is what we
are going to spend it on,' before the assessment is made,&quot;
Grindberg says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Regardless of the outcome of the House bill,
though, the Fargo improvement district will be able to go ahead
with its plans on some level, since Fargo operates under home
rule charter. It would simply kill the possibility of the
value-based assessment.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The current plan of the Fargo group is to go
ahead with the district as long as no more than 30 percent of the
affected businesses do not object to the assessment.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill would open up the possibility of
downtown improvement districts in other North Dakota cities.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Currently, cities in North Dakota with a
population over 10,000 that are not under home rule charter
cannot start up special assessment districts; the proposed bill
would eliminate that provision.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Several other lawmakers from larger cities have
signed on to the Grindberg-Berg bill, including Rep. Andy
Maragos, R-Minot, and Sen. Marv Mutzenberger, D-Bismarck.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill has already undergone one significant
change to make it an easier sell to lawmakers. In its original
conception, it would have allowed districts to assess churches
and non-profits that fell within the boundaries of assessment
districts.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But the bill as it will be presented this week
has had that provision removed from its language.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We took that out because there's always
going to be natural opposition to a move like that,&quot;
Grindberg says.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill will come up for a hearing this week
before the House Industry, Business and Labor Committee.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>N.D. House GOP plan keeps state jobs
flat</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - House Republicans decided
at a caucus Wednesday that the Legislature should recess this
spring without bankrolling an increase in the number of state
employees.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But House Majority Leader John Dorso, R-Fargo,
on Thursday said his caucus will support creating most of the 70
new jobs proposed in Gov. Ed Schafer's budget proposal.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">What that means is that about 70 other state
jobs have to be eliminated.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;As far as the new positions, a lot of
them are critical,&quot; Dorso said. &quot;But it's our position
that we can find other areas where they are not critical.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dorso gave no indication of where job cuts are
being considered.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Rep. Jack Dalrymple, R-Casselton, is chairman
of the House Appropriations Committee which is responsible for
the state budget. He said offsetting the new employees with
position cuts will not mean a huge amount of state savings.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It's more a matter of principle,&quot;
Dalrymple said. &quot;It's a goal.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dalrymple said he thinks the job eliminations
can be achieved without actual layoffs. He said most of the
eliminations will be achieved by not filling open positions.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;There are a lot of agencies who have one
or two unfilled positions, where they are waiting for an extra
piece of money at some point to fill it,&quot; Dalrymple said.
&quot;We're saying, just drop it altogether.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The largest number of new state jobs in the
Schafer budget is slated for Jamestown's new medium-security
prison, 43 proposed positions.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Some of the other job increases in Schafer's
budget are: 18 positions at the Workers Compensation Bureau; 14
in the attorney general's office and 13 in the Information
Services Division.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dorso said in the sessions he served between
1985 and 1993, the Legislature oversaw continual increases in the
number of state employees. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the 1995 session, Dorso's first as majority
leader, there were 57 positions cut from the state rolls.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;My preference would be to cut it
again,&quot; Dorso said. &quot;But with some of the pressures in
Corrections and other areas, it looks like we can't.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The state currently has about 11,500 employees.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dorso said the Appropriations Committee will
look through its budgeting process for agencies where a position
can be cut. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">While the current plan is to keep the number of
state employees at the current level, Dorso said if it's possible
to make a few cuts, that will be done.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;If we find something extra that can go,
it's toast,&quot; Dorso said. &quot;I think that's just good
healthy government.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At their Wednesday &quot;social caucus,&quot;
which was closed to the news media, Dorso said the House
Republicans set a number of other priorities for getting through
the budgeting process.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They endorsed Dorso's and Dalrymple's request
to pump up the ending fund balance, state money unspent at the
end of the 1997-1999 biennium, from Schafer's recommended $10
million to at least $20 million.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dorso said the caucus also decided to leave the
holdings at the Bank of North Dakota at $100 million at the end
of the biennium, not $90 million as recommended by Schafer.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dorso said the extra $10 million alone would
earn $2.6 million in interest by 1999.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The House Republican caucus, with 74 members,
is by far the largest single bloc in the Legislature. Dorso
repeatedly has said that the House Republicans should be leading
the Legislature in setting spending agendas for the state.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Lawmakers eye tighter snowmobile
restrictions</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - The North Dakota
Legislature is considering several laws that would tighten rules
for snowmobilers who use state trails.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Senate Transportation Committee reviewed
two separate bills Thursday. One would require snowmobilers
riding on the trails to have liability insurance; the other would
put more teeth into laws that penalize people who operate
snowmobiles while intoxicated.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Both bills come at the request of Snowmobile
North Dakota, a recreational group. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Some people who are on snowmobiles can
get a little crazy,&quot; said Paul Silbernagel of Bismarck, a
member of the Snowmobile N.D. board of directors. &quot;Things
can happen, and we just want to have some safety mechanisms in
place.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Silbernagel added that his group would like to
avoid a situation similar to Minnesota, which has seen a rash of
snowmobile fatalities this winter. While North Dakota has no
recorded snowmobile-related deaths, there is a history of various
injuries and accidents involved with the activity.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Senate bill 2159 would require that any
snowmobiler who drives on a public trail, or on any public
property, would have to carry a liability insurance policy to
ensure the safety of snowmobilers and bystanders, and to protect
the state from lawsuits.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The Senate bill is reasonable for
snowmobilers and provides a safety net to the state,&quot; state
Parks and Recreation Director Doug Prchal said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Parks and Recreation Department maintains
1,800 miles of snowmobile trails around the state, and currently
registers 16,000 snowmobiles for use.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jo Zschomler, state risk manager in the Office
of Management and Budget, estimated that an average liability
policy can be purchased for about $30 to $35 a year.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Senate bill 2160 would increase the power of
law enforcement officials to bust drunken snowmobilers. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I don't think we'll be actively pursuing
DUI's on snowmobiles, but we have found that having a stronger
law enforcement presence around the trails discourages
drinking,&quot; said Rhoda Greenup of Snowmobile N.D. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Operating a snowmobile while intoxicated would
be a class B misdemeanor under the bill. </font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Higher ed board reminded to pay
attention to its taxpaying customers</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - The Board of Higher
Education and the state's colleges and universities need to stop
worrying about their internal problems and worry more about their
customers, according to an independent consultant.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dennis Jones, a higher education consultant,
presented the results Wednesday of a two-month study of the
state's colleges and universities to the board and members of the
House and Senate Appropriations committees. The six-person study
panel led by Jones was funded with a Bush Foundation grant.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Details of the study have trickled out in
recent weeks, but on Wednesday Jones gave the full picture. He
said the board and campuses are not responsive enough to their
consumers, the people of North Dakota.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;You need to change the frame of reference
and demonstrate the important role the schools can play in the
lives of citizens,&quot; Jones said. &quot;Show what you can do
for the community.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jones said a good example is the current debate
over low faculty salaries. Though North Dakota ranks last in the
nation in teacher pay, Jones said when professors and
administrators complain about it, it strikes the wrong note.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jones said most college professors, despite low
salaries compared to peers in other states, still make more than
the average North Dakota taxpayer.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;What needs to be done is that the public
needs to be shown what the benefits are of compensating and
keeping good faculty,&quot; Jones said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The same communication problem tends to bog
down other campus issues, Jones said. He said the board has spent
too much time dealing with internal campus issues, and not enough
time laying out a grand vision for higher education in North
Dakota.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The governor, the Legislature and the
board should get together every two years or so, in some kind of
retreat or something, and have a very frank discussion of what
higher education should be accomplishing in North Dakota,&quot;
said Fargo Mayor Bruce Furness, a member of the Bush study panel.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Another issue brought out in the report is the
need for the university system to resolve the so-called
&quot;Constitutional issue.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Because eight of the state schools are built
directly into the constitution, there has been a feeling among
board members and legislators that none of their missions could
be significantly altered.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It has been an excuse for inaction for
too long, and it needs to be put behind the board so that it is
no longer a blockade,&quot; Jones said. Jones said the people
should be allowed to vote on whether the schools should stay or
be taken out of the constitution and treated as separate
entities.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jones added that the vote's outcome doesn't
really matter, that appropriate measures can be taken with either
result.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Putting the issue on the ballot would require
legislative action. House Majority Leader John Dorso, R-Fargo,
said he's all for it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The House has passed that so many times,
but it's died in the Senate,&quot; Dorso said. This session, a
bill to put it to the people will start in the Senate.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Read the document, senators,&quot; Dorso
said. &quot;Let the voters decide.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The panel report in many places echoes the
board's request for more flexibility in spending state dollars.
It says the board must be willing to provide more accountability
to the Legislature to deserve the flexibility.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dorso said his needs are basic: a full
accounting of where and how state money is spent on each campus.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;That's not micromanaging,&quot; Dorso
said. &quot;Just tell us! The people of North Dakota need and
deserve to know.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dorso said he doesn't define accountability in
terms of dollars, either. &quot;Id like to see some accounting of
what is being accomplished,&quot; he said. The request was echoed
in the study report.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">With such accountability, Dorso said, he would
be ready to grant the board and its campuses at least some
measure of flexibility.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I am willing to support it,&quot; Dorso
said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The board will begin to consider specific
recommendations in the coming weeks and months. &quot;This is a
terrific catalyst for beginning the process of change,&quot;
board member Paul Ebeltoft said.</font></p>
