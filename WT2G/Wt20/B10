<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; But I wonder if </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; adventism puts such a pressure on people so they do not find any </i><br>
other <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; solution than destroy their lives?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What kind of unique problems can you suggest? suicide</i><br>
<i>&gt;are not unique to the SDA faith, nor are they necessarily due to one's </i><br>
church<br>
<i>&gt;membership. </i><br>
I think there should not be these kind of problems (shame, sweeping sins <br>
under the mat, unforgiveness) in the church - we are on our way to <br>
heaven aren4t we?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; things with - because suicide does not exist among belivers!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Among the pastors that I am closely acquainted with, I have not found</i><br>
<i>&gt;such denial </i><br>
I see - you have solved all your problems! But there still exists <br>
members in the church who are not as fortunate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you believe (perhaps because you were taught) that these things save </i><br>
you,<br>
<i>&gt;that they are of primary importance; if that's all you heard as you </i><br>
grew up,<br>
<i>&gt;yes, indeed, you're life would have pressures.  The foundation is always</i><br>
<i>&gt;a personal relationship with God.  When it's impersonal, you're in </i><br>
tough shape.<br>
<i>&gt;Any Christian subculture (not unique to Adventism, I can assure you) has</i><br>
<i>&gt;pressures to conform.  So, if the "model Adventist" person is doing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"right" things on the outside but is rebellious (or at least confused) </i><br>
on<br>
<i>&gt;the inside, that can lead to mental problems.  Note especially that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;causes of depression and suicide are multitudinous.</i><br>
Now we come to the point -  how can we make our christianity real; so <br>
that it will eliminate all these causes for depression instead for <br>
increasing them!<br>
<p>
May be your finnish pastor knows me - if he has been in Finland since <br>
the 604s - if so, my greetings and God bless you.<br>

Some of our colleges attempt to offer support through their counseling <br>
centers or Social Work departments.  There's a stigma to that however.  <br>
We expect everyone to be perfect, so very few cash in on these services <br>
because that is admitting that we aren't perfect.  Another obstacle is <br>
that many counselors fear to give alternative suggestions which are not <br>
sanctioned by the church (constituents would threaten to take their <br>
funds out of the college or academy), and their jobs would be at risk.<br>
So we end up with cowardly counseling, slaves to what others say they <br>
should do.  Our pastors aren't adequately trained (and shouldn't be <br>
required to) in the indepth details of every issue.  God gives others <br>
gifts to fill that responsibility.<br>
<p>
However, because we give seminarians, a crash course in Christian <br>
ethics, just short of graduation (after we've entangled them in years <br>
of redisposing scripture to what the church has already make a <br>
conclusion on), and expect them to be competent  counselors in all <br>
issues, in addition to being on their knees in prayer for the saints, <br>
and visiting everyone, and heading all the church boards; we end up <br>
giving our children pat answers to complex issues (band-aids for <br>
ulcers).  This is a PASSIONATE issue<br>
for me because I quit two of our schools Social Work programs because <br>
of it.  I love my church,<br>
many times I'm happy with it, many times I'm angry with it.  And this <br>
love is the reason that I pray this system of denial, and <br>
"holier-than-thou-ness" find a swift death.<br>

It's nice to have a directory of addresses.  However, I think it would<br>
be nice to have information on the what people are studying.  I know a<br>
number of subscribers are in the computer/technology field.  Anyone out<br>
there working with databases, data design, etc?  I'd love to hear from<br>
you.<br>

This sounds GREAT!  Unfortunatly many of us don't have FTP access. I<br>
hope you will install a mail-server that will pass inquiries through and<br>
send them back.  There are several mail-servers available on the net.  <br>
adobe.com has one written I think, in PERL.  try mailing  archive-server@adobe.com and send a message<br>
send help<br>
there are some mail-to-FTP servers out there, I don't have the addresses<br>
handy now.  I would LOVE to be able to access the catalog.<br>
Cheers<br>

Alden Thompson.  In it he talks of the implications of our belief<br>
in thought inspiration.  I believe sometimes we as adventists give<br>
lip service to the idea of thought inspiration, but in reality when<br>
we speak about our ideas it realy is verbal inspiration.  <br>
<p>
	I may be speaking out of turn since the things that are being<br>
discussed right now is abortion and suicide.  If so please <br>
forgive me.<br>

[Inspiration is always in order to discuss around here, you need never feel
that you must wait your turn to bring up a topic.  I have read and enjoyed
Alden Thompson's book.  An earlier attempt to discuss it here never got 
off the ground.  Let's try again.  SCT]

My experience of a couple weeks ago, recovering from a corrupted list, <br>
has given me a desire to automate the process somewhat so the chance <br>
for human error will be reduced next time.  Of course the quintessential<br>
mailing list program is LISTSERV, which is used by SDA-L, but I'm <br>
not aware of a version of this that's available for a unix platform such<br>
as the ones I use.  If one were available, SDA-L would now be running <br>
out of LaSierra instead of LLUVM.<br>
<p>
Typical tasks would include adding and deleting users, managing vacations,<br>
printing out a directory automatically, (instead of manually with all <br>
the associated typos).  If anyone is aware of such a program, please let<br>
me know, otherwise it will be time to dust off the C I never yet have learned<br>
and work on one for myself.<br>

Steve<br>
<p>
I have just a few comments on your listing of Canadian Union College in<br>
"SDA Colleges on the net."  The Director of Computer Services is<br>
currently exploring several options that would permit the college to<br>
have Internet access.  This may take several months.  However, I will<br>
share the results when this is achieved.<br>
<p>
You have listed me under the heading of the college.  I should point<br>
out that my involvement in SDAnet is personal, not institutional.  <br>
However, until the college establishes an Internet link, I will be<br>
pleased to channel any messages to CaUC students, faculty, or staff.<br>
<p>
Finally, let me correct a minor matter.  While I still teach one course<br>
in the Department of Religious Studies, my primary appointment is<br>
Vice-President (Academic).<br>

In Alden Thompson's book _Inspiration_ there is a revealing section in <br>
which a book by M. Wilcox about inspiration in the 1920's is compared <br>
with what Ellen G. White herself wrote about inspiration.  Wilcox<br>
holds to a strict verbal inspiration view, while Ellen G. White did not.<br>
It's clear that after the death of Ellen G. White in the 1910's and 1920's,<br>
Seventh-day Adventism became much more fundamentalist than before, following<br>
the rise of fundamentalism in general.  These were the days of the Red Scare<br>
and the Monkey Trial, days in which G. MacReady Price rose up to attack <br>
evolution.  Unfortunately the chapters on inspiration from Selected Messages,<br>
vol I. weren't published until the 1950's, I believe.  MAybe the church<br>
wasn't ready for them.<br>
<p>
It is difficult to argue positions like this, because when one admits<br>
that a writing is not verbally inspired, it becomes more difficult to <br>
use that writing as a club against someone else.  You can never club <br>
someone into tolerance.<br>
<p>
Alden Thompson's book deals mostly with examples from the Bible.<br>
Without telling you what he says about the topic, I suggest that you <br>
turn to each of the four Gospels and read the recorded inscription<br>
on the cross.<br>
<p>
One of his major points is to be sure to not make claims for the Bible<br>
that it does not make for itself.  One of my major points is that<br>
even the claims that the Bible does make for itself should not be taken<br>
as postulates, but rather put into practice and proven.  In this,<br>
unfortunately, I differ with the Statement of Fundamental Beliefs,<br>
which takes as its starting postulate the inspiration of the Bible.<br>

[A message from Paul Johnston sent through Sharon Johnston's account<br>
and edited by me to shorten the too-long lines  SCT]<br>
<p>
Sherman Cox, you may be onto something.  There's been a vague but<br>
annoying puzzle on my mind.  You've nicely articulated it, and I'm<br>
grateful.  After reading Alden Thomson's book on inspiration, you<br>
wondered if--though we Adventists officially believe in a more general<br>
thought inspiration--we actually presuppose specific, verbal inspiration<br>
of scripture when discussing particular issues.<br>
     Our theological documents, especially statements about biblical<br>
inspiration, are models of a moderate or centrist position.  But so many<br>
of us look like, behave like, demand like, think simplistically and<br>
concretely like rightist fundamentalists.  I've long wondered why.  Your<br>
rhetorical question illuminates the discrepancy.<br>
     I guess what's scary for some people is that, the further you get<br>
away from a fundamentalist view of inspiration, the more one has to deal<br>
with interpretation.  And THAT is the human component of the<br>
communication process.  The human component, of course, is also the more<br>
variable and fallible one.<br>
     This has all sorts of fallout.  If there's room for a good deal of<br>
variability or misunderstanding in interpreting divine texts, then the<br>
reader has to be awfully humble about the hermeneutical task.  It's much<br>
easier to be dogmatic if you're a fundamentalist.  It's much easier to<br>
feel the call to expunge the errors of others if you believe there's<br>
little room for error in your interpretive process.<br>
     For a few months, our congregation here in Pittsburgh had a Bible<br>
worker assisting the pastors.  He was from the South and is one of our<br>
more fundamentalist Adventist brothers.  Sharon and I had him over for<br>
dinner.  He and I had in common our backgrounds as journalists and a<br>
love for music.  Good thing.  Because it was almost impossible for us to<br>
discuss religion.  The gulf was wide.<br>
     I tried to avoid discussing religion with him.  But there were so<br>
many burning convictions with this fellow, he couldn't keep quiet.  Yet,<br>
whatever the topic was, we kept coming to one unavoidable issue.  That<br>
was how it is that divinity and humanity interact in the reading of<br>
scripture.<br>
     He said over and over again, "Bruthuh, when ah read the Bible, it<br>
is the Word of God speaking to me.  It's not interpretion."<br>
     "But," said I, "our cultural backgrounds are different.  Our life<br>
experiences have shaped us into two distinctly different people with<br>
different needs and priorities.  We'll see things differently, including<br>
the Bible."<br>
     He countered, "The Holy Spirit anoints our eyes when we read the<br>
Word.  He..." it was a HE "...will show me what's important.  He has<br>
shown the whole church what is important.  It's there in black and<br>
white."<br>
     "No," I said, "the Spirit works on you when you read the Bible and<br>
the Spirit works on me when I read the Bible.  It's the same Spirit,<br>
isn't it?  It's the same Bible, isn't it?  But we come to varied<br>
conclusions on some questions that are important to you.  There are even<br>
differences in what we think the important questions are."  (He'd said<br>
Adventist ministers are off the mark these days because "they are<br>
preaching too much Ephesians and not enough Revelation."  I wondered if<br>
the reverse was true.)  "So," I continued, "the Holy Spirit isn't<br>
misleading one of us.  It's simply that our experiences and needs are<br>
leading us to different, ummm, interpretations."<br>
     "But then you must be wrong.  The Bible is the Word of God.  The<br>
Holy Spirit isn't going to tell you and me different things."  We were<br>
back where we'd started.<br>
     Most of the conflict between the denomination and independent<br>
Adventist organizations is similar to his and mine--but less amiable,<br>
unfortunately.  The NAD document discussed on SDAnet by David, Randell,<br>
Tony, and others is in the end less about tithe and even about<br>
ecclesiastical authority and more about the nature of inspiration and<br>
the nature of dogma.<br>
     Gilbert Bailey was less clumsy in his summary than me.  But, yeah,<br>
he caught one important theme:  tolerating diversity.  I, too, read that<br>
document as a plea for toleration.  (Get this straight--my<br>
interpretation is the right one here.)  As the son of a seminary<br>
professer, I have to tell you it's great for a change.  That used to be<br>
our theologians' plea to officialdom.<br>
     On the other hand, I can understand why people may want to tighten<br>
a few nuts and bolts doctrinally.  Because, as I've said before on this<br>
network, distinctiveness and identity are pretty much the same thing. <br>
And it's hard for an organization to grow if it has an identity crisis. <br>
We certainly do have one.<br>
     Catching up on the net's correspondence, it seems many of us are<br>
trying to identify "church," especially our church, and to suggest ways<br>
out of our quandry.<br>
     Marcus, you suggest that "these 'devisive' groups have sprung up<br>
because the church has failed to move in meeting the needs of the<br>
people."  Why should we consider something a failure if it has indeed<br>
met the needs of SOME people?  Do we Adventists have to so often assume<br>
that one church--our church--should do it all?<br>
     Bill Nickless, why does the church have to be "the true church" to<br>
merit our support?  I support Shadyside Seventh-Day Adventist Church in<br>
Pittsburgh.  I also support St. Andrew's Episcopal Church.  I support<br>
them both, not because they are true, but because they are good.  They<br>
fulfil different needs in my spiritual walk.  I like them.<br>
     Another suggested applying a number of principles from "our<br>
prophet."  For instance, we were admonished to remember that "those who<br>
are inclined to regard their individual judgement as supreme are in<br>
grave peril."  I have never met anyone who considered his or her<br>
judgement as supreme.  But--and this brings us back to the topic of<br>
inspiration--it seems one's judgment is supremely unavoidable.<br>
     I for one would hate to see SDA members adopting a Mormon-like view<br>
of leadership and unity.  It does not, as one networker suggested, "make<br>
everything simpler."  It only makes things more totalitarian and<br>
uniform.  I speak as a former resident of Salt Lake City and employee of<br>
Brigham Young University (of which I have numerous FOND memories as<br>
well).<br>
     No.  The tension of unity and diversity has been with the Church<br>
since St. Paul's day at least.  It has to remain with us as we ride the<br>
shifting paradigms of social and intellectual evolution.  Do you think<br>
our denomination can find a niche?  Survive?  Thrive?<br>
     Sorry.  That's not a rhetorical question.<br>

In the week since I put out the directory, we've gained twelve new<br>
subscriptions.  It worked so well I'm going to try it again.<br>
I would like to reach at least 200 subscriptions by the end of this year,<br>
and I think we can do it.  Those SDAnet people who wonder "What are<br>
these wierd messages marked SDA-L that I can't reply to?"  For 32 people<br>
signed up to SDA-L, this is all they get.  Most of them don't want the<br>
high traffic of SDAnet or else they would be signed up.  Some of them<br>
may not yet have heard about the weekly digest in which all messages<br>
come once a week, but they can contact me if they need to do this.<br>
<p>
<p>
The directory follows:<br>
<p>
SDA-L and SDAnet membership information as of Jan 15 1993<br>
<p>
This information is for SDA-L and SDAnet members usage only.  Misuse will<br>
not be tolerated.<br>
<p>
116 working addresses are signed up to SDAnet right now, and 32 other working<br>
addresses are signed up to SDA-L but not SDAnet.  5 are signed up to<br>
the SDAnet Digest.<br>
<p>
Any directory changes or questions about either list should go to me.<br>

I believe one thing that really needs to be done as a first step in<br>
religious discussion is to be truthfull with others and to be truthfull<br>
with ourselves.  One thing is that no matter how fundamentalist you think<br>
you are you still interpret the Bible.  I guess I should say I have yet to meet<br>
someone who takes the Bible litterally in everything it says.  When pressed most<br>
people will admit the need to interpret at least portions of the Bible.  <br>
<p>
I am reminded of the text that says women should keep silent in church.<br>
We interpret that text.  We do not take it litterally as it reads.   We<br>
should interpret that text.  We should take a lot of things into consideration<br>
when we make doctrine.  Things such as Time, place, who was the being talked to.<br>
I say all this because some of us deify our interpretations and make them<br>
the Bible.  Therefore since it is the Bible we fight all who disagree with them as <br>
heretics.  Don't miss my point I am not talking of the place of women in the<br>
church.<br>
<p>
Because we must interpret there is an even greater need for the Holy Spirit<br>
to guide us as we study Truth and the things of Truth.  <br>

I've received several requests for sources for the OnLine Bible software<br>
following my posting about it some weeks back.  I've recently located<br>
two sources:<br>
	Premium Software	1-800-723-0658<br>
		(part of their Bible Bundle, 16 disks, $24.99)<br>
	Reasonable Solutions	1-800-876-3475<br>
<p>
Make sure they have version 6.00 or higher (5.00 is ok, but you might as<br>
well have the latest).  The cost is for the diskettes.  Since it's freeware,<br>
there's nothing more to pay.  The reason it's free is that its developers<br>
and contributors are all volunteers (like the Free Software Foundation,<br>
for any of you Unix types).<br>

1 Cor 13:12, in part, says "now we see through a glass darkly, but then<br>
face to face".  To me this darkness is in part caused by our life experiences.<br>
In other words, the distortion (interpretation) of the 'truth' on the other<br>
side of the glass is subject to our life experiences.  This is why we ought<br>
to tolerate differing views.  It seems to me that the sum of differing views<br>
is a clearer picture, although not perfect, of the 'whole truth' than any<br>
single view alone.  That the SDA church with it's cultural, social and <br>
economic diversity can agree on major doctrinal points after prayerful<br>
study lends support to the truth of those doctrines.<br>
<p>
To me a dogmatic approach, by providing absolute answers, eliminates <br>
questioning that can lead to positive spiritual growth.  It also could<br>
lead to the rejection of 'new light'.<br>
<p>
I'm really enjoying the posts on inspiration.  Keep it up everyone !!!<br>
<p>
I've also enjoyed the 'biographical/autobiographical sketches' of SDAnet    <br>
subscriber's. Here's mine, and I would encourage all share their own.<br>
Maybe Steve could include them in the SDAnet directory.<br>
<p>
I'm process suppport technician at the Lake Stevens Instrument Div. of<br>
Hewlett Packard, in Everett, WA.  My major responsibility at HP is the <br>
development of hardware and software for incircuit/functional test of printed<br>
circuit assemblies.  My home church is Marysville, WA.  Lynda, my wife, and I<br>
have lived in Marysville/Lake Stevens since graduation from Walla Walla College<br>
in 1982 (BS BioMedical Electronics).  We have two children, Greg (5) and <br>
Stephanie (3).<br>

Steve,<br>
<p>
I have read more than once on this net your statement that we should not<br>
postulate that which may be proven.  In principle, this is very appealing.<br>
The system with fewer axioms, and more theorems is to be preferred.  But as<br>
a practical matter, how are we to prove (deduce, or whatever other term <br>
you choose to use) the inspiration of the Bible?  Would an acceptable<br>
method of proof be to follow all principles given in scripture and <br>
personally experience the results promised therin?  Would this be sufficient<br>
as a proof?  Is it always necessary to see the promised benefits accrue?  <br>
<p>
It seems to me that God invites us "prove" the truthfulness of his word by<br>
comparing it to our own experience.  (O taste and see that the Lord is good.)<br>
However, there are times when faith in His word will be necessary to <br>
see beyond present difficulties.  So is a proof based on experience (ours and<br>
others') enough?  Or is it even desireable to view the inspiration of<br>
scripture as a theorem (proveable) rather than as an axiom (accepted without<br>
proof).<br>
<p>
Please elaborate Steve.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
Tim Swensen<br>

I was wondering if anyone out there has any thoughts on the Adventist<br>
Health message calling us to be at the front of the conservation, <br>
anti-polution, andti-poverty movements.  I ask this because a lot of<br>
health problems stem from the envirement we live in.<br>

<i>&gt;as a proof?  Is it always necessary to see the promised benefits accrue?  </i><br>
<p>
I think you have hit on something here, Tim.  Surely this is a sufficient<br>
condition but maybe it is not necessary.  I would not suggest that <br>
because some have tried this and failed, that God's word is not true.<br>
However, there are many in the world who would say this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It seems to me that God invites us "prove" the truthfulness of his word by</i><br>
<i>&gt;comparing it to our own experience.  (O taste and see that the Lord is good.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;However, there are times when faith in His word will be necessary to </i><br>
<i>&gt;see beyond present difficulties.  So is a proof based on experience (ours and</i><br>
<i>&gt;others') enough?  Or is it even desireable to view the inspiration of</i><br>
<i>&gt;scripture as a theorem (proveable) rather than as an axiom (accepted without</i><br>
<i>&gt;proof).</i><br>
<p>
I agree that sometimes faith is necessary.  I believe, however, that faith<br>
is built up by just such a procedure of tasting and seeing.  We trust God's<br>
word in those things which we cannot verify because we have proven it to <br>
be effective in those areas which we can test it out.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, the act of proving God's Word itself requires faith.  God<br>
does not say "I will show you all the evidence you need to believe."<br>
The postulate of inspiration of the Word must be replaced with the <br>
postulate "He that cometh  to God must believe that He is, and that He<br>
is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him."<br>
<p>
In short faith in the Bible as God's Word can be gained by experiential<br>
proof, but experiential proof is available only to those who have faith <br>
in God.<br>
<p>
On a related note, another postulate we often make when studying the <br>
Bible is assuming that the whole structure of Western logic holds true <br>
lock, stock, and barrel.  Really there's no reason why it should.<br>
After all, Christ's call "Blessed are those who have not seen, and yet<br>
believed" is essentially a call to circular reasoning.<br>

One minor correction on the directory ... I work as a programmer/analyst in <br>
the Southeastern Conference administration/treasury departments, and my <br>
only connection with "communications" is that I handle the techie side of <br>
the PBX.  My major responsibility is software maintenance and development <br>
for conference/school accounting, which we in turn share with other <br>
institutions in the Pacific Union.<br>
My connection with SDAnet is personal rather than institutional.<br>
Southeastern conference is looking for replacement(s) for communications <br>
director and ministerial director (a combined job description is being <br>
seriously considered). I don't know if this is appropriate for SDAnet, but <br>
interested parties should contact our Human Resources department.<br>
I have appreciated the words on inspiration and faith from the many <br>
postings I have read. It seems that the biggest fundamenalist fallacy is <br>
that of (verbal) inspiration, and that in turn is their biggest stumbling <br>
block to faith and grace. Unfortunately "they" are too often "us." <br>

One of the more astonishing discoveries of 20th century mathematics<br>
was made by Kurt Godel in the 1950's (I think):  any axiomatic<br>
system complex enough to generate logical statements comparable<br>
in complexity to arithmetic is also incapable of answering every<br>
properly posed question in that system.  In other words, axiomatic<br>
systems are incomplete once they get powerful enough to ask<br>
interesting questions.  What that means is that there are some<br>
interesting questions for which no clear answer is possible.  <br>
<p>
I have a hunch that this fundamental limitation to axiomatic<br>
thinking is one reason why any attempt to "prove" God's<br>
existence or reliability invariably leads to circular reasoning<br>
or other types of failures.  In some sense, truth is larger than<br>
deduction.  Reality is bigger than objective science can know.<br>
<p>
Godel proved that we can never answer all our questions using<br>
logic alone.  That makes me nervous, because as a mathematician<br>
I view the vast majority of people I know as profoundly<br>
illogical and therefore unpredictable.  Of course, I'm the same<br>
way myself even if I don't like admitting it.<br>
<p>
So, I believe that logic and proof are helpful but not sufficient<br>
guides in life.  Sometimes, subjective reality is more compelling<br>
and more satisfying.  It seems to me that God is especially<br>
interested in that part of our being.<br>

My impression of discussions of this topic by Adventist<br>
intellectuals, is that supposed minor discrepancies in the<br>
Bible are brought out in order to argue against verbal<br>
inspiration.  However, in reality what happens is that<br>
this causes many to lose their confidence in the Bible<br>
altogether.  There is a great body of apologetic literature<br>
about the Bible that has grown up over the centuries and<br>
it would be very easy for these writers to include some if<br>
it to increase people's confidence in the Bible.  Today<br>
with the Dead Sea Scrolls and discoveries in archaeology<br>
we have some additional confirmations.  So I'm disturbed<br>
at the frequent failure to include such faith-building<br>
material.<br>
<p>
I would also like to recommend that people study how the<br>
Old Testament and New Testament writers, and Jesus,<br>
regarded and used Scripture.  We should use it in a way<br>
similar to the way they used it.  I submit that if one<br>
compares the way that modern intellectuals use the Scriptures<br>
with the way in which the Bible writers did, one will find<br>
a great discrepancy.<br>

[A message from David Plaisted  (plaisted@cs.unc.edu)]<br>
Here's a natural remedy that a friend of mine in the church has<br>
mentioned to me several times.  She and two or three others<br>
have used it repeatedly with success.  It's an old Indian<br>
remedy for skin cancer, sold to a white settler by an Indian<br>
for $25.00 several generations ago and then passed down.<br>
<p>
Oxalis is a common weed.  Grind it up, get the juice, set it<br>
in the sun to dry.  Make a powder out of it.  Put this on<br>
the skin, and keep it moist.  Use a cloth or vaseline to keep<br>
it in place.  The skin will swell where cancer may be present,<br>
and the cancerous growths will loosen and come out, pretty<br>
much in their original shape.<br>
<p>
This lady has used this on her husband a number of times;  both<br>
are good friends of mine.  It was also used on another lady in<br>
my former SDA church with success.  Supposedly someone at Duke<br>
knows about it (the medical school) but they have not<br>
investigated it.  Of course, I'm not recommending that you n ot<br>
see your doctor.<br>
<p>
	Dave Plaisted<br>
<p>
[This begs several questions:  First, how are we to recognize the <br>
so-called common weed called Oxalis (esp. under three feet of snow).<br>
Second, how are we to know if we have a skin cancer to which it <br>
ought to be applied.  There are others, but I will ask them in <br>
a post of my own.  SCT]<br>

I know it is a mistake to judge a movement by those who misapply it.<br>
I know that herbal remedies come well recommended by Ellen G. White<br>
and others, and the best way to find out where they were recommended would<br>
be to state that this was not the case and let everyone else dig.<br>
(My library was trapped in Pittsburgh when I moved to the Chicago area <br>
recently.)   Nevertheless I cannot resist commenting on the philosophy<br>
of herbalism.<br>
<p>
While still at Andrews University I got involved in helping my boss do <br>
a desktop publishing project for a friend of his.  The book was "The <br>
Gospel Of Health" and was written by a woman who claimed to have an M.S.<br>
in nutrition.  (After reading the book, how she got it is a mystery to me.)<br>
Prominent in the book was a large section on herbal remedies, including<br>
some herbs that are actually poisonous and that Mrs. White wrote against.<br>
The author told me that she had gotten this information from another book.<br>
(her book was devoid of footnotes of any sort.)  <br>
<p>
When I go to my local branch of Apple Valley "Natural" Foods, I see a whole<br>
wall of pill bottles that purport to be "natural" remedies that will help<br>
me live more naturally.  From time to time they send me a newsletter <br>
touting the virtues of same.  A friend of mine got into the "Sunrider Foods"<br>
business recently.  These people convinced him that "whole foods" are the <br>
best kind to eat and then proceeded to sell him a set of pills with five <br>
different whole foods ground up into them.<br>
<p>
Wasn't the whole idea of the health message to have simplicity before<br>
anything else?  Some of the very herbs now being touted as "natural"<br>
were the drugs that Ellen White wrote against in her time.  When an <br>
institution of the church (which Apple Valley Market is) sends me a<br>
newsletter touting various hom(l)eopathic remedies, it makes me wonder<br>
how far we have turned from the original ideas.<br>
<p>
But there is two far more important questions which these experiences <br>
bring up, and they are related:<br>
<p>
(1) Does the church at large have a responsibility to reach out to the <br>
far-right herbalistic fringe and keep them from hurting or killing themselves<br>
with herbalism and other excesses of a misunderstood health message?<br>
<p>
(2) Are SDA's more gullible than the population at large?  I can think of <br>
at least ten people in my local congregation, who upon reading the "Oxalis"<br>
article earlier today, would go out and look for some oxalis right away, <br>
think up a supposed skin cancer on which to use it, and claim a<br>
remarkable cure.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that ones view of inspiration and ones gullibility are <br>
directly correlated.  I should clarify that I am not attacking methods<br>
of interpretation such as are used within the Bible.  I am attacking<br>
creeping inspiration, in which other inspired writings are used to <br>
bolster ones own unrelated argument.  This particular theological fallacy<br>
has not cropped up on the net recently.<br>
<p>
Perhaps it is easier for a camel to go through the needle's eye than for <br>
a scientist to believe.  It's just natural for a scientist to wonder about<br>
clinical trials, control studies, etc.  As an SDA scientist, I must also<br>
consider that these people who applied the oxalis to their "cancers" were<br>
devout people who may have been healed through prayer.  <br>
<p>
Given my biases, I've tried to be as fair as I can.  No personal offense <br>
is intended.  Now let's hear what you think.<br>

Sherman Cox asked if the Adventist health message does or should lead to <br>
more of a concern for the environment, since many health problems are<br>
caused by the environment.  It seemed to me that this was the idea that the <br>
statement on "Caring For God's Creation" (posted by me last week) was trying<br>
to convey, albeit in a rather roundabout and clumsy way.<br>
<p>
Some areas that I can think of right off:<br>
<p>
(1)  Vegetarianism is good for the environment because less land is put into<br>
grazing cattle and raising food for animals.  This can also help to alleviate<br>
world hunger.<br>
<p>
(2)  The policy against smoking helps to clean up the indoor and outdoor<br>
air and reduce deaths from secondhand smoke.<br>
<p>
Can people think of others?<br>

I think vegetarianism increases pollution becuase of all the pesticides you have <br>
to spray in the fields. Farming spoils jungles. I think an ordinary carrots is<br>
<p>
as unhealthful today than a beaf.<br>
<p>
I do not think we can do anything, but ask God to take us away from this<br>
misery planet!<br>

The other day at work a coworker of mine gave me a copy of a herbal book<br>
to look at because we have common interests in healthful living. It was<br>
entitled, "the Natural Pharmacy".  The book was published by Collier<br>
Books which I believe is a good name.  However, as I looked through the<br>
book, the concept of the Egyptian Papyrus (sp ?) came to my mind.  This<br>
book has all different sources included in it such as American Indian<br>
and others which I presently can not remember.  Anyway, I was thinking<br>
to myself that who knows what really works here.  And it made me think<br>
that we as Americans are falling into a pit of vipers if we follow<br>
untested herbal remedies such as these.  I saw no footnotes in the book<br>
substantiating the proposed cures.  This causes in me mixed feelings. <br>
I so much would like to see natural remedies being used, but we need to<br>
have some good research behind these herbal cures.  The pharmacutical<br>
industry probably has tested many of these herbs, but would be<br>
unwilling to reveal their successful results (if any) because they<br>
would be losing potential sales.  Consequently, my proposed solution<br>
would be for some SDA institution such as LLU to establish a program to<br>
test these herbs and publish a book on herbal remedies that has<br>
scientific research behind it.  Maybe a book like this exists already.<br>
 Do you know if that is the case anyone?  Is LLU doing any research on<br>
herbal remedies?  Has anyone seen a book on herbal remedies that has<br>
phamacutical (FDA type) testing behind it?<br>

Has anyone asked ftp site for OnLine Bible?<br>
You can get it also from wuarchive.wustl.edu (directory /doc/bible)<br>

This one is MSDOS program (but I don't know anything about Unix versions.)<br>

<p>
It is not necessary to look to the health message to find reasons to car<br>
for the environment.  Right at creation, we are told that we are to<br>
"rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the<br>
livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move<br>
along the ground".  (Gen 1:26, NIV)<br>
<p>
I take this to mean stewardship, not the exploitative interpretation<br>
that has historically been applied by some christians.  e.g, it has<br>
been reasoned that, as the earth will be burned up one day, we don't<br>
need to be too concerned for its long-term survival, so we may as well<br>
use it as we see fit, since it has been given to us.  But it has not<br>
been given to us, though we have control over it:  "The earth is the<br>
Lord's, and everything in it" (Ps 24:1).  And if we need any more<br>
incentive to look after the earth, we need only note that God will<br>
"destroy those that destroy the earth" (Rev 11:18).<br>

Another difficulty associated with the view of word inspiration of the<br>
scriptures is that very few can actually read the scriptures as they were<br>
originally written.  During the translations process, the best English<br>
equivalent had to be used, which many times clumsiliy expresses what was<br>
so clear in the original tongue.<br>
<p>
If English-speaking Christians belief in literally word-inspiration, they<br>
must accept that all involved in the translation process were prophets of<br>
God or did their their translation under direct guidance of the Holy Spirit.<br>
I don't think many would actually go that far in expressing that belief.<br>
Yet, they still insist on word inspiration rather than thought inspiration.<br>

I would bet that what you are extracting from Oxalis is oxalic acid.<br>
Often chemicals were named for thier source.  If that is the case, oxalic<br>
acid is semi-toxic. (just nibble on a Jack-in-the-pulpit root to find out<br>
Actually DONT!  it will blister and burn your tongue.)<br>

Hello.  It is interesting to see people talking of Alden Thompson's book<br>
on Iinspiration.  I have read the last few messages seeing if people might<br>
mention the publication from the SDA theological Society called Issues in<br>
Revalation and Inspiration (or is it Insp. and Reval.?).  No one seems to<br>
have mentioned it.  It was interesting to read this work of several<br>
authors after having read Thompson's book.  The piece was basically a<br>
critique of Thompson's ideas.  Although I felt at times that the authors<br>
seemed to question Thompson' the man and not his work.  Anyway the<br>
critique caused me to calm down the warm rception that I once had for<br>
Thompson's book.  I believe Thompson has brought up several interesting<br>
questions, but I felt that in some ways his treatment was lacking.  One<br>
thing I felt that he should have discussed was what the Bible says about<br>
itself in regards to inspiration.  I donot just mean the verse from Peter<br>
and the verse from Timothy.  I am refering to something he touched on only<br>
a little when he mentioned Jeremiah's feeling of fire within.  My response<br>
to Thompson's work would be one of motivation to further study this issue<br>
and the "difficulties" of the Bible text.  One way to study it is to look<br>
at what the BBible says of itself and what statements E.G. White has to<br>
say besides thouse mentioned in Thompson's book.  I would also echo Dave<br>
Plaisted's mention of the apologetical works of Christian in the past<br>
which have dealt with apparent Bible difficulties.  I believe that some of<br>
their explanations may be a worthwhile comparison to those offered by<br>
Thompson.  Ian. <br>

Two environmental issues I can think of are drug/alcohol abuse and social gangs.\<br>
Although view primarily as social issues rather than environmental, the empty<br>
alcohol containers, dirty needles and other drug paraphenalia are environmental<br>
hazards and pollute the earth.  Gangs are the primary destroyers of inner city<br>
buildings with graffiti, gang warfare, etc.<br>

Once again I feel I must appoligize for brigning up many topics, but<br>
I would like to hear some peoples views on wheter abortion is a question<br>
of Religious Liberty.  I believe this is an important question to lovers of<br>
Religious Liberty like SDAs.  I have heard things on both sides. <br>

Recently I have been involved in a discussion on the talk.religion.misc<br>
b-board regarding the 70 weeks prophecy of Daniel 9:24-27, and it <br>
seems that I've managed to get myself in over my head.  I'm arguing<br>
for the position that the 70th week followed immediately the other 69,<br>
based on verse 27<br>
"And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week, but in the <br>
midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblations to cease..."<br>
<p>
SDA's have traditionally interpreted this as referring to the crucifixion<br>
in the middle of the 70th week.  I have now been faced with the argument<br>
on the net (which is echoed by many Catholic and Dispensationalist<br>
theologians alike) that he who is confirming the covenant is the same as<br>
the<br>
prince who is to come and destroy the city in verse 26.  They claim the <br>
rules of Hebrew grammar indicate this.<br>
<p>
Now, I know nothing about the rules of Hebrew grammar, nor could I <br>
even tell you if this chapter of Daniel is written in Hebrew or Aramaic.<br>
But any insight or arguments against extending the 70th week far into <br>
the future would be helpful, as well as any arguments against using<br>
a 360-day year to calculate the prophetic years.<br>

One could consider many principles for dealing with the issue of<br>
inspiration.  I would like to offer four that I consider<br>
important, along with a few remarks about each.<br>
<p>
1. The determination of the inspiration of a text is a matter of<br>
faith and not empirical evidence.<br>
<p>
If that text is the Bible, one can advance numerous pieces of<br>
evidence in support of its apparent supernatural origin. <br>
However, for each type of evidence, e.g., fulfillment of prophecy<br>
and accuracy of historical portrayal, one can present counter<br>
evidence, e.g., unfulfilled prophecies (escaping into conditional<br>
prophecy is a copout) and historical contradictions and conflicts<br>
with archaeology.<br>
<p>
One comes to believe the Bible to be inspired by a personal faith<br>
through recognizing its spiritual usefulness and significance and<br>
by accepting its self-testimony.  It is also important to<br>
acknowledge the faith of the community of believers over time. <br>
This is exhibited at various levels, including acceptance by<br>
family and colleagues and proclamation by the church.<br>
<p>
2. There is a difference between accepting a text as inspired and<br>
investigating the characteristics of that inspiration.<br>
<p>
While the former is a matter of faith, the latter is a process of<br>
discovery.  In this context, investigation is not carried on to<br>
determine the inspiration of the text, but to uncover the way<br>
such inspiration works and how it behaves.  It is a process that<br>
should have no restrictions and no predeterminations.<br>
<p>
3. One should consider all the evidence, even the seemingly<br>
disturbing data, and work towards a theory or theology of<br>
inspiration that will account for all of it.<br>
<p>
It is important to read the entire Bible when attempting to<br>
understand how inspiration works.  Along side the marvellous<br>
portrayal of the gospel and much that is historically sound, the<br>
Bible contains some inaccuracies, contradictions, ethically<br>
disturbing advice, unscientific observations, and culturally<br>
conditioned assumptions and injunctions.  Any view of inspiration<br>
that is true to the actual contents of the text must take note of<br>
and account for all of this.<br>
<p>
4. One should be inductive rather than deductive in drawing<br>
conclusions about the characteristics of inspirations.<br>
<p>
In examining the characteristics of inspiration, one should not<br>
decide in advance what is acceptable and unacceptable.  In<br>
dealing with this issue, there is little or no value in<br>
superimposing upon the Bible a theory of inspiration developed<br>
outside the crucible of actual observation of the biblical data. <br>
One cannot afford to develop a theory of inspiration by piously<br>
reflecting on how one thinks that God would or should conduct the<br>
process of inspiring the biblical writers and by trying to fit<br>
the biblical data into such a theory.  Only the reverse will be<br>
productive.  One must let the theory or theology arise from the<br>
observation of the data and a reflection on its characteristics.<br>

Hi Steve,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Recently I have been involved in a discussion on the talk.religion.misc</i><br>
<i>&gt; b-board regarding the 70 weeks prophecy of Daniel 9:24-27, and it </i><br>
<i>&gt; seems that I've managed to get myself in over my head.  I'm arguing</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the position that the 70th week followed immediately the other 69,</i><br>
<i>&gt; based on verse 27</i><br>
<i>&gt; "And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week, but in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblations to cease..."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
I have discussed this in the past with various Jews. The problem with the<br>
evangelical interpretation is that it is completey arbitrary with regard<br>
to the interpretation itself. i.e. if it fells like a good fit then it must be.<br>
<p>
All the Jews who have heard the Evan.  interpretation have shot it to pieces<br>
in seconds because of this reason. The SDA interpretation is consitent and<br>
systematic and the Jews have been unable to negate it. (that doesn't mean they<br>
accept it necessarily though) <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; SDA's have traditionally interpreted this as referring to the crucifixion</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the middle of the 70th week.  I have now been faced with the argument</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the net (which is echoed by many Catholic and Dispensationalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; theologians alike) that he who is confirming the covenant is the same as</i><br>
<i>&gt; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; prince who is to come and destroy the city in verse 26.  They claim the </i><br>
<i>&gt; rules of Hebrew grammar indicate this.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
This is bunkum because it is not the prince but "the people of the prince" who <br>
come and destroy the city in verse 26. The rules of Hebrew grammar have nothing to do with it. The prince does not destroy the city at all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, I know nothing about the rules of Hebrew grammar, nor could I </i><br>
<i>&gt; even tell you if this chapter of Daniel is written in Hebrew or Aramaic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But any insight or arguments against extending the 70th week far into </i><br>
<i>&gt; the future would be helpful, as well as any arguments against using</i><br>
<i>&gt; a 360-day year to calculate the prophetic years.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
This would destroy the concept of the 70 weeks and that they were given to<br>
the Jewish nation as a time of probation.<br>
<p>
<p>
The following 4 rules must always be obeyed in prophetic interpretation<br>
<p>
1) the interpretation must not contradict or violate any other portion of the scritpures<br>
2) any symbol must only be interpreted as suggested directy by the scripture itself(eg day=year)<br>
3) The symbolic nature of a passage is determined by <br>
		a) direct textual evidence<br>
		b) historical evidence of non literal fulfilment<br>
4) the application of symbolism must be consistent, systematic and coherent.<br>
						<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Well here is one of my postings on this matter to some Jews :<br>
I hope it helps<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
The Hebrew for "seventy weeks" is shabuim shibim. The word shibim is seventy,<br>
but the word shabuim is understood by Hebrew scholars to mean "a period of<br>
seven years." All devout orthodox commentators translate this word shabuim,<br>
- shmitoth. A Shmitah is "a period of seven years." While the English <br>
translations of the Hebrew Old Testament by Jewish scholars render the<br>
word shabuim shibim as "seventy weeks", it is clear that these weeks are<br>
prophetic rather than weeks of seven literal days." (see Num 14:34; Eze 4:6)<br>
Rabbi Isaac Leeser, who translated the Old Testament into English,<br>
is in accord with this prophetic interpretation of shabuim shibim. He says:<br>
"Ancient Jewish writers thought that the second temple stood four hundred<br>
and twenty years, which, with the seventy years of Babylonian captivity,<br>
make four hundred and ninty years." (Note 47, Lesser's comments on his<br>
Old Testament translation.) The comment of this famous rabbi on these two<br>
Hebrew words is agreed to by Hebrew scholars. These words of Lesser indicate<br>
that Jewish writers believe the year day method to be the correct way to<br>
reckon the seventy weeks, but they failed to take note of the angel's words<br>
that the period "to Messiah the Prince" is to be reckoned "from the going<br>
forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem." Dan 9:25.<br>
The commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem went forth in 457 BC<br>
and at that time began the seventy weeks.<br>

Several people have suggested to me privately that I should read the book<br>
"God Cares" by Mervyn Maxwell, which speaks to the issue I raised about <br>
Daniel 9:24-27 this morning.  I am aware that this book is one of several <br>
good books on the topic.  Unfortunately, I don't have these books,<br>
nor do I have access to a library where they are, nor do I have money or time<br>
to buy them at my friendly local A.B.C. which closes at 5PM every night.<br>
<p>
So could someone be a friend and encapsulate Maxwell's argument on the <br>
question of why the seventieth week must follow the other 69?  I'd be <br>
ever so obliged.  <br>

<i>&gt;I think vegatarianism......etc.</i><br>
Come on now, just what do you think they feed beef?  More grain and corn is<br>
used to feed animals than to feed humans.  Those crops are heavily sprayed.<br>
My dad lives up in east texas.  There is a chicken farmer that is going]<br>
out of business.  He was running 3 brooder houses, with 18,000 chickens per<br>
brooder house.  He was turning out a crop of fryers for Tyson every 9 weeks.<br>
When he went out of business, he had the waste (18 inches or so in the<br>
bottom of each barn. (These suckers are about 40 feet wide, and 90 feet long,)<br>
tested.  One breeder shed's refuse (dropped feed, and chicken manure) tested<br>
out as being suitable for inclusion in CATTLE FEED, so he sold all of the<br>
waste, feathers, droppings, dropped food and all to a firm that makes feed<br>
for cattle for feedlots.  They mix it into the cattle food.  And you're<br>
going to EAT the cattle!!???  He is currently selling the rest at 10.00 per<br>
pickup load for fertilizer.<br>
<p>
This is an absolutely true story.  My dad bought a bunch of the manure from<br>
him, and got to talking with the man.<br>
<p>
The fact of the matter, is that there is a about a 90 percent waste in<br>
conversion of grains to meat.  That is, it takes 10 lbs of grain to produce<br>
1 lb of beef.  This means that you could grow 10 times the amount of grain<br>
and other food stuffs per acre, than you can beef or other meat.  This does<br>
not take into account the some 36,000 gallons of water it takes to bring<br>
a steer to butchering size.<br>
<p>
The economics don't make sense.<br>
Cheers<br>

There is a standard book, but I don't remember the name of it<br>
something with "Pharmcopiea   " in the title.<br>
<p>
Most herbal remidies are subtle in thier effect, but one that I have<br>
recently run across up in the east texas woods, (used by the country<br>
folk for tooth-ache) is anything but subtle.  Chewing the leaves, bark<br>
or fruits of the Northern Prickly Ash, produces a profound tingling of the<br>
toung and lips, followed by a rather deep anesthesia.  they say the leaves<br>
are best, but when I encountered it, it was in the form of bark.  I have<br>
used it with much success for canker sores etc.  Does a real good job<br>
of numbing mouth tissues, to the point where you can bite your tounge or<br>
burn it without realizing it.  It works well for a burned tounge as well.<br>
We seem to be digressing here.....<br>
Cheers<br>

I'm reminded of the time when my 4th grade teacher in an Adventist school<br>
said that if we had a stack of Bibles of various translations, we should<br>
always make sure that the King James Version was on top!  Then below <br>
all of the Bibles should come any Ellen White books, then any other books.<br>
<p>
The Bible curriculum in the lower grades gave the definite hint, although <br>
it never said so in so many words, that the translators of the Septuagint<br>
as well as those of the King James Version were inspired.<br>
<p>
I'm sure there is some feeling from those who are used to explaining<br>
the doctrines with the KJV that the doctrines are not as clear in the newer<br>
versions.  But really there isn't much difference between new and old versions.<br>
<p>
Those people who have to work from an Italian version have a harder time <br>
of it than any modern English version.  From what I've been told the <br>
Italian version plays very fast and loose particularly with texts about <br>
the Sabbath.<br>

I have often wondered why certain elements of the church are so opposed<br>
to the use of the newer, more accurate translations of the bible. <br>
<p>
Could it be because the KJV supports some of the distinctive SDA doctrines<br>
well, whereas other translations may not?<br>
<p>
The main examples which come to mind are "2300 days" (KJV) versus "2300<br>
evening-mornings" or "2300 evenings and mornings" (NIV etc.), and also<br>
the passages in Hebrews 9 referring to the ministry of christ in heaven.<br>
Also the word "cleansed" in Daniel in the KJV which is used to link the<br>
verse to the day of atonement in Leviticus turns out to be different inl<br>
other translations. (Sorry I can't be more specific).<br>

In the spirit of Matt 18 and Luke 15, I wish to share my joy that my<br>
build-it-yourself house just passed final inspection this morning.<br>
I have been putting in late hours working on the house, missing time<br>
with my family, and feeling incredibly frustrated when certain<br>
plumbing fixtures refused to stop leaking no matter what I did<br>
over a period of several days.  I tho't I had come up with the final<br>
fixes yesterday, so called for final.  Last night had its share<br>
of frustrations and I still had not completed 3 things which were<br>
required for final.<br>
<p>
Having already spent too long in a small rental with a family of 4 kids<br>
and wife who was going bananas, last night I was about feeling that the Lord<br>
had forgotten us in our distress, that surely we would flunk final.<br>
But the Lord showed He's in control.  The inspector who came was the<br>
one we've developed goodwill with and he winked at the 3 problems,<br>
knowing we'll fix 'em, he said, and signed off the final.<br>
<p>
Whoopee! and Praise the Lord!  It's been a long time coming.<br>

Hi all,<br>

<i>&gt;I have often wondered why certain elements of the church are so opposed</i><br>

<p>
I would disagree with you here Tony, what evidence is there to support<br>
this claim that the newer translations are more accurate ? In fact I would<br>
argue the opposite considering that almost all of the new translations<br>
come directly from Jesuit scholars and are based on texts which belong<br>
in the same family as the Latin Vulgate. <br>
<p>
All those interested in assertaining whether or not there still is any<br>
merit in the KJV compared to the newer translations should read<br>
"Our Authorised Bible Vindicated" (by Andreason ?) some time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Could it be because the KJV supports some of the distinctive SDA doctrines</i><br>
<i>&gt;well, whereas other translations may not?</i><br>
<p>
I wonder why this would be so ? :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The main examples which come to mind are "2300 days" (KJV) versus "2300</i><br>
<i>&gt;evening-mornings" or "2300 evenings and mornings" (NIV etc.), and also</i><br>
<i>&gt;the passages in Hebrews 9 referring to the ministry of christ in heaven.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Also the word "cleansed" in Daniel in the KJV which is used to link the</i><br>
<i>&gt;verse to the day of atonement in Leviticus turns out to be different inl</i><br>
<i>&gt;other translations. (Sorry I can't be more specific).</i><br>
<p>
Not to mention entire or portions of verses deleted from the text.<br>

Hi all,<br>

<i>&gt; I was wondering if anyone out there has any thoughts on the Adventist</i><br>
<i>&gt; Health message calling us to be at the front of the conservation, </i><br>
<i>&gt; anti-polution, andti-poverty movements.  I ask this because a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; health problems stem from the envirement we live in.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Well lets see in our list of priorities as the remnant church what should<br>
be our number one priority ?<br>
<p>
1) conservation<br>
2) anti-polution<br>
3) anti-poverty<br>
4) anti-war<br>
5) anti-nuclear<br>
6) what ever you feel anti about<br>
<p>
7) proclaiming the judgment message (3 angels) and preparing the world for<br>
the advent and the end of all things. (which includes the end of war, and of <br>
poverty, and polution AND the end of the ecology.)<br>
<p>
It seems to me some of us would like to stay on this earth for a long time to <br>
come. No thanks, get me out of here and into heaven. This world is not my home,<br>
we are to be pilgrims and wanderers upon the earth, are we not ?<br>
<p>
We forget that the reason for the ecology going down the tubes and poverty<br>
(mainly due to famine and greed) is because of the curse of sin which is<br>
upon the earth which will not dissipate not matter what we do but will increase<br>
until the final day. <br>
<p>
How about instead of putting the symptoms in 1st priority we treat the cause <br>
of the disease first. No we shouldn't ignore these things but as people living<br>
in the last days shouldn't we be hastening the Lord's coming ? Or do we say<br>
"the Lord delayeth His coming all things continue..." ?<br>
<p>
You know inspiration tells us that the Lord would have come a long time ago<br>
and put an end to these things, but we as a people and individually like the <br>
Jews have been unprepared for His coming. The scripture tells us that this is <br>
reason why the Lord has delayed His coming (for over 100 years now) because He <br>
wishes none to be lost. Instead of focusing on the things of this world so much<br>
why don't we do our utmost to hasten His coming. ?<br>
<p>
That will bring the ultimate solution to these problems we see around us.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
<p>
Paul J. Writes<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  [....]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Catching up on the net's correspondence, it seems many of us are</i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to identify "church," especially our church, and to suggest ways</i><br>
<i>&gt; out of our quandry.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Marcus, you suggest that "these 'devisive' groups have sprung up</i><br>
<i>&gt; because the church has failed to move in meeting the needs of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; people."  Why should we consider something a failure if it has indeed</i><br>
<i>&gt; met the needs of SOME people?  Do we Adventists have to so often assume</i><br>
<i>&gt; that one church--our church--should do it all?</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Bill Nickless, why does the church have to be "the true church" to</i><br>
<i>&gt; merit our support?  I support Shadyside Seventh-Day Adventist Church in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Pittsburgh.  I also support St. Andrew's Episcopal Church.  I support</i><br>
<i>&gt; them both, not because they are true, but because they are good.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; fulfil different needs in my spiritual walk.  I like them.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It seems to me we may be having a little lapse in understanding of what it <br>
means to be a SDA who is called to proclaim a message of judgement to Babilon<br>
and her daughters and to call the true to "come out of her". I suggest a little<br>
reading of Rev 12 might also help.<br>
<p>
Is this what happens when we begin to belittle the inspiration of our prophets<br>
and put in place our own interpretations ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      Another suggested applying a number of principles from "our</i><br>
<i>&gt; prophet."  For instance, we were admonished to remember that "those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; are inclined to regard their individual judgement as supreme are in</i><br>
<i>&gt; grave peril."  I have never met anyone who considered his or her</i><br>
<i>&gt; judgement as supreme.  But--and this brings us back to the topic of</i><br>
<i>&gt; inspiration--it seems one's judgment is supremely unavoidable.</i><br>
<p>
This not only applies to those who consider their judgment as supreme, but to<br>
those who consider it at least on par with that of God's own messengers.<br>
To the extent that we feel qualified to ignore or modify the message according<br>
to our own likings.<br>
<p>
<p>

I think it's unfortunate that Selected Messages, Vol. 1, by E.G. White,<br>
wasn't published until 1958.  The balanced view of inspiration presented <br>
there is a must for anyone who is seriously studying the question.<br>
To a certain extent the writing in those chapters is in conflict with <br>
what the church had been teaching in the forty intervening years since<br>
the death of Ellen White, and to some extent even during her life.<br>
<p>
In the mind of Ellen White there is no tension at all between a Bible<br>
into which some historical errors have crept and a Bible which is the <br>
whole and entire Word of God.  She urges not to focus on the small details,<br>
but on the coherent whole which points to salvation.  I think we would <br>
be wise to do the same.<br>
<p>
Traditional Adventism has not been the champion of inerrancy that some other<br>
fundamentalist denominations have been.  There are evangelical works that<br>
seriously try to resolve the two stories of Peter's denial of Christ,<br>
where one gospel records one cock crow and another records two.  The<br>
composite ends up with three cock crows and six separate denials!  <br>
<p>
Resolving  paradoxes in the Bible can be a source for  spiritual growth.<br>
But it can also lead, as above, into making the Bible say what it does <br>
not say at all.<br>

Ah, but here's the trap.  The KJV wasn't good enough for Ellen G. White.<br>
 Many times in her writings she quotes from the Revised Version, which<br>
was the only other version available in her time.  <br>
<p>
In all fairness, we should say that some of the modern paraphrases of the <br>
Bible do major damage to the meaning of Romans and other books.  On the <br>
other hand, some of the newer versions, NIV for instance, do a much better<br>
job in setting forth the chronological order in Genesis 1 and 2  (some <br>
net.theologians would claim they did a hatchet job.)<br>
<p>
For myself, the KJV is still the only study Bible I own.  I have the NIV<br>
on computer, and for reading I use the New American Standard Bible and the <br>
New Revised Standard Version.<br>
<p>
Since we have many people on this net who are not blessed (or cursed)<br>
with many different translations of the Bible in their language, it would<br>
be interesting to hear how the various Adventist doctrines translate into<br>
other languages.  I know from personal experience that they translate into<br>
Afrikaans rather well.  Does every Adventist in South America learn that <br>
the two-horned beast of Revelation 13 is the United States, for instance?<br>

"the Lord delayeth His coming all things continue..." ?<br>
&lt;-------<br>
<p>
Considering the weight of inspired texts which point out that in order to<br>
be ready for the close of probation we need to have removed all sin from<br>
our lives, surely this is not a responsible attitude for the remnant to<br>
take. After all, sins of omission are still sins aren't they? Neglecting<br>
to take the proper care of our environment as directed by our Lord in<br>
the Garden of Eden shows disregard for God's commands, as well as a lack<br>
of care for our fellow man. Besides which, a damaged environment clearly<br>
affects our health, and this cannot be ignored in the light of the strong<br>
health and temperance emphasis the SDA church has historically had.<br>
<p>
Considering the fact that sin consists of physical actions performed by <br>
physical beings, the imperfect state of the environment cannot be blamed<br>
on "sin" without blaming it on "sinners". We as a human race are the ones<br>
who have ruined the environment, and we also have the option to make good<br>
choices and look after it. If we ignore this issue, and either omit to<br>
be "environmentally friendly" ourselves, or if we take actions which<br>
actively harm the environment, we are continuing the sinful practices<br>
which have caused the current situation.<br>
<p>
Lesser Christians would agree with Ruben when he points out that some of <br>
these deficiencies in our lives will only be removed when the Lord comes<br>
again, but surely this weak perspective is not promoted by His remnant<br>
people?<br>
<p>
Clearly, the members of God's remnant must accompany their preaching<br>
of the three angels' messages with a suitable attitude to environmental<br>
issues, since this is a necessary step in the process of full <br>
sanctification which we all need before translation, don't we?<br>
<p>
Even perfectionists need to be green!<br>

<i>&gt; Hi all,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I have often wondered why certain elements of the church are so opposed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to the use of the newer, more accurate translations of the bible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I would disagree with you here Tony, what evidence is there to support</i><br>
<i>&gt; this claim that the newer translations are more accurate ? In fact I would</i><br>
<i>&gt; argue the opposite considering that almost all of the new translations</i><br>
<i>&gt; come directly from Jesuit scholars and are based on texts which belong</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the same family as the Latin Vulgate.</i><br>
<p>
I think you need to substantiate your statements here.  I do not believe that<br>
"almost all of the new translations come directly from Jesuit scholars...".  I<br>
believe the NIV was put together and reviewed by scholars from many<br>
denominations, mostly protestant in origin.  There have been studies done by I<br>
believe professors at Andrews U. or at the G.C. that have found both the RSV and<br>
the NIV to be the most accurate translations of scripture, when comparing them<br>
to the original hebrew/greek.  If you want sources on this, I read it in a<br>
Review article a few years back.<br>
<p>
I will agree that not all new translations are more accurate than the KJV but<br>
the ones I mentioned above are claimed to be more accurate.  And given the fact<br>
that I have a hard time understanding the english used in the KJV, I find the<br>
NIV to be far more beneficial to my spiritual life than trying to read the KJV<br>
which only frustrates me.  What good is a Bible that frustrates the reader and<br>
hides some of its meaning through middle-ages english?  If it isn't written in a<br>
language used by proper speaking people of today in your native tongue, then you<br>
will miss something.  And of course it has to retain its accuracy to the<br>
original text.  This also doesn't negate the value obtained in trying to go back<br>
to the original and studying it on key issues to obtain a more pure form...but<br>
for everyday reading, I think that some of the newer translations have been<br>
tremendously beneficial for Bible reading and study.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; All those interested in assertaining whether or not there still is any</i><br>
<i>&gt; merit in the KJV compared to the newer translations should read</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Our Authorised Bible Vindicated" (by Andreason ?) some time.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Could it be because the KJV supports some of the distinctive SDA doctrines</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;well, whereas other translations may not?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I wonder why this would be so ? :)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The main examples which come to mind are "2300 days" (KJV) versus "2300</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;evening-mornings" or "2300 evenings and mornings" (NIV etc.), and also</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the passages in Hebrews 9 referring to the ministry of christ in heaven.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Also the word "cleansed" in Daniel in the KJV which is used to link the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;verse to the day of atonement in Leviticus turns out to be different inl</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;other translations. (Sorry I can't be more specific).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Not to mention entire or portions of verses deleted from the text.</i><br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
Tony writes :<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Considering the fact that sin consists of physical actions performed by </i><br>
<i>&gt; physical beings, the imperfect state of the environment cannot be blamed</i><br>
<i>&gt; on "sin" without blaming it on "sinners". We as a human race are the ones</i><br>
<i>&gt; who have ruined the environment, and we also have the option to make good</i><br>
<i>&gt; choices and look after it. If we ignore this issue, and either omit to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be "environmentally friendly" ourselves, or if we take actions which</i><br>
<i>&gt; actively harm the environment, we are continuing the sinful practices</i><br>
<i>&gt; which have caused the current situation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Lesser Christians would agree with Ruben when he points out that some of </i><br>
<i>&gt; these deficiencies in our lives will only be removed when the Lord comes</i><br>
<i>&gt; again, but surely this weak perspective is not promoted by His remnant</i><br>
<i>&gt; people?</i><br>
<p>
Now, now, I no way did I insinuate that SDAs should be environmentally<br>
irresponsible. In reference to my statement I think the context it was made <br>
in should not be overlooked. The context was one of which priority should come<br>
first as a people not whether we should or should not be concerned about the <br>
ecology.<br>
<p>
Of course we should make good choices with regard to taking care of nature,<br>
we are responsible for it. But let me remind you that the point I was discussing<br>
is whether we as a people should be at the *front* of various social movements.<br>
<p>
In fact I find the whole thing a little worrying. The reason is because<br>
we the SDA church should have been at the front of the health message, but<br>
due to our wilful neglect of the message, others have taken up the banners<br>
we should be carrying. To the point that the work that Gods people should<br>
have been at the front of Satan has taken over and his people -- the New Age<br>
Movement is now at the forefront. That's right go into any health food shop<br>
and look around. And you know, a lot of people are coming to the new age <br>
movement through, *our* health message. Healthy living these days is almost <br>
always associated with spiritism and the new age. How very sad for the church <br>
that we have allowed Satan to steal our secret weapon because we couldn't <br>
care less.<br>
<p>
And what's worse is that while we have allowed Satan to steal our weapons,<br>
the movement we should be in front of, we in turn are now trying to steal<br>
his weapon and the movements that his followers (spiritists) have been in front<br>
of for a long time. Really, just ten years ago a greenie = a spiritist.<br>
<p>
Whats happened ? have we switched camps or something ?<br>
<p>
As for the weak perspective and Lesser christians, We know that there will be<br>
increasing floods, and storms and earthquakes, until the very earth<br>
beneath our feet breaks up from beneath us. I can't see what that<br>
has to do with weak perspectives at all. Remeber it is the weak that allow<br>
themselves to be carried by the crowd, and do what is popular or trendy.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Clearly, the members of God's remnant must accompany their preaching</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the three angels' messages with a suitable attitude to environmental</i><br>
<i>&gt; issues, since this is a necessary step in the process of full </i><br>
<i>&gt; sanctification which we all need before translation, don't we?</i><br>
<p>
I wish the members of God's remnant *did* preach  the three angels' messages<br>
full stop. Its been years since the message was preached, <br>
<p>
Q. What was the last time you heard a historical Adventist sermon on the <br>
three angels message ?<br>
<p>
It seems to me some pastors occupy a larger segement of their time preaching <br>
about the environment than preaching the 3 angels message. lets see<br>
the 3 unpopular messages judgment, Sabbath worship/mark of the beast, <br>
and to come out and be separate from the *popular* churches.<br>
<p>
No, I'm not saying we should be ecologically irresponsible, I never have,<br>
however I do have a little difficulty regarding equating the need to be a <br>
green activist and sanctification. (if I did not missunderstand your comment)<br>
<p>

Ruben writes <br>
<i>&gt; Well lets see in our list of priorities as the remnant church what should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be our number one priority ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) conservation</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) anti-polution</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3) anti-poverty</i><br>
<i>&gt; 4) anti-war</i><br>
<i>&gt; 5) anti-nuclear</i><br>
<i>&gt; 6) what ever you feel anti about</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 7) proclaiming the judgment message (3 angels) and preparing the world for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the advent and the end of all things. (which includes the end of war, and of </i><br>
<i>&gt; poverty, and polution AND the end of the ecology.)</i><br>
<p>
Our number one priority is to preach the 3 angels messages, Does it therefore<br>
follow that we should not fight for justice in the earth as individual citizens.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; It seems to me some of us would like to stay on this earth for a long time to </i><br>
<i>&gt; come. No thanks, get me out of here and into heaven. This world is not my home,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we are to be pilgrims and wanderers upon the earth, are we not ?</i><br>
<p>
Just because one wants to make life better down here does not mean he does not<br>
care about heaven.  We are pilgrims and wanderers, but let us not make the <br>
world worse off because of our negligence while here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We forget that the reason for the ecology going down the tubes and poverty</i><br>
<i>&gt; (mainly due to famine and greed) is because of the curse of sin which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; upon the earth which will not dissipate not matter what we do but will increase</i><br>
<i>&gt; until the final day. </i><br>
<p>
We can reduce the ecology crisis at lease as it relates to us.  Just like as<br>
a church we rreduce hunger a little by our community outreach.  It won't do<br>
it all, but I am sure those people being fed are happy we do not give up on<br>
fighting hunger just because we think that we cannot win the battle with hunger.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How about instead of putting the symptoms in 1st priority we treat the cause </i><br>
<i>&gt; of the disease first. No we shouldn't ignore these things but as people living</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the last days shouldn't we be hastening the Lord's coming ? Or do we say</i><br>
<i>&gt; "the Lord delayeth His coming all things continue..." ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I do not know anyone who wants to put ecology or anything else above preaching<br>
the gospel as first priority.  Also we all believe we should be hastening the<br>
Lord's comming.  This is a straw man.  I am happy to hear you believe we should<br>
not ignore these things.  It bothers me that one who talks about the need of <br>
these things is attacked as one who does not look forward to the Lord's coming.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You know inspiration tells us that the Lord would have come a long time ago</i><br>
<i>&gt; and put an end to these things, but we as a people and individually like the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Jews have been unprepared for His coming. The scripture tells us that this is </i><br>
<i>&gt; reason why the Lord has delayed His coming (for over 100 years now) because He </i><br>
<i>&gt; wishes none to be lost. Instead of focusing on the things of this world so much</i><br>
<i>&gt; why don't we do our utmost to hasten His coming. ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That will bring the ultimate solution to these problems we see around us.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I look forward to the Lord's coming with you Ruben.<br>

You should be able to go to your public (or even academic) library and<br>
have Maxwell's book (or any other, for that matter) sent to you on<br>
interlibrary loan.  In some cases the library will charge you, in others<br>
not.  If the borrowing library tells us it's for an SDA, we will waive<br>
our ILL charge.  We do have the book, but I'm not sure whether it's in<br>
circulation.  I would note that Maxwell is a church historian, not a<br>
theologian, and his book is seen by many SDA theologians as more of an<br>
apologetic than good theology.  However, as a librarian, I feel that you<br>
should be able to borrow a copy of virtually anything, so give it a try<br>
(if you're interested).<br>
<p>
I plan to reply to some of the suggestions about our OPAC made on the<br>
net after I have a few more answers.<br>
<p>
Are you living in Chicago now?<br>

Maybe its time for a reality check here.<br>
<p>
My observations indicate that the SDA church has NOT put the above issues in the<br>
order of priority as you suggest.  In fact #7 has been the #1 priority for as<br>
long as I have been in the SDA church (all my life).  What is an attempt to get<br>
SDA's to take our blinders off and realize that there is other causes to fight<br>
for is instead being shot down.<br>

<p>
Very true indeed.  But until we get off this planet, we have to live in this<br>
place and be a witness for others.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How about instead of putting the symptoms in 1st priority we treat the cause</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the disease first. No we shouldn't ignore these things but as people living</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the last days shouldn't we be hastening the Lord's coming ? Or do we say</i><br>
<i>&gt; "the Lord delayeth His coming all things continue..." ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You know inspiration tells us that the Lord would have come a long time ago</i><br>
<i>&gt; and put an end to these things, but we as a people and individually like the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Jews have been unprepared for His coming. The scripture tells us that this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason why the Lord has delayed His coming (for over 100 years now) because He</i><br>
<i>&gt; wishes none to be lost. Instead of focusing on the things of this world so</i><br>
much<br>
<i>&gt; why don't we do our utmost to hasten His coming. ?</i><br>
<p>
When Mrs. White talked about Jesus's delay, it was due to His people not being<br>
ready.  Who are His people?  Everyone on this earth.  Sometimes I think we focus<br>
on our selves abit too much in thinking about preparation for Jesus's second<br>
coming.  This is the place to start but not the place to end.<br>
<p>
How can we influence "worldly" people out there into accepting Christ into their<br>
lives if we don't give a hoot about our environment, a growing concern among<br>
many non-SDAs?  If they see us showing no concern, how likely are they to be<br>
interested in learning about our God?  Christ made us stewards of this earth,<br>
according to Genesis.  I don't believe we will be effective in reaching people<br>
(a prerequisite for preparing them for the 2nd Coming) until we can pull our<br>
heads out of the sand and show some awareness and concern for our environment.<br>
<p>
Asked another way, are we going to influence more people by being strong leaders<br>
that others can look up to because of our moral stand on issues or by hiding in<br>
the shadows as we have done in the past (just ask any non-SDA where SDA's stand<br>
on any given environmental issue...pollution, war, conservation, abortion, etc<br>
and you will see my point...they won't know)?<br>

Steve Writes:<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ah, but here's the trap.  The KJV wasn't good enough for Ellen G. White.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Many times in her writings she quotes from the Revised Version, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; was the only other version available in her time.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
ah, but you will also note that she does so very carefully. Also EGW never<br>
said that the KJV was a perfect traslation, just that it was much better<br>
than than the others. But then as a prophet I'm sure she had the discernment<br>
to know which verse was translated the best. You will note also that<br>
the KJV was definitively good enough for EGW as it was the only bible she<br>
used for her personal reading, and the majority of quotes in her writing <br>
where from the KJV.<br>
<p>
Hey, I use other versons (and languages) too sometimes when studying a <br>
particular text to get a more complete picture of the meaning the verse conveys.<br>
However on matters of scriptural authority I rely on the KJV or better still<br>
on the Greek text itself (textus receptus, not that I know Greek :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Since we have many people on this net who are not blessed (or cursed)</i><br>
<i>&gt; with many different translations of the Bible in their language, it would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be interesting to hear how the various Adventist doctrines translate into</i><br>
<i>&gt; other languages.  I know from personal experience that they translate into</i><br>
<i>&gt; Afrikaans rather well.  Does every Adventist in South America learn that </i><br>
<i>&gt; the two-horned beast of Revelation 13 is the United States, for instance?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Well in the Spanish there is no problem with Rev 13 but there is a problem <br>
with Hebrews where it says that Jesus went straight into the Most Holy place<br>
instead of correctly translating is as the holy place (sorry can't remember <br>
the reference). There are no other major problems with the Spanish Reina-Valera <br>
version (it would almost the be the equivalent to the KJV in English) as far <br>
as I know.<br>

I think that the reason Ellen White used the revised version was the<br>
more modern language.  The problem with the modern versions (in my<br>
view) is that they couple the modern language with the wrong<br>
Greek manuscripts.  It doesn't show that she supported one Greek<br>
version or the other, just that she favored modern language.  The<br>
New King James attempts to put the KJV in modern language.  Also<br>
it's not clear to me which version she used most frequently;  do<br>
you know?<br>

Re Beef and vegetarianism.<br>
<p>
Ok - you can tell lots of horror stories about chicken and beef. But my <br>
point was that you can tell the same stories about crops beeing poisoned<br>
by all kind fertilisers from swineyards (was that the right word?) and all kind kinds<br>
waste cleaning industries. But I thought of an cow (or an elk for that matter) <br>
living out in the free, and somehow I think that if you do not eat the liver <br>
etc you might eat healtier than eating leadpoisoned carrots.<br>

<i>&gt;poverty, and polution AND the end of the ecology.)</i><br>
<p>
It is possible proclaim the judgement until we are blue in the face, but<br>
if it makes no perceived difference in our lives here on earth, we are<br>
in trouble.  People are looking for solutions to their problems NOW, not<br>
at the end of time.  Sure, we can promise them an advent, but without<br>
any evidence that belief in the judgement can make an immediate<br>
difference in their lives, you are going to have a hard time convincing<br>
them that you have anything to offer.<br>
<p>
If someone shows a lack of care for the environment, polution, poverty,<br>
war, etc, it tells me that they are not particularly concerned about how<br>
their own actions affect other people.  If someone came and knocked on<br>
my door telling me how wicked I am and that I will be burned up if I<br>
don't change, after driving up in a V8 gas-guzzler, stepping over the<br>
drunk in the gutter, ignoring the homeless kid on the corner, I would<br>
seriously wonder who needs changing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It seems to me some of us would like to stay on this earth for a long time to </i><br>
<i>&gt;come. No thanks, get me out of here and into heaven. This world is not my home,</i><br>

<i>&gt;(mainly due to famine and greed) is because of the curse of sin which is</i><br>
<i>&gt;upon the earth which will not dissipate not matter what we do but will increase</i><br>
<i>&gt;until the final day. </i><br>
<p>
It may not be my home, but (at least in parts) it's a great place to<br>
visit.  You are seriously under valuing what God has created.<br>
<p>
The curse of sin arose out of man's actions ("Because thou .. hast<br>
eaten of the tree ..." Gen 3:15).   Today, it is still our actions that<br>
have the biggest destructive impact on our environment.  The parts of<br>
the earth that are least touched by man remain, IMHO, the most exciting<br>
places to visit.<br>
<p>
If sin can only increase, then I am doomed in my personal as well as<br>
communal life.  Cannot God change people and turn them away from sin?<br>
Then how can you say we cannot make a difference to other things.  For<br>
example, if poverty is due to our greed, and if I do not become less<br>
greedy, how have I gained?  Have I simply become greedy and happy,<br>
instead of greedy and unhappy?<br>
<p>
The reasons for the ``social gospel'' are the same as those for changing<br>
any other aspect of our behaviour.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How about instead of putting the symptoms in 1st priority we treat the cause </i><br>
<i>&gt;of the disease first. No we shouldn't ignore these things but as people living</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the last days shouldn't we be hastening the Lord's coming ? Or do we say</i><br>
<i>&gt;"the Lord delayeth His coming all things continue..." ?</i><br>
<p>
I don't say that the Lord has delayed his coming.  But we have no excuse<br>
for not caring about how we live.  If it was, we could say, it doesn't<br>
matter about my health, God will give me a new body one day Real Soon<br>
Now.  In the meanwhile, I'll just do whatever is most convenient for me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You know inspiration tells us that the Lord would have come a long time ago</i><br>
<i>&gt;and put an end to these things, but we as a people and individually like the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Jews have been unprepared for His coming. The scripture tells us that this is </i><br>
<i>&gt;reason why the Lord has delayed His coming (for over 100 years now) because He </i><br>
<p>
Where does the scripture tell us that the Lord has delayed his coming<br>
for over 100 years?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;wishes none to be lost. Instead of focusing on the things of this world so much</i><br>
<i>&gt;why don't we do our utmost to hasten His coming. ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
We don't necessarily have to go out and preach all things green.  The<br>
most important aspect of the social aspects of the gospel is that it is<br>
spread by DOING things, rather than SAYING things.  This contrasts<br>
rather markedly with the prophetic aspects.  We must not forget that it<br>
is possible to both do and say things simultaneously, so to be socially<br>
aware doesn't mean you have to stop whatever it is you wish to say, as<br>
long as the two do not conflict.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That will bring the ultimate solution to these problems we see around us.</i><br>
Amen.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
Bruce writes :<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think you need to substantiate your statements here.  I do not believe that</i><br>
<i>&gt;"almost all of the new translations come directly from Jesuit scholars...".  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe the NIV was put together and reviewed by scholars from many</i><br>
<i>&gt; denominations, mostly protestant in origin.  There have been studies done by I</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe professors at Andrews U.or at the G.C.that have found both the RSV and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the NIV to be the most accurate translations of scripture, when comparing them</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the original hebrew/greek.  If you want sources on this, I read it in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Review article a few years back.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Well in case you weren't aware the RSV mainly translated <br>
(or should I say the translation was "guided") by two Oxford professors<br>
Wescott and Hort. These two men *hated* the KJV with a passion and blatantly<br>
said so, it is also well known that they were very pro-Catholic which at that <br>
time was very unprotestant. I can get you the evidence if you so desire. <br>
It is also well known that Oxford had been well infiltrated by the Jesuits<br>
by that time which would well explain the leanings towards Romanism that these<br>
men shared. As for the NIV and other modern translations you will find that<br>
the Jesuit scholars contributed a significant proportion of the translation <br>
effort, and as for being reviewed by scholars from many denominations I don't <br>
find this fact very important due to the convenient ecumenical climate. That<br>
only demonstrates that they will select the translation that most fully<br>
serves their purpose of joining hands more fully with Romanism.<br>
<p>
As for the studies done by certain conference men, I don't really know of which<br>
you are refering, if you refer to their reply to the study I mentioned yesterday<br>
you will find that it was most admirably refuted. <br>
<p>
As for comparing to the original Greek (The Hebrew is not an issue) It really<br>
depends on ones bias. The reason I say this is that you will find that <br>
historically there are two distinct families of texts in the orignal languages.<br>
One family that from which the KJV is derived is from the Textus Receptus<br>
otherwise known as the received text. About 90% of all the original texts<br>
are from this family. *All* (excepting NKJV) the modern translations come from<br>
the other family of original texts of which the latin vulgate belongs. We know<br>
(EGW says so apart from other reasons) that the Latin Vulgate is full of errors.<br>
Of this other class less, they comprise less than 10% of all the manuscripts.<br>
The Siniaticus manuscript (which was found on a trash heap outside a monastery,<br>
very appropriatly I think) and the Vaticanicus (which was found amazingly in<br>
the Vatican of all places) are the most recently found and claimed to the the<br>
oldest actual texts, these belong to the Vulgate family. <br>
<p>
Scientifically, and textually the correct version is that which of which there<br>
is the bulk of evidence. However the KJV being derived from the TExtus receptus<br>
is very poorly received by the RCC for obvious reasons, one of which is because<br>
it is the very text that the Waldensians treasured and kept alive and passed <br>
down from generation to generation. It is the manuscript that God preserved<br>
through the dark ages.<br>
<p>
I can give you the entire story on the origins of the Siniaticus and the <br>
Vaticanicus manuscripts and how they originated with Constantine and Origen,<br>
with references if you really desire.<br>
<p>
As for the the New versions being more correctly translated this is only so<br>
if you beleive that the Vulgate family is the correct family of texts.<br>
<p>
Ruben. <br>

the whole body of text from the message to which they are responding.<br>
I would ask you to please keep this practice to a minimum.  Only <br>

<i>&gt; I'm sorry if you felt attacked. It was not my intention to attack you or </i><br>
<i>&gt; anybody personally. I am concerned however about a growing trend (here in </i><br>
<i>&gt; Australia at least) where the youth no longer know anything about the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Adventist message or the bible bar the superficials, and seem to think that</i><br>
<i>&gt; being and Adventist means being at the front of all the current social issues.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Something which Jesus in His day did not do at all, instead He avoided them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I must admit my exposure to Adventism is in the United States.  And most of<br>
my exposure to Adventism is in the Black Churches of the United States.  I<br>
did not consider where you were writing from.  I have heard about the situation<br>
in Australia from some "independent ministers" here.  It is interesting to learn<br>
that the Australian Adventists preach social issues above the Adventist <br>
distinctive message.   I forgot, for a minute, that we are a world<br>
church.  <br>
<p>
Actually I can remember sermons on the Sabbath, Religious Liberty, personal<br>
Health.  I also can remember references made to the State of the Dead, <br>
Spirit of Prophecy, and other adventist distinctives.  Once again I would say<br>
this is in the Black  churches of the United States.  I cannot remember a <br>
sermon on the environment, but one might conceivable say that the principles<br>
presented would cause one to be concious.<br>
<p>
The main idea is that Christianity is a lifestyle that should affect every<br>
thing you do.  Sometimes one can see an utter disregard for other  people<br>
from those who claim to be christians.  I understand you come from, by your<br>
testimony, a place where people lost an understanding of the message, so it <br>
is understandable<br>
that you would see a red flag when someone comes with the environment.<br>
<p>
We learn from exposure to others<br>

My favorite is the NEW KING JAMES. It is easy to read, and very true to<br>
the KJV (the old standard).  I think it is by far and away the best version<br>
on the market.<br>
Cheers<br>

Why should the fact that some other groups share some of our beliefs be<br>

someone shares some of our beliefs, that should make it easier to reach them.<br>
<p>
IMHO, caring for the environment is as important as caring for<br>
ourselves.  Perhaps even more important, because it is saying to other<br>
people that we care about them and don't want to harm what is just as<br>
much their environment as it is ours.  This argument applies even more<br>
strongly to the other "priorities" raised: anti-poverty, anti-war,<br>
etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Whats happened ? have we switched camps or something ?</i><br>

Maybe we are realising that we are somewhat defficient in some areas (but perhaps<br>
slipping in others ...)?<br>

Ruben's defense of the "textus receptus" of the New Testament could <br>
profit by a bit of analysis.  The early English and German translators <br>
of the Bible including Tyndale, Luther, and the translators of the KJV<br>
worked from the Greek New Testament compiled by Erasmus in the early 1500's.<br>
<p>
In the compilation of that work, Erasmus noted that 1 John 5:8 as translated<br>
in the Vulgate had an addition which did not appear in the Greek manuscripts:<br>
"For there are three that bear witness **in heaven, the Father, the Word,<br>
and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one.  And there are three that<br>
bear witness on earth**, the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these<br>
three are in agreement."<br>
<p>
The part between the asterisks evidently was added quite some time later.<br>
Erasmus did not want to include it, but the Church fathers insisted that<br>
he should.  He said that if they could even find one Greek manuscript<br>
which contained this "comma", as it has come to be known, he would include<br>
it.  A manuscript was promptly "discovered" in Ireland which has since been <br>
found to be a translation of the Latin back into Greek, and that part of the <br>
text was included in the "textus receptus", and in the King James Bible<br>
and in the New King James Bible, and in a footnote in almost every other<br>
translation.<br>
<p>
So you see there has been tampering with the "textus receptus" by the <br>
very same people Ruben accuses of tampering with the other versions.<br>
We should be careful in choosing our points of defending the Word.<br>
<p>
By the way, I don't dispute that there are many errors in the Vulgate<br>
and other Catholic versions based on it.  One of the first and prominent<br>
ones is making Genesis 3:15 refer to Mary and not to Jesus.  At the same <br>
time, we should consider that the final makeup of the New Testament was <br>
not decided until 360 AD by a Catholic church that Adventists claim was<br>
already deep into apostasy. <br>
<p>
Finally, when the Vulgate was released in the 300's AD, many of the same<br>
claims against it were made as are made against the various modern<br>
translations now.  Jerome didn't want to include the Apocrypha but was <br>
forced to do so by the church fathers because there was 300 years of<br>
tradition of having them around.  The familiar versus the more accurate<br>
is a battle that has gone on almost since the beginning.<br>

<i>&gt;From: Message Center &lt;FZC@NIHCU.BITNET&gt;</i><br>
<p>
One of the features of the Internet is the ability to connect to<br>
another location and obtain files stored at that location.  This<br>
capability is called "FTP" (for "File Transfer Protocol".)  This<br>
means that an installation can place important sources or binaries on<br>
a particular machine and then "advertise" the place where the<br>
material is stored.  Then, anyone who wants or needs this material<br>
can use FTP to request it.  There are two types of FTP, one where you<br>
have advance permission and have a specific account and password on<br>
that system, and one where the system allows anyone to request files<br>
from it.  The latter is done by using the "standard" account name of<br>
"anonymous" with your internet address as your password, and is known<br>
as "anonymous FTP".<br>
<p>
Note:  If you are using a system on BITNET, you have special<br>
capabilities through a different method.  See the bottom of this memo<br>
for additional details.<br>
<p>
FTP can be for small to enormous file areas.  Columbia University<br>
provides an anonymous FTP site to allow people to obtain the sources<br>
to the Kermit file transfer protocol.  In some cases, such as the<br>
massive SIMTEL20 archive operated by the White Sands Missle Range,<br>
this includes thousands of files which can be used by the IBM-PC,<br>
Macintosh, Amiga and other systems.<br>
<p>
While some people who either have university or commercial service<br>
accounts have the ability to do FTP directly to their local machine,<br>
then download the files from their local machine, a lot more people<br>
have E-Mail only access to Internet, and thus have no means available<br>
to do FTP and acquire these files.<br>
<p>
However, there is a way to obtain files from FTP sites and retrieve<br>
files by E-Mail.  This service is available by sending E-Mail<br>
messages to the FTPMAIL service provided by Digital Equipment<br>
Corporation to anyone with an Internet E-Mail address.  In fact, DEC<br>
operates an anonymous FTP site called "gatekeeper" that if you don't<br>
ask for a specific other site, it will make requests from gatekeeper.<br>
<p>
To be able to do E-Mail based FTP, you need to know the name of the<br>
site, then you simply tell FTPMAIL and ask it to obtain the files for<br>
you if that site permits "anonymous" FTP, i.e. where anyone can<br>
obtain any file from the system.  You send the message, and FTPMAIL<br>
eventually will either (1) send you back confirmation or (2) send you<br>
back a note saying you made a mistake.  If you got (1), it will then<br>
send you the requested files, in chunks of 64K or less.  If the file<br>
is smaller than 64K, you get it in one message.  If the file is<br>
larger than 64K, you get it in multiple messages.  (If you are on<br>
Compuserve, you need to set this limit to 49K; send a HELP message to<br>
find out about the CHUNKSIZE command.)<br>
<p>
I personally have used this method to send over 10 megabytes of files<br>
to me at my account on MCI Mail.  Note that you must know the system<br>
you want to retrieve and the exact file names.  In almost all<br>
instances, the particular case, UPPER OR lower, is critical and must<br>
be done exactly as indicated based on a listing from a DIR request.<br>
<p>
The way to make E-Mail FTP requests is to send a message to:<br>
<p>
        FTPMAIL@DECWRL.DEC.COM<br>
<p>
where a set of commands are sent as the text of the message.  (The<br>
title of the message is not used except to identify file(s) returned<br>
to you.)<br>
<p>
The full instructions can be obtained by sending a message with: HELP<br>
as a line in the text of the message.  The complete FTPMAIL<br>
capability includes other features including non-anonymous FTP,<br>
ability to retrieve a file in different sized pieces, and special<br>
password capability.<br>
<p>
The general method of sending a request is as follows (lines<br>
beginning with ; are comments; these comments are not included on<br>
FTPMAIL requests):<br>
<p>
TO:  FTPMAIL@DECWRL.DEC.COM<br>
; FTPMAIL's address<br>
CONNECT WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL<br>
; This is the name of the system I want to request from<br>
REPLY TDARCOS@MCIMAIL.COM<br>
; Here is where I want files I receive sent to<br>
BINARY<br>
UUENCODE<br>
; These two lines indicate I will be receiving 8-bit character<br>
; files and they should be sent to me as uuencoded binary so<br>
; that they can be sent as E-Mail.  If you are only doing DIR<br>
; requests, you can skip both of these<br>
GET PD1:&lt;MSDOS.DBASE&gt;WAMPUM42.ZIP<br>
; Here I am requesting the system send me a particular file<br>
; I am interested in.  Note that you can only request 10 files<br>
; at a time, more than that and your request is rejected<br>
DIR PD1:&lt;MSDOS&gt;<br>
; Here I want a directory listing.  This will come back as a<br>
; separate message<br>
QUIT<br>
; This is an optional command indicating that there are no more<br>
; FTPMAIL commands.  If your system appends tag lines or disclaimers,<br>
; to your messages, you should put this in so FTPMAIL will ignore<br>
; them.<br>
<p>
NOTE:  If your local system is a BITNET system, however, you can use<br>
the BITFTP server from Princeton, whose syntax is slightly different,<br>
and allows special features including direct binary transfers as<br>
opposed to DEC's FTPMAIL which, since it is running on the Internet<br>
as opposed to internal BITNET transfers, cannot provide this<br>
capability.  To use the BITNET server, you should send a message with<br>
HELP as the text to "BITFTP@PUCC.BITNET".  BITFTP will not send files<br>
to non-BITNET sites.<br>

[From Sue Harrington   ( sue@cuc.edu)]<br>
I have been reading SDA net for a couple of years and have not been an<br>
active part of the discussion though I read most of them.  At the end of<br>
this school year I will be leaving Columbia Union College where I have<br>
served as the coordinator and professor of computer science.  We have<br>
approximately 50 majors in computer science.  We have a laboratory that<br>
includes five Sun ELC's, one SLC, three 3B2's, 20 pc's--286`s. 386's,<br>
and 486's.  We have an active student chapter of the ACM.  For the last<br>
two years we have had a grant from the National Science Foundation to<br>
attract and retain undergraduate women in the study of computer science.<br>
 In the advanced Data Structures course this year we have six women and<br>
one man.  We are also concentrating on attracting African-American and<br>
Latino persons.  We also appear to be making an impact in this area.  <br>
<p>
We are looking for someone with a Ph.D. in computer science or a closely<br>
related field to come to Columbia Union College to replace me.  We want<br>
to encourage women and persons from groups other than the dominant one<br>
to apply, as well as others who are committed to passing on a knowledge<br>
of computer science.  You should have excellent teaching skills.  <br>
<p>
Takoma Park is a wonderful place to live.  We live on Sligo Creek<br>
Parkway, a couple of miles of school.  We can walk two different ways to<br>
work, both through parks.  We can run seven miles on running trails in<br>
one direction and two miles in the other direction.  We have an<br>
excellent track across the park from our condominium we one could do<br>
speed training.  What I am trying to say is if you think that urban<br>
living is undesirable you owe it to yourself to come to Washington, D.C.<br>
and see for yourself what a wonderful city it is.  On the weekends we do<br>
urban hiking through parks in the city to our hearts' content.<br>
<p>
If you are interested or know or someone who might be interested in this<br>
job please send me e-mail:  sue@cuc.edu or you could call the head of<br>
the Mathematical Sciences Department, Dr. Pauline David, Columbia Union<br>
College, 7600 Flower Avenue, Takoma Park, MD 20912 (301) 891-4171.  <br>
<p>
Looking forward to hearing from you,<br>
<p>

I was recently reading a psychology book entitled "The tyranny of malice:<br>
A study of the dark side of character and culture."  The author, Joseph<br>
Berke, states that most of the evil on this earth (both personal and<br>
national) are an expressions of three basic human emotions--envy, greed,<br>
and jealousy.  He presents various philosophies on how to deal with these<br>
negative emotions and why they won't work.  After 400 pages of very<br>
depressing reading of the very nature of these controlling forces, he<br>
ends with just 4 pages of solution.  (The correct solution, I believe, IMHO).<br>
He says there are three oppositves of envy, greed, and jealousy that are the<br>
only hope for eradicating evil from our personal thoughts and lives as well<br>
as the evil in community, family, and nation.  The cure is--GRATITUDE,<br>
GENEROSITY, and COMPASSION.  What a better world this would be if every<br>
person appreciated the bountious blessings given, showed that appreciation<br>
through generosity towards others, and served one another with compassionate<br>
service!  Isn't that the life Jesus Christ live?  Isn't that the life that<br>
His disciples should should live?  I pray that each one of us may pray for<br>
a greater measure of His Spirit to enable us to life that way!<br>

I enjoy reading the little notes people put in about themselves.  It makes it <br>
more interesting to asociate more than just a name with the messages.  So to be <br>
fair I should tell something about myself.<br>
<p>
I'm currently living in the Grand Rapids, Michigan area. I've been here since <br>
1979, when I took a position with Lear Siegler, now known as Smiths Industries <br>
after a couple of sales.  I work as a systems engineer in the aerospace field, <br>
specifically with navigation and guidance systems for transport aircraft.<br>
<p>
I went to school at Southwestern Union College and Walla Walla College, <br>
receiving a BSE in electrical engineering in 1977.  I've also earned an MBA from <br>
Grand Valley State University.<br>
<p>
My wife's name is Holly.  We have a 10-month old daughter, Abigail Ann.  She's <br>
teaching us how to be parents, and having a difficult time of it, some days.  I <br>
could go on and on, but those of you who are parents know what it is like, and <br>
those of you who aren't would be bored, so I'll stop.<br>
<p>
A year and a half ago the Wyoming (suburb of GR) church asked me to be the <br>
Pathfinder director for the club that was being organized.  This is quite a <br>
challenge for someone who has never even been a Pathfinder, ever.  But we were <br>
an honor club our first year and are having a successful second year.  My <br>
personality just isn't the type for many direct outreach activities, but I find <br>
that I can set up the program and the kids will go out and enjoy doing those <br>
activities that are so difficult for me to do personally.  It really brings home <br>
to me the fact that we are all members of the same body, and though we have <br>
different talents, together we can meet the goal of spreading the gospel to the <br>
world.<br>
<p>
I really enjoy reading the messages, so much so that I found myself interrupting <br>
my work to read them as they came in.  Now I'm on the Digest and it's much <br>
better even though some messages are nearly two weeks old by the time I read <br>
them.  I print the week's Digest on Friday and take it home to read and share <br>
with family and friends over Sabbath.<br>

<p>
I'm not sure if I would say people have lost an understanding of the<br>
message, though one could possibly make a case for this.  I do think,<br>
however, that we are failing to reach the majority of people because we<br>
have not realised that most people don't even believe in God, let alone<br>
the mark of the beast.  Traditionally, our outreach has always been most<br>
successful in attracting other christians.  I was told recently that<br>
this is the case even in non-christian countries such as the pacific<br>
islands: most of our membership comes from people already converted to<br>
other christian denominations, and compared to them we convert<br>
relatively few heathens.  (If anyone with better than third hand<br>
knowledge can correct this, please do so.)<br>
<p>
In such an environment (i.e., atheistic/agnostic), it is very important<br>
that our beliefs should be seen to have a positive impact on our<br>
lifestyle.  We shouldn't need to preach green-ness, but if we only<br>
preach the mark of the beast and the last judgement, people may be<br>
justified in missing the connection.<br>

Dear SDAnetters,<br>
<p>
I've been off the net for a few days and note a huge accumulation of postings<br>
about translations of the Bible and the environment.  You've all been busy!<br>
Not to side track the discussions or anything.  But I have had a particularly<br>
difficult two weeks dealing with some family tragedies.  Before I do though,<br>
I would like to point out that Jesus Christ was concerned about the<br>
environment.  After the feeding of the 5,000, He instructed the disciples to<br>
pick up the uneaten debri and collected it into baskets.  The Bible doesn't<br>
say it was for the purpose of saving it for the hungry.  I interpret this to<br>
mean that He was setting an example about how to respect the earth He created<br>
for us.<br>
<p>
Now on to the topic on my heart--death and grieving.  On XMAS day my sister's<br>
mother-in-law suffered a massive brain stem stroke.  After 3 agonizing weeks<br>
she finally died and they buried her last Friday.  My sister's husband was<br>
very close to his mother, having lost his father when he was 14.  She was<br>
just 70 years old and a very dear grandmother to my niece and nephew.  As<br>
all would guess, this has been a real family tragedy and very difficult for<br>
them to cope with.  Ironically, though, grief sometimes makes people act<br>
very strange and crazy and those grieving inflict pain on other family<br>
members.<br>
<p>
My brother-in-law's mother did not leave a will.  (Why do so many SDA's<br>
fail to leave a last will and testament?  Do they presume that Jesus Christ<br>
will return in their lifetime?)  He was one sister and over the years they<br>
have been quite close.  Their families vacation together every year even<br>
though thelive 1200 miles apart.  But their mother's death and the ensuing<br>
events of funeral and dealing with the estate has caused agonizing pain to<br>
my brother-in-law.  The sister and family arrived from out-of-state and<br>
immediately began rummaging through the deceased's home and earthly belongings.<br>
The kids gathered precious family treasures and claimed them for their own.<br>
My brother-in-law was horrified that they picked through the stuff like<br>
"the spoils of war" and his mother had not even been buried yet.  He begged<br>
his sister to please wait to discuss distribution of the her belongings<br>
until "she's in the ground."  But his sister wouldn't listen.  Major war<br>
broke out with the sister placing claim on everything of sentimental<br>
value stating that "mom would want **ME** to have this".  She refused to<br>
help pay any of the funeral expenses so my sister's family had to borrow<br>
$8,000 to cover the costs.  Immediately after the funeral, the "vulchers"<br>
returned to the home, gathering up everything they could possibly pack<br>
into their car and they left California to return home.  My sister found<br>
a note 3 days later (when their family ventured to the home), written by<br>
the "greedy" sister.  The note said, "Now that I have everything I want,<br>
do whatever you want with the rest."  My sister's family is left with<br>
the enormous task of packing up the deceased's belongings, the sale of<br>
the mobile home, paying off her debts which far exceed what the estate is<br>
worth, and disposing of what is not wanted.<br>
<p>
They had major fights about the funeral arrangements.  My brother-in-law<br>
knew his mother did not want to be cremated.  Yet the sister kept insisting<br>
that "it would be cheaper" and "she wouldn't know the difference anyway."<br>
The emotional support expected from family members was totally missing.  The<br>
sister seemed oblivious to the loss they had both just experienced.  For all<br>
intents and purposes, she was there to stake her claim on what she wanted<br>
and didn't seem to care about paying any respect for the dead.  My sister<br>
was deeply troubled by this and the agonized with the torment her husband<br>
was experiencing.  The loss of his mother was great but the attitude of<br>
his sister was killing him inside he said.<br>
<p>
Now I can't judge this woman but I cannot understand this behavior any more<br>
than my sister or her husband can.  It is SO OUT OF CHARACTER for her and<br>
so very unexpected.  Today, my sister discovered that the "pink slip" to<br>
the deceased's car was among the items taken out of state.  So my brother-<br>
in-law cannot sale the vehicle.  The sister took all of the family photo<br>
albums, all the personal effects of importance, and all items of value.<br>
Because these were removed from the state of where the deceased resided,<br>
my brother-in-law can't do anything about liquidating the estate to pay<br>
off some of the deceased's debts.<br>
<p>
Tonight, my sister called me sobbing her heart out.  She was at "Gram's<br>
trailer" and was supposed to packing up stuff.  But she just couldn't.<br>
<p>
Everything she packed reminded her of Gram's.  The very act of packing<br>
her stuff seemed a violation of Gram's life and privacy.  She couldn't<br>
stand it.  She missed Gram's so much.  (My sister was very close to her<br>
mother-in-law).  The hurt inflicted on her husband by his sister had<br>
become intolerable.  How could the two families ever speak again?  How<br>
could help her husband cope with the loss of both mother and sister?<br>
<p>
I'm asking the people on the net for help.  What can I say to my sister<br>
and the grieving husband?  What could possibly motivate such sibling<br>
cruelty at such a time of great grief?  How can my brother-in-law cope<br>
with these losses?  I can't tell him she didn't mean it.  I can't tell<br>
him to "forgive" or "leave it in God's hands."  I think the worst shame<br>
of all this is that my sister and her husband have been inactive SDAs<br>
for many years and just started attending church at their kids' request.<br>
This "cruel" sister is a very active SDA with conference office connections.<br>
Will my sister's family ever go to church again?  The wounds inflicted by<br>
the SDA sister are very deep and hideous.<br>
<p>
Thanks for your thoughtful replies.<br>
<p>
Cheryl<br>

In the summer of 1990 my brother and I had the opportunity of traveling<br>
to eastern Europe to see what things were like after the fall of the <br>
Berlin Wall.  It was an eye-opening experience in many ways, not the <br>
least of which was the realization it brought to me of how privileged <br>
"Westerners" are, especially Adventist Westerners.  I trust you will not<br>
bemoan the following as simply a vignette of the "be thankful for what<br>
you have" variety.<br>
<p>
All the discussion of Adventist education brings to mind the time Ron<br>
(my brother) and I decided to look up a church in Budapest.  It was <br>
Sabbath morning and time was running short.  I figured it may be tough to<br>
find an Adventist church on such short notice since I didn't know<br>
Hungarian.  Nonetheless, I went to the phone book and started thumbing <br>
through the S section.  No luck.  Then the A's.  Ah hah!  The only listings<br>
involving something to do with "Adventista" jumped out at me.  I checked the<br>
map and found the street listing for what turned out to be the largest<br>
Adventist church in Hungary.<br>
<p>
It didn't appear to be a church from the street entrance, but we figured,<br>
"Who else would be meeting on Saturday morning?"  Sure enough.  One look at<br>
some of the literature posted on the bulletin board  (Voice of Prophecy <br>
or Adventist World Radio, or something like that) and I knew we were at <br>
the right place.<br>
<p>
After the service (of which I didn't understand a word, but still enjoyed),<br>
we talked with a young man (age 20, I would guess) who spoke pretty good<br>
English.  He wanted to train for the ministry but his conference didn't <br>
have the money to send him to any of the Adventist institutions of western<br>
Europe or North America.  He said he was attending a Calvinist seminary in<br>
Hungary since this was affordable.<br>
<p>
Doesn't something seem wrong about a young Adventist eager to train for the<br>
pastorate at ANY Adventist institution but is unable, while scores of well-to-<br>
do Adventists such as myself dissect the myriad perceived faults and <br>
injustices of a parochial school system designed to prepare Christians to <br>
serve Christ more effectively?  (Do I have consensus on this albeit overly<br>
general but hopefully undisputable definition of Adventist education's <br>
mission?) Where is our sense of perspective?  (I speak to myself as well as<br>
to the net.)  For the cost of sending a few young adults to an SDA college<br>
we can hold meetings in Russia where hundreds, if not thousands, of people<br>
make decisions for Christ.  Thus, it would appear that we value Adventist<br>
education highly.  Do we?  Perhaps the crisis many feel is developing in<br>
Adventist education is not one of quality but of purpose, as many of the <br>
posts preceding mine have alluded to.<br>
<p>
I've said enough.  I hope this adds another viewpoint to the already lively<br>
discussion on this topic.<br>

[These are the words of Paul Johnston, double-spaced due to the fact<br>
that sometimes people forget to end each line with a CR and make messages<br>
which I can't send out over the net unless I edit them.  He refers to <br>
the post of a Dean M. Kelley, which puzzles me since there is no such<br>
person on the net.  SCT]<br>
<p>
I see a connecting thread through much of the correspondence of the past<br>
<p>
few months.  There is a struggle over identity.  What is the real<br>
<p>
Adventist Church?  And what's a real Adventist?  From what I've read, it<br>
<p>
seems like a lot of us are trying to figure out if, or how, we each fit<br>
<p>
in.<br>
 <br>
I'm writing you now without answers to those questions--except to say,<br>
<p>
"It depends..."  But my own questions of identity came a little more<br>
<p>
into focus reading the items from Alice Fay Martin and Dean M. Kelly.  I<br>
<p>
hope some of you can bring your unique perspectives to bear on these<br>
<p>
problems.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, there's probably a link between what I see as an identity<br>
<p>
crisis in North American Adventism and flat growth charts.  Yet, isn't<br>
<p>
identity diluted by diversity?  And isn't diversity an unavoidable<br>
<p>
biproduct of growth?  And doesn't growth depend on distinctiveness?  And<br>
<p>
isn't distinctiveness the source of an organization's identity?  And<br>
<p>
isn't identity diluted by diversity?  And...  you must be gettng my<br>
<p>
drift.<br>
<p>
I guess the difficulty is this:  no denomination can be expected to be<br>
<p>
big enough to contain any individual's unique set of needs,<br>
<p>
indiosyncracies, and beliefs.  But no individual is strong enough to<br>
<p>
stand alone either.  In my case, the SDA Church is certainly far from a<br>
<p>
perfect fit.  (In fact, it's an outfit which too frequently embarrassed<br>
<p>
me.)  But there is a symbiosis where I've gained important spiritual<br>
<p>
nurture and where I've been able to contribute significantly to the<br>
<p>
church body, at least on a local level.  That's kind of an<br>
<p>
issues-oriented answer and kind of a cultural answer and kind of<br>
<p>
lukewarm.  It lacks the "burning in the bosom" which my Mormon friends<br>
<p>
testify to.<br>
<p>
So Alice Fay's central question strikes close to home for me.  I hope<br>
<p>
some of you will come up with a better answer than I have so far.  She<br>
<p>
asks, "How can I know the culture from the important issues...?"  Alice<br>
<p>
Fay--as far as I can tell, we'll never be able to distinguish the<br>
<p>
culture from the important issues.  Culture isn't an isolated commodity.<br>
<p>
 A culture is defined by its people, its issues, politics, art, history,<br>
<p>
economics, religion.  A person is defined by the culture around him or<br>
<p>
her.  So there's an unbreakable tie between a people and a person. <br>
<p>
There's also an unbreakable tie between what you call "culture" and what<br>
<p>
you call "important issues."  If there's something screwy about our<br>
<p>
Adventist culture, there must be something screwy about its<br>
<p>
sources--something in our psyche or hermeneutical style or origins or<br>
<p>
whatever.  The best you and I can do now is decide if it's worth our<br>
<p>
effort to try to contribute to the subculture of Adventism and if we<br>
<p>
like the influence it's having on us.<br>
<p>
There's not much we can do about your friend's observation about our<br>
<p>
rules without her "getting inside" our culture.  Every culture has<br>
<p>
certain defining values.  They look ridiculous and arbitrary to the<br>
<p>
uninitiated.  But they're not entirely arbitrary.  They've evolved,<br>
<p>
partly by design and partly, I think, by accident.  These "rules" shape<br>
<p>
us and tell us who we are until, or unless, we chuck 'em.<br>
<p>
I'm active in the Shadyside SDA Church in Pittsburgh.  It's close to<br>
<p>
where I work at WQED.  I also like to attend St. Andrew's Episcopal<br>
<p>
Church, close to where I live.  Now, Episcopalians have rules too.  I<br>
<p>
mean cultural rules.  There are things you just do.  Some of them seem<br>
<p>
silly to the alien.  There are a lot of what we Adventists tend to call<br>
<p>
empty or meaningless rituals.  But as you participate in--become a part<br>
<p>
of--those rituals, over time, they take on meaning for you.  They are<br>
<p>
empty only as long as you bring nothing to them.  You discover that the<br>
<p>
seemingly meaningless rote of the liturgy is neither meaningless nor<br>
<p>
rote--it's just not as theatrical as we Adventists expect.  Ritual is<br>
<p>
valuable and unavoidable on individual and corporate levels.  But one<br>
<p>
person's meaningful ritual is another's irrelevent rule.<br>
<p>
Obviously, I'm the type Dean M. Kelley warned against when telling us<br>
<p>
elsewhere on the net what Adventists can do to stop growing.  He pointed<br>
<p>
out--and statistics support his case--that growing churches are<br>
<p>
conservative and distinctive.  Fellow networkers, that brings us back to<br>
<p>
questions I have about the identities of my church and myself.  Is<br>
<p>
conservatism something I want to preserve in order to see the<br>
<p>
institution grow?  If we deliberately try to preserve our uniqueness,<br>
<p>
don't we run the risk of being a mere novelty?<br>

Tim Swensen asks (and I apologize if I miss his point) why those of us<br>
fortunate enough to attend our Adventist schools criticize those same schools,<br>
especially when many people in other countries, who dearly wish to attend,<br>
cannot do so due to financial or political barriers.<br>
<p>
I feel that this is a way of avoiding the issue.  A similar argument advanced<br>
by a residence hall dean was, "if you don't like it here (because you don't<br>
feel like you're being treated like adults,) exercise your assumed right as an<br>
adult to leave and go elsewhere."<br>
<p>
Why can't I have both?<br>
<p>
Why must I accept being treated like less than a person in order to receive a<br>
Christian education?  I do not want my Adventist school to turn into a huge<br>
public school.  If I wanted a huge public university setting with the<br>
hedonistic lifestyle that goes along with it I would have gone there.  Are the<br>
defenders of Adventist education so arrogant (sorry, strong word) as to say<br>
that they have the perfect system "because people want to attend from all over<br>
the world" and that there is no room for improvement?<br>
<p>
I believe that our schools can fulfill their mission of training people for<br>
service without being patronizing and controlling.  Further, I believe they<br>
can provide a Christian environment without micromanaging the lives of each of<br>
the students.  This is the end I advocate.  Can't we have it both ways?<br>

This is a reply forwarded from Paul Gates with a few added <br>
comments from myself, denoted by &lt;.....&gt;<br>
.............<br>
<p>
I read your email on the SDA net and wanted to make a couple of <br>
comments.<br>
<p>
Concerning your friend who married outside of her faith, I would <br>
hesitate to say that she is not saved. We really do not have that <br>
prorogative(spelling??). From reading your message I would say that <br>
the Pastor and the people must also accept a part of the blame.<br>
<p>
I have been a pastor for 36 years and I hope I have learned a few <br>
things.I do not know all the "in's and out's of this situation but I can <br>
share with you how I would have handled the situation.<br>
<p>
It would appear that the pastor did counsel with the young lady and <br>
advise her not to marry outside of the faith and explain to her all the <br>
reasons for that counseling.  <br>
<p>
 &lt;&lt;..... Unfortunately, there was no counseling from the pastor.  From <br>
what I understand they did not request counseling. There was a <br>
request to use the church building for the service but it was basically <br>
ignored by the pastor (no reply) so they had the service in a Moslem <br>
prayer hall.  To complete though, I think there were a number of <br>
church members who did take the time to express thier concern with <br>
her decision, but clearly declined to attend the wedding......afm &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
If she still went ahead and married the young man. I would have <br>
accepted her decision and let her know that I did. Our social <br>
committee would have had a bridal shower for the young girl. I <br>
would have made it a point if possible to make friends with the <br>
young man and discover what his interests are. If he played golf I <br>
would take him out golfing with me and say nothing about the <br>
situation -- just have a good time with him and get  better <br>
acquainted with him. My wife and I would socialize with them <br>
outside of church time. Since I am an Amateur radio operator I <br>
would discovered if the couple would like to come over to the house <br>
and let them see or hear I should say some of the contacts that I <br>
could make with other stations in USA as well as overseas. I would <br>
let them both know that the church felt like they (the church) loved <br>
them and were their extended family! I would try to involve them in <br>
church activities whenever possible.   &lt;&lt;... We did have a nice shower <br>
for her...&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
By doing the above you are not condoning the "union" and the girl <br>
knows that but she would also know that the Pastor and the church <br>
still loved both and were their friends. They made the decision to get <br>
married in spite of the counseling. So let's pick up from here and go <br>
on. I have plenty of couples in my church that wed non-believers in <br>
the past. Sometimes this happens because there are no available <br>
Adventists to marry. The non-SDA spouses are very close to the <br>
members of the church and in a few cases the spouses have given up <br>
their church affilation and joined the Adventist church. I have 2 <br>
prospective spouses right now that may be baptized by the end of <br>
the year. BTW when I did the counseling I would have counseled <br>
both of them and I would let the young man know what it meant to <br>
marry an SDA. <br>
<p>
This morning I went golfing with the Episcopalian, &amp; Lutheran <br>
Pastors. The Catholic Priest was supposed to go with us but he had a <br>
funeral. We all had a good time playing 9 holes and then went to <br>
McDonald's for lunch. While we were eating both pastors said to me, " <br>
You know Paul, sometime I would like to know what Adventist really <br>
believe we do not know anything about Adventism and have always <br>
wondered. We know you all go to church on Saturday but that is the <br>
extent of our knowledge." I belong to the local ministerial association <br>
with them. We all thought today that it would be a good idea to share <br>
with one another at one of our ministerial meetings what we as <br>
christians believe.<br>
<p>
You can never tell what will happen or what God has in mind even <br>
when we go against His plan as in the case with your friend.<br>
<p>
Paul Gates<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;...  Thanx for the reply...  The more I look at this situation I think I <br>
am just sad to observe it.  This lady is a wonderful person.  She <br>
directed a play with a "young adult" cast not more than 4 months ago <br>
and enjoyed being a greeter on Sat. mornings, and yet in full <br>
knowledge of the risks and possible sacrifices she was taking, went <br>
ahead.... and now she appears reluctant to participate.  Maybe it will <br>
just take time and yes continued love from the church.  Maybe I just <br>
lack faith in them and myself to do so..... &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;...Just for interest sake... this was also a marriage of two different <br>
races.  I haven't a problem with this but fear it may add even more <br>
differences and complexities in the future....&gt;&gt;<br>

Concerning the marriage of adventists to non SDA's Paul gates wrote that we<br>
should still socialise and be friendly with them. <br>
<p>
&lt;By doing the above you are not condoning the "union" and the girl <br>
&lt;knows that but she would also know that the Pastor and the church <br>
&lt;still loved both and were their friends. They made the decision to get <br>
&lt;married in spite of the counseling. So let's pick up from here and go <br>
&lt;on.<br>
<p>
I think that this extremely important.  We don't have to agree with their<br>
decision but by being critical and often downwright rude we aren't giving that<br>
person (or perhaps more importantly their spouse) a very good impression of us<br>
and our church.  The church is not some exclusive social club.  We are very<br>
happy to welcome visitors into our churches irrespective of their religion. <br>
Why shouldn't we afford the same degree of friendship to our own members?<br>
<p>
Often people who marry outside there own religion will experience this sort of<br>
attitude where it's like they are no longer welcome at church.  If we maintain<br>
our support and friendship at least they may still be SDA's even if their<br>
spouses never do. <br>

I saw Dave Thomas' post a while ago and didn't have time to respond--<br>
things have been quite hectic as I am in the midst of a move with <br>
half of my stuff in Pittsburgh and the other half in Chicago  (I'm<br>
heading towards Pittsburgh) and there is still a lot of work to be done<br>
in Chicago.<br>
<p>
At Carnegie Mellon we tried a few things.  There are three SDA students<br>
at CMU that I know about right now, and there are times that I've been the <br>
only one.  <br>
<p>
Principle 1:  If you offer free food, someone will always show up.<br>
Students can't resist.<br>
<p>
Principle 2:  Students want discussion that's relevant to them.  Even <br>
though they may be yuppie wanna-be's, they aren't interested in going<br>
to listen to a bunch of doctors moaning about how hard it is to find <br>
good tires for their Volvo.  Students deal with real-life problems.<br>
<p>
Principle 3:  You need to keep it cheap.  Most students are poor<br>
and may have problems going out to eat somewhere, or other expensive things.<br>
They may also be ashamed to admit it.<br>
<p>
Principle 4:  If you are part of a group which includes students and <br>
other young professionals, and you are planning an activity to which the <br>
whole group is not invited, have enough tact not to discuss your activity<br>
in front of those who are not invited.  In many groups an "inner circle"<br>
is obvious and obnoxious.<br>
<p>
Principle 5:  Go through the exercise of making a list of every <br>
SDA college student in your town.  You will find there are lots more <br>
than you think.<br>

In various articles on SDAnet you have heard me celebrate the death of <br>
the SDA subculture.  However, since nobody has told the people at the <br>
SDA colleges that the subculture is dead yet, it still persists in <br>
these historical communities.  This article is meant to delineate the<br>
choices for the silent majority of SDA's who are moving ahead into the <br>
brave new world of post-institutional Adventism.<br>
<p>
Bull and Lockhart described the dilemma in terms of Adventism being<br>
forced to choose between the medical orientation and the spiritual<br>
orientation.  <br>
It seems that the idea of being a self-contained subculture is not for<br>
the future.  It never was right to be peculiar just for the sake of<br>
being peculiar, and it is now not feasible.  Those who have suffered<br>
with the self-<br>
consciousness of being different for so many years have now woken up to see<br>
that in many ways we aren't different after all.  Those who gloried in<br>
digging up imaginary persecutors and conspiracy theories now are even<br>
running short on these, as we have a church not capable of infurating<br>
anyone except its own dissidents.<br>
<p>
But is the only other way the alternative mentioned by Bull and Lockhart<br>
to be the model minority, a superculture as it were, where the men are<br>
handsome, the women are beautiful, and all the kids are above average?<br>
Should we put our lifestyle forth as a sort of spiritual Epcot center?<br>
<p>
I think from the limited experience we have with this option, we would be <br>
ill-served to put ourselves on a pedestal to be examined with the<br>
microscope of public opinion.  As medical stars build up (John Harvey<br>
Kellogg,<br>
Leonard Bailey, Ben Carson) their capacity for faux pas increases.<br>
<p>
So should we become a counterculture?  I'm not sure.  I do think we need to <br>
re-evaluate the emphasis on individualism which has permeated our religion.<br>
We ought not to be afraid to violate cultural norms which are not consonant<br>
with the gospel of Christ.  At the same time, we shouldn't trail society<br>
in respect for human rights, getting pushed at the point of law.<br>

Steve, Just a couple of sidelights on your comments. It has been my<br>
experience that the Adventist heros never mention that they are Adventists<br>
to the world. We are the only ones that know it, it appears. -- I am<br>
talking about interviews, etc. on tv and radio. Perhaps it is a good idea<br>
to have it that way when heros become un-heros.<br>
<p>
The other comment has slipped my mind, so I will have to add it later!!<br>
<p>
I have deposited a little money at Andrews as a result of 3 children<br>
attending there. They tell me it was a "jungle" -- they compared it to<br>
Jackson Prison, Steve. -- not because of the faculty or the so called<br>
system but because of the riff-raft who were allowed to attend Andrews. 2<br>
of my children did get out of Andrews and still remain Adventists, 1<br>
didn't.<br>
<p>
I realize that this probably has nothing to do with what you are talking<br>
about Steve. I get ansi when we say we are using the same traditional ways<br>
in our colleges in particular. They do not work!<br>
<p>
When I drive on an Academy or College campus I get that "funny feeling" in<br>
the pit of my stomach still! I think of the way I was treated as well as<br>
my children when we were in school.<br>
<p>
I do not think I am repeating myself but I can give an example to let you<br>
know where I am coming from.<br>
<p>
My son was in the school band, they had been gone this particular Sabbath<br>
to a church in the area to present a program. The "uniform" was turtle<br>
neck sweater, matching slacks and sport coat. When they got back to the<br>
school in the late afternoon they did not have time enough to change<br>
clothes. They went to vespers and my son with two others (trumpet trio)<br>
had been asked to play for special music. Nothing was said to the boys<br>
prior to their playing by the faculty in charge.<br>
<p>
As soon as the vesper program was over the 3 boys were taken "in hand" by<br>
a couple of the faculty members and said since they did not wear a dress<br>
shirt and tie to Vespers they could not perform in the band concert that<br>
evening and would be confined to their rooms.<br>
<p>
My wife and I + our other children were there when this happened and<br>
witnessed all this because we were there for the evening concert. At that<br>
point I "butted" into the conversation and said that they might restrict<br>
him from playing in the concert but he was not going to be confined to his<br>
room since we were there. I checked with the principal and I had his<br>
support. We went out to supper that evening and had as good of a time as<br>
we could as a family.<br>
<p>
Years later, after my son had left the church, he received a letter from<br>
both of these faculty member's stating that they wanted to apologize for<br>
their actions for they had really been out to get my son and they knew<br>
what they had done was wrong.<br>
<p>
Some on the net may think that was an exception to the rule but it wasn't<br>
I could tell you some horror stories that happened to my 2 daughters which<br>
were really ridiculous because it was over petty, non-essential stuff that<br>
would turn a seasoned adult away.<br>
<p>
I am not blaming Adelphian Academy, Andrews University for the attitude of<br>
my grown children today, I realize that young people still make their own<br>
decisions and in my son's case he could have chosen to do things<br>
differently and be wiser in choice of friends.<br>
<p>
I have pastored several academy churches, was an associate pastor at<br>
Southern College and I can assure you that my expertize of ministry is<br>
not at an "Adventist Ghetto."<br>
<p>
Evelyn (my wife) and I were discussing just the other day, we do not want<br>
to retire, (if we ever do) at an Adventist Ghetto. We would prefer to<br>
live where there is no Adventist church -- A place where we can get<br>
acquainted with the town people, associate with them, socialize with them<br>
and eventually begin a Bible study group and teach the gospel as it is in<br>
Jesus. If we could plant a church that would be great. That is our goal.<br>
<p>
till next time, Steve,<br>
<p>
...........Paul<br>

Steve would like to declare the subculture dead and in many ways it is.<br>
Many have realized that the goal of turning out thousands of well-trained<br>
workers for the church is not happening.  SDA colleges ARE turning out<br>
well-trained workers for society, productive individuals who are responsible,<br>
law-abiding citizens.  The "SDA factory" which intended to turn out many<br>
identically-thinking SDAs whose primary loyalty in life is the SDA church<br>
malfunctioned a long time ago.  Young people were encouraged to think and<br>
decide for themselves and then saddled with rules and regulations that<br>
strip them all dignity implying they really can't think and decide for<br>
themselves.  Many now know the truth of the matter.  The primary purpose<br>
of SDA educational system is train for church-related jobs.  Many majors<br>
that do not have a role in the institution have never been offered at<br>
SDA colleges.  (Is a J.D. offered anywhere?  How about a Ph.D. in Psychology?<br>
A Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics?)  Actually doctorates have been essentially in<br>
the Professions (M.D., D.D.S) or education (Ed.D.).  There has never been<br>
an active thrust to provide for all fields because the church mainly needed<br>
teachers for the elemetary and secondary school systems and medical personnel<br>
for the health system and missionary appointments.  The SDA educational<br>
system of higher education was to provide training for "SDA church jobs."<br>
This changed when many young people in the 1960s started looking at other<br>
career options and SDA colleges gradually changed to offer "Christian<br>
education" as opposed to "Heathen edcuation at public colleges".  Somebody<br>
forgot why the system was started in the first place!  I find it very<br>
interesting that at least 50% of SDA medical school graduates before 1960<br>
served as missionaries while maybe 1/100 of 1990s graduates will even<br>
think about doing so.  When the SDA church lost is "Medical Missionary"<br>
focus, the SDA educational system lost its reason to exist.  So it changed<br>
into a place where a young person could be indoctrinated.  I remember my<br>
parents lamenting that so and so's child had rebelled and was going to<br>
attend state college.  In other words, not wanting to go to SDA college<br>
was equivalent to apostacy--a refusal be indoctrinated.  This transition<br>
is obvious when you talk with anyone who attended SDA college before 1950-60.<br>
They aren't bitter about ridiculous rules and regulations.  My own parents<br>
always felt it was a "privilege" to attend Union College and what a job<br>
in the church meant to them.  It meant security.  It meant working with<br>
believers.  It was to be "heaven on earth".  Ask anyone who attended in<br>
the 1960-70s and you will find many bitter young people.  Those who suffered<br>
gross injustices.  Those who rebelled at the heavy-handed military-style<br>
discipline.  Those who were kicked out of college for seemingly minor<br>
infractions.  (I was kicked out of the dorm at La Sierra one semester about<br>
finals time.  I was never told WHAT I had done and was given no chance to<br>
either defend myself on anonymous charges or understand why I was being<br>
treated so.  GUILTY without chance of a trial is universal among SDA<br>
institutions.  Even now, 20 later, I do not know what I as accused of.  I<br>
do know that my two roommates, daughters of rich influential doctors at<br>
Loma Linda, didn't want a 3rd roommate and had made my life miserable for<br>
months before that.  After a plea to the President of the College, I was<br>
allowed to take final exams as long as I commuted from home with a car<br>
I did not have.  That was the most miserable semester in my life!)<br>
<p>
Almost all SDA college gradautes are functioning members of society.  I<br>
think the number in prison is minute.  Just because they didn't stay in<br>
the church doesn't mean the system has failed.  It means that many SDA<br>
now see SDA college for what it really is--NOT a place to train for a<br>
church-related job!  NOT a place to indoctrinate young people!  It IS<br>
a place where SDA young people can study together and prepare for careers,<br>
and become functional members of society.  If that happens with the last<br>
(least) amount of grief, then the systems is successful.  The success of<br>
an educational institution is measured by the number of graduates who are<br>
successful in careers and life!<br>

I have to disagree with this.  If we measure schools in this way, then<br>
sending your kid to, say, a Jesuit school would be even better than an<br>
SDA one.<br>
<p>
SDA schools may do a miserable job, but surely they do have a purpose<br>
beyond keeping people out of jail.<br>

I've been following the discussion regarding Adventist education and<br>
institutions with interest, and one thing which has come across very<br>
strongly is this conclusion that SDA schools are not "working" at all.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that some of you guys are viewing the system as a "system",<br>
and not as a collection of individuals - which is what it is.<br>
<p>
By stating that they system is not working, are you criticizing the<br>
teachers in the schools? The school administrators? The school governing<br>
bodies? The church administrators? Adventists in general? Where do you<br>
see the failing link?<br>
<p>
Of course, in the above list I didn't even mention the students themselves.<br>
I don't think it is fair to talk about students as being the "product of<br>
the system" as if they were passive participants in the process. The students<br>
themselves are a part of the system, and they must take the responsibility<br>
for their own decisions.<br>
<p>
I went to an Adventist high school and college here in Australia, and <br>
am now completing my B.Sc.(Hons) at a State university. I don't think<br>
I can agree that Adventist education "failed miserably" in the case<br>
of myself and most of my friends.<br>
<p>
Let the discussion continue...<br>

Cheryl listed a laundry list of vocational and technical training<br>
programs that maybe SDA colleges or even academies could offer.<br>
These included auto body, small business administration, cosmetology,<br>
construction technology, and others.  The above and other like programs<br>
are all available as 1 or 2 yr degrees from Andrews University.<br>
(with the exception of cosmetology which Andrews has a program with a <br>
local beauty school so that students can stay at Andrews but study<br>
at the beauty place--expensive but some people do it.)<br>
<p>
Andrews at one time had non-degree programs in these areas aimed more at<br>
the non-traditional college student, but the problem they found is <br>
that often students would want to do more college after this and the<br>
credits were not transferrable into a degree program.<br>

Bill's idea to put an SDA dorm at Urbana-Champaign is not a new idea.<br>
In fact, a similar idea is in process, and has been going for a couple<br>
years at Michigan State.  The East Lansing church recently bought a new<br>
church building, which came with a parsonage that their pastor didn't use.<br>
So they converted it to housing for MSU students, they have five the last I <br>
checked, all female.  They call it "Sigma Delta Alpha"  (and convieniently<br>
there is not a national fraternity by that name).<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems to me that as long as the place called "out there" is defined</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the minds of SDA students, then SDA schools have not done their job. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Once</i><br>
<i>&gt; a person leaves an SDA school, he or she should be ready to approach the </i><br>
<i>&gt; world, not as an enemy or a stranger, but ready to serve.  Of course, </i><br>
<i>&gt; some people never learn this task, SDA school or no.</i><br>
<p>
I think that's the point...it all comes down to the individual.<br>
<p>
As for the "out there" thing, I would venture to say that this<br>
is historically important in Adventism. Hence the main reason students<br>
have this place in their minds is through the attitudes of their parents<br>
and other members of their church community. If Adventist schools are<br>
perpetuating this attitude, then it is because the teachers also relate<br>
to society this way.<br>
<p>
How can any of us expect the system to change, when it is so self-<br>
perpetuating? Mostly those of us who disagree with the separationist<br>
stance do not teach within the SDA school system. Many of us never<br>
will, leaving the schools with a majority of teachers/administrators<br>
who continue to convey the "us and them" mentality.<br>
<p>
I definitely feel that if anything the schools reflect a slightly <br>
liberal side of the church populace in general. It seems unfair to<br>
criticize the people working in the institutions of the church when<br>
they are no worse than the general church attender. <br>
<p>
If a person feels they "can't relate" to people outside their church <br>
community, I hardly think this can be blamed on their school. There are <br>
plenty of agnostics in state schools that can't relate socially.<br>

Re:Adventist Education Failures....<br>

<i>&gt;strongly is this conclusion that SDA schools are not "working" at all.</i><br>
<p>
I would find this hard to believe.  But, on the other hand, what we are seeing<br>
is simply an extension of what the church as a body desires.  It is hard to<br>
blame everything on the governing council of the church, the adminstrators<br>
of the colleges, etc, when most often people are unwilling to take a stand on<br>
what they see as the necessary vision for Adventist education.<br>
<p>
Further, as the church has grown, have we not all seen the secularization of<br>
the church itself?  As a teenager in a non-Adventist home, I can remember<br>
many times visiting Adventist homes in the 70's where TV was not to be found.<br>
Today, it is rare that you don't see one in operation and also tons of VCR <br>
tapes (not a flame - I have a TV and a VCR.  Just a contrast in the times).<br>
<p>
Why should this not also occur with our institutions?  Through the years it<br>
can be said that we have been courting the media.  In order to do this you<br>
have to do something spectacular (transplant a monkey heart to a little girl)<br>
or else you have to change what people view as not important in their sight<br>
(possibly our sense of missions?  I don't know, just wondering aloud :-)<br>
<p>
As a teenager, I longed for SDA high schools.  I never could attend.  Then, as<br>
an young adult, I could only afford a single year at SW Adventist College.<br>
<p>
During that year, 1978, I guess I lost my innocence with regard to the schools.<br>
I also matured a lot during this time as I was forced to come in from the<br>
"real world" into the sub-culture.<br>
<p>
I don't know about the others on this list, but, I ended up graduating from <br>
a state-supported institution.  It was ALWAYS the rule that the professors<br>
spoke about what happened in the "real world".  And, how the university atmos-<br>
phere did not even compare.<br>
<p>
While in the sub-culture of Adventist colleges you have certain values and<br>
expectations, I found that the only difference in public college was that <br>
you had more "freedom" of expression.  You know, things like short dresses,<br>
long hair, stay up all night if you wanted to, not have chapel, etc, etc.<br>
<p>
While we can and should cheer the "death" of the sub-culture, let us be wary<br>
that we do not replace it with another culture that is unto death.  A sense <br>
of mission is the cornerstone of our educational system.  If we have lost that,<br>
then we really have nothing more than what another writer intimated, a<br>
second-rate educational system that will and cannot meet the expectations of<br>
a secular world and church.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The students</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves are a part of the system, and they must take the responsibility</i><br>
<i>&gt;for their own decisions.</i><br>
<p>
I agree.  The Valuegenesis study showed us that the students are more than <br>
willing to take responsibility if we let them.  Problem is, too many of our<br>
students have no sense of anything. (boy am I going to get it over that one :0)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Let the discussion continue...</i><br>
Amen.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Comments about "real world" deleted) - good, well thought post Steve....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the post-institutional world, we are not out debating on the street</i><br>
<i>&gt;corner how much percent of which flavor of Divine nature Christ had.  We</i><br>
<i>&gt;face the question of whether He existed at all from our non-Christian friends.</i><br>
<i>&gt;We face not semantics over righteousness by faith but the question of </i><br>
<i>&gt;whom one should have faith in. </i><br>
<p>
AMEN!!  More and more of the people that I work with and my friends are part<br>
of the new pagan movement - the New Age.  Service takes on a new meaning when<br>
speaking with them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Elmhurst SDA church is only five miles from Hinsdale and the large "SDA"</i><br>
<i>&gt;hospital and associated church.  Of the seven youth in my class, two</i><br>
<i>&gt;have a parent who works for the hospital, two are children of the pastor.</i><br>
<i>&gt;But even at that, the superstructure of the church has no impact on them</i><br>
<i>&gt;except for the indirect financial one.  Most of them have never seen </i><br>
<i>&gt;Andrews University, let alone considered going there.  Though we are </i><br>
<i>&gt;only 30 miles away from Broadview Academy, no youth from our church attend,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and only one of the seven is in the local day school.  The church to them</i><br>
<i>&gt;is the local church only.  And although they complain sometimes that</i><br>
<i>&gt;we don't get together more with other churches, they often miss the </i><br>
<i>&gt;activities that are planned.</i><br>
<p>
In my youth class at Rio Linda SDA Church in Rio Linda, California, we had on<br>
average 6 youth (in a church with an average attendence during Sabbath school<br>
of only 35 - 40 on good days).  Of these 6 youth, only 1 attended our schools.<br>
Of the 15 to 25 or so youth that attended our church (cradle roll -&gt; teen) I <br>
can recall that only 3 or 4 attended the church schools.<br>
<p>
Most families could not afford it.  Their children attended public schools.  In<br>
our youth group, we had several teens that smoked (their parents didn't know),<br>
one teen engaging in severe at-risk behaviour.  Several others thinking about<br>
one form or another of at-risk behaviour if not actually participating at one<br>
time or another.<br>
<p>
Those that did attend the church school wanted to go to the larger churches<br>
because that is where their friends went.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In my mind this is the disadvantage that comes as the administration</i><br>
<i>&gt;disintegrates under its own weight.  I want our young people to be able</i><br>
<i>&gt;to see that they are part of a larger, exciting, whole.  In the Chicago</i><br>
<i>&gt;area there are 800 baptized young people in the Illinois conference</i><br>
<i>&gt;churches, and probably an equal number in the Lake Region conference</i><br>
<i>&gt;churches.  Less than 150 of those attend Broadview Academy.  What structure </i><br>
<i>&gt;is our church going to establish for the other 75% of its youth?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I think this is one that you need to get the youth involved with.  Recently, <br>
our church in Bellevue, Washington had two nights where we met together and<br>
discussed where the church was headed.  ALL the youth were invited to <br>
participate.  Several of the more out-spoken showed up for both nights.<br>
<p>
Their voice carried the same weight as an adults.  (One person one vote <br>
principal applied, HEAVILY)  As a result of these meetings, a church committee<br>
was formed to implement the results of our reactions to the Valuegenesis<br>
study.  YOUTH are the committee's only concern.  I am hoping that this will<br>
help to prepare our church to actually reach those youth who are attending<br>
public schools and make it easier for them to invite their friends to our<br>
church.<br>
<p>
Who knows?  More updates as they happen.....<br>

I don't think our (Adventist) schools are "failing miserably."  I really<br>
don't.  The opportunity to study in a small-department environment is quite<br>
valuable and positive.  I got an undergraduate education that allows me to<br>
function at a level competitive with the some advanced degreed people here at<br>
the lab.  That is directly attributable to the availability of one-on-one<br>
caring faculty.<br>
<p>
My concerns focus more on the insularity and indoctrination/control that I<br>
experienced both at Andrews and at the academy.  This goes back to needing a<br>
metric other than enrollment to measure effectiveness.  The requirement for<br>
freshmen to stay in the dorms from 7:30 to 9:30 weeknights during their first<br>
quarter was justified in terms of keeping enrollment up (in a personal<br>
conversation with the dean when I was a junior.)<br>

<i>&gt;SO...WHY do SDA schools continue to focus on ridiculous standards such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;jewelry, make-up, and dress codes?  Why are "designer jeans" still prohibited?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why must the artificial standards of the previous generation still pervade</i><br>
<i>&gt;the SDA educational system?</i><br>
<p>
  I must admit to not knowing a thing about SDA school codes but for<br>
what it is worth;<br>
<p>
  As long as the 'code' is vague enough to allow individual variety, but<br>
specific enough to make it clear what is expected, a dress code is<br>
alright.  In fact, using the one in the Bible fits most occasions.<br>
Modest dress and not all painted up or bedecked with jewels.  IMO,<br>
things like 'designer jeans' (that are usually painted on), 5 earrings<br>
in each ear (but none that match), and a 1/4" of pancake mix (to hide a<br>
naturally pretty face) are not in keeping with God's ideas.<br>
<p>
  Modesty is never out-of-date.<br>

  Then, if an academy is started in Augsburg Germany it would be quite<br>
alright for the students to sunbath in the nude, right?  It is prefectly<br>
alright for the Germans living there now, they don't think it wrong.<br>

I don't like to see an extreme case dictate the way we act in "normal"<br>
situations.<br>
<p>
Neither do I like to see our normal kinds of judgments applied to extreme<br>
cases.<br>
<p>
"Sunbathing in the nude" is not an issue in Adventist academies in<br>
Australia, and I wouldn't expect that it is in the U.S.  The kinds of<br>
dress issues we face are things like jewellery +/-, wearing sleeveless<br>
shirts/singlet tops to class, skirt length , and, to a lesser extent,<br>
makeup.<br>
<p>
I agree that modesty often relates very much to the surrounding culture.<br>
 From what I've heard, the only women wearing jewellery in Bible times<br>
were prostitutes. This is no longer the case. Hence I can see good reasons<br>
why modest women in Bible times would not wear jewellery. The same reasons<br>
do not apply today.<br>
<p>
If a guy wears an earring in his left ear, it is supposed to indicate<br>
heterosexual promiscuity (as far as I know). As long as this is the case,<br>
a modest guy wouldn't wear an earring in his left ear.<br>
<p>
Surely modesty is all about the statements your appearance makes to those<br>
you come into contact with. It is the interpretation others make of the<br>
way you present yourself that is important. Hence if I came to the USA<br>
for a holiday I wouldn't wear my wedding ring to an Adventist church.<br>
Perhaps if I went to Germany I might sunbake nude!<br>
<p>
Then again, a sunburnt nose is one thing.....<br>
<p>
Tony<br>
<p>
P.S. When I was in academy we weren't allowed to wear jeans on Saturday<br>
afternoons (or shorts, actually).<br>

I was wondering if any of my Adventist brethren knew Hebrew and could give<br>
me a literal rendering of Daniel 11:14.  I ask this as it has implications<br>
on how to view this verse in prophecy.  My NRSV translates the last part<br>
of the verse as "The lawless among your own people shall lift themselves<br>
up in order to fulfill the vision, but they shall fail."  The way this is<br>
translated makes it seem that the lawless are a subset of "your own<br>
people".  Does the actual Hebrew imply this?  Or is it possible given the<br>
Hebrew to view the lawless as just coming in among the people and not<br>
necessarily being a part of them?<br>
<p>
Thanks for your help.<br>

Russell Grau:<br>
<p>
Hi Russell, Dress codes etc are not a problem of our generation only! My<br>
motherinlaw used to tell me about the hassle in her day!!<br>
<p>
Some christians, so called, focus so much on outward appearance that it<br>
frustrates other people. Then also the reasoning behind some codes or<br>
rules just does not make sense. Back in the 40s I was instructed in grade<br>
school and academy that movies were a no-no because of the evil influence<br>
of the people in attendance in theaters. That was no problem for me<br>
because I could go to a movie by myself, my parents or take my girl<br>
friend and we did not associate with the others in the theater. I might<br>
add and perhaps I have mentioned this before -- My dad was not an<br>
adventist. My dad had problems with drinking etc. My mother felt that<br>
going to movies on Sat. night was something we could do with my dad and<br>
keep him sober and away from the bars, women etc. My mother often told me<br>
that doing this was against the teachings of the Adventist church but at<br>
the same time she wanted to hold our family together.<br>
<p>
As I got older ........  Then there was the thing against going bowling<br>
because in some bowling  alleys they served beer. My friends and I could<br>
go bowling and leave and we didn't drink the beer and we did not go to<br>
movies.  I figured it was better than staying home on Saturday night and<br>
watching TV.<br>
<p>
One more case in point: When I moved to Grand Ledge, MI my son Clayton<br>
thought he might take his senior year of academy at Grand Ledge<br>
Adventist Academy and live home as oppossed to living in the dorm at<br>
Adelphian. As early in his life that Clayton could grow a mustache, he had<br>
one. When he went to pre-register at GLAA, he was told that he would have<br>
to shave his mustache off as it was not in keeping with the dress code of<br>
the school! Now mind you, he was willing to shave it off as it was no big<br>
deal. However, he could not get all the required subjects that he needed<br>
for his senior year so he went back to Adelphian for his senior year and<br>
kept his mustache which he wears today at age 35!<br>
<p>
It is things like the above that frustrates some of us. It seem like in<br>
the Adventist church that after something goes out of style that it is ok<br>
with Adventists. Beards are a good case in point.<br>
<p>
Idealistically, I believe that it is not my place to pin point everything<br>
that a Christian can or cannot do as it is in the minds of some people and<br>
preach it on Sabbath. I believe it is my mandate to point people to Christ<br>
and the gospel and allow the Holy Spirit to work in the life of an<br>
individual.<br>

Bill Nickless makes a good point in saying that we should be able to<br>
constructively criticize the Adventist educational system without being told<br>
to "live with it or leave it."  In this I wholeheartedly agree.  My story of<br>
the experience I had in Hungary was meant to supply some balance to what I felt<br>
to be a large number of fairly negative posts.  It was not meant to squelch the<br>
discussion.<br>
<p>
Indeed, I remember chafing under the sometimes weighty burden of rules I lived<br>
with in Adventist schools.  Being told that they are good for you is not<br>
terribly appealing at age 18!  My Mom and I chuckle at some of the antics her<br>
generation went through to go on an off-campus date.<br>
<p>
I feel it would be inaccurate to characterize Adventist schools as failing in<br>
their mission.  At the same time, it must be admitted that the goal of <br>
training students to make progressively more important decisions is a lofty <br>
one -- one which in many cases is unattained.<br>
<p>
So I ask the net, How do we as church leaders teach the younger generation <br>
to take more and more responsibility for their lives?  How do we teach them<br>
to ask the questions and gather the facts (from Scripture and human experience)<br>
that will enable them to make healthy choices?  And, crucially, how do we<br>
react when students choose to walk down ultimately destructive paths.  <br>
<p>
Since I am the teen Sabbath school class leader at our local church, I would <br>
be interested in your responses.  I am gleaning some important tidbits <br>
from Roger Dudley's book "Why Teenagers Reject Religion," but always welcome<br>
more.<br>

To Scott:<br>
<p>
Scott I do not think that Cheryl meant excessive makeup and jewelry and<br>
"wayout" clothes. Modest dress is a good way to say it -- perhaps that is<br>
more idealistic that we want to admit. When it comes to makeup, jewelry<br>
etc. --I know of many female christians that wear make up so that it<br>
looks natural and jewelry in good taste -- not in excess. I know what you<br>
mean by excess though -- rings on all fingers, 6 or more necklaces at a<br>
time, couple of bracelets on each arm and enough makeup to look like a<br>
clown! My wife is a clown incidently, and has done a lot of birthday<br>
parties etc. She calls herself "Angel The Clown" and for the part wears<br>
and spears a lot of makeup on to look the part. But, she doesn't wear that<br>
much makeup when she is wearing "street clothes" or even to church!!<br>

About a month ago, Fred Christiansen asked whether drug money would be<br>
acceptable if offered for funding. I don't remember anyone answering this,<br>
perhaps because it was intended to be obvious that such could never be.<br>
There are some difficult issues involved, but if no strings were attached<br>
the only hinderance would be some federal edict that allows seizure of<br>
all money and property obtained by or used for the purpose of trafficking.<br>
<p>
Let's imagine for a moment, some drug dealer comes to Christ and starts<br>
a new life. Let's say he has a pretty big fortune stashed away. Is it<br>
wrong for him to start giving (anonymous) donations to support Christian<br>
activity? Is it wrong for him to help finance a drug rehabilitation program,<br>
or any other social reform? Surely these monies would be better spent building<br>
up society, than in financing a bogus (IMHO) "war against drugs" which is<br>
stirring up quite a hornets nest.<br>
<p>
If money is tainted because of the route it has taken, then all money is<br>
inherently bad and should be shunned. On the other hand, money is needed<br>
for trading with material society in the furtherance of worthy goals.<br>
<p>
I am not advocating drug-running or gun-running as acceptable fundraisers,<br>
but the governments of the world have made these activities far more<br>
profitable than they deserve to be.<br>

The main campus library at Loma Linda University is named after a<br>
casino developer (Del Webb) who gave some money to the university.<br>
It's impractical to trace the origins of money to any depth, but I do<br>
think this goes too far.<br>

Every time I archive the messages from a previous month, I always find<br>
some things that were never finished.  I posed the trivia question<br>
"What hymn in the old SDA church hymnal has a tune written by <br>
Stephen Foster, but not attributed to him?"<br>
<p>
The hymn is number 430, "Long For My Saviour I've Been Waiting"<br>
and is sung to the tune of Foster's song "Nellie Was A Lady".<br>
<p>
This was only one of several early Advent hymns set to the music of <br>
Stephen Foster.  Another common one was sung to the tune of "Old Folks<br>
At Home."<br>

Since I'm in Pittsburgh now, the birthplace of Stephen Foster,<br>
I think about things like this.<br>

As I watched the political conventions, I was surprised how much the <br>
term "family values" came up.  Since our church's general conference<br>
much resembles a political convention,  in fact it was bigger than the <br>
Democratic National Convention, I'm wondering if there are any good<br>
ideas or any mistakes that we can learn from.<br>
<p>
The Republican party has given lip service to the "conservative family<br>
values" issue for the last twelve years but has proved largely unable <br>
to deliver, except by appointing conservative judges.   Proposals for<br>
aid for private schools, school prayer, and constitutional bans on<br>
abortion have gone essentially nowhere.<br>
<p>
What is the state of our church today?  Time was that a divorce meant<br>
automatic departure from the ministry.   Not anymore.    Today divorced<br>
and remarried ministers abound and flourish.   Perhaps the church is<br>
also moving away from the idea that ministers must be married with a<br>
family to  serve most effectively, and single ministers also have a<br>
calling.    <br>
<p>
Nevertheless the ideal of a pastor who is mature enough to look<br>
distinguished and have 20 years experience, yet with kids young enough<br>
to put in church school, is still with us.    The pastor with the wife<br>
who devotes her time to helping him rather than pursuing a profession is<br>
still thought to be desirable.  (In Pittsburgh, where we  are fortunate<br>
enough to have two pastoral families like this, I can assure you it is<br>
very nice indeed.)<br>
There is still a profile of the "climber"  the one who you can tell will <br>
be a conference president in short order.  And beside every one of these<br>
people, there is a wonderful wife.<br>
<p>
Are these stereotypes necessarily bad?  Are churches benefitted because<br>
they set these high standards for their ministers?   The churches I know<br>
who have insisted on quality haven't regretted it.<br>

<i>&gt; The main campus library at Loma Linda University is named after a</i><br>

<i>&gt; think this goes too far.</i><br>
<p>
Del Webb was (I believe he's dead now) a real estate developer.  Casinos<br>
represent a rather modest portion of his vast enterprises.  Several<br>
huge retirement towns (Sun City, Sun City West, et al) exist in Arizona,<br>
all developed by Del Webb.  There are also many other Del Webb subdivisions<br>
in this area as well as hotels, etc.  Plus he had similar real estate dev'ts<br>
in California, Nevada, and several other states.<br>
<p>
I heard he attended Adventist schools (FOAF stories, you know) altho<br>
never an SDA (similar to the chap who flew around the world non-stop).<br>
<p>
It would be interesting to study what Scripture and EGW have to say on<br>
what to do when money is received by church entities from questionable<br>
sources.  ADRA/Ingathering money may be a somewhat different issue, btw.<br>
<p>
I recall, when a child, going with my father to various movie moguls<br>
in India to canvas them for Uplift (as Ingathering was called there); their<br>
donations were quite generous, several thousand dollars worth of rupees.<br>
India, btw, produces far more movies than Hollywood ever dreamed of.<br>

I sure hope so...there is a lot more Biblical support for a single<br>
minister than there is for a married one with a family. In fact, <br>
Paul's statements regarding a minister and marriage are quite the<br>
reverse in that he maintains that singles are more effective.<br>
<p>
Now I'm not saying that Biblical precedents are always directly<br>
applicable - I don't believe that at all. But why has the SDA church<br>
been so reticent to ordain single guys??<br>

&lt;-----<br>
<p>
These stereotypes are necessarily bad because of what they do to the <br>
woman. Unless she can arrange things in her mind such that his calling<br>
is "their calling" and his work is "their work", and that people view<br>
them as the pastoral team rather than the pastor and his lovely wife,<br>
she is hardly going to find personal fulfilment as a woman in the late<br>
twentieth century.<br>
<p>
Some women can arrange things this way, others can't but live with it<br>
anyway. Still others have trouble with it all of their married life.<br>
<p>
soapbox on<br>
My mother pulled out of her teaching degree early when she married my<br>
father, a ministerial student at her college. After all, a minister's wife<br>
doesn't need a degree, since she is destined for a life of being a<br>
minister's wife. That was in 1966, and in 1987 Mum went back to College<br>
part time to complete her studies. <br>
<p>
This has meant a lot to her, and now she is able to work part time<br>
using the skills and abilities she has. It has improved her self-image<br>
and consequently both my parents are happier.<br>
<p>
During the intervening years she has had to live with patronizing church<br>
members, some of whom never stop relating to her as the "minister's wife"<br>
even after years in a church, when she has more than shown herself to be<br>
an individual with her own personality, abilities and needs.<br>
<p>
To me, treating a woman like the extension of a man is a remnant of a<br>
byegone era which also encompassed slavery and ignorance. The Christian<br>
church at large and the SDA church in particular should be at the forefront<br>
of changing this state of affairs, not hanging on to all the old traditions<br>
wherever it happens to be convenient.<br>
<p>
Perhaps those churches who wish to "insist on quality" in this particular<br>
way (ie two for the price of one) should start with themselves. Perhaps<br>
the congregations Steve referred to did just that.<br>
<p>
soapbox off<br>
<p>
I agree that ministers need to be special since they have to care for the<br>
needs of the church. But let's not hold standards for them that we wouldn't<br>
expect of ourselves.<br>

Sounds as if your son had the right idea; why are you<br>
frustrated by such inconsequential matters?  Is your<br>
personal sovereignty is being rubbed the wrong way?<br>

I belive part of the education of young adults for them to take more<br>
responsiblity and think about their choices involves discussing with them<br>
consequences possible actions might have.  Give them some reasons for why<br>
it is better to take one choice over another.  I think it also involve the<br>
educators providing examples.  They ought to show that they think about<br>
the consequences and are willing to admit that when they make a mistake<br>
they might not have thought things through.<br>

Well, thanks for that answer Nancy.  Given that, the interpretation that a<br>
friend of mine had must be wrong.  He saw Daniel 11:14 as talking about<br>
the Romans (the robbers) among the Jews (your people).  This clearly is<br>
wrong if the robbers are Jews.  In looking at how things are phrase I have<br>
another question:  Does the verse point to the robbers failing at<br>
determining the vision or lifting themselves up?  Or both?<br>

As an administrator in the Adventist educational system, I have<br>
naturally followed the discussion of campus rules with some interest!<br>
Let me add two points to the discussion.<br>
<p>
First, remember that most of the pressure for strict conservative<br>
standards on SDA campuses comes from the "field", i.e. church members,<br>
either directly or through conference or other church officials. School<br>
administrators don't make up endless rules because they have nothing<br>
better to do, I can assure you! It has been my experience that the very<br>
conservative people are more vocal about their "standards" than other<br>
members, for example those who would rather emphasize individual<br>
development and freedom. The remedy is more communication to school<br>
administrators from people with different views. For example, have you<br>
ever written or spoken to an SDA college president or VP for student<br>
affairs about the importance of learning to make individual choices,<br>
etc? They need to know that members have those views as well as concerns<br>
about jewelry and clothing.<br>
<p>
Second, I think we (on SDA campuses) make a mistake in defending our<br>
campus standards on strictly moral grounds. Every campus I know about<br>
has some rules or traditions that are there simply as part of the<br>
character of the institution. A school certainly has a right to try to<br>
set a tone for its campus and I think students can understand that. I<br>
don't mean to imply that no moral issues are involved, only that we make<br>
a mistake when we try to define for each individual exactly where the<br>
moral boundary is. I would much prefer, personally, to have a student on<br>
campus who is dedicated to a career of service - and who happens to wear<br>
earrings occasionally - than one who sees nothing beyond a large personal<br>
income - and conforms to all visible standards.<br>

This one hit my hot button.  Those who know me know that I don't get hot<br>
under the collar, but that I can expound at great length with intensity:<br>
<p>
[PHTH1@cc.newcastle.edu.au writes:]<br>
<i>&gt; I sure hope so...there is a lot more Biblical support for a single</i><br>
<i>&gt; minister than there is for a married one with a family. In fact, </i><br>
<i>&gt; Paul's statements regarding a minister and marriage are quite the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reverse in that he maintains that singles are more effective.</i><br>
<p>
Paul was a member of the Sanhedrin.  There is a fair amount of evidence<br>
that members had to be married.  However, his writings do not lead<br>
directly to that conclusion, IMO.  Interesting ...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But why has the SDA church been so reticent to ordain single guys??</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure it's a compelling reason, but my pastor father reckons it's<br>
to protect them.  Many times men are unaware of the wiles of treacherous<br>
women.  A wise wife can alert a husband to what she senses.  Then, there's<br>
the propriety of visiting single women (or even married women when alone);<br>
it is wise to avoid occasions that can result in a bad name (cf. principles<br>
in 2 Sam 12:14 and 1 Tim 5:14).<br>
<p>
I say "maybe not compelling" because there are alternatives (EGW has a<br>
multitude of comments on how to minister to women; the "gold" is only found<br>
by those who "dig", so I leave it as an exercise for the thoughtful reader).<br>
<p>
[Originally written by Steve Timm:]<br>
<i>&gt; The pastor with the wife</i><br>
<i>&gt; who devotes her time to helping him rather than pursuing a profession is</i><br>
<i>&gt; still thought to be desirable.</i><br>
<p>
When Christ is our Lord, we seek His will on these things.  The question<br>
is not whether people think it is desireable, but whether the Lord does.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There is still a profile of the "climber" the one who you can tell will </i><br>
<i>&gt; be a conference president in short order.</i><br>
<p>
This often imitates corporate models of behavior; Christ's model is radically<br>
different (Mark 9:35).  Jockeying, politicking for position (ever larger<br>
churches) is grievous to the Lord, I believe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are these stereotypes necessarily bad?  Are churches benefitted because</i><br>
<i>&gt; they set these high standards for their ministers?   The churches I know</i><br>
<i>&gt; who have insisted on quality haven't regretted it.</i><br>
<p>
Scripture is clear that spiritual leaders are to be held to higher<br>
standards of accountability.<br>
<p>
[Back to PHTH1:]<br>
<i>&gt; These stereotypes are necessarily bad because of what they do to the </i><br>
<i>&gt; woman. Unless she can arrange things in her mind such that his calling</i><br>
<i>&gt; is "their calling" and his work is "their work", and that people view</i><br>
<i>&gt; them as the pastoral team rather than the pastor and his lovely wife,</i><br>
<i>&gt; she is hardly going to find personal fulfilment as a woman in the late</i><br>
<i>&gt; twentieth century.</i><br>
<p>
EGW is quite clear that the call to ministry is for both husband and wife.<br>
(Some denominations even do it that way, e.g., Salvation Army ordains both.)<br>
You all may recall Dave Buxton's posting re tithe.  EGW is clear that<br>
a wife who ministers with her husband is also to be paid.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Some women can arrange things this way, others can't but live with it</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyway. Still others have trouble with it all of their married life.</i><br>
<p>
The problem is that we Christians have believed the lies that Satan propounds.<br>
The notion that a wife must work as does a husband (outside the home) to be<br>
somebody is totally and completely an invention of this world.  And the<br>
societal pressures are incredibly humongous ... which the church has done<br>
precious little to counteract (Rom 12:2).<br>
<p>
The model that Scripture (and EGW) really proposes for women and their ministry<br>
is so radically different from both the world's view and from what<br>
we seem to think Scripture says, it'll knock your socks off (1 Cor 2:9 is<br>
also broadly applicable to everthing God has in store for us, even on earth).<br>
My wife has been doing extensive reading on this matter.<br>
<p>
If you're thinking "pregnant, barefoot, and in the kitchen" you have a<br>
megasurprise coming.  Dig into it, folks!<br>
<p>
Think of this:  I get paid good money to program computers.  My programs<br>
have a shelf life of a few years before they're put out to pasture.  But<br>
when my wife and I (esp her, homeschooling mom) work to develop Godly<br>
character in our children, the results last forever.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; During the intervening years she has had to live with patronizing church</i><br>
<i>&gt; members, some of whom never stop relating to her as the "minister's wife"</i><br>
<i>&gt; even after years in a church, when she has more than shown herself to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; an individual with her own personality, abilities and needs.</i><br>
<p>
There is not a shred of Scriptural or EGW support for having a wife be<br>
in her husband's shadow.  Check out Proverbs 31.  This old stuff of<br>
"Mrs. Fred Christiansen" is totally societal in nature.  We don't really<br>
know what Scripture has to say and society is beating us up (with<br>
Satan's lies).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; SDA church in particular should be at the forefront of changing this</i><br>
<i>&gt; state of affairs, not hanging on to all the old traditions</i><br>
<i>&gt; wherever it happens to be convenient.</i><br>
<p>
Again, the goal must be to change things to God's ways, not society's<br>
(which is at enmity with God).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But let's not hold standards for them that we wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; expect of ourselves.</i><br>
<p>
Check the requirements for pastors, elders and deacons.<br>
<p>
OK, end of exposition.  May the peace of God rule in our hearts<br>
(Colossians 3:15; memorize the whole chapter, folks, it's good stuff).<br>

Paul Johnston answered the question "how can we tell the rules of the culture<br>
from what's really important" with "you can't."<br>
<p>
I'd like to propose that a different mechanism operates here.  The reason <br>
we have trouble distinguishing between the rules of the culture and the <br>
moral absolutes is that for most of our lives we have dealt with church<br>
leaders and church school administrators who claim absolute authority,<br>
argue from a position of absolute authority, and put the whole power of<br>
the church<br>
and your eternal salvation squarely on whether you wear jeans on Sabbath<br>
or not.  This view reflects a gross distortion of what scriptural<br>
authority<br>
ought to be, and unfortunately it is widely held not only by most<br>
Christians but by the fiercest enemies of Christianity  (some of whom<br>
are also Christians). <br>
<p>
The so-called conservatism of today chooses passages from inspired writings, <br>
claims verbal inspiration for them which the writings do not claim for<br>
themselves, and proceeds to declare its interpretation of those writings<br>
as the word of the LORD.  This style of interpretation is found in the<br>
various right-wing magazines named after adult undergarments, but<br>
unfortunately<br>
it is also found in the various attacks that the bureaucrats put out <br>
on these organizations, often with a much reduced level of content and<br>
even more out of context.  Even liberals and antagonists of the church<br>
fall into the trap of attacking this caricature of authority.<br>
<p>
Christ was recognized as one who taught with authority, not because of all <br>
the scripture he quoted (though he was fond of quoting it).  Rather his<br>
teachings were recognized to have authority because they made sense.  <br>
The validation of the Bible and the validation of the writings of Ellen G. <br>
White should come from the same source.  Both sets claim inspiration.<br>
Rather than *assuming* that inspiration, we should point to the results<br>
of a fulfilled Christian life as *proof* of that inspiration.  (As<br>
always, I point out that here I differ from most expositions of SDA<br>
doctrine.  SDA doctrine assumes the inspiration of the Bible as its<br>
starting point.)  We shortchange ourselves by postulating that which can<br>
be proved.<br>
<p>
The logjam of tying everything from Sabbathkeeping to hemlines to<br>
salvation was broken in the early 70's when people started preaching<br>
more salvation by faith.  But once the motive of fear of death and<br>
hell-fire was removed, many people saw no reason to do almost anything.  <br>
<p>
I propose a simple test:  "Any doctrine we believe and any actions which<br>
flow from that doctrine should enable us to better love God and love our<br>
neighbor as ourselves."  If such a quantity as lovipotential could be<br>
measured with a love-meter, and then ones' life would be altered in such<br>
a way as to maximize lovipotential, I am convinced that it must happen<br>
through the SDA way of life.<br>
<p>
Maintaining conservative standards for the sake of conservatism will<br>
eventually lead to thousands of churches with one member each. <br>
Obedience to the law of God will enable our church to become a loving<br>
machine with incredible lovipotential. <br>
(I know lovipotential isn't really a word.  If someone has a better word<br>
please let me know).<br>
<p>
It's notable but not really surprising that when I started the thread of <br>
subculture, superculture, and counterculture, almost everyone chose to <br>
focus on the subculture aspects.  The majority of this list does not live<br>
in proximity to the subculture.  Why is it that the subculture and its<br>
rules occupy such a disproportionate amount of discussion space?  It's<br>
decline and fall, after all, is a sign of the end times and something<br>
that is bound to happen, so oughtn't we to rejoice at its demise?<br>

I am confused by much of this talk about generations of believers<br>
figuring out how to beat the system while giving lip service to<br>
those in authority.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
The point here is that people shouldn't have to "beat the system".<br>
<p>
The whole idea that the church structure and educational institutions<br>
are there to exert control is the real problem. The church administration<br>
is there to serve the church, not to control it.<br>
<p>
To put this in balance, I would also say that an important role of church<br>
leaders is to provide direction for the evangelistic efforts of the<br>
worldwide church. This is supposed to make evangelism more effective than<br>
if every congregation was forced to do it independently with only their<br>
own resources to draw on.<br>
<p>
Sure, authority is needed in any school. I'm not advocating the totally<br>
lassez faire approach to education. But as long as this debate encompasses<br>
wider issues such as dress, forms of entertainment and so on, I think<br>
it is important to stay away from the idea that church administrators have<br>
"authority" in the sense that they set the standards for everyone, and that<br>
making your own decisions is bucking the system etc. etc.<br>

Hi, folks<br>
<p>
As long as we are talking subculture, I urge you to wake up and smell<br>
the coffee.  No, I mean, wake up and smell the tobacco smoke.  Or should<br>
I say wake up and smell the alcohol on the breath of our young people.<br>
I didn't want to believe the statistics until I saw it with my own eyes.<br>
But now I have seen it.  Teenagers not afraid to smoke cigarettes in the<br>
open on a church-sponsored outing.  <br>
<p>
In today's Adventist schools, the battle lines are drawn in exactly the same<br>
places as they are in any public school.  The real temptations our kids are <br>
facing are premarital sex, suicide, and substance abuse.  In some<br>
schools the faculty are still fighting the skirmishes against violations<br>
of the minor <br>
rules, but the expressions of rebellion are major and they are real.<br>
<p>
The statistics say that those SDA kids who do start drinking are 5 times<br>
more likely to become alcoholic than the general population.  I think<br>
this has largely to do with the setting up of what seems to them like so<br>
many arbitrary rules.  The solution is to be found in acting from reason<br>
and not from passion, in building a relationship of trust between<br>
rule-maker and rule-breaker.  Respect must be earned before it can be<br>
demanded.<br>
<p>

Fred:<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
This one hit my hot button.  Those who know me know that I don't get hot<br>
under the collar, but that I can expound at great length with intensity:<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
Are you hot because I upset you or because you have feelings on this<br>
topic?? This sentence got me worried initially, but I found myself<br>
agreeing with most of your reply, so I was just wondering whether<br>
there was anything about my post you objected to.<br>
<p>
I'd just like to continue discussion on a couple of points.<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
EGW is quite clear that the call to ministry is for both husband and wife.<br>
(Some denominations even do it that way, e.g., Salvation Army ordains both.)<br>
You all may recall Dave Buxton's posting re tithe.  EGW is clear that<br>
a wife who ministers with her husband is also to be paid.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
I know a lot of single guys who felt called to the ministry, went to study<br>
theology at college, met a nice girl... Do you think that he shouldn't<br>
marry her unless she feels called to ministry with him? Or that she should<br>
consider herself called because he considers himself called?<br>
<p>
How about a single girl who feels called to ministry? Should she look for<br>
a guy who himself feels called? Or should her partner consider himself<br>
called along with her?<br>
<p>
The other thing is, EGW was writing to a society quite different to our<br>
own. Now I know you say society is opposed to God's wishes...but we<br>
can't remove ourselves from society. Perhaps if women were considered<br>
more as individuals back then, her message may have been different. I<br>
agree that not all progress is progress, but I think that the sooner<br>
women are viewed as individuals in their own right the better. (This is<br>
improving, but not perfect yet.)<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
The notion that a wife must work as does a husband (outside the home) to be<br>
somebody is totally and completely an invention of this world.  And the<br>
societal pressures are incredibly humongous ... which the church has done<br>
precious little to counteract (Rom 12:2).<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
OK, but you won't find too many guys with this view who would be prepared<br>
to turn the tables and stay home themselves while their wife follows the<br>
career path. The presence of children in the family changes the equation<br>
quite a lot, but consider for a minute a couple married with no kids.<br>
<p>
In this case, I would say that the "as does a husband" phrase from the<br>
above quote is the invention. In my opinion there are many ways to serve<br>
God outside the ministry of the church, and so a person can feel led to<br>
take up a certain occupation regardless of their gender. Were I to <br>
change careers and become a minister, I would encourage my wife to <br>
continue the development of her scientific career. She is good at what<br>
she does, she makes a contribution in her field, and is a Christian<br>
witness in an otherwise largely non-Christian environment. All these<br>
things are good, for her, her colleagues, us, and the church at<br>
large.<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
Again, the goal must be to change things to God's ways, not society's<br>
(which is at enmity with God).<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
The difficulty is identifying God's ways. The way God is represented in<br>
the world has always been largely dependent on the society of the time.<br>
The chronological development in the Bible of the way God portrays himself<br>
indicates that He is behind the different models of himself, rather than<br>
the models being cooked up by mankind.<br>
<p>
Ecclesiastical authority has always been a problem for me, since so many<br>
mistakes have been made in the name of doing things "God's way". I'm not<br>
making a comment about SDA leaders or anyone in particular, but too many<br>
times in the past people have used the God's way argument to get *their*<br>
way.<br>
<p>
I think I probably agree with you, but I get confused by the number of<br>
different people who all want to do things "God's way", who all have<br>
different things in mind, and most of whom believe that God only has<br>
one way!!<br>
<p>
Tony<br>
<p>
P.S. I'd really like to meet some of you guys on the net! Let me know<br>
     if you're ever planning to visit Australia and I'll have to invite<br>
     you around for a gluten steak! Cheerio...<br>

Our esteemed moderator writes:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ...The reason  we have trouble distinguishing between the rules of </i><br>
<i>&gt; the culture and the moral absolutes is that for most of our lives </i><br>
<i>&gt; we have dealt with church leaders and church school administrators </i><br>
<i>&gt; who claim absolute authority, argue from a position of absolute </i><br>
<i>&gt; authority, and put the whole power of the church and your eternal </i><br>
<i>&gt; salvation squarely on whether you wear jeans on Sabbath or not.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; This view reflects a gross distortion of what scriptural authority</i><br>
<i>&gt; ought to be... </i><br>
<p>
Funny thing this:  These are some of the same antics that caused me to<br>
walk away from the Catholic Church.  (Substitute the Pope and the <br>
Catholic Church hierarchy for the Adventist leaders and adminstrators <br>
above.)  There is no human being on this planet that has any right to<br>
tell me what is moral and what is not, what I can or cannot do.  The<br>
simple fact that someone holds some administrative post in the Adventist<br>
Church doesn't grant them that right, nor does the collective weight of<br>
some church board.  That is the task of Scripture.  The Church can use<br>
Scripture to support it's advised standards of behavior, but cannot<br>
force me to adhere to them if I feel their logic is tenuous.  I follow<br>
precepts of the church that from personal study I can see solid Scriptural<br>
support for.  However, if church leaders expect me to follow a rule that <br>
is based on little more than an ad baculum argument, they are sadly<br>
mistaken. <br>
<p>
My attitude on "things" is simply this:  If it gets in the way of you and <br>
the Lord, get rid of it.  As I type this, I wear a wedding ring.  Yup, evil<br>
jewelry. &lt;collective gasp&gt;  Is it an act of defiance?  No, it's a way of<br>
showing others that I am married.  That way, I can carry on an intelligent<br>
and friendly conversation with a woman without her thinking that I'm on <br>
the make.  Or if a woman should think me attractive, it tells her that I'm<br>
'taken'. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Christ was recognized as one who taught with authority, not because of all </i><br>
<i>&gt; the scripture he quoted (though he was fond of quoting it).  Rather his</i><br>
<i>&gt; teachings were recognized to have authority because they made sense.  </i><br>
<p>
I used to drink alcohol occasionally.  I don't any more.  Not because the<br>
church says it's wrong, (reviewing Scripture clearly warns against getting<br>
intoxicated, but does not say anything about not taking a single drink,)<br>
but because it's just plain not good for me.  Spring water, fruit juices,<br>
and milk are, so I drink them instead.  This health message the Adventist<br>
church taught me, but didn't ram down my throat.  It "made sense."  <br>
<p>
Ah well, I've gone on long enough...<br>

<i>&gt; I am confused by much of this talk about generations of believers</i><br>
<i>&gt; figuring out how to beat the system while giving lip service to</i><br>
<i>&gt; those in authority.</i><br>
<p>
Let's talk about beating the system.<br>
<p>
There exists (last I knew) a rule at Andrews University that by default, any<br>
undergraduate student less than 22 years of age must live in the dormitory and<br>
purchase a meal plan from the cafeteria.  The only acceptable exceptions to<br>
this policy are derived from having a family member (older than 25) to live<br>
with.  A further requirement is that the family member's hospitality is<br>
uncompensated.  (Technically, you can't rent a room from your cousin.)<br>
<p>
I know of parents who have literally purchased a house in Berrien Springs,<br>
Michigan, so that their children could live outside of the dormitory.<br>
<p>
Interestingly, this restriction does not hold during the summer term.<br>
<p>
Oh--I forgot.  If you get married at age 18, you obviously don't need to live<br>
in the dorm anymore.  But if you do wish to wait for marriage until after<br>
graduation, you are required to live in the dormitory and purchase a meal<br>
plan, or until you reach age 22.  (Why 22?  They did a study and determined<br>
that by some statistical measure graduate students were of that age.)<br>
<p>
Once again I stress that fundamentally our school systems do not believe that<br>
unmarried young people are capable of living their own lives, free from<br>
oversight and control.  Until that happens these conflicts will continue.<br>
<p>

	Since we may as well be honset, here it goes.  I'm a student at the<br>
University of Illinois (Champaign-Urbana) and am quite happy with the program<br>
I'm in.  All my SDA friends have either gone to an SDA academy and/or college.<br>
I honestly considered taking a semester off and attending quarter (right?) at<br>
Andrews, taking anything that would transfer.  I thought it would be an<br>
excellent opportunity to meet people, faculty, and take a religion course.<br>
	In talking with a rescent graduate I learned of this rule.  Having been<br>
fed up living in a box and eating (sometimes gross) food, I decided that I<br>
would never live in a dorm again if I could help it.<br>
	Having learned of that rule, that option went from an "expensive<br>
alternative" to an "out of the question."  (I'm rather outspoken about this,<br>
so excuse me if I come on a little strong.)<br>
	I'm 20 years old, and I'm old enough to:<br>
Vote<br>
Die for my country<br>
Receive the death penalty<br>
Sit on a jurey<br>
Get married<br>
Be a deacon at the local church<br>
	But apparently I'm not old enough to live in my own apartment (which<br>
is where I'm writing this post right now.)  It's that rule in particular that<br>
is keeping me from attending classes there this semseter.  Those rules are<br>
not trivial, I hope people realize.<br>

Bill discusses the fact that at Andrews University single students are<br>
not permitted to live outside the dormitory etc. until age 22, and goes<br>
on to write:<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
Once again I stress that fundamentally our school systems do not believe that<br>
unmarried young people are capable of living their own lives, free from<br>
oversight and control.  Until that happens these conflicts will continue.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
At Avondale College where I recently attended there was some unwritten<br>
rule that you had to be 25 to live "outdoor", unless you were living with<br>
more-or-less immediate family.<br>
<p>
I thought this was because of the things you refer to, so when I was feeling<br>
the pinch financially at age 21 I wrote and asked permission to live with<br>
my grandparents. My stated reasons were largely that I felt I could study<br>
more efficiently and spend less time raising money as an outdoor. I was<br>
turned down.<br>
<p>
After receiving some unofficial advice from one of the college administrators<br>
I reapplied, this time stating that the reason I wished to go outdoor was<br>
to be with my grandparents. I said that due to the fact that my parents<br>
were missionaries overseas when I was a child I had never had a chance to<br>
really get to know them, and besides which Grandpa was getting old and<br>
silly and Nana needed me around the house. This time my application was<br>
approved.<br>
<p>
As it turned out, I managed to discover that the rule about not living<br>
outdoor is based almost 100% on *financial* considerations ie we can't<br>
afford to run the dorm and the caf if more than x% of our students are<br>
not using them. So I had to provide a reason to go outdoor which no-one<br>
else could use as a precedent for their own application.<br>
<p>
Interesting, huh?! Perhaps Andrews is the same...perhaps not.<br>

I'd like those who are attending public institutions of higher education to<br>
respond.  I'm preparing for my first year as an assitant professor and was<br>
surprised to receive a form letter from the Assistant Chancellor about<br>
a Wisconsin law.  According to his memo, Wisconsin law requires that the<br>
university provide "reasonable accommodation of a student's sincerely<br>
held religious beliefs with regard to all examinations and other academic<br>
requirements."  (Chapter 36.43 of Wisconsin Law).  Along with the memo was<br>
a list of various religious holy days which may preclude students from<br>
attending class or examinations by religious affiliation.  Here are the<br>
dates we as faculty were to alerted to which might conflict with student<br>
religious obversances:<br>
<p>
	September 28-29, 1992	ROSH HASHANAH (Jewish)<br>
	October 7		YOM KIPPUR (Jewish)<br>
	October 11-20		SUKKOT (Jewish)<br>
	October 20		Birth of the BAB (Baha'i)<br>
	November 12		Birth of the BAHAULLAH (Baha'i)<br>
	November 28		Ascension of ABDUL-BAHA (Baha'i)<br>
	December 20-27		HANUKKAH (Jewish)<br>
	December 25		CHRISTMAS (Christian)<br>
	February 6, 1993	TU B'SHEVAT (Jewish)<br>
	Feb 24-March 24		RAMADAN (Muslim)<br>
	March 7			PURIM (Jewish)<br>
	March 21		NEW YEAR (Baha'i)<br>
	March 25		EID AL FITR (Feast of Breaking Fast at the<br>
					end of Ramadan) (Muslim)<br>
	April 6-13		PASSOVER (Jewish)<br>
	April 9			GOOD FRIDAY (Christian)<br>
	April 11		EASTER (Christian)<br>
	April 21		RIDZAN (Baha'i)<br>
	May 23			Declaration of the BAB (Baha'i)<br>
	May 26-27		SHAVUOTH (Jewish)<br>
	June 1			EID AL ADHA/Feast of Sacrifice (Muslim)<br>
<p>
It was noted that many of these holy days "make it impossible for students<br>
to attend the University or do any type of school work."  Others were<br>
annotated that "Although work on this day is permitted, observance would<br>
make one unavailable to attend the University in the evening or morning, or<br>
during religious services, or to prepare any assignments during this time."<br>
"All Jewish holidays begin the evening before the calendar day."  "Shabbat<br>
is observed every Saturday, and no manner of University work or attendance<br>
would be allowed."<br>
<p>
Most obvious to SDAs is not mention that SDAs would not be available to<br>
attend University classes or do University assignments.  More importantly,<br>
not a single note of Sunday observance for ANY RELIGION<br>
<p>
Now my questions.  Do other state universities have such a policy or law?<br>
What degree of accomodation you required to make for student religious<br>
observance?  Are faculty and staff given the same liberties as students?<br>
<p>
Why do you think Sunday observance is totally missing from the list?  Is<br>
it because so few churches really keep Sunday according to the 4th commandment?<br>
(In other words, Sunday observance by abstaining from work or university<br>
studying is not professed by most denominations).<br>
<p>
BTW.  You won't find me giving an exam or having an assignment due on<br>
December 25!<br>
<p>
This is quite a list!  Just about every week in the academic year has some<br>
religious holiday.<br>

At Carnegie Mellon there is a similar policy, although I have never had <br>
a student claim the Bahai holidays as yet.  But there is a large Jewish <br>
community and every year around Passover and High Holy Days a lot of <br>
students disappear.  I had never heard of the Jewish holiday of Shavuoth<br>
until there was quite a hullaballoo last year because CMU's graduation<br>
was scheduled on that day.  The graduation service was not moved<br>
but special arrangements were made for those who could not participate.<br>
<p>
Sometimes I wonder if we are willing to give in our SDA institutions the <br>
same religious freedom that we demand on secular campuses.  The problems<br>
of examinations scheduled on Sunday were frequently encountered by non-SDA<br>
students at Andrews.  Some teachers were accomodating, others were not.<br>
Can we reasonably expect to obtain freedoms which we do not give to others?<br>

<i>&gt; The whole idea that the church structure and educational institutions</i><br>
<i>&gt; are there to exert control is the real problem. The church administration</i><br>
<i>&gt; is there to serve the church, not to control it.</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately, people often look to institutions and leaders for guidance<br>
as a substitute for looking to Scripture (2 Tim 3:16) and the Holy Spirit<br>
(John 16:13) (not that you never seek counsel from Godly people (Prov 13:20;<br>
Prov 11:14), but that you go to the Source foremost).  For example, at the<br>
last GC, a request from some Europeans was for a set of do's and don't's for<br>
Sabbath activities (cf. the proceedings in the Review) (many Americans have<br>
trouble with what Europeans do on Sabbath, you see.  Having spent time in<br>
Europe, I sorta see, but want to be mindful of Matt 7:3-5.).  I think this<br>
is an example of what contributes in a demand-pull fashion towards the<br>
establishment of hierarchic structures larger than Scripture's model<br>
(which my reading suggests as God-&gt;patriarch-&gt;household and<br>
prophet/priest-&gt;father-&gt;family for authority, leadership, and instruction).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To put this in balance, I would also say that an important role of church</i><br>
<i>&gt; leaders is to provide direction for the evangelistic efforts of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; worldwide church. This is supposed to make evangelism more effective than</i><br>
<i>&gt; if every congregation was forced to do it independently with only their</i><br>
<i>&gt; own resources to draw on.</i><br>
<p>
Good point.  An additional observation:<br>
<p>
 From my wife's and my readings recently in Scripture and EGW testimonies and<br>
counsels, we've learned a few things:  Pastors are to work more as evangelists,<br>
visiting house to house and holding meetings.  Men work primarily with men,<br>
women with women, husband-wife teams with families.  Elders ("bishops" in<br>
Scripture) and deacons (and their spouses) are to take on the major part<br>
of ministering to the spiritual and physical needs of the congregation,<br>
visiting members, counseling, praying with, taking food to, doing repairs<br>
around the house for widows, etc.<br>
<p>
Kinda different from current practice, eh?<br>

<i>&gt; In some schools the faculty are still fighting the skirmishes against</i><br>
<i>&gt; violations of the minor rules, but the expressions of rebellion are</i><br>
<i>&gt; major and they are real.</i><br>
<p>
What produces rebellion?  Schools are not they only problem area; I can<br>
see a number of other failure points:<br>
<p>
Parents who fail to teach their children how to develop a personal<br>
  relationship with the Lord, including a personal devotional life (Deut 6:7).<br>
Parents who lack self-control, are un-Christ-like (Phil 2:5; 1 Pet 4:1), thus<br>
  communicating a lousy image of Father-God.<br>
Parents in whom the fruits of the Spirit are sadly and chronically lacking,<br>
  whose lives are a spiritual wasteland, lacking spiritual growth.<br>
Parents who just bark out orders and do not teach principles (too often,<br>
  because that's how they were brought up).<br>
Parents who abdicate their spiritual responsibilities, assuming that the<br>
  church and the church school (institutions) will take up the slack.<br>
Parents who feel their children can do no wrong (Prov 24:24).<br>
Parents who assert that their children are always wrong, even indirectly;<br>
  who do not confess their own failings (Eph 6:4, Col 3:21; James 5:16).<br>
Parents who fail to see that the great controversy occurs on an individual<br>
  level, who figure they can just muddle long, who do not see Satan out<br>
  to destroy their children (Isa 49:25).<br>
Parents who "sacrifice" their children on the altar of convenience,<br>
  a certain standard of living, personal aggrandizement, self-serving, etc.<br>
Parents who think you can be Christian and still of the world (2 Cor 6:17,<br>
  Josh 3:5; 1 Pet 2:9).<br>
Parents whose lives are not a demonstration of a victorious Christian life<br>
  ("rather see a sermon than hear one any day", "if it's not working for<br>
  you, it ain't real").<br>
<p>
Churches that teach doctrine ("what") but not spiritual disciplines ("how").<br>
Blind guides.<br>
<p>
Not exhaustive.  But I want to make the point that parents are very<br>
important (altho God is not limited; see Ps 27:10).  I have a theory<br>
and that is that the old statistics of how more kids stay SDA if they<br>
go to church schools .. has a lot less to do with church schools and<br>
a lot more to do with parents and how the children were raised.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; this has largely to do with the setting up of what seems to them like so</i><br>
<i>&gt; many arbitrary rules.  The solution is to be found in acting from reason</i><br>
<i>&gt; and not from passion, in building a relationship of trust between</i><br>
<i>&gt; rule-maker and rule-breaker.  Respect must be earned before it can be</i><br>

<i>&gt; Are you hot because I upset you or because you have feelings on this topic??</i><br>
<p>
Not hot as in "hot under the collar", but "hot button" as in "motivated me<br>
strongly to respond".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I know a lot of single guys who felt called to the ministry, went to study</i><br>
<i>&gt; theology at college, met a nice girl... [1] Do you think that he shouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; marry her unless she feels called to ministry with him? [2] Or that she</i><br>
<i>&gt; should consider herself called because he considers himself called?</i><br>
<p>
[1] Several pastoral dropouts/divorces with whom I am personally acquainted<br>
    (as well as several indirectly) dropped out/divorced because of tensions<br>
    as the wife discovered she did not like being a pastor's wife.  Granted,<br>
    some pressures resulted from expectations (husband's, congregation's,<br>
    in-law's) which are probably not God's, but some do just come with the<br>
    territory.  My readings suggest that God has grand vistas of opportunity<br>
    for ministry by a husband-wife pastoral team (moderated, of course,<br>
    by ages of the children, if any).  I don't quite have the temerity to<br>
    suggest that all should be this way, but I believe God would be<br>
    delighted to have more than there are.<br>
<p>
    p.s.  I think there's something fundamentally flawed with the system<br>
    when so many mothers *have* to work in order to send the kids the<br>
    church school.  God has solutions if we'll seek for them.<br>
<p>
[2] Mary was called directly to what God hand in mind; Joseph's came<br>
    afterward.  However, we don't know how it was for Zipporah.  Anyway,<br>
    marriage is always a big (and supposed to be permanent) step.<br>
    The young woman should be very certain of God's leading.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How about a single girl who feels called to ministry? Should she look for</i><br>
<i>&gt; a guy who himself feels called? Or should her partner consider himself</i><br>
<i>&gt; called along with her?</i><br>
<p>
I can't answer this one because I'm unclear as to where God is on women<br>
pastor-shepherds.  If, in fact, God is OK on women pastors, then I think<br>
we need to be careful on how it transpires.  God's name is being dishonored<br>
by the feminist political tactics being used by those agitating and pressuring;<br>
if they win, it gives credence to the "arm of man".  Far better for God's<br>
cause if we heed's Gamaliel's advice (Acts 5:38,39).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In my opinion there are many ways to serve</i><br>
<i>&gt; God outside the ministry of the church, and so a person can feel led to</i><br>
<i>&gt; take up a certain occupation regardless of their gender.</i><br>
<p>
In general, certainly.  But what is God's best for pastors, both individually<br>
and collectively?  For those contemplating pastoral ministry, that is worth<br>
studying.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The difficulty is identifying God's ways.</i><br>
<p>
We seem to have difficulty, aye!  But God has a method:  Deut 4:9,29, 5:29,<br>
6:5, 10:12, 30:6,10; Josh 22:5; 1 Sam 12:20; 1 Kings 2:4, 8:58; 1 Chr 28:9;<br>
2 Chr 6:14, 7:14, 15:12,15, 16:9; Ps 62:8, 119:10,34; Prov 3:5;<br>
Jer 24:7, 29:13; Ez 18:31; Joel 2:12.  Also, study the lives of the patriarchs.<br>

<i>&gt;From: cheryl berthelsen &lt;cherylb@csd4.csd.uwm.edu&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now my questions.  Do other state universities have such a policy or law?</i><br>
<i>&gt;What degree of accomodation you required to make for student religious</i><br>
<i>&gt;observance?  Are faculty and staff given the same liberties as students?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why do you think Sunday observance is totally missing from the list?  Is</i><br>
<i>&gt;it because so few churches really keep Sunday according to the 4th commandment?</i><br>
<i>&gt;(In other words, Sunday observance by abstaining from work or university</i><br>
<i>&gt;studying is not professed by most denominations).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Not ever having been a member of the staff, I can see how goofy it<br>
all looks. As an SDA on a public school campus a few years ago<br>
(I can't believe I'm saying that!) at Champaign, the U of I has<br>
such a policy, esp for exams. Having not exercised the policy<br>
myself, I know of a few SDAs who did use religious observance<br>
as a reason to back out of a Saturday exam, and the profs allowed<br>
it. It's a judgment call for the prof to make, so you'll have<br>
to be as reasonable as possible.<br>
<p>
As far as Sunday goes, no school in their right mind would officially<br>
hold a class on Sunday. Nothing stops them from holding it at all on<br>
a Sunday, but it just isn't done officially. <br>
<p>
The way the school sees it, giving Sunday off is to give everyone<br>
a mandated break from work and classes. What you do w/ that day<br>
is your problem as far as the school is concerned. It seems to have<br>
nothing to do with religious observance, but its roots are clearly<br>
religious, to make sure those students are at 11 am service, sober<br>
or otherwise.<br>
<p>
Besides, the school makes sure exams don't fall on Dec 25 by giving <br>
us all winter break. Aren't these guys clever? :)<br>

<i>&gt;    church school.  God has solutions if we'll seek for them.</i><br>
<p>
There are other plans out there.  My father works at a Junior academy where the<br>
'All member plan' is used.  All children in a particular church are supported<br>
tuition-wise by the church.  Each member is asked to contribute to this support,<br>
(particularly those who have children attending, but all as well, as we are all<br>
a church family!).  This is a relatively new plan, and it is hard to get complete<br>
support for, but it has reaped good results so far.  For example, a couple <br>
single parents have been able to enroll their children in the SDA school.<br>
How long it will fly largely depends on the support of the congregation, but, <br>
for what it's worth, this is an alternative...<br>

<i>&gt; Sometimes I wonder if we are willing to give in our SDA institutions the </i><br>
<i>&gt; same religious freedom that we demand on secular campuses.  The problems</i><br>

<i>&gt; Can we reasonably expect to obtain freedoms which we do not give to others?</i><br>
<p>
Very good point.  Two observations:<br>
1) About 11 years ago, the church school of the church I was attending had<br>
   several students who were World-wide Church of God.  They kept several<br>
   religious holidays which Christians have not historically kept.  The<br>
   teacher and the church were slightly taken aback but then upon reflection<br>
   accomodated.  (Unfortunately, that church was not always that reasonable.)<br>
2) Most of the construction subcontractors I am currently working with are<br>
   Mormon.  I have requested that they not work on my house on my Sabbath,<br>
   and that I do not expect them to work on their "Sabbath".  It's a two-way<br>
   street.<br>

<p>
There were only 4 religions on the list: Jewish, Christian, Moslem, Bahai.<br>
It is therefore not in the least surprising that sabbath-observing christians<br>
are not mentioned, the list is obviously dealing with mainstream interpretations<br>
of these 4 religions.<br>

<p>
My first thought was that Sunday is so obviously a day off in Christian nations<br>
that there was no need to spell it out. Believers can use the day off to<br>
follow their spiritual endeavours, and others can just take it easy and<br>
recover from the weekend.<br>
<p>
My second thought was that this was probably not the case. More probably<br>
there was no mention of Sunday observance because anybody can go to church<br>
if they want to, and just make time on Sunday if anything else needs doing.<br>
<p>
Also, I don't remember seeing Friday being mentioned as a special day for<br>
moslems. Maybe I got this wrong, but I thought this was their holy day (?).<br>

<p>
I read with interest, Bob Moynihan's response to rules and culture.<br>
Idealistically I think a church has the right to expect its members to<br>
follow their biblical teachings. However, the rub comes when each<br>
denomination has it own traditions.<br>
<p>
We could carry the attitude that no one has a right to tell me what is<br>
moral to immoral extremes. The judge in Fla. reviewed the album of 2 Live<br>
Crew. As you may recall the title of the Album was "As Nasty as They<br>
Wanna Be." He declared it to be obscene and illegal. However, Dan Rather<br>
on "48 Hours" made some outlandish statements about our loss of freedoms.<br>
<p>
Geraldo Riviera had the singing group on his show. Phil Donahue and his<br>
cronies in the press threw their usual temper tantrums when the news broke<br>
and cried, "Censorship" from the roof tops.<br>
<p>
It is interesting to note that no one mentioned the lyrics!! Why? Probably<br>
because adults would be shocked and outraged by their filth and<br>
debauchery. What were the words:<br>
<p>
226 uses of the "F" word<br>
117 explicit terms for genitalia<br>
87 descriptions of oral sex<br>
163 usues of the word for the female dog<br>
15 uses of the word "Ho" (slang for whore)<br>
81 uses of the "S" word.<br>
<p>
Should we say the 2 Live Crew has the right to express themselves this<br>
way?<br>

[Fred writes]<br>
<i>&gt; Scripture is clear that spiritual leaders are to be held to higher</i><br>
<i>&gt; standards of accountability.</i><br>
<p>
AMEN!  See 1 &amp; 2 Timothy and Titus.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; There is not a shred of Scriptural or EGW support for having a wife be</i><br>
<i>&gt; in her husband's shadow.  Check out Proverbs 31.  This old stuff of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Mrs. Fred Christiansen" is totally societal in nature.  We don't really</i><br>
<i>&gt; know what Scripture has to say and society is beating us up (with</i><br>
<i>&gt; Satan's lies).</i><br>
<p>
Some pages must have fallen from your Bible, Fred.  Here, let me<br>
share with you.<br>
<p>
How about Psalm 17:7-9.<br>
  7 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by<br>
thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those<br>
that rise up against them.<br>
  8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of<br>
thy wings,<br>
  9 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who<br>
compass me about.<br>
<p>
Or maybe Psalm 63:7-8.<br>
  7 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of<br>
thy wings will I rejoice.<br>
  8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.<br>
<p>
Now, I know that in context, these verses speak about the relation-<br>
ship between man and God, but under the light of the first twelve<br>
verses of 1st Corinthians, I think they can be applied to the<br>
husband-wife relationship.  If you don't agree, let me give you<br>
one more Scripture.<br>
<p>
Song of Solomon 2:3-4.<br>
  3 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my<br>
beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great<br>
delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.<br>
  4 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over<br>
me was love.<br>
<p>
Notice that this is NOT the shadow of death, travail, or judgment,<br>
as some who have not learned the peace of submission view it.<br>
Rather, it is the shadow of protection, peace, rejoicing, delight,<br>
and LOVE.  My mother-in-law, a widow for more than fifteen years,<br>
continues to conduct her business as Mrs. John F. Kling.  She<br>
views it as part of God's protection of her.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; OK, end of exposition.  May the peace of God rule in our hearts</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Colossians 3:15; memorize the whole chapter, folks, it's good stuff).</i><br>
<p>
Amen, amen.  How about verses 18-19?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Fred Christiansen</i><br>

The "all member plan" described by Lisa is just like the "Temple plan" the<br>
SDA church tried back in the 60's.  The idea was "sold" to the church because<br>
the tuition money is given to the church, the church pays the money to the<br>
school, and the parents can deduct the money from the income tax.  Our church<br>
had a real problem after the 2nd month.  There were many "dead beat" families<br>
who paid nothing but sent their kids to church school anyway, older members<br>
didn't contribute because "they already put their own kids through school."<br>
The plan collapsed under the financial burden of paying the school for kids<br>
attending with no money coming into the church to pay for it.  It was a<br>
financial nightmare for the local SDA church.<br>

In an interesting feature I read not long ago, I read that Luther<br>
Campbell, the lead "singer" for 2 Live Crew, doesn't allow his young<br>
daughters to listen to the music his group puts out, and believes that<br>
his music should not be heard by young children.<br>
<p>
This of course, does not change the fact that it indeed is heard by many<br>
young children, and making it a banned substance only makes kids more eager.  <br>

<i>&gt;1) About 11 years ago, the church school of the church I was attending had</i><br>
<i>&gt;   several students who were World-wide Church of God.  They kept several</i><br>
<i>&gt;   religious holidays which Christians have not historically kept.  The</i><br>

<i>&gt;   accomodated.</i><br>
<p>
As a member of the WCoG I would question your comment that we observe <br>
religious holidays which Christians have not historically kept. I quote<br>
from our official Statement of Beliefs:<br>
<p>
THE FESTIVALS<br>
  The observance of the festivals and holy days enjoined on ancient<br>
  Israel was affirmed by the example of Jesus Christ and the apostles.<br>
  They are holy convocations, memorials of God's great acts of<br>
  salvation in history, symbols of the power of God, and types of the<br>
  anticipated future fulfillment of God's plan of salvation.  For the<br>
  Christian, the festivals and holy days are annual celebrations of<br>
  God's power, love, and saving grace.<br>
  (Leviticus 23:1-2, John 4:45, 5:1, 7:37, 12:12, Acts 20:16,<br>
  I Corinthians 5:7-8)<br>
 <br>
Historically, the early Church did observe these Festivals (Passover, the<br>
Days of Unleavened Bread, Pentecost, Atonement, and Tabernacles) - the<br>
references in Acts and elsewhere make this clear. Further, there is evidence<br>
that other Christians down through history observed these too, though they<br>
were often shunned and persecuted as Judaizers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  (Unfortunately, that church was not always that reasonable.)</i><br>
<p>
We try to be reasonable :-)! We hold these annual festivals with the same<br>
regard as the weekly Sabbath. Further, we do not observe religious festivals <br>
of non-Biblical origin (eg. Easter, Christmas). Perhaps a misunderstanding<br>
arose and this was perceived as unreasonableness on our part?<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
<p>
Drew Corrigan.<br>
<p>
PS. My Bible does have Colossians 2:16-18, Galatians, etc, just in case<br>
    you're wondering :-)!<br>

Steve, <br>
<p>
I was wondering if you have compiled any demographics on the sdanet list<br>
which you would be willing to share with the subscribers.<br>
<p>
Any kinds of information would be of interest, but even just general things<br>
would be good. eg<br>
<p>
number of subscribers<br>
percentage of males &amp; females<br>
age statistics<br>
employment  (how many work in "the work")<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
Tony<br>
<p>
[I compiled such things in the past, but it's quite out of date.  <br>
I should compile it again.  It's difficult because for some people<br>
I only have a nondescript computer account number.  People who I <br>
thought to be SDA for months have sometimes turned out not to be so.<br>
So I will soon be sending out the revised and updated directory.<br>
Anyone who has joined the list since May, please send me mail to <br>
tell me who and where you are and what you do, if you don't think I know.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;In an interesting feature I read not long ago, I read that Luther</i><br>
<i>&gt;Campbell, the lead "singer" for 2 Live Crew, doesn't allow his young</i><br>
<i>&gt;daughters to listen to the music his group puts out, and believes that</i><br>
<i>&gt;this music should not be heard by young children.</i><br>
<p>
It's too bad that he sings it then.  And, doesn't this speak to what many<br>
today really believe?  It's okay, but, not MY family?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This of course, does not change the fact that it indeed is heard by many</i><br>
<i>&gt;young children, and making it a banned substance only makes kids more eager.  </i><br>
<p>
I can remember some of the rebellion from my youth (although it has been quite<br>
a while - maybe it just seems like it....:-)  How can we tell our youth that <br>
the banned substances are there for a reason.  Not just to make them suffer and<br>
not have what we are indulging.  <br>
<p>
Any ideas out there (I know that there are!)<br>

I would like to make a light hearted comment about wedding rings.  My<br>
experience is that most single men can't remember which finger it is<br>
supposed to be on anyway.  Plus there are often other rings on nearby<br>
fingers to confuse the picture.  In addition, you have to reflect<br>
everything through the vertical axis and remember ``Let's see - her<br>
left hand is on my right now''.  Of course, all the while you are<br>
supposed to be carrying on a conversation and objects can get in the<br>
way of the critical finger -- what was that you said, again -- and<br>
it's not polite to stare at her hand.  Then, I think that in Europe<br>
the ring finger is not the same as here, but I have trouble<br>
remembering which one it is anyway.  Is it really forbidden to wear<br>
another ring on the wedding ring finger?  So I think that the value of<br>
wedding rings for showing your marital status is highly overrated.<br>
<p>
What I do at work is to have a picture of my wife and children on my<br>
desk, to show I am married.  It's also helpful to mention your wife<br>
and children in conversation if you think someone may be getting the<br>
wrong idea.  That goes for both men and women.  When I met my wife,<br>
one of my first questions was, Are you married?  That's a good way to<br>
get someone's attention, by the way!<br>
<p>
I think that one unfortunate result of wearing wedding rings is that<br>
it introduces too great a distinction between the married and single<br>
status.  In Christ, there is no male or female etc. -- no married or<br>
single, either.  For those who are single and would like to be<br>
married, the ring is a constant reminder of their status, and an<br>
unwelcome one, I think (at least, if they can remember which finger it<br>
is on ... ).  I think one reason some ladies wear rings is that they<br>
wish they had a wedding ring and it's as close as they can get.<br>
<p>
We went to Europe as a married couple with children, not wearing<br>
wedding rings, and stayed in hotels and never had trouble.  I<br>
sometimes wonder if a wedding ring is still as necessary in Europe as<br>
it was in Ellen White's day.  Of course, maybe the people just assumed<br>
we were crazy Americans.<br>
<p>
One good result of not wearing a wedding ring or (other?) jewelry is<br>
that some people may be impressed.  I read at least one mission story<br>
where a man noticed how simply and naturally a lady was dressed and<br>
began to wonder what was different about her.  Through this experience<br>
he became introduced to the Lord and the Seventh-day Adventist Church.<br>
On our recent trip to Europe we witnessed to a considerable extent to<br>
two people, both of whom asked why we were vegetarians.  I think the<br>
same thing can happen when our style of dress is simple and natural.<br>

To the network:<br>
<p>
I believe that rebels are created as a result of multitudes of rules<br>
without proper foundation.  A good example is the story of the Prodigal<br>
son in Luke 15. The one son rebelled against it. The other son could not<br>
see or understand what was happening when his brother returned because he<br>
had kept all the "rules."<br>
<p>
Dwight Nelson, senior pastor at Andrews University has an excellent<br>
sermon/talk on this very subject. <br>

A case of mistaken antecedent here.  By "that church" I was referring to<br>
the SDA church I attended at the time in Minnesota.  It had a number of<br>
hard-nosed Norwegians who tho't it needful, e.g., to openly rebuke a newly<br>
baptized member, on a hot summer Sabbath, regarding the fact that her dress<br>
was sleeveless.  The same ones refused a mother permission to interpret<br>

Has anyone heard of a man by the name of Frank Skittel?  He has recently <br>
come to Pennsylvania and proceeded to wreak havoc in several SDA churches,<br>
evidently he was recently from Oklahoma.  I'm not at liberty to disclose <br>
all the details, but he is evidently connected with some type of holy-flesh<br>
theology.<br>
<p>
When the matter becomes more public here I will give more details.  Until<br>
then, if anyone has any background, I would much appreciate it.<br>

Yes, Alas! for the Tempter makes all "forbidden fruit" extremely attractive.<br>

  A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.  For she<br>

Sanctification is (at least), by God's miracle of grace, having our<br>
tastes/wants for ungodly things (James 1:14) be changed to tastes/wants<br>
for God's best (Ps 24:3,4; 51:1-19; 119:9-11; Col 3:10).<br>

<i>&gt; From my wife's and my readings recently in Scripture and EGW testimonies and</i><br>
<i>&gt; counsels, we've learned a few things: Pastors are to work more as evangelists,</i><br>
<i>&gt; visiting house to house and holding meetings.  Men work primarily with men,</i><br>
<i>&gt; women with women, husband-wife teams with families.  Elders ("bishops" in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Scripture) and deacons (and their spouses) are to take on the major part</i><br>
<i>&gt; of ministering to the spiritual and physical needs of the congregation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; visiting members, counseling, praying with, taking food to, doing repairs</i><br>
<i>&gt; around the house for widows, etc.</i><br>
<p>
I've been requested to cite references for the above.  In Scripture, I'm<br>
thinking of the first deacons (and why they were chosen, Acts 6:4 and its<br>
context), esp Stephen, Paul's advise to Timothy and Titus, and how Paul<br>
worked (Acts 20:18-20).  For EGW, we've been reading in "Testimonies to<br>
Ministers and Gospel Workders", see for example pp. 305-318.  I have<br>
extrapolated somewhat, above, but I hope in the right spirit.<br>

<p>
Steve, you are right we need to accomadate Sunday worshippers when even<br>
we can.<br>
<p>
I have gone to "bat" for Sunday ministers when the local high school was<br>
having some activity on Sunday mornings. The problem was solved with the<br>
principal of the school and the Sunday ministers were very appreciative of<br>
my efforts. The reason I did it and not one of them was that I was the<br>
president of the  ministerial assoc.<br>
<p>
Sometimes we miss the real issue in the Sabbath/Sunday controversy. When<br>
this issue comes up our attention is immediately turned to the<br>
Sunday-keeping Christians versus the Sabbath-keeping (Saturday)<br>
Christians. This is not the issue. <br>
<p>
Many Sunday keeping Christians are resting fully in Christ for their<br>
salvation; they are keeping Sunday for the right reason. Likewise there<br>
are many Saturday keeping Christians who believe that their<br>
Sabbath-keeping will save them; they are keeping the Sabbath for the<br>
wrong reason.<br>
<p>
The real issue in the Sabbath/Sunday controversy is the age long<br>
controversy between salvation by works versus salvation by faith.<br>
This controversy will reach its climax in these last days.<br>
<p>
When Adam and Eve turned from God dependence to self dependence, at the<br>
fall, they had to eat their bread "by the sweat of their face." (Gen.<br>
3:19). As a result of this, a man-made rest day had to be established,<br>
and Sunday became that day. But unlike God's Sabbath, man's rest day does<br>
not point to a perfect finished work. Today Sunday is the international<br>
day of rest from man's work. Since all mankind was also created a<br>
spiritual being, his departure from God's dependence to self dependence<br>
also meant a departure from God worship to self worship: Rom. 1:18-32;<br>
Isa. 53:6; Phil 2:21. <br>
<p>
The bottom line is:  salvation by faith in God's grace.( Eph 2:8,9; Titus<br>
3:5). At the heart of every man-made religion is salvation by works. Rom.<br>
9:30-32; 10:1-3; Gal. 3:1-3,10. Those who submit to salvation by grace<br>
enter into God's rest, symbolized in the bible by the Sabbath.<br>
<p>
Those who insist on saving themselves by works enter man's rest which will<br>
be symbolized in the last days by Sunday keeping. These two alternate<br>
ways of salvation have been in conflict ever since Cain killed Abel. This<br>
conflict will culminate in the war of Armageddon when those who have<br>
willfully and ultimately rejected the gospel of grace will persecute<br>
those who are resting entirely in God's redemption in Christ.<br>
<p>
My basic concern is with and for 7th-day Adventists who still are<br>
clinging on to salvation by works. My concern is that according to<br>
scripture they do not have a prayer beyond this world. And it really is a<br>
pity because they do not have the assurance of salvation as John talks<br>
about it in 1 John 5:13 and onward. Those of us who are Adventists here on<br>
the net need to pray and work for these mis-guided church members.<br>
<p>
...........more later,....................Paul<br>

<i>&gt; [Fred writes]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; There is not a shred of Scriptural or EGW support for having a wife be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in her husband's shadow.  Check out Proverbs 31.  This old stuff of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "Mrs. Fred Christiansen" is totally societal in nature.  We don't really</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; know what Scripture has to say and society is beating us up (with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Satan's lies).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some pages must have fallen from your Bible, Fred.  Here, let me</i><br>
<i>&gt; share with you.  [Psalm 17:7-9; Psalm 63:7-8; Song of Solomon 2:3-4]</i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, I know that in context, these verses speak about the relation-</i><br>
<i>&gt; ship between man and God, but under the light of the first twelve</i><br>
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
<i>&gt; verses of 1st Corinthians, I think they can be applied to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; husband-wife relationship.</i><br>
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
Agreed!  The shadow/wings metaphor is delightful.  Cf. Matt 23:37, Luke 13:34,<br>
Ruth 3.  It is also a challenge:  "When a mother (hen) says Cluck! Cluck!<br>
Who comes running?  All her baby chicks come running!" goes the song.<br>
Now, let's ask ourselves:  When Christ calls us, do we come running, ready<br>
to do whatever He asks of us?<br>
<p>
The "shadow" I was referring to was the shadow of anonymity, wherein the<br>
personality of the wife is buried as an almost non-entity.  I believe I have<br>
the support of Scripture (Proverbs 31) for a wife who is a distinct person,<br>
yet in no way willful, rebellious, or of an independent spirit (1 Pet 3:4).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Rather, it is the shadow of protection, peace, rejoicing, delight,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and LOVE.  My mother-in-law, a widow for more than fifteen years,</i><br>
<i>&gt; continues to conduct her business as Mrs. John F. Kling.  She</i><br>
<i>&gt; views it as part of God's protection of her.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, a husband is to be an "umbrella of loving protection" for his wife and<br>
family.  And a wife is to put herself under that umbrella (Eph 5, Col 3),<br>
be under his authority (1 Pet 3:6), know how to appeal, and when to go over<br>
his head (Ps 50:15).  The husband's love is to be as Christ's, even laying<br>
down his life for her protection.<br>
<p>
As to your mother-in-law:  There's a measure of conviction for me there.<br>
I'm willing to back down from my 1st para above re the use of husband's name.<br>
I think we're in synch on the rest after my expanded comments herein.<br>

this is a most appropriate situation.<br>

<p>
Before ceasing to post on this topic, I would just like to say what<br>
I have gained from the discussion.<br>
<p>
I had never really investigated the issue of Christian perfection at<br>
all before. I suppose the issues which are closest to me are ones to<br>
do with the relationship of religion and science, and things to do with<br>
music. The views represented by Ruben have only ever been given to me<br>
by people who don't believe things are that way.<br>
<p>
Initially I was surprised by the number of texts Ruben managed to produce<br>
which seemed to back up his view. This motivated me to start to investigate<br>
the issue for myself. I found myself in an awkward position where, on the<br>
one hand, I could not back up my own understanding in the face of the<br>
evidence Ruben presented. On the other hand, I found the views he was<br>
promoting untenable in that I felt they contradicted the core of Jesus'<br>
gospel.<br>
<p>
At present I am in the process of trying to resolve the situation for<br>
myself. I have purchased some books, both EGW books I didn't have and<br>
some others, and am reading them when I can. I have also spoken to my<br>
church pastor regarding the issue, and a couple of other people. Things<br>
are starting to come together, albeit slowly.<br>
<p>
I never intended to get caught up in a discussion/argument/whatever on the<br>
net, partly because I don't know how many other people would benefit from<br>
it (someone said this was all deja vu on the net), and partly because I don't<br>
have a well-considered opinion on the topic. I do, however, have a well-<br>
considered opinion on the way of approach that says "here is the one and<br>
only way to view this doctrinal issue", and it was this that eventually<br>
motivated me to post some replies.<br>
<p>
I would be interested to know what the overall "feeling" was last time<br>
this issue was discussed. Was there one view which seemed to be held by<br>
most people, or was it impossible to tell?<br>
<p>
Cheryl may be right about people "not budging an inch" as a result of<br>
doctrinal discussions. For myself, I know that I have been motivated to<br>
study and pray more than I have for quite some time, so I feel that<br>
I have gained from the experience!<br>
<p>

God has been moving mightily in the Pittsburgh area recently.  Within<br>
the last few months a sizable group of Spanish-speaking believers has<br>
grown<br>
within our church and we will soon begin a weekly Spanish service for them.<br>
Given Pittsburgh's almost negligible Hispanic population, this is quite<br>
an occurence.  The pastor and I are among the majority of the church members<br>
who don't speak Spanish.  <br>
<p>
SDAnet has heard before of my experience in South Africa when I prayed for <br>
the gift of tongues to learn Afrikaans, and succeeded in learning the<br>
language quickly, albeit not without study.<br>
<p>
Is this another appropriate place to pray for the gift of tongues?  Or<br>
should I, and the congregation at large, be content with the spiritual<br>
gifts we have already been given?<br>
<p>
Do people really feel that tongues, miracles, and prophecy will be <br>
part of the latter rain, or are we holding up our umbrellas for <br>
protection against it?<br>
<p>
This is an area in which I am searching myself and welcome the input<br>
from the net, from whichever direction it may come.<br>

<i>&gt; SDAnet has heard before of my experience in South Africa when I prayed for </i><br>
<i>&gt; the gift of tongues to learn Afrikaans, and succeeded in learning the</i><br>
<i>&gt; language quickly, albeit not without study.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is this another appropriate place to pray for the gift of tongues?  Or</i><br>
<i>&gt; should I, and the congregation at large, be content with the spiritual</i><br>
<i>&gt; gifts we have already been given?</i><br>
<p>
Some *are* given the gift of tongues already...but I doubt if it would<br>
be unreasonable to ask for it.  I remember a summer spent colporteuring<br>
around Salinas, CA when the Spanish that I had studied in academy and<br>
college just seemed to click.  (Odd that it didn't work so well when I<br>
finished work that summer and went back to school.)<br>
<p>
I've been blessed by attending our hispanic congregation's services<br>
(although it gets harder as I get "volunteered" to teach more at our<br>
english-language congregation), although I read much better than I<br>
understand spoken Spanish.  Well, I can follow some better than others.<br>
Good thing for me that there aren't any Cubans in the group.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do people really feel that tongues, miracles, and prophecy will be </i><br>
<i>&gt; part of the latter rain, or are we holding up our umbrellas for </i><br>
<i>&gt; protection against it?</i><br>
<p>
I think that some may feel that spiritual gifts manifest suddenly with<br>
no effort (other than developing one's relationship with God).  While<br>
that may happen, I'm sure myself that some require more or less real<br>
effort on our part, but are gifts nonetheless.<br>

<i>&gt; Warren Trenchard of Canadian Union College has written to me,</i><br>
<i>&gt; asking for E-mail addresses of religion teachers at SDA colleges</i><br>
<i>&gt; and graduate students in religion.  I told him there were basically</i><br>
<i>&gt; no people of that sort signed up to SDAnet.  But if anyone knows of some,</i><br>
<i>&gt; send their addresses to me (if you think they wouldn't mind) and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; will forward them to him.  This is evidently in connection with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; scholarly association of Adventists whose acronyms I forget.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Andrews University is in the process of putting in a fiber optic campus<br>
backbone.  Most of the fiber has been installed, but most of the<br>
buildings haven't been connected up yet.  The Seminary and Griggs Hall,<br>
where the religion department is housed, are amoung the first buildings<br>
to be added.  Some of the religion teachers are eager to get connected<br>
to the network.  A couple already have accounts and use them regularly.<br>
Others will soon follow.<br>
<p>
Nancy Vyhmeister is on SDAnet and is in the SDA Theological Seminary, if<br>
that counts as a religion department. :-&gt;<br>
<p>
Which scholarly association of Adventists might that be?  The<br>
Adventist Theological Society? (ATS)<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
Tony's reply <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This concept of being sinful without sinning...it has interesting implications</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the "translation faith" discussion as well.</i><br>
<p>
regarding the question post to SDAnet : <br>
<p>
?----&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;Question:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Does anybody know if Adam and/or Eve ever sinned on a "lesser" scale before &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;they ate from the forbidden fruit.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;&lt;----</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
it very true. However I must disagree with Tony's opinion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let's see, sin is an inner state of being which is outwardly manifested as</i><br>
<i>&gt;actions known as sins. Eve and Adam eating the forbidden fruit was an</i><br>
<i>&gt;action which demonstrated their choice to distrust God's words to them</i><br>
<i>&gt;and hence to disobey him.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
If the above statement is true then God created imperfect, or sinful <br>
people with a sinful inner state. And God just arbitrarily selects an<br>
external act on which to condemn Adam.<br>
<p>
<p>
There is no such thing as a lesser sin, all sin is sin and receives the<br>
same reward, death.<br>
<p>
According to the scriptures Sin is not a state of being. And like the Jews<br>
in Jesus time, the opinion of the Rabbis does not really count for much.<br>
<p>
<p>
1 John 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the<br>
           transgression of the law. (KJV)<br>
<p>
James 4:17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him<br>
           it is sin. (KJV)<br>
<p>
<p>
Sin  by the definition of the scriptures alone (sola scritura) is an act.<br>
An act of choice. This act can either be phyical or mental yet it is still <br>
an act.<br>
<p>
There is no other definition in the bible apart from sin as choice.<br>
<p>
If we really want to understand what sin is, then lets get a really good<br>
theological handle on it by turning to James 1:15  which says.<br>
<p>
"Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is<br>
accomplished, it brings forth death." <br>
<p>
 <br>
ONLY after the LUST conceives it is SIN not before and such we are not <br>
guilty until that time. LUST in itself is not sin unless it is cherished<br>
(which is what is meant by conceiving).<br>
<p>
To directly answer the first question. I would say no they did not sin<br>
before eating of the forbidden fruit. If they had then separation from<br>
God would have occured at that point because <br>
<p>
"...your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins<br>
have hid His face from you, that He will not hear." Isa 59:2<br>
<p>
Yet we read in Genesis that it is only after eating of the fruit that they<br>
were separated from God. <br>
<p>
Sin is the act of rebelling against God and His commandments, the bible<br>
talks about sin as being a mystery, the mystery of iniquity. It is impossible<br>
for us to know exactly when the point of conception occurs yet after it has <br>
happened we know it has. The same with the conception of sin, it is in <br>
likemanner a mystery.<br>
<p>
<p>
Ruben.<br>

The current US Presidential election has made "Family Values" a byword in <br>
the American political scene.  However, with this thread I don't wish to <br>
focus directly on the term as defined by George Bush.  Rather, I want to <br>
explore how our church can strengthen the family.  <br>
<p>
The church I currently attend has a books membership somewhat over 200.<br>
In a brief mental survey of the families that attend the church, I can only <br>
count eight families in which both parents are members of the church and <br>
some children are still living at home and coming to church.  (This means<br>
we are most probably above average.)  A church in Illinois with which I<br>
was acquainted had a staff where all three of its ministers were currently<br>
or had been divorced.<br>
<p>
The central issue is this:  We claim that we should relate to God as a <br>
father or as a close friend.  The problem is that we do exactly that, and <br>
our dysfunctional relationships with God mirror our experience of<br>
dysfunctional relationships with families and friends.<br>
<p>
How can we increase the importance of the family in the SDA church without<br>
condemning or alienating the people who are fast becoming the majority<br>
in our church, namely singles be they those who never married, are divorced,<br>
or are single parents for whatever reason?<br>

Ironically, Jesus focused his attention on those people whose families<br>
were not perfect or perfectly pure: the woman at the well (5 husbands),<br>
the widow, the woman caught in adultry, those demon possessed, etc. He<br>
seemed to focus on the outcasts, those who in society who were not<br>
considered the "perfect family." He came to set the captives free. We<br>
do not read about him giving family enrichment seminars to synagogue<br>
families. For too long our church has alienated those members and non-<br>
members who were not traditional family units. But our church family<br>
should become the family for those who are singles, divorced, single<br>
parents, etc. We should be the place where they feel at home, not where<br>
they feel criticized and disenfranchised. We have always encouraged<br>
the traditional family unit through our education system and its focus<br>
in religion classes on THE ADVENTIST HOME and marriage issues in the<br>
Youth Guidance class at the academy level. If you are an acute observor<br>
of graphic and visuals in our church's publications, you will see the<br>
role model of the foursome family in all our publications, textbooks,<br>
etc.: Mom, Dad, big brother, little sister. <br>
<p>
Our church, however, fails many times in providing social occasions<br>
for church group activities. Remember the olden days of the Saturday]<br>
night church social when everyone came (all ages) and had a great<br>
time? <br>

There is an excellent book on making these events happen in the church<br>
family which are fun, inclusive, and connect different ages and social<br>
groups. It's by Marlene LaFever. I'll send the title when I think of it.<br>
<p>
Perhaps this is why many other denominations build gymnasiums, bowling<br>
alleys, and plan a myriad of activities and help groups centered at <br>
their churches. <br>

<i>&gt; How can we increase the importance of the family in the SDA church without</i><br>
<i>&gt; condemning or alienating the people who are fast becoming the majority</i><br>
<i>&gt; in our church, namely singles be they those who never married, are divorced,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or are single parents for whatever reason?</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure if increasing the importance of the family is the <br>
proper focus.  Personally, I think there should be more emphasis <br>
on personal responsibility for one's actions, and the seriousness <br>
of marriage.  We have divorces because one or both members of a <br>
couple do not take their marriage vows seriously.  consequently, <br>
one or both have affairs, and the marriage breaks up.  Or they<br>
get into arguments and instead of working to resolve their <br>
differences, become hateful or just plain decide to trash the <br>
marriage because it's too much work.<br>
<p>
Each prospective marriage partner must ask themself these questions:<br>
Am I prepared to commit the rest of my life to this person, no <br>
matter what the future may bring?  Am I prepared to be faithful to <br>
this person, forsaking all others, for the rest of my life?  Am I <br>
prepared to make whatever effort is required to make this marriage<br>
be a successful one?   If -both- people can't answer all three <br>
questions in the affirmative, they should not get married.  If all<br>
marriages were made up of people that -did- answer "yes", and <br>
subsequently lived up to their vows, no one would be talking about <br>
'family values', because our families would be rock solid.<br>
<p>
When we marry, we make a personal commitment to our spouses and to <br>
God.  If we each lived up to those personal commitments, broken <br>
families would disappear.<br>

----&gt;<br>
If the above statement is true then God created imperfect, or sinful <br>
people with a sinful inner state. And God just arbitrarily selects an<br>
external act on which to condemn Adam.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
No, God created beings with the ability and the responsibility to choose<br>
their inner state. If they chose to rebel, that was not something imposed<br>
upon them by their creator.<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
There is no such thing as a lesser sin, all sin is sin and receives the<br>
same reward, death.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
Agreed.<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
According to the scriptures Sin is not a state of being. And like the Jews<br>
in Jesus time, the opinion of the Rabbis does not really count for much.<br>
<p>
<p>
1 John 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the<br>
           transgression of the law. (KJV)<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
The RSV says "Everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is <br>
lawlessness"<br>
<p>
As for the rabbis, I agree that their opinions and interpretations need<br>
careful examination. That's one reason why I haven't actually *said* much<br>
in my posts on translation faith. I refer all interested to various written<br>
work because these men, just like Ruben, quote extensively from scripture<br>
and give an interpretation. We certainly need to discern which interpretations<br>
are consistent with the message of the Bible.<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
James 4:17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him<br>
           it is sin. (KJV)<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
The RSV says "Whoever knows what is right to do and fails to do it, for him<br>
it is sin." This is interesting, because it seems to indicate that a person<br>
who did not know what was right may not be held accountable for doing the<br>
wrong thing. What is sin for me may not be sin for someone else. This is<br>
consistent with the view that sin is a state of lawlessness or rebellion<br>
against God, because if sin was defined as a set of actions then surely<br>
the same set of actions would be applied to everybody.<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
If we really want to understand what sin is, then lets get a really good<br>
theological handle on it by turning to James 1:15  which says.<br>
<p>
"Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is<br>
accomplished, it brings forth death." <br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
Quoting from the RSV again, "...each person is tempted when he is lured<br>
and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives<br>
birth to sin; and sin when it is full-grown brings forth death."<br>
<p>
Once again this is consistent with the definition of sin as a state<br>
of rebellion. In this case, the birth of sin occurs inside the person,<br>
and the full-grown sin is manifested in rebellious, unloving actions.<br>
<p>
Although I despise the proof-text technique, I will finish with a couple<br>
of statements made by Jesus.<br>
<p>
"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But<br>
 I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already<br>
 committed adultery with her in his heart.'..."  Matthew 4:27, part of the<br>
sermon on the mount.<br>
<p>
Speaking to his disciples about the pharisees preoccupation with ceremonial<br>
rites, "But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this<br>
defiles a man. For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery,<br>
fornication, theft, false witness, slander. These are what defile a man;<br>
but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man." Matthew 15:18-20<br>
<p>
One thing I have learned as a scientist is that the interpretation you make<br>
of a given set of data is often a result of what you read into it. A simple<br>
example can be found in the origins debate. Some scientist marvels over the<br>
finely balanced ecosystem he is investigating, and points out the footprints<br>
of natural selection and evolution at every turn. A Christian looks at <br>
exactly the same thing and sees wonderful evidence for a designer, Creator<br>
God.<br>
<p>
If I read the Bible as a person who believes in the fallen, sinful nature<br>
of Christ, and that sin is defined as actions, then I will see lots of texts<br>
which support my point of view. If I read it as a person who believes that<br>
sin is a state of being, that Christ was born sinless and through the power<br>
of God stayed sinless, then I will still see lots of texts which support my<br>
view. Many of them will be the same texts. <br>
<p>
This is why it is so important to give both perspectives a fair hearing. I<br>
myself am in the process of that right now. My motivation for writing this<br>
post has largely been to point out that you can't just quote a whole lot<br>
of texts, interpret them the way you want, and say that the debate is over.<br>
<p>
Let's face it, the SDA church has done an about turn on this issue more <br>
than once. Obviously it is a difficult topic, and both views can be and<br>
often are taken to an extreme.<br>

You may have noticed that shipments of messages from SDAnet have recently <br>
been arriving in only two batches a day.  I am now sending out only <br>
one batch in the morning and one batch in the evening.  It's entertaining<br>
that sometimes I get replies on them back from Australia before they <br>
have gotten across campus to my other account.<br>
<p>
We now have 95 working addresses signed up to SDAnet.  We have gotten <br>
a lot of new members recently, but also have been losing regulars due <br>
to lack of net access.  I'd like to see us break the 100-member hump.<br>
Also, somewhere during the flurry of activity last month, SDAnet sent<br>
out its 2000th message.  In today's issue of the Columbia Union Visitor<br>
there is supposed to be an article detailing SDAnet and how to sign up.<br>
Someone please let me know when you see it, because I don't currently <br>
get the Visitor.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
<p>
"Amazing love, how can it that thou my God should die for me."<br>
<p>
"And Jesus came unto them saying, "all power is given unto me in heaven<br>
and in earth" MAtt 28:18<br>
<p>
<p>
The question is then : Is God unable or unwilling to give His children<br>
the victory over all sin in their lives, and fit them for translation ?<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Very true, but the writings of men never compare with a clear <br>
"Thus saith the Lord."<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; ----&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; James 4:17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
yep, agreed, Sin is the ACT of choosing to rebel against (disobey) God,<br>
( however there are two separate things, evil and sin, all sin is evil<br>
not all evil is sin, e.g. a cat killing a bird ) <br>
<p>
get a hold of this :<br>
<p>
What then happens if I do not know, can I claim ignorance ? <br>
Is my sin proportionate to my knowledge ?<br>
<p>
   "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but<br>
    now they have no cloke for their sin." John 15:22 <br>
   "If I had not done among them the works which none other man did,<br>
    they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me<br>
    and my Father." John 15:24  <br>
   "Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but<br>
    now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth." John 9:41<br>
   "Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the<br>
    mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and<br>
    Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.<br>
    But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon<br>
    at the day of judgment, than for you.<br>
    And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be<br>
    brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done<br>
    in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this<br>
    day. But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of<br>
    Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.<br>
    At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord<br>
    of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the<br>
    wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. "Matt 11:21-25 <br>
      [willful ignorance however is not excused]<br>

<i>&gt; This is why it is so important to give both perspectives a fair hearing. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; myself am in the process of that right now. My motivation for writing this</i><br>
<i>&gt; post has largely been to point out that you can't just quote a whole lot</i><br>
<i>&gt; of texts, interpret them the way you want, and say that the debate is over.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
hey, who said the discussion was over. For some it may just be beginning.<br>
It is through discussion that we learn, I'm all for it. <br>
<p>
One thing though is that all discussion should be solidly based on the<br>
scriptures, and if that means profound biblical analysis then let it be. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Let's face it, the SDA church has done an about turn on this issue more </i><br>
<i>&gt; than once. Obviously it is a difficult topic, and both views can be and</i><br>
<i>&gt; often are taken to an extreme.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I won't necessarily agree with you here, some sections of the church may have<br>
done an about turn on this issue, but the generalisation would not be true.<br>
<p>

<p>
	I'm not so sure it's so cut and dry.  I know of a family that<br>
has gone through very difficult times.  They were true to their vows, and<br>
are still together.  However, it is NOT a rock solid family.  It is not<br>
always happy or stable, but it is always there.  (Perhaps I'm not sure<br>
what you say "rock solid" means.)<br>
	In other cultures, for example, Islamic and Indian, it is a VERY<br>
disgraceful thing to get a divorce.  Social pressures enforce their vows.<br>
They are committed, and work out solutions to their differences, although<br>
it is often not ideal.<br>
	My point is that committment is not the key.  Some people do<br>
want to have successful marriages, but sincerely don't know how to.<br>
I think that is where the "family values" come into play.  People need<br>
to know how to deal with anger, differences, growing old, mid-life<br>
crisis, medical problems, money, work, etc.  I think the church has a<br>
role here in teaching some of these things.<br>

FYI<br>
<p>
The Andrews Society of Religious Scholars is the association of college<br>
Bible teachers at SDA colleges.  ASRS took that name so that it could<br>
be a legit group at the Society of Biblical Literature which most of<br>
the teachers were already attending.  The group meets once a year and<br>
has been functioning for some 20 years.  In spite of the opinion of some<br>
that this is a "liberal" group, and unworthy of mention, I think the group<br>
has a proper function.  There are common topics that professors of religion<br>
in SDA institutions might discuss.  Warren Trenchard, head of the religion<br>
dept. at Canadian Union College is the incoming president.  Gerald Winslow<br>
of Pacific Union College is the outgoing president.  The society's meeting<br>
will take place in San Francisco in November, just before the big meeting<br>
of the Society of Biblical Literature.<br>
<p>
 No, this society is not the same as the ATS, which only represents a small<br>
 part of the group of SDA profs. of religion.<br>
<p>
 I belong to neither organization, but am well acquainted with both.<br>

I have to agree with Dan when he states that just because a family is<br>
together doesn't mean that it is a rock solid family.  The Dysfunctional<br>
Family is very common in the US and in most church denominations.  Many<br>
children live with both parents together but the home is not loving, not<br>
nurturing, and not happy.  Many times this is because of personaility<br>
problems of the parents.  I'm not taking about not able to get along.  I'm<br>
talking about defects in the personality, lifetime problems that have<br>
left pathology, and childhood tragedies that have scarred their ability<br>
to be happy, to love, and to be unselfish as a marriage partner or parent.<br>
Unfortunately, these difficulties also affect their perceptions of God,<br>
the church, and the world.<br>
<p>
The key to building rock solid families is to heal the individual.  Rather<br>
than focusing on purging lives of sin, keeping couples commited to each<br>
other, and making the home happy, the church needs to focus on individual<br>
needs.  The need to be able to give and receive love.  The need for healing<br>
and being able to forgive.  The need for somebody to care.  Too many times<br>
the church becomes involved only at the eleventh hour when the marriage<br>
is at the edge of divorce.  Many couples are hurting but carry a facade<br>
that all is well.  Paul instructed us to confess our weaknesses to one<br>
another (not our sins).  Once people in the church realize that even<br>
the "pillars" in the community have problems, we can become more open<br>
about our pain and where we need help.  Then the church will realize<br>
what is really needed to help our families.<br>
<p>
We don't need more marriage encounter programs.  We don't need more<br>
brow beating about lack of commitment or spirituality.  We need a church<br>
that cares about the individual whether they be single, married, divorced,<br>
old, young, middle age.  The healing that Christ brought in His ministry<br>
to the individual is what the world needs.  He focused on the person and<br>
that person's problems.  A marriage can never be rock solid when the<br>
individuals in that marriage are not solid themselves.<br>

Ruben,<br>
<p>
I've never seen a single person on SDAnet concede an inch in any doctrinal<br>
issue being discussed.  What it always turns out to be is a debate over<br>
views and attempted proofs.  When the dust settles, has anyone learned<br>
anything for the betterment of their souls?  You stated that through<br>
discussion, we learn.  I sincerely hope that it not true about spiritual<br>
matters.  It is only through personal study and instruction from the HOly<br>
Spirit that we learn truth, not discussion.<br>
<p>
I wish SDAnet could retire discussion on perfection for awhile.  It was<br>
hashed out several months ago and once again is monopolizing the bandwidth.<br>
There are many other important issues that could and should be discussed.<br>
Let's move on and give perfection a rest.<br>

Cheryl mentioned that she thought that individuals needed to be healed first<br>
before relationships could be healed.  I'd like to put a twist on that,<br>
if I may.<br>
<p>
I propose that healing relationships is the way that individuals are healed,<br>
because family relationships form a significant part of one's identity.<br>
The image of God is reflected in relationships, and if relationships are<br>
misguided the individual will have a distorted view of God and of<br>
himself.<br>
<p>
There are various books written with techniques of how to restore people<br>
who have fallen into offense (a technical term in the Greek signifying<br>
a broken relationship).  It would be interesting to share some of them <br>
and I will try to do that.<br>

Hi, Steve,<br>
<p>
Do I smell a chicken-or-egg type of cause-effect problem arising?<br>
<p>
Do we have to start healing the individual before healing families,<br>
as Cheryl suggests, or healing the family before healing individuals?<br>
<p>
The pragmatic thing to do is try to "solve" both problems at the <br>
same time. But it sounds too easy. <br>
<p>
OK, Bible scholars and psych majors, go at it! :)<br>

I have two articles on I John.  One of them (the older) I haven't really<br>
read in detail.  As such I don't know how these two views fit together. <br>
The first article is Sakae Kubo's "I John 3:9: Absolute or Habitual?"<br>
found in Andrews University Seminary Studies Vol. VII, no. 1 January 1969.<br>
The second article is Steven Vitrano's "The Doctrine of Sin in I John"<br>
found in Andrews University Seminary Studies Vol. 25, no. 1 Spring 1987. <br>
In the latter article Mr. Vitrano puts forth evidence that John speaks of<br>
to different groups:  the children of God and the children of the devil. <br>
He moves on to argue that the verse saying "Every one who commits sin is<br>
guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness." taken in the context of v. 6<br>
(no one who abides in him sins) and v. 9 (no one born of God commits sin)<br>
refers to kind of sin (sin under a particular attitude towards it) that is<br>
commited by the children of the devil.  Also, he notes a parallel<br>
construction with v. 3 "And every one who thus<br>
hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure."  Again he points to the<br>
distinct groups being spoken of by John.  With the point about I John 3:4<br>
about lawlessness, he expands on evidence of agreement with Paul (Rom.<br>
6:3, 5-7, 12-14, 19; also Rom. 8:1-8).<br>
<p>
Next the author goes on to discuss the sin of God's children.  He goes to<br>
I John 1:9: "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, and will<br>
forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."  The same Greek<br>
word for unrighteousness is used in 5:17 where John says "All wrongdoing<br>
[unrighteousness] is sin."  Again another kind of sin appears (here there<br>
is a different attitude towards it).  <br>
<p>
Next he discusses I John 5:16: "If any one sees his brother committing<br>
what is not a mortal sin, he will ask, and God will give him life for<br>
those whose sin is not mortal.  There is sin which is mortal; I do not say<br>
that one is to pray for that."  He argues that the distinction here is<br>
that the one individual has an advocate in Jesus as such their sin is not<br>
mortal.  Here he points to verses in Hebrews (2:17-18; 7:25; 9:24).  Then<br>
he considers objections.  He ends the article with a chart of the two<br>
groups in English and Greek and then quotes I John 5:18-21.<br>
<p>
On the surface I thought it was pretty good; however, maybe I missed<br>
something.<br>

It may be true that the main participants in this discussion do not<br>
change their views very much.  But I think there are many people<br>
sitting on the sidelines who may not have thought about these issues<br>
much before.  For them especially I think this discussion can be useful,<br>
especially since the presentations I have seen in denominational<br>
publications do not make the issues clear, perhaps in order to avoid<br>
controversy.<br>

Thanks, Dave P. for your comments on the discussion.  My feelings on the <br>
discussion:  It is better to discuss than to hurl brickbats from a distance.<br>
I think most people in the SDA church don't know the difference between<br>
the various views that have been expressed.  There are at least three sides<br>
here, possibly more.  Probably, many don't care and Cheryl has rightly <br>
raised the question of whether they should.  I don't think anyone <br>
actually understood the implications of the question I posed at the beginning<br>
of the translation faith thread, or if they did, they didn't post.<br>
<p>
The protagonists on the two extremes of the issue are almost unable to<br>
communicate with each other anymore.  In some circles any suggestion<br>
that "The Law of the Lord is perfect." (Psalm 19:7) is viewed as hopeless<br>
perfectionism.   The two sides use different definitions of "nature"<br>
if they use definitions at all.  One of the main goals of SDAnet<br>
is to keep lines of communication open, and this is an important issue<br>
to do this on.  Having said that, you notice that I have stopped sending<br>
out any of my posts on the issue.  Among the other things more important<br>
are the role of the Holy Spirit in the church.  More in my next post.<br>
<p>

I offered a qualified **YES** to your question, Steve.  I think the underlying<br>
issue is whether learning Spanish fits into the scheme of things in the<br>
overall plan for your life.  For example, is this a "come over to Macedonia<br>
and help yes" situation?  Is it a situation where you have a specific skill<br>
or leadership that this company of worshipper needs?  Do you feel you have<br>
a specific "calling" to worship and minister to the hispanics?  Or is it<br>
a case of "I'm tired of the lukewarm bath I received when I worship with the<br>
English-speaking congregations?"   It is more fulfilling to us to worship<br>
and serve with enthusiastic new converts.  But does the Lord always want us<br>
to serve where it is "easier", "more comfortable", or "more personally<br>
fulfilling"?  I suggest that there are times for both.  Paul found himself<br>
frustrated with some congregations and totally blessed with others.  But did<br>
that mean that he was to preach where he personally was more blessed abd<br>
(and) neglect those where he felt unfulfilled?<br>
<p>
I guess what I'm saying is the underlying reason a person wants something<br>
from the Lord will indicate whether one should pray for a special gift to<br>
fulfill that purpose.  If one does not receive the gift it could mean one<br>
of two things:  either it was not the Lord's will for that person (would<br>
not benefit the person asking or could be a hindrance to the person) or<br>
the person was not spiritually prepared to receive the outpouring of the<br>
Holy Spirit.<br>
<p>
That's me two cents.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;I had never really investigated the issue of Christian perfection at</i><br>
<i>&gt;all before. I suppose the issues which are closest to me are ones to</i><br>
<i>&gt;do with the relationship of religion and science, and things to do with</i><br>
<i>&gt;music. The views represented by Ruben have only ever been given to me</i><br>
<i>&gt;by people who don't believe things are that way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Tony</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I just feel that I should add my idea of perfection.<br>
My view of PERFECTION is that of continued CHRISTIAN MATURITY.  Whatever<br>
good is there to be done that I am aware of, I should do it.  Jesus' <br>
prayer for His disciples was that "they would be perfected even as Thou<br>
(God the Father) art perfect.  Maybe I've taken a wimpish approach to it,<br>
but for it to make sence to me, I have to interprete it as continual growth.<br>
<p>
Somebody point out my error!<br>

Just another tho't here:  Even if Steve was not involved in direct<br>
ministry or leadership, simply being able to converse with them in their<br>
native language will help them feel more at home in that congregation.<br>
<p>
Permit me to share an anecdote:  The group of deaf SDA's in the Portland, OR,<br>
and Vancouver, WA, area met for quite a few years in the B church and then<br>
for quite a few years in the ST church (names shortened to protect the<br>
guilty 8-).  During those years, not one hearing member took the time to<br>
learn even a rudimentary level of sign language (or so I was told by the<br>
deaf group).  And if, perchance, the two groups were to have services<br>
together, the deaf group had to sit "in the back of the bus".  How welcome<br>
do you suppose they felt in those churches?  Then, when hearing members<br>
of the GP church learned sign language and involved the deaf in their<br>
campouts, potlucks, etc., and invited them to sit at the *front* of the<br>
church, and just generally made them feel at home ... what a difference!<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
	I know I run the risk of disappointing Cheryl by making this<br>
further comment (I'm sorry).<br>
<p>
<p>
Bill writes :<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My view of PERFECTION is that of continued CHRISTIAN MATURITY.  Whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt;good is there to be done that I am aware of, I should do it.  Jesus' </i><br>
<i>&gt;prayer for His disciples was that "they would be perfected even as Thou</i><br>
<i>&gt;(God the Father) art perfect.  Maybe I've taken a wimpish approach to it,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but for it to make sence to me, I have to interprete it as continual growth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Somebody point out my error!</i><br>
<p>
What error ?<br>
<p>
Well Bill, you got it in a nut shell, perfection means continual growth.<br>
This is easy to see since Jesus as a man (whom we all know was perfect)<br>
we are told "grew in grace" and that "through that which he suffered was <br>
made perfect" so we see that perfection is not a plateau that one reaches<br>
but a path that one progresses on.<br>

We have discussed school choice here before.  (For those outside the USA,<br>
it's somewhat of an issue in our current presidential campaign.  Pres. Bush<br>
proposes issuing a voucher of $1000 to most school-age children, to be <br>
spent on education in the school of their choice, be it public, private,<br>
or religious.)  The Liberty magazine editorial staff generally opposes such<br>
plans as violation of the separation of church and state.  I can remember<br>
organized church opposition to such a plan when it was proposed in the state<br>
of Michigan.  Roy Adams, assoc. editor of the Review, caused no little <br>
firestorm by suggesting that such choice might be appropriate.<br>
<p>
I revisit this issue because a troublesome  thought occurred to me.<br>
How is the above-described school choice for grade school students any <br>
different than the federal grants which most college students get to use<br>
at the college of their choice?  Can we consistently benefit from one<br>
and oppose the other?<br>
<p>
It might be interesting to hear from other countries where government funding<br>
of SDA schools on lower levels is already happening.  A desire to maintain<br>
government funding kept our schools in South Africa segregated longer than <br>
they otherwise would have been, for instance.  How is it in Australia?<br>

I've stopped trying to be perfect.  Instead, I'm working on<br>
being nice, compassionate, patient, reliable.  I can't speak<br>
for anyone else, but I like me a lot more this way.  Trying<br>
to be perfect made me feel crabby, impatient, guilty, etc.<br>
<p>
To those tortured souls still trying to purge themselves of<br>
bad thoughts, bad feelings, bad habits,  I offer the following<br>
<p>
1.	Jesus died for us while we were yet sinners.<br>
2.	The controversy is between Christ and Satan, not<br>
	between me and my weaknesses.<br>
3.	The agenda for your reformation is not yours to set.<br>
	That is the responsibility of the Holy Spirit.<br>
4.	We are all going to heaven hanging on to Christ's<br>
	coat tails.  Grab on and be glad!<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Here in Australia our schools do accept government funding. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; funding does not pay wages, but does help a lot with running costs.</i><br>
<p>
Our local public-school district offered a program last year to<br>
"aid" home-school families.<br>
<p>
Roughly 90% of the qualifying families turned down the offer because<br>
of various strings attached, such as required textbooks and course<br>
offerings.  The money would have been useful, but the baggage that<br>
weighed it down sort of ruined things.<br>
<p>
We pay our taxes to pay for the schools we don't use, and pay some<br>
more to support our local church's elementary school that we don't<br>
currently use, and we pay more for materials and so on to home<br>
school our own.<br>
<p>
Somewhere, *somebody* had better benefit from all this.  :}<br>
<p>
Vouchers sound interesting until you see the strings that invariably<br>
seem to trail in their wake.<br>
<p>
Nobody said it was going to be easy...<br>

Steve Hix mentioned that often if not always voucher money comes with <br>
strings attached.  This is also true of Federal student aid for colleges.<br>
By having federal grants awarded to students studying at a college, that<br>
college is required to meet a long set of nondiscrimination laws.<br>
So far, though, hardly anyone has complained.  The exception is Colin<br>
Standish, former president of Columbia Union College, in his book<br>
Defenders Of the Faith, who claims that making our colleges essentially<br>
tuition-driven and making most students depend on federal aid was quite<br>
a mistake.<br>
<p>
So I repeat my question.  Why is it that college "vouchers" are generally <br>
considered acceptable and elementary and high school vouchers are not?<br>

A totally different question:  When is giving to good causes excessive?<br>
When one gives to the detriment of one's safety net--provision for emer-<br>
gencies--is one expressing faith in God's care?  Mary and the poor widow<br>
gave richly.  Jesus commended them.  When an elderly SDA lady gives away<br>
funds from her trust, trusting in the ravens, is she a paradigm of trust?<br>
How much materialism is appropriate for a Christian?<br>

It's amazing what people will do when it's a necessity rather than an option.<br>
Our tertiary institutions would probably not survive financially if it was<br>
not for government assistance, even if that only comes in the form of allowancesfor students.<br>
<p>
To me, there is no problem accepting government assistance for anything so long<br>
as the strings attached do not force you to do something you don't want to do.<br>
Once this starts to happen, then you can stop accepting the money, and in the<br>
meantime you've benefited.<br>
<p>
The most interesting case at the moment is in New Zealand, where the entire<br>
church administration is in financial trouble. Our two biggest secondary<br>
schools over there are seriously threatened with closure, and to survive<br>
they are having to amalgamate with the state school system. This quote comes<br>
from "Record", our South Pacific Division magazine.<br>
<p>
     Integration of New Zealand Adventist schools with the government<br>
     school system appears a reality. By 1993 Auckland Adventist High<br>
     School and Hawkes Bay Adventist Primary School will be integrated.<br>
     A "Statement of Special Character" is being prepared ensuring the<br>
     schools will not lose their Adventist orientation while receiving<br>
     government financial assistance.<br>
           "Record", October 3, 1992, p4<br>
<p>
This scenario is even more frightening than simply accepting government<br>
money. Those who constructed this scheme must have worked out things like<br>
who will hire and fire, who will be on the school board and so on. All the<br>
same, it is obviously a desperate measure. But as long as the schools retain<br>
their mission and their "Adventist orientation" I suppose it does provide<br>
people with an Adventist education they wouldn't otherwise get.<br>

I'm wondering who among the SDAnet users I might meet in the<br>
course of my routine travels to professional conferences.  I'm<br>
a mathematics educator, so I regularly attend NCTM meetings.<br>
I'll be at the 10th International Conference on Teaching and<br>
Technology at MIT in March, the NCTM Annual in Seattle in<br>
April, at NSF for a SuperQuest meeting Nov 12.  Were any of<br>
you at ICME-7 in Quebec City in August?  If you are a mathematics<br>
teacher or are interested in mathematics education, I'd like<br>
to get your email addresses.  <br>
<p>
Best wishes,<br>

In recent years, a new excuse against Christian education has grown in<br>
popularity.  It rises out of a so-called philosophy of parenting which says:<br>
"I'll tell my kids about Jesus and let them go to Sabbath School if they<br>
want, then they can make their own decisions."<br>
<p>
The problem with this philosophy is that it presumes that a neutral<br>
presentation of both sides is enough to make someone love the truth.<br>
In fact, while sometimes this may be enough, other times we can have<br>
problems with this approach.  <br>
<p>
Whatever happened to the model of immersion in the truth, beginning at<br>
home with the parents before school ever starts, and continuing through<br>
family worship all the way through schooling?  Added to this the<br>
reinforcement of Bible classes and a God-centered education in a church<br>
school as well as Sabbath School.  This (if it is executed right, which<br>
it isn't always)<br>
can be the difference between making someone know the truth and love the truth.<br>
<p>
Note that I am not advocating using subterfuge or flawed logic to defend<br>
doctrine, nor am I advocating denying the child any decision-making<br>
power.<br>
But I have seen again and again how superior the approach "come on,<br>
let's go to church" is to "do you want to go to church?"<br>
<p>
How many times do we presume that young people don't want to come to<br>
programs when in fact they are eager to see something happen, and all<br>
that's needed is a little bit of impetus?  How many times do we see<br>
young people drift away<br>
from the church who are not hostile, but neither are they challenged?<br>
I realize all this is easy for me as a non-parent to say.  Does any<br>
parent have a counter-view on this?<br>

   Quite some time ago, I read the following statement in some<br>
personal e-mail.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Jesus (in his role as Michael, the archangel)...</i><br>
<p>
Would anyone care to comment on the identity of Michael?<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>

<i>&gt; "I'll tell my kids about Jesus and let them go to Sabbath School if they</i><br>

<p>
This attitude seems predicated upon the notion that kids will basically<br>
turn out OK on their own (similar to secular humanist tho't; similar also<br>
to Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire in such works as "Emile" and "Candide",<br>
if I recall my French Lit survey class).  However, Scripture tells us that<br>
there is a great controversy going on, with Satan out to destroy your<br>
children, whether physically or spiritually (1Pet 5:8, Is 49:25, et al).<br>
Hence, left to themselves, except some other person prays a hedge of<br>
thorns about them (so to speak; see Hosea), their choices will tend greatly<br>
towards spiritual declension if not disengagement.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; truth and [them] lov[ing] the truth.</i><br>
<p>
Deut ch 5,6,7 contain a number of relevant texts.  As to why parents<br>
aren't doing the above?  I would suggest their own lack of a deepening<br>
spirituality which, as a consequence, has left them open to being<br>
deceived (2 Thess 2:11 and its context; Gal 6:7).  I have observed<br>
how my own failings can affect the spiritual tone of the whole family.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [...] not hostile, but neither are they challenged?</i><br>
<p>
Philip Samaan, a few years ago, faced a rowdy youth group at a campmeeting.<br>
How the group turned around was the topic of a presentation that he made<br>
at Redwood Campmeeting a few years ago.  I was not there, but was told about<br>
it:  Relational Bible study (I think Samaan has a book out on this).<br>
<p>
I would also make a plug for Bill Gothard's Basic Youth Conflicts seminars<br>
as they directly address these issues.<br>

In Fred's reply he suggested the material of Bill Gothard's Institute<br>
In Basic Youth Conflicts. I am surprised for several reasons.<br>
<p>
1)  I thought that this group was essentially out of business now, the <br>
damage having been caused when Bill's own son rebelled against him.  Are <br>
they still actually giving seminars?<br>
<p>
2)  The view of "chain of command" as he presents it is in my opinion<br>
not Biblically based, but rather designed to enforce in the minds of parents<br>
with problems that they must be right after all.  In other words, he <br>
makes his money by telling troubled parents what they want to hear.<br>
<p>
3)  He damaged his credibility seriously by making a number of false<br>
accusations against Christian recording artists.<br>
<p>
Gothard is part of the Christian parapsychology which arose in the 70's<br>
and early 80's, baptizing worldly concepts and clinging to them when the <br>
world of psychology had long since abandoned them because research had<br>
shown them to be false.  <br>

First let's look at what archangel means.  It appears twice in the New<br>
Testament.  Once in relation to the voice heard at the second coming and<br>
the other time in relation to Michael fighting Satan over Moses body.<br>
It is composed from the verb ARKHO and the noun AGGELOS.  Literally it<br>
means chief messenger or first of the messengers where the ARKH- has the<br>
implication of rulership.  Michael comes from the Hebrew and I gather asks<br>
the question "Who [is] like God?"  Typically Adventists have considered<br>
Micheal to a be a reference to Jesus.  Just judging from the usage and<br>
meaning of archangel and from Micheal being called prince (in a similar<br>
meaning to that of ARKH-) and the only angel to be called such (as far as<br>
I know), I would agree with this opinion.  Again, if it hasn't been made<br>
clear from the above the Bible portrays one archangel and calls him Michael.<br>
Also, I should note that in Revelation we see Michael and his angels<br>
versus Satan and his angels.  I see this as significant.  Anyway...<br>

I have just been on the losing end of a battle which is causing me to <br>
rethink ideas of separation of church and state, and the wider issues<br>
of if separation is really the best way to go.<br>
<p>
The non-denominational Gospel Choir at Carnegie Mellon, of which I once <br>
was a member, was called before the Student Senate for review of their <br>
funding status.  It seems that in its bylaws the Student Senate prohibits<br>
funding of religious organizations.  <br>
<p>
At first the complaints centered around some supposed complaints by an<br>
anonymous former member of the group that "everyone was trying to<br>
convert her" but through the course of the debate it became clear that<br>
some people who were leading the charge were upset that religious songs<br>
were being sung on campus at all.  <br>
<p>
In the end, it was decided to broaden the definition of religious group to <br>
include the gospel choir, and to deny them funding.  <br>
<p>
I could give more details, but my point is that this experience has shown me <br>
that the PC-left is not my friend.  These types are all over university<br>
campuses.  They preach diversity and freedom of speech and religion, but<br>
when the rubber meets the road they have no respect for either.  The strong<br>
influence of the feminist movement and the pro-choice movement have lead<br>
to the strong undercurrent that religion is not Politically Correct.  <br>
And when religious expression is curtailed, anti-religious expression<br>
is by default promoted.  There is no reason to assume that any of the <br>
three presidential candidates will be a defender of religious liberty.<br>
<p>
In the 1960's, Adventists were fond of saying that JFK was going to bring<br>
in the pope and cause the time of trouble.  (Although JFK's record on <br>
church-state issues was probably better than any president who has<br>
followed him.)  In 1976, there was alarm that Carter and his flock of<br>
Southern Baptists would change everything.  In the early 1980's there<br>
was paranoia<br>
that Reagan, who had promised so much to the Moral Majority, would soon <br>
bring on the Time of Trouble.  There would have been more if not for the fact<br>
that Reagan's ideology conformed well to most of mid-America conservative<br>
Adventism who worry most about these things.<br>
<p>
People who say SDA's shouldn't be concerned with partisan politics are <br>
ignoring some factors.  In S. Africa in 1988, SDA's (very nonpolitical there)<br>
mostly sat out the election.  In the small district near our college,<br>
Denis Worall, a would-be leader of the opposition, lost by fewer than <br>
500 votes, against one of the apartheid government's chief ministers.<br>
The SDA vote could have been a key force in changing S. Africa.<br>
<p>
In America, especially in a close election, it can be too, and we need<br>
to be informed.  I have made the assertion that none of the three<br>
candidates is <br>
necessarily a friend to religious liberty.  But I don't have much to<br>
back that up.  If people have information on the religious liberty<br>
stands of the <br>
candidates, or other issues which are of interest to SDA's, please let<br>
us know.<br>

When SDA's attempt to analyze the modern phenomena which are commonly <br>
associated by Pentecostal churches as signs of the Holy Spirit, <br>
we have to look back through the filter of history to one specific <br>
incident which comprises most of Ellen White's writing on the topic,<br>
this being the Holy Flesh movement of 1900 in Indiana.<br>
<p>
We spoke quite a bit about the theology of this movement last month<br>
in the "Translation Faith" discussion.  The theology is not heard much <br>
anymore, although the attempted offshoot in Pennsylvania just recently<br>
was spouting some of it.  However, the methods of this movement are <br>
still very much used by Pentecostal churches today (as far as I know.)<br>
<p>
They made much use of instruments, including drums, in their services, <br>
particularly near the end of the service.  They called the experience<br>
"crossing the Jordan", because a person would pass out under the intense<br>
emotional pressure, then the drums would beat and the music would play<br>
until they came to sometime later.  <br>
<p>
Although the theological meaning attached to it is quite different,<br>
the phenomenon seems to be quite similar to todays's "getting slain<br>
in the Spirit."  I have never watched such a procedure, nor do I <br>
particularly wish to,.  I've not heard of such an incident happening<br>
in any Adventist churches (except once at the Seminary chapel when a <br>
visiting Baptist choir came to visit and brought their preacher along with.)<br>
Unfortunately Allen Roy has left the net so we have no Celebration Church<br>
correspondent to tell us whether or not it is happening there.<br>
<p>
I have no evidence that such a procedure is Biblical.  But has anyone ever<br>
seen it happen, or can anyone give us more light on this topic and the<br>
related phenomena?<br>

<p>
huh ?.<br>
<p>
Who discussed it ? I didn't other than to say that we hadn't discussed<br>
it and that as a church I had never heard it taught in my lifetime.<br>
<p>
In fact unless my memory is really faulty we have never really discussed<br>
the theology behind the holy flesh movement and the association it had<br>
with Kellogg's pantheistic theories.<br>

<i>&gt;From: Steve Hix</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Our local public-school district offered a program last year to</i><br>
<i>&gt;"aid" home-school families.</i><br>
<p>
I'm curious as to the reasons behind most people choosing home-schooling.<br>
Is it chosen by those families that live in isolated locations and would<br>
rather their children learn at home than leave home to go to school? Or are<br>
there other categories of people that prefer home-schooling?<br>
<p>
What is the attitude towards home-schooling? Is it generally viewed as a<br>
positive move by SDAs? Or are there some questions about its benefit?<br>

      Micheal is one of three angels named in the Scriptures.  He<br>
      is known as the archangel.  The Jehovah's Witnesses teach that<br>
      Jesus Christ, was once this same Micheal the archangel.  I believe<br>
      I have read somewhere that the SDA church also teaches that Jesus<br>
      and Micheal are one in the same.  The difference is that the JW's<br>
      deny the deity of Christ, while the SDA affirm it.  If necessary,<br>
      I can look up where I saw this.<br>
<p>
      To switch gears, I don't believe Bill Gothard has any children.<br>
      I don't believe he was ever married either.  Steve Timm mentioned<br>
      something about Bill's own son rebelling against him.  Did I take<br>
      something out of context ?<br>

The book, _Defenders of the Faith_, was actually written by Drs. Colin<br>
and Russell Standish, and is commonly circulated by the Our Firm Foundation<br>
crowd, to which both are regular contributors, in fact the book was<br>
serialized in that magazine.  Raylene asked for clarification<br>
on what I had meant when I described his complaint. (Note that I <br>
don't necessarily agree with him.)<br>
<p>
The book describes in some detail the situation in Australia, where<br>
both Standishes were born and raised.  The quote from church official<br>
was "It was so easy to refuse government aid when none was offered."<br>
<p>
Then it turns briefly to the situation of SDA colleges where the financial<br>
aid is given directly to the students, to spend at the college of their choice.<br>
He points out that if a college is to receive these dollars, there are some<br>
criteria it must meet.  Unfortunately I don't remember either what these<br>
criteria are or what he claims they are.<br>

I base my only recollection that Bill Gothard had a son on a radio report<br>
that I heard in 1979 or 1980 when I remember the incident to have happened.<br>
I could be wrong, or else perhaps he has denied mention of having a son<br>
since that time.  <br>

<p>
<i>&gt;So far, though, hardly anyone has complained.  The exception is Colin</i><br>
<i>&gt;Standish, former president of Columbia Union College, in his book</i><br>
<i>&gt;Defenders Of the Faith, who claims that making our colleges essentially</i><br>

I attended the Bill Gothard's conference in Long Beach, California about<br>
10 years ago.  I found his focus on scripture study and personal prayer<br>
very helpful.  However, I personally had a difficult time with the idea<br>
that until I married and had a husband to be my "umbrella of protection",<br>
I should live with my parents with my father fulfilling this role.  This<br>
was his teaching for all single adult women.  The other thing that bothered<br>
me about his approach to spiritual things was that it seemed like "cookbook<br>
spirituality" to me.  He had a "recipe" for everything.  Just follow these<br>
n steps everything will be fine.  He had steps for everything.  If you're<br>
depressed, you probably need to confess a wrong you did years ago as a teen.<br>
If you have conflict with family, you need to confess your lack of respect<br>
to your parents.  BTW.  This doesn't work.  Confessing a lack of respect<br>
for a parent doesn't help you respect them and now they KNOW you don't<br>
because you've told them.<br>
<p>
I had a physician friend who really believed in Bill Gothard's approach.<br>
The idea that he was the "umbrella of protection (i.e. authority)" for<br>
his physician wife broke up his marriage.  He believed he was to be the<br>
final say on everything in his home and would not allow his intelligent<br>
and spiritual wife feel that she could think for herself.  Any doctrine<br>
that delegates personal responsibility to a male figure (father or husband),<br>
can't possibly be the Lord's way.<br>
<p>
BTW.  Bill Gothard was single.  When did he get married and have a son?<br>
I think we should be careful about pointing to one's children and making<br>
a statement about one's credibility based on their childrens' actions.<br>
Remember that George Vandeman's son tried to kill him by stabbing and<br>
has spent years in a mental institution.  Several other prominent SDA<br>
evangelists or church leaders raised some raunchy kids.  In the Bible we<br>
have the prodigal son, Absolom (son of King David), the sons of Jacob<br>
who sold Joseph into slavery.  How about the parents of Cain, the first<br>
murderer who talked with God face to face before the fall?  Esau, the son<br>
of Jacob, was trying to kill his brother, Jacob.  I think the Scriptures<br>
are full of stories of children who didn't turn out as they should.  This<br>
is a lesson to all parents.  That many times spiritual parents raise very<br>
ungodly children.<br>

Seventh-Day-Adventists, in their study of the Bible, find that  Michael  the<br>
Archangel  is  Jesus  the  Commander  in  chief of the heavenly host and not<br>
Himself an angel.  If you can prove from the Bible that Michael  is  a  mere<br>
angel  then  you  have  proved  that  Michael is not Jesus.<br>
<p>
     "For to which of the angels did He ever say: "You are My Son,  today  I<br>
     have begotten You"? And again: "I will be to Him a Father, and He shall<br>
     be to Me a Son"?"  --  Heb 1:5  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
Michael means "one who is like God".  Ancient names give us real clues  into<br>
what  the  named was/is like.  It was Lucifer, the 'morning star' of heaven,<br>
who in his rebellion, desired to be like God.<br>
<p>
     ""How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of  the  morning!  How<br>
     you  are cut down to the ground, you who weakened the nations!  For you<br>
     have said in your heart: 'I will ascend into heaven, I  will  exalt  my<br>
     throne  above  the  stars  of  God; I will also sit on the mount of the<br>
     congregation on the farthest sides of the north;  I will  ascend  above<br>
     the  heights  of  the clouds, I will be like the Most High.' "  --  Isa<br>
     14:12-14  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
     "And He said to them, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from  heaven.  "<br>
     -- Luke 10:18  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
Lucifer's desire to be like God, was a key factor in his fall  from  heaven.<br>
And  yet  it  was  not  rebellion for Jesus to "be like God", to be Michael,<br>
meaning "one who is like God", because  He  is  our  God  and  Savior  Jesus<br>
Christ.   No  one  is like God, in this context, but God Himself.  It should<br>
also now be clear that Lucifer could not possibly have been  Jesus'  brother<br>
in heaven, else Lucifer's desire to be like the Most High would have been as<br>
legitimate as Jesus'.  Considering that the OT sites God as the creator  and<br>
in the NT it makes clear that Jesus is the creator, it is reasonable to con-<br>
clude that Jesus is the creator God who created all the  angels  of  heaven,<br>
including  Lucifer.  It is not possible for the creator to be the brother of<br>
the created.<br>
<p>
Consider the war in heaven:<br>
<p>
     "And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the<br>
     dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they did not prevail,<br>
     nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer.  So the great dra-<br>
     gon  was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who<br>
     deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were<br>
     cast  out  with  him.  Then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, "Now<br>
     salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the  power  of<br>
     His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them<br>
     before our God day and night, has been cast  down."   --   Rev  12:7-10<br>
     (NKJ)<br>
<p>
Who else but a divine power could have taken on Satan successfully and  cast<br>
him from heaven.  The winner of this contest was Christ.<br>
<p>
"Arch" comes from the Greek meaning "ruler", one who reigns over  --  as  in<br>
the  word  "monarch".   To  be the ruler or monarch over the angels does not<br>
make Michael a mere angel.  In Genesis 1:28 we read that God gave man domin-<br>
ion over the creatures of this earth.  That does not make man a mere animal.<br>
Just as saying that the president of the United States is the  Commander  in<br>
Chief of the Armed Forces does not make the president a mere foot soldier or<br>
even a mere general or admiral.  Jesus is the Supreme Commander in Chief  of<br>
the hosts of heaven and our Commander in Chief as well.<br>
<p>
Now consider the story of Joshua meeting his Commander in Chief:<br>
<p>
     "And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that  he  lifted  his<br>
     eyes  and  looked,  and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword<br>
     drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, "Are You for<br>
     us  or  for our adversaries?"  So He said, "No, but as Commander of the<br>
     army of the LORD I have now come." And Joshua fell on his face  to  the<br>
     earth  and  worshiped,  and  said to Him, "What does my Lord say to His<br>
     servant?" Then the Commander of the Lord's army said to  Joshua,  "Take<br>
     your  sandal off your foot, for the place where you stand is holy." And<br>
     Joshua did so." --  Josh 5:13-15  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
The living Bible reads "Commander in Chief".  Clearly the Commander in Chief<br>
of  the  Lord's  army was Jesus in His pre-incarnate form.  Elsewhere in the<br>
Bible we see angels refusing to be worshipped (Rev 19:10; 22:8,9).  The Com-<br>
mander  that  Joshua  met that day accepted Joshua's worship, even commanded<br>
it, declaring the ground to be holy  ground,  which  reminds  us  of  Moses'<br>
experience  at  the  burning bush -- pre-incarnate Jesus again.  Clearly the<br>
commander of the Lord's army is not a mere  angel  but  rather  the  God  of<br>
heaven.<br>
<p>
The following texts make it clear that Michael the Prince  and  Messiah  the<br>
Prince are the same Prince of heaven:<br>
<p>
     ""Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the  com-<br>
     mand  to  restore  and  build Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince, there<br>
     shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; the  street  shall  be  built<br>
     again, and the wall, even in troublesome times."  --  Dan 9:25  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
     ""At that time Michael shall stand up,  the  great  prince  who  stands<br>
     watch  over  the  sons  of  your  people;  And there shall be a time of<br>
     trouble, such as never was since there was a nation, even to that time.<br>
     and at that time your people shall be delivered, every one who is found<br>
     written in the book."  --  Dan 12:1  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
     ""When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels  with<br>
     Him,  then  He  will  sit  on  the throne of His glory."  --  Mat 25:31<br>
     (NKJ)<br>
<p>
     ""Most assuredly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and  now  is,  when<br>
     the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will<br>
     live. "For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son<br>
     to  have life in Himself, "and has given Him authority to execute judg-<br>
     ment also, because He is the Son of Man.  "Do not marvel at  this;  for<br>
     the  hour  is  coming  in which all who are in the graves will hear His<br>
     voice"  "and come forth; those who have done good, to the  resurrection<br>
     of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemna-<br>
     tion."  --  John 5:25- 29  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
     "For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout,  with  the<br>
     voice  of  an  archangel,  and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in<br>
     Christ will rise first."  --  1 Th 4:16  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
Jesus = Messiah the Prince = Michael the Prince, the one who will return  to<br>
take us home with Him.<br>
<p>
A common text offered in rebuttal is Jude 1:9<br>
<p>
     "Yet Michael the archangel, in  contending  with  the  devil,  when  he<br>
     disputed  about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a revil-<br>
     ing accusation, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!""  --  Jude 1:9  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
The Bible is clear that Satan is the accuser and reviler (Rev  12:10).   God<br>
would  not  stoop to the methods of Satan.  Here is a text that presents the<br>
same circumstances in the Old Testament:<br>
<p>
     "And the LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, Satan! The LORD  who<br>
     has  chosen  Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the<br>
     fire?""  --  Zec 3:2  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
Also consider Jesus' language in rebuking Satan:<br>
<p>
     "Jesus said to him, "It is written again, 'You shall not tempt the LORD<br>
     your  God.'  " "--  Mat 4:7  (NKJ)  "Then Jesus said to him, "Away with<br>
     you, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the  LORD  your  God,<br>
     and Him only you shall serve.' " "--  Mat 4:10  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
Clearly, in rebuking Satan, Jesus identifies Himself  before  Satan  as  the<br>
"Lord  your  God".   Matthew  4 is never used to prove that Jesus is not our<br>
Lord. In Jude 1:9, Michael is not calling upon the Lord to rebuke Satan  but<br>
rather Michael is the Lord Himself rebuking Satan.<br>
<p>
Michael our Supreme Commander in Chief will come with the  hosts  of  heaven<br>
and  all  power  over  the grave.  He will come with the angels of heaven to<br>
take us home to paradise that He has been preparing for us.<br>
<p>
     " "In My Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so,  I  would<br>
     have  told  you.  I  go  to  prepare a place for you.  "And if I go and<br>
     prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you  to  Myself;<br>
     that where I am, there you may be also. "--  John 14:2,3  (NKJ)<br>

FYI,<br>
<p>
When I attended Bill Gothard's Youth Conference in 1982, he was unmarried,<br>
had never been married, and had never been a father.  This was the very<br>
reason many people questioned his approach to the family because he had\<br>
never experienced or tried them himself.  Any new report you may remember<br>
hearing in 1979/80 could not have been accurate.<br>

<i>&gt; 1)  I thought that this group was essentially out of business now, the </i><br>

<i>&gt; they still actually giving seminars?</i><br>
<p>
Between my wife and I, we have attended IBLP seminars fairly regularly<br>
since 1973.  The incidence in 1980 that may be in your mind is when there<br>
were problems with one of Bill's brothers (as someone else mentioned, Bill<br>
has never been married).  Bill stepped out of IBLP (previously known as IBYC)<br>
presentations for one year in order to minister to his family's needs.<br>
As for being out of business, quite the contrary: IBLP seminar attendance<br>
is growing by leaps and bounds; seminars have recently been given in<br>
Australia, New Zealand, Europe and Russia.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2)  The view of "chain of command" as he presents it is in my opinion</i><br>
<i>&gt; not Biblically based, but rather designed to enforce in the minds of parents</i><br>
<i>&gt; with problems that they must be right after all.</i><br>
<p>
Given the fairly large body of relevant Scripture on authority, I have<br>
difficulty agreeing with you.  Can you suggest another Scriptural model?<br>
<p>
We should remember to give him the same space for growth that we would<br>
like for ourselves.  For perhaps the first 10 years of seminars, "chain<br>
of command" stood alone and probably rubbed some people the wrong way.<br>
Since around 1978, the Basic Seminar includes material on making appeals<br>
to authority (and ultimately God; see Prov 21:1) which balances the<br>
material on authority.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3)  He damaged his credibility seriously by making a number of false</i><br>
<i>&gt; accusations against Christian recording artists.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure what you have in mind, but my personal experience and<br>
observations make me inclined to agree with him re rock music.  I have his<br>
materials on rock and would be willing to post them (they are free of<br>
copyright) so that folk can make their own judgements.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Gothard is part of the Christian parapsychology which arose in the 70's</i><br>
<i>&gt; and early 80's, baptizing worldly concepts and clinging to them when the </i><br>
<i>&gt; world of psychology had long since abandoned them because research had</i><br>
<i>&gt; shown them to be false.  </i><br>
<p>
I'll take the Word of God over the word of man any day; "proofs" from<br>
psychology research do not carry much weight with me.  Here and there they<br>
may stumble across some truth, but, in general, they are foolish (in the<br>
sense of Proverbs).  Rom 8:7a is a law and a truism.  One's morality<br>
practically dictates one's theology/philosophy; a lot of the "psych"<br>
greats were really messed up, into spiritism, etc.  (EGW has some very<br>
pointed comments about these guys.)<br>
<p>
I do not always agree with Gothard (e.g., eschatology) but have always<br>
found his ideas to be based upon Scripture (i.e., I may differ over<br>
interpretation or feel that other relevant verses, when taken as a whole,<br>
lead to a different conclusion).  I cannot agree with "baptizing worldly<br>
concepts", sorry.<br>
<p>
The vast majority of Christians (even SDA's 8-) I know who have attended<br>
have expressed their appreciation for Gothard's seminars.  I would encourage<br>
critics to hold their peace until they have attended at least the Basic<br>
Seminar.<br>

Recently my uncle, a SDA Theology scholar, told me he has come to the<br>
conclusion that Jesus the Son is also God the Father--they are One person.<br>
They seems to be considerable Scriptural evidence to back up this conclusion.<br>
Do all SDAs believe this or do you believe differently?<br>

[I have never heard this view expressed by an SDA theologian before, unless<br>
it was very early SDA stuff before the church came around to the mainline<br>
doctrine of the Trinity.  I certainly don't believe that myself, and <br>
it contradicts the Statement of Fundamental Beliefs.  There is, however,<br>
some very interesting Bible study surrounding the topic, and I had planned<br>
to bring it up myself later this month.  If anyone has any insight, <br>
please share.  SCT]<br>

Please forgive me if this is a bit messy.  We have mentally ill person who<br>
has been attending some of our Sabbath services and has been disturbing<br>
some of the people, particularlly at pot luck.  At the most recent board<br>
meeting one member mentioned how if he came back they wanted him sent<br>
away.  The man who comes is schizonphrenic probably and obviously very<br>
very paranoid.  He has been by here before, and we have helped him to get<br>
where  he wanted to go at least once.  I have been trying to think of<br>
something meaningful we could do for the man, but I am at a loss.    Any<br>
recommendations? <br>

I attended a Bill Gothard seminar around 20 years ago.  I enjoyed it.  I<br>
have not attended one since however.  I don't know the status of Bill's<br>
ministry, but I do know that it must still be active to some extent as<br>
I have received a birthday card from it consistently for the last twenty<br>
years including two months ago.  I would conclude that his ministry must<br>
still be active.<br>

Our personal experience with home schooling is that it is the best<br>
option available for those who have that option.<br>
<p>
I recall a radio host interviewing the author of a book on how their<br>
family had home schooled.  They home schooled all the way up through<br>
highschool.  The idea was to go to college to get acredited for what<br>
they had learned.  The biggest problem their children had was that<br>
college was too easy.  The author explained that in public school<br>
(somewhat similar in church school) teachers are so bogged down with<br>
required paper work and large classes that its easy for a mediocre<br>
parent to out perform a top notch teacher in terms of the benefit<br>
to the individual student.<br>
<p>
Another story, of a girl home schooling.  The local school district<br>
threatened them . . . . came up with the idea of testing her and<br>
if she fell below expectations for 4th grade, she would have to<br>
go to public school.  She scored as being 6th grade proficient.  So,<br>
the school district insisted she had to be placed in public school<br>
in order to take their excelleration problem so she could excellerate<br>
to 6th grade where they felt she belonged according to the test<br>
scores.<br>
<p>
We have not done home school on a steady basis.  A year here and there.<br>
Our boys have done remarkably better the year following home school.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What is the attitude towards home-schooling? Is it generally viewed as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; positive move by SDAs? Or are there some questions about its benefit?</i><br>
<p>
We get most of our flack from one of the retired pastors in our church<br>
and some from the pastor.  Some of our pastors have filed away very<br>
strong sermons on sending your children to church school instead of<br>
public school and they have a hard time seeing the difference between<br>
home school and public school.  But frankly, I place home school, if<br>
its an option, as the top most of choices.  I have yet to find anything<br>
in EGW to contradict that, rather her strong endorsement.<br>

I must make a reply to Steve's reporting of what happened at Carnegie<br>
Mellon University regarding the Gospel Choir and funding, in order to<br>
clarify the issue--I believe that it is now slightly obscurred.  <br>
<p>
It was reported in the university paper (The Tartan) that the VUGC<br>
(Voices United Gospel Choir) would be deprived of its funding until<br>
further review on the religoius nature of the organization.  A student<br>
senator leading the charge, was quoted as saying that he did not want to<br>
fund anything on campus that would be offensive to others.  This was<br>
obviously faulty logic; a logic that really should not exist on a<br>
university campus promoting freedom of expression  and exploration.  <br>
Steve Timm made a reply to the paper pointing out the ridiculousness of<br>
what this student senator had said (basically showing that anything<br>
could be considered as offensive and therefore nothing funded).  In the<br>
same paper the senator retracted his statement as to WHY the VUGC should<br>
not be funded, and gave more of the history of the VUGC and the events<br>
precipitating the action (in reality, I think he was rather embarrassed<br>
about what he said realizing its implication).<br>
<p>
Apparently, the student senate has a set of bylaws that does not fund<br>
ANY religious or political organization.  These organizations are not<br>
barred from existing, they just cannot receive senate funding.  Further,<br>
it was reported to the student senate that the VUGC was essentially<br>
operating as a front for evangalizing people to christianity, NOT merely<br>
singing gospel music.  Albeit there are student senators who would like<br>
to get rid of VUGC just because it does sing christian music, the basis<br>
for the senate's action was that it was not just merely singing but<br>
envangelizing.<br>
<p>
The logic of their argument is that if they fund VUGC, they could not<br>
refuse to fund the KKK, College Democrats, College Republicans (no<br>
implication that any of these are related) etc.  <br>
<p>
It should be noted that the paper wrote an editorial against the senate<br>
on how this matter was handled and asked them to clarify issues with<br>
student organizations and to fully investigate charges against a student<br>
organization instead of freezing funds immediately on an unsubstantiated<br>
accusation only. There has been an investigation but I don't know what<br>
the outcome was.  Steve seems to have been closer to this.  <br>
<p>
 From the senate's position as I understand it, VUGC can maintain its<br>
funding ONLY if it shows that it is SINGING gospel music and not using<br>
the occasion to practice christianity or evangelize.  For some people,<br>
these go hand in hand, but it IS possible to sing gospel music solely<br>
for its musicalness and not as a tool for conversion.<br>
<p>
Steve states that many who led the charge against VUGC didn't even like<br>
the fact that the songs were christian, and THAT was their basis. <br>
However, I don't think this was the reason why the senate stopped the<br>
funding.<br>
<p>
Steve's conclustion that PCer's are not his friend is true.  His<br>
conclusion that the student senate fits this category I think is false.  <br>

[Since I'm reading this post from Fermilab and have not yet seen <br>
the issue of the Tartan Trevor refers to, I have to take his word for it.<br>

With the return of Paul Gates to the net and the addition of Lenson <br>
Wong of Berkeley, we have climbed to 101 subscribers, the first time <br>
in the history of SDAnet we have been this high.  Within the past two <br>
weeks we have also added our first member from Africa  (C. Chibafa from <br>
Zimbabwe) and our first from South America (Sergio Munoz of Chile).<br>
(SDA-L has had members from S. America for quite some time.)<br>
<p>
This leaves Antarctica as the only continent where SDAnet does not have<br>
 a presence.  Any volunteers?<br>

Here at University of Wisconsin, we have an interesting situation.  State<br>
law prohibits the existance of student associations which are political in<br>
nature but religious associations are totally acceptable.  At the Student<br>
Union on any given day, there may be a meeting of Lutheran, Baptist, LDS,<br>
Catholic, Unitarian, or Muslim students.  The only requirement is that the<br>
student association be "registered" with Office of Student Life and at<br>
least four legitimate student names and addresses be included on the form.<br>
Rooms in the Student Union may be reserved for use by any registered<br>
student club or association.  People from the community may attend and<br>
clubs are prohibited from discriminating in who can attend a meeting.  The<br>
LDSSA (LDS student Association) welcomes anyone who wants to attend.  We're<br>
studying the Writings of Luke and meet every Tuesday Noon.  Does the<br>
University "fund" this activity?  No, but we do get free use of a meeting<br>
room.  What is the situation at your state university?<br>

<i>&gt;We have mentally ill person who</i><br>
<i>&gt;has been attending some of our Sabbath services and has been disturbing</i><br>
<i>&gt;some of the people, particularlly at pot luck.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Ian.</i><br>
<p>
Avondale College, being in a rural location, finds itself in the area of<br>
a couple of homes for the mentally ill. There have been a number of people<br>
from these homes, over the years, who have found Avondale College to be a<br>
nice place to be (things always happening socially etc etc). And they have <br>
often been seen at church.<br>
<p>
One looks as though he has suffered burns to his face at one time. He is<br>
often seen wandering the streets and came to early church (run before Sabbath<br>
School) quite consistently. He also turned up to Friday night meetings with<br>
all the students and once gave a very touching testimony.<br>
<p>
Another paced consistently around outside the church mumbling to himself in<br>
a cloud of cigarette smoke (that probably was the most off-putting bit). He<br>
also came inside the church (didn't smoke there fortunately) and when there<br>
was no program on could be seen pacing the aisles mumbling hail mary's to<br>
himself and asking when was mass to be performed.<br>
<p>
The third is a very large guy (though not so tall) who rolls his R's very<br>
strongly. He is very friendly and has been known to start walking at 8:00am<br>
to church functions in the bush. He frequently attends the church fellowship<br>
lunch and eats phenomenal amounts of food. He has also recently been baptised<br>
and included by some of the church members - given little jobs to do so he<br>
can feel involved.<br>
<p>
As a woman I want to keep away because I don't know what to do when they<br>
look at my top shirt button instead of my eyes.<br>
As a *Christian* I feel impelled to accept these people and be friendly to <br>
them. Others have obviously made the effort.<br>
In reality I have done nothing. Then I feel that the King's banquet is for<br>
them and not for me!?<br>
<p>
Is there an answer?<br>
<p>

Isn't it interesting that SDAs like to criticize educational<br>
institutions for their emphasis on book learning, while at the<br>
same time the benefits of home schooling are discussed in terms<br>
of academic performance.<br>
<p>
I'm not having a go at anyone here, because I certainly believe<br>
that aspect is important. However my personal concerns with home<br>
schooling are more in the area of socialization.<br>
<p>
Now there is an argument that says we don't want our children<br>
socialized into modern Western culture. I can see the point in<br>
trying to ensure that as they grow up the adopt the appropriate<br>
values, and that many of these are not widely held today.<br>
<p>
I am not confident that after years of home schooling a person<br>
would really know how to relate to their peer group, or even to<br>
the general public as a whole. This to me is a serious factor,<br>
and is almost enough to convince me that I am not in favour of<br>
home schooling.<br>
<p>
The idea of home schooling interleaved with regular schooling<br>
would negate this to a large degree, and I was interested to<br>
read about that. I myself was home-schooled for one year only,<br>
and although I felt "out of it" with my peers, I survived due<br>
to already being a member of a social group, and going back<br>
to school the year after.<br>
<p>
Surely anything EGW had to say on home schooling would have to<br>
be read with the understanding that it was written under very<br>
different social conditions. Modern education is very different<br>
to that of the Victorian era, and modern lifestyles are very<br>
different as well. Didn't many students in those days end up<br>
living at school instead of with their families? Having<br>
a child living at home, attending a Christian school for a few<br>
hours a day, and the rest of the time being under the direct <br>
influence of Godly parents, seems to fit with EGWs ideas on a<br>
worthwhile education.<br>

Well, Steve,<br>
since I am from Chile and Chileans --as well as others-- have territorial<br>
claims over the Antartic, we may just well say that for as long as there<br>
are Chileans, there will be Antarticans, at least to some extent, in the<br>
net.  :-)<br>

Personally I see the doctrine of the trinity as yet another situation<br>
where God is trying to explain something to me that I cannot possibly<br>
understand. He is giving me a simple description of some aspects of his<br>
being, simple enough to be meaningful to my limited mind.<br>
<p>
I think it is more important to ask "what does the doctrine of the<br>
trinity have to say" than to make statements about whether God is<br>
"really" made up of three distinct components. One important thing<br>
that the doctrine says, for example, is that Jesus is God.<br>
<p>
We're setting ourselves up for a certain amount of embarrassment on<br>
the day that we see these things for ourselves if we try to make too<br>
much of it at this stage.<br>

I was interested in the comments about mentally ill attending church services<br>
and sometimes bothering people.  Mental Illness is still misunderstood by<br>
most Christians and there seems to be the tendency to exclude them, avoid<br>
them, and keep them from bothering others.  At the Wasatch Hills SDA Church<br>
in Salt Lake City (where I attended before I converted to Mormonism), we<br>
have several "strange" individuals who attended regularly.  One was a<br>
"homeless" person who begged on the streets during the week and then attended<br>
SDA church services on Saturday.  If it was a potluck day, he didn't miss!<br>
Another was a very outspoken and perhap "obnoxious" soul who would contantly<br>
interrupt the Sabbath School lesson with extraneous remarks and inappropriate<br>
comments.  Yet the church never discouraged them from coming and in fact<br>
provided transportation for them to attend.<br>
<p>
I have a sister who has been committed to state mental institutions many times<br>
and for the past 5 years has been in a board and care facility for the<br>
mentally ill.  She attended Church with my parents every week.  Her clothes<br>
smelled of cigarette smoke and sometimes she would walk out to the parking<br>
lot to have a smoke during services and return to sit by my parents.  All<br>
out lives, we sibs tried hard to conceal the problem.  I remember refusing<br>
to sit with my family as an adult because I felt ashamed and embarrassed.<br>
She didn't always disturb the class but sometimes she would make a weird<br>
comment.  If there was punch and cookies after services, she would go to<br>
the table and stuff her purse with cookies to take home for her "friends"<br>
at the home where she lived.  We tried very hard to "control" her but to<br>
no avail.  Yet my father felt very committed to her and always went to<br>
pick her up to attend services.  Through this experience and the great<br>
love my own parents had for my sister, I have witnessed what God's love<br>
must be like.  How repulsive our sin and selfishness must be to our Elder<br>
Brother!  Yet He does not withdraw from us.  He cradles us in His arms of<br>
love and identifies with fallen man.<br>
<p>
I have a much more philosophical view now of the purpose of church<br>
attendence and what to do about disturbances in church.  The elderly<br>
resent young children and babies crying and many members don't know what<br>
to do about "strange and different" people.  Isn't it selfish for us to<br>
feel that the services are there for our personal spiritual benefit?  My<br>
sister rarely had meaningful contacts during the week.  Yet she knew that<br>
on Sabbath, she could enjoy spiritual music, love and understanding from<br>
Christians, and hear the Word of God.  It meant so much to her that she<br>
would walk 5 miles to attend if my parents where out of town.  The mentally<br>
ill are the downtrodden of this society.  They are "loathsome" than common<br>
criminals.  Yet they did nothing to deserve this from society.  They were<br>
born with a physical defect in their brains which cause the bizarre and<br>
repugnant behavior.  I think the mercy and kindness Jesus Christ showed<br>
to Lepers and Demoniacs should demonstrate how we are to treat the<br>
schizophrenics and manic-depressives of this earth.<br>

All kidding aside, there *is* an internet node or two on Antartica.<br>
I believe they use a 9600 baud satellite channel to contact the northern<br>
world.<br>

At Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh, our association<br>
(whenever it meets, which is seldom) is allowed to use rooms on campus.<br>
At the University of Pittsburgh we are also afforded office space and <br>
the option (which we have not exercised) of hiring on Work-study workers.<br>

AMEN, Cheryl!   May we all have the strength and wisdom to exhibit that<br>
kind of love.  It does not come naturally, but it is the real evidence<br>
of true Christianity.<br>

Steve<br>
<p>
There is a group of independent ministries (I believe) who call<br>
themselves "Light Bearers" and have been publishing a lot of literature<br>
and distributing extensively especially here in Africa . I believe one<br>
of their members is a man by the name of T. Gibson .<br>
<p>
I just wanted to know about their relationship to the Church now as I am<br>
made to understand through a document issured by the Bible Research<br>
Institute in 1989 (May I think) that their work was not endorsed by the<br>
Church .<br>
<p>
Help on this issue would be greatly appreciated as it has caused a lot<br>
of mis-understandings within churches here , especially in Harare , with<br>
members not sure whether their literature should be distributed in the<br>
name of the Church .<br>

On the concept of a Trinity:<br>
<p>
As strange as it may seem, I think that an understanding of the<br>
Trinity paradox cannot be achieved without the aid of mathematics.<br>
Anyone who has read Flatland by Edwin Abbott will know what I mean.<br>
<p>
The Bible seems to be trying to teach us to think of God as Three<br>
Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  At the same time, it is clear<br>
that these Three think of Themselves as One Person.  Under what<br>
circumstances would that dichotomy of perspectives makes sense?<br>
<p>
An analogy will help set the stage for my answer.  Imagine that you<br>
discovered a two dimensional universe (flat ... like a sheet of paper)<br>
in which shadow-like beings moved about under your gaze.  At a glance,<br>
you could see both their outsides (perimeters) and their insides<br>
(interiors).  You would have a God-like perspective on their world<br>
and, by approaching from above (a notion that the flatlanders could<br>
never comprehend), you could appear and disappear by "touching down" at <br>
various points in their universe.  You could also remain invisible by<br>
hovering above their plane.  You could do surgery without cutting<br>
through their skins (perimeters).  You could work miracles.<br>
<p>
Suppose that you set down three fingers in their world.  From their<br>
point of view, each finger would look like a different "being".  From<br>
your point of view, it's just one hand.  The thing is a 3-dimensional<br>
hand is beyong their powers of imagination, being 2-dimensional<br>
creatures.<br>
<p>
Reasoning by analogy (always dangerous), suppose that God is a <br>
4 or higher dimensional Being.  Compared to Him, we would be as<br>
insubstantial as the 2-dimensional shadows would appear to us.  He<br>
could perform miracles by virtue of His higher dimensionality.  And,<br>
from His point of view, God is One, while to us, They are Three.<br>
<p>
I have no idea whether God is indeed a 4 or higher dimensional Being.<br>
All I am saying is that the kinds of miracles reported in the Bible<br>
and the statements God makes about Himself are consistent with such<br>
a model.  And if He is as I think, a higher dimensional Being, then even<br>
in eternity, we will be mere shadows of His glory.  <br>
<p>
For interested readers, I do recommend Flatland.  It's easy reading<br>
by a 19th century mathematics teacher and theologian at a London<br>
teacher's college.  You can find it in most libraries.<br>

Cheryl mentions that at the U of Wisconsin church organizations are permitted to<br>
use university facilities free of charge.  The same is true at Purdue Universit.<br>
<p>
Our Adventist student organization has held numerous meetings on campus.  I <br>
believe that the situation here is essentially equivalent to that which Cheryl <br>
describes, with the exception that Purdue allows political organization the <br>
same priveleges as religious ones.<br>

Thanks for the replies so far.  First, I will say that I have considered<br>
demon possession.  Second, I liked what Cherly had to say.  When Terry<br>
comes to church he wanders in and out of the building most of the time. <br>
He picks up a few EGW books so that he can hand them out.  He asks you<br>
whether you area Christian or a church member more than once.  He opens<br>
windows and turns off lights (fresh air is good and electricity is bad for<br>
one's health.  He talks about the "they" that is after him.  Occasionally<br>
he will be mischievious (which is what got him in trouble with someone at<br>
the business meeting).  The specific incident was his telling someone at<br>
pot luck he had AIDS and then proceeding to stick his fingers in the food.<br>
 I gather that in the past he might have been in some care facilities, but<br>
he doesn't look to favorably on the experience.  I say all of this just to<br>
give you a bit more background.  I  keep praying for some  type of good<br>
solution.<br>
<p>
Ian.<br>

Tony, I have done a study on the trinity and related subjects. Christ is<br>
also referred as Judge. From my personal study and belief of what the<br>
Bible says I still believe that the trinity are 3 separate beings. There<br>
may be many that would disagree with that approach and you may too.<br>
However, I have settled it for myself.<br>
<p>

Dave,<br>
<p>
what you had to say was great. It's strange, but it seems that mathematics<br>
and science can often be useful when it comes to coping with some concepts<br>
in theology! An understanding of the scientific (or mathematical) model, and<br>
a willingness to apply it in things apart from science, seems to be very<br>
worthwhile.<br>
<p>
My ex-mathematics lecturer at Avondale College, Dr. Wilf Pinchin, had a copy<br>
of "Flatland" sitting on his desk the other week. It looked fascinating, but<br>
I didn't borrow it at the time due to a large research project which was<br>
looming over my head. It sounds like it's worth reading!<br>

Paul Johnston reporting<br>
<p>
<p>
PITTSBURGH--This network has had some discussion on a reported incident at <br>
Shadyside SDA Church in Pittsburgh.  No one who's written about it so far was<br>
 there at the time.  For those of you who've followed the correspondence, here <br>
are some additional facts from one who was there.<br>
<p>
<p>
The church board was consulted by the senior pastor of Shadyside several weeks<br>
 in advance of the proposed date with the choir.  He carefully made no <br>
recommendation.  He asked the board to discuss and vote on the return of these <br>
regular visitors.  (By the way, it's almost impossible to get Blue Mountain <br>
Academy or Columbia Union College to send groups here.)  Shadyside's board is <br>
a highly representative body, cutting across the congregation's diverse <br>
subsets.  On the<br>
 whole, the board is more cautious and conservative than the pastoral staff.<br>
<p>
<p>
I was at that board meeting.  It was a unanimous decision to invite <br>
Shippenburg's musicians back.  The pastor, surprised I think, asked again if <br>
everyone realised that this meant the drums and electric bass would be back <br>
too.  Yes, the board knew that.  Some members said that, though the music <br>
wasn't always to their taste, that was no reason to be ungrateful.  A year <br>
before, when the choir brought a similar program, no one had raised a scene.<br>
  The board did not anticipate one this time either.<br>
<p>
<p>
True enough, the makeup of the congregation hadn't changed much in a year.  <br>
But what was underestimated by the board was the potential behavior by one <br>
new arrival, a former pastor.  He--his presence, his personality, his tactics-<br>
-was the one and only significantly different factor.<br>
<p>
<p>
It has been reported elsewhere on this network that some of the congregation's<br>
 younger members were seeking to consider disfellowshipping this ex-pastor<br>
 (back in Pittsburgh after being booted out of another conference). <br>
[Paul supplied an alternate wording for the following sentences at my request<br>
SCT]<br>
In contrast to one of our previous correspondents, I have not heard young <br>
adults--or old--discussing disfellowship; however, I have heard mention of <br>
censorship, a somewhat different action, among church members.<br>
<p>
One correspondent wrote that it's "our duty to affirm this man as our brother"<br>
 and that there must be "some way to open a channel of communication with him.<br>
"  The pastoral staff and board have gone the extra mile to try and do just <br>
that.  But the attempt has been frustrated.  Speaking personally, as Sabbath <br>
School superintendent, I reached out.  When he returned to Pittsburgh, he was <br>
obviously a hurting man.  My wife and I entertained him and his wife in our <br>
home.  With my encouragement and the blessings of the pastors and board, the <br>
Sabbath School Council invited him to be one of our Sabbath School class <br>
teachers.  We felt he needed something positive and constructive to do.  He <br>
has gone on to use that forum for critical and undermining work with a small <br>
(and diminishing) group of people.  The biggest concern of all those I know is<br>
 that he's about to self-destruct.<br>
<p>
<p>
The ex-pastor's behavior is not exclusively, or even initially, the concern of<br>
 young adult members.  The board is about one-third young adults.  But the <br>
dismay and disillusionment with this man is all-inclusive.  The flap over the <br>
music was not and is not a young versus old issue.  It's not a liberal versus<br>
 conservative issue.  For example, most of Shadyside's symphony-goers are from<br>
 the young professional subset.  Young adults on the board have, in fact, been<br>
 among the most critical about poor management of change--including <br>
Shadyside's liturgical and musical trends.  The folks who feel most <br>
comfortable with what's happening are newer converts, by no means a young <br>
group of people in our case.<br>
<p>
<p>
By the way, this is just one cloud in Shadyside Church's life.  Overall, <br>
miraculous things are happening and many are finding it to be a rewarding <br>
place to be on Saturday mornings.  The community is starting to notice it.  <br>
There have been positive articles in newspapers and a good review of its <br>
services on WQED-FM's "Sunday Arts Magazine."  I think you'd like our<br>
 potlucks too.<br>
<p>
<p>
[The "correspondent" so obliquely referred to by Paul is none other than <br>
myself.  I too wish to make clear that any references to disfellowshipping<br>
were only wishful thinking and no move has been organized to carry that out.<br>

<i>&gt;DaveB</i><br>
<i>&gt;Our personal experience with home schooling is that it is the best</i><br>
<i>&gt;option available for those who have that option.</i><br>
<p>
One of the reasons why I questioned home-schooling in the first place was<br>
because of an experience I had while practice teaching a few years ago.<br>
<p>
There was a girl in one of my classes who had not gone to school because her<br>
parents had been caught up in some conservative movement that questioned<br>
the morality and spirituality of both state and SDA schools. When I saw<br>
her she had just begun school against her parents wishes.<br>
<p>
She was a 16 year old girl in a class of 14 year olds. She was a very nice, <br>
cooperative student, and aimed to please.I don't know how she was going in <br>
English or History but I know how she was going in Mathematics and Science:<br>
she had no knowledge of these subjects at a high school level at all.<br>
Her maths teacher was giving her a lot of individual tutoring, starting with<br>
topics from the first year of high school. In science, it was very much the<br>
same. I would be conducting a practical class in science and needed to be<br>
constantly giving her that extra bit of assistance.<br>
<p>
At the time I felt it was very unfair of her parents to put her in that<br>
position at that age. When I was 16 my parents encouraged me towards<br>
academic achievement, and I believed that it was my Christian responsibility<br>
(and a few other things) to work at achieving in school. I felt this girl<br>
had been given an unfair disadvantage. What chance did she have, in one year,<br>
of catching up all that she had missed? And if she couldn't catch up then<br>
her career options would be greatly limited. As a science teacher in training,<br>
and realizing how much I had learned as opposed to how little MY parents knew<br>
on the subject (though I do believe they could pick it up and that content<br>
isn't the be all and end all) I questioned the ability of parents to teach <br>
these subjects. Though my concern was limited more to the topics covered in <br>
the last two years of high-school more than anything prior to that.<br>
<p>
At the same time I thought that her parents may have decided that academic<br>
performance was not what was important in life and what she gained would by<br>
far outweigh what she lost. What good is a good education if it means you<br>
have to forfeit eternal life for instance? <br>
<p>
This may be one of the few disaster stories of homeschooling, I don't know.<br>
But it really got me thinking. <br>
<p>
Obviously schools are not the best places. I know that. I went to school.<br>
But I highly value education, and I feel that if I had not done as I have then<br>
there would be people in the Chemistry Department at the University of<br>
Newcastle that would have less of a contact with Christianity and basically no<br>
contact with Adventism.<br>
<p>
What wisdom have others got to offer on the subject?<br>

I too from time to time have thought about how mathematical concepts<br>
and physical laws can be used to describe God.  <br>
<p>
For those that don't know any group theory, you won't understand it,<br>
and it's not clear that even I know what I'm talking about,<br>
but could it be that in the various representations of God in the Bible,<br>
we are simply seeing different representations of the same symmetry<br>
group that describes God?<br>
<p>
For instance the "One God" of Exodus is the unitary representation,<br>
the trinity is the 3 representation, the 10 commandments are yet another,<br>
and the Shemat Yisroel  "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy <br>
heart and all thy soul and all thy mind" yet another?<br>

      I have done quite a bit of study on this topic.  The best I understand<br>
    this.  There is but one God.  Not three gods. Not two gods, and certainly<br>
    not many gods as the Mormons believe.  This One God has manifested<br>
    Himself to us in Three persons.  The term person I have heard is not the<br>
    best term to use, but its difficult to come up with one better.  These<br>
    3 persons are distinct.  But all three are fully God.  Each one is not<br>
    1/3 God, but each is fully God.  Many times the Jehovah's Witnesses will<br>
    say "Oh..so was Jesus Praying to Himself in the garden of Gethsemane?"<br>
    Their questions isn't an honest question, but a sort of mockery of the<br>
    orthodox position of the Trinity.  Jesus, the Son ( a distinct ) person<br>
    was praying to His Father ( a distinct person ).  I admit the mystery is<br>
    great, but these 2 distinct personalities are both God.  Not half but,<br>
    fully God.  If we say there are then 2 gods, we then become polytheists.<br>
    The Scriptures teach that there is one, and only one God.  There are three<br>
    persons who are referred to as this One God.<br>
<p>
    Well, I have babbled enough...<br>
    Eric Snyder<br>

DaveB writes, "But frankly, I place home school, if its an option, as the top <br>
most of choices.  I have yet to find anything in EGW to contradict that, <br>
rather her strong endorsement."<br>
<p>
I recently ran across an article in a Adventist Review from the 1970's which <br>
was a transcript of a message Ellen White gave to the school board at <br>
Sanitarium, CA. I am in the process of getting a copy from a teacher friend of<br>
mine and when I do, I will post the reference. In that talk Ellen White <br>
indicated that when she made statements about keeping children out of school <br>
until they were 10 or so there were no Sabbath keeping schools in existence. <br>
She goes on to say that if there exists a Sabbath keeping school there is no <br>
reason to keep our children out of them. This article, I think, reveals the <br>
necessity of putting the statements of Ellen White into their historical <br>
context.<br>

P.S. This is an important issue to me because I have 6 year old twin boys that<br>
started school this year.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
Now personally, I have not worried too much about this issue yet,<br>
seeing as I haven't needed to.<br>
<p>
Yet I believe it is significant that Jesus and John the Baptist were<br>
both  home-schooled. In fact the rest of his brothers and the priests <br>
often complained to Mary that Jesus was out of line for not attending <br>
the synagogue schools.<br>
<p>
Was Jesus' time really all that different from now ?<br>
<p>
Ruben.<br>

We recently discussed availability of rooms and such on college campuses.<br>
One fact that is not widely known among SDA's is that there is a great<br>
deal of opportunities available on public high school campuses due to the <br>
Equal Access law.  My understanding of that act is that public schools must<br>
allow the same access for church groups in after school hours as they do<br>
for any other group.  This gives opportunities for outreach on high<br>
school campi which by and large are being ignored by our church's youth <br>
leaders (myself included).  <br>
<p>
Closely related to this is the Youth To Youth program.  (Old SDA hacks knew<br>
this as A.Y.B.L.)  Dr. Patricia Mutch of Andrews University has been a <br>
leader in developing the Adventist Youth to Youth program to be a <br>
counterpart of the Youth to Youth program which goes on in public schools.<br>
The chief aims of Youth to Youth are to show that one can have fun and<br>
celebrate in a drug-free lifestyle, and to develop positive peer<br>
pressure. <br>
<p>
The combination of the Youth to Youth program and Listen magazine<br>
provides powerful outreach tools.  I would like to see it happen in my <br>
city, unfortunately the money is often prohibitive to get it going.  <br>
Has anyone had experience with this or other equal-access programs in <br>
the area in which they live?<br>

Ty Gibson and Light Bearers used to catch a lot of conference flack<br>
for accepting tithe and so were banned from church pulpits, for<br>
example in the Oregon Conference.  Recently they came to terms with<br>
their local conference and issued a letter announcing that they<br>
would no longer accept tithe.  Soon after that the Oregon Conference<br>
took them off the "black list".<br>

<i>&gt; I'm not having a go at anyone here, because I certainly believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; that aspect is important. However my personal concerns with home</i><br>
<i>&gt; schooling are more in the area of socialization.</i><br>
<p>
Our younger son is home schooling 8th grade.  We have two church<br>
schools about equal distance from us.  One school has a somewhat<br>
active home school support program where, for a very reasonable fee,<br>
home schoolers can participate in a wide variety of school activities,<br>
such as field trips to the zoo, science fair, etc.  We made similar<br>
arrangements with the other school so that he can show up for recess any<br>
time he likes, etc.  He is also playing bass clarinet in the academy band.<br>
So, his social life is rather full.<br>

 From time to time people request distribution of SDAnet in a digest<br>
form.  I always say that I would do it if there was enough demand, but<br>
would prefer not to because it would be a horrible amount of work.<br>
Currently I try to send out all the messages in a group in the morning,<br>
and then once again in the evening.  It is not easy with my mail <br>
system to concatenate messages together.  It would be difficult<br>
for people to keep track of who sent what in a digest with nine messages<br>
about nine different topics, and force people who might not be interested<br>
in a particular topic to read everything to see what they want.<br>
<p>
I also point out for those who want a digest that it is possible for me <br>
to mail out the monthly archive to anyone who doesn't want to receive <br>
daily messages.  And if you would really like a digest, send me feedback<br>
and tell me so.<br>

I was interested to read the account of the confrontation in the Pittsburgh<br>
church, which seems to have been sparked by the issue of music in worship.<br>
<p>
Having often been involved in organizing, producing and performing music<br>
in my church, I also can vouch for the fact that the music issue is not<br>
a "young Vs old" thing at all, and is not *always* a "liberal Vs conservative"<br>
thing either.<br>
<p>
Recently at Avondale College we had a prominent Australian professional<br>
entertainer, James Morrison, hold a Saturday night concert in the<br>
Auditorium. He is an excellent musician, grew up a Christian, and directed<br>
his performance very much toward the Christian audience present. I was<br>
operating the mixer, not a very taxing job because the quartet wanted<br>
very much an acoustic, "40s"-type sound, and James's brass instruments<br>
hardly required amplification. The program consisted of a mix of gospel<br>
songs and jazz standards, with a vocalist who popped out a couple of times<br>
to sing some hymns. At one stage the audience was most impressed by this<br>
white retired pastor cum jazz musician singing When The Saints, a la Louis<br>
Armstrong.<br>
<p>
Strangely enough, even though I was working, I actually felt at times that<br>
the program had a bit of a spiritual atmosphere. I haven't always felt<br>
like that during College concerts - student "talent" productions are often<br>
such that a prayer at the end almost seems out of place, unfortunately.<br>
<p>
Most people touted this concert as the "concert of the year", with one<br>
notable exception. Someone wrote to the College newsletter, quoting<br>
passages from EGW regarding teachers leading young people astray, and<br>
pointing out the following quote from the church manual.<br>
<p>
     Great care should be exercised in the choice of music. Any melody<br>
     partaking of the nature of jazz, rock, or related hybrid forms, or<br>
     any language expressing foolish or trivial sentiments, will be<br>
     shunned by persons of true culture. Let us use only good music in <br>
     the home, in the social gathering, in the school, and in the church.<br>
         SDA Church Manual, 1990, p146<br>
<p>
Having read this a few times, I can't help feeling that it sounds a bit<br>
like an advertisement for an Apple Macintosh. You know, "Macintosh.<br>
For the power user with true culture." Now I have nothing against Apple,<br>
and I enjoy "serious" music, where I say serious in the sense of serious<br>
versus popular.<br>
<p>
I also agree with what I think this section of the Church manual is<br>
trying to say. Rewrite the middle sentence something like: "The best<br>
music is a meaningful and beautiful expression of human experience, <br>
tempered by the Christian world view.", and I am totally comfortable<br>
with it.<br>
<p>
But let's face it, this argument about the evils of popular music has<br>
been around for centuries. I'm sure I could dig up a quote about the<br>
debased nature of music with a tune, as compared with the Gregorian<br>
chant. And a couple of centuries down the line, another about the<br>
disgraceful harmony now being introduced into the music of the church,<br>
when harmoncame straight from the theatre and the pub. As for<br>
musical instruments in church, well, clearly these were an abomination,<br>
when God gave man vocal cords with which to make song.<br>
<p>
These days the argument has moved along to certain instruments, and<br>
certain styles which now represent the popular music trend. I think<br>
statements such as the one I quoted from the Church Manual only serve<br>
to increase the confusion between "taste", "culture" and "morality".<br>
We need to avoid these "true culture" judgments, otherwise we fall into<br>
the trap of making class distinctions within the church, just like those<br>
in general society.<br>
<p>
If there's nothing we can do to change the Church Manual, then maybe<br>
we should at least refrain from quoting such parts of it!<br>

Fred Kinsey, Communications Director of the Northern California Conference, <br>
has a desire to begin a Seventh-day Adventist Forum on Compuserve. This would <br>
be a place where not only messages could be placed but articles from Union <br>
papers could be downloaded along with software, graphics, or other items of <br>
potential interest.<br>
<p>
If there is a great deal of support for the idea it would help to pursuade <br>
Compuserve it would be worth it. Also Fred could probably use help setting it <br>
up. Any interest can be forwarded to him at Compuserve address 71340,3037.<br>

Dave says, "Seventh-Day-Adventists, in their study of the Bible, find that  <br>
Michael  the Archangel  is  Jesus  the  Commander  in  chief of the heavenly <br>
host and not Himself an angel.  If you can prove from the Bible that Michael  <br>
is  a  mere angel  then  you  have  proved  that  Michael is not Jesus."<br>
<p>
That is not really true. The word "angel" in the original languages simply <br>
means "messenger." Even men and animals are called angels (although not always<br>
translated into English as angel.) Given that meaning, Jesus is the true arch <br>
messenger or archangel.<br>

The LDS Church has a strong high school youth program.  It is called<br>
"Seminary" and the young people meet for religious instruction at 6 in<br>
the morning every school day.  They usually meet in the church building<br>
nearby or even in a home.  Parents of high school students can also choose<br>
"home seminary" where they study on their own and meet once a week with<br>
the seminary as a group.  They have done this for years and it is more or<br>
less expected for young people to attended seminary.  To get into Brigham<br>
Young University now, a young person must have attended seminary all 4<br>
years of high school.  This is used a test of spiritual commitment.  If the<br>
person didn't care about seminary, he/she won't be happy with the religious<br>
requirements at the church's university.<br>
<p>
I sometimes wonder if a program like this could not be done in the SDA church<br>
for young people attending public high school.  In fact, the fact that the<br>
LDS Church as seminary is why the church has never established its own<br>
church school system.  The LDS high school students can talk about things<br>
they're being taught in Science class or health during seminary.  This helps<br>
put a spiritual perspective on the "worldly knowledge".  One of my new LDS<br>
friends here in Wisconsin just moved here from Wichita, Kansas.  She has a<br>
16 year old son who attended a very rough, gang-infested high school in<br>
Wichita.  She said that seminary in the mornings before school was what<br>
made life tolerable for him at the high school.  He received spiritual help<br>
and companionship before the each day which made a real difference.  His<br>
new school in Wisconsin is in a middle-class neighborhood where the biggest<br>
"problem" is scholastic competition.  This year, he is in "home seminary"<br>
which he really enjoys.<br>

Dan Turk asks with regard to the proposal to set up an SDA Forum <br>
on Compuserve, why not do it on Internet where non-compuserve subscribers<br>
can get at it.<br>
<p>
Two reasons:<br>
<p>
1)  We already have such a forum on Internet and this is it.<br>
<p>
2)  Those few people that subscribe to us via compuserve are taking <br>
a per-message charge to receive the Internet-based messages of SDAnet,<br>
as far as I understand.  (Correct me if I'm wrong.)  A compuserve<br>
based forum would make it accessible to more people and also to<br>
people that didn't subscribe, since Compuserve forums are open for everyone<br>
to read (as far as I know.)<br>

I don't mind seeing a forum on Compuserve, but just would want to have<br>
the same dialog available (without charge) to those of us on the<br>
Internet.  That was the only reason for my comment.  I don't subscribe<br>
to Compuserve, and would thus hope I could access any such forum through<br>
the Internet.....!<br>

<i>&gt; I'm not having a go at anyone here, because I certainly believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; that aspect is important. However my personal concerns with home</i><br>
<i>&gt; schooling are more in the area of socialization.</i><br>
<p>
Our younger son is home schooling 8th grade.  We have two church<br>
schools about equal distance from us.  One school has a somewhat<br>
active home school support program where, for a very reasonable fee,<br>
home schoolers can participate in a wide variety of school activities,<br>
such as field trips to the zoo, science fair, etc.  We made similar<br>
arrangements with the other school so that he can show up for recess any<br>
time he likes, etc.  He is also playing bass clarinet in the academy band.<br>
So, his social life is rather full.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
Just to clarify, I was meaning  "socialization", not "socializing". <br>
Socialization is one of those words I discovered during my education <br>
course, and some of the aspects it addresses have to do with the<br>
integration of a person into society and so on. A person can be<br>
socialized into SDA culture, for example, or into any other type<br>
of society/culture with norms, mores and expectations. (You psychologists<br>
out there - help me out!)<br>
<p>
When I was being home schooled I too was allowed to turn up at school for<br>
recess, and still associated with my friends. However I can still remember<br>
feeling that I didn't really qualify to be part of the group, and often<br>
felt quite out of place. For a ten year old, this can be quite devastating,<br>
even though he or she may not admit it to anyone else.<br>
<p>
I know that just attending school doesn't mean that you are going to feel<br>
part of the group. I had to deal with that too as a child. But that's <br>
different to feeling that you don't even qualify.<br>
<p>
It would be interesting to do some kind of longtitudinal study on this<br>
topic, because I personally suspect that anybody who was homeschooled<br>
for long periods of time, particularly during those years where peer-group<br>
issues are so significant, is going to carry that feeling of being an<br>
"outsider" for quite some time to come.<br>

<i>&gt;Here at University of Wisconsin, we have an interesting situation.  State</i><br>
<i>&gt;law prohibits the existance of student associations which are political in</i><br>
<i>&gt;nature but religious associations are totally acceptable.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What is the situation at your state university?</i><br>
<p>
At the University of Newcastle, Australia, any association, including religious<br>
and political associations, may form unless an association with identical aims<br>
already exists. An association must have 25 members to exist. They must not<br>
disallow any person from joining, or from attending functions, but members may<br>
be expelled under extreme circumstances (not much short of illegal actions). <br>
The Student Union then provides a small amount of funding each year for <br>
administrative purposes ($50) and an equal sum for 6 official gatherings of<br>
the association in that year. This sum is doubled if the group has 50 members<br>
rather than 25. The Union also covers up to $100 in losses for some functions.<br>
<p>
We have a group called NASA (Newcastle Adventist Students Association) which<br>
essentially <br>
	* plans periodic Friday night and Saturday programs for Uni students<br>
	to get together and socialize and listen to various speakers or <br>
	discuss a range of topics<br>
	* conducts occasional church programs for various churches in the <br>
	disctrict<br>
	* and plans "recovery" weekend outings after exams each semester.<br>
It also liases with similar groups at Universities around the rest of Australia<br>
for larger functions.<br>

Steve, (and net) I would be in favor of a SDA net on CompuServe because<br>
simply, it costs us more to send and receive messages to and from<br>
Internet. It is not uncommon for me to have a monthly bill of $100-$125.<br>

Having written this, I can see that it has turned in to a long article.<br>
Hopefully, you will have time to read it because I believe there is a<br>
lot in it that is worth reading/discussing, even if I cannot be very<br>
active (due to Ph.D. commitments).  I'm sorry that I haven't had time<br>
to rewrite it which may have lead to a better format.<br>
<p>
    If you don't notice as you read through, there are a lot of<br>
personal opinions in this post.  I reserve the right to be totally<br>
human, which includes but is not limited to being cynical, being wrong, <br>
being right, being somewhere in between wrong and right, being uninformed,<br>
and not knowing everything :-)<br>
<p>
The incident which is related to the quote appearing above occurred<br>
at the North New South Wales Conference Camp at Stuart's Point a couple of <br>
weeks ago.  I am writing an account based on my eye-witness experience, and <br>
my conversations with various people involved.  Any errors or misleading <br>
statements are mine (and unintentional!)<br>
<p>
    In the Youth tent on Sabbath afternoon, there was a program which was <br>
basically a presentation of various activities of the youth around the <br>
Conference which have a charitable and/or evangelical flavour.  There were<br>
things such as:<br>
  *  The "Bike For Bibles" group cycling 1000km to raise money for<br>
     the Bible Society (?). <br>
  *  Interviews with past Student Missionaries and a live phone conversation <br>
     with one in the Middle East.<br>
  *  The story of a church youth group who organised a community touch-football      competition which raised community consciousness of Adventism (and <br>
     dispelled a few myths about those 'wierd' Adventists).<br>
  *  Interviews with the small team who travelled to Barcelona just<br>
     before the Olympics to street witness (via drama/mime/clowning and<br>
     other non-orthodox methods) - they left before the Olympics to<br>
     visit other countries, including at least one Muslim country where<br>
     any offence to Mohammed is a serious crime, but found many people<br>
     were interested and moved by their work, and they were not charged<br>
     with any crime!  Language was not as big a barrier as it could have<br>
     been for performances which were simply mime.<br>
  *  A presentation by the "Bus Team" - one church group on its own has<br>
     purchased and renovated a London Bus as a drop-in centre/coffee<br>
     shop type of place, and it has "Megalife" emblazoned on the side.<br>
     It's known as "The Big Red Bus" and a small team of Conference-sponsored <br>
     volunteers now travels around the conference helping local youth to run <br>
     programs, running Scripture programs in state schools, and operating the <br>
     bus as a drop in centre for any one on the streets at night times.  As you<br>
     may imagine, this is leading edge evangelism, dealing with people<br>
     where they are (usually straight off the street) and whatever state they <br>
     are in.  They have had many amazing experiences (and people have had life <br>
     changing experiences, including street kids, prostitutes, alcoholics, <br>
     drug addicts and even one guy who came onto the bus and admitted to <br>
     being a murderer.)  <br>
<p>
To conclude the program, a group of 5 guys came on to sing a couple of<br>
songs as an item.  I happen to know all of them reasonably well (and one<br>
is my flatmate!)  They are not professional singers, and they know it,<br>
but they were there intending to praise God.  Their first song was reasonably<br>
good for amateurs in my opinion (and I believe I have had enough<br>
experience with music/performances/bands to be more discerning than the<br>
average person - conversations with the average Youth Tent attendee<br>
about the music tend to confirm this.)  Their style was somewhat jazzy, <br>
and they were moving on stage in a fashion which was fairly natural <br>
considering the effort and soul they were putting into their<br>
performance.  Adventists have a strong history of vocal groups (e.g. The<br>
Heritage Singers, Reunion, The Jackson Family, Endless Praise (from<br>
Australia)) so what they were doing was nothing new to most SDA's.  <br>
    They then proceeded to start "Amazing Grace" in a similar<br>
fashion, with not quite the same technical mastery, and requesting that<br>
the audience join them in praising God.  However, Some people in the audience <br>
had begun to feel that the performance had a comical air, and began to laugh <br>
or snigger.  <br>
    Right at the start of the song (from my memory), a man (in his late <br>
30's/early 40's ?) got up from his seat and wandered down to the front, ending <br>
up next to one of the performers right at the end of the first verse.  He <br>
asked for the microphone and was given it.  He said words to the effect that <br>
after the program we had seen about the work being done in the name of God, he<br>
felt that it was inappropriate for us to be "mocking God", at which<br>
point he returned to his seat.<br>
<p>
    For those who want to know what happened, they continued singing in<br>
a more subdued fashion, but the audience did not feel inclined to join<br>
in as they were again asked to.  I personally felt emotions ranging from <br>
embarassed (both for the performers and myself) to horrified.  Afterwards, <br>
there was serious discussion between various people involved in the incident <br>
and other interested parties.<br>
<p>
    During those conversations, this man (or someone arguing for his<br>
"side" apparently quoted the exact same words from the Church Manual<br>
that appear near the beginning of this article.  The group was told that<br>
they should have prayed about what they were going to do beforehand.<br>
When they replied that they had spent time in serious prayer and that<br>
they believed that they were praising God and that God was with them,<br>
they were told that when they prayed, they should have also listened,<br>
and that if they felt that God was with them they obviously hadn't<br>
prayed hard enough.  <br>
    There were perhaps other concerns involved - this man appeared to be <br>
trying to link this incident to the work of the Bus Team (which was <br>
presented prior to the item) and claim that it would damage the ministry <br>
and credibility of the Bus Team - and later said that he had been following <br>
the Bus Team around the Conference keeping an eye on them, and now he had <br>
the evidence he needed.  He also said things like "right is right, and <br>
wrong is wrong", and that what they had done was entertainment and <br>
therefore wrong.<br>
<p>
My personal observations are:<br>
    *  if the performers had been black (like the Jackson family perhaps, <br>
       or the award winning group of Adventists, "Take 6") then the mannerisms <br>
       and even style of music would have seemed perfectly natural.  Their<br>
       movement on stage was not perceived as any form of dance (which<br>
       we all know we can't have) but was consistent with (black?) singers<br>
       putting their heart and soul into their song.<br>
           I do not know what the reaction would have been if noone<br>
       saw the item as humourous.  In the Youth Tent, at any given time,<br>
       there is almost certainly at least one person who finds humour in<br>
       the program, given the age group and maturity of those present.<br>
    *  While techincally was far from the best item I heard during the<br>
       Camp, it was also far from the worst.<br>
    *  I know these guys and they were seriously intending to praise God.  <br>
       (It was suggested to the man involved that this was either an argument <br>
       about musical standards - which are not black/white, OR he was calling <br>
       the performers liars in that they had the intention of mocking God.  <br>
       He was unable to accept either position nor suggest an alternative.)  <br>
    *  It would have been better that the item be performed at a<br>
       different time, as the program was reasonably "Traditional<br>
       Adventist" except that the activities described were often very<br>
       unorthodox!  It was also Sabbath (though not during "Sabbath School"<br>
       time nor "Church".<br>
    *  Though I appreciate that this man must have felt _very_ strongly about <br>
       the item to do as he did, from talking to various youth I felt that far <br>
       more harm than good had been caused - various people (including but not <br>
       limited to performers in the item) felt that their spiritual experience <br>
       and their expression of that experience had been rejected, and this was <br>
       profoundly disturbing.  <br>
    *  More trivially, anyone who linked the item with the Bus Team must have <br>
       either difficulty in appreciating that the presenter announces each new         segment of the programme, or thought that the Bus Team was linked with <br>
       the Olympics witnessing team, which was linked with the touch football  <br>
       competition, which was linked ...<br>
    *  The man stated his reasons and opinions in a calm and rational<br>
       manner.  There were no histrionics or arm waving - it was perceived<br>
       to be well handled given the strength of feeling that he must have <br>
       had about the item.<br>
<p>
<p>
    Now, take your music as you like it and appreciate what you will,<br>
but this incident raises a small host of questions.<br>
<p>
    * Firstly, this guy had apparently asked the sound mixer to turn<br>
      them off before he made his stage appearance.  Can we please stop<br>
      pressuring the sound man about the content of the program?!<br>
      (Tony, do you want to comment?)  I was the sound man for 3 years for<br>
      a contemporary band of Christian musicians, and copped a lot of flak<br>
      from various directions, so I know a little of what it is like.<br>
      The sound man is not there to make musical judgements - he's<br>
      there to do the sound in the way that the performers/program producers<br>
      want it done.  Get off his back.  (It is rumoured that the man<br>
      threatened to pull the plug, as happened to another performance<br>
      in Sydney a year/two ago when the person responsible for the <br>
      programme felt unable to support what was going on.  Pulling the<br>
      plug can have nasty effects on sound gear sometimes, and it's _very_<br>
      expensive gear.)<br>
<p>
    * Secondly, is "performance" wrong?  Or, is "performance = entertainment"?<br>
      I wondered if this man had been in the Youth Tent during "Church"<br>
      when a performer named "Francene" who used to be a night-life type<br>
      entertainer in Paris before she became a Christian, sang "Amazing <br>
      Grace", solo - she has an amazing voice and puts it to awesome use<br>
      for God, but her singing is even more a performance than that of<br>
      the guys above.  One could certainly view it as entertainment if<br>
      one had that desire.  Does this make it wrong?  <br>
<p>
    * How do we deal with the "it's all black and white" attitude, which<br>
      usually goes hand in hand with "I can prove it to you by quoting <br>
      selected excerpts from EGW/The Bible/The Church Manual".  <br>
          Firstly,if you disagree with me that this is a problem - fine.<br>
      I'm happy to hear your viewpoint.  However, I have seen so much of<br>
      this attitude during my growing up in the Church, and so many<br>
      situations where the attitude is:<br>
          (a) arguably very wrong and utterly simplistic<br>
          (b) regardless of right/wrong-ness, causes great harm to the <br>
              interests of God, the Church, and people around the<br>
              Church.<br>
      I see many (particularly young) people completely turned off anything to <br>
      do with God/religion, and the cause is often directly traceable to this <br>
      attitude.  As one of my friends said to me recently, "Can you think<br>
      of anyone from your final year at school who still goes to church?"<br>
      The common experience is often that it is hard to recall such people.<br>
          As one pastor related to me, he once had some members of the<br>
      Church Board come to him, complaining that an elder's wife was wearing<br>
      jewellery, and asking him if he was going to do something about it.<br>
      "Sure," he said.  "When?" he was asked.  "Well," he said, "I have<br>
      a list of priorities.  First, there are about 5 billion people who<br>
      have never heard of Jesus Christ.  Secondly, there are thousands<br>
      upon thousands of street kids, people with alcohol problems,<br>
      people going hungry, victims of violence and oppression etc.<br>
      After I deal with those two, I'm going to worry about jewellery."<br>
<p>
      I wonder if the black/white attitude comes from education of a <br>
      particular type where the attitudes and conclusions of the parents<br>
      are passed on without the reasoning behind them, or if it results<br>
      from a lack of education which makes it desirable to see the world<br>
      in black and white terms - a user's manual, if you like:  for<br>
      those in situation 173(b), rules 13 and 132(f) mean that you will<br>
      do action x.  Life is so utterly secure, because you _know_ that<br>
          (a) you are always right.<br>
          (b) your course of action is always mapped out for you.<br>
          (c) you never have to change your mind.<br>
          (d) you have no opinions - you simply _know_.<br>
          (e) you don't even need rules 13 and 132(f), because you know<br>
              you have to do action x.<br>
          (f) you can leave your brain asleep in bed when you get up.<br>
              (My opinion only.)<br>
      I'm sorry if I seem cynical about this - to quite an extent I am,<br>
      and so are _lots_ of young people that know.<br>
<p>
      I have to admit that there are people who see the world in much<br>
      more black and white terms than I do, and have thought their position<br>
      through thoroughly.  To such people I say, I respect your opinions<br>
      because you have thought them through for yourself, but you must <br>
      allow me to think my position through and reach a different conclusion.<br>
      Unfortunately, the stereotype that I see is that people with such a<br>
      world view love to attempt to impose their world view on others.<br>
      Those who see the world more in shades of gray _tend_ to be more<br>
      accepting of alternative viewpoints and thus to see no particular <br>
      need to attempt to impose their viewpoints on others.  This can<br>
      look like weakness - if I am not willing to ram my argument down<br>
      your throat just because you are trying to do the same to me, then<br>
      there must be something wrong with my position.<br>
<p>
      This is at least partially related to the next item.<br>
<p>
    * How should we use The Bible/EGW/The Church Manual, especially with<br>
      regard to our own behaviour and with behavioural standards we wish<br>
      to enforce on others?  (Should we attempt to enforce standards on<br>
      others, and if so, how should they be deteremined, who should<br>
      enforce, how should enforcement be conducted etc?)<br>
 <br>
      If I have time (or enough people ask me to ;-) I will attempt to <br>
      write another article containing my recollections of a series of<br>
      3 meetings that Pastor Graham Bradford ran in the Youth Tent, dealing<br>
      with questions of inspiration/function/authority with respect to<br>
      The Bible and EGW, and touching on Truth in a way that seems to me<br>
      to be related to the black/white attitude.  These series of<br>
      meetings gave me hope that Adventism can exhibit common sense and<br>
      sanity at a time when I have often felt a great lack of those two<br>
      commodities.  It is especially confidence inspiring that these words<br>
      are coming from a reasonably high position in the Church heirarchy,<br>
      because in my opinion many people will listen simply because of the <br>
      position of the presenter, and hopefully start thinking on these things.<br>
          There were lots of interesting observations on the life of EGW<br>
      and the way in which she (and her contemporaries) saw the inspiration<br>
      of her writings and the way in which they should be used.  I haven't<br>
      got time to go into details now.  The meetings were being recorded,<br>
      but unfortunately the tape recorder broke during the second session.<br>
      Graham was quite worried that people would take what he had to say<br>
      out of context and use it to say things that he did not say, so I<br>
      don't imagine that they'll be releasing copies of only sessions 1 &amp; 3.<br>
      (It's funny to remember that when my father was an SDA pastor, he used<br>
      to tape record his own sermons for the very same reason.  Is it a<br>
      uniquely SDA phenomenon that we are eager to take things out of<br>
      context and use them as weapons?)<br>
<p>
    * Is this a "youth versus oldies" issue?  Do older generations and<br>
      younger have different views on what is appropriate in expressing<br>
      praise to God?  Do we insist that when separate meetings exist,<br>
      that older people stay out of the Youth Tent?  Or do we refuse to<br>
      tailor programs more towards Youth because of the potential non-Youth <br>
      audience?<br>
<p>
    * How do I personally deal with someone who appears to me to be out to<br>
      damage the Bus Team ministry and youthful expression and experience<br>
      of spirituality?  A particular problem appears to be that he has no<br>
      way to allow anyone else to disagree with him and entertain the <br>
      possibility that they are correct, or even that the truth is not<br>
      totally captured by either of us.<br>
          To the best of my perception, the Bus Team is performing a great<br>
      and mighty and even necessary ministry on behalf of a Church which<br>
      would like to call itself "The Caring Church".  In addition, people<br>
      must be able to express their spirituality in all the different ways<br>
      that (I believe) God has given without being rejected for their style<br>
      or sincerity of expression.<br>
          In short, I profoundly disagree with this man.  Yet to some extent<br>
      the way that I believe allows me to accept his different beliefs, but<br>
      his belief system does not appear to allow him to accept mine.  How <br>
      do we deal with this tension, which some have characterised as between<br>
      "young and old" or "liberal and conservative" or "immature and mature"?<br>
      The generalisations probably obscure the issue.<br>
          <br>
By the way, one of the most profound experiences of my life was the<br>
first time I heard live jazz, with James Morisson in a little room at<br>
Uni set up as a small jazz club.  I couldn't stop grinning broadly for three<br>
days!  Personally, I'm looking forward to playing jazz (or something<br>
even better!) when I get to heaven.<br>

To Dan Turk &amp; Net:<br>
<p>
Dan, I understand what you are saying about Internet VS CompuServe. Since<br>
I have belonged to CS since 1983 and use it regularly I would prefer a net<br>
on CS.<br>
<p>
I could be wrong but what I have understood from what some of the members<br>
have said, that internet is available to those who are working for<br>
industry or at an educational institution. My ? is for the SDAs that are<br>
in such a situation, is Internet free???<br>
<p>
ON CS I have flat membership which is $7.95 per month no matter how much<br>
you use it. The fly in the ointment for me is that I do not have a local<br>
number for CS but do use CS's 800 number which costs .15 a minute any<br>
time. In addition to that charge I pay .15 per message to receive and /or<br>
send messages through internet. CS does give us a $9.00 credit each month<br>
for messages through internet so that is a help.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;I think it is more important to ask "what does the doctrine of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;trinity have to say" than to make statements about whether God is</i><br>
(2)<br>
<i>&gt;"really" made up of three distinct components. One important thing</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the doctrine says, for example, is that Jesus is God.</i><br>
(3)<br>
<i>&gt;We're setting ourselves up for a certain amount of embarrassment on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the day that we see these things for ourselves if we try to make too</i><br>
<i>&gt;much of it at this stage.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Tony</i><br>
<p>
Tony, this was very well said, I especially appreciate the intent to find<br>
out what God is trying to tell us about Himself without actually expecting<br>
to understand Him as you would something under a microscope (he's too awe-<br>
some for any microscope!!!)  However, it should be noted that the trinity<br>
doctrine does not say that Jesus is God, it says that Jesus is 1/3 God.<br>
<p>
Don't misunderstands me, I believe in the Father, the Son, and the Holy<br>
Ghost, but I don't like to use the wording of the trinity doctrine, or<br>
even the word trinity itself, here's why.<br>
<p>
A few people I study with, from work, think that Jesus didn't really die.<br>
"After all," they say, "since He was 1/3rd of the Trinity, and God cannot<br>
die, then 1/3rd of God could not have died, so Jesus didn't really die on<br>
the cross, just His body, and His soul went back to heaven until the<br>
resurrection."<br>
<p>
In an attempt to explain the state of the dead, I had to ask them to agree<br>
to use the Bible definitions for Body, Soul, Spirit, Life, Death, etc.  So<br>
they agreed and we started with Genesis.  But even after convincing them<br>
of what the Bible teaches concerning the state of the dead, they still<br>
would not accept that Jesus really had died.  This led me to examine the<br>
doctrine of God, the God-Head, the Trinity, etc.  Anyway, to make a long<br>
story a little longer &lt;smile&gt; I found more mystery than answers.  I kept<br>
trying to define God using my own terms and definitions which would run<br>
me into some obstacle, forcing me to go back to the Bible.  Thus, I've<br>
become very sensitive to the word Trinity since it's not even used in the<br>
Bible.  (nor in any of EGW's writings, for that matter)<br>
<p>
I've ran into some who don't even believe in the Trinity, and others who<br>
claim that there is no Holy Spirit, and others still who claim that Jesus<br>
was created; but I hold to none of these.  I only know that He has told<br>
us that "Faith cometh by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God."  This<br>
is the promise I'm holding on to, and I know He has provided all knowledge<br>
that I need for Salvation in His Word and will provide all Understanding<br>
of His Word through His Spirit.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;Our personal experience with home schooling is that it is the best</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;option available for those who have that option.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One of the reasons why I questioned home-schooling in the first place was</i><br>
<i>&gt; because of an experience I had while practice teaching a few years ago.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know how she was going in </i><br>
<i>&gt; English or History but I know how she was going in Mathematics and Science:</i><br>
<i>&gt; she had no knowledge of these subjects at a high school level at all.</i><br>
<p>
Alas, the same thing could be said of far too many public school students<br>
(at least here in the US) and perhaps also of some private school kids.<br>
My observation is that one will find variation of thoroughness and preparation<br>
among home schooled children just as one will find among traditionally<br>
schooled children.  Statistics cited by Dr Raymond Moore indicate that,<br>
on average, home schooled children outscore schooled children on all<br>
normative (or is it "normalized"?) achievement tests.<br>
<p>
As for socialization (which I find to be a "red herring"):  Dr Moore, Greg<br>
Harris, and others have found published articles in refereed journals<br>
indicating that home schooled children, on average, are markedly better<br>
socialized than their peers.  In such aspects as resistance to peer<br>
pressure, ability to interact in a meaningful manner with individuals<br>
outside their age group, the differences are significant:  home schooled<br>
students stand head and shoulders above.<br>
<p>
Drawing generalizations from observation of extreme examples (alas, it<br>
is not always clear that they are extreme), whether on the positive or<br>
the negative side, informs one little about the average case.  Having said<br>
that 8-), it may be of interest that Harvard has accepted home schooled<br>
students into their accelerated PhD track program (featured in Reader's<br>
Digest some years back).  There's a high school age home schooler doing<br>
materials research with NASA and medical researchers (cited in ATIA<br>
newsletters published by IBLP).<br>
<p>
Factual data is obtainable from the Moore Foundation; I imagine that<br>
ATIA (708-323-9800) would be another source.  Resources such as the Adventist<br>
Home Educator newsletter have both factual and anecdotal info.  I imagine<br>
that publishers such as Rod&amp;Staff, Sonshine Resources, A Beka, Alpha Omega,<br>
Christian Liberty Academy, et al, also have relevant info.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What wisdom have others got to offer on the subject?</i><br>
<p>
The continuing compliments we receive on the graciousness, respectful<br>
attitudes, vivaciousness, and wisdom of our home schooled children is<br>
a source of great joy.  The name of the Lord is to be praised!<br>

<i>&gt; One of the reasons why I questioned home-schooling in the first place was</i><br>
<i>&gt; because of an experience I had while practice teaching a few years ago.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There was a girl in one of my classes who had not gone to school because her</i><br>
<i>&gt; . . . . . .</i><br>
<p>
You do raise a valid concern.  A concerned parent needs to be careful<br>
that the same thing not happen even in a school situation.  In the<br>
news we hear about highschool grads who cannot even read.  But of<br>
course its less likely for a student to be blind in a given area if he/she<br>
has had several teachers over the years.<br>
<p>
In our case, our boys have done very well at math and science.  My wife<br>
was especially concerned about her ability to teach them english.<br>
Because of this concern she made a special effort in this area.  When<br>
the boys were back at church school the following year they were top<br>
of their class over all and especially in math, science and english.<br>
<p>
Many of the problems of home school can be avoided by working with<br>
an established program, and there are several of them out there.  Many<br>
of these programs include testing materials that will show up<br>
deficiencies in any area.  Of course the risks are greatest if parents<br>
want to go strictly on their own.<br>

I heard some of this from Mordecai DuShey, a Messianic SDA (i.e., Jewish SDA),<br>
while he was living in White Salmon, WA.  I found this article to be quite<br>

<p>
	Here is an article I read.  It is very good. It is also long.<br>
<p>
	=============================================================<br>
<p>
                        JEWISHNESS AND THE TRINITY<br>
                                    by<br>
                            Arnold Fruchtenbaum<br>
<p>
                  (Article appeared in ISSUES, Vol. 1:8)<br>
<p>
<p>
     In a recent question-answer article, Rabbi Stanley Greenberg of Temple<br>
Sinai in Philadelphia wrote:<br>
<p>
          "Christians are, of course, entitled to believe in a<br>
          trinitarian conception of god, but their effort to base<br>
          this conception on the Hebrew Bible must fly in the<br>
          face of the overwhelming testimony of that Bible. <br>
          Hebrew Scriptures are clear and unequivocal on the<br>
          oneness of God...The Hebrew Bible affirms the one God<br>
          with unmistakable clarity.  Monotheism, an<br>
          uncompromising belief in one God, is the hallmark of<br>
          the Hebrew Bible, the unwavering affirmation of Judaism<br>
          and the unshakable faith of the Jew."<br>
<p>
     Whether Christians are accused of being polytheists or tri-theists or<br>
whether it is admitted that the Christian concept of the Tri-unity is a<br>
form of monotheism, one element always appears: one cannot believe in the<br>
Trinity and be Jewish.  Even if what Christians believe is monotheistic, it<br>
still does not seem to be monotheistic enough to qualify as true<br>
Jewishness.  Rabbi Greenberg's article tends to reflect that thinking.<br>
<p>
     He went on to say, "...under no circumstances can a concept of a<br>
plurality of the Godhead or a trinity of the Godhead ever be based upon the<br>
Hebrew Bible."  It is perhaps best then to begin with the very source of<br>
Jewish theology and the only means of testing it: Hebrew Scriptures.  Since<br>
so much relies on Hebrew language usage, then to the Hebrew we should turn.<br>
<p>
                           I. God Is A Plurality<br>
<p>
The Name Elohim<br>
<p>
     It is generally agreed that "Elohim" is a plural noun having the<br>
masculine plural ending "im."  The very word Elohim used of the true God in<br>
Genesis 1:1, "In the beginning GOD created the heaven and the earth," is<br>
also used in Exodus 20:3, "Thou shalt have no other gods (Elohim) before<br>
me," and in Deuteronomy 13:3, "...let us go after other gods(Elohim)..."<br>
While the use of the plural Elohim does not prove a Tri-unity, it certainly<br>
opens the door to a doctrine of plurality in the Godhead since it is the<br>
word that is used of the one true God as well as the many false gods.<br>
<p>
Plural Verbs used with Elohim<br>
<p>
     Virtually all Hebrew scholars do recognize that the word Elohim as it<br>
stands by itself is a plural noun.  Nevertheless, they wish to deny that it<br>
allows for any plurality in the Godhead whatsoever.  Their line of<br>
reasoning usually goes like this.  When Elohim is used of the true God, it<br>
is followed by a singular verb; when it is used of false gods, it is<br>
followed by the plural verb.  Rabbi Greenberg states it as follows:<br>
<p>
          "But, in fact, the verb used in the opening verse of<br>
          Genesis is 'bara' which means 'he created' -- singular. <br>
          One need not be too profound a student of Hebrew to<br>
          understand that the opening verse of Genesis clearly<br>
          speaks of a singular God."<br>
<p>
     The points made, of course, are generally true because the Bible does<br>
teach that God is only one God and, therefore, the general pattern is to<br>
have the plural noun followed by the singular verb when it speaks of the<br>
one true God.  However, there are places where the word is used of the true<br>
God and yet it is followed by a plural verb:<br>
<p>
          Genesis 20:13: "And it came to pass, when God (Elohim)<br>
          caused me to wander (Literally: They caused me to<br>
          wander) from my father's house..."<br>
<p>
          Genesis 35:7: "...because there God (Elohim) appeared<br>
          unto him..." (literally: They appeared unto him.)<br>
<p>
          II Samuel 7:23: "...God (Elohim) went..." (Literally:<br>
          They went.)<br>
<p>
          Psalm 58:12: "...There is a God (Elohim) that<br>
          judgeth..." (Literally: They judgeth.)<br>
<p>
The Name Eloah<br>
<p>
     If the plural form of Elohim was the only form available for a<br>
reference to God, then conceivably the argument might be made that the<br>
writers of the Hebrew Scriptures had no other alternative but to use the<br>
word Elohim for both the one true God and the many false gods.  However,<br>
the singular form for Elohim (Eloah) exists and is used in such passages as<br>
Deuteronomy 32:15-17 and Habakkuk 3:3.  This singular form could have<br>
easily been consistently used.  Yet, it is only used 250 times while the<br>
plural form is used 2,500 times.  The far greater use of the plural form<br>
again seems to turn the argument for plurality in the Godhead rather than<br>
against it.<br>
<p>
Plural Pronouns<br>
<p>
     Another case in point regarding Hebrew grammar is that often when God<br>
speaks of Himself, He clearly uses the plural pronoun:<br>
<p>
          Genesis 1:26: "And God (Elohim) said, Let US make man<br>
          in OUR image, after OUR likeness."<br>
<p>
     He could hardly have made reference to angels since man was created in<br>
the image of God and not of angels.  The Midrash Rabbah on Genesis<br>
recognized the strength of the passage and comments as follows:<br>
<p>
          "Rabbi Samuel Bar Hanman in the name of Rabbi Jonathan<br>
          said, that at the time when Moses wrote the Torah,<br>
          writing a portion of it daily, when he came to this<br>
          verse which says, 'And Elohim said, let us make man in<br>
          our image after our likeness,' Moses said, 'Master of<br>
          the universe, why do you give herewith an excuse to the<br>
          sectarians (who believe in the Tri-unity of God).'  God<br>
          answered Moses, 'You write and whoever wants to err,<br>
          let him err.'" [Midrash Rabbah on Genesis 1:26, New<br>
          York; NOP Press, N.D.]<br>
<p>
     It is obvious that the Midrash Rabbah is trying to simply get around<br>
the problem and fails to answer adequately why God refers to Himself in the<br>
plural.<br>
<p>
     The use of the plural pronoun can also be seen in:<br>
<p>
          Genesis 3:22: "And Jehovah God (YHVH Elohim) said,<br>
          Behold, the man is become as one of US..."<br>
<p>
          Genesis 11:7: "Go to, let US go down, and there<br>
          confound their language..."<br>
<p>
          Isaiah 6:8: "Also I heard the voice of the Lord,<br>
          saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for US?"<br>
<p>
     This last passage would appear contradictory with the singular "I" and<br>
the plural "us" except as viewed as a plurality (us) in a unity (I).<br>
<p>
Plural Descriptions of God<br>
<p>
     One point that also comes out of Hebrew is the fact that often God is<br>
described with plural adjectives.  Some examples are:<br>
<p>
          Ecclesiastes 12:1: "Remember now thy creator..." <br>
          (Literally: creators.)<br>
<p>
          Psalm 149:2: "Let Israel rejoice in his maker."<br>
          (Literally: makers.)<br>
<p>
          Joshua 24:19: "...Holy God..." (Literally: holy Gods.)<br>
<p>
          Isaiah 54:5: "For thy maker is thine husband..."<br>
          (Literally: makers, husbands.)<br>
<p>
     Everything we have said so far simply reflects the Hebrew language of<br>
the Scriptures.  If we are to base our theology on the Scriptures alone, we<br>
have to say that on the one hand they affirm God's unity, but at the same<br>
time they tend towards the concept of a compound unity allowing for a<br>
plurality in the Godhead.<br>
<p>
The Shema<br>
<p>
          Deuteronomy 6:4: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is<br>
          one Lord."<br>
<p>
     Deuteronomy 6:4, known as the SHEMA, has always been Israel's great<br>
confession.  It is this verse more than any other that is used to affirm<br>
the fact that God is one and is often used to counteract the concept of<br>
plurality in the Godhead.  But is it a valid use of this verse?<br>
<p>
     On one hand, it should be noted that the very words "our God" are in<br>
the plural in the Hebrew text and literally mean "our Gods."  However, the<br>
main argument lies in the word "one," which is a Hebrew word, echad.  A<br>
glance through the Hebrew text where the word is used elsewhere can quickly<br>
show that the word echad does not mean an absolute "one" but a compound<br>
"one."  For instance, in Genesis 1:5, the combination of evening and<br>
morning comprise one (echad) day.  In Genesis 2:24, a man and a woman come<br>
together in marriage and the two shall become one (echad) flesh.  In Ezra<br>
2:64, we are told that the whole assembly was as one (echad), though of<br>
course, it was composed of numerous people.  A rather striking example is<br>
Ezekiel 37:17 where two sticks are combined to become one (echad).  The use<br>
of the word echad in Scripture shows it to be a compound and not an<br>
absolute unity.<br>
<p>
     There is a Hebrew word that does mean an absolute unity and that is<br>
yachid, which is found in many passages [Genesis 22:2,12; Judges 11:34;<br>
Psalm 22:21; 25:;16; Proverbs 4:3; Jeremiah 6:26; Amos 8:10; Zechariah<br>
12:10.], the emphasis being on the meaning of "only."  If Moses intended to<br>
teach God's absolute oneness as over against a compound unity, this would<br>
have been a far more appropriate word.  In fact, Maimonides noted the<br>
strength of yachid and chose to use that word in his Thirteen Articles of<br>
Faith in place of echad.  However, Deuteronomy 6:4 does not use that word<br>
in reference to God.<br>
<p>
     The Zohar, the great book of Jewish mysticism, recognized the concept<br>
of plurality in the Shema and commented as follows:<br>
<p>
          "Why is there need of mentioning the name of God three<br>
          times in the verse?  The first Jehovah is the Father<br>
          above.  The second is the stem of Jesse, the Messiah<br>
          who is to come from the family of Jesse through David. <br>
          And the third one is the one which is below (meaning<br>
          the Holy Spirit who shows us the way) and these three<br>
          are one." [Quoted by Leopold Cohn, DO CHRISTIANS<br>
          WORSHIP THREE GODS? (New York: Sar Shalom Publications,<br>
          N.D.)]<br>
<p>
                         II.  God Is At Least Two<br>
<p>
Elohim and YHVH Applied to Two Personalities<br>
<p>
     As if to even make the case for plurality stronger, there are<br>
situations in the Hebrew Scriptures where the term Elohim is applied to two<br>
personalities in the same verse.  One example is Psalm 45:7-8:<br>
<p>
          "Thy throne, which is of God, shall stand for ever and<br>
          ever:<br>
          The sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.<br>
          Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness:<br>
          Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil<br>
          of gladness above thy fellows."<br>
<p>
     It should be noted that the first Elohim is being addressed and the<br>
second Elohim is the God of the first Elohim.  And so God's God has<br>
anointed Him with the oil of gladness.<br>
<p>
          "But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and<br>
          will save them by Jehovah their God, and will not save<br>
          them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses nor<br>
          by horsemen."<br>
<p>
     The speaker is Elohim who says He will have mercy on the house of<br>
Judah and will save them by the instrumentality of Jehovah, their Elohim. <br>
So Elohim number one will save Israel by means of Elohim number two.<br>
<p>
     Not only is Elohim applied to two personalities in the same verse, but<br>
so is the very name of God.  One example is Genesis 19:24 which reads:<br>
<p>
          "Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah<br>
          brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven."<br>
<p>
     Clearly we have Jehovah number one raining fire and brimstone from a<br>
second Jehovah who is in heaven, the first one being on earth.<br>
<p>
     A second example is Zechariah 2:12-13:<br>
<p>
          "For thus saith Jehovah of Hosts; for your glory hath<br>
          he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you; for he<br>
          that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. For,<br>
          behold, I will shake my hand upon them, and they shall<br>
          be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that<br>
          Jehovah of hosts hath sent me."<br>
<p>
     Again, we have one Jehovah sending another Jehovah to perform a<br>
specific task.<br>
<p>
     The author of the Zohar sensed plurality in the Tetragrammaton<br>
["Personal Name of God of Israel," written in Hebrew Bible with the four<br>
consonants YHWH. Pronunciation of name has been avoided since at least 3rd<br>
c. B.C.E.; initial substitute was 'Adonai' ('the Lord'), itself later<br>
replaced by 'ha-Shem' ('the Name'). The name Jehovah is a hybrid misreading<br>
of the original Hebrew letters with the vowels of 'Adonai.' ( ENCYCLOPEDIA<br>
DICTIONARY OF JUDAICA, pg. 593.)]  and wrote:<br>
<p>
          "Come and see the mystery of the word YHVH: there are<br>
          three steps, each existing by itself: nevertheless they<br>
          are One, and so united that one cannot be separated<br>
          from the other.  The Ancient Holy One is revealed with<br>
          three heads, which are united into one, and that head<br>
          is three exalted.  The Ancient One is described as<br>
          being three: because the other lights emanating from<br>
          him are included in the three.  But how can three names<br>
          be one?  Are they really one because we call them one? <br>
          How three can be one can only be known through the<br>
          revelation of the Holy Spirit."  [Zohar, Vol. III, pg.<br>
          288, Vol. II, pg. 43.]<br>
<p>
                            III.  God is Three<br>
<p>
How Many Persons are There?<br>
<p>
     If the Hebrew Scriptures truly do point to plurality, the question<br>
arises, how many personalities in the Godhead exist?  We have already seen<br>
the names of God applied to at least two different personalities.  Going<br>
through the Hebrew Scriptures, we find that, in fact, three and only three<br>
distinct personalities are ever considered divine.<br>
<p>
     1. On one hand, there are the myriads of times when there is a<br>
reference to the Lord Jehovah.  This usage is so frequent that there is no<br>
need to devote space to it.<br>
<p>
     2. A second major personality that comes through is the Spirit of God,<br>
often referred to as simply the Ruach Hakodesh.  There are a good number of<br>
references to the Spirit of God among which are Genesis 1:2, Job 26:13,<br>
Psalm 51:13, Psalm 139:7, Isaiah 11:2, etc.  The Holy Spirit cannot be a<br>
mere emanation because He contains all the characteristics of personality<br>
(intellect, emotion and will) and is considered divine.<br>
<p>
     3. A third personality is referred to as the Angel of Jehovah.  This<br>
individual is always considered distinct from all other angels and is<br>
unique.  In almost every passage where He is found He is referred to as<br>
both the Angel of Jehovah and Jehovah Himself.  For instance, in Genesis<br>
16:7 He is referred to as the Angel of Jehovah, but then in 16:13 as<br>
Jehovah Himself.  In Genesis 22:11 He is the Angel of Jehovah, but God<br>
Himself in 22:12.  Other examples could be given. [In Genesis 31 He is the<br>
Angel of God in verse 11, but then He is the God of Bethel in verse 13.  In<br>
Exodus 3 He is the Angel of Jehovah in verse 2 and He is both Jehovah and<br>
God in verse 4. In Judges 6 He is the Angel of Jehovah in verses 11, 12, 20<br>
and 21 but is Jehovah Himself in verses 14, 16, 22, and 23. Then in Judges<br>
13:3 and 21 He is the Angel of Jehovah but becomes God Himself in verse<br>
22.]  A very interesting passage is Exodus 23:20-23 where this angel has<br>
the power to pardon sin because God's own name YHVH is in Him, and,<br>
therefore, He is to be obeyed without question.  This can hardly be said of<br>
any ordinary angel.  But the very fact that God's own name is in this angel<br>
shows His divine status.<br>
<p>
     So then, from various sections of the Hebrew Scriptures there is a<br>
clear showing that three personalities are referred to as divine and as<br>
being God: the  Lord Jehovah, the Angel of Jehovah and the Spirit of God.<br>
<p>
The Three Personalities in the Same Passage<br>
-------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
     Nor have the Hebrew Scriptures neglected to put all three<br>
personalities of the God head together in one passage.  Two examples are<br>
Isaiah 48:12-16 and 63:7-14.<br>
<p>
     Because of the significance of the first passage, it will be quoted:<br>
<p>
          "Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am<br>
          he; I am the first, I also am the last.  Mine hand also<br>
          hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right<br>
          hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them,<br>
          they stand up together.  All ye, assemble yourselves,<br>
          and hear; which among them hath declared these things? <br>
          Jehovah hath loved him: He will do his pleasure on<br>
          Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.  I,<br>
          even I, have spoken: yea, I have called him: I have<br>
          brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous. <br>
          Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken<br>
          in secret from the beginning; from the time that it<br>
          was, there am I: and now the Lord Jehovah and his<br>
          spirit hath sent me."<br>
<p>
     It should be noted that the speaker refers to himself as the one who<br>
is responsible for the creation of the heavens and the earth.  It is clear<br>
that he cannot be speaking of anyone other than God.  But then in verse 16,<br>
the speaker refers to himself using the pronouns of I and me and then<br>
distinguishes himself from two other personalities.  He distinguishes<br>
himself from the LORD JEHOVAH and then from the SPIRIT OF GOD. Here is the<br>
Tri-unity as clearly defined as the Hebrew Scriptures have ever chosen to<br>
make it.<br>
<p>
     In the second passage, there is a reflection back to the time of the<br>
Exodus where all three personalities were present and active.  The Lord<br>
Jehovah is referred to in verse 7, the Angel of Jehovah in verse 9 and the<br>
Spirit of God in verses 10, 11, and 14.  While Himself as being the one<br>
solely responsible for Israel's redemption from Egypt, in this passage<br>
three personalities are given credit for it.  Yet, no contradiction is seen<br>
since all three comprise the unity of the one Godhead.<br>
<p>
Conclusion<br>
----------<br>
<p>
     The teaching of the Old Testament then is that there is a plurality of<br>
the Godhead.  The first person is consistently called Jehovah while the<br>
second person is given the names of Jehovah, the Angel of Jehovah and the<br>
Servant of Jehovah.  Consistently and without fail, the second person is<br>
sent by the first person.  The third person is referred to as the Spirit of<br>
Jehovah or the Spirit of God or the Holy Spirit.  He, too, is sent by the<br>
first person but is continually related to the ministry of the second<br>
person.<br>
<p>
     If the concept of the Tri-unity in the God head is not Jewish<br>
according to modern rabbis, then neither are the Hebrew Scriptures.  Hebrew<br>
Christians cannot be accused of having slipped into paganism when they hold<br>
to the fact that Jesus is a member of the Triune God.  He is the same one<br>
of whom Moses wrote when he said:<br>
<p>
          "Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee in<br>
          the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have<br>
          prepared.  Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke<br>
          him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions:<br>
          for my name is in him.  But if thou shalt indeed obey<br>
          his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an<br>
          enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine<br>
          adversaries.  For mine angel shall go before thee, and<br>
          bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and<br>
          the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the<br>
          Jebusite; and I will cut them off."<br>
                                             --Exodus 23:20-23<br>
<p>
New Testament Light<br>
-------------------<br>
<p>
     In keeping with the teachings of the Old Testament, the New Testament<br>
clearly recognizes that there are three persons in the Godhead, although it<br>
becomes quite a bit more specific.  The first person is called God the<br>
Father while the second person is called God the Son.  The New Testament<br>
answers the question of Proverbs 30:4: "What is his son's name?"  His son's<br>
name is Jesus.  In accordance with the Old Testament, he is sent by God to<br>
be the Messiah, but this time as a man instead of as an angel.  Further-<br>
more, He is sent for a specific purpose: to die for our sins.  In essence,<br>
what happened is that God became a man (not man became God) in order to<br>
accomplish the work of atonement.<br>
<p>
     The New Testament calls the third person, God the Holy Spirit. <br>
Throughout the New Testament He is related to the work of the second person<br>
in keeping with the teaching of the Old Testament.  We see then, that there<br>
is a continuous body of teaching in both the Old and New Testaments<br>
relating to the Tri-unity of God.<br>

Dear Tony,<br>
<p>
like the way you introduced yourself. I have just begun to read all the<br>
accumalating mail messages. I am studying at McGill university in Canada<br>
and am interested in visiting Australia. What's it like in NSW. Thinking of<br>
a stint at Sydney Adventist Hospital.<br>
<p>
Enjoy travelling, so why not Australia, maybe I should consider New Zealand<br>
instead.<br>
<p>
Hope to hear from you soon<br>
<p>
Vijay<br>
<p>
<p>
By the way forgot to introduce myself. My name is Vijay Balasingam.<br>

I was surprised when Paul said it was costing 15 US cents per message <br>
for  getting SDAnet plus his phone time.  I had no idea the cost to <br>
Compuserve readers was so high per message.  In light of that, I am prepared<br>
to make a weekly digest of the traffic to send to Compuserve readers<br>
and others that are interested.  I would like to hear from all the compuserve<br>
subscribers we have (5-10) to see if they would use such a service, and <br>
I will make the service available if enough of them wanted it.<br>
<p>
What about America Online?  What's the charge for their subscribers<br>
per message received from the Internet?<br>
<p>
In answer to Paul's question, the Internet is not really free to anyone.<br>
It's just that some educational institutions absorb the cost of maintaining<br>
the high-speed network connections and don't pass it on to their students<br>
or employees.  Other places, such as Fermilab, absorb the cost but then<br>
stipulate it must be used only for official business.  <br>

<p>
Why not treat Compuserve as a gateway and have it both ways?  That is,<br>
have a single Compuserve internet address on the SDAnet mailing list<br>
and then redistribute internally.  Ditto for outgoing mail.<br>
<p>
You Compuserve wizards will have to pass judgement on whether this is<br>
doable.<br>

Did anybody read the article in one of the August issue of World News<br>
Daily(?) a<br>
   bout a sound recording of angels singing from the Black Hole?  Could anybody<br>
   go to the library to get a copy.  Can't get it in Hong Kong.  Thanks.<br>
     As<br>
   aAnn<br>
<p>
<p>
[This may be a very interesting perversion of a rumor.  I don't know of <br>
such a publication as the World News Daily.  Closest thing in the US<br>
is the Weekly World News (which is actually biweekly.)  That newspaper<br>
is the trashiest of the trash tabloids and it's questionable whether they<br>
have printed anything that is true since they began their existence.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, this is probably a perversion of a story originally printed<br>
in a Finnish tabloid of similar dubious origin, which claimed that<br>
Russian scientists had drilled down deep into the earth and discovered Hell.<br>
It was quite widely spread about the net by people in the US who didn't know<br>
the reputability of the source.  If it has now translated into angels singing<br>
I would be very surprised, and on the other hand not surprised.<br>
<p>
If on the other hand there is such a newspaper and the rumor is totally <br>
different, let us know.  SCT]<br>

I suspect the success/failure of home schooling depends a great deal on<br>
the temperment and personalities of the children and the instructing<br>
parent.  I have a friend in Loma Linda who claims to be home schooling<br>
her 6th grader.  He was kicked out of the SDA elementary school due to<br>
severe behavior problems and rather than send him to public school, she<br>
decided to "home school" him.  Unfortunately, she does not even have a<br>
high school diploma herself.  She works full-time at a department store<br>
and leaves this young lad home by himself to complete his lessons.  As<br>
you may suspect, this was a miserable failure and he is now more than<br>
a year behind scholastically.<br>
<p>
The underlying question of whether to home school should be why?  What<br>
is motivating this choice?  Are the parents truly committed to the<br>
concept or are they trying to avoid high SDA tuition?  I think the<br>
education and talents of the mother (because it is almost always the<br>
mother who teaches home schooled kids) should play a big part of the<br>
decision.  Not all adults have the knack or talent to teach children.<br>
It is not wise to place this burden on a mother who is not prepared for<br>
it.<br>
<p>
I saw a 60 Minutes special a while back about home schooling and the<br>
successes of families choosing this method of education.  It was<br>
impressive.  However, all the kids were very bright and with very bright<br>
parents.  I suspect that bright kids with average parents or bright<br>
parents with only average kids would have problems.<br>
<p>
Two socialization problems I forsee is: (1) lack of experience with<br>
people of other races, cultures, or mores and (2) public speaking.  If<br>
a child never has to present idea to a group of peers, never has to<br>
raise his/her hand to participate in a discussion, he/she will not learn<br>
proper social courtesies.  Home schooled kids typically interact with<br>
adults very well but have a difficult time with kids their own age.  They<br>
may have a wealth of knowledge and feel compelled to tell all they know<br>
when faced with a group situation.  At home, they're rewarded for this<br>
behavior but in the real world, nobody likes a "know-it-all".  I remember<br>
at situation with my cousin's boy when he was just five years old.  In<br>
Sabbath School, the teacher was explaining that a "group of lions" were<br>
resting in the shade.  He pipes up that she should have said a "pride of<br>
lions".  Cute for a 5 year old but obnoxious for a 10 year old.  The<br>
lack of experience with people of other races, cultures, or mores is more<br>
difficult.  Children learn about these from experience.  How can a parent<br>
teach a child racial tolerance, social-class tolerance, or religious<br>
tolerance.  I remember attending SDA elementary school and seeing a black<br>
child for the first time.  I remember when a girl from Japan enrolled in<br>
our school.  I remember when some nonSDAs enrolled (uncommon 30 years ago).<br>
All of these experiences helped shape my attitudes about race, culture,<br>
and religion.  I didn't just learn about them.  I experienced them.  I<br>
remember feeling very bad when all the white boys called the black child<br>
by a derogatory name.  I remember sticking up for her and becoming her<br>
friend.  I remember trading stuff in my lunch with the Japanese girl.<br>
And I remember how nice the nonSDA kids could be.  It was revealing to<br>
me.  I learned that some SDAs are not very nice and that some nonSDAs<br>
were.  Where will the home schooled kids experience this?  Where will<br>
they learn what bigotry is and how to respond to it?  Where will they<br>
learn tolerance to differences?<br>

A couple of weeks ago, Ian posted summaries of the two articles<br>
listed below.  I shared those summaries with a friend who has spent<br>
a considerable time studying I John and is now teaching a class on<br>
it.  He has become very interested in reading the original articles.<br>
Can anyone help me acquire them?  We live near Sacramento, California.<br>
Is there a local archive?  I would be happy to reimburse someone at<br>
Andrews for copying and mailing charges.<br>
<p>
Thank you,<br>

7Excerpts from mail: 19-Oct-92 Re: SDA Forum on Compuserve by McCluskey<br>
G@usl.com <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;Why not treat Compuserve as a gateway and have it both ways?  That is,</i><br>
<i>&gt;have a single Compuserve internet address on the SDAnet mailing list</i><br>
<i>&gt;and then redistribute internally.  Ditto for outgoing mail.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;You Compuserve wizards will have to pass judgement on whether this is</i><br>
<i>&gt;doable.</i><br>
<p>
If what Paul Gates has told us (15 cents a message in and out of <br>
Compuserve to internet) is true, this would put an incredible burden<br>
on someone's compuserve account, not to mention probably running them <br>
out of disk space in short order.  Also, such a process might be many<br>
things, but certainly not a moderated SDAnet, because messages could <br>
bounce within compuserve before moderation.<br>
<p>
We currently have two-way communication with Compuserve with all <br>
Compuserve members communicating directly with me.  Again, I ask<br>
every Compuserve subscriber of ours to E-mail me directly and tell me <br>
if a digest would be a help in handling the charges, and clear up<br>
the conflicting information we have got so far on how much it is costing <br>
you all.<br>
<p>
If a forum within Compuserve begins, I think it would be a good idea<br>
to make the echo of that group available to Internet subscribers, but<br>
it would take someone with a compuserve account willing to make the <br>
financial sacrifice to make it happen.  Of course we would offer our<br>
echo to them.  It would probably also lead me to work quickly on <br>
establishing my own subscription to CompuServe.<br>

Steve -<br>
<p>
The cost on America On Line for any message to/from the internet is ZERO. <br>
This was quite a nice surprise to me.<br>
<p>
I have found out that the only way to send a message is to go to the Internet<br>
Gateway and compose your mail to the Internet there.  That is such a small<br>
price to pay though...   :-D<br>
<p>
I am copying this to a couple of individuals on the AOL network.  Hopefully,<br>
they will see this and join SDANET...<br>
<p>
Yours truly, <br>

I have just learned that SDAnet messages can now be sent to user id's on <br>
Genie.  I don't know what they have to do to reach me as yet, but <br>
given a Genie userid, I can send it to <br>
<p>
userid@genie.geis.com<br>
<p>
So be sure to tell all your friends on Genie to subscribe.<br>

     Several months ago Nancy Vyhmeister requested information on witnessing<br>
experiences university students and professionals have had in a non-SDA<br>
environment. I consider it to be an important topic and have felt that the<br>
Geoscience Research Institute should get more involved along that direction.<br>
At her suggestion, I am giving my response to her to the network.<br>
     In the June issue of the Adventist Association of Physicists newsletter<br>
I included a questionnaire asking for suggestions (among other things) on<br>
making the Gospel credible and acceptable to non-Adventists, particularly<br>
scientists. Jon Paulien at Andrews has suggested several concepts that are<br>
useful:<br>
          personal relationships (creative listening)<br>
          cosmic relationships (great controversy model)<br>
          creation (we are caretakers, not owners)<br>
          the Incarnation (God's concern for each person)<br>
          a Saviour (release from failure at one's own standards)<br>
          hope (Biblical eschatology / a resurrection)<br>
          SDA uniqueness (rejecting established religion)<br>
          purpose/commitment (demands of SDA life style).<br>
Those responding to the questionnaire have felt the most important of these<br>
are (1) a personal relationship and (2) the Incarnation.   I agree.<br>
     The general approach that has worked best for me is this: Get personally<br>
involved with people in the scientific community. Don't obnoxiously emphasize<br>
differences in lifestyle, but don't hide them either. I'm sure to be asked<br>
questions---mostly curious ones, but occasionally serious ones; so I try to<br>
be ready with a simple answer that is meaningful.<br>
     My research is done at about half a dozen nuclear physics accelerator<br>
laboratories in the United States and Europe where I spend a week or two per<br>
experiment. That (along with writing papers and giving papers at meetings)<br>
gives me plenty of opportunity for interaction, since we work together, eat<br>
together, stay in the same motel room together, etc. Usually we run 24<br>
hours/day and 7 days/week. Getting off on Sabbath usually ends up leading to<br>
questions somewhere along the line. I have had plenty of opportunities to<br>
share what Adventists believe, most of which continue to be opportunities.<br>
Although no one has been baptized as a result, I can still see that the<br>
influence is there. I like to think that maybe Daniel had somewhat similar<br>
results. Here are some examples:<br>
---A girl in a lab I taught at University of Colorado seemed interested in<br>
Adventism so I gave her a copy of The Great Controversy. I guess she<br>
appreciated it because she gave my wife and me a box of chocolates for<br>
Christmas.<br>
---An office mate at CU once told me that any born-again Christian in his<br>
office would get booted out pretty quick. When I suggested that maybe he<br>
would have to boot me out, he said I wasn't a problem because I wasn't always<br>
badgering him.<br>
---I put a paragraph in my dissertation acknowledgements at CU expressing<br>
appreciation that God had made such a marvelous creation to appreciate.<br>
Several years later the wife of a post-doctoral student asked me at length<br>
about SDAs as a result of reading it.<br>
---A fellow student and good friend at CU would occasionally ask me questions<br>
about SDAs. We kept up correspondence until we worked together at University<br>
of Virginia. There he and his wife became quite interested in attending<br>
church with us.<br>
---I worked with a professor from Catholic University of America on an<br>
experiment in Amsterdam. The first Sabbath I explained I couldn't work and he<br>
was very understanding. Unfortunately, however it meant he had to work a 24<br>
hour shift. Fortunately, I was able to repay him several days later when he<br>
wanted to leave on vacation early and I took a 24 hour shift. He has given me<br>
an interesting book he wrote called, "Two Faces of Time," which suggests<br>
relationships between physicists views of time and that of several of the<br>
world religions.<br>
---The professor I worked with at UVa has asked me on several occasions about<br>
Adventist beliefs. His girl friend was studying with Jehovah's Witnesses and<br>
he wanted to know how that related to what SDAs believe. I thought that one<br>
of the main differences was our understanding of who Jesus is, so sent him a<br>
copy of Desire of Ages.<br>
---I go back to UVa about once a year to collaborate on experiments. Each<br>
time one of the other professors asks about my work. I've told him it is<br>
studying the relation between science and religion. He is the one who always<br>
brings up the subject.<br>
---One physics graduate student at UVa was a Christian and believed in a<br>
recent creation. We shared an office with plenty of resulting conversation.<br>
She is a geology doctoral student at CU now and has asked for information on<br>
creation so she will at least have some answers for her professors. She is<br>
giving a paper next week at the Geological Society of America meetings in<br>
Cincinatti, where she plans to get together with our lady geologist from GRI.<br>
---Another student I shared an office with at UVa took a philosophy of<br>
science class and was involved in a very civic minded fraternity that<br>
engendered discussions. A third student there said his brother was a born<br>
again Christian who was always pestering him about being saved. He said he<br>
got tired of that, but didn't mind talking to me.<br>
---When I visited Russia last year to work with several nuclear physicists at<br>
Dubna, I let them know before hand that I couldn't work on Sabbath. As a<br>
result, they made arrangements for me to visit the Moscow church 100km away<br>
even though I hadn't asked for that. In fact one of them attended part of a<br>
church service. The Bibles that I off-handedly gave to two of them, they very<br>
much appreciated. One professor at Moscow State University asked me<br>
extensively about our church, based on TV information she had heard about the<br>
gardens at the Zaokski seminary.<br>
---This summer I spent two weeks on an experiment at Brookhaven on Long<br>
Island, NY. One of the graduate students spent half an hour asking about my<br>
beliefs, and finally said that he wished he could believe too.<br>
---Just last month I spent a week on an experiment at Los Alamos. During the<br>
day shift a janitor would come in and talk awhile. He seemed to have a great<br>
concern about the scientists who were workaholics and spent little time with<br>
their families and then ended up with a divorce. He was impressed with a<br>
scientist who was also a Christian and was studying the interface between<br>
science and religion.<br>
     In these cases and more the approach is probably the same as everyone<br>
else uses: first, the personal element of showing people that you are<br>
interested in them; and second, not hiding your life style but letting them<br>
see that your Christianity makes a positive difference in your life (it makes<br>
you happy and it makes them happy to be associated with you). In thinking<br>
about improving the approach, I would like to have several more book titles<br>
in mind to suggest to people, which I could send to them if they are<br>
interested.<br>
     I'll quit; this is longer than I planned. Hearing some other people's<br>
experiences would give me some encouragement.           ---  Ben Clausen<br>

A couple months ago I posted some numbers from Len McMillan's study on <br>
sexual ethics in the Adventist ministry.  My post raised some questions<br>
which I didn't have time to answer.  I don't remember what those questions<br>
were now, but I'll try to answer them as best I can.<br>
<p>
He starts out by delineating the problems inherent in the ministry<br>
1)  Ministers feel they must deny that they have ever been sexually <br>
tempted, for fear of seeming common.<br>
2)  Ministers may suffer "sin saturation", becoming desensitized to sin<br>
by hearing people's problems day in and day out.<br>
3)  Ministers sometimes forget to take time away from the "things of God"<br>
to spend time with God and their families.<br>
<p>
A Christianity Today survey of ministers  ("Sins of the Body{" p 9-11)<br>
revealed that one in four admitted to having done something sexually<br>
inappropriate since they had entered the ministry.  One in eight confessed<br>
to actually committing adultery since entering the ministry.  Three out of <br>
four said that sex was never talked about or explained in the home in <br>
which they grew up.<br>
<p>
<p>
McMillan has given similar surveys in his seminars to Adventist workers<br>
on sexuality.  The sample he reports has 416 male and 167 female respondents.<br>
More than half of the females were pastor's spouses, 5% were pastors, 19%<br>
were teachers, 7% were counselors.  Of the males, 88% were pastors, 2%<br>
were teachers, 4% were counselors  (his percentages don't add up.)<br>
<p>
Had they ever engaged in premarital sex?  Half of males, 47% of females<br>
answered yes.  The percentage was less for those raised in Adventist homes.<br>
<p>
Had they ever had sex with someone other than their spouse since marriage?<br>
11% males, 10% females answered yes.  12% for those raised in SDA homes.<br>
<p>
Had they ever been attracted to a client/student/parishioner without<br>
actually engaging in sex?<br>
65% of males said yes, 31% of females.<br>
<p>
Would they feel comfortable discussing above attraction with spouse?<br>
47% said no.<br>
<p>
Ever had an affair?  (more broad than sex)<br>
12% of males yes (mostly pastors) 16% of females yes (mostly spouses)<br>
<p>
Ever sexually abused?<br>
6% of males yes, 19% of females,  less in those that grew up in SDA homes.<br>
<p>
He suggests in his last page a suggested code of sexual ethics for<br>
SDA employees, which I won't repeat here.<br>
<p>
Questions, comments?<br>

I've got two things I'd like to say which are related to Steve's post.<br>
<p>
1) Surveys and statistics<br>
<p>
   It is clear that voluntary surveys often do not reflect the<br>
   actual statistics. This is largely attributed to the fact that<br>
   respondents are mostly those who have some kind of motivation <br>
   for responding. In a survey on premarital sex, for example,<br>
   the respondents may largely reflect those that "have" or "did"<br>
   rather than the "haven't" and "didn't" group. Although survey<br>
   results can still be interesting and sometimes meaningful, this<br>
   does need to be considered in order to put the numbers in<br>
   perspective. (Just making an arbitrary correction is not enough<br>
   either, because you can never  predict the response pattern.)<br>
<p>
2) Discussions of sexual behaviour and standards<br>
<p>
   The difficulty in coming up with accurate statistics notwithstanding,<br>
   it is also clear that there is a significant proportion of young<br>
   Adventists today who "have", "did" and sometimes "are". Yet I still<br>
   hear almost every pastor/counsellor, when speaking about sex, <br>
   emphasize the point about "saving yourself" to the exclusion of most<br>
   other things. They say firstly that extramarital sex is wrong, and<br>
   secondly that it's really important to save yourself for the one you<br>
   marry.<br>
<p>
   I agree with both of those points, but it seems to me that the portion<br>
   of the audience who "have" are not being addressed by this message.<br>
   It's a bit like the alcohol one which you have probably heard yourself,<br>
   "you never know whether you're an alcoholic or not until you have a <br>
   drink. One drink is all it might take for you to be hooked, and your<br>
   life will be ruined." That scare-tactic only works for the person who<br>
   has never tasted alcohol, and it may be enough to dissuade them from<br>
   ever doing so. But for a person who has tried it, and is not hooked,<br>
   a more sensible and mature discussion is required.<br>
<p>
   We do need to face up to the reality that Adventist young people, just<br>
   like the rest of Western society, are participating in extramarital<br>
   sex, and that this is increasing. We need to ask ourselves why we<br>
   feel that our beliefs on sexual behaviour are important, and then<br>
   these things need to be the focus of our sermons and discussions.<br>
   Pretending that premarital sex will ruin your sex life forever is not<br>
   a constructive approach, and although "saving yourself" is very<br>
   important it cannot constitute the focus of a message in a time when<br>
   it is too late for a significant proportion of the listeners!<br>
<p>
<p>
Not totally on the topic, I know, but there you have it.<br>
<p>

Tony, I think that some on the SDANET have the idea that there is no<br>
social activity outside of the home for those students that are being home<br>
schooled. That is not the case at all here in the states. There are<br>
periodic "get togethers" with all children that are being home schooled.<br>
The YMCA has a swimming program for instance, for children that are being<br>
home schooled in the county here. In addition to this there are many<br>
educational activities planned for all who are being homeschooled state<br>
wide.<br>
<p>
I know of "clusters" of public school teachers who would not think of<br>
sending their own children to Public school. Some are in our church school<br>
(10 grades) and some are home schooled. In fact I baptized a single parent<br>
(mother) a couple of weeks ago who has been sending her child to our<br>
church school for the last couple of years.<br>

Every week Chester Christie comes to church.  Chester is 65 and not<br>
quite right in the head.  He wanders in and out during the service, but<br>
always waits to see if we're having potluck.  If we are, one of the<br>
women makes sure he gets through line early and gets a seat.  He<br>
generally goes back several times and often takes a plate away with<br>
him afterwards.  If there is no potluck then he asks for a ride down<br>
to the other end of town or somewhere else.  Occasionally his friend<br>
Bill Caudill comes too.  Bill doesn't speak clearly, but he loves to<br>
talk, and at potluck has been known to hold forth on a subject for<br>
10 minutes at a time, with his audience only understanding about every<br>
third word.<br>
<p>
In our congregation of 20-25 (on a good day) these guests are definitely<br>
noticable, by their odor if nothing else.  But they are tolerated and<br>
even welcomed.  We have discussed Jesus' reaction to the outcast of his<br>
day among ourselves, and decided as a congregation to be as genuinely<br>
accepting of these men as possible.  We try to keep in mind the fact that<br>
if you do it unto the least of these, you have done it unto Jesus.<br>
<p>
That doesn't mean that we don't set limits occasionally.  For instance,<br>
Chester collects things in sacks -- junk, aluminum cans, etc.  Often<br>
the sacks are also full of ants and are filthy besides.  One family has<br>
told him that they will take him places, but not the sacks.  I tell him<br>
that the sacks have to go in the bed of the pickup.  Or we limit him<br>
to one destination after church, meaning no, we will not stop and wait<br>
for him to buy milk at the store before taking him on home.  That sort<br>
of thing.<br>
<p>
I know I haven't given any real advice about the problem with the guy<br>
at your church, but thought it might help to hear how it's being handled<br>
somewhere else.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not having a go at anyone here, because I certainly believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; that aspect is important. However my personal concerns with home</i><br>
<i>&gt; schooling are more in the area of socialization.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Russell responds:<br>
<p>
I have 5 kids at home of which 3 are home schooled currently. We made sure <br>
to really investigate the issues involved before taking this step.  We <br>
have found that socialization is not a problem, as a matter of fact studies<br>
show that home schooled kids are better socialized then kids taught<br>
in traditional schooling situations.  <br>
<p>
For a complete discussion on socialization of home schooled kids and the <br>
studies that I mentioned read the book "Home Schooled Kids" by <br>
Dr. Raymond Moore (who also happens to be an SDA).  He is a Phd in <br>
education and has written exhastively about home schooling.  He also<br>
has an excellent show that is broadcast on 3ABN television.  <br>
<p>
To give you a really short summary of the socialization issue the studies<br>
find that home schooled children can interact with all age groups easily<br>
and readily, where traditionally schooled kids develop peer lock and can <br>
only relate well with thier direct peers.  Also the traditionally schooled<br>
kids have a much greater problem with dealing with peer pressure then home<br>
schooled kids due to the dependancy of traditionally schooled kids develop <br>
to peer acceptance.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now there is an argument that says we don't want our children</i><br>
<i>&gt; socialized into modern Western culture. I can see the point in</i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to ensure that as they grow up the adopt the appropriate</i><br>
<i>&gt; values, and that many of these are not widely held today.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
We find that our kids have a better education and also better socialization<br>
then other kids.  It is this reason that we home school rather then trying<br>
to schelter (sp) them from the world.  We find that they relate with the world<br>
much better then thier peers.<br>

Thank you Dave Thomas for the discussion awhile back on the possible<br>
multi-dimensionality of God and the comparison to Flatland.  I read<br>
Flatland years ago but hadn't thought of it since.  This idea of God<br>
being beyond our number of dimensiions and therefore very difficult,<br>
if not impossible, for us to comprehend makes a great deal of sense<br>
to me.  It also makes a lot of our theological arguements somewhat<br>
pointless...   Although I'm not sure I agree with Tony that we will<br>
be embarassed in heaven when we find out hhow wrong we were -- I think<br>
we will just be so overwhelmed and happy to be there that any other<br>
emotions will be insignificant in comparison.<br>

As others have pointed out, a lot depends on the quality of the<br>
various schools, whether public, private, or at home.  Here in our<br>
little church we have some homeschooled kids who I believe would be<br>
schooled at home even if we had a church school nearby, which we don't.<br>
But, they belong to some homeschool cooperatives that organize field<br>
trips, etc. and they are also active in the youth programs of other<br>
(non-SDA) churches in the area.  These kids get PLENTY of interaction<br>
with their peer groups and do not feel at all out of it because they<br>
go to school at home.  Home school doesn't necessarily mean that the<br>
kids are home with just mom all day anymore...<br>
<p>
There is an interest in the educational research field in homeschooling.<br>
However, I haven't seen the lastest reports of what has been found.<br>
Given that I started in public school at age 4, then switched to church<br>
school at 6, I don't feel it did me any harm.  However, I may well<br>
homeschool my children (first one due in 2 weeks!) because I have seen<br>
it work so well for the family here and they could provide me with<br>
all kinds of support and resources.<br>
<p>
Slightly off the topic, but still in the area of socialization of kids,<br>
do you have any idea how hard it is to explain to people why you would<br>
rather they didn't give you baby gifts that are keyed to TV?  Anyone<br>
who asks me what I would like or not like as shower gifts gets this<br>
little spiel from me:  no Sesame Street, no Ninja Turtles, no Little<br>
Mermaid, etc.  We don't have a TV, so these would be meaningless to my<br>
child anyway.  The predominance of these sorts of images in the public<br>
schools is enough to make me consider home schooling, not to mention<br>
the wholeheartedness with which they celebrate Halloween here in KY!<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not having a go at anyone here, because I certainly believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; that aspect is important. However my personal concerns with home</i><br>
<i>&gt; schooling are more in the area of socialization.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Russell responds:<br>
<p>
I have 5 kids at home of which 3 are home schooled currently. We made sure <br>
to really investigate the issues involved before taking this step.  We <br>
have found that socialization is not a problem, as a matter of fact studies<br>
show that home schooled kids are better socialized then kids taught<br>
in traditional schooling situations.  <br>
<p>
For a complete discussion on socialization of home schooled kids and the <br>
studies that I mentioned read the book "Home Schooled Kids" by <br>
Dr. Raymond Moore (who also happens to be an SDA).  He is a Phd in <br>
education and has written exhastively about home schooling.  He also<br>
has an excellent show that is broadcast on 3ABN television.  <br>
<p>
To give you a really short summary of the socialization issue the studies<br>
find that home schooled children can interact with all age groups easily<br>
and readily, where traditionally schooled kids develop peer lock and can <br>
only relate well with thier direct peers.  Also the traditionally schooled<br>
kids have a much greater problem with dealing with peer pressure then home<br>
schooled kids due to the dependancy of traditionally schooled kids develop <br>
to peer acceptance.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now there is an argument that says we don't want our children</i><br>
<i>&gt; socialized into modern Western culture. I can see the point in</i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to ensure that as they grow up the adopt the appropriate</i><br>
<i>&gt; values, and that many of these are not widely held today.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
We find that our kids have a better education and also better socialization<br>
then other kids.  It is this reason that we home school rather then trying<br>
to schelter (sp) them from the world.  We find that they relate with the world<br>
much better then thier peers.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;DaveB</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Our personal experience with home schooling is that it is the best</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;option available for those who have that option.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One of the reasons why I questioned home-schooling in the first place was</i><br>
<i>&gt; because of an experience I had while practice teaching a few years ago.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There was a girl in one of my classes who had not gone to school because her</i><br>
<i>&gt; parents had been caught up in some conservative movement that questioned</i><br>
<i>&gt; the morality and spirituality of both state and SDA schools. When I saw</i><br>
<i>&gt; her she had just begun school against her parents wishes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; She was a 16 year old girl in a class of 14 year olds. She was a very nice, </i><br>
<i>&gt; cooperative student, and aimed to please.I don't know how she was going in </i><br>
<i>&gt; English or History but I know how she was going in Mathematics and Science:</i><br>
<i>&gt; she had no knowledge of these subjects at a high school level at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Her maths teacher was giving her a lot of individual tutoring, starting with</i><br>
<i>&gt; topics from the first year of high school. In science, it was very much the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same. I would be conducting a practical class in science and needed to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; constantly giving her that extra bit of assistance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Russell replys:<br>
<p>
I would, as a home schooling family, state that the most important thing<br>
to remember about home schooling is that you have to be dedicated to home<br>
schooling.  It is not an easy choice and you need to constantly study and <br>
prepare so that  you can give your kids the ultimate education.<br>
<p>
My wife works full time at keeping the home and home schooling the kids.<br>
I help out with the education in the areas that she feels a little lacking.<br>
We make constant trips to the teachers store and spend a significant amount<br>
of funds on magazenes and books.  Anyone can tell that we run a school in our<br>
house when they go the school room and see all of the posters and other school<br>
nicknacks on the wall.  If a parent has trouble in a certain area there are <br>
several excellent correspondance programs to assist.  Of course if the parents<br>
have a complete distrust of anyone from the "establishment" then they will <br>
be reluctant to get any of the needed and available help.<br>
<p>
Please make sure that you don't judge all home schoolers by one or two <br>
problems.  Most of the home schoolers I have met are exceptional!!<br>

I have a question related to a previous discussion about whether Christ<br>
died for Enoch's sins.  My question is about the theological basis for<br>
pre-Messiah resurrection of Moses (and also relates to pre-Messiah<br>
translations of Enoch and Elijah).  What basis did God have for "claiming<br>
victory over death" by these events before victory had actually occurred?<br>
Was it because Christ could not fail in His mission?  If Christ could have<br>
failed, could Enoch, Elijah, and Moses have any "right" to be with God<br>
beforehand from Satan's perspective?  If actual victory was "guaranteed",<br>
then God had a basis for claiming Christ's victory over death before it<br>
happened but then heaven knew all along that God would win the war against<br>
evil and Satan.  From an SDA doctrinal perspective, this is difficult<br>
for me to understand.<br>
<p>
 From an LDS perspective, I can explain this.  But I was wondering if<br>
any of you had thoughts about this issue from SDA doctrine.<br>

 From a (secular) area newspaper article on home schooling from<br>
Sunday October 25 1992:<br>
<p>
``If you think parents who teach their children at home are gambling on<br>
education, think again.  State figures show home-school students<br>
rank one to three years above the national average on standardized tests,<br>
including the widely used California Achievement Test (CAT). ...''<br>

I've noticed that some people who are home schooling are posting from the <br>
state of Michigan.  This is interesting because I knew an SDA family <br>
in Michigan who were home-schooling their children, and as a result of this<br>
when they refused to send the children to public school custody was taken<br>
from the father and stepmother and given to the natural mother of the<br>
children.  It was my understanding of the law that if home schooling is <br>
to be attempted in the state of Michigan, a certified teacher must be<br>
associated with the home school.<br>
Of course, I am also acquainted with several families in a different city<br>
who didn't follow this rule and got away with it.<br>
<p>
The position of most conference education departments (and again I speak<br>
of Michigan as the case I know best) is that as long as there is not a <br>
SDA church school within driving distance, home schooling is fine and they <br>
will support it.  Also for the children of evangelists and such who are <br>
always on the road.  They look less favorably on those who do it to "get<br>
even" with a local church school (and believe me there are plenty of <br>
those cases.)<br>
<p>
Tony mentioned that sometimes those who home school are viewed as anti-<br>
establishment or disloyal.  At one point my home church was faced with <br>
a situation where the pastor decided to home-school his kids for a year,<br>
partly because of a feud with the local teacher.  Resentment built up<br>
against the pastor, and the pastor led a counter-move against the teacher,<br>
which eventually culminated in both of them being asked to move.  (I must say<br>
that at the end of the year his kids were none the worse for wear and<br>
advanced to the next grade normally when they re-entered church school.)<br>
<p>
This has influenced my feelings about home school and was the background<br>
of the statement a few months ago when I made statements about home school<br>
and the Moores that I was trying to retract.  On the other hand, some of the<br>
most kind, cultured, and intelligent people I know have been products of <br>
home schools.<br>

Good questions all, Cheryl, I say. Here are a couple of things that<br>
occurred to me off the top of my head...they're a bit silly, but what<br>
the heck, it *is* one o' clock in the morning...<br>
<p>
Hypothesis 1: God can do whatever he/she wants<br>
<p>
	Maybe God wanted to resurrect Moses, and translate those<br>
	other guys. So, if Jesus hadn't ended up winning the war,<br>
	maybe God would have had to give the gentlemen back to<br>
	Satan in the end.<br>
<p>
Hypothesis 2: God is not subject to chronology<br>
<p>
	We like to say in roundabout ways that God is outside<br>
	of time somehow. So just because we perceive things in<br>
	a certain order doesn't mean that God and everybody<br>
	else is subject to our determination of past and future.<br>
<p>
Hypothesis 3: Everybody knows that Jesus always *was* going to win<br>
<p>
	If God knows all events in space-time then he/she knew<br>
	that Lucifer would rebel, that mankind would rebel, and<br>
	that eventually Jesus would have to become a man and <br>
	die. But God went ahead and created life anyway. Maybe<br>
	sin was inevitable...finite probability, infinite time<br>
	equals inevitable. So the "plan of salvation" really<br>
        was always there, and was not just a fallback measure<br>
        in case things went wrong. Then the predetermination<br>
        of Jesus' death was acceptable, so Enoch, Moses and<br>
        Elijah went ahead in advance.<br>
<p>
<p>
Thought experiments only...no SOP quotes or Bible texts, so don't<br>
think I'm trying to suggest that these ideas be adopted by<br>
anyone with integrity...<br>
<p>
<p>
Tony<br>
<p>
P.S. The secret rapture is supposed to occur in exactly fifty six<br>
     minutes time, according to some guy I saw on the TV news<br>
     earlier. Yes, he did remember to include daylight saving<br>
     which started last weekend.<br>

For those of you who have chosen to home school your kids, I would<br>
be interested to hear whether you have elected to do so as an alternative<br>
to church school, or due to the lack of a church school in your area. The<br>
reason I ask is that some day in the future I could end up working within<br>
the SDA education system, and I would like to be sure I understand the<br>
motivation behind home schooling. I don't know what things are like in<br>
the US, but here in the South Pacific our schools are generally only<br>
just surviving financially, and I know that church members who "withhold"<br>
their kids from the local church school are sometimes viewed with some<br>
disdain by other "loyal" church members. I don't like to misinterpret<br>
what people are doing, so I'd like to hear what you people have to say.<br>
<p>
Also, my feelings regarding home schooling are tempered somewhat by the<br>
types of people who tend to promote it in Australia. Typically these<br>
people will be very right wing, anti-establishment, anti-leadership<br>
and all the other things that go with that mindset. For example, one<br>
such person in my local neighbourhood who has just taken his children<br>
out of school and moved to the country (not that Cooranbong is a<br>
metropolis) is also involved with the publication of a nasty little<br>
paper called "The Protestant". This paper is an independent ministry-<br>
type thing I think, and is very offensive to the general reader. So much<br>
so that when the church authorities couldn't persuade the publishers to<br>
desist, they eventually had to obtain a court order to ensure that the<br>
publication was clearly marked as not officialy sanctioned by the SDA<br>
church. Following this, these guys still print it, and recently it was<br>
mailed to every household in this region. It was also distributed <br>
around the area where the North New South Wales camp meeting was held<br>
a couple of weeks ago. Much of the good relationship which had been<br>
established with the local community was destroyed instantly, when<br>
people discovered what SDAs were "really like".<br>
<p>
I myself am quite the opposite, I am anti-separationist if you like, and<br>
so I have found myself a bit negative towards home schooling partly <br>
because it seems to represent the whole separationist attitude.<br>
<p>
So, home-schoolers, if you do not see yourselves as anti-establishment<br>
and separationist, please let me know, and tell me why you've still<br>
gone ahead and home-schooled your kids!<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
Tony<br>

----&gt;<br>
It also makes a lot of our theological arguements somewhat<br>
pointless...   Although I'm not sure I agree with Tony that we will<br>
be embarassed in heaven when we find out hhow wrong we were -- I think<br>
we will just be so overwhelmed and happy to be there that any other<br>
emotions will be insignificant in comparison.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
That statement was just wishful thinking I suppose. Like, those people<br>
who are so convinced that they are Absolutely Right and that they know<br>
the Answers to some of these difficult issues like the infiniteness of<br>
God, origins, sanctuary doctrines and so on *deserve* to be embarrassed,<br>
with the degree of embarrassment being directly proportional to the<br>
degree of dogmatism. As it is, Lola, you're probably right, and I hope<br>
that the new sinless nature I receive from God, be it before or after<br>
the close of probation ;-), will also mean that I won't care less.<br>

        This is my first visit to SDANet. David Buxton wrote an article in the<br>
NPUC Gleaner on his hobby:computer E-mail. I wrote to him US Mail and received<br>
some interesting info re: previous forays into ferocious forums. Since he did<br>
not include SDANet in his assessment of the darker side of relgious forums, I<br>
thought I might venture myself!<br>

        I am a critical care nurse at Loma Linda University Medical Center in<br>
lovely southern California.(Smog does make beautiful sunsets - to look on the<br>
bright side) Just finished an MPH degree here and am already planning my<br>
escape back home to Oregon, to start a Nurse Practitioner Program in Portland.<br>
        I am very interested in who you all are, where you're from, and, this<br>
time, what your choice is for US Prez.come Nov.3rd. I'm leaning toward<br>
Perot,although a friend said that he is often flanked by catholic priests when<br>
he gives speeches (ominous shades of Malachi Martin!) IMHO, Bush is much too<br>
cozy with the extreme rightists.I am more comfortable with the extreme left<br>
than the right, as the lesser of two evils.I'm afraid that they'll both<br>
continue to spend money we don't have, however. BUSH:Borrow and spend.<br>
CLINTON:Tax and spend.<br>

Sheryl Skinner's post is one of the few who has dared ask the question<br>
of what candidate are people going to support in the US presidential<br>
election.  As moderator, I don't think it's appropriate that I make my<br>
choice known until after the election.  There will be no editorial <br>
endorsements from SDAnet.  (Although now, as opposed to a couple weeks<br>
ago, I have made a choice.)  I must admit it was all a lot simpler back<br>
in the days when God was a Republican and Mrs. White said to vote straight<br>
Republican and no on all the proposals.  (She did say that somewhere,<br>
didn't she?  (&lt;---Note:  Sarcasm alert the last two sentences)<br>
<p>
With apologies to our overseas readers (20% or so) who couldn't care less<br>
about the US elections, we will make a few comments.  Traditionally <br>
religious liberty has been a big concern to SDA voters, although I have<br>
always wondered, why not vote for the most anti-religious freedom<br>
character you can get, thus hastening the Sunday Law, persecution, and<br>
the growth of the church that will result?  In 1984, the issue came up<br>
in the presidential<br>
debate, but in this campaign it's not been mentioned.<br>
<p>
Sheryl voiced concern about Perot.  I attended his rally in Pittsburgh<br>
on Sunday and saw him in person.  It seems to me that he views the<br>
constitution almost as a roadblock; he has proposed more amendments to it<br>
than even Bush has.  <br>
<p>
None of the candidates has mentioned HR2797, the Religious Freedom<br>
Restoration Act, which Bush might well have signed but which died in<br>
committee due to much lobbying from anti-abortion groups, based on the<br>
false notion that it is really designed to protect abortion rights. <br>
Note that this act is sponsored in the Senate by Senator Kennedy (you<br>
know what religion he is.)  <br>
<p>
I think we face an election where the choice is important but not obvious.<br>
If anyone has more information on the religious liberty stands of the<br>
candidates, be sure to let us know.<br>

I must confess that I have not been reading all of the discussion on home<br>
schooling that has been transpiring so pardon me if I point out something<br>
that has already been mentioned.<br>
<p>
While I am very much in agreement with the concepts of home schooling (I<br>
have 5 nephews and 2 nieces who are/were home schooled) there is a<br>
significant factor that I feel may skew home schooling effectiveness<br>
statistics to the positive end of the scale.  A number of those who home<br>
school in the U.S. are people who might be considered economically or<br>
professionally advantaged over the broader population.  Most of the home<br>
schooling situations that I am personally acquainted with involved families<br>
that would not be considered representative of the population as a whole. <br>
I read of one home schooling situation where both parents were PhD's<br>
teaching at a major university when one of them (I don't remember which)<br>
left their teaching position to home school their only child.  While having<br>
a PhD does not necessarily mean that someone will be a good teacher, I<br>
suspect that a home environment of that sort would result in an educational<br>
experience that would likely give the child(ren) a good likelihood of<br>
scoring high on standardized tests.<br>

I have heard through two or three grapevines that the GC/NAD religious<br>
liberty dept is encouraging people to vote for Clinton due to Supreme Court<br>
appointee considerations.  I  cannot back these rumors up with any hard<br>
facts but I can believe that they are true. (sounds like Ross Perot)<br>
<p>
My personal assessment of the contest goes something like this:<br>
I generally agree with many of Clinton's ideas but I don't think he'll<br>
actually be able to accomplish them because he's indebted to too many<br>
special interests.  I also have a hard time trusting (that trust thing)<br>
that what he says is really what he believes.<br>
<p>
I like a lot of the ideas/attitudes of Perot but I have a major<br>
disagreement with his ideas on foreign relations, free trade, etc.  I am<br>
American who believes that it is inevitable that the rest of the world will<br>
"catch up" with our lifestyle.  If we try to use the White House as a<br>
"bully pulpit" to convince Mexico, Japan, the EC, etc. that we want fair<br>
trade but intend to "stay ahead" of them in wages, it will eventually lead<br>
to the isolation of the U.S. from the rest of the world.<br>
<p>
Then there's our incumbant.  I don't like the fact that he cozy's up to the<br>
religious right, his Supreme Court appointees tend to be a little too<br>
conservative for me, and I don't feel he's put much effort into trying to<br>
cooperate with an "uncooperative" congress.  I like most of his foreign<br>
policy, hate what he's done on education and the environment, and don't<br>
totally blame him for our economic.  I will probably end up voting for him<br>
or perhaps Perot.  I'm 90% certain I will not vote for Clinton.<br>
<p>
There is some interesting data on North American SDA political opinions<br>
that was published recently in "Focus" which is the Andrews University<br>
alumni magazine (I personally think "Focus" is one of the most<br>
professionally designed, written, and edited journals in Adventism - yes, I<br>
am a proud alumnus) and I believe I also saw the same article or a<br>
condensation in the "Adventist Review."  It pointed out how many SDA's have<br>
relatively liberal views, staunchly support church/state separation, and<br>
still end up voting republican.  Guess I'm just one of the crowd.<br>

*** Reply to note of 10/28/92 07:30<br>
<p>
I saw Clinton in a town hall type meeting held in Seattle and broadcast<br>
in the Pacific Northwest.  He is the only candidate I've heard say is<br>
is strongly for the separation of Church and State.<br>
<p>
As for Perot, I read a speach he made last spring to the National Press<br>
Club in Washington DC.  It was a typical Perot speech.  The interesting<br>
comment in the speech was about the national election being on a Tuesday<br>
and how he thought it should be on a Saturday &amp; Sunday, both days "so<br>
the Seventh Day Adventists could vote too".  The only notable point of<br>
this is that of all the religous organizations he could have named, he<br>
picked SDA's.<br>

<i>&gt; Sheryl voiced concern about Perot.  I attended his rally in Pittsburgh</i><br>
<i>&gt; on Sunday and saw him in person.  It seems to me that he views the</i><br>
<i>&gt; constitution almost as a roadblock; he has proposed more amendments to it</i><br>
<i>&gt; than even Bush has.  </i><br>
<p>
	Interesting.  I don't have many ways of collecting information about<br>
candidates and I haven't heard anything about that.  I do know that he has<br>
taken up the "family values" issue in a different way than Bush has.  I<br>
guess my question is what are these ammendments that he is proposing?  I<br>
really have no idea (I don't get a newspaper nor have a TV and rarely<br>
listen to the radio.)<br>
	My personal view on this is that there are two aspects.  First, we<br>
as a people are given stewardship of managing a government, so we have to<br>
excercise good judgment and vote for the candidate we think will do the best<br>
job.  Second, we have to realize that through it all, God is really in control<br>
of everything.  When the time is right, I think there will be a Sunday law<br>
passed no matter who's president.  Where the two intersect is that we should<br>
not empower a president that will make it difficult to finnish God's work<br>
and delay his coming.<br>
	If you feel this more of a political thread than a real SDA-related<br>
topic then I'd appreciate any private replies.  Thanx.<br>

Lola and I have been having a little discussion on the dimensionality. <br>
I thought it would be good for me to start posting since my response<br>
digresses and invlolves other aspects of how we as SDA's conceptualize<br>
God.<br>
<p>
	I think you will get the idea by following:<br>
<p>
Lola responds to my letter:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Thanks for your direct comments Trevor, and I can see your point about</i><br>
<i>&gt;not wanting to forsake logic when we come to something difficult to</i><br>
<i>&gt;understand.  However, I also see a danger on the other side:  that we</i><br>
<i>&gt;try to force God into our own boxes (of however many dimensions) and</i><br>
<i>&gt;then insist that He is like we imagine Him to be!  That's why the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Flatland analogy appealed to me -- the two-dimensional world has no</i><br>
<i>&gt;conception of what three dimensions are like, so would find it</i><br>
<i>&gt;difficult to explain 3-dimensional phenomena.  Same here with us.  We</i><br>
<i>&gt;only are good at understanding what happens with regularity HERE --</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't think we can explain a lot about God and heaven and time, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;by using the earth as a model.  I'm always happy to hear people try,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but I reserve judgement on their accuracy!</i><br>
<p>
	My letter here is going to get off your original point, but I  think it<br>
informative to analyze exactly what dimensions are.  There seems to be a<br>
misunderstanding as to what two dimensions and three dimesnions are. <br>
They are only labels, describing area and volume.  In a two dimensional<br>
world, you have area but no volume.  In a three dimensional world you<br>
have  area AND volume.  It is a little absurd to think that anything in<br>
either dimenion can comprehend anything.  Cones in three dimensions<br>
cannot understand circles in two dimesnions, spheres in three<br>
dimensions, or hyperspheres in four dimensions.  The only things that<br>
can understand anything are humans.  But just because we are in three<br>
dimensions does not mean there is a major fundamental misunderstanding<br>
of higher dimensions.  There is no reason to think that anything above<br>
three dimensions is visual.  Dimensions could also lable color, and<br>
black and white. Let dimension 1 be black (can't see a thing), dimension<br>
2 be black and white (can see some things), dimension 3 be color(can see<br>
lots of different things).   What is beyond color?  who knows?  Our<br>
visual sense is only a way to interact in the world.  We say the world<br>
is 3-dimensional, because that is how we have described it.  There is<br>
nothing intrinsic about it.  To show you that different dimensions can<br>
relate think of a computer.  A computer only sees information in a two<br>
dimensional world.  Yet computers model three dimensional problems and<br>
solve them all the time.  We use them in physics constantly.   Further,<br>
we model 4, 5, on up to infinite dimensions on computers. So it is<br>
possible to comprehend, and even talk about other dimensions; you just<br>
have to be very careful when doing so. <br>
<p>
	One other point.  I agree that we should not try to put God in our own<br>
little box.  What is interesting is that we use this argument of not<br>
being able to understand him, in order to refute those who go against<br>
OUR conception of God.  Why do we insist on using ONLY the Bible to base<br>
our conception of God. Further, why is OUR interpretation of the Bible<br>
the right conception of God.  By doing this, we constrain God.  You<br>
might even say we make him 1-dimensional.  Certainly we make him dated.<br>
	<br>
	I doubt that anyone of us has the same connception of God.  We all have<br>
similar conceptions, hence we are Seventh-day Adventists.  But all the<br>
arguments within the church have to do with our different conceptions of<br>
what God is.  I think we get into serious trouble when we base our<br>
conception of God only on the Bible.  There is no way women in our<br>
church are going to be ordained ministers by basing our conception of<br>
God solely on the Bible.  It just isn't there.  Many people have not<br>
understood the history of the Bible nor read it completely.  The Bible<br>
is flat out sexist when it comes to women.  That does not mean it isn't<br>
a good book; or maybe even the best book.  But ordaining women is<br>
unbiblical.  But is ordaining women Ungodly? I don't think so.  I think<br>
the Bible seriously misrepresents God on this point.<br>
<p>
	Sorry about all the digression.  These are only my opinions. <br>
<p>

While not endorsing any candidate, and still making up my mind.  I think<br>
it should be noted that Perot's amendments have no religious goals in<br>
mind.  They might effect religion, but this certianly isn't his issue. <br>
Bush on the other hand tries to represent a section of religion and thus<br>
knows full well the implications of his ammendments.  Perot seems<br>
interested in making the constitution work better for our country.  The<br>
question is whether he can do it correctly.<br>
<p>
Note:  The constitution was written when people needed "rights."   There<br>
is no denying that we still need rights.  However, economics and history<br>
professors are noticing that this has been to the exclusion of any<br>
efficiency.  The country now is often hampered by the constitution. <br>
Japan's Constitution was set up in the 1940's and therefore reflects a<br>
more management style constitution.  Ours is still in the dark ages.  We<br>
are the only major industrialized country in the world that allows<br>
ordinary citizens to purchase handguns.  It is no wonder that our muder<br>
rate is more than double ALL of Europe.  In fact the murder rate in New<br>
York City alone is higher than all of England and France combined.<br>

A couple weeks ago in the Review there was a short note that the<br>
SE California Conference had failed to elect a president in a long<br>
constituency meeting, and had scheduled another meeting.  The office<br>
of president has apparently been vacant there since July.<br>
<p>
Since we have a correspondent from that office now, I'm wondering if <br>
any further information is available on this.  If memory serves, it was<br>
only a year or so ago that another stormy constituency meeting occured<br>
in that conference on the issue of the ordination of women.<br>

<i>&gt; As moderator, I don't think it's appropriate that I make my</i><br>
<i>&gt; choice known until after the election.  There will be no editorial </i><br>
<i>&gt; endorsements from SDAnet.</i><br>

<p>
Steve, you wear two hats:  you are the moderator of SDAnet, and you<br>
are an individual named Steve Timm.  While it might be true that<br>
an endorsement from the net moderator is inappropriate, the position<br>
of individual subscribers is significant.  I find it sad that you<br>
cannot distinguish who you are.  Even sadder if you think that we<br>
can't.  If you won't say for whom you are voting before the election,<br>
spare us the details afterwards.<br>
<p>
As for me, currently I'm supporting Perot.  However, because my<br>
closest advisor is pressing me to continue my former support of Bush,<br>
I am reserving my final decision until November 3.<br>

In this week's Review there is a short description of Annual Council<br>
actions including the voting of a statement on abortion, the first<br>
since 1971.  The text is promised by the December 31 issue.  Does anyone<br>
know how to obtain it sooner?<br>
<p>
It's also interesting to hear that R. Folkenberg (President of denomination)<br>
called for a vision of the church mission that is big enough to include<br>
member-run supporting ministries.  <br>
<p>
On one hand it is interesting because the church is breaking silence on <br>
something so important to so many people, but again it is disheartening<br>
because again we are getting into the business of deciding truth by <br>
majority vote.<br>

<i>&gt; From: PHTH1@cc.newcastle.edu.au</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For those of you who have chosen to home school your kids, I would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be interested to hear whether you have elected to do so as an alternative</i><br>
<i>&gt; to church school, or due to the lack of a church school in your area.</i><br>
<p>
We have a local SDA elementary school.  Our two daughters were home-schooled<br>
'till they were 9, then to the local school for a few years...<br>
<p>
We pulled them out after an horrific year involving a teacher/principal who<br>
finally was unable to keep his stories straight (I got one line, my wife got<br>
another, the kids got a third, and so on).  In any case, we pulled them out<br>
and went back to homeschooling.  We tried, though.  Really.  (He ended up<br>
calling the school board chairman one day in July and said, thanks, but I<br>
have a new position in another state, so don't expect me or my wife to be<br>
teaching the next session.  We'll ignore the financial issues which got<br>
cleared up during the next two years.)<br>
<p>
Rather than jerk the girls around in and out, we've kept them at home and<br>
put in the extra time and effort.  (Scholastically, the effort has been<br>
rewarded quite nicely.  In other areas, things have improved, too.)<br>
<p>
Socialization? I believe that both girls do better than their local peers,<br>
having to deal with people ranging from younger children to adults (most of<br>
their peers spend most of their time interacting with the same group of kids<br>
from grades school through high school.  Not all, but most.)<br>
<p>
I did have one fellow castigate me for "depriving" our kids of the<br>
inestimable benefits of regular television viewing: "...how can they hope to<br>
relate to their peers?..."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So, home-schoolers, if you do not see yourselves as anti-establishment</i><br>
<i>&gt; and separationist, please let me know, and tell me why you've still</i><br>
<i>&gt; gone ahead and home-schooled your kids!</i><br>
<p>
I have come to the feeling that formal schools are there for those<br>
families who are unable to devote time and resources to teaching their<br>
own children.  There are things that you can't do at home, but I feel that<br>
they are more than balanced out by the greater flexibility available to the<br>
home schooler: how long can a typical teacher afford to work with a single<br>
student who just doesn't seem to be able to "get" some basic part of<br>
algebra, or skim by unnecessary background to let a student maintain momentum<br>
when she's got it cold from the start.  (Or set up and run a baking business,<br>
or agricultural/science project for a third-grader or...)<br>
<p>
We still support the local school, btw, with things like computer equipment<br>
support, revising and reprinting the school bulletin, and so on.<br>
<p>
We're also planning on sending the girls to academy (probably Weimar, as far<br>
as we can tell right now) for two years before college, and from there to<br>
(probably) PUC.<br>
<p>
Some things we feel we can do better, some things the schools can do better,<br>
we try to figure out which is best for our kids and move accordingly.<br>
<p>
We pay taxes for the public schools that we don't use, we pay tithe and offering<br>
for the church schools (whether using them or not)...but others do need what the<br>
schools offer, so that's OK with me.<br>
<p>
Wonder where the money for college is going to come from, sometimes.<br>

Tonight on CNN there was a story about an 18 year old woman who is<br>
legally dead but is being kept on life support because she is pregnant.<br>
The woman is in a German hospital and is only 15 weeks along.  The doctors<br>
will keep her on life support until March 1993 when the baby will be near<br>
term.  Then they will deliver the baby by Cesearean section and then<br>
disconnect life support.  In fact, the death certificate has already been<br>
filled out according to the news story.<br>
<p>
What do you think about this?  Apparently the Pope has voice deep concern<br>
about the ethics of keeping a woman alive solely for this purpose.  Can<br>
you imagine the expense involved in this?  The grandparents have voiced<br>
strong support in keeping their daughter in this state until their grand-<br>
child is born.  They have been encouraged by the doctors to bring in toys<br>
and objects that make noice to "stimulate" the baby.  They have also been<br>
advised to hug and touch the woman's body as much as possible for the<br>
baby's sake.<br>
<p>
What do think about the effects this may have on the child?  Could it have<br>
serious consequences on its development and intellect?  Just curious. <br>
<p>
Personally, I think this is morally and ethically wrong.  To keep a dead<br>
person on life support solely as an incubator seems inhumane.  There is no<br>
question that this woman is brain-dead.  There is no chance (short of a<br>
true miracle) that she will live once life support is disconnected.<br>
<p>
What do you think about this?<br>

Are you sure the document was a majority vote affair?  I understand that it<br>
was a consensus paper.  And, as far as I know, no one pretends it is truth.<br>
That the Review will not publish it until December is due to the way publishing<br>
goes.  The Review is prepared months in advance, except for the Newsbreak <br>
section.  The paper is out, but too long for me to transcribe.<br>

If you want to check out a truly ferocious forum, try the skeptics<br>
mailing list. I subscribed to it for a while, and at the time there<br>
was a hot debate going on between a couple of Christians and some<br>
of the skeptics. One of the Christians was doing an admirable job,<br>
I might add. Don't subscribe to that list unless you want to hear<br>
some very negative things about religion in general and Christianity<br>
in particular!<br>
<p>
The worst thing about it all was that some of them were true...!<br>

You didn't mention fractal dimensions.  I think the complexity of fractals<br>
applies nicely to the discussion on the nature of God.  Fractal dimension<br>
basically quanifies how something changes in mass in relation to scale.<br>
The common coastline example demonstrates that the smaller the scale used<br>
to measure it, the longer the coastline gets.  Likewise with the God.  The<br>
smaller we try to make Him, the greater He becomes.<br>

This post is from Steve Hix<br>
[...Steve, I know this falls outside the normally-set<br>
limits of discussion in this group, but the comments<br>
below slipped through, and some corrections ought to<br>
be made...]<br>
[  I'm allowing all sorts of "politics" comments until the election.<br>
After all, the SDA church is as political as any other place.  SCT]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From st0o+@andrew.cmu.edu Wed Oct 28 18:57:53 1992</i><br>
<i>&gt; We are the only major industrialized country in the world that allows</i><br>
<i>&gt; ordinary citizens to purchase handguns.</i><br>
<p>
This is incorrect (although widely believed).  I have personal<br>
contact with citizens of many of the countries implied in the<br>
comment above, and almost without exception they have given me<br>
the required procedures for legally owning handguns in each of<br>
their respective countries.  (Most generally begin by the person<br>
joining a local shooting club.  Costs, pre-requisites, etc. change<br>
with the country in question.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is no wonder that our muder rate is more than double ALL of Europe.</i><br>
<p>
Two points: <br>
<p>
1. The comparatively-lower homicide rates predate anti-gun<br>
   legislation in those countries whose rates are below the U.S. <br>
   (England, for instance had a rate about 1/16 ours when the<br>
   first laws passed around 1920, currently, their rate is about<br>
   1/4 ours.  Not a net gain.)<br>
<p>
2. If one subtracts the rates of about 10 major cities in the<br>
   U.S., such as New York City, Washington, D.C., Detroit, Chicago,<br>
   Los Angeles, etc., the remaining rate is at or below european<br>
   levels.  (Note that most of these cities prohibit or restrict<br>
   legal gun ownership: the laws aren't obviously helping.)<br>
<p>
The problem with gun laws is that the ones who obey them aren't<br>
the ones who cause most, if not all, of the trouble.  The laws<br>
are trying to deal with a symptom (if that) and ignoring the<br>
root problem, which is sin.  (It wouldn't be so bad, but the<br>
cure seems to make things worse, for a number of reasons I<br>
won't go into now.)<br>
<p>
I used to be strongly pro-gun-control, but I have reluctantly<br>
come to the decision that as a solution to a problem, it's<br>
barking up the wrong tree.  (It's a solution that is simple,<br>
elegant, and ineffective.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In fact the murder rate in New York City alone is higher than</i><br>
<i>&gt; all of England and France combined.</i><br>
<p>
Let's not mix up rates and raw numbers. Not the same thing.  :}<br>
<p>
If anyone wants to discuss/argue this or related subjects, you've <br>
got my email address.  This belongs offline.<br>
<p>
Back to our normal programming...  :}<br>

What is the difference in turning off the life support and letting the<br>
baby die and abortion? Shouldn't the child have a chance to live if we<br>
can at all make it possible? When my 8-month-pregnant sister-in-law was<br>
killed in an automobile accident, the baby died, too. What if the baby<br>
had been able to be saved? Be it a month or more, doesn't it make sense<br>
to try to preserve life rather than snuff it out?<br>

Having grown up in the SE California Conference I can tell you that no<br>
one really wants that job.  They (the conference leaders) lead the<br>
candidate to believe that he or she can run the conference  through his<br>
or her vision, but it is impossible to do so.  The president of the<br>
conference ends up being squeezed, by the local and general conference. <br>
While former president Gifford hasn't stated why he resigned, I can see<br>
why he stepped down.  Several times he tried to implement changes, and<br>
every time he was shot down. <br>
<p>
	The SE California Conference, has many large SDA institutions<br>
represented in it, and all of them are very powerful.  The LLU Medical<br>
Center, La Sierra University, Loma Linda Foods, University Church, etc. <br>
By the way, all of these institutions have there own problems, which<br>
makes it even more difficult.  Both La Sierra and LLU have financial<br>
problems, and LLU has been severley criticized by an independent<br>
academic freedom committee, which essentially said that it doesn't like<br>
the gastopo tactics used there.  Of course the attempt to unify the two<br>
universities has now put more than a few people at odds with eachother<br>
(Heavenly isn't it?).  <br>
<p>
	A similar vacancy problem occurred when Louis Venden left the<br>
University Church.  This is the largest SDA church in the country, and<br>
in the center of many of these other institutions.  They had to get Bill<br>
Loveless, former president of CUC, because he was really the only person<br>
with the experience to run the university church (he was the pastor<br>
before Louis Venden).  This church is not like running any other church.<br>
 You have to be more than a minister.  You really have to be a good<br>
politician.  I'm not making any analogies to American politics <br>
whatsoever.  My point is that if you are not a good politician, you will<br>
be pushed around by all of the other organizations there.  You have to<br>
live there to know what I mean.<br>

There is deep cause for concern when one considers the Religious Right's<br>
agenda to make the U.S. a Christian nation. It is this political interst<br>
group which took credit for Reagan-Bush's election. Bush has not forgotten<br>
his debt to this organization. Consider:<br>
	* his record of Supreme Court nominees (Thomas, especially)<br>
	* his speech to religious broadcasters the day after the<br>
	  Republican Convention proclaiming that God was in the<br>
	  Republican platform and blaming the Democrats for leaving<br>
	  God out of theirs<br>
	* the Pat Robertson-organized Christian Warriors who are<br>
	  backing Bush and who will want pay back if he returns to office<br>
	* Bush's statement on the record that he will do anything to<br>
	  get elected.<br>
<p>
The balance of the Supreme Court is a serious issue. Although some may<br>
rate it way down the line when prioritizing the issues, remember that<br>
Justice Blackmun may retire soon creating another vacancy to be filled<br>
by the next president. This is a Court very interested in religious issues.<br>
Already for the 1992-93 term, the Court has accepted three church-state<br>
cases. The Court was split on the Weisman case (prayer at graduations) 5-4<br>
indicating how close these church-state issues are.<br>
<p>
Gov. Clinton has made clear his stand on separation of church and state.<br>
We can also look at his record of judicial appointments in Arkansas for<br>
a clue to the types of judges he appoints. He has a strong record for<br>
appointing minorities and women indicating his interest in balance.<br>
<p>
I became a much better informed Adventist by researching Jerry Falwell's<br>
attempt to get tax-free bonds for Liberty University. The Supreme Court<br>
of Virginia unanimously ruled against him on the issue of Separation of<br>
Church and State. However, the Religious Right was very interested in<br>
appealing this case to the Supreme Court as a test since they believe<br>
Christians are discriminated against since they are Christians. The<br>
expense and a technicality (the case was not in Liberty University's name)<br>
prevented the appeal. I was shocked at the deceit used in the case<br>
to represent Liberty University as a secular school in order to get<br>
the funding. I wrote a two-part article on this fascinating case.<br>
(Forgive me for saying it won a Society of Professional Journalists<br>
Mark of Excellence Award and the Associated Church Press's Award<br>
of Merit.) <br>
<p>
See this week's Washington Post Nation Weekly Edition (Oct.26-Nov. 1)<br>
for the article, "The Supreme Court Gets Religion," page 33.<br>
<p>
<p>
If you have access to a University Library, you might want to read<br>
an eye-opening chapter in the second edition of MEDIATED POLITICAL<br>
REALITIES, by Dan Nimmo and James E. Combs, Chapter 9, "The Fantasies<br>
of Religious Movements: Political Perspectives of Contemporary Evangelists."<br>

Two postings regarding the upcoming election raised some questions that I<br>
would like to address.  Since it's about politics AND religion, I won't<br>
hazard an opinion as to whether it is more heat or light...<br>
<p>
Like many voters, I find myself frustrated at the lack of moderate,<br>
responsible canditates, i.e., one with the courage to face up to fiscal<br>
realities but without a punitive social agenda.  Where are our Jeffersons<br>
and Madisons?<br>
<p>
While I appreciate Mr Perot's call to fiscal responsibility, and even find<br>
some of his proposals reasonable (higher fuel/tobacco taxes and lower<br>
defense budgets have been a mainstay argument of publications like the<br>
Economist for years!), it is all too obvious that the only way he could<br>
run the country on his own terms is by getting changes to the<br>
constitution.  Are we as a people this close to buying in to "emergency<br>
dictitorial power"?<br>
<p>
Mr Bush has practiced too much borrow and spend, and his links to the<br>
Religious Right are all too evident in his handling of anti-abortion,<br>
school prayer, and school voucher issues.  More tangibly, and with even<br>
more devastating long-term effect, are his right wing appointments to the<br>
US Supreme Court.  One more ultra-conservative on the court could trigger<br>
an avalanche of changes to the constitution and this nation as we know it.<br>
<p>
Mr Clinton's party has a long, expensive history of tax and spend.  Yet he<br>
has been the only canditate to make any clear separationist statement.  To<br>
qoute from his 11 Sept speech at Notre Dame, "All of us must respect the<br>
reflection of God's image in every man and woman and so we must value<br>
their  freedom, not just their political freedom, but their freedom of<br>
conscience in matters of family and philosophy and faith. ... Our freedom<br>
of conscience depends on mutual respect. ... I have been appalled to hear<br>
the voices of intolerance raised ... that some Americans aren't real<br>
Americans, and ... that what this country needs is a religious war.  Well,<br>
America does not need a religious war. ..."  <br>
<p>
Personally, I consider myself a political conservative.  So conservative,<br>
I tell my friends, that I am very nearly a Libertarian  (you know,<br>
someone who manages to infuriate both sides!).  This year, I have to put<br>
my consience and Jeffersonian ideals together with a hope that maybe,<br>
just maybe, Mr Clinton is not all rhetoric, and that the Democratic Party<br>
has learned something about fiscal reality.<br>
<p>
The difficulty I have (and I hope it was a rhetorical question) with<br>
voting for the least separationist canditate (either Perot or Bush) and<br>
therefore speed up the eschatological horrors, is that I cannot be part<br>
of the problem.  I will only appeal to biblical instances such as<br>
Abraham, Moses, etc., tried to accelerate God's plan ...<br>
 <br>
The latest issues of Liberty Magazine and Church &amp; State have several<br>
articles that I hope U.S. voters will take time to find (check with any<br>
SDA conference) and read.  Mr Clinton's speech should be available via. a<br>
local newspaper or the Democratic Party. (when I read excerpts in these<br>
magazines, and saw last night's posting, I had a copy of the full speech<br>
faxed to me, about 11 pages) <br>

In for a dime, in for a dollar!  Sorry this is so long...<br>
<p>
The Southeastern California Conference (we use 'SECC' freqently!) met for<br>
its 7th Triennial Session on September 20 with four "major" issues:<br>
  1) Election of President<br>
  2) Authority/Relationship of Minority Leaders<br>
  3) Position on Gender Inclusiveness &amp; Ordination<br>
  4) Tithe Percentage<br>
<p>
SECC's requirements for conducting constituency sessions include: small<br>
meetings in various parts of the territory with delegates, for the<br>
purposes of discussing potential agenda items; the election of a<br>
nominating committee 7 weeks prior to the meeting; and that the committee<br>
and session chairpersons are not (unless so elected) the Union President.<br>
All toward the good end of open and democratic process as befits a<br>
representative form of governance.<br>
<p>
There was clear evidence of caucusing taking place when certian minority<br>
groups promoted uniform "straw votes" when polled at the various delegate<br>
meetings.<br>
The nominating committee received over 60 different names for the<br>
position of President, and finally nominated a relative unknown, Mr Craig<br>
Newborn.  He served as a teacher in San Diego Academy, then<br>
teacher/minister/administrator in Keyna, Iran, Lebanon, and then returned<br>
to the US where he currently serves as a bible teacher at Loma Linda<br>
Academy.  He was opposed by a vocal group in the African-American<br>
community (he is black) who preferred another name, and by the<br>
denominational heirarchy, who protested his qualifications.<br>
On the 20th, the vote on rules and agenda was delayed 4 hours by<br>
arguments and positioning from both opposing sides.  When Mr Newborn's<br>
name was put to the delegation, a motion to refer back to the nominating<br>
committee was, after some argument, passed.<br>
<p>
The delegation turned to reports and other business while waiting for the<br>
committee.  Among them was a proposal from the Gender Inclusiveness Task<br>
Force, a group established by mandate of the 1989 constituency.  The text<br>
of this proposal runs a full page and I can transcribe it if enough of you<br>
want it.  The heart of the proposal is:<br>
	... because of the gender discrimiation which that vote [1990 GC<br>
Session] represents, we request our conference leaders to devise a plan by<br>
which qualified women ministers whom we employ be ordained for ministry<br>
within our jurisdiction of the world church ...  SECC desires to eliminate<br>
further discrimination in our conference by uniformly conducting all<br>
future ordinations of qualified men and women ministers, ...<br>
This proposal passed (328/254) with little objection from the floor. <br>
Later on the 18th, a motion to take things even farther by removing the<br>
Union from the ordination process (it is standard that conferences merely<br>
recommend names to the union office, who then approve/deny ordination<br>
credentials) was defeated 214/272.<br>
The current feeling is that "uniformly conducting" may well mean that SECC<br>
will, until policies change at higher levels, forward NO names for<br>
ordination.  It is amazing how much heat that the MEN now have on this<br>
subject!<br>
<p>
The delegation proceeded with several constitutional changes, including<br>
naming the African-American, Asian, and Hispanic coordinators as Vice<br>
Presidents (they serve under the President, Secretary, and Treasurer)<br>
which then gives them permanent voting privileges on the Executive<br>
Committee.  That committee was then enlarged by 3 lay positions to<br>
maintain a 50% lay representation. <br>
<p>
The nominating committee reaffirmed after 5 hours of discussion the name<br>
of Mr Newborn.  Bitter debate and more parlimentary jockying followed,<br>
culminating in a vote against Mr Newborn, 202/361.<br>
The nominating committee immediately named Dr David Taylor, an<br>
African-American who has served in many churches, in 3 conferences as<br>
associate youth director (SE, Central and Northern Calif), and a religion<br>
professor at Oakwood and PUC.  He currenly serves as Vice President at<br>
Pacific Union Conference.  <br>
It seemed to the delegates that the nominating committee had even more<br>
names that evening, but we will never know.  Temporary chairman Richard<br>
Bates nearly spilled those beans, but an African-American representative<br>
of the nominating committee stalked up the front of the podium, seemingly<br>
grabbed the chairman, and made it clear he would not tolerate the spread<br>
of the name(s).  Within short order a quorum call was made, it was found<br>
that we were 10 delegates short, and the meeting dissolved at 9:30pm<br>
<p>
When reconvened on October 18, Dr Taylor had withdrawn his name, and the<br>
Nominating committee selected Dr Lynn Mallery, recently appointed<br>
Conference Secretary, previously Ministerial Director.  He has served as<br>
pastor in various churches including La Sierra, and was a professor of<br>
applied theology at La Sierra for 8 years.  With no debate he was elected<br>
on a 463/147 vote.  Gerald Penick, formerly director of African-American<br>
ministries, was elected Secretary (494/135), and Philip Robertson<br>
reelected treasurer (568/58).  Pastor Anthony Paschal (Riverside Kansas<br>
Avenue) was elected VP African American ministries (412/37), and Mario<br>
Perez was reelected VP Hispanic ministries (424/20).  The Asian group (no<br>
such thing as ONE asian group!) could not agree, and the delegates<br>
deferred to the Asian Caucus for further study.<br>
<p>
The tithe question, at one time considered the most controversial agenda<br>
item because it had suggested that the contribution sent by SECC be<br>
reduced from 20% to 19%, or about $300,000.  Cool heads prevailed, and it<br>
was voted that SECC, the Pacific Union, North America, and the General<br>
Conference continue to work out ways to allow North America to put more<br>
funds back into its own ministries, particularly at the local church<br>
level.<br>
<p>
We adjourned at 6:30 pm, exhausted but satisfied.  I can report that the<br>
office morale seems to be higher, a mental and in some cases physical<br>
logjam of work has broken open, and there is a slowly reemerging team<br>
spirit.  All of us are (and continue to be) thankful for the prayers and<br>
concerns raised up by God's people around the circle of faith.<br>

In recent years I have found many thoughtful Christians are reconsidering<br>
how they celebrate certain Western holidays/festivities.  Despite the<br>
undisputed heathen origins of the days selected for Christmas and Easter,<br>
we can chose to celebrate the birth of Christ and His death &amp; resurrection<br>
on and around these days (and hopefully other times in the year as well).<br>
However, the Catholic observations of All Saints's Eve/Halloween (much <br>
different emphasis in Europe than in N.America) and All Saints Day have<br>
left many Protestants unsure of what to do .. and hence they go along with<br>
the Halloween aspect.  If you are not aware of its Satanic origins, I<br>
recommend you look this up.  Suffice it to say that the increasing level<br>
of overt occult trappings among adults, let alone children, during this<br>
time should give any Christian serious pause.<br>
<p>
I do not recall any Christian ever questioning Trick or Treating as I was<br>
growing up.  No one ever mentioned that the origin was/is for treats to be<br>
left out for the spirits lest they play some dirty trick; indeed it was<br>
transformed into a time of convivial shenanigans and sugar treats (enough<br>
to depress your immune system for a serious amount of time what with winter<br>
coming on and all).<br>
<p>
When we had children we determined to find a Godly focus for this time<br>
of year.  What we found was:  Oct 31 (some historians say Nov 1, but I find<br>
the weight of evidence for Oct 31) was the day Martin Luther nailed his<br>
95 Theses to the door of the church in Wittenburg.  Some Protestants<br>
refer to this as Reformation Day.  We have found this to be far preferable.<br>
<p>
When Ronald Reagan named Jeanne Kirkpatrick as his candidate for Ambassador<br>
to the UN the media wondered why he would chose a Democrat.  When questioned<br>
as to how a Democrat could work for a Republican, she referred reporters to<br>
an article she had written for a conservative journal entitled "Why We Are<br>
Not Republicans".  I make mention of this not because of her apparent<br>
ability to mold herself to either party but rather to borrow a thought<br>
from the title:<br>
	Why are we not Catholics?<br>
	Why are we Protestants?<br>
<p>
While the excesses may (or may not) have disappeared, the basic theological<br>
differences remain (RC &lt;-&gt; Lutheran and CofE dialogs notwithstanding).<br>
We do well to refix in our minds the principals the Reformers fought for.<br>
I highly recommend the fat two-volume set on Reformation history by Wylie<br>
(available thru Great Christian Books) and the several books by D'Aubigne<br>
on the Reformation (Baker House, Grand Rapids).<br>
<p>
As an example of some of the incredible things we've learned:  I'm sure we<br>
all remember how God prepared Pharoah, Nebuchadnezzar, and Belshazzar to<br>
receive God's messenger.  Here's what happened to Frederick the Wise,<br>
Elector of Saxony:  The night before, he had a "continued story" series of<br>
three dreams.  In them a monk, writings on the door of Wittenburg's church,<br>
the Pope's tiara, a large pen reaching to Rome, and the Elector figured<br>
prominently.  On the morning of Oct 31, Frederick discussed his dreams with<br>
Duke George and it was recorded by Spalatin.  They concluded from their<br>
knowledge of Scripture (cf. Prov 29:2) that God had something significant<br>
in mind for Frederick.  The rest, as they say, is history.<br>
<p>
Oh, yes, in the dream, Frederick asked the monk whence came the large pen.<br>
The monk answered, "From a goose in Bohemia."  Bonus points if you know<br>
who the goose was and why the symbolism was apt.<br>

Yes, I'm quite concerned about supreme court appointments.  Packing the court<br>
with ultra-conservatives will invariable result in the lose of personal<br>
freedom.  Those with religious beliefs different from the "majority" will<br>
lose their constitutional right to believe and worship as they choose.<br>
<p>
I'm concerned about dirty politics and the apparent "no holds barred" approach<br>
the republicans exhibit in their political quest to win.<br>
<p>
I'm concerned about increased governmental control under Bill Clinton.  He<br>
wants to the government to control health care, child care, family issues,<br>
foreign trade, and the country's finances.<br>
<p>
I'm troubled with Ross Perot and his insatiable appetite for power.  He is<br>
a very powerful man and has many "grassroot" supporters who are wanting to<br>
climb the power tree on his coat tails.<br>
<p>
This election is a very difficult one for the average voter.  The mainstream<br>
American moderate that wants financial responsibility, personal freedom,<br>
less government, and equal rights for everyone has a real dilemma.  No<br>
party or candidate presents mainstream American moderates.<br>
<p>
The press has essentially declared that Bill Clinton will win by an electoral<br>
college landslide but a marginal popular vote.  Will Ross Perot win any<br>
electoral votes?  No, probably not.  Will a vote for Ross Perot be a vote for<br>
George Bush?  Yes, it just might be.<br>
<p>
If one decides based on the Vice Presidential candidate, it's a bit easier.<br>
Al Gore is clearly the most competent of the three.  But the VP is only a<br>
figure head in American government so this doesn't help much in the decision.<br>
<p>
Who am I voting for?  Probably Bill Clinton.  Not because I believe in his<br>
platform but because there are fewer "rotton planks" in his than the others,<br>
in my opinion.<br>

A recent posting discussed struggles with those who believe they have the<br>
"Right Answers".  I am not intending this as a response to the concerns<br>
expressed in the posting but rather as brief outline of my tho'ts on<br>
certainty and personality.<br>
<p>
I do not believe God would have us wallowing in uncertainty (cf. I Th 4:13).<br>
Rather we can learn truth (John 8:32) in greater and greater measure<br>
(2 Pet 3:18) culminating in heaven, albeit not on earth (Phil 3:13).<br>
Right answers for right living are found in Scripture (2 Tim 3:16).<br>
We *can* know how He wants us to live (Ps 199:105; Is 30:21; Prov 1:23).<br>
<p>
Great men and women of God have always been people of deep conviction<br>
(e.g., check out Wylie on Luther, Knox, Farel, Hus, Jerome, Wycliffe).<br>
They have not been spiritual or "moral castrates" (to borrow a phrase from<br>
William F Buckley).  They may have withstood some people to the face<br>
but before God they were humble and teachable (Matt 11:29; James 4:6;<br>
1 Pet 5:5).  [Btw, I find it is this, above all else, that distinguishes<br>
Godly PhDs from confused ones.]  I find this attitude critical to learning<br>
(2 Pet ch 1) so that you arrive at truth (John 16:13).<br>
<p>
Without humility, no matter how right our answers may be, we instantly<br>
create resistance on the hearer's part and do damage to God's reputation<br>
and message.<br>

<p>
I understand what you are saying about men --- very simple, no makeup etc.<br>
<p>
Whether we wear makeup or not -- whether a wedding ring or not --- really<br>
are minor issues. However, some church members make them major.  Just who<br>
was it that coined the expression, "majoring on minors?"!!!!<br>
<p>
I am also reminded that the General Conf. committee spent 3 days talking<br>
about the wedding ring!  Really now, is that necessary?? Are we being good<br>
stewards of our time???!!  &lt;&lt;smile!&gt;&gt;<br>

Has anyone heard much about what Adventist Contact has been doing recently?<br>
I know a few years ago I heard of some organizational problems, and that<br>
they were reorganizing.  Does anyone have any horror stories or success<br>
stories to share?<br>
<p>
What's to stop us from having such a computerized contact right here on<br>
SDA-L?   (Besides the obvious lack of anonymity)<br>
<p>
SWM, age 26, seeks.....<br>
<p>
(If people think this is a good idea, I will put out the rest of my blurb,<br>
at least.)<br>

Dave:<br>
<p>
You wrote<br>
----&gt;<br>
On our recent trip to Europe we witnessed to a considerable extent to<br>
two people, both of whom asked why we were vegetarians.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
I am interested to know what you said when asked why you are vegeterian.<br>
 <br>
So Dave ... why are you vegetarian?<br>
Does your vegetarian nature mean that you don't use animal products at all, or<br>
do you simply not eat meat?<br>
<p>
While I'm here, I'd also like to comment on the proposition that we are best<br>
served if our dress is simple and natural.<br>
<p>
I am inclined to agree here, although I wouldn't like to see that used as an<br>
argument to convince me not to wear my wedding ring. The kind of thing that<br>
really makes me laugh is people (mainly other men), typically church elders,<br>
who on the one hand make a strong verbal stand for the "simple and natural"<br>
thing - no makeup, no jewellery etc. etc., and at the same time won't let<br>
a visiting minister into the pulpit without a coat. (They themselves wouldn't<br>
be seen at church without a good suit.) The wearing of ties is also something<br>
which seems to be neither simple or natural!<br>

Dave,<br>
<p>
thanks for your response to my question.<br>
<p>
I have been an SDA all my life, and in my parents house we ate fish<br>
&amp; chicken occasionally, but most of the time we were vegetarian.<br>
<p>
For a while I lived in the nurses residence at a public hospital and<br>
my rent included meals at the cafeteria. This period lasted most of a year,<br>
and during this time I ate mostly whatever was served.<br>
<p>
Now I am married, and my wife is strictly vegetarian. Even if we weren't<br>
SDAs she still wouldn't eat meat. We both use eggs, dairy products and<br>
leather, and I eat some meat occasionally when I'm eating out.<br>
<p>
I would like to press you further on one phrase you used...you said<br>
you were a vegetarian for health and religious reasons. What do you mean<br>
when you say religious reasons? Do you mean to separate the two like that?<br>
Can you think of any moderate circumstances when you would eat meat?<br>
(I say moderate because I'm not after the stranded on desert island or<br>
lost at sea type circumstances!)<br>
<p>
I'm not trying to get picky with you, and I'm not about to turn around<br>
and try to rip you off over any response you might make, so please be<br>
honest - as you were with your previous answer!<br>
<p>
I get a bit edgy about the religious reasons thing, and I'm just interested<br>
to hear what you have to say.<br>
<p>
Tony<br>
<p>
P.S. Obviously this is an open discussion - just because I wrote "Dave"<br>
     at the beginning doesn't mean I will be upset if anyone else responds!<br>

<p>
Hmmm... I hate to say this, but yes, we should.  This is the United States,<br>
that guarantees individuals the right to free speech, and by extension, the<br>
freedom of personal expression.  Morals are by definition subjective in<br>
society as a whole.   Closed groups (like the set of SDA's, or the set of<br>
all Christians) may have what amounts to an objective set of standards for<br>
their circle, but outside their group, those morals may not be considered<br>
as being generally acceptable.<br>
<p>
Censorship in any form is contrary to the founding principles of this country.<br>
Standards of behavior should be enforced only when behavior infringes on the<br>
human rights of others.  When you try to set conservative societal standards,<br>
invariably, those standards get tighter and tighter, and more and more people<br>
get oppressed as a result.<br>
<p>
I often hear people expounding the virtues of Christian values, and how they<br>
should be the law of the land because "this is a Christian nation."  This is<br>
-not- a Christian nation.  This is a nation founded on the principle of <br>
freedom.  Freedom of speech. Freedom of religion. Freedom of the press. In<br>
the spirit of freedom, we have no right to force our concept of morality on<br>
others.  In return, we expect that they will not force their concept of it on us.<br>
Two Live Crew can make their "music".  Bob Guccione can publish his pornography.<br>
But we don't have to listen, don't have to look, don't have to buy.  Others may,<br>
and when they stand before their Maker, will face His judgement, just as will<br>
we all.  We should adhere to our Christian values, and teach them to our chilren.<br>
We should tell them to those who will listen, and ask them to join us.  But we<br>
can never make someone hold them by force.<br>

U R right Cheryl, the temple plan is not an easy thing to do. I only know<br>
of 2 churches that worked it for awhile.<br>
<p>
At present we have 4 churches particpating in our junior Academy. In mid<br>
summer I have a meeting with all perspective parents with guidlines for<br>
transportation -- church van-- etc. -- that is just for our church. Now,<br>
at the same time we include in the packet a form they can fill out<br>
requesting assistance from the church. We need a commitment from them how<br>
much they can contribute if only 10 or 20 dollars a month. I then take the<br>
requests to the church board. In 4 years we have never turned down a<br>
request! I believe this year our church portion that will be sent to the<br>
academy will be $3600.00 total -- not per month. The church believes every<br>
child should have an opportunity to go to Adventist school.<br>
<p>
The parents pay directly their portion to the school and our church<br>
treasurer does the same with the assistance. We of course alert the<br>
principal as to what the church will pay and for whom. We have members<br>
that contribute to a fund we call, "special projects." Our church also<br>
subsidizes the Academy. Our payment this year is in the neighborhood of<br>
$2000.00 a month. We live in sort of a depressed area where the main<br>
industry is "claming" and "crabing." -- Not much of an Oyster industry<br>
much any more. Some of the parents work in factories, or over at Annapolis<br>
for the state, such as secretaries, computer programmers etc. But most of<br>
the income of the members is small.<br>

--------&gt;<br>
I'd like those who are attending public institutions of higher education to<br>
respond......Wisconsin law requires that the university provide "reasonable <br>
accommodation of a student's sincerely held religious beliefs with regard <br>
to all examinations and other academic requirements."  (Chapter 36.43 of <br>
Wisconsin Law).  Along with the memo was a list of various religious holy <br>
days which may preclude students from attending class or examinations <br>
by religious affiliation........ <br>
<p>
Do other state universities have such a policy or law?  What degree of <br>
accomodation you required to make for student religious observance?  Are <br>
faculty and staff given the same liberties as students?......Cheryl<br>
--------&gt;<br>
<p>
In response, as another student from the University of Illinois in <br>
Champaign, I've dealt with this issue.  My cumulative exams were given <br>
once a month, Friday evenings @ 7PM.  The policy was to pass 6 exams <br>
(limit of 18 to be taken).  It one of the first concerns to be addressed when <br>
entering grad school, that is, to not have to take cumes on Sabbath. When I <br>
approached the professor in charge he sat back took a breath and then said <br>
" aaaah.. sure.... no problem" and proceeded to pull off the window (a sort <br>
of bulletin board) a similar statement which Cheryl described.  Special <br>
arrangements had to be made but it worked out well.  Interestingly, this <br>
same professor arranged ALL his exams for Sat. mornings.  It rather <br>
annoyed me, needless to say, but again the option for an early exam was <br>
given.<br>
<p>
I think my example has been consistent but on the otherhand I was rather <br>
embarrassed by an irresponsible undergrad who used his religious <br>
background not only to get out of taking his final exam on Saturday but <br>
leave campus early for X-mas break.  I say embarrassed because the TA in <br>
charge, a fellow lab mate, knew me well and knew the student had a <br>
legitimate reason so he asked me if I knew the student. (Rearranging final <br>
exams can be sticky and they were being careful.)  The TA proceeded to <br>
offer the exam just prior to Sabbath or after sundown that day to make <br>
accomodation.  Only then did the undergrad reveal that his plane to <br>
California was leaving Thursday sometime and he couldn't do that.  This <br>
didn't look good and both TA and undergrad fell into heated discussion of <br>
"responsibility and planning"  vs "religious rights".  Unfortunately, I don't <br>
think this was a positive witness.<br>
<p>
Just a few words from my experience.<br>

Currently in SDAnet we have 94 subscribers.  73 of these I know to be SDA,<br>
some I don't know either way.   15 of these 94 are female.  Only<br>
one that I know of has claimed to be African-American.  16 are employed<br>
by church institutions, mostly Andrews and La Sierra. <br>
Our country range now includes, besides the USA, Australia, Finland,<br>
and Iceland.  It has in the past also included England and Poland. <br>
Richard Guy reads our messages from Guam through a California computer,<br>
and Danny <br>
Kumamoto reads them in Japan.  Also we have one subscriber in Hong Kong.<br>
<p>
In addition to the SDA's reading this list, we also have LDS, Worldwide<br>
Church of God, Hebrew Pentecostal, and several other religions.<br>

I recall a long train ride home from Walla Walla College to Toronto<br>
by way of Chicago.  One woman in particular was very aggressively<br>
flirting with the men, sitting in whom ever's lap was empty and<br>
really carrying on the whole trip across the country.  A few hours<br>
before arrival time she put on her wedding ring and started flashing<br>
it in the faces of all those boy friends that she had collected.<br>
I happened to be right behind her getting off the train.  Her husband<br>
was there on the platform as the train slowed to a stop.  She made<br>
a flying leap into his arms from off the train and proceeded to carry<br>
on like the devoted trustable wife that she wanted him to think she was.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Furthermore Paul goes on to say that</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Many Sunday keeping Christians are resting fully in Christ for their</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;salvation; they are keeping Sunday for the right reason....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There can be no right reason for keeping Sunday at all, ..................</i><br>
<p>
oh? not even God Himself telling you Sunday was the day would make it<br>
right?<br>
<p>
  As a member of a church that believes in latter day prophets (I am one<br>
of the LDS Steve mentioned) I believe that Joseph Smith Jr (the first<br>
prophet of this, the last, dispensation) received a revelation from<br>
Jesus Christ himself stating that Sunday was the day appointed by Jesus<br>
to have our latter day Sabbath on (D&amp;C 59:10,12-13).<br>
  For those who chose to look this up, the key is that date on which the<br>
revelation was given Aug 7th, 1831 - a Sunday.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;....................................................... it is unscriptural</i><br>
<i>&gt;and those who keep it do it solely because of the traditions of men.</i><br>
<p>
  You seem to deny that there is even the slightest shadow of doubt<br>
about this in the NT, which there is.  While I grant that it isn't iron<br>
clad proof for a Sunday Sabbath, it is enough to make one question your<br>
assertion.<br>
  I don't remember exactly when your church says the great apostacy took<br>
place, but in the early AD 100s Justin Martyr wrote about the Christian<br>
keeping the day Sunday as the Sabbath.<br>

[SDA's don't deny that Sundaykeeping began as early as the mid 100's AD.<br>
As far as the New Testament itself is concerned, there is no doubt.  Some<br>
may have been generated in Scott's mind by reading the classic Mormon<br>
work "A Marvelous Work And A Wonder", in which LeGrand Richards makes <br>
outright lies in his interpretation of New Testament Greek.  Seventh-day<br>
Adventist also reject the notion that various periods called<br>
"dispensations" exist, or that God's Law or will change for different<br>
groups of people<br>
in different times.  Unlike the LDS, we require consistency between all <br>
prophetic messages.  SCT]<br>

Although this album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" is foul, disgusting, offensive, and opposed to every value we may hold dear, we live in a country of freedom<br>
of speech. Protecting unpopular speech by those on the fringe was one of <br>
the objectives of our country's founders. If Adventists expect their own<br>
views to be heard without censure, they should be very careful about<br>
attacking viewpoints as "illegal" speech they disagree with. This doesn't<br>
mean they can't disagree with the message and express it, however. <br>
<p>
Although some complain, the journalism profession is very agressive in<br>
their watchdog role. They aggressively protect freedom of speech. In<br>
fact, the press may be an Adventist's best friend when it comes to the<br>
right to speak regardless of the message. In the marketplace of free<br>
ideas, there will always be the untrue, the false, the offensive, the<br>
tasteless. That's the price we pay for freedom of speech. However, we<br>
(children included) do not have to buy, turn on the set, or listen. We<br>
have freedom of choice to turn it off. It's the same risk God gave us--<br>
freedom of choice.<br>
<p>
The marketplace of free ideas is one of the most wonderful opportunities<br>
for Adventists. Just observe what is happening with the message of<br>
Christian hope in the former Soviet Union. Freedom of the press and<br>
freedom of speech are two of the most precious possessions we have in<br>
the free world. We may not agree with many of the messages in our<br>
culture, but we should be willing to defend to the death anyone's right<br>
to speak, no matter how offensive the speech. Dan Rather (or his colleagues)<br>
may provide you the opportunity to speak your opinion someday when it is very <br>
critical that your message enter the marketplace of ideas.<br>

Allen Roy sent in a query recently asking how to reach Dr. William Shea.<br>
I assumed he was still with the Biblical Research Inst. and could be reached<br>
directly through the General Conference, but Allen said he had already <br>
tried that.  If anyone has an address how to contact Dr. Shea, please<br>
post it.  <br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>

I believe I've mentioned this before, but can't let the opportunity pass.<br>
My home town in California, Ukiah (2 hours north of SF), has run a<br>
temple plan school for over 30 years.  It is a 10 grade academy, running<br>
an enrollment of around 120 in the 10 grades.  No church member pays tuition,<br>
any child of a church member is free to go at no charge.  Non-church members<br>
may enroll, but they do pay tuition.  There is a large base of support<br>
in the church, especially now that there is an Adventist hospital in town.<br>
But when I was attending there (all 10 grades) there was no SDA hospital,<br>
and the church had only 300 members or so (they have more than 600 now).<br>
It takes a LOT of commitment on the part of the members, and you can't have<br>
some remove their support just because they disagree with the teachers now<br>
and again.  But given the right combination of members and a generous dose<br>
of the Holy Spirit, the temple plan will work!<br>

Hi, Greater SDA-L<br>
(which includes SDA-L members and all people who receive it's echo through<br>
SDAnet.)<br>
<p>
You notice that I'm titling the subject header of all things I send through<br>
SDA-L with SDA-L:, this way people can tell the difference easily as<br>
to what net the message went over and reply appropriately.<br>
<p>
Here is the directory of all members of both lists, as far as I know.<br>
If you want more information by your name, please E-mail me, or post to the<br>
list and let everyone know.<br>
<p>
SDA-L and SDAnet membership information as of Sep 1, 1992<br>
<p>
This information is for SDA-L and SDAnet members usage only.  Misuse will<br>
not be tolerated.<br>
<p>
By my count there are 127 working addresses in greater SDA-L right now, this<br>
includes the overlap of those people signed up to both SDA-L and SDAnet.<br>

I'm sorry, I can't believe that rebels are created by lists of rules.<br>
Agreed, lists of rules without foundation are not good, and I wish we<br>
would take a long look at revising them where-ever we find them (school,<br>
church, etc.), but they don't MAKE people rebel.  People CHOOSE to rebel.<br>
I went to SDA schools up through age 24, living on campus, eating at the<br>
caf, not wearing jeans, makeup, or jewelry, attening worships and handing<br>
in a worship card towards my quota, etc., yet I did not rebel.  I though<br>
(thought) a lot of the stuff was stupid, but I bent to it because that was<br>
where I wanted to be.  On some points I didn't go along, such as the<br>
fact that I was a frequent visitor at the little theater in St. Helena that<br>
showed wonderful revival films (Katheringe Hepburn, etc.).  Strictly off-<br>
limits, but unenforceable.  Yet, I am still active in the church, going<br>
to raise our children in the subculture to an extent, will probably home-<br>
school...    What makes the difference between me and those of my friends<br>
who did rebel, become substance abusers, have illegitimate children (and<br>
don't kid yourself that keeping them in the dorms tones down any of that!)?<br>
<p>
I believe it is due to a couple of things.  Parents, certainly.  My parents<br>
were always committed to the idea of establishing the concept and letting<br>
us make our own choices.  THEY did not lay down senseless rules, but helped<br>
us analyze the rules that were there to see why they were given.  Another<br>
point may be personality type -- I simply have always been the "go along,<br>
get along" type of person.  Stuff doesn't phase me to a great extent.<br>
Thirdly, commitment to God, to the church, reasons for being at college --<br>
perhaps my reasons were different than those of some of my more rebellious<br>
friends.<br>
<p>
Having said that, I do believe that senseless rules are unnecessary<br>
stumbling blocks for those of different personalities, parents, and<br>
commitment.  We should not do stuff that makes it easier for someone<br>
to choose rebellion over acceptance!  But people don't start taking<br>
drugs because of dress codes....  Something else is operating there, and<br>
perhaps we should exert some effort in the direction of finding out what<br>
that something else is.<br>

Did any of you study last weeks Sabbath school lesson in 1 Peter?  It<br>
hit two of these hot topics we've been discussing: women's role and<br>
jewelry.  It wasn't my week to teach, but I was interested in how it<br>
was handled by the head elder who was teaching.  He did very well,<br>
considering the nature of the topic.  In my personal study I use the<br>
commentary by Barclay and he always puts the passages into historical<br>
context, which helps me a great deal.  During the time Peter was writing<br>
women were essentially slaves, thus the advice to women to submit to<br>
their husbands came right after the same advice was given to slaves to<br>
submit to their masters!  Peter even starts out the section by saying<br>
"in the same way, women should submit...."   For a woman to become a<br>
Christian when her husband was not was extremely radical and would cause<br>
a lot of unpleasantness in the home -- she was not even to have opinions,<br>
much less act on them.  The jewelry issue was linked to the same cultural<br>
phenomenon:  after about the age of 14, women were seen as good only for<br>
men's bed partners.  They had lots of time on their hands and only one<br>
purpose in life: to be attractive to men.  Thus they spent an inordiante<br>
(oops, inordinate) amount of time and money to accomplish that purpose,<br>
by braiding, gilding, painting, dressing, adorning.  When Peter continued<br>
by telling the men that women were their equals in sharing God's grace,<br>
that too was EXTREMELY radical!  Women were not thought to be equals in<br>
any way at all, and this was an entirely new thought.  In some sense, the<br>
solution was for men to value their wives for more than the traditional<br>
purpose, then the women would perceive that they were worthwhile apart<br>
from their looks, and the adornment could then be less extreme.<br>
<p>
Typical of Adventism, we have formed some specific rules that we adhere<br>
to slavishly, while forgetting the overall concept that was behind the<br>
advice!  The same is true for Sabbath observance -- I hope  that the GC<br>
never bows to the pressure to establish guidelines for "proper" Sabbath-<br>
keeping, because then Sabbath will fall to the same level as the jewelry<br>
issue.<br>
<p>
This was an interesting lesson last week in another way too.  One of the<br>
university professors here in Morehead is very interested in the church.<br>
He is an organist and music professor and had been attending pretty<br>
regularly in the late spring.  Over the summer he had a job playing the<br>
organ for the Stephen Foster Story, and outdoor musical that runs all<br>
summer here in Kentucky.  (He has done it every summer for 20 years or so.)<br>
There are performances on Friday night and Sabbath afternoon.  Before he<br>
left for the summer he asked our pastor what he should do about that.  The<br>
pastor said that it was between him and God, and that God would help him<br>
work it out.  By the last month of the summer he asked for those times off<br>
and it was granted to him.  He was very pleased about this and so were we<br>
all when he told us.  I'm also pleased with our pastor's approach -- so<br>
\much better than coming down strong with a rule....  This man now has the<br>
concept of Sabbath observance that is motivated from the inside, not the<br>
outside.  He brought another professor with him this Sabbath, I believe<br>
it is someone he is dating, and she was wearing big gold earrings during<br>
our discussion on jewelry.  Of course, our head elder's wife was wearing<br>
a sapphire ring in addition to her wedding ring....  The elder spoke about<br>
this situation in his family and confessed that he opposed the sapphire ring,<br>
but didn't consider it a salvific issue, and thus would not lay down any<br>
law to his wife about what she could or could not wear.  She has Hodgkins<br>
disease and is undergoing chemotherapy and her hair is falling out, and I<br>
guess she feels better and more attractive with the ring, I don't know.<br>
<p>
Anyway, when the jewelry issue is seen in the light of "for what should<br>
men and women be valued?" it takes on an entirely different character.  We<br>
should not value each other for the amount of money we spend on our watches<br>
or cars or houses, or for the color or style of our hair, or for how much<br>
metal we can hang on our bodies -- not that owning or doing any of those<br>
things are inherently wrong, but that is not why we are valuable!<br>
<p>
I've gone on long enough.  I would be wearing my grandmother's gold wedding<br>
band, but I'm seven months pregnant and had to take it off while I still<br>
could!<br>

In a recent message, PHTH1@cc.newcastle.edu.au (Tony) asked<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am interested to know what you said when asked why you are vegeterian.</i><br>
<p>
I usually say, For health and religious reasons.  This time, an Indian<br>
fellow asked me, Which religion?  I said, Seventh-day Adventist.<br>
Later he asked me what Adventists believe.  So I told him we were<br>
Christians, Protestants, accepted the Old and New Testaments, accepted<br>
Christ as our Savior, and something about the Sabbath and the second<br>
coming; I can't remember exactly but that should give the general<br>
idea.  I also asked him about his beliefs or about Hinduism and we<br>
talked about that for a while.<br>
<p>
The other time, we were out to dinner with friends and someone asked<br>
my wife about our children's schooling and she said we were sending<br>
them to church school.  She asked which church, and my wife said<br>
Seventh-day Adventist.  It turns out her neighbor is an Adventist so<br>
we had a little discussion about that.<br>
<p>
Tony also asked<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So Dave ... why are you vegetarian?</i><br>
Does your vegetarian nature mean that you don't use animal products at all, or<br>
do you simply not eat meat?<br>
<p>
I am vegetarian for health and religious reasons.  :-)<br>
It's supported scientifically and also avoids causing suffering to animals.<br>
<p>
My eating habits (since you asked) have changed slowly over a long<br>
period.  When I became SDA someone mentioned about vegetarianism.  In<br>
a little while I dumped out my meat, that was that.  I still used<br>
milk, eggs, butter or margarine, and cheese.  Then a lady told me how<br>
good vegetable oils were, so I started pouring them on my toast<br>
instead of butter.  That at least got me off butter and margarine,<br>
which was a hard thing to do, since I used a lot of them.  Later I<br>
learned all those greasy vegetable oils weren't that good for you<br>
either.  (Especially in large quantities.)  After reading more EGW I<br>
dropped cheese.  But how can you have cereal without milk?  (I hadn't<br>
learned the habit of hot cereal.)  Later I started using hot cereal<br>
and putting pineapple and other fruit on it.  So, now my basic diet is<br>
total vegetarian, but when traveling we drink a lot of milk and use<br>
butter etc.  My family uses more milk than I do, and sometimes has<br>
pizza.<br>
<p>
It's interesting that our family traveled for a couple of weeks in<br>
Europe and had vegetarian food and only went to a restaurant once or<br>
twice.  We learned to buy stuff in the grocery store and eat in our<br>
motel rooms (without a kitchen).  It's a lot cheaper too.  In Europe<br>
they sell this milk that lasts for months without refrigeration, which<br>
helps.  You can go a long way on cereal and milk, nuts, fruit, bread,<br>
avocadoes, V-8 juice etc.  Even our children (ages 8, 11) didn't<br>
complain much.<br>

Although SDAs may not believe in "dispensations", they do accept the notion<br>
of "old covenant" and "new covenant".  The historical SDA interpretation of<br>
these eras is that God did chance something.  The most obvious is that the<br>
sacrificial system of the Jews which was a type of the Jesus' sacrifice on<br>
the cross, was no longer needed under the new covenant.  However, under the<br>
old covenant it is very clear that without shedding of blood there was no<br>
remission of sin for the Jews.  This was not a symbolic shedding of blood<br>
but quite literally animal sacrifices which were required to be "clean."<br>
Although some may argue that this doesn't change God's eternal law, it<br>
clearly DOES appear to be a different "dispensation."  The requirements for<br>
salvation were clearly different for people living before the cross and<br>
those after the cross.  This does reflect a change in God's dealings with<br>
man on this earth.<br>
<p>
SDAs view the 4th commandment quite literally (as opposed to being symbolic).<br>
SDAs believe that the 7th day has been the very same literal 7th day of each<br>
week since the beginning of time on this earth (and before the existence of<br>
this earth).  However, this very literal interpretation of God's law is not<br>
as defensible as you may think.  With all the "leap years", "leap minutes",<br>
and changes in the calendar historically, nobody can "prove" that the same<br>
7th day has been kept ALWAYS.  If God's law is viewed symbolically as to<br>
its meaning, keeping every 7th day IS keeping God's law.  SDAs have established<br>
an entire doctrine and interpretation of much of the Bible and prophecy on a<br>
very literal interpretation of the 4th commandment.  Yet there is no Biblical<br>
support for the idea that there is a very specific 7th day and only that day<br>
is acceptable to God.  If this were true, SDAs may be shocked to find out in<br>
the next life that they were "accidently" keeping the wrong 7th day.  For all<br>
we know, SDAs are keeping a "Tuesday" as Sabbath right now.<br>
<p>
I think study of scripture in the original Hebrew might be enlightening.  For<br>
example, does it say "the SEVENTH day is the Sabbath" or "THE seventh day is<br>
the sabbath?  In other words, is what does the original text use for the word<br>
"the" and what is its grammatical usage in this context?<br>

Although SDAs may not believe in "dispensations", they do accept the notion<br>
of "old covenant" and "new covenant".  The historical SDA interpretation of<br>
these eras is that God did chance something.  The most obvious is that the<br>
sacrificial system of the Jews which was a type of the Jesus' sacrifice on<br>
the cross, was no longer needed under the new covenant.  However, under the<br>
old covenant it is very clear that without shedding of blood there was no<br>
remission of sin for the Jews.  This was not a symbolic shedding of blood<br>
but quite literally animal sacrifices which were required to be "clean."<br>
Although some may argue that this doesn't change God's eternal law, it<br>
clearly DOES appear to be a different "dispensation."  The requirements for<br>
salvation were clearly different for people living before the cross and<br>
those after the cross.  This does reflect a change in God's dealings with<br>
man on this earth.<br>
<p>
SDAs view the 4th commandment quite literally (as opposed to being symbolic).<br>
SDAs believe that the 7th day has been the very same literal 7th day of each<br>
week since the beginning of time on this earth (and before the existence of<br>
this earth).  However, this very literal interpretation of God's law is not<br>
as defensible as you may think.  With all the "leap years", "leap minutes",<br>
and changes in the calendar historically, nobody can "prove" that the same<br>
7th day has been kept ALWAYS.  If God's law is viewed symbolically as to<br>
its meaning, keeping every 7th day IS keeping God's law.  SDAs have established<br>
an entire doctrine and interpretation of much of the Bible and prophecy on a<br>
very literal interpretation of the 4th commandment.  Yet there is no Biblical<br>
support for the idea that there is a very specific 7th day and only that day<br>
is acceptable to God.  If this were true, SDAs may be shocked to find out in<br>
the next life that they were "accidently" keeping the wrong 7th day.  For all<br>
we know, SDAs are keeping a "Tuesday" as Sabbath right now.<br>
<p>
I think study of scripture in the original Hebrew might be enlightening.  For<br>
example, does it say "the SEVENTH day is the Sabbath" or "THE seventh day is<br>
the sabbath?  In other words, is what does the original text use for the word<br>
"the" and what is its grammatical usage in this context?<br>

Just want to add some changes to the list.  Daniel Chuah, Ricky Lau and Foong Ha<br>
    Yap had returned to Hong Kong and have no access to electronic mail.  Millor<br>
    Tsui left Hong Kong for the US and does not yet have an address.  Thanks.<br>

In this album, Mark Heimermann joins Michael W. Smith as lead producer.<br>
That is the most defining characteristic of the album.  Heimermann has<br>
produced extensively, mostly the "Prism" series for kids and the recent<br>
Lisa Bevill album.  The kids he's been producing for are growing up<br>
and this album is an obvious target to catch them as teenagers.  Also,<br>
Heimermann has a long association with Smith, having toured with him<br>
several times.<br>
<p>
The writers on this album have been previously mentioned here.  Diane <br>
Warren, who writes for Kathy Troccoli as well as a lot of more famous people,<br>
contributes a set of lyrics, as does Toby McKeehan (DC Talk).  Amy Grant<br>
co-wrote a couple songs and sings a duet on "Somewhere, Somehow"<br>
<p>
The sounds of this album are a Michael W. we've never heard before and<br>
hopefully will never hear again.  The strong keyboard lines and<br>
traditional harmonies that mark his music are a thing of the past.  The<br>
best song on <br>
the album is the re-make of "Friends" but this is marked by all-male backing<br>
vocals by the people who are his band and musicians on both of his albums<br>
(Harris, Rodriguez, Kirkpatrick)<br>
<p>
The words are stimulating as usual, "Give It Away", "Cross of Gold"<br>
and "Color Blind" providing most of the fireworks here.  But even so <br>
the God-and-Jesus meter is turned down a couple of notches.<br>
<p>
This is teeny-bopper music, not baby boomer music.  If you liked Lisa <br>
Bevill's album you will like this one, too.  The main difference between<br>
this and Lisa Bevill is that she can sing and M. W. Smith can't.  This<br>
is Smith's worst album since "The Live Set."  But on a bad day he's better<br>
than most people at their best, and although it's not a great album,<br>
it will provide much listening enjoyment for a long time to come.<br>
<p>

Some of you may be able to relate to my situation.  If you can,<br>
I'd appreciate your thoughts.  <br>
<p>
I teach mathematics at a state university.  Out of about 11,000<br>
students, perhaps 25 are SDA's ranging in age from 18 to 45.  They<br>
are single, married, undergraduates, grad students, full-time,<br>
part-time, comfortable, poor, desperate, sick, and healthy.  What they<br>
are NOT is seen, appreciated, noticed, significant, etc. as far as<br>
the church is concerned.  Why is it that otherwise normal people<br>
are so totally incapable of manifesting any interest in SDA<br>
students living in their own town going to a state school?  All the<br>
theology in the world can't explain that away.  Our adult members<br>
are numb inspite of what they think of themselves.  This is also<br>
true with regard to the conference "leaders" who make this town<br>
home.  How do we get our members and "leaders" off their comfortable<br>
backsides with regard to this problem?<br>

OK, so three posts in one session is a bit excessive, but I have a <br>
question to ask the net. I have had discussions about this with friends<br>
and so on at my church, but I'm interested in a wider perspective.<br>
<p>
SDAs have always made a point of defending their sunset-to-sunset every<br>
week. This has often been the cause of much hardship, as illustrated<br>
by countless stories of people losing jobs/failing courses/losing<br>
friends and so on. Usually the stories we read or hear have a happy<br>
ending, but let's face it, many real life ones don't.<br>
<p>
I am the head sound engineer for my church of 1500 weekly attenders.<br>
Our regular pattern is to have quite a varied presentation at 11am<br>
each Saturday, consisting of special music, a children's story, sometimes<br>
a small drama segment, and so on. Our Friday night vespers programs<br>
often involve concerts, audio-visual presentations and other interesting<br>
things.<br>
<p>
The job of technical production of these events falls to those few of us<br>
with the skills and experience necessary to handle the job. Even in a<br>
church of 1500 there are not too many people capable of taking the <br>
responsibility of a senior elder or deacon, and coordinating the team<br>
effort required to ensure that the programs "work". As far as sound<br>
production goes, we have a few people who are able to handle basic programs,<br>
but as soon as things become at all complex the job falls to the two or<br>
three who are more experienced.<br>
<p>
During times such as the beginning of the school year, and sometimes around<br>
Easter and Christmas, complex programs are the norm and I am often working<br>
three weekends out of four. My typical weekend program might go something<br>
like this:<br>
<p>
Friday arvo        set up for vespers<br>
Friday night      6:30pm spm sound check + operate for vespers<br>
Saturday          8:45am-12:30pm set up + sound check + operate for church<br>
                  (could go later if the preacher is over-enthusiastic)<br>
<p>
If there is an afternoon program I may have to handle it as well, but would<br>
usually delegate wherever possible.<br>
<p>
Operating a complex sound system for a variety-type program in a building<br>
this size takes concentration and organization. When I am working I almost<br>
always miss the lesson discussion groups because I am setting up gear for<br>
a choir or a drama, or someone wants to practice something. Sure, I do<br>
hear the sermon.<br>
<p>
So here's my question.<br>
<p>
Someone at uni wants me to do something on Saturday. Maybe it's help out<br>
with a public demonstration. Maybe it's just a social activity. I say,<br>
"thanks, but my Saturday's are booked to God, and besides, I don't want<br>
to miss church" or whatever. Perhaps then they ask me to explain about<br>
the Sabbath. My explanation would probably include "holy day", "worship",<br>
and "no work" if I am a typical SDA.<br>
<p>
The only problem is, I do often work on Saturday, and I do often miss many<br>
of the aspects of public worship. How can this contradiction be resolved?<br>
SDAs seem to be quite happy about work on Sabbath, so long as it is<br>
medical-related and/or unpaid.<br>
<p>
I have lots more to say on this issue, but this will do for now. Looking<br>
forward to hearing from you all soon!<br>
<p>

Network,<br>
Lola, <br>
<p>
Glad the temple plan is working. I think I pastored one of the last<br>
churches in Mich. that used the Temple Plan. That was the Grand Ledge<br>
church. I pastored there for 8 years and I could see the problems<br>
increasing year by year. Some parents with 2 or 3 children were paying<br>
$5.00 a month or none at all into church expense. What we finally did was<br>
get a commitment from the parents of what they could give each month and<br>
then we got sponsors from the church to make up the difference.<br>
<p>
Before we did that 90% of our church budget was going to the school. When<br>
we needed to make repairs to church and even just routine mainatenance we<br>
couldn't do it because so much of the budget was going to the academy<br>
across the street.<br>

<p>
Dave, I read your email with interest --- vegetarianism etc. -- It<br>
reminded me in times past of different things I have tried on my cereal.<br>
At present most of the time we use milk with 1% fat. But, I have tried,<br>
Apple Juice, Orange juice, Cashew milk, Home made soy milk!<br>
<p>
I too, have cut my consumption of cheese down where I eat it only<br>
occasionally. Once in a while I'll fix myself an egg sandwich but 99% of<br>
the time we use egg beaters.<br>
<p>
My reason for the vegetarian life style at this point is because I am<br>
attempting to keep my fat intake to 15 or less grams of fat a day. Also I<br>
eat so called "health foods" -- analogs -- or whatever you choose to call<br>
them, very sparingly. Fruits, fresh whenever I can get them, I really<br>
enjoy as well as steamed vegetables.<br>
<p>

Bill Shea is one of my church members and you would probably get a quicker<br>
response if you contact him at his home address or phone, it is as<br>
follows:<br>

If you would rather contact his office -- its just General Conf of SDA,<br>
12501 Old Columbia, Pke, Silver Spring, MD. Do not have zip handy but it<br>
is just the general address for GC which can be found in most periodials<br>
of the church.<br>

Network: To Bob M.<br>
<p>
It is interesting to read some accounts of American history where it would<br>
appear to be very evident that America was more of a Christian nation<br>
then some like to admit. <br>
<p>
I am sure probably we all know on the network that originally for instance<br>
and example, there were church related, church sponsored colleges and<br>
universities. And as follows:<br>
<p>
Harvard (1636)<br>
Yale (1701)<br>
Princeton (1746)<br>
University of King's College (1789)<br>
Rutgers (1766)<br>
<p>
It was very interesting to me to discover the following statement from<br>
the charter of King's College and this was used as an advertisement in<br>
New York newspapers:<br>
<p>
"The chief thing to be arrived at in this college is to teach and engage<br>
young people to love and know God in Christ Jesus and to love and serve<br>
Him with all sobriety, godliness and richness of life, with a pure heart<br>
and willing mind."<br>
<p>
Of course higher education cannot make this statement today!<br>

Paul Gates enquires: <br>
<i>&gt; Drew, RU saying that you do not celebrate Easter or Christmas? Those are</i><br>
<i>&gt; the 2 most High Sabbaths in the churches that I pastor.</i><br>
<p>
Yes. Rather than observe Easter we observe the Christian Passover on the <br>
evening of the 14th of Nisan, and follow it with the 7 days of the Feast<br>
of Unleavened Bread. Prior to this time we deleaven our homes, and then<br>
during the Days of Unleavened Bread when we eat bread, we make sure it is<br>
unleavened. The first and last days of the Days of Unleavened Bread are<br>
annual Sabbaths (15th and 21st of Nisan) during which we have morning and<br>
afternoon Church services.<br>
<p>
We do not celebrate Christmas because to our way of thinking it is a<br>
compromise with paganism. It is not known when Jesus was born, but the<br>
available evidence indicates anything but December. If God had wanted us<br>
to remember the date of Jesus' birth we believe he would have been explicit<br>
about it - even as he has been about his Sabbaths.<br>
<p>
The lessons we rehearse from the annual Sabbaths and Festivals are these:<br>
<p>
 14 Nisan - Passover - Death of Jesus as sacrifice for all mankind's sins,<br>
    reconfirming our baptismal covenants with God, drinking wine and eating<br>
    unleavened bread as reminders of Jesus' broken body and shed blood,<br>
    foot washing as reminder of Jesus' example of service and that we should<br>
    do likewise.<br>
<p>
 15 Nisan - 21 Nisan - 7 Days of Unleavened Bread - The need for us to<br>
    come out of sin even as Israel came out of Egypt.<br>
<p>
 50 days after the weekly Sabbath that falls during the Days of Unleavened<br>
    Bread - Pentecost, or the Feast of Firstfruits - reminder that God<br>
    traditionally gave 10 Commandments on this day and historically poured<br>
    out his spirit in AD 31. With his spirit, Christ lives in us and we<br>
    can develop godly character and nature.<br>
<p>
  1 Tishri - Feast of Trumpets - teaches Jesus return as King of kings,<br>
    a time of war when nations fight Christ, beginning of regathering of<br>
    Israel.<br>
<p>
 10 Tishri - Day of Atonement - teaches that finally world will be at<br>
    peace and at-one-ment with God and Christ, reminds us again of Jesus<br>
    sacrifice which was penalty paid to remove the sin which separates<br>
    man from God and prevents at-one-ment with him today. Also reminds<br>
    us that Satan will be bound 1,000 years and unable to deceive the <br>
    nations.<br>
<p>
 15-20 Tishri - Feast of Tabernacles - teaches us of the wonderful utopian<br>
    conditions that world will experience for 1,000 years under rule of<br>
    Christ from Jerusalem. Law will go forth from Zion and nations will<br>
    not learn war anymore.<br>
<p>
 21 Tishri - Last Great Day - teaches us that following the millenium and<br>
    the brief release of Satan at its close, God will resurrect all those<br>
    who have lived and died not being called, and these will experience a<br>
    period of time to learn of God's way and be called. At the end of this<br>
    period of time (which we believe will last 100 years) any who are<br>
    rebellious and unrepentant will be destroyed in the lake of fire.<br>
    The heavens and the earth will be made new and God the Father will come<br>
    down from heaven with New Jerusalem to establish the earth as "head-<br>
    quarters" of the universe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Our membership looks foward to these special Sabbaths all year long.</i><br>
<p>
Our membership looks forward to these Festivals all year long too. They are<br>
the highlight of our lives. Indeed, we count our years in terms of Passover<br>
to Passover or Feast (of Tabernacles) to Feast. The Feast of Tabernacles is<br>
especially meaningful to us as throughout the year we save a second tithe<br>
and then use this to travel to one of a number of designated Feast sites<br>
where for 8 days (FoT + LGD) we worship God and fellowship with our brethren.<br>
Christmas doesn't even come close to this experience :-).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We still use the names of the days of the week and shake hands although</i><br>
<i>&gt; these too came from Paganism. (smile)</i><br>
<p>
I expect that in the millenium the days of the week will be renamed :-)<br>
<p>
  "For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all <br>
   call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent." (Zep 3:9)<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
<p>

In various religious liberty articles people try to make the point that<br>
the U.S. is not a Christian nation.  But in fact we are a Christian nation.<br>
The Supreme Court, in a decision in the 1880's which has never been <br>
overturned, _Holy Trinity_, ruled that "The United States is a Christian <br>
nation."  It was this decision together with the Sunday legislation that <br>
 was being considered in Congress at that time that catapulted A.T. Jones<br>
to the forefront of Adventism as a champion of religious liberty.<br>
<p>
We must be careful in the pursual of separation of church and state to <br>
make sure that we do not appear to be antireligious.  A lot of moral<br>
standards which seem to be the province of Adventism alone once were the <br>
values of the whole country.  As Richard Mullins said "I do not know <br>
that we can have a heaven here on earth, but I am convinced we need <br>
not have a hell."<br>

<i>&gt;oh? not even God Himself telling you Sunday was the day would make it</i><br>
<i>&gt;right?</i><br>
<p>
I agree with you that God has the right to change whatever He chooses, but<br>
wht would He change His Memorial of creation?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  As a member of a church that believes in latter day prophets (I am one</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the LDS Steve mentioned) I believe that Joseph Smith Jr (the first</i><br>
<i>&gt;prophet of this, the last, dispensation) received a revelation from</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jesus Christ himself stating that Sunday was the day appointed by Jesus</i><br>
<i>&gt;to have our latter day Sabbath on (D&amp;C 59:10,12-13).</i><br>
<i>&gt;  For those who chose to look this up, the key is that date on which the</i><br>
<i>&gt;revelation was given Aug 7th, 1831 - a Sunday.</i><br>
<p>
I have studied some of the LDS works and the greatest problem I have is with<br>
Peter showing up to J. Smith and this "Jesus' appointed day of Sunday" claim.<br>
Do you think that maybe He made a mistake in appointing Saturday as the<br>
original sabbath in the first place?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I don't remember exactly when your church says the great apostacy took</i><br>
<i>&gt;place, but in the early AD 100s Justin Martyr wrote about the Christian</i><br>
<i>&gt;keeping the day Sunday as the Sabbath.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Cardinal Gibbons makes no bones about the change being by Catholic ordination!<br>

To the Network:<br>
<p>
Steve, I would like revisit the reason for my statements on the Sabbath<br>
since I believe everyone on the network that responded to me were<br>
misunderstanding my message.<br>
<p>
Let me back up and give some background ----<br>
<p>
The good news of salvation, realized in the holy history of Jesus Christ,<br>
is often described in the New Testament by the word, REST (Matt 11:28;<br>
Heb. 4:2,3) Since the Fall, this promised rest in Christ has been linked<br>
with the Sabbath. For this reason the major feast days in the Old<br>
Testament, pointing to the Messiah and His redemptive activities, were<br>
designated "a Sabbath day of rest." The Sabbath therefore, is more than a<br>
day of physical and mental rest but has definitely a redemptive<br>
significance and is a vital part of the new covenant. Hence, recovering<br>
and restoring the full gospel, necessitates the recovery and the<br>
restoration of the Sabbath doctrine. So where I am coming from is  trying<br>
to share that the Sabbath rest is related to the gospel and the doctrine<br>
of righteousness by faith.<br>
<p>
Probably I really should back up to the expression, "In Christ" and<br>
elaborate on that expression but will do that later.<br>
<p>
My first point is:<br>
<p>
1. THE SABBATH IS GOD'S REST DAY<br>
While the Sabbath was made for man (Mark 2:27), it does not belong to man<br>
but God: For proof texts please cite: <br>
	Ex. 20:10 "The Seventh day is the Sabb. of the Lord thy God."<br>
	Ex. 31:13 "My Sabbaths ye shall keep."<br>
	Isa. 58:13 "My holy day....the holy of the Lord"<br>
<p>
God created this world in six days and rested on the seventh day. Man was<br>
created at the end of the sixth day and therefore God's Sabbath was really<br>
his first whole day. ( Gen. 1:26-2:3)<br>
<p>
God first worked and rested, the pattern for man was the very opposite;<br>
Adam and Eve did not begin by working, but resting in God's finished work<br>
and then followed it by six days of work. This distinction is very<br>
important when Sabbath is applied to the gospel. God's seventh day is our<br>
Saturday ( Juke 23:54-56, T.E.V.)<br>
<p>
The reason God rested the seventh day was not because He was tired or<br>
needed a break but because His work was PERFECT AND FINISHED.<br>
<p>
Both creation as well as redemption were accomplished through Christ.<br>
Further, both were finished on the sixth day and in each case Christ<br>
rested on the seventh day from all His work.<br>
<p>
Creation: Jn. 1:3;Eph. 3:9;Col. 1:16; Rev. 3:14.<br>
Redemption: Rom. 3:24; 1Cor. 1:30;Gal. 3:13; Col 1:14; Titus 2:14; Heb.<br>
9:12; 1Pet. 1:18.<br>
<p>
Therefore Christ could rightfully claim to be "Lord also of the Sabbath."<br>
Mk 2:28; Luke 6:5.<br>
<p>
God's Sabbath was made for man is my next point but I will comment on that<br>
next time.<br>
<p>
To some on the network, what I am saying is foreign and "untried." But<br>
the Sabbath must be judged by the gospel.<br>
<p>

I noticed that I posted a review of a Michael W. Smith album to SDAnet<br>
instead of to rec.music.christian.  I haven't discussed Contemporary <br>
Christian Music much here or with the youth groups I have worked with <br>
mainly because up till now it's been a non-starter.  The groups I have <br>
worked with just haven't been interested.<br>
<p>
Now it's a different ball game.  The youth in Pittsburgh have already <br>
organized themselves into an ensemble that has already played a significant<br>
role in our worship services here, and is poised to greatly expand its role.<br>
Our pastor would like a no-holds-barred celebration service, in this he <br>
is stalled by a conservative music committee, and church board.<br>
<p>
I'm planning to help them get organized, and hopefully raise whatever<br>
style of music we play to a higher performance quality.  Any suggestions<br>
from the<br>
net would be helpful, and I will share what I know over the course <br>
of the next few months.<br>

Since jewelry/wedding band is under discussion right now, I'm curious on the<br>
net reaction to a story I heard yesterday (true story, friend of mine <br>
experienced it).<br>
<p>
A young mother works for the bookstore on the SDA university campus.  She does <br>
not wear a wedding band by her own choice.  She is happily married with a 6 <br>
month old child.  The manager of the store asked her to wear a wedding band.<br>
He cites the reason that there are many single university students coming <br>
through the store, and it's nicer for them to know from the beginning who was<br>
single and who wasn't!!!  She actually thinks the reason is that she looks very<br>
young and has a small child, and he doesn't was it to look bad (like she's a <br>
young single mother).<br>
<p>
I've heard plenty of stories where people were asked to take wedding bands off<br>
my SDA administrators, but I've never heard one where they were asked to wear <br>
them!<br>
<p>
What do you think??<br>

Yes, I also liked it.  I only wished she had timed it right - before <br>
we went to our Sabbath school classes and not after.  I also had a few<br>
comments which would have been relevant if they were before the Sabbath.<br>
<p>
Do people on the net think that maybe, on Wednesdays and Thursdays we<br>
could share insights on the lesson for the approaching Sabbaths?  Particularly<br>
those among us who teach classes?<br>

  My reaction, as LDS and a former Lutheran, is YOU NEED A SOUND<br>
ENGINEER FOR CHURCH SERVICES?  This bogles my mind.  And I thought the<br>
Catholics over did it.  Is this 'standard' in the SDA church?<br>
<p>
[With the larger churches of 1000 or more, it certainly is.  At Shadyside<br>
in Pittsburgh, we don't really have a real sound engineer, and it shows.<br>
Just with any auditorium that big, you should have one.  In smaller churches<br>
working the PA is handled by the deacons, and is usually only a<br>
part-time job.   SCT]<br>

<i>&gt;I agree with you that God has the right to change whatever He chooses, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;wht would He change His Memorial of creation?</i><br>
<p>
  To a memorial of the atonement, a rememberance of Christ's<br>
resurrection.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I have studied some of the LDS works and the greatest problem I have is with</i><br>
<i>&gt;Peter showing up to J. Smith and this "Jesus' appointed day of Sunday" claim.</i><br>
<p>
  Really?  Not with polygyny or eternal marriage, or the Father having a<br>
body, or baptism for the dead, or the apostles John and the 3 Nephites<br>
being alive and on earth to this day, or Christ in America after leaving<br>
the apostles to ascend to heaven?<br>
<p>
  There are precedence in the Bible for a dead prophet coming to a<br>
living person (Moses and Elias coming to Jesus on mount).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Do you think that maybe He made a mistake in appointing Saturday as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;original sabbath in the first place?</i><br>
<p>
  No mistake with the original 7th day sabbath.  It was a rememberance<br>
of the completion of creation.  Then of the deliverance of Israel from<br>
Eypgt.  Now we have the 1st day sabbath in rememberance of the<br>
completion of the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;  I don't remember exactly when your church says the great apostacy took</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;place, but in the early AD 100s Justin Martyr wrote about the Christian</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;keeping the day Sunday as the Sabbath.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Cardinal Gibbons makes no bones about the change being by Catholic ordination!</i><br>
<p>
  So, the catholics have been known to be wrong before.  :) Actually,<br>
since they claim apostlic succession then, they are 'sort of' correct<br>
(the apostles did make the change.  See my remarks about Steve's<br>
addition to my last note where I mention the Epistle to the Magnesians,<br>
written 101 AD).<br>

Hi, Stever,<br>
<p>
I liked your review of the latest MWS album. I'm going to get it<br>
in the next few weeks.<br>
<p>
Anyway, back home we had a little row over music and appropriateness.<br>
Brett Barry made a weekend swing through the Chicago area a couple<br>
of weekends ago. He made a stop at North Shore for a Saturday evening<br>
concert at 6 PM. For you sticklers to details, that did put the<br>
performance at the tail end of the Sabbath. Not only that, the youth<br>
leader insisted that the concert be held in the sanctuary for<br>
acoustic reasons. The church gym's acoustics, for the lack of a<br>
better word, stink and the sanctuary's A/V equipment has been updated<br>
over the last five years.<br>
<p>
The leader also took the initiative to invite an opening act, a local<br>
Christian rock group, to perform before Barry. This whole issue<br>
was taken before the church board for approval. I, and a number of<br>
others, didn't mind having Barry there. He had agreed to keep his<br>
musical set in harmony with the Sabbath, but we couldn't get assurances<br>
that the opening act would. Also, the board feared a backlash from<br>
the more conservative members complaining that anything resembing<br>
CCM doesn't belong in the sanctuary. Period. You know, the types who<br>
cringe when a singer uses recorded backing music for special music.<br>
<p>
I really wanted to have both of them in there, esp the opening act.<br>
If we really want to give our support for our local musicians, no<br>
matter what your persuasion, you need to give them some kind of<br>
platform to be noticed. The board ended up allowing Barry to perform<br>
w/o an opening act. The review is forthcoming in the next church<br>
newsletter. I haven't even seen the review yet.<br>
<p>
I've got other comments on music and appropriateness, but I'll save<br>
it for another time. Hope I didn't scare you, Steve.<br>

Paul Writes:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is interesting to read some accounts of American history where it would</i><br>
<i>&gt; appear to be very evident that America was more of a Christian nation</i><br>
<i>&gt; then some like to admit. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am sure probably we all know on the network that originally for instance</i><br>
<i>&gt; and example, there were church related, church sponsored colleges and</i><br>
<i>&gt; universities. And as follows:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Harvard (1636)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yale (1701)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Princeton (1746)</i><br>
<i>&gt; University of King's College (1789)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rutgers (1766)</i><br>
<p>
There is a difference, Paul, between a being a nation that allows Christian<br>
belief and teaching, and a "Christian Nation."  For the United States to be<br>
offically a Christian Nation would be, in effect, to say that if one is a<br>
Jew, Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Atheist, or a member of any other non-Christian<br>
faith, then one is not an American.  To do this would, I believe, be a <br>
chilling first step towards being declared a "Sunday worshipping Christian<br>
Nation", or a "Papal following Christian Nation."    <br>
<p>
God gave us the freedom to choose to follow Him, or not.  Billions of people<br>
believe they -are- following Him, and there are many paths that these billions<br>
follow, each convinced their way is the right one.  We need to show them why<br>
we feel the way we walk is the proper path, and allow them to choose it if they<br>
will.  We cannot force them to follow it through governmental decree.  That is<br>
not God's way.  Christ asks for our love, Satan demands our fealty.  If we work<br>
to force people to be Christian by making this a Christian Nation, we are not<br>
working for the Lord at all. <br>
<p>
-Bob<br>

Here goes the SDANet libertarian again.... :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I've heard plenty of stories where people were asked to take wedding bands off</i><br>
<i>&gt;my SDA administrators, but I've never heard one where they were asked to wear </i><br>
<i>&gt;them!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;What do you think??</i><br>
<p>
Progressives:  We wanna wear wedding bands!<br>
<p>
Conservatives: Landmarks, landmarks....<br>
<p>
Progressives:  Times have changed!<br>
<p>
Conservatives: Landmarks, landmarks, keep separate from the world...<br>
<p>
Progressives:  Obsolete!  Inconsistencies!<br>
<p>
Conservatives: Inertia...  Fixed landmarks...  Pillars of the church...<br>
<p>
Progressives:  Personal choice!  Differences in culture!<br>
<p>
Conservatives: OK, fine.   We won't take any position.<br>
<p>
&lt;time passes&gt;<br>
<p>
Conservatives: Appearances!  Consistency!<br>
<p>
Progressives:  Huh???  We *have* to wear wedding bands???!!<br>
<p>
Oh well....<br>

Network, Steve,<br>
<p>
Fred Christiansen pointed out to me probably a typographical error in what<br>
I said about the right reason for worshipping Sabbath. What I intended was<br>
keeping Sabb in the true spirit like Salvation by Faith in God's Grace.<br>
Wrong way would be keeping it for works.  Just wanted to make that clear.<br>

<p>
This is an instance of the broad topic of suffering, esp. for doing right.<br>
There are some verses which are relevant to this (e.g., I Pet 2:15,19, 3:17,<br>
4:19; all the texts in Rev. re those who endure with patience).  None of<br>
them suggest that one has an out if the going gets tough.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The only problem is, I do often work on Saturday, and I do often miss many</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the aspects of public worship. How can this contradiction be resolved?</i><br>
<i>&gt; SDAs seem to be quite happy about work on Sabbath, so long as it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; medical-related and/or unpaid.</i><br>
<p>
May I suggest that the elaborateness of the preparations necessary for<br>
such type of services might encourage one to reconsider whether making a<br>
real production out of things is in harmony with Sabbath keeping.<br>
<p>
By the way, while Sabbath is comparatively restful for most folk, it's<br>
incredibly busy for pastors.  Is their work wrong on the Sabbath?<br>
(Hint:  There's a verse in Scripture addressing this specifically.  Extra<br>
bonus points to the finder.) Those who help with the church services<br>
would be in the same boat, I reckon.<br>
<p>
As for the medical work:  The basis is that Christ healed on the Sabbath.<br>
Therefore, any medically-related work is OK, right?  I would suggest a careful<br>
reading of EGW's counsel on Sabbath keeping at our health institutions.<br>
The index is a good place to start research.<br>

<p>
Depends what constitutes proof. I was curious about this issue once, and was<br>
sure that through the ages some discrepancy had occurred. Thus I proceeded to<br>
calculate the days and dates back into history, rather a non-trivial task as<br>
it turned out. There are other calendars and historic records which can be<br>
compared to get a triangulation on a particular day if the same event is<br>
recorded in both histories. (no, I didn't do all this research myself, but<br>
the calculations were exact and meticulous - based on verifiable research).<br>
It is a rather complex matter because from 10 to 15 calendar dates (depending<br>
on when the change from Julian to Gregorian calendar took place in different<br>
countries) were deleted from the calendar.<br>
<p>
The results showed conclusively that the day we call Saturday is in fact the<br>
same Sabbath that Judaic people kept before the time that Jesus walked this<br>
earth. If it can be shown that the weekly Sabbath was kept without changing<br>
days during the entire Old Testament period, then we can be sure that it is<br>
indeed the same Sabbath today.<br>
<p>
Of course whether sabbath is to be interpreted literally or symbolically is a<br>
different matter altogether.<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
I posted what I did to try to stimulate some thinking.  (I get tired of the<br>
memorized standard replies posted without thought.)  To give you a good<br>
example of what I was trying to convey (which appears to have been misunderstood), try this one.<br>
<p>
SDAs believe in the law of tithing.  Although tithing has not been a test of<br>
membership in general, it certainly has been used for purposes of selecting<br>
church leaders and employees.  Well, the tithing system set up for Israel<br>
required that the FIRST fruits be given as tithe.  Not the 2nd or 3rd tenths.<br>
Yet, I have never heard an SDA vehemently argue that your tithing was not<br>
acceptable to God unless it was the VERY FIRST CHECK you wrote after getting<br>
your paycheck (First fruits).  How many SDA belief their tithe is acceptable<br>
if paid AFTER the rent or mortgage but before anything else?  Is that the<br>
FIRST fruits?  No!!!  Is it acceptable to God?  Absolutely!  Why?  Because<br>
the spirit of the law of tithing is to give 10% to God.  Yet SDAs do this<br>
literal thing on the 7th day Sabbath.  Is worship on the first day of the<br>
week acceptable?  Absolutely!  How about the 2nd, 3rd, 4th..etc.  Absolutely!<br>
I think God would be thrilled if we became devout enough in our submission<br>
and worshipped EVERY DAY of the week!  Does it break God's law to worship<br>
on the First day of the week if you also kept the 7th?  No!  This is why I<br>
cannot understand the idea that my entire Salvation rests on whether I keep<br>
the "right" day of the week!  I don't believe God is that dogmatic or<br>
arbitrary (I know, using arbitrary will bring a flood of EGW quotes from the<br>
Great Controversy).  But I use it here to make a point.  Is God arbitrary<br>
about anything in the plan of salvation?  Yes, Jesus was the only one to<br>
live a perfect life and worthy to offer as an atonement.  But if there had<br>
been a second being, did it have to be Jesus?  Would only Jesus' blood have<br>
paid the debt?<br>
<p>
I also don't understand how SDAs can claim that pre-cross and post-cross<br>
requirements for salvation were NOT different.  What would have happened<br>
to an Israelite if he said his family wasn't going to offer animal sacrifices<br>
because they believed the Jesus future blood would be sufficient?  Would he<br>
and his family been allowed to stay in the encampment?  No!  The sacrifice<br>
was REQUIRED and NECESSARY.  Without spilling of animal blood, there was<br>
no atonement for sin before the cross.  Whether the cross was the fulfillment<br>
of a covenant that could not be kept by pre-cross Israel is immaterial.  There<br>
are clearly two different "dispensations."  SDAs quickly agree that the Law of<br>
Moses "was nailed to the cross."  Was the Law of Moses given of God?  Yes!<br>
Was it God's Law then?  Yes, to Israel it was the requirements of God.  Did<br>
God change or overturn His own law?  Absolutely!  I'm not buying a lamb and<br>
slaughtering it every time I need to repent and ask for forgiveness!  So does<br>
God change His laws?  Yes, we have clear evidence that He did for Israel.  Could<br>
God change His law(s) now or in the future?  Yes.  I have frequently heard<br>
SDAs liken the pre-cross era to the toddler-young child age when parents make<br>
rules (i.e. laws) that may seem abitrary because not mature enough to understand.  Then after the cross, man had matured in his ability to know and understand<br>
God, so the "demanding jealous God" became more "loving."  As your children<br>
grow, the rules of behavior and living in your household will change (and must<br>
change) to allow them maximum opportunity for growth and self-actualization.<br>
We don't make them go to bed at 8pm or take a nap.  We allow them more freedom<br>
by lessening (and changing) the rules.  This is what "dispensations" are all<br>
about.<br>

  I would beg to differ; it would seem to me that IF a person became <br>
convicted that it was still important to God that he keep His commandments, <br>
THEN no matter WHAT happens, as long as he keep them, thru Christ's <br>
strength, then a happy ending is GUARANTEED.  :-)<br>
  Don't forget, "All things work together for good to them that love the <br>
Lord," and "if you love me, keep my commandments."<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
I guess the point here is that none of our stories have ended yet. As for<br>
things always having a happy ending in the temporal sense, I'm sure you<br>
could think of some examples yourself where this isn't the case.<br>
<p>
As for "keep my commandments", the problem is in working out what God is<br>
saying with each one. In my opinion the commandments would read differently<br>
if God were to repost them in 1992. They would add up to say the same thing,<br>
but would read differently. In the meantime, we're left with the x000 B.C.<br>
version and a bit of help from Jesus at around 25 A.D.<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
  I will admit that sometimes it appears that some would use their <br>
"medical-related" or "unpaid" work to justify certain actions on the <br>
Sabbath, but remember that Jesus is our example, not others.  See what he <br>
did on the Sabbath - how did he work and act on the Sabbath?  You'll see <br>
that Christ's emphasis is one of WORKING for others and not being engrossed <br>
in the work of self-gratification or "thine own pleasure."<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
The interesting thing about Jesus' Sabbath miracles is that none of them were<br>
urgent medical things. ie they all could have waited until Sunday. People born<br>
blind or lame, or with a withered hand, could all have held on for one more <br>
day out of 40-odd years! So he was obviously trying to make a point, and I<br>
think the thing about liberation of people and working for others could well<br>
be an important aspect of Sabbath.<br>
<p>
This idea first occurred to me when reading Isaiah 58. I wondered whether <br>
perhaps the whole chapter could be applied to the Sabbath instead of just the<br>
last two verses (which is what is usually done). If so, then this chapter<br>
says that we shouldn't waste holy time in introspection etc., but that we<br>
should use the day constructively, helping others. But is that a fair<br>
way to read the chapter? I'm no Hebrew scholar!<br>
<p>
Tony<br>
<p>
p.s. I believe that an important communication method for God is using his<br>
     human representatives on Earth. Hence I don't believe that I am cutting<br>
     God out by going to you guys with these questions etc. Quite the opposite!<br>

Yes, I also liked it.  I only wished she had timed it right - before <br>
we went to our Sabbath school classes and not after.  I also had a few<br>
comments which would have been relevant if they were before the Sabbath.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
It's a sad, sad day when comments are only relevant if they can be<br>
used by a Sabbath School class teacher!! Hey, I am all for making<br>
SS discussions as constructive as possible, but why should the discussion<br>
cease being relevant once the class is over? If that's really how it<br>
is then why are we bothering at all?!<br>
<p>
Is that really what you meant to say, Bill?<br>

Christ said his yoke is easy, but nowhere did he promise Christians they<br>

trials are guaranteed to Christians. Yes our problems might be great -<br>
and I do not intend in anyway to indicate lack of sympathy for those<br>
who experience Sabbath trials (I've had my share in the past) - but in<br>
the midst of these, we must remember that nothing can separate us from<br>
God's love for us, that he is working out a greater purpose than we might<br>
be able to comprehend, that he will not let us be tested beyond our <br>
limits, and that in the end, his promise of eternal life is certain.<br>
The Church also has a responsibility to support those for experience<br>
trials - when one member of the body suffers, we all suffer.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; So here's my question.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Someone at uni wants me to do something on Saturday. Maybe it's help out</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a public demonstration. Maybe it's just a social activity. I say,</i><br>
<i>&gt; "thanks, but my Saturday's are booked to God, and besides, I don't want</i><br>
<i>&gt; to miss church" or whatever. Perhaps then they ask me to explain about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Sabbath. My explanation would probably include "holy day", "worship",</i><br>
<i>&gt; and "no work" if I am a typical SDA.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The only problem is, I do often work on Saturday, and I do often miss many</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the aspects of public worship. How can this contradiction be resolved?</i><br>
<i>&gt; SDAs seem to be quite happy about work on Sabbath, so long as it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; medical-related and/or unpaid.</i><br>
<p>
I am a deacon in a congregation of about 180 people. My Sabbaths tend to be<br>
quite busy, especially so if I have the sermonette or youth Bible Study.<br>
The Sabbath is much busier still for the pastor. I see no contradication<br>
in the work I, or the pastor does on the Sabbath. The Sabbath was probably<br>
the busiest day of the week for the Levitical Priesthood, yet their service<br>
was necessary for the worship of God as ordained by God himself. Their<br>
service (and my service) is an act of sacrifice on behalf of the greater<br>
needs of the congregation. It is not doing my "pleasure" or "business" -<br>
ie. my interests, my concerns and my work - as such (Is 58:13).<br>
<p>
To attend my place of employment however would most certainly be doing my<br>
interests - putting other things ahead of the worship of the True God.<br>
<p>

<p>
<i>&gt;Subject: Saturday versus Sunday</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;SDAnet,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I posted what I did to try to stimulate some thinking.  (I get tired of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;memorized standard replies posted without thought.)  To give you a good</i><br>
<i>&gt;example of what I was trying to convey (which appears to have been misunderstood), try this one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;SDAs believe in the law of tithing.  Although tithing has not been a test of</i><br>
<i>&gt;membership in general, it certainly has been used for purposes of selecting</i><br>
<i>&gt;church leaders and employees.  Well, the tithing system set up for Israel</i><br>
<i>&gt;required that the FIRST fruits be given as tithe.  Not the 2nd or 3rd tenths.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yet, I have never heard an SDA vehemently argue that your tithing was not</i><br>
<i>&gt;acceptable to God unless it was the VERY FIRST CHECK you wrote after getting</i><br>
<i>&gt;your paycheck (First fruits).  How many SDA belief their tithe is acceptable</i><br>
<i>&gt;if paid AFTER the rent or mortgage but before anything else?  Is that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;FIRST fruits?  No!!!  Is it acceptable to God?  Absolutely!  Why?  Because</i><br>
<i>&gt;the spirit of the law of tithing is to give 10% to God.  Yet SDAs do this</i><br>
<i>&gt;literal thing on the 7th day Sabbath.  Is worship on the first day of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;week acceptable?  Absolutely!  How about the 2nd, 3rd, 4th..etc.  Absolutely!</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think God would be thrilled if we became devout enough in our submission</i><br>
<i>&gt;and worshipped EVERY DAY of the week!  Does it break God's law to worship</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the First day of the week if you also kept the 7th?  No!  This is why I</i><br>
<i>&gt;cannot understand the idea that my entire Salvation rests on whether I keep</i><br>
<i>&gt;the "right" day of the week!  I don't believe God is that dogmatic or</i><br>
<i>&gt;arbitrary (I know, using arbitrary will bring a flood of EGW quotes from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Great Controversy).  But I use it here to make a point.  Is God arbitrary</i><br>
<i>&gt;about anything in the plan of salvation?  Yes, Jesus was the only one to</i><br>
<i>&gt;live a perfect life and worthy to offer as an atonement.  But if there had</i><br>
<i>&gt;been a second being, did it have to be Jesus?  Would only Jesus' blood have</i><br>
<i>&gt;paid the debt?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, Jesus was the only one who could have paid the debt.  You could have<br>
lived a perfect life, but that would not pay the debt.  You were born as a<br>
woman, under the penelty of sin.  This was handed down from our mutual father<br>
Adam and our mutual mother Eve.  NO ACT OF MINE CAN SAVE ME OR OTHERS.<br>
<p>
Jesus died ONCE for mankind.  Only the substitutionary death of Jesus would<br>
pay the debt that I have with God.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I also don't understand how SDAs can claim that pre-cross and post-cross</i><br>
<i>&gt;requirements for salvation were NOT different.  What would have happened</i><br>
<i>&gt;to an Israelite if he said his family wasn't going to offer animal sacrifices</i><br>
<i>&gt;because they believed the Jesus future blood would be sufficient?  Would he</i><br>
<i>&gt;and his family been allowed to stay in the encampment?  No!  The sacrifice</i><br>
<i>&gt;was REQUIRED and NECESSARY.  Without spilling of animal blood, there was</i><br>
<i>&gt;no atonement for sin before the cross.  Whether the cross was the fulfillment</i><br>
<i>&gt;of a covenant that could not be kept by pre-cross Israel is immaterial.  There</i><br>
<i>&gt;are clearly two different "dispensations."  SDAs quickly agree that the Law of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Moses "was nailed to the cross."  Was the Law of Moses given of God?  Yes!</i><br>
<i>&gt;Was it God's Law then?  Yes, to Israel it was the requirements of God.  Did</i><br>
<i>&gt;God change or overturn His own law?  Absolutely!  I'm not buying a lamb and</i><br>
<i>&gt;slaughtering it every time I need to repent and ask for forgiveness!  So does</i><br>
<i>&gt;God change His laws?  Yes, we have clear evidence that He did for Israel. Could</i><br>
<i>&gt;God change His law(s) now or in the future?  Yes.  </i><br>
<p>
Cheryl, you obviously have confused several things.  First, what law are we<br>
speaking of here?  Is it a law that was contained in ordinances and sacrifices?<br>
If so, then this law had to change.  Why, because it pointed to the one whom <br>
would be the "Lamb of God".  Does that change the law of God?  No, it does not.<br>
There is only one law that I know sin by.  This law points up to what is wrong<br>
in my life.  That is the law of God.  Is this law arbitrary?  Yes, it is.<br>
<p>
Why is it arbitrary?  Because we would never understand what God was like <br>
without God telling us.  His character is so far from ours we could never<br>
even imagine a God like this.  The law was not given to Israel only.<br>
Remember, long before there was Abraham, there were sacrifices.  Noah was not<br>
a Jew.  Neither was Adam and Eve.  Yet these had knowledge of sacrifices.<br>
They understood the covenant that had been made in Eden, when Jesus promised<br>
to provide the sacrifice Himself.<br>
<p>
Dispensations?  No, there is only one way in mankind has been saved.  Re-read<br>
Hebrews 11 for more information.  The sacrifices were a confirmation that the<br>
believer accepted God as his Lord and Saviour and that God would save him<br>
from the sins he/she was confessing.  Re-read the Psalms again.  Do you see<br>
the man there praising what he had done in sacrificing to God?  No you see a<br>
man, repentant pleading for the salvation that cannot come from sacrifices.<br>
Check out Isaiah again.  You see God unsatisfied with the blood of bulls and<br>
rams.  Why, because they had not been offered in faith.  The blood pointed to<br>
Jesus.  Without the faith that was to come, then the sacrifices were nothing<br>
more than a MEANINGLESS round of cerimonies that did NOT bring salvation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I have frequently heard</i><br>
<i>&gt;SDAs liken the pre-cross era to the toddler-young child age when parents make</i><br>
<i>&gt;rules (i.e. laws) that may seem abitrary because not mature enough to </i><br>
<i>&gt;understand.  Then after the cross, man had matured in his ability to know and </i><br>
<i>&gt;understand God, so the "demanding jealous God" became more "loving."  As your </i><br>
<i>&gt;children grow, the rules of behavior and living in your household will </i><br>
<i>&gt;change (and must change) to allow them maximum opportunity for growth and </i><br>
<i>&gt;self-actualization.  We don't make them go to bed at 8pm or take a nap.  We </i><br>
<i>&gt;allow them more freedom by lessening (and changing) the rules.  This is what </i><br>
<i>&gt;"dispensations" are all about.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, the rules of the house remain the same.  Don't lie, steal, etc.  Naps<br>
are for their physical benefit and do not have anything to do with basic<br>
rules of the household.  Allowing them the freedom to make their own<br>
decisions does not change the rules, nor does it give them leave to break<br>
them without any consequences.<br>
<p>
No, Cheryl, there is no such thing as "dispensations" under God's universe.<br>
We are saved by one thing, faith.  Jesus was trying his entire life to get<br>
the Jews to recognize that this is what was missing in their lives.  From<br>
Adam to the last man who has faith right before Jesus returns at the last, we<br>
are saved by one thing, not our actions - though they speak of our faith, but<br>
by our faith.<br>
<p>
If we have faith, then we follow what Jesus tells us to do.  How do we do<br>
that?  Only by the power of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.  He is the<br>
power to give me a change in my heart.  He provides the oil that I so<br>
desperately need.<br>

<i>&gt;Subject: please post</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Some of you may be able to relate to my situation.  If you can,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'd appreciate your thoughts.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Good, you're about to get some.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I teach mathematics at a state university.  Out of about 11,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;students, perhaps 25 are SDA's ranging in age from 18 to 45.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt;are single, married, undergraduates, grad students, full-time,</i><br>
<i>&gt;part-time, comfortable, poor, desperate, sick, and healthy.  What they</i><br>
<i>&gt;are NOT is seen, appreciated, noticed, significant, etc. as far as</i><br>
<i>&gt;the church is concerned.  Why is it that otherwise normal people</i><br>
<i>&gt;are so totally incapable of manifesting any interest in SDA</i><br>
<i>&gt;students living in their own town going to a state school?  All the</i><br>
<i>&gt;theology in the world can't explain that away.  Our adult members</i><br>
<i>&gt;are numb inspite of what they think of themselves.  This is also</i><br>
<i>&gt;true with regard to the conference "leaders" who make this town</i><br>
<i>&gt;home.  How do we get our members and "leaders" off their comfortable</i><br>
<i>&gt;backsides with regard to this problem?</i><br>
<p>
There is only one way for this to happen.  Have the students, even one or two<br>
is enough, and have them start to make some noise.  At our church, we started <br>
our own Valuegenesis evaluation.  Part of that included getting the students<br>
involved.  We invited the church family to participate in two nights (Tuesday<br>
evenings from 6:30 til ??:??) over two weeks to evaluate where the youth<br>
program should be going.<br>
<p>
One of the things that came out of this was a couple of the local Adventist <br>
youth said that we had nothing for the local state university students.  Perhaps<br>
we need to start an Adventist student association at some of our local colleges<br>
and university's.  Having this association would allow for some formal manner<br>
of reaching out to our youth, fellowship among the youth, and also a platform<br>
for reaching out to others in the university.<br>
<p>
But, I can honestly say this, until someone brings it up in a STRONG manner, <br>
nothing will happen.  Sad to say, but quite often, the squeeky wheel gets the<br>
greese.   :-(<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Never be afraid of speaking out for our young people.  Do it strongly, and with<br>
love and conviction.  The Lord will be with you as you endevor to perform the<br>
work of the God.<br>

Recently Scott mentioned Ignatius of Antioch's letter to the Magnesians. <br>
It appeared to me that he was pointing to the text as a proof that<br>
Ignatius was somehow supporting a Sunday Sabbath.  The text in question is<br>
Magnesians 9:1 : which has the portion that says, "no longer sabbatizing<br>
but living according to the Lord's life [or Lord's day]."  The text in<br>
context refers not to the Christians of that day but to the prophets of<br>
the Old Testament.  The chapter before directly refers to the prophets<br>
living according to Christ Jesus.  Then in the passage in question<br>
Ignatius makes a contrast between "those who were brought up in the<br>
ancient order of things" and "we".  Then the contrast is reemphasized with<br>
him returning to the prophets:  "how shall we be able to live apart from<br>
Him, whose disciples the prophets themselves in the Spirit did wait for<br>
Him as their Teacher?"  The prophets clearly kept the Sabbath, so it<br>
appears that Ignatius was probably refering to the way in which the<br>
Sabbath was being kept.  <br>

<i>&gt; Some of you may be able to relate to my situation.  If you can,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd appreciate your thoughts.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I teach mathematics at a state university.  Out of about 11,000</i><br>
<i>&gt; students, perhaps 25 are SDA's ranging in age from 18 to 45.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; are single, married, undergraduates, grad students, full-time,</i><br>
<i>&gt; part-time, comfortable, poor, desperate, sick, and healthy.  What they</i><br>
<i>&gt; are NOT is seen, appreciated, noticed, significant, etc. as far as</i><br>
<i>&gt; the church is concerned.  Why is it that otherwise normal people</i><br>
<i>&gt; are so totally incapable of manifesting any interest in SDA</i><br>
<i>&gt; students living in their own town going to a state school?  All the</i><br>
<i>&gt; theology in the world can't explain that away.  Our adult members</i><br>
<i>&gt; are numb inspite of what they think of themselves.  This is also</i><br>
<i>&gt; true with regard to the conference "leaders" who make this town</i><br>
<i>&gt; home.  How do we get our members and "leaders" off their comfortable</i><br>
<i>&gt; backsides with regard to this problem?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I have no easy answer, only an observation.  Example is a good teacher, and it<br>
doesn't have to start with the "leaders".  I live in a college town (about 10<br>
colleges within 30 miles (that's not counting Andrews U and LMC which are 60<br>
miles away).  There is a couple in the church that has a large house and they<br>
have a social every week for college students from anywhere (they invite the<br>
SDA's and urge them to bring a friend if they wish).  This allows for get <br>
togethers, feeling included, etc.  This couple also goes out of there way to<br>
offer temporary housing or other assistance to those who find themselved in<br>
need.  They aren't really leaders in the church (though I'm sure they hold some<br>
position), but they do a lot toward <br>
keeping the young adult population there, and sometimes getting it active in the<br>
church.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I know everyone can't do something like that, but my point is it can<br>
be small, it can start with one interested person, and it doesn't have to be<br>
a leader.<br>

Fred writes<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
May I suggest that the elaborateness of the preparations necessary for<br>
such type of services might encourage one to reconsider whether making a<br>
real production out of things is in harmony with Sabbath keeping.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
Yeah, that was the direction my thoughts first started to turn when the<br>
more complex programs became the rule rather than the exception. I mentioned<br>
the way I was feeling to a couple of worship committee people, often the<br>
ones who would ring me up during the week and say "I know you're busy, but<br>
how about a practice...I've been working flat out on this program for two<br>
weeks now" etc. etc. Their usual response was mixed, basically the same<br>
way I was feeling.<br>
 <br>
On the one hand we wonder whether a worship service requires this much <br>
preparation and "production". On the other hand we all admit that were we<br>
to give up our jobs as program coordinators/producers/presenters we would<br>
almost certainly keep coming along were someone else to take over in the<br>
same way. Secondly, we like to put as much quality into the services as we<br>
can, in keeping with the concept of giving your best to God. Thirdly, the<br>
whole issue of worship style is involved here, and as long as that issue<br>
remains controversial any steps we may take would appear to be statements<br>
on the actual style rather than its inherent production requirements.<br>
<p>
So we are still pondering that one. That's one of the reasons I'm interested<br>
in hearing all of your opinions.<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
By the way, while Sabbath is comparatively restful for most folk, it's<br>
incredibly busy for pastors.  Is their work wrong on the Sabbath?<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
I'm not sure about the bonus text, but besides that I would say that most<br>
of the comments in the previous paragraph would still apply. Some types of<br>
Sabbath activities keep pastors much busier than others. It seems to me that<br>
if the Sabbath is really important, even a pastor could arrange things so<br>
that it was having its correct function for him/her.<br>
<p>
But this is one of the things that bugs me a bit. When I demonstrate at uni<br>
in winter I don't leave the prac until just after sunset. By the time I get<br>
home Sabbath has started 45 minutes to 1 hour ago. Some people raise their<br>
eyebrows when they find out I don't get home until 6pm on a Friday afternoon,<br>
but some of those same people are the ones ringing me up at 8am on Saturday<br>
morning wanting me at church in half an hour for a practice. They have no <br>
problem expecting the pastor to work hard all Sabbath morning, help with the<br>
pot luck lunch, help coordinate ingathering in the afternoon and whatever else.<br>
I'm trying to work out whether or not that's a double standard. I think it<br>
probably is!<br>
<p>
By the way, myself and the program coordinators in my church do enjoy what we<br>
do. I am just wondering whether it really is in keeping with the Sabbath. If<br>
we didn't enjoy it we probably would have stopped long ago. :)<br>
<p>
Tony<br>
<p>
As for the medical work:  The basis is that Christ healed on the Sabbath.<br>
Therefore, any medically-related work is OK, right?  I would suggest a careful<br>
reading of EGW's counsel on Sabbath keeping at our health institutions.<br>
The index is a good place to start research.<br>

Dave,<br>
Take the initiative.  Start a Mid-week prayer meeting or a Friday night<br>
discussion and prayer group and seen how it goes with the students.<br>
Then invite the "leaders" to come and join or give presentations after<br>
which discussions would follow.  Make sure you control the topics for<br>
discussions.<br>
We did this at the University of Ghana and I believe it's still going on<br>
with the students over there.<br>

In response to Tony, I don't really separate health and religious<br>
reasons.  I view it as a religious duty to preserve health.<br>
<p>
I don't eat meat ever.  The reason is that if I started it would be<br>
easy to slide more and more till I always did it.  (Since I grew up<br>
eating meat.)  I don't think occasional meat eating is harmful<br>
unless you happen to get disease or antibiotics etc. from it, which<br>
is quite possible today.<br>
<p>
In an emergency I would eat meat.<br>

The standard answer to Bill Oblitey's question is that animals eat<br>
plants, so if you eat animals you cause more suffering to plants than<br>
if you eat plants.  But, I don't believe plants have any sense of pain,<br>
or very little.  God gave Adam the plants to eat, and the creation<br>
was very good at the beginning (Genesis 1 - 3).<br>
<p>
	Dave Plaisted<br>
<p>
[However, note that it was only after sin that "the herb of the field"<br>
was added to the fruits of the trees of the garden as part of Adam's<br>
diet.  So the diet went from things which did not necessarily involve<br>
killing the plant to things which did.  Not that plants can feel <br>
the pain, anyway.   SCT]<br>

One more thing to add:<br>
<p>
The single students, such as myself, also face their own hurdles.  Many are <br>
hesitant to commit much time to activities at the university-town church <br>
(which they may or may not have transferred their membership to) since they <br>
have social interests at another church or are seeking to form friendships<br>
at other SDA churches.  While I lived in the San Francisco Bay area, I <br>
enjoyed visiting other SDA churches and meeting new people.  I have been<br>
less able to do this since I have been a Sabbath School teacher.  Taking<br>
responsibilities at the local church necessarily curtails your travel.<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
With regard to Dave Thomas' post concerning SDA students at public<br>
colleges/universities, let me offer the following points.<br>
<p>
I am the President of Adventist Christians for Abundant Living -- a <br>
student organization here at Purdue University.  When we organized a <br>
year and a half ago, we were enthusiastic about the possibilities for <br>
evangelism and vibrant social life that awaited us.  I remember typing<br>
up a list of the goals we had -- sort of a statement of purpose.  That<br>
was 1990.  We still exist as an organization, but have had a hard time<br>
maintaining our enthusiasm.<br>
<p>
Students are pulled in many directions.  We are busy.  When I was <br>
employed as an engineer I simply had more free time than I do these<br>
days.  I see lack of time as probably the biggest practical impediment<br>
to a vibrant, active SDA student organization.  The married students <br>
(especially those with children) really need to devote the bulk of their<br>
free time to strengthening their family ties.<br>
<p>
Lack of money is also a significant concern.  To bring a speaker for a <br>
series of weekend meetings costs money.  I believe we could make more<br>
of an impact at Purdue if we could invite students to a lecture where<br>
someone affiliated with one of the church's colleges/universities could<br>
speak to issues they are interested in from an Adventist perspective.<br>
<p>
Last school year, our organization collected funds from our members and<br>
a few others at church to place excerpts of Steps To Christ in the <br>
Purdue student newspaper.  A small excerpt was printed one day per week.<br>
We were able to print all of the first two chapters during the Spring <br>
semester.  A number of students and one staff member requested a free<br>
copy of the book.  We even had one student and his girlfriend (wife?) <br>
visit our local church.  Our dillema is that we don't have a good follow-up<br>
program in place.  Without the commitment of our own members to regularly<br>
attend meetings (especially planning meetings) it is hard to see how we<br>
are going to be able to hold the interest of students who become acquainted<br>
with us.<br>
<p>
In spite of our troubles getting going we have made a small impact on the<br>
campus.  We were involved in a group Bible study with one student.  Though<br>
he quit studying with us after a few weeks, seeds have been planted.<br>
<p>
There are so many organizations on campus, but I've not seen any that<br>
are portraying God in quite the way Adventists understand Him.  I pray that<br>
we can become an influence for good on this campus.  There is a real need<br>
here.<br>
<p>
Dave, I would be cautious in stating that the denomination (and,  by <br>
implication, many local congregations) do not appreciate, notice, or <br>
value the contributions of the students at public colleges/universities.<br>
I have received words of thanks from a number of members in West Lafayette<br>
for the contributions I have made to our worship services.  If students<br>
involve themselves in the local church they will be noticed.  <br>
<p>
Still, a general lack of understanding as to what are the particular needs <br>
of the students remains.  I see this as part of a larger problem -- the <br>
growing isolation of many groups, brought on in part by the rapidly changing<br>
world in which we live.  I don't think more than 15% or so of our members<br>
(indeed, of society at large) understand much about what an electrical<br>
engineering student studies.  Likewise, the daily activities of many of<br>
our older members are largely unknown to me.<br>
<p>
To end this somewhat lengthy post, let me offer one suggestion that I <br>
believe would draw us closer to our local church members.  Get together<br>
for Sabbath lunch!!  I enjoy very little mealtime communion with anyone <br>
most days.  Sabbath could be different, for God has graciously mandated <br>
that we take a rest.  I don't have in mind just potlucks.  Those members<br>
who have homes large enough to have a few mealtime guests need only provide<br>
a pot of soup and some bread.  Students will flock to where the food is.<br>

Three years ago when I was resident on the Carnegie Mellon campus,<br>
as I am now, I registered our church with the Campus Ministry Council,<br>
thus putting us in the directory of churches that is handed to all students.<br>
(Our church in Pittsburgh is about 3/4 mile from campus.)  We called<br>
our on-campus presence Sigma Delta Alpha.  For one semester I ran a program<br>
called "Let's Talk Relationships" where people would just get together <br>
and talk about issues in human relations.  Free food guaranteed that <br>
someone would always come, although I was handicapped due to an obscure<br>
location.<br>
<p>
Sometimes professionals in the community that could relate well to students<br>
don't because they are not sensitive to the fact that students are on a<br>
limited budget.  Our pastor has been very hospitable to the various<br>
students within our congregation, and if he didn't live 20 miles from<br>
campus, I'm sure he would have us over even more.  <br>
<p>
As far as involvement in the local church is concerned, this is sometimes <br>
handicapped when churches start their church offices in Jan., when the<br>
school year is already half over and people can't commit to the next<br>
full calendar year.  I solved the problem personally by finding niches<br>
that don't necessarily require a church office.  In all the positions of<br>
responsibility I have held in various churches, I have somehow managed<br>
to avoid a title that would put me on the Church Board.<br>

This is a post from Scott Mattes, edited by me:<br>
On Wed, 2 Sep 1992 12:06:17 -0400 (EDT) you said:<br>
<i>&gt;[SDA's don't deny that Sundaykeeping began as early as the mid 100's AD.</i><br>
<i>&gt;As far as the New Testament itself is concerned, there is no doubt.  Some</i><br>
<i>&gt;may have been generated in Scott's mind by reading the classic Mormon</i><br>
<i>&gt;work "A Marvelous Work And A Wonder", in which LeGrand Richards makes</i><br>
<i>&gt;outright lies in his interpretation of New Testament Greek.</i><br>
<p>
Steve,<br>
  Did I catch you on a bad day or something?  At the very least the<br>
wording of your response is very out of character.  It is also of the<br>
type used by most, if not all, of the groups/people who rail against<br>
what they perceive as cults.  That is, make a bold and negative<br>
statement against something/one of the 'other side' but offer no<br>
proof/explanation of your statement.  The reader/hearer is therefore<br>
presented with a problem, do I believe the person making the statement<br>
about the 'cult' or do I go and research it for myself and make sure.<br>
99 times out of 100 the reader/hearer will accept the bold and negative<br>
statement and never question it.  I had thought better of you.<br>
[I didn't have the book at hand.  If I had, I would have checked.  As<br>
you will see, I should have checked.  SCT]<br>
<p>
  To clarify, as a Lutheran I was brought up 'keeping' Sunday (I now<br>
know that the keeping I was taught was a joke, at best).  As LDS I read<br>
D&amp;C 59 and knew that the Lord had sanctioned the keeping of the 1st day<br>
of the week as the Sabbath.  I also learned what it meant to truly keep<br>
that day holy.  It wasn't until much later that I ever read the book you<br>
speak against.<br>
<p>
  To those who are in the 1 out of the 100 and want to know for<br>
yourself, I offer a copy of the book maligned by Steve at no cost to<br>
you, just email me with your address and I'll ship it to you (anywhere<br>
in the world!  Right Ruben?).  Then you can judge for yourself.<br>
<p>
  On to Steve ascertains.  Since he wasn't at all specific I went back<br>
and read the chapter he 'must' be referring to (the one on the Sabbath)<br>
and still I wonder exactly what Steve takes exception to.  Brother<br>
Richards list Mk 16:2,19 Lk 24:1 Jn 20:1,19 Acts 20:7 and 1 Cor 16:2 as<br>
places that the original Greek had the word 'sabbaton' or Sabbath.  When<br>
I look in my Strong's concordance I see that he is correct.  From the<br>
context of the passages I think that they refer to Sunday.<br>
<p>
[These words from Scott forced me to check.  After the check, I must retract<br>
and say that the author of that book is not lying, although he is certainly<br>
misinterpreting.  In Mark 16:2  "In the end of the sabbath, as it began<br>
to dawn towards the first day of the week...."   The word 'sabbaton' appears<br>
twice in this verse, once referring to the sabbath and once as part of <br>
a phrase 'mia sabbaton' which is translated 'first day of the week'.  The <br>
people of that time reckoned all their days according to the Sabbath.<br>
You will notice if you look at the second definition of 'sabbaton' it also<br>
refers to the weekly cycle itself.  So the case above is just a<br>
misinterpretation of the context in which the word is found.   SCT]<br>
<p>
[Some of Scott's post edited out here]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;in different times.  Unlike the LDS, we require consistency between all</i><br>
<i>&gt;prophetic messages.  SCT]</i><br>
<p>
  This smacks of the same "believe me when I tell you what these others<br>
believe, you don't have to check it out for yourself" attitude.  For<br>
shame.<br>
[Mormon missionaries said to me that it's not the internal consistency <br>
of the works that really matter.  I did check it out for myself,  I'm<br>
not afraid if others do the same.  SCT]<br>
<p>
  P.S. you might want to also include in your list of lying books the<br>
one 'Evidence that demands a verdict by Josh McDowell'.  He has stuff in<br>
there about Sunday sabbath also.  It agrees with the LDS book (or maybe<br>
the agreement is the other way around, or just complimentary).<br>
[The agreement is there because Josh is also willing to suspend belief<br>
at times and make evidence out of stuff that is really not evidence.  SCT]<br>

I would like to thank Tim for his information concerning the activities of<br>
Adventists at Purdue.  I am at the University of Iowa and we are trying to<br>
put together a student/university employee outreach group.  The<br>
description of how things started at Purdue sounds a lot like our group<br>
now!  I would also like to add that if anyone else has information or<br>
advice concerning Adventist groups at secular campuses, then please share<br>
it.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
Ian<br>

Steve, I think you handled the answer about work on the Sabbath very well.<br>
While I was beginning to type this post, I was thinking of the Wright<br>
Church in Mich. located not too far from Grand Rapids at Coopersville,<br>
MD. When I first went to pastor there in 1982. the Head Deacon would go to<br>
the church about 2:30 AM to turn on the heat so it would be warm by<br>
Sabbath School time!! Of course he could have done it before he went to<br>
bed! We helped him out a bit on that burden. The church had a high ceiling<br>
so we installed some ceiling fans to push to heat downward. By doing that<br>
the deacon did not have to turn on the heat till 6 AM!!<br>
<p>
Anyway, as you suggested for the Pastors, Sabbath can almost be the<br>
busiest day. At least two Sabbaths a month I do spend some time with my<br>
wife in relaxing activities. We enjoy driving a short distance to Oxford<br>
or St. Michael's at one of their parks watching the sail boats etc. We<br>
usually take some Sabbath reading material with us. We are just a few<br>
minutes from water in practically any direction so there are a lot neat<br>
things we can do on Sabbath.<br>
<p>
At our camp meeting I am in charge of the Public Address System and<br>
usually work from 6AM onward on Sabbaths getting mikes ready queing up<br>
tapes for the singers etc.<br>
<p>
At our home churches Evelyn and I are always arriving at church between<br>
7:30 AM - 8 AM (we are early birds) and seeing that everything is in<br>
order. Sometimes I set out the mikes etc for the sound engineer so she<br>
doesn't have to come extra early.<br>
<p>

Lisa, My first impression would be that the manager of the book store was<br>
truthful in his statement about students not knowing she was married etc.<br>
I know when I used to frequent Andrews U when I was mentoring Seminary<br>
students, -- I would hear from girls as well as boys that it would be<br>
helpful to have some sign of recognition. It was embarrassing for the<br>
fellas to ask a girl for a date and then find out that she was married.<br>

<i>&gt; [However, note that it was only after sin that "the herb of the field"</i><br>
<i>&gt; was added to the fruits of the trees of the garden as part of Adam's</i><br>
<i>&gt; diet.</i><br>
<p>
But prior to the fall, every green herb was given as food to<br>
everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life<br>
(Gen.1:30).  Green herbs being meet for food was not part of<br>
God's curse for sin.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; So the diet went from things which did not necessarily involve</i><br>
<i>&gt; killing the plant to things which did.</i><br>
<p>
This is ridiculous.  You cannot kill something that does not<br>
have life.  Read Genesis 1 &amp; 2.  The biblical concept of life<br>
does not include plants.  (Almost wrote plant life :^).<br>

Scott Mattes (and the rest of the LDS denomination) has made the claim that<br>
the Sabbath was changed, citing the authority of Joseph Smith, who in<br>
turn claims the authority of Peter, James, and John.  Most churches<br>
would respond to that claim by denying the latter-day gift of prophecy<br>
altogether, SDA's<br>
cannot do this since we also claim a latter-day prophet, namely Ellen G.<br>
White.  There are few people who accept the authority of both people.<br>
And since the two have made contradictory statements about the continuity <br>
of the Sabbath, we would think, at least in the SDA tradition, that one <br>
of them is wrong.<br>
<p>
Those who follow Joseph Smith as a prophet must accept the assumption he<br>
made, or revelation he claimed to have received, that the law of God is <br>
changeable in time.  When the Psalms refer to the law of the Lord as <br>
perfect, and Psalm 119, the longest chapter in the Bible, devotes all <br>
of that to praising the law of God, this tells me that the Law has<br>
not changed and cannot be changed any more than the character of God <br>
can change, since the law is a transcript of His character.  To this we <br>
add Christ's statement that "not one jot or tittle shall pass away from <br>
the Law until all be fulfilled," and Paul's warning "if any man preach <br>
a gospel unto you different that what we have preached to you, let him<br>
be accursed."<br>
<p>
We need to look carefully at how prophets gain validity for us.  For <br>
most Mormons, it is the 'burning in the bosom' as referred to and<br>
recommended by the Book of Mormon.  I wonder how many SDA's also begin<br>
and stop at <br>
that level.  The emotional feeling and conviction of truth must and does<br>
come first, but we should then move from faith to understanding.  If we<br>
are to merely accept at face value every claim of inspiration (and this<br>
includes <br>
the Bible) we would have to believe a lot of contradictory things, perhaps<br>
even have to hire an "Electric Monk" as described by Douglas Adams.  <br>
We need to study inspired writings and those that claim to be inspired to see<br>
if their writings and their conclusions validate their claim to inspiration,<br>
and not go about postulating that which we can prove.<br>

After having read in various posts that<br>
<p>
* Saturday is almost certainly the correct seventh day<br>
* There is no "right reason" to keep Sunday as the Sabbath<br>
<p>
etc. etc., I just thought I'd like to add something extra to this discussion.<br>
<p>
Did you know that in Tonga Seventh-day Adventists worship on/keep Sunday?<br>
ie instead of, not as well as, Saturday.<br>
<p>
The story goes that they used to keep Saturday while the international date<br>
line went straight from one pole to the other. But then someone had the bright<br>
idea to bend it so that Fiji, a close neighbour of Tonga, would have the same<br>
calendar day as Tonga. (Check an atlas and you'll understand what I mean.)<br>
<p>
SDAs in the South Pacific had a quick panic session and decided that it wasn't<br>
really the day of the week that was important, but it really did have to be<br>
an even multiple of seven days since that original Sabbath in the garden. So<br>
when the weekday labels changed, they kept observing the seven day cycle,<br>
and now they keep Sunday!<br>
<p>
Fiji, just across the water, still keeps Saturday, as they weren't directly<br>
affected by the date line change.<br>
<p>
So how about that. All the Sunday-keeping Christians in Tonga may actually be<br>
worshipping on the "correct day", if the multiple-of-seven thing is right.<br>
<p>
Those who adhere to this point of view really should construct their own date<br>
line through Iraq, figure out which day of the week corresponds to the seventh<br>
day when this date line is the reference, and then start keeping it! :)<br>
<p>
For all those who have wished they didn't have to keep Saturday due to it <br>
being so weird, I have it on good authority from friends of mine in Tonga<br>
that it is definitely preferable to Sunday. Consider finishing work on <br>
Friday afternoon, having your do what you want day, then having Sabbath,<br>
then back to work the next day. One of my friends is a teacher, and has to<br>
prepare his classes on Saturday because he can't on Sunday. After years of<br>
being an SDA he finds it very hard to get motivated to do anything like that<br>
on Friday night and Saturday!<br>

On Fri, 4 Sep 1992 09:04:44 -0400 (EDT) you said:<br>
<i>&gt;Recently Scott mentioned Ignatius of Antioch's letter to the Magnesians.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It appeared to me that he was pointing to the text as a proof that</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ignatius was somehow supporting a Sunday Sabbath.  The text in question is</i><br>
<i>&gt;Magnesians 9:1 : which has the portion that says, "no longer sabbatizing</i><br>
<i>&gt;but living according to the Lord's life [or Lord's day]."  The text in</i><br>
<i>&gt;context refers not to the Christians of that day but to the prophets of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Old Testament.  The chapter before directly refers to the prophets</i><br>
<i>&gt;living according to Christ Jesus.  Then in the passage in question</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ignatius makes a contrast between "those who were brought up in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;ancient order of things" and "we".  Then the contrast is reemphasized with</i><br>
<i>&gt;him returning to the prophets:  "how shall we be able to live apart from</i><br>
<i>&gt;Him, whose disciples the prophets themselves in the Spirit did wait for</i><br>
<i>&gt;Him as their Teacher?"  The prophets clearly kept the Sabbath, so it</i><br>
<i>&gt;appears that Ignatius was probably refering to the way in which the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sabbath was being kept.</i><br>
<p>
the texxt that I was refering to is this;<br>
<p>
  "Those who were brought up in the ancient order of things, have come<br>
to the possession of a new hope, no longer observing the Sabbath, but<br>
living in the observance of the Lord's day on which also our life was<br>
sprung by him and his death.  (Epistle to the Magnesians, 101 AD,<br>
Chapter 9, Ignatius)"<br>
<p>
  This sounds like he was refering to people living at his time and not<br>
the prophets of old.<br>
<p>
  Coupled with this<br>
<p>
  "...The Christians of this century, in piety, assemble for the worship<br>
of God and for their advancement of the first day of the week, the day<br>
on which Christ reassumed his life; for that this day was set apart for<br>
religous worship by the apostles themselves, and that, after the example<br>
of the church at Jerusalem, it was generally observed, we have<br>
unexceptional testimony.  (Moshiem's Church History, Book 1, Century 1,<br>
part 2 Chap 4:4)"<br>
<p>
  Led me to believe that Sunday was observed VERY early in the church's<br>
history.  Note that Moshiem's Church Histoy, Book 2, Century 4, part 1,<br>
Chap 1:8 Constantine is talked about and the year 324 AD is used for<br>
him, so I am assuming that book 1, century 1 is refering to the years<br>
BEFORE 100 AD.<br>

Steve, I talked to Dr Shea this morning about the business of lost time<br>
and we may not be worshipping truly Sunday or Saturday. He mentioned to me<br>
that there is no way time could have been lost because of Sabbath keepers,<br>
Sunday keepers, and Moslems. He didn't have time to go into any scientific<br>
approach because I was teaching the SS class at the time.<br>
<p>
I am sure he could give you some scientific data though if he were<br>
contacted.<br>

[The calendar history is well-known since the days of Julius Caesar,<br>
when the Julian Calendar was promulgated.  Since that point it has <br>
been documented by any astronomical society you care to find that<br>
the weekly cycle has not slipped a day.  Up to that point, there<br>
were various communities of Jews, none of whom disagree on what day <br>
is the Sabbath, even to this day, and some of them have been separated<br>
(as in the case of those recently rescued from Ethiopia) for hundreds of<br>
years.  SCT]<br>

Hi all<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;God change His law(s) now or in the future?  Yes.  I have frequently heard</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The Law of God and Moses's law are not the same and scripture does<br>
not make them the same :<br>
<p>
<p>
The scriptures tell us of two main sets of laws, the moral and the ceremonial<br>
or if you wish the Decalogue and the Levitical Law (the Law of Moses).<br>
One was preexistant, and eternal it is the standard of righteousness, the<br>
revelation of the righteousness of Christ, the other was given to Israel at<br>
Sinai which was a "shadow of things to come" and pointed forward to the Messiah.<br>
--------<br>
One was spoken by The Lord himself :<br>
<p>
Exo 20:1 And God spake all these words, saying, (KJV)<br>
Exo 20:2 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of<br>
         Egypt, out of the house of bondage. (KJV)<br>
Exo 20:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children<br>
          of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.<br>
          (KJV)<br>
<p>
The other was spoken by Moses<br>
<p>
Exo 24:3 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all<br>
         the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said,<br>
         All the words which the LORD hath said will we do. (KJV)<br>
--------<br>
One was written by the Lord himself<br>
<p>
Exo 31:18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with<br>
          him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone,<br>
          written with the finger of God. (KJV)<br>
Exo 32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing<br>
          of God, graven upon the tables. (KJV)<br>
<p>
The other was written by Moses<br>
<p>
Deu 31:9 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons<br>
         of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all<br>
         the elders of Israel. (KJV)<br>
Exo 24:4 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the<br>
         morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars,<br>
         according to the twelve tribes of Israel. (KJV)<br>
--------<br>
One was written on stone (note the perpetuity of the symbolism)<br>
<p>
Exo 31:18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with<br>
          him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone,<br>
          written with the finger of God. (KJV)<br>
<p>
the other was written in a book<br>
<p>
Exo 24:4 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the<br>
         morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars,<br>
         according to the twelve tribes of Israel. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Exo 24:7 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the<br>
         people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be<br>
         obedient. (KJV)<br>
--------<br>
One was put inside the Ark of the Covenant<br>
<p>
Deu 10:5 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables<br>
         in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded<br>
         me. (KJV)<br>
1 King 8:9 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which<br>
           Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the<br>
           children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. (KJV)<br>
<p>
The other was put  "by the side of the ark"(ARV)<br>
<p>
Deu 31:26 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the<br>
          covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness<br>
          against thee. (KJV)<br>
<p>
--------<br>
One was given to Moses by the Lord<br>
<p>
Exo 31:18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with<br>
          him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone,<br>
          written with the finger of God. (KJV)<br>
<p>
the other was given to the Levites by Moses<br>
<p>
Deu 31:24 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words<br>
          of this law in a book, until they were finished, (KJV) Deu 31:25 That<br>
   Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant<br>
          of the LORD, saying, (KJV)<br>
Deu 31:26 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the<br>
          covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness<br>
          against thee. (KJV)<br>
--------<br>
One is a law of liberty<br>
<p>
James 1:25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth<br>
           therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work,<br>
           this man shall be blessed in his deed. (KJV)<br>
<p>
keeping the other law looses ones liberty<br>
<p>
Gal 5:1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us<br>
        free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Gal 5:3 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a<br>
        debtor to do the whole law. (KJV)<br>
--------<br>
One reveals sin<br>
<p>
Rom 7:7 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not<br>
        known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law<br>
        had said, Thou shalt not covet. (KJV)<br>
<p>
1 John 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the<br>
           transgression of the law. (KJV)<br>
<p>
The other prescribes offerings for sin<br>
<p>
see Leviticus etc<br>
--------<br>
One deals with Moral matters<br>
Exo 20<br>
<p>
The other deals with Ceremonial matters<br>
Lev 7:37 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of<br>
         the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the<br>
         consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; (KJV)<br>
--------<br>
Breaking one incures penalty of death<br>
Rom 6:23 "For the penalty of sin is death"<br>
<p>
No such penalty for breaking the other<br>
--------<br>
One is established through faith in Christ<br>
<p>
Rom 3:31 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we<br>
         establish the law. (KJV)<br>
<p>
The other was abolished by Christ<br>
<p>
Eph 2:15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of<br>
         commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain<br>
         one new man, so making peace; (KJV)<br>
Heb 7:18 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for<br>
         the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. (KJV)<br>
        (this refers in the context to the ceremonial law)<br>
--------<br>
One is spiritual<br>
<p>
Rom 7:14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under<br>
         sin. (KJV)<br>
<p>
The other is carnal<br>
<p>
Heb 7:16 Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the<br>
         power of an endless life. (KJV)<br>
--------<br>
How about a little summary of the above comparison<br>
<p>

In the first 7 days of September we processed 83 messages through SDAnet.<br>
This is, as far as I know, a record for any given week.  The problem is <br>
that many of these messages have bounced back at me because people's machines<br>
have been down.  Tracking down down machines and sorting through all the <br>
bouncing messages is the biggest hassle of moderating SDAnet.  You folks<br>
can help by letting me know in advance when you are going to lose an <br>
account or when your machine is going to be down for an extended <br>
period of time.  <br>
<p>
If we continue at this pace for the rest of the month, we will set an all-<br>
time record for SDAnet traffic.  Let's keep it going.<br>

SDA-L specifically is for exchange between SDA students and faculty on<br>
college campuses (as opposed to the more doctrinally oriented list SDAnet<br>
which I moderate.)  With that goal I propose a thread of biographies where<br>
we share about each other, and possibly also the type of people we might<br>
like to meet.  I follow with my own (though obviously most people know<br>
about me<br>
already)<br>
<p>
My name is Steve Timm, I'm 26 years old, white, male, and single. I was<br>
raised in the SDA church, born and raised in the metro area of Grand<br>
Rapids, MI.  I attended Cedar Lake Academy and Andrews University,<br>
graduating from there with BA in Physics and MS in Computer Science.<br>
I've been a graduate<br>
student at Carnegie Mellon in physics for four years now, going into the<br>
fifth.  I have about a year left to finish my Ph.D.  I spoke about<br>
Illinois a lot because I was living at Fermilab for the last two years.<br>
Now I am physically in Pittsburgh, the same town as my computers.<br>
<p>
Most of my fun revolves around helping young people.  This has led<br>
recently to puppet ministry, drama, being in several music groups,<br>
playing the organ and guitar.  We have the makings of a great band here<br>
in Pittsburgh and I<br>
have just begun to work with them.<br>
<p>
Types of people I would like to meet<br>
1)  Anyone with a job offer in physics.<br>
2)  Good speakers or artists that communicate well to youth.<br>
3)  Single females with a desire to travel and no objection to being poor.<br>
<p>
All right:  I've bared my soul to the net, now it's your turn.<br>
There are people who have been subscribed to the net since the beginning,<br>
and I don't even know their names.  Let's speak out.<br>

For most of the past year SDAnet members have sent replies to me about SDA-L<br>
posts.  In most cases I have not forwarded them to SDA-L.  This has resulted<br>
in discussion getting trapped on SDAnet and lower traffic on SDA-L.<br>
<p>
The policy will change as follows:  All posts sent to me with<br>
SDA-L in the subject line (which will put it in a special mailbox)<br>
will be forwarded  to SDA-L.  Note:  This is only for SDAnet members<br>
who have not subscribed directly to SDA-L, which is the majority.<br>
<p>
I urge everyone who posts to SDA-L  (yes, that means both of you)<br>
to begin every post with SDA-L just so we know which one is coming<br>
from what and the two networks do not seem to be one amorphous mass.<br>

Scott,<br>
<p>
that was the verse I was talking about.  What I used was a translation of<br>
the verse that was more in line with the actual Greek.  But regardless of<br>
whether the word life or day is included the context makes it clear that<br>
he is refering to the prophets.  I quote from the ANF version closing off<br>
parenthetical clauses.<br>
<p>
"If, therefore, those who were brought up in the ancient order of things<br>
have come to the possession of a new hope, no longer observing the<br>
Sabbath, but living in the oberservance of the Lord's Day, {on which also<br>
our life has sprung up again by Him and by His death--whom some deny, by<br>
which mystery we have obtained faith, and therefore endure, that we may be<br>
found the disciples of Jesus Christ, our only Master --} how shall we be<br>
able to live apart from Him,{whose disciples the prophets themselves in<br>
the Spirit did wait for Him as their Teacher}?"  <br>
<p>
In fact, just looking at this whole question once again I can see why one<br>
scholar said it actually makes more sense to translate the word life in<br>
there (which does appear in Greek manuscripts but is ignored it seems). <br>
There is a contrast in this passage between "we" and "those who were<br>
brought up in the ancient order of things."  This constrast makes more<br>
sense if the word life is included as then Ignatius's statements would be<br>
the following (leaving out the {} part above and inserting an alternative<br>
translation for the first part so life is included)<br>
<p>
"If, therefore, those who were brought up in the ancient order of things<br>
have come to the possession of a new hope, no longer observing the<br>
Sabbath, but living in the observance [or as the ANF editors note<br>
"according to"] the Lord's life ... how shall we be able to live apart<br>
from Him...?"<br>
<p>
Again, I don't see how the text can point to early Christians keeping<br>
Sunday as a Sabbath.  <br>
<p>
As far as the historian you mention, I am unfamiliar with him.  I must,<br>
however, question his statements given the texts of the New Testament and<br>
the statements of other historians.<br>

Ruben,<br>
<p>
Would you mind giving me a few scriptures that support the idea that<br>
God's Law is intended to portray or symbolize His character?  thank you.<br>
I appreciated your analysis of God's Law versus The Law of Moses.  However,<br>
I fail to see how the fact that God gave the law to Moses to give to the<br>
Isrealites would render it Moses's law rather than God's Law.  If God<br>
gave it (directly or indirectly), is it not still from God?<br>
<p>
Lisa also gave some interesting questions about God saying "Thou shalt<br>
not commit adultery unless you just can't get along with your spouse" (my<br>
paraphrase.)  But we do have scriptural evidence that God did make<br>
exceptions to Law.  Although He said "Thou shalt not kill", He instructed<br>
the Isrealites to kill men, women and children on several occasions.  In<br>
other words, "Thou shalt not kill unless I direct you to do so because<br>
they are a wicked nation."  Did the Isrealites break God's Law when they<br>
murdered and killed innocent women and children at His direction?<br>
<p>
If it is God's Law, does He have authority to change it?  (I'm not asking<br>
IF He would change it?)  If He has the authority to change it and a<br>
Christian bases his/her belief on a Sunday Sabbath on a direct command<br>
given to an individual whom they accept and believe is a prophet of God,<br>
then doesn't that Christian have a basis for accepting a changed Sabbath<br>
day?<br>
<p>

I was reading tonight about the early history of Adventism.  More specifically<br>
about the Great Disappointment of 1844 and the formal organization of the<br>
SDA church in 1861.  After a lengthy discourse on the error of interpretation<br>
of the significance of 1844, the book said that the understanding of the<br>
heavenly sanctuary came about.  Then came this statement:<br>
	"Thus they [early SDAs] became evenly more firmly persuaded that<br>
	the Bible must be permitted to be its own expositor, that every<br>
	related scripture must be allowed to add its interpretation to the<br>
	verse being studied.  They concluded that every assumption, every<br>
	belief, must be tested against Scripture and laid aside if it did<br>
	not measure up."<br>
In reference to the resistance and hesitancy to formally organize the SDA<br>
church, I found the following:<br>
	"After the Millerite ministers had been disfellowshipped from<br>
	their various churches in early 1844 for accepting the literal,<br>
	personal Coming of Christ, they referred to these churches as<br>
	"Babylon"--sources of unscriptural teachings and traditions and<br>
	thus sources of 'confusion'-the literal meaning of the word<br>
	Babylon.  They called for those who believed in the Advent of<br>
	Christ to 'come out' of spiritual 'confusion' and to stand on<br>
	the Bible and the Bible only" as their source of faith,<br>
	doctrine, and practice."<br>
<p>
	"For this loosely knit group to organize was to many of them<br>
	a return to Babylon.  Their feelings were so strong that many<br>
	were against adopting even a formal name.  Until the 1860s,<br>
	the lack of church organization presented serious problems.<br>
	People with strongly differing ideas on how the work of the<br>
	Gospel should be carried forward caused friction that threatened<br>
	to divide the various local groups of believers.  The record<br>
	published in the Review and Herald shows that Mrs. White differed<br>
	with most of her contemporary fellow believers on church order<br>
	and organization, a difference of opinion which often caused her<br>
	'anguish of spirit'.  In 1853 she said, 'The Lord has shown that<br>
	gospel order has been too much feared and neglected.'<br>
<p>
	"Finally heeding her counsels on the need for organization, in 1860<br>
	they adopted the name 'Seventh-day Adventists.'  By 1861 there was<br>
	enough support to organize churches and to create the Michigan<br>
	Conference.  Two years later, the General Conference of Seventh-<br>
	day Adventists was created to coordinate the work of the growing<br>
	church around the world.  The members regarded themselves not so<br>
	much as members of a denomination but as members of the remnant,<br>
	the 'latter-day" continuation of the Church since the time of<br>
	Christ, the historic movement composed of all those who have<br>
	believed that the Word of God is the final authority, that<br>
	Christ must control the life, and that Scripture must be <br>
	allowed to INTERPRET ITSELF if the Gospel is to remain pure, clear,<br>
	able to change hearts."<br>
<p>
What happened to this view of the Scriptures that many SDAs cannot allow<br>
the Bible to interpret itself and that the Bible and the Bible only<br>
should be the basis of doctrine?  The interesting point of the first<br>
quote is that every RELATED verse must be used to provide interpretation.<br>
Unfortunately, it is not easy to know when verses are related and when<br>
they are not.  Thus, attempts to link unrelated verses written in different<br>
eras and different contexts will frequently give an eroneous interpretation.<br>
So who decides which verses seem to be related and which are not?  The<br>
General Conference?  SDA theologians?  Individual believers?  (The Tragedy<br>
of Desmond Ford would deny the right of individuals to make this decision.)<br>
Is not this approach to doctrine just as dangerous as "the traditions of<br>
men?"<br>
<p>
The ending of the long quote above says that the early believers felt that<br>
the Sciptures must be allowed to interpret itself IF THE GOSPEL IS TO<br>
REMAIN PURE, CLEAR, ABLE TO CHANGE HEARTS.  If a prophet is relied upon<br>
to provide enlightenment to the scriptures, are the scriptures being<br>
allowed to interpret itself?<br>

I have done some study on the verse you referred to about changing<br>
times and laws.  Daniel 7:25 says:<br>
<p>
        "And he [the king that subdued 3 kings] shall speak great<br>
        words agains the most High, and shall wear out the saints<br>
        of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and<br>
        they shall be given into his hand until a time and times<br>
        and the dividing of time."<br>
<p>
Firstly, the Hebrew word used in this verse for laws is 'dath' rather<br>
than 'torah'.  'dath' is translated to mean law or sentence while<br>
'torah' is translated to mean direction or teaching.  Whenever the<br>
Law of God is referred to in Scripture, the word 'TORAH' is used.  But<br>
in this verse it is not.  So is this king thinking to change the<br>
10 commandments?  Not according to the Hebrew word used.  Also notice<br>
that Daniel says this king shall "think" to change times and laws.<br>
The Hebrew for "think" used here is "sebar" meaning to hope or purpose<br>
to change laws.  This king is hoping or purposing to change some laws<br>
but it is clearly NOT the torah or The Law of God.  And it doesn't<br>
indicate what the times are that are hoped to be changed.  The Hebrew<br>
word used here for times is "zeman" meaing season and is distinct from<br>
"iddan" which is used at the end of the verse "a time and times and<br>
the dividing of time."  I'm not certain what the "times" and "laws"<br>
are that this 3rd king hopes to change.  But it isn't God's Law (torah)<br>
and it isn't the calendar because the Hebrew word for day or days is<br>
"yom" or "yamin".<br>
<p>
This is a good example of how I feel SDA doctrine has been based on<br>
incorrect interpretation of scripture.  The original Hebrew does not<br>
support the idea that God's Law (10 commandments) are being changed<br>
here.<br>

<p>
You are a minister, right? Have you experienced any difficulties with church<br>
members who find out you aren't a "religious vegetarian" (ie you don't think<br>
it's Wrong to eat meat) ?<br>
<p>
I'm just wondering how my father would fare if he was spotted at McDonalds<br>
by certain members of his church! (He doesn't eat at MacDonalds - in fact,<br>
he only eats fish and chicken, and that only rarely. I wouldn't want anyone<br>
to get the wrong idea!)<br>

----&gt;<br>
The scriptures tell us of two main sets of laws, the moral and the ceremonial<br>
or if you wish the Decalogue and the Levitical Law (the Law of Moses).<br>
One was preexistant, and eternal it is the standard of righteousness, the<br>
revelation of the righteousness of Christ, the other was given to Israel at<br>
Sinai which was a "shadow of things to come" and pointed forward to the Messiah.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
Genesis 2:2-3<br>
<p>
"And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done, and he rested<br>
on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. So God blessed the<br>
                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all his work which<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^                  ^^^^^^^<br>
he had done in creation."<br>
<p>
<p>
Exodus 20:11<br>
<p>
"...for in six days the Lord made...and rested...therefore the Lord blessed the<br>
                                                 ^^^^^^^^^<br>
sabbath day..."<br>
<p>
<p>
Somewhere else<br>
<p>
"...the sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath."<br>
<p>
<p>
Seems that the fourth commandment, at least, refers to something which may<br>
just have been invented especially for our race. Why doesn't it say somewhere<br>
in the Bible, "...because everybody else keeps the seventh day holy"?<br>
<p>
Besides, the concept of a universal sabbath seems a bit strange, given the<br>
way in which we measure our days.<br>
<p>
Personally, I am of the opinion that the law is, as many others have said,<br>
purely a particular revelation of God. Its purpose is to help us diagnose<br>
our sinful condition, and to point towards God. Were God to give the law<br>
to late-twentieth-century western society, it would probably read quite <br>
differently. Jesus himself showed remarkable flexibility in his approach to<br>
the law when he was around. <br>
<p>
Progression on the part of the human race as<br>
a whole has affected the way God reveals himself, and the way he is perceived.<br>
I don't believe in dispensations in the sense that salvation is available<br>
through different means at different periods in history, but I do believe<br>
that God's relationship to man has changed over time.<br>
<p>
Obviously there are aspects of God which would come through any particular<br>
revelation, and through any moral law given to any culture.<br>

Here's an interesting point.<br>
<p>
Many Christians paint the picture of the Garden of Eden as a place where<br>
there was no death, and I mean none. I think (correct me if I'm wrong)<br>
EGW speaks of Adam and Eve watching the first leaf die or the first flower<br>
or something after they had eaten the fruit.<br>
<p>
So here's the question. If there was no death of plants, what were the fruit<br>
and flowers for anyway? Don't say for the initial reproduction of plants,<br>
because presumably man and animals would have still needed to eat fruit etc.<br>
after that initial period.<br>
<p>
btw, those who are concerned about plant suffering will obviously never<br>
walk on the grass!<br>

Network:<br>
<p>
Steve,<br>
I wanted to reinterate once more what I was trying to share with the net<br>
when I brought up the matter of "resting fully in Christ for our<br>
salvation." <br>
<p>
Really, I thought I would get some praise from the Mormons (especially<br>
Cheryl) and other Sunday keepers that might be on the net when I said,<br>
"Many Sunday keeping christians are resting fully in Christ for their<br>
salvation!" I still believe that! And, I still believe that a few, or<br>
some Adventists are keeping the Saturday/Sabbath for the wrong reasons<br>
when they believe their Sabbath keeping will save them. In other words<br>
another way of expressing it is this way: "How many Sabbaths does an<br>
Adventist have to observe or keep in order to be Saved?"<br>
<p>
I guess I threw up the "proverbial red flag" when I mentioned the wrong<br>
day as Sunday and the right day or Sabbath as Saturday. In my own thinking<br>
I was targeting 7th-day Adventists when I said what I did. SDAs usually I<br>
would think, would refer to Saturday as the right day and Sunday as the<br>
wrong day to worship.<br>
<p>
I suppose you could say that I do worship on Sunday because I visit Sunday<br>
churches to be able to fellowship with my "Sunday preaching brothers" and<br>
to get some fresh insights, illustrations from their sermons. However, I<br>
think the net understands where I am coming from, I believe that Saturday<br>
is the day I primarily should be worshiping God and I consistently do<br>
that. Some of my "Sunday preaching brothers" visit our church on<br>
Saturday. Once a year we exchange pulpits. I preach in one of the Sunday<br>
churches and their pastor preaches at our church on the previous day. I<br>
really enjoy it and it is a tremendous way for me to share my faith with<br>
them. When we can, our church choir combines with a choir from a Sunday<br>
church and have concerts in our church. At present we are developing a<br>
concert series that our church will be sponsoring once a quarter and it<br>
will be held in our church on Sunday afternoons. Some of the concerts will<br>
be done by Adventist groups. In December the Episcopalian choir will be<br>
doing a "Messiah Sing-a-long" at our church on Sunday afternoon.<br>
<p>
As far as Saturday Sabbath keepers are concerned I strongly believe that a<br>
person needs to be convinced in his own mind that Saturday is the day of<br>
worship that God requires. A neighbor friend of mine was quite upset about<br>
the Sabbath when it was presented in a seminar that we were conducting. My<br>
advice to him was not to concern himself about it, that I would be happy<br>
to study it with him later but that the important thing was to learn as<br>
much as he could from the Seminar. By the time the seminar was over, he<br>
was convinced in his own mind that Saturday was the day that God was<br>
asking him to observe and worship Him. <br>
<p>
Also, have been thinking of starting a preaching service in our Adventist<br>
church on Sunday mornings as an outreach for church growth. I would be<br>
targeting the unchurched people in our community who perhaps would be<br>
willing to attend church on Sunday at first but maybe not as willing on<br>
Saturday at first. <br>
<p>
I am not trying to "bash" the people who worship on Sunday. As far as I am<br>
personally concerned Sunday just does not hold any special significance<br>
for me other than just being another day like any other day of the week<br>
other than Saturday Sabbath.<br>
<p>
Hope I have made my point and position clear this time!!<br>
<p>
THOUGHT FOR THIS WEEK: "People cannot change truth, but truth can change<br>
people."   --------  Old Union Reminder<br>

Steve, <br>
<p>
Yes I agree that the weekly cycle has not been changed and I undstand<br>
that. Wasn't it 1582 -- I believe it was, -- for the lastest change and<br>
even then the weekly cycle was not changed. However, some believe that<br>
some time has been lost because of yeap years etc. So that a Saturday<br>
could really be a Tuesday and we wouldn't know it! I am really not delving<br>
into it that deeply. I believe that the weekly cycle has not been changed.<br>

Scott Mattes &amp; Network,<br>
<p>
Scott, <br>
<p>
Have been reading your messages on Sunday as the Sabbath, etc. I was<br>
sharing some of your thoughts with my soninlaw as we were driving from the<br>
Zoo in Salisbury back home today. <br>
<p>
Our observation is, that it is very neat that you have a prophet that<br>
through revelation received the word that the Sabbath had been changed to<br>
Sunday. In fact I understand the Book of Mormon was a revelation, or<br>
could I use the phrase, "prophetic messages" for North America just like<br>
the prophets in the OT &amp; NT received messages for Bible lands in Bible<br>
times.<br>
<p>
Adventist members are not that fortunate with Ellen White. Even though she<br>
did have revelations and visions everything she says seemingly point back<br>
to the Holy Bible or the scriptures. In fact EGW said one time that if the<br>
people would really study the scriptures they would not need her writings.<br>
That is really something isn't it?<br>
<p>

exceptions to Law.  Although He said "Thou shalt not kill", He instructed<br>
the Isrealites to kill men, women and children on several occasions.  In<br>
other words, "Thou shalt not kill unless I direct you to do so because<br>
they are a wicked nation."  Did the Isrealites break God's Law when they<br>
murdered and killed innocent women and children at His direction?<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
When I was in college my Hebrew-scholar Old Testament lecturer pointed<br>
out to use that in fact the translation "thou shalt not kill" is a<br>
little generous. Apparently the original hebrew text had two words which,<br>
literally translated, say "don't murder". Murder here means the killing<br>
in anger of another person.<br>
<p>
It seems fairly obvious that God never meant "don't kill at all", given<br>
the number of offences for which the penalty was death in the Levitical<br>
laws  eg a woman pretending she was a virgin when she wasn't.<br>
<p>
(So where *do* the hard-line pro-lifers get their ethical motivation??)<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;Yes, I also liked it.  I only wished she had timed it right - before </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;we went to our Sabbath school classes and not after.  I also had a few</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;comments which would have been relevant if they were before the Sabbath.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&lt;----</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's a sad, sad day when comments are only relevant if they can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;used by a Sabbath School class teacher!! Hey, I am all for making</i><br>
<i>&gt;SS discussions as constructive as possible, but why should the discussion</i><br>
<i>&gt;cease being relevant once the class is over? If that's really how it</i><br>
<i>&gt;is then why are we bothering at all?!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Is that really what you meant to say, Bill?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Tony</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
After reading your comments I realized what could be deduced out of mine.  <br>
I did not intend that her comments were not "relevant".  I was suggesting that<br>
they could have been shared with others who may not have the priviledge of<br>
reading what we put out on the net.<br>
I also meant to imply that I would not condone reharshing a topic when it <br>
has been "exhausted" unless ofcourse it is being discussed with a different<br>
twist (much like Lola's).<br>
Many of her ideas came out in my class and most of the time I felt like I was<br>
the only male bringing out those ideas so it felt refreshing to read hers,<br>
although after the fact.  Immagine how it would have felt to read such good<br>
comments (especially when they agrre with your ideas) before going to class!!!<br>

<i>&gt;* Saturday is almost certainly the correct seventh day</i><br>
<i>&gt;* There is no "right reason" to keep Sunday as the Sabbath</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;etc. etc., I just thought I'd like to add something extra to this discussion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Tony</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I feel like I have shared this too many times anbd have stopped talking about<br>
it but this discussion calls for it since I've never shared it on the net.<br>
<p>
In Ghana, West Africa, we are named accoring to the day of the week on which<br>
we were born (the so called god-given names).  I still use mine to this day.<br>
<p>
God (the omnipotent - to distinguish Him from the lesser gods) is called "The<br>
grat God whose day is Saturday".  The white man (who brought Christianity to<br>
Ghana and insisted on worshiping on Sunday) is called "The white man whose<br>
day is Snuday".  If I should take you (assuming your skin color is lighter<br>
than the normal sking color in Ghana) to Ghana today, people will refer to you<br>
as "Kwesi Broni" - literally "Sunday white person".<br>
<p>
There are other customs in the land that seem to run parallel with Bible time<br>
traditions, but this Saturday issue stands out like a sore thumb.  Many <br>
people use it in their Sabbath Sermon topics.<br>
<p>
Let me just stop here and not add anything of mine to the "story".<br>

<p>
----&gt;<br>
If a prophet is relied upon to provide enlightenment to the scriptures, are<br>
the scriptures being allowed to interpret itself?<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
I identify with the questions raised by Cheryl in this post. Thanks for<br>
the quotes Cheryl, I will definitely chase Schaefer's book up and read<br>
the whole thing.<br>
<p>
On the one hand I believe that the scriptures should stand alone.<br>
<p>
On the other hand I also believe that the influence of the Holy Spirit is<br>
important in the interpretation. I don't think the self-interpretation thing<br>
is such that the Holy Spirit is not required.<br>
<p>
The following questions arise in my mind.<br>
<p>
* Was God totally in control of the formation of the Biblical canon as we<br>
  know it today?<br>
<p>
* Why does the Bible stop at Revelation?<br>
<p>
* How did people relate to what we call the New Testament at the time during<br>
  which it was being written?<br>
<p>
* What is the role of a prophet?<br>
<p>
On the final question, I have heard it said that prophets always have a very<br>
contemporary role. That is, they are sent at a certain time, to a certain<br>
group of people, and for a certain reason. This pattern is certainly apparent<br>
in the Old Testament prophets. Apparently there were heaps more prophets around<br>
at that stage whose existence didn't make it into the Biblical record, apart<br>
from warnings to beware of the false ones.<br>
<p>
That's not to say that another group of people in another time can't benefit<br>
from the message delivered by the prophet. Only that the primary role of the <br>
prophet is very much contemporary.<br>
<p>
This fact should strongly influence the way we relate to the work of EGW. Her<br>
writings were mainly directed at individuals or groups, and were never intended<br>
to be broad messages to all generations of the future church. At the same<br>
time, much of what she wrote can be beneficial today if read with the correct<br>
perspective.<br>
<p>
I have heard it said from the pulpit and elsewhere that EGW is a messenger<br>
from God for our time. This may have been true when it was first said back<br>
whenever in the late nineteenth century. Now - the fact is that the lady has<br>
been dead for a long time. In the true spirit of conservatism, our church<br>
continues to refer to her message as though it has only just arrived.<br>
<p>
Tony<br>
<p>
P.S. My favourite book on prophets and people is 'Angry Saints' by <br>
     George Knight. A "must read" for all SDAs.<br>

Yup, when you have free food available you can get acquainted with<br>
students!  And as Lisa said, it doesn't have to come from the leaders<br>
of the church or conference.  At the Univ. of OK there were a few<br>
SDA students that we knew about and we and another few couples made<br>
sure that every student was invited over for Sabbath lunch somewhere<br>
EVERY Sabbath!  We had a small church and there weren't more than 5<br>
or so students, so it wasn't too difficult.  In a larger church you<br>
would need a few more cooperative families perhaps.  We were students<br>
ourselves and living in married student housing or a single wide<br>
trailer while there, but for 1 year we had an undergrad student come<br>
to dinner and stay most of the afternoon almost every week.<br>
<p>
We also registered with the campus organizations and started a campus<br>
ministry in a house close by the campus.  On Friday nights we offered<br>
free supper, singing, Bible study, and general socialization to SDA<br>
and non-SDA students who were interested.  This was somewhat less<br>
successful than the Sabbath afternoon efforts, possibly because it<br>
operated on a drop-in basis rather than weekly personal invitations.<br>
<p>
Even grad students with families (or perhaps ESPECIALLY those with<br>
families) would appreciate being asked over for Sabbath.  And Tim<br>
was right, it doesn't have to be a fancy meal.  We often had pasta --<br>
quick, cheap, and everyone likes it.<br>

<i>&gt;Our observation is, that it is very neat that you have a prophet that</i><br>
<i>&gt;through revelation received the word that the Sabbath had been changed to</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sunday. ............................................................</i><br>
<p>
  Ever stop to think that the same could have been said during the times<br>
of Isaiah, Daniel, etc?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;....... In fact I understand the Book of Mormon was a revelation, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;could I use the phrase, "prophetic messages" for North America just like</i><br>
<i>&gt;the prophets in the OT &amp; NT received messages for Bible lands in Bible</i><br>
<i>&gt;times.</i><br>
<p>
  That is basicly correct.  Writings of prophets of the house of Israel<br>
who lived on the American continents from 600 BC to about 400 AD.  You<br>
ought to read it alittle and see for yourself.  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Adventist members are not that fortunate with Ellen White. Even though she</i><br>
<i>&gt;did have revelations and visions everything she says seemingly point back</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the Holy Bible or the scriptures. In fact EGW said one time that if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;people would really study the scriptures they would not need her writings.</i><br>
<i>&gt;That is really something isn't it?</i><br>
<p>
  How come SDA's only had need of one latter-day prophet and not more?<br>

<p>
This is a non-issue. If the Sabbath day I keep today is the same day of<br>
the week as Jesus kept (in terms of a regularly repeating cycle of seven<br>
days, the days being defined as sunset to sunset), then that is sufficient.<br>
<p>
Jesus was (is) the Son of God who did not sin. Sin is the trangression of<br>
God's Law, including the law of observing the Sabbath. Therefore, Jesus<br>
observed the correct period of time within a 7-day week. And since Sabbath<br>
keeping Christans observe the same period of time as Jesus, they are<br>
observing the correct day of the 7 day week as the Sabbath.<br>
<p>
The Sabbath one of the signs identifying the people of God (Ex 31). It is an<br>
eternally binding covenant - as a memorial of creation and anticipation of<br>
the Millenium.<br>

<i>&gt; I am not sure if you are an Adventist or not.</i><br>
<p>
I am a member of the Worldwide Church of God.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I believe we can celebrate both times of the year without giving the</i><br>
<i>&gt; impression that we are following paganism [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; I certainly respect your views on Easter and Christmas; however, there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; things that we do in our society today that actually came from paganism</i><br>
<i>&gt; but does not have that connotation today -- as I mentioned in my previous</i><br>
<i>&gt; post to you -- the idea of hand shaking came from Paganism but I do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; think we refrain from it because it did originate with paganism. We use</i><br>
<i>&gt; the pagan names of the week and think nothing of it.</i><br>
<p>
I respect your views on this. But there is a distinction between Easter and<br>
Christmas observance and handshaking, days of the week, etc. In Deuteronomy<br>
God says:<br>
<p>
  "Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that<br>
  they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their<br>
  gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do<br>
  likewise. Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination<br>
  to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their<br>
  sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods. What<br>
  thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto,<br>
  nor diminish from it." (Deut 12:30-32)<br>
<p>
Our understanding of this passage is that we should neither add to, nor take<br>
from God's commandments on how to worship him. He explicitly commands against<br>
taking foreign modes of worship and applying them to the worship of himself.<br>
Granted that the nations around Israel worshipped in horrific ways (such as<br>
putting their children through fire) that we seldom see today, but I believe<br>
the principle of this verse applies today. It is a warning against syncretic<br>
religious practises.<br>
<p>
Easter and Christmas are most definitely syncretic religious festivals. <br>
Nowhere are Christians told to remember Jesus' birth. Christmas is derived<br>
from cultic sun-god worship, the Roman Saturnalia and like. Nor are we <br>
commanded to remember (in a formal sense with a religious service) Jesus'<br>
resurrection. The Friday crucifixion/Sunday resurrection, 1st Sunday after<br>
the vernal equinox, rabbit and egg motifs, etc., are all syncretic additions<br>
from non-Biblical sources. [As an aside, the WCoG believes Jesus was killed<br>
on Passover, Wednesday 14th Nisan, AD 31, buried as the annual Sabbath of<br>
the 15th of Nisan drew on, and then resurrected 3 days and 3 nights later<br>
at the close of the weekly Sabbath.]<br>
<p>
In contrast, handshaking, and even the names given to the days of the week<br>
have nothing explicitly to do with the commanded worship of the True God.<br>
<p>

Yep, that's right. But even if they had it doesn't matter because Jehovah <br>
told the Israelites the right time at Sinai. Also just to make sure we <br>
know that Jesus (our example in all things) at least would have kept <br>
the true Sabbath which He did, guess which day that was :^)<br>

For the OT scholars on SDA NET:<br>
Daniel 7:25 is written in Aramaic, a Semitic language, very similar to Hebrew,<br>
used throughout the Near East in antiquity and into the times of Christ.  Dan<br>
2:4 through 7:27 are written in Aramaic, the common language of Babylon in the<br>
time of Daniel.  The book of Ezra is also written in Aramaic.<br>
<p>
For this specific text, the Aramaic dictionaries give as follows:<br>
Holladay--"law of God = torah"<br>
Brown Driver Briggs -- "Law of God in mouth of non-Jews"<br>
<p>
The same word dath appears in Ezra 7 six times specifically tied to the phrase<br>
"of God."  See verses 12, 13, 16, 21, 25, 26.<br>
<p>
In Esther the word appears in the Hebrew narrative referring to laws and<br>
edicts of the Persian empire.  Evidently we have here a loanword, from Aramaic.<br>
The time of Ezra and Esther is approximately the same.<br>

How do we know we're keeping the same day Jesus kept when we live at such<br>
a different longtitude to that of Israel?<br>
<p>
Should we be keeping Sabbath on the day that has already started when<br>
Sabbath commences in Israel, or in the day that starts after Sabbath<br>
has commenced there?<br>
<p>
Remember the international date line was constructed by people for their<br>
own purposes.<br>
<p>
<p>
Sorry if this seems like a pointless argument, I just think that if it is<br>
so important that our seven day cycle lines up with the original then this<br>
is a significant question.<br>
[It is pointless.  Give it up.  SCT]<br>

Tony<br>
<p>
p.s. I'm still waiting to hear what you all think of the Tongan SDA's <br>
     keeping Sunday. They really do it, you know - I didn't make that one<br>
     up!<br>
[GOOD SDA's would move away from such a Pagan country that dared to change <br>
its calendar. :-)  SCT]<br>

Africa, Europe, and Asia are on a contiguous land mass with Israel.  So<br>
their Sabbath should be defined in a continuous way, so that a traveler<br>
from Israel would not have an abrupt change of day.  North and South<br>
America are closer to the west side of this land mass than to the<br>
east, so it's natural for us to align our days as if we could be<br>
reached by a continuous path from the west.  The Pacific Ocean is a<br>
grey area, I suppose;  depends which continent you are closest to.<br>

Sorry Scott, but if you wish to put forth the argument that the days -were-<br>
lost, it is up to you to present the evidence in support of your position.<br>
It is not up to the rest of the readers to prove that it -didn't- happen.<br>
Negative proofs are logically impossible.<br>
 <br>
For example:  Prove you're not a communist.<br>
<p>
The impossibility of such an effort is one of the main reasons that in our<br>
society, criminals are innocent until proven guilty.<br>
<p>
But back to the subject at hand:  It is not sufficient to say, "Well, in the<br>
many thousands of years since Adam and Eve walked the Earth, some days -must-<br>
have been lost,"  because that argument is not true.  Some days -may- have<br>
been lost, but there is no proof that it must be so, nor any that it did indeed<br>
happen.  Or at least, none that I have ever been apprised of.   There -is-<br>
historical evidence that numbered days were dropped off the calendar, but not<br>
the named days.  In other words, let's say that five days were lopped off the<br>
calendar starting the day after Saturday, July 12.  The next day would be Sunday,<br>
July 18, not Friday, July 18.<br>

renting churches<br>
<p>
<p>
Does anyone have some insight on renting practices of an SDA church to a <br>
Sunday keeping church?  I understand there may be some view points on <br>
both sides, those for and against it.  I realize the identity of the church <br>
may be an issue but if it is considered not to be of "radical" theology and<br>
temperament, should we rent to a Sunday keeping church?  Would it be<br>
promoting Sunday worship?    <br>
<p>
(This is to be debated at the next church board meeting and wonder what <br>
the debate is all about.)<br>

You said it is pointless... so give it up.  Maybe your right, but I don't <br>
understand how we arrive at beginning and ending of Sabbath.  Yes, I <br>
understand the Sunset to Sunset bit and feel it useless to "guard the<br>
edges of the Sabbath...(i.e. waiting till 8:47 before going out for ice<br>
cream)  But, I was at a loss for defending my sunset to sunset belief<br>
when a coworker made a joke.... "So what do the people in Alaska do?"<br>
I assume referring to long and short days depending on the season.<br>
By what principles do they keep the Sabbath?<br>
<p>

<p>
Let's turn the argument on its head:<br>
<p>
Is there any reason why a Sunday-keeping church should rent to an SDA<br>
congregation? They could reason that the SDAs are promoting worship<br>
other than Sunday. The West Madison, WI, SDA Church, back in 1988, was doing<br>
just that. They were meeting in rented facilities.<br>
<p>
If the revenue from renting the church to a Sunday-keeping congregation<br>
palys a significant role in keeping the doors open in the first place,<br>
and as long as the board is keeping watch on the kinds of congregations<br>
they allow in there, I would have no qualms. That church in Madison<br>
certainly didn't.<br>

<p>
Hi Alice,<br>
<p>
   The two churches I have attended the last 30 years have periodically<br>
rented their facilities to a "Sunday Keeping Church".  The conference<br>
posisiton is that each church may chose to do what they want to do.<br>
<p>
   I think there are several things to consider.  1.  Have a unbiased<br>
church business meeting and give your members an opportunity to hear<br>
the advanatages and disadvantages.  It is important that the church<br>
family is united in the proposal.  2.  If the church members chose to<br>
rent the church, create a list of guidelines such as rent amount,<br>
cleaning, what rooms are used, etc for the renter to agree too before<br>
the church is rented.<br>

   I have seen a church divided because the board approved the renting<br>
of a facility to a organization, then try to get the church to approve<br>
their action after the fact.  I have also seen another situation that<br>
followed some guidelines which has worked well for the both churches.<br>

I'm sorry if I've been a bit verbose on the net, but I am genuinely<br>
concerned about the issues I have been trying to raise and about the<br>
discussions I have contributed to. I don't make a habit of arguing<br>
pedantically about every little point, and that's not what I am<br>
intending to do on the net either. I just appreciate the opportunity<br>
to discuss these things with a fresh group of people, and particularly<br>
with a group of people living elsewhere!<br>
<p>
I guess the reason I am bringing up this stuff about the Sabbath is<br>
because I am (I admit) a rationalist at heart. I'll give you a couple<br>
of examples to illustrate what I mean.<br>
<p>
* I believe that love (in the "God is love" sense) is the set of<br>
  behaviours which works to maintain a cohesive and harmonious<br>
  universe. I don't believe that it is some arbitrary ideal whereby<br>
  God said "I'd like everybody to behave this way because it is a<br>
  nice idea".<br>
<p>
* I believe that sin is the complementary set. ie sin is those things<br>
  which do not work to maintain a cohesive and harmonious universe.<br>
<p>
* I believe that any directions we may receive from God regarding <br>
  anything at all are designed purely and simply to help us reach <br>
  the stage where we are contributing to the harmony and not the<br>
  disharmony. I don't believe that God arbitrarily assigns rules and<br>
  regulations for no reason.<br>
<p>
etc.<br>
<p>
I hasten to add that I don't expect to understand or even perceive God's<br>
reasons for everything. But I still believe that there are reasons, and<br>
I will continue to try and dig out as much meaning as I can.<br>
<p>
As far as the ten commandments go, some of them have at least a <br>
superficial obvious motivation. It probably goes deeper as well, but<br>
for example "don't steal" is fairly easy to deal with.<br>
<p>
The fourth commandment is a little tougher. It is discussed in various<br>
places in the text, and in some of those places the motivation for the<br>
Sabbath is mentioned. It's not always the same: even in the comparison<br>
between the Exodus and Deuteronomy versions of the X, the explanation<br>
differs.<br>
<p>
So I try to pull out the essence of the thing, and I have a fair amount<br>
of difficulty. I have even more difficulty when I look at the way SDAs<br>
typically treat the Sabbath, because I don't think we always approach<br>
it properly.<br>
<p>
To give you some examples of the sorts of thoughts I sometimes have,<br>
consider the following self-debate.<br>
<p>
a. The sabbath is mainly a memorial of creation. As such it is important<br>
   that it be kept exactly 7n days after the original sabbath.<br>
<p>
b. That doesn't really make sense. Memorials of other things don't have<br>
   to be kept on exactly the same day. Take communion, easter, christmas...<br>
   sure, these don't appear in the X, and not everybody sees them as<br>
   valid memorials of the original events, but they still serve a <br>
   worthwhile purpose for me. Besides, Genesis 1 really does read more<br>
   like a cosmological polemic than an account of an actual week, and<br>
   if that's the case then that throws the historical-seven-day-cycle<br>
   thing, hey.<br>
<p>
a. Yes, well that's one good reason to see the creation story as a literal<br>
   account. There are other good reasons as well. Besides, why do you<br>
   think that you can understand all God's reasons? You may never really<br>
   understand the fourth commandment, but that's no reason to doubt its<br>
   validity.<br>
<p>
b. I agree on both points, which is why I have trouble with both items.<br>
   But don't you think there must be some human-related reason for the<br>
   sabbath? After all, it was made for man, Jesus said so himself. And<br>
   it was made for Earth, because it was the last act of creation.<br>
<p>
a. Well, one should always refer to the manufacturer's instructions, right?<br>
   God created man, and he said that we should rest on every seventh day.<br>
   People function best on a seven-day cycle. Other cycles have been tried,<br>
   but the seven-day one works best. God knew that, because he made us in<br>
   the first place.<br>
<p>
b. Ah, but then why does it matter which day the cycle starts on? Surely<br>
   if the seven-day-cycle is the important thing, we could choose any day<br>
   of the week that we like.<br>
<p>
a. That's where we just have to trust God. He said the "seventh day", and<br>
   he meant what is now Saturday. Who are we to arbitrarily change the<br>
   historical cycle?<br>
<p>
b. OK, but we certainly have to use a certain amount of human interpretation<br>
   when it comes to keeping the Sabbath worldwide. How about places where<br>
   the sun never sets or never rises? How about the fact that it's not<br>
   the same day everywhere at once? The fact is that the Bible reads as<br>
   though the earth is flat and the sun goes around it once a day. It <br>
   reads as though there is a dome above the ground holding off the waters<br>
   above, and that God sends the weather around like some omnipotent version<br>
   of Thor. We know that isn't really how it is. The original text was<br>
   written in a world without technology, drugs, pollution and a whole lot<br>
   of other things we deal with today.<br>
<p>
a. God gave us a mind, he gave us the Holy Spirit, and it's up to us to<br>
   use those God-given resources to discover his will in these areas.<br>
<p>
b. Yeah, well that's what this is all about, right??<br>
<p>
<p>
For those of you still reading, thanks. Please don't form a definite<br>
opinion on what I must be like from reading these posts I'm making.<br>
As you know yourselves, you can only express a few ideas at once when<br>
you're writing, so some of my statements are certainly wide open for<br>
total slaughter. But I have thought most of these things over fairly<br>
carefully, and I have reasons for the opinions I express - it's just<br>
that this post is already too long!<br>

The question is raised, when does the Sabbath begin and end if the<br>
sun never rises or sets, as in Alaska in the winter or summer.<br>
This puzzled me for a while.  Then the following idea occurred to<br>
me.  The logical time to begin/end the Sabbath is when the sun is<br>
closest to the horizon, either above the horizon at its lowest<br>
point or below the horizon at its highest point.  So in the<br>
summer the Sabbath would be from midnight to midnight if the sun<br>
did not set, and in the winter the Sabbath would be from noon to noon<br>
if the sun did not rise.  This is appealing because it makes the<br>
beginning and end of the Sabbath change continuously with ones<br>
position, if you think about it.<br>
<p>
In grey areas, I think that the Lord honors our best attempt to<br>
follow him.<br>

My own humble opinion is that renting a church out to a congregation is not<br>
a doctrinal issue.  It is one of convenience and perhaps meeting a need for<br>
both congregations.  The one renting out their building will receive needed<br>
money for their budget.  The other will have a place to worship until they<br>
can afford to buy or build their own.<br>
<p>
But there are issues that need to be seriously addressed if an SDA church is<br>
to rent out their facility to Sunday keepers of a practical nature.  For example,<br>
SDAs usually have their weddings on Sunday.  What happens to the Sunday-keeping<br>
congregation?  What will the wedding party do when they cannot have access to<br>
the church on Sunday morning for decorating and preparation because their<br>
renters are there?<br>
<p>
Another question.  SDAs schedule "work bees" for grounds clean-up on Sundays.<br>
If the church is rented out, can't have a work bee.<br>
<p>
What about occasional Sunday functions such as parties and social gatherings<br>
for the SDA congregation?  If the church is rented on Sunday mornings, be<br>
sure to stipulate exactly WHAT TIME the renters must be finished or you will<br>
find conflicts.  And, remember.  You can't schedule an pathfinder functions<br>
on Sunday morning.  Don't even plan to have young people meet in the parking<br>
lot Sunday morning to travel elsewhere.  The renting congregation will not<br>
appreciate it.<br>
<p>
So, ask these questions of the SDA congregation BEFORE you decide to rent.<br>
If all agree that they won't find the lack of flexibility and the inability<br>
to schedule anything for Sunday mornings, then go ahead.  But if your<br>
congreation has scheduled such things in the past, be sure you stipulate in<br>
the rental agreement exactly what hours the renters are allowed access to<br>
avoid problems in your own programs.<br>
<p>
That's my two cents.<br>
<p>

I have been watching this thread before I went on vacation last week (short one<br>
after some minor surgery) and then picked it up after I came back today.  I <br>
hope that what I say will be taken in the spirit that it is given.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Subject: Sabbath</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;On Mon, 7 Sep 1992 10:44:34 -0400 (EDT) you said:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;[The calendar history is well-known since the days of Julius Caesar,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;when the Julian Calendar was promulgated.  Since that point it has</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;been documented by any astronomical society you care to find that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the weekly cycle has not slipped a day.  Up to that point, there</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;were various communities of Jews, none of whom disagree on what day</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;is the Sabbath, even to this day, and some of them have been separated</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;(as in the case of those recently rescued from Ethiopia) for hundreds of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;years.  SCT]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  So the folks from Adam up until the Jews leaving Eygpt didn't mess up</i><br>
<i>&gt;the calendar even once?</i><br>
<p>
This is a non-arguement.  Even if the calendar was "messed up" and days were<br>
lost, there have been some fairly significant events that have set it<br>
straight.  Namely the exodus and the 1st advent of Jesus.  The 1st advent<br>
clearly points out that God knew that the Jews were worshipping on the proper<br>
day by what He did.  He is a deliberate God after all and He healed on the<br>
Sabbath to make a point.<br>
<p>
Besides that idea, if the Jews were worshipping on the wrong day, don't you<br>
think that He would have sent a prophet to make sure that the day was correct<br>
before the advent?  How could Jesus have made the points that He did if it was<br>
on the wrong day?  Do you honestly think that Jesus would have made any<br>
disciples if he openly broke the commandments?  How could Jesus be the perfect<br>
sacrifice if the law was not kept?  The Jews would have noticed if Jesus kept<br>
some other day as the sabbath.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;	Dave Plaisted</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The sad thing about most of the questions that have been put forth are that<br>
they question the motive of the Lord directly.  Slighting the majesty and<br>
knowledge that the Lord had BEFORE He gave the 10 commandments.<br>
<p>
Thinking as a man thinks is what Jesus wanted us NOT to do.  We conjure up all<br>
kinds of notions about what is right in an attempt to better our position<br>
before the Lord.  There is nothing we can do to change our position except<br>
accepting the sacrifice that Jesus made for us.  All of my sabbath-keeping<br>
doesn't change what I am.<br>
<p>
Pointing to a group of SDA's that keep Sunday because of a change in the<br>
international date line.  For shame.  Does the sun still rise and set?  Can <br>
you still count from one to seven?  The same can be done to YOU to.  There are<br>
radical sects within the Morman church that others use on a regular basis to<br>
bash Morman theology.  Let's get above the level that this discussion has<br>
dropped down to.<br>
<p>
There has not been enough "Thus sayeth the Lord..." in this discussion.  You<br>
claim that there is something in scripture that justifies your claim for<br>
Sunday-keeping, fine, show me.  I will do the same for Sabbath-keeping.<br>
<p>
To be sticking out our tongues and saying nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah does not<br>
belong on this network.<br>
<p>
Come on gang, we can do better......<br>

Russell,<br>
<p>
I'm afraid I have a confession to make.<br>
<p>
I am the one who brought up the thing about SDAs in Tonga. I myself an<br>
am SDA. I am not SDA-bashing, neither am I trying to suggest that the<br>
observance of the seventh-day sabbath is not important, or that it is<br>
non-biblical.<br>
<p>
Nor am I trying to question the majesty of God. The fact is that God<br>
has chosen to reveal himself (in the most part) through men, and *everything*<br>
we read in *any* written form has come through the work of men. We were<br>
created in his image, with a mind, which I presume he meant us to use. So<br>
doing our best to see the principles behind the law and other things in<br>
God's revelation, with the guidance of the Holy Spirit, shouldn't be <br>
classified as any form of rebellion. Quite the reverse!<br>
<p>
The founders of our denomination were renowned for their radical views, and<br>
that was because they dared to examine their beliefs and actions in the light<br>
of scripture. Quotations can be given (but not by me at the moment :) ) which<br>
say things to the effect of "the day we stop searching the scriptures and<br>
examining our beliefs is the day we stop growing spiritually", and other such<br>
things. EGW herself is strong on the idea of continuing to search for "truth".<br>
<p>
Those of us who are looking at the Bible, looking at our church, and trying<br>
to put the most into our spiritual lives and our religious families are not<br>
trying to buck the system. That is, unless the system says "the truth was<br>
discovered over 100 years ago, we've found it now, so let's stop looking for<br>
more<br>
<p>

It seems like there may be a nice little offshoot growing up here in <br>
Western PA.  Since I'm slated to work at a youth event next week with <br>
the pastor whose church it started in, and who is either a ringleader or <br>
an innocent bystander depending on whom you believe, I'll have more <br>
details soon.  <br>
<p>
So far all I know is that it begins with a deep study of the sanctuary<br>
and goes from there to holy flesh ideas, casting out demons, and anti-<br>
organizational issues.  The third has got the conference leadership involved.<br>
We are having a mini-campmeeting for this area next weekend, and we can <br>
expect to hear a lot from both sides.<br>
<p>
But I want to dwell briefly on the question of "translation faith" as it was <br>
first put forth by the "holy flesh" movement around 1900 and still crops<br>
up today.  The question is the following:  "Will the generation that is<br>
translated to heaven without seeing death at the end of time have a<br>
character any different than those who have died in Christ over the<br>
years?"<br>
<p>
Things that would seem to indicate NO:<br>
1) No transformation of character is made at the Second Coming (or is it)<br>
The things we take unchanged to heaven are our character and our friends.<br>
This means the millenium in heaven is a time of adjusting, learning to live<br>
with each other even in the absence of sin and temptation.  It's clear <br>
that not everyone taken to heaven will have completed the process of<br>
sanctification upon arrival.<br>
<p>
<p>
Things that would seem to indicate YES:<br>
1)  Those in the Bible that were translated (Enoch, Elijah, Jesus)<br>
were extraordinary men of God.<br>
2)  Ellen White's statements about God waiting for His character to <br>
be reproduced in His people before He comes.<br>
3)  The experimental fact that no one is persecuting us right now<br>
because we're not doing anything to deserve it.<br>
<p>
I think most of us would agree that in Christ, freedom from sin is <br>
possible.  The question is, is it necessary?<br>

1994 is the title of a book by Hal Camping which claims to have a <br>
prediction of the 2nd coming.  Rather than having us all going out <br>
and buy it, thus enriching him, why doesn't someone go to a bookstore<br>
and read it, find out what it says, and then let us know.<br>
<p>
(The chance that he is right is miniscule.  This is simply part of being<br>
wise as serpents, and knowing what is about to be thrown at us.)<br>

Although it is interesting to speculate on when one should begin the Sabbath<br>
North of the Arctic Circle--and this is a real problem for some SDAs--I am<br>
much more concerned that too often the meaning of the Sabbath is linked<br>
only to Creation.  <br>
<p>
I see the Sabbath as the most Christian of all Christian doctrines.  Let me<br>
tell you why.<br>
<p>
The Sabbath is a reminder of my Creator, so Exod 20:8.  And in John 1:3 we<br>
are told that through Christ "all things came into beingl?  Paul wrote the<br>
Colossians that Christ was preeminent because "in him all things were <br>
created" -- 1:16.<br>
<p>
The Sabbath is a reminder of the one who sanctifies me, my Lord who is in<br>
the process of making me holy as he is.  Exod 31:13-17 says the Sabbath is<br>
a sign of sanctification--of being set apart for a holy purpose, for special<br>
companionship with the one who makes me holy.  Keeping the Sabbath shows I<br>
am willing for Christ to make me holy, even as God is holy --Lev 11:45.  In<br>
the NT all three persons of the Godhead are involved in sanctification, but <br>
Paul tells the Corinthians that they have "been sanctified in Christ Jesus" <br>
--1 Cor 1:2.  Christ is sanctification to those who believe -- 1 Cor 1:30.<br>
<p>
The Sabbath reminds me of my Liberator.  Deut 5:15 shows the Sabbath as a<br>
sign of the liberation from Egypt.  The Israelites could celebrate freedom.<br>
I, too, celebrate on the Sabbath the freedom that Christ gives me.  See<br>
John 8:32-36.  On the Sabbath I celebrate the liberation, the ransom, the<br>
freedom from sin that Christ has made possible for me.<br>
<p>
The Sabbath brings to my attention the relation Christ wants between himself<br>
and me.  Ezek 20:20 says the Sabbath is a sign between God and his people--<br>
a sign that they are his.  This relation is expressed in more intimate terms<br>
in the Song of Songs: "I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine" --6:3.  In<br>
the OT, the relation is between the people and God.  In the NT, the individual<br>
relation is important.  Believers belong to Christ -- 1 Cor. 3:23.  The Sabbath<br>
is a sign of a close relation--between myself and my divine lover, who loved<br>
me so much that he gave his life for me.<br>
<p>
The Sabbath is a symbol of the rest that is mine--now as I walk this earth I<br>
have peace; then, in the glorious beyond, I will have eternal rest.  The rest<br>
motif appears in Heb 4.  It points back to the first Sabbath rest and the not-<br>
yet rest of the believer.  Christ said: "Come unto me and I will give you rest"<br>
-- Matt 11:28.  Each Sabbath day is a celebration of the peace and rest my<br>
Jesus provides for me.<br>
<p>
So you see why Sabbath is important to me.  The original blessings were for <br>
this day only.  The holy time is not transferable.  I gladly embrace the<br>
precious hours as a token of all the Christ is to me.<br>

Cheryl's question essentially asks:<br>
How can the scriptures be interpreting themselves if a [latter-day] prophet<br>
is used to interpret them instead?  <br>
This is a serious issue that got lost in a 40-message day.<br>
<p>
Alden Thompson stresses this in his book on Inspiration, in which he<br>
says  "If you want to understand the old testament, read the old testament,<br>
if you want to understand Matthew, read Matthew, and if you want to<br>
understand Ellen G. White, read Ellen G. White."  However, he goes on to <br>
point out that the New Testament has several places, particularly in the <br>
gospel of Matthew, where Matthew takes an Old Testament passage to mean <br>
something quite different than its original context.  So, though the practice <br>
may not be desirable, it has been with us since there have been commentators.<br>
<p>
The way to avoid the danger of "isogesis" (reading ones own meaning into<br>
the text) as opposed to "exegesis" (extracting the author's intent from<br>
the text,<br>
is to come to the Bible without an agenda.  Instead of trying to string <br>
together a string of texts to support our own ideas, we need to read the<br>
Bible and let it speak to us.<br>
<p>
If you study early SDA history you will find that this is what was done.<br>
The doctrines came from careful Bible study, not dictation from Ellen G.<br>
White.  But as a movement grows, people find it easier to hide behind the<br>
authority of a prophet than study out the truth for themselves.  Probably<br>
the reason why there hasn't been more than one prophet in the SDA church<br>
is that one has given those people who use the club of authority all the <br>
ammunition they need from now until the end of time.  And those who<br>
ignore her wouldn't listen to other ones anyway.<br>

Scott raised an issue with the Epistle to the Magnesians,<br>
claiming it was both earlier and more Sunday-keeping than <br>
I had ever heard of before.  Somebody posted on it, but<br>
I don't think they answered Scott's point.  <br>
Does someone have Bacchiocchi's book _From Sabbath To Sunday?_<br>
This reference is certainly covered there, but I don't have <br>
one handy.  Help on this reference would be much appreciated.<br>

Tony,<br>
<p>
First, I can sympathize with your internal debate over the Sabbath.  I<br>
have my own internal debates concerning some of the other Adventists'<br>
beliefs.  I have these debate as I want to have knowledge of the truth.  I<br>
want to be that kind of person that continually searches for the truth. <br>
Many times I have come to study one of our doctrines only to have<br>
questions arise.  These questions impel me to study the scriptures and<br>
find answers to firm up my what I consider the beliefs that I on one level<br>
ascribe to.  For example, concerning the Sabbath and the belief that in<br>
1844 Jesus began the investigative judgment, I answered many of my<br>
questions and at this point accepting those beliefs on a far deeper level<br>
than before.  Many of the questions you bring up about the Sabbath aren't<br>
ones I have ever dealt with before.  Correct me if I am wrong, but they<br>
seems to be mostly ones that deal with how the Sabbath pans out in<br>
practice.  I am not sure how to answer them.  My questions are more of a<br>
theological/interpretive fair.  One of my lastest quandries has to do with<br>
whether the New Jerusalem is really in heaven during the Millenium.  I<br>
have not rejected the Adventist view, but I do question it.  Which brings<br>
me to my next message for SDAnet...<br>

<i>&gt; 1994 is the title of a book by Hal Camping which claims to have a </i><br>
<i>&gt; prediction of the 2nd coming.  Rather than having us all going out </i><br>
<i>&gt; and buy it, thus enriching him, why doesn't someone go to a bookstore</i><br>
<i>&gt; and read it, find out what it says, and then let us know.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Steve Timm</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
     Author:  Harold Camping<br>
      Title:  1994<br>
  Publisher:  Vantage Press<br>
Distributor:  Baker &amp; Taylor<br>
       ISBN:  0-533-10368-1<br>
       Cost:  $14.95<br>
<p>
I have the book on order and should get it in a few days.  However, I<br>
am a terribly slow reader, and _1994_ is a sizable book (&gt;500 pages).<br>
If you want timely and varied feedback, I suggest several mature<br>
Christians read it.  Don't worry about making Mr. Camping rich.  He<br>
does not claim any special revalation from God.  He bases his<br>
conclusion on a careful exegesis of the Bible.  He goes (I believe)<br>
rather heavily into numerology.<br>
<p>
Resist the impulse to slam him.  I have no doubt that he is a true<br>
believer.  His defense of the Bible as the word of God is powerful.<br>
He did not want to write this book.  He did not want to draw such<br>
attention to his ministry.  But believing as he did, he was compelled;<br>
wouldn't you be?  The worst you could say is that he is deluded, and<br>
you shouldn't say that until you have read the book, hence, my order.<br>
On the other side of the coin, if he is right, he has an urgent message<br>
to proclaim, one to be sure that is already written:<br>
<p>
2 Corinthians chapter 6<br>
  1 We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that<br>
ye receive not the grace of God in vain.<br>
  2 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in<br>
the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the<br>
accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)<br>
<p>
<p>
God bless,<br>

Tony, &amp; Network<br>
<p>
Hi Tony, <br>
<p>
Yes I am a pastor and I cannot remember any church members being uptight<br>
about eating meat. Usually our members feel that it is a personal decision<br>
on the part of the individual. When I take Adventists out for a meal, I<br>
usually try to clear the air by telling them to order what ever they<br>
would like.<br>
<p>
I have been mentoring a ministerial intern who pastor's a neighboring<br>
church and we get together once a month for a meal. In the beginning I<br>
asked him if he was a vegetarian so I would better know which restaurant<br>
to take him to. Incidently Crabs, Oysters, seafood in general is the big<br>
thing here on the eastern shore of Maryland. We frequent a restaurant<br>
called the Blue Crab! The cook makes a vegetable lasagna that in my<br>
opinion is excellent!!<br>
<p>
Anyway, hope I have answered your question.<br>
<p>
........Paul<br>
<p>
I very rarely ever eat meat -- perhaps a corn beef sandwich if I can not<br>
find anythingelse to eat, but that is very rarely done by me. So I think<br>
of myself as a vegetarian because 95-99% of the time that is the case.<br>
<p>
I do not believe eating meat is a sin. I may have eluded to it in my<br>
previous post, I do not eat meat on a regular basis because of the disease<br>
and fat content.<br>
<p>
BTW, check with McDonald's  on their chicken mcnuget sandwiches. I<br>
understand that most if not all of the meat is from vegetable protein. It<br>
would be interesting to really know.<br>
<p>
.......Paul<br>
<p>
<p>
For many years we had the policy that no meat in lunches of children in<br>
grade school (church school). Bad or good this is how we are handling it<br>
today. We have quite a few non-Adventist parents -- We have a<br>
recommendation in the school handbook that the teachers would prefer the<br>
students not bring meat in their lunches and the teachers do not allow<br>
students to trade lunches. The problem was that students were trading<br>
lunches and some parents who did not want their children to eat meat were<br>
doing so by trading.<br>
<p>
[Paul is signed off the net for about a month, so any responses to this<br>
or his other threads should be by E-mail to him.  SCT]<br>

Hi all,,<br>
<p>
Cheryl asks  :<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Would you mind giving me a few scriptures that support the idea that</i><br>
<i>&gt; God's Law is intended to portray or symbolize His character?  thank you.</i><br>
<p>
Ok thats fairly easy to do. We can do this by looking at God's character<br>
<p>
God is :<br>
<p>
eternal		Ps 45:6<br>
righteous	Ezra 9:15<br>
perfect		Matt 5:48<br>
holy		Lev 19:2<br>
good		Ps 34:8<br>
truth		Deut 32:4<br>
unchanging/immutable	Ecc 3:14 / Mal 3:6<br>
<p>
Now we know htat the law is a revelation of God's will, what are its<br>
characteristics, <br>
<p>
God's Law is :<br>
<p>
eternal		Ps 111:8<br>
righteous	Ps 119:172<br>
perfect		Ps 19:7<br>
holy		Rom 7:12<br>
good		Rom 7:12<br>
truth		Ps 119:142<br>
unchanging/immutable	MAtt 5:17-18<br>
<p>
So we see they have the same character. We can also do this comparison <br>
another way. We know that one becomes like the thing one spends time <br>
comtemplating : by beholding we become changed. So what was it that <br>
JEsus comtinously contemplated - God's law Ps (40:6-8) We also<br>
know that character can be defined as ones feelings + ones actions<br>
well we know what Christ's feelings and actions were MAtt 5:17-18, <br>
John 15:10, He loved and kept God's law perfectly.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I appreciated your analysis of God's Law versus The Law of Moses.  However,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I fail to see how the fact that God gave the law to Moses to give to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Isrealites would render it Moses's law rather than God's Law.  If God</i><br>
<i>&gt; gave it (directly or indirectly), is it not still from God?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Well as you saw one was publicaly given to the entire nation personally<br>
by God and written by His own hand. The other was given to the Levites<br>
by Moses who wrote it with his hand. God chose to make this very LARGE<br>
distinction Himself, why do you think He did this for ? Nobody denies<br>
that both laws originated from God but I am sure you do not fail to<br>
note the preminence given to the Decalogue by God himself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; other words, "Thou shalt not kill unless I direct you to do so because</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are a wicked nation."  Did the Isrealites break God's Law when they</i><br>
<i>&gt; murdered and killed innocent women and children at His direction?</i><br>
<p>
I am sorry but I must disagree with you here. No one that God commanded to<br>
be killed was innocent.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If it is God's Law, does He have authority to change it?  (I'm not asking</i><br>
<i>&gt;IF He would change it?)  If He has the authority to change it and a</i><br>
<i>&gt;Christian bases his/her belief on a Sunday Sabbath on a direct command</i><br>
<i>&gt;given to an individual whom they accept and believe is a prophet of God,</i><br>
<i>&gt;then doesn't that Christian have a basis for accepting a changed Sabbath</i><br>
<i>&gt;day?</i><br>
<p>
Nope, because that would make God a liar, and it is impossible for God<br>
to lie. (Heb 6:18)<br>
<p>
Ps 89:34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of <br>
         my lips. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Matt 5:17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am <br>
          not come to destroy, but to fulfil. (KJV) <br>
Matt 5:18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or <br>
          one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be <br>
          fulfilled. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Eze 20:12 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and <br>
          them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.  <br>
 <br>
Eze 20:20 And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, <br>
          that ye may know that I am the LORD your God. (KJV) <br>
 <br>
Ecc 12:13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep <br>
          his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. (KJV) <br>
 <br>
<p>
"Ye are my witnesses saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen:<br>
that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me<br>
there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me." Is 43:10<br>
<p>
"Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts;<br>
I am the first and I am the last; and beside me there is no God." Is 44:6<br>

Nancy,<br>
<p>
the way you approach the Sabbath is very constructive, and in my opinion<br>
the Sabbath is important for all the reasons you listed. Jesus makes those<br>
points well with the Sabbath miracles and so on.<br>
<p>
You go on to say that the "holy time is not transferable". This must lead<br>
you to be very concerned about whether or not you are observing the correct<br>
24-hour period.<br>
<p>
I myself am not so sure about the holy time thing. Consider the case of<br>
the date-line thing in Tonga. Now that the weekday names have been changed,<br>
normal Sunday-keeping churches worship on the same day as SDAs. Would you<br>
consider that the benefits of Sabbath would now be available to Sunday-<br>
keepers whereas before they weren't? I know many people who worship on<br>
Sunday don't observe a Sabbath then the way we do, but treat that <br>
separately for now.<br>
<p>
Personally, I would *like* to think that God is able to bless us anyway,<br>
depending mainly on our own attitude to him, to worship and to life. I am<br>
not convinced that this *is* the case, but I'd like to think it is.<br>
<p>
Perhaps a good experiment would be to have groups of people keeping Friday,<br>
Saturday and Sunday. Making the assumption that one of these days is blessed<br>
more than the others, we would only need to develop a spiritual meter rule<br>
and we could discover which one it is. ;)<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; Things that would seem to indicate NO:</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) No transformation of character is made at the Second Coming (or is it)</i><br>
<p>
thats right because that change has to happen in our lives now. <br>
Why do you think the Lord has been delaying his comming ? <br>
Could it be because we are not ready to meet Him ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Things that would seem to indicate YES:</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1)  Those in the Bible that were translated (Enoch, Elijah, Jesus)</i><br>
<i>&gt; were extraordinary men of God.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2)  Ellen White's statements about God waiting for His character to </i><br>
<i>&gt; be reproduced in His people before He comes.</i><br>
<p>
Shouldn't this be enough evidence ?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3)  The experimental fact that no one is persecuting us right now</i><br>
<i>&gt; because we're not doing anything to deserve it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think most of us would agree that in Christ, freedom from sin is </i><br>
<i>&gt; possible.  The question is, is it necessary?</i><br>
<p>
Christ came to save us from SIN. MAtt 1:21<br>
have we really been saved unless we have been saved from sin ?<br>
Are you asking whether salvation from sin is necessary ?<br>

After being questioned by postmillenialist concerning my views on the<br>
millenium, I came upon some questions of my own concerning the Adventist<br>
position that the New Jerusalem will not be on the earth during the<br>
millenium.  My first question is this:  historically where does this<br>
position come from?  In other words, did the early Adventists first hold<br>
this position or did they accept after studying it from someone else?  Now<br>
my second question comes after I give a brief overview of what I see and<br>
don't see within Revelations verses about the millenium.<br>
<p>
Revelation 19:17-21 appears to indicate the 2nd coming (this goes along<br>
with Paul's statements in II Thess. 2).<br>
<p>
Revelation 20:1-3 shows Satan being bound for 1,000 years so he can't<br>
deceive (this is typical portrayed as the time in which Satan is alone on<br>
a desolate earth.  It is argued that the bottomless pit refers to this. <br>
Also, verses from Isaiah and Jeremiah are alluded to as supporting this. <br>
Now I can see that the verses in Isaiah 24 might refer to this time, but I<br>
have trouble seeing how taking those verse in Jeremiah 4 to refer to the<br>
millenium doesn't render them out of context.)<br>
<p>
Revelation 20:4-6  Righteous reign with Jesus and it is noted that the<br>
righteous are resurrected (this meets up with Paul in I Thess. 4:13-17<br>
where it is clearly shown that the saints meet Jesus in the air; it makes<br>
no mention about Jesus stepping on the earth).  The righteous judge, whel<br>
the rest of the dead sleep until the end of the thousand years.  No where<br>
in these verses does it say where everyone is.  Are they on the earth or<br>
in heaven?<br>
<p>
Revelation 20:7-10  Satan deceives again.  Note that the city and the<br>
saint are portrayed in these verses as being upon the earth.  Were they<br>
already there during the millenium or did they just arrive?  It doesn't<br>
say here, it only says that when Satan is loosed and the wicked are<br>
gathered to attack that the city and saints are on the earth (some<br>
Adventists point to Zech. 14:4,5 as describing the return of Jesus with<br>
his saints at the end of the millenium, but can this be done without<br>
taking this verse out of context?  Also, the usual interpretation takes<br>
Revelation 21:2 and then refers it to John seeing the holy city descending<br>
at the end of the millenium, but I question this interpretive move and<br>
will note my question in a second).  It should also be noted that these<br>
verses speak of the wicked being consumed and the Devil being placed in<br>
the lake of fire.<br>
<p>
Revelation 20:11-15  This brings up imagery similar to Daniel's portrayal<br>
of the Ancient of Days.  Here the dead are before the throne and the<br>
books.  Death, Hades, and the unrighteous go into the lake of fire/second<br>
death.  Seeing as how we just saw the wicked consumed, it seems reasonable<br>
to say that this is an expansion of the events in the last few verses.<br>
<p>
Revelation 21:1-8  Verse 1 says there is a new heaven and a new earth. <br>
Verse 2 shows the New Jerusalem coming down out of heaven.  After this<br>
follow comments on this new situation (Now if the verses from chapter 19<br>
and the the verses from chapter 20 are taken to be somewhat<br>
sequential--excepting the expansion on the fate of the wicked-- then why<br>
should verse 2 not be seen as sequential with verse 1?  This is my<br>
question concerning the usage of the 2nd verse to refer to the end of the<br>
millenium.)  <br>
<p>
Now given all the verses above I see a few possibilites:<br>
scenario 1:  Jesus meets saints in the air and they go to the heavenly<br>
city which then lands on the desolate earth.  After the millenium, when<br>
the wicked are destroyed, the city rises from the earth.  After the new<br>
heaven and the new earth it rests again on the earth.  I should note<br>
something that I forgot to mention above:  when the wicked are consumed<br>
fire comes out of heaven, which makes one wonder if God isn't in the air<br>
when he destroys the unrighteous.  This brings up a further question: <br>
when it says the wicked lay seige to the saints and the city does that<br>
necessitate that the city is on the earth?  Which suggests another<br>
possibility...<br>
<p>
Scenario 2: Jesus and the saints go to the New Jerusalem that does not<br>
exist upon the earth at the moment.  After the millenium, when the wicked<br>
are destroyed, the city approachs the earth such that the wicked are able<br>
to at least see it.  The judgement's last phase is preformed and the earth<br>
and heaven are made new.  Then the city descends.<br>
<p>
Scenario 3: Jesus and the saints go to the New Jerusalem that does not<br>
exist upon the earth at the moment.  After the millenium, when the wicked<br>
are destroyed, the city descends upon the earth. Then the city rises after<br>
the final acts of judgment are done and fire rains down to consume the<br>
wicked.  The heavens and earth are made new.  The city descends again.<br>
<p>
Now none of these is what I consider the usual Adventist position on the<br>
millenium and New Jerusalem.<br>
<p>
Now I know some verses like John 14:1-3 are used to support the notion that<br>
the saints are not on the earth in any way during the millenium.  I see<br>
this as potentially ok.  Now comes my second and it seems my third questions.<br>
<p>
Are there other verses to support the idea that the New Jerusalem will not<br>
be on the earth during the millenium?<br>
<p>
Given any answers to this, are there comments on what else I said such<br>
that I might figure out which view is right concerning the sequence of<br>
events (scenarios 1-3, and the usual Adventist view which doesn't include<br>
the reascent and redescent of scenario 3).<br>
<p>
Whew!  This is a lot of stuff!<br>
<p>
Thanks for any help in figuring out my dilemmas,<br>

ME:<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I think most of us would agree that in Christ, freedom from sin is </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; possible.  The question is, is it necessary?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Christ came to save us from SIN. MAtt 1:21</i><br>
<i>&gt;have we really been saved unless we have been saved from sin ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are you asking whether salvation from sin is necessary ?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Ruben.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, this is exactly the question I am asking.  In times past on this list<br>
I have been so bold as to answer it *NO*.  But now I am rethinking my<br>
position.  The difficulty for me is trying to reconcile all the verses<br>
in the<br>
Bible that say it is easy to be saved with the requirements on us during <br>
the time of trouble.  When I read the Bible, I read such verses as<br>
"Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved" and<br>
"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved."  <br>
<p>
So salvation in my mind is an important first step, but not a<br>
time-consuming one that should occupy our whole Christian experience to<br>
the day of our death.  It's a free gift that we should receive and build<br>
our relationship with Christ on that basis.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that everyone begins a walk with Christ at salvation and<br>
proceeds down the road to sanctification.  But not everyone has a chance<br>
to <br>
complete this walk and come to full sanctification by the time they die.  <br>
The thief on the cross provides the classic example, but he is only one of<br>
many who will have some real learning to do once he gets to heaven.<br>
<p>
Yet I strongly believe that there will be a sanctified people at the end<br>
of time, sanctification which is complete by the time of trouble.  What<br>
this means to me is a group of people who will love God supremely and<br>
their <br>
neighbor as themselves ("Loving God supremely and your neighbor as yourself<br>
is genuine sanctification"--EGW)  This unconditional love displayed to<br>
those who have rejected it will infuriate them and bring about<br>
persecution and the time of trouble.<br>
<p>
So I suppose the question is:  Will everyone who is translated to heaven<br>
without seeing death be part of the above group?  Is it fair to identify <br>
the above group as the 144000  (Something Ellen G. White refused to do when <br>
asked a specific question on that topic)?<br>

This 1994 date for the Second Coming is not new.  We had a professor in the<br>
Philippines teach it in his Bible classes.  He got it from the 6000 years<br>
beginning with Usher's 4004 chronology.  Several of his students quit school<br>
and went out to an isolated village where they had a day and night retreat,<br>
preparing to go out and preach.  After a few months most of them quietly<br>
came back.  The professor decided that since the board told him to desist <br>
from promulgating his views or cease receiving a salary, he would change his<br>
mind.  Just a story...<br>

The Epistle to the Magnesians was written by Ignatius of Antioch, early in the<br>
second century.  The passage in question is 9.1<br>
<p>
What makes the passage difficult is that different editions of the letter read<br>
differently.  Most read: no longer sabbatizing but living according to the <br>
"lordly".  One MS reads "no longer sabbatizing but living according to the<br>
lordly life--meaning the Lord's life."<br>
<p>
First problem: Sabbatizing.  The verb is used by other early church fathers to<br>
refer to "judaizing"--living like Jews.  It may or may not refer specifically<br>
to observing the seventh-day Sabbath.  <br>
<p>
Second problem:  The adjective "lordly" has no noun.  Lordly what?  Lordly day?<br>
Lordly life?   Since the adjective is in the feminine, we have to think of<br>
feminine nouns.  The two most commonly suggested are day and life.  The same<br>
adjective is used, without a noun, in Rev 1:10.  So was John in vision on the<br>
lordly day?  If so, which was that?  The emperor's day?  Christ's day? And if it<br>
was Christ's day, was that Sabbath or Sunday?<br>
<p>
Sunday observance came in very early in some places, mostly as an attempt by<br>
Christians to dissociate themselves from Judaism.  In part this was a natural<br>
reaction to persecution.  Jews were persecuted; they did not want the same fate.So they became different from Jews--and the Sabbath was a good symbol, so it <br>
went easily in some areas.<br>
<p>
As to what day the lordly day of Rev 1:10 is, one must follow the principle of<br>
unity of Scripture.  What does the rest of the Bible say on the day of rest?<br>
If we believe Scripture does not contradict itself, we cannot examine only one<br>
verse, although that is where we will start.<br>
<p>
I trust you will all have a blessed Sabbath, full of the promised gifts.<br>

Here is a similar issue which may help us sort out the original one.<br>
<p>
Enoch was translated to heaven without dying, and well before the<br>
sacrifice of Christ. I have tried real hard to find references which<br>
answer the question "Did Jesus die for Enoch?" and to this point have<br>
been unable to. The Bible only has about one verse on the topic, and<br>
EGW has less than a page.<br>
<p>
Reading the text at face value would seem to indicate that Enoch's<br>
relationship with Jesus was enough. Does this contradict the doctrine<br>
of salvation by faith? Does Enoch's "walking with God" constitute the<br>
faith required? But faith in what - Jesus hadn't died yet. Or are <br>
salvation by faith and salvation by achieving perfection both<br>
legitimate alternatives?<br>
<p>
My gut reaction is to reject the entire holy flesh concept, including<br>
the translation faith variant. I instinctively reject anything which<br>
implies that God's favour can be earned. At the same time I'm not<br>
sure that the Biblical record supports my instincts on this one!<br>

Steve,<br>
  You are right and I apologize for asking for such  a big favor. I will<br>
drop out of all SDAnet discussions until I get my Internet connection back.<br>
One SDAer gave me a lead on a cheap alternate method, so I will explore that<br>
possibility.<br>
  Please pass this on to SDAnet so everone knows why I am not continuing the<br>
Sabbath discussion.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
Tony writes :<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Enoch was translated to heaven without dying, and well before the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sacrifice of Christ. I have tried real hard to find references which</i><br>
<i>&gt; answer the question "Did Jesus die for Enoch?" and to this point have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been unable to. The Bible only has about one verse on the topic, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; EGW has less than a page.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Yes Jesus did die for Enoch because we are told that "All have sinned"<br>
Enoch's translation was only possible because of the Lamb that Revelation<br>
tells us "was slain from the foundation of the world"<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; My gut reaction is to reject the entire holy flesh concept, including</i><br>

<i>&gt; sure that the Biblical record supports my instincts on this one!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
before we through anything out we must understand it to ensure we<br>
are not throwing away a jewel encrusted within dirt.<br>
<p>
What exactly are you refering to as the Holy Flesh concept ?<br>
<p>
In EGW's day it meant that one could attain such a state as that<br>
in would be impossible for him/her to sin, ie that the carnal nature<br>
was replaced by a divine nature even while on this earth, at no<br>
particular time and so henceforth they were holy in their own right.<br>
<p>
Let me just say that I have never heard anybody teach or suggest<br>
this concept in my lifetime (it not that long) within the SDA church. <br>
That does not say someone may not<br>
believe it, but I am totally unaware of it. What I do know of<br>
is people coming to wrong conclusions regarding valid doctrines<br>
and labelling them "holy flesh"; this being an easy way to discourage others<br>
from studying for themselves.<br>
<p>
The point of overcoming all sin in ones life has nothing at all to do<br>
with earning God's grace. Instead it has everything to do with God's<br>
grace working in one's life so fully that in every thought, word and<br>
act one simply reflects Christ image. Do we love God enough to permit <br>
Him to so transform our lives ? or are we content to continue <br>
dishonouring God with our petty (somtimes) sins. Those who truely have <br>
the saving faith - constant dependance on God's saving grace - "the faith<br>
of Jesus" will live a life in complete conformity to that which Jesus lived<br>
while on earth. Was He not our example ? Do we not have recourse to the<br>
same power to overcome sin that He had while on this earth ? was He not <br>
tempted in all point such as we are ? <br>
<p>
Living a life that is pleasing to God has nothing at ALL to do with earning<br>
His favor, it has everything to do with how much we love Jesus and wish<br>
to please Him and what gratitude we have for all that He has done for us.<br>
<p>
Do we love God enough to please Him in all that we say and do ?<br>
God is able and willing to empower us to live to His honour are we<br>
willing to take up the challenge ?<br>
<p>

Does anybody know what kind of research has been made with creation<br>
in our universities?  I read one book (finnish writer) concerning<br>
talking between evolution and creation.  There were also talking about<br>
Genesis and what those first verses means when you read them 'as is'.<br>
Only sabbath wasn't mentioned anymore...<br>
<p>
Are there good books which you can recomend?  <br>

Steve,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; All right:  I've bared my soul to the net, now it's your turn.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are people who have been subscribed to the net since the beginning,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I don't even know their names.  Let's speak out.</i><br>
<p>
Hmmm, somehow I get the idea people are shy about telling about themselves.<br>
I think it's a neat idea, but guess I'm shy about it too.  Any ideas on<br>
building<br>
a more open net?  One that would make people feel less shy?<br>
<p>
Just wondering,<br>
Lisa<br>

Lisa Parry thinks people may be shy.  I can think of two other<br>
reasons that we might not be seeing responses on this thread.<br>
<p>
1)  People are too busy, lazy, or apathetic to respond.<br>
<p>
2)  People are trying to respond to the messages that are tagged SDA-L<br>
and they are bouncing back.<br>
<p>
For the latter, unless you have signed on to SDA-L by sending a message<br>
directly to LISTSERV@LLUVM.Bitnet saying SUB SDA-L YOURNAME<br>
you can't respond directly to those messages.  (Once you do, you will<br>
get double copies of all SDA-L messages until you SET SDA-L NOMAIL).<br>
<p>
What you should do, if you're not subscribed, is send your response to<br>
these threads to me, with SDA-L in the subject line, I will forward it.<br>
<p>
But I think Lisa is right.  There are some 30 people who have never<br>
posted a thing from the time they signed on to SDAnet or SDA-L.  We need<br>
to create an environment where they feel free to post.<br>
<p>
Ideas are welcome.<br>

My name is Ian Robertson Brown, I go by the computer name of Malachi<br>
Robertson as someone already was using 'Ian Brown' as a login name.<br>
<p>
I am currently a student at the University of Iowa.  I am planning to<br>
graduate next spring with a B.S. in economics.  After that I hope to go to<br>
Andrews and study religion (quite a change from economics!  You should<br>
have seen the blank stare on my advisors face when I told him I might go<br>
to seminary.).<br>
<p>
I became a Seventh-day Adventist after a series of meetings conducted by<br>
Amazing Facts here at the university.  I have been a church member since<br>
1989.  Before that I was a believer in a god, but no specific religious<br>
persuasion.  I am currently working with my fellow church members to start<br>
a campus organization.<br>
<p>
My hobbies include reading, interacting on the computer, and ocassionally<br>
playing the piano.<br>
<p>
I am 21 and lived 18 of those years in Houston, Texas.  I moved to Iowa<br>
for the climate and for the good economics program.  I also have relatives<br>
near by which doesn't hurt.  I am a single guy living with two married<br>
couples in a large apartment in Coralville, Iowa, which is right next door<br>
to Iowa City and the university.<br>
<p>
I will add that I am glad to be a follower of our Lord Jesus Christ, and a<br>
member of the group of followers to whom he has given much truth.  May we<br>
gladly serve him by teaching the truth to others and by continually searching<br>
for more.<br>

I've been on both sides of the renting church issue, meaning I've been<br>
 in a congregation where we rented our building to another denomination<br>
on Sunday, and I've experienced having to rent another church for our<br>
services on Sabbath.<br>
<p>
Cheryl's comments about hammering all the details out ahead of time are<br>
very apt.  When we rented for Sabbath we were sometimes turned out with<br>
only a week's notice because there was going to be a wedding.  Or there<br>
would be kids running in and out of the building because the other<br>
church had a youth trip and they were meeting in the parking lot before<br>
leaving.  That kind of thing can be terribly disturbing to your service.<br>
<p>
As for renting the SDA building, I never had any qualms about it.  I<br>
viewed it as helping out another group of Christian brothers and sisters.<br>
And because I was on the committee to find a place to rent for ourselves,<br>
I know how difficult it can be to find a church that is willing to<br>
share space!  Plus, the income did wonderful things for our budget, even<br>
though we charged barely over what it cost us to keep the utilities on<br>
for the extra days per month.<br>
<p>
The cleaning issue was always the most troublesome.  As SDAs we didn't<br>
want to have our janitor clean after church on Sabbath for the Sunday<br>
group, nor did we want any of them coming in Sabbath afternoon to clean.<br>
That left Saturday night or Sunday morning early.  We finally solved it<br>
by agreeing to pick up as much as possible after church on Sabbath<br>
without actually cleaning, and the Sunday people would just not fuss if<br>
there was stuff on the carpet or a fingerprint or two on the woodwork.<br>

The young adults of western Pennsylvania were treated to a listening<br>
session.  Ron Wisbey and Dick Duerksen, president and vice president of <br>
the union, respectively were there, as well as Jerry Page and Don Baker,<br>
president and youth leader of the Penn. Conference.  We met at a Howard<br>
Johnson's, they paid for lunch and didn't even ask for money.<br>
<p>
About 18 people attended this session.  The previous day they had<br>
130 some in Eastern PA.<br>
<p>
The format was to consist of first caucusing in groups to figure out what are<br>
the major high points and low points in the church today, then the last<br>
part came up to what are we going to do about it.  <br>
<p>
Throughout the process the leaders all seemed very receptive and <br>
eager to make changes.  The bottom line, of course, is that there is nothing<br>
that a union administration or conference administration can do to<br>
activate a congregation, it has to come from the grass roots.  They<br>
wanted to see <br>
what resources they could provide to facilitate the process.<br>
<p>
In another post I'll cover some of the main points that were brought up.<br>
But as a side effect of this meeting, we could be seeing Dick Duerksen on <br>
SDAnet in a couple weeks.<br>

<i>&gt;Subject: Re: Translation faith</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Here is a similar issue which may help us sort out the original one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Enoch was translated to heaven without dying, and well before the</i><br>
<i>&gt;sacrifice of Christ. I have tried real hard to find references which</i><br>
<i>&gt;answer the question "Did Jesus die for Enoch?" and to this point have</i><br>
<i>&gt;been unable to. The Bible only has about one verse on the topic, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;EGW has less than a page.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Reading the text at face value would seem to indicate that Enoch's</i><br>
<i>&gt;relationship with Jesus was enough. Does this contradict the doctrine</i><br>
<i>&gt;of salvation by faith? Does Enoch's "walking with God" constitute the</i><br>
<i>&gt;faith required? But faith in what - Jesus hadn't died yet. Or are </i><br>
<i>&gt;salvation by faith and salvation by achieving perfection both</i><br>
<i>&gt;legitimate alternatives?</i><br>
<p>
No they are not.  We are incapable of achieving perfection by ourselves.  Only<br>
by beholding the One sent to be sin for us can we be changed.  This is why <br>
James says that the law is like a man who looks into a mirror, sees himself<br>
for what he is and then goes away and forgets what he actually looks like.  The<br>
law or the keeping of the law cannot and will not save us. (See Romans and <br>
Galations on this one...:-)<br>
<p>
As far as Enoch being saved by works, examine Heb 11.  There you will see that<br>
Jesus died for Enoch also.  You see that the inspired writer says, "By faith<br>
Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because<br>
God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that <br>
he pleased God.  [Now, if we stop here your arguement has some weight.  But,<br>
if we read the next verse the weight vanishes. - REG] 6 - But without faith it<br>
is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is<br>
and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."<br>
<p>
The entire 11th chapter of Hebrews tells the story of salvation before Jesus.<br>
It was the same then as it is now, faith saves, actions do not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My gut reaction is to reject the entire holy flesh concept, including</i><br>
<i>&gt;the translation faith variant. I instinctively reject anything which</i><br>
<i>&gt;implies that God's favour can be earned. At the same time I'm not</i><br>
<i>&gt;sure that the Biblical record supports my instincts on this one!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Your instincts regarding faith are correct.  Only faith saves, actions merely<br>
show that faith exists (if you love Me, keep My commandments).<br>
<p>
Most of the holy flesh movement really circles around the very nature of the<br>
Messiah when He came to be among us.  Was He just like you and I?  Or was He<br>
like a second Adam?  This is the really critical question.  Be careful how you<br>
answer it.  Be careful how you use the Bible and SoP quotations on this.  What<br>
may appear to serve one end actually may serve the other when taken in<br>
context.<br>

I am sometimes shy, but the main reason I haven't written any personal<br>
interest stuff for the net is because I am married.<br>
<p>
Now, I may have misread the initial posts regarding this, but I have<br>
gotten the impression that this was some kind of SDA dating service.<br>
Of course, I didn't feel that my biography would be of much interest,<br>
considering that I live so far away from most of you (g'day Ruben)<br>
and that my fate is sealed.<br>
<p>
Please correct me if I have misunderstood the situation!<br>

Does anybody know what kind of research has been made with creation<br>
in our universities?  I read one book (finnish writer) concerning<br>
talking between evolution and creation.  There were also talking about<br>
Genesis and what those first verses means when you read them 'as is'.<br>
Only sabbath wasn't mentioned anymore...<br>
<p>
Are there good books which you can recomend?  <br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
I have a friend who is a science lecturer at Avondale College who<br>
has made it his business to read widely on this topic. Give me<br>
a couple of days and I will get a list of references from him.<br>
Any pointers on which particular slant you may be interested in?<br>
(Most angles are represented somewhere in the literature!)<br>

[Remember creation/evolution is officially a "banned topic" on SDAnet.<br>
I will let this post continue for right now but reserve the right to <br>
cut it off arbitrarily if the discussion gets out of hand.  SCT]<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
I had no idea! It's probably a good thing - a lot of bandwidth could<br>
potentially be wasted on this topic. I think it is an important topic,<br>
but it's easy enough to be misunderstood on this one when speaking to<br>
someone face to face!<br>

When I asked people to post biographies, it was not my major intention to<br>
turn SDA-L into a dating service.  Married people as well as single<br>
should post biographies.  You notice on my list of priorities meeting<br>
young women was third, after finding a job and something else.<br>
Being acquainted with the demographics of the list as I am, I think it<br>
rather unlikely that anyone will ever answer such a personal ad, and I<br>
don't expect people to.<br>
<p>
So, everyone, please speak up.  Especially you 30 or so SDAnet people<br>
that have never posted a thing since you got on.<br>
<p>
If you got a double copy of Tony's message, BTW, that's my fault.<br>
Nothing wrong with the net.<br>

Some of the things that we agreed we were pleased with in the church:<br>
<p>
1)  That the church was listening to young adults, as evidenced by the session.<br>
<p>
2)  That we have the right message for the time.<br>
<p>
3)  That we are beginning to realize what it means to be involved in our<br>
community.<br>
<p>
4)  The wide range of educational opportunities that are available<br>
<p>
Some of the troubles that our group of young adults agreed were the major <br>
problems in the church to us:<br>
<p>
1)  Diluting our message to blend in with the world.<br>
<p>
2)  The education gap between college-educated and not, and the difficulty<br>
of constructing a church to appeal to both.<br>
<p>
3)  The problem of separate conferences for blacks and whites above<br>
the local church level.<br>
<p>
4)  The lack of support for Christian education <br>
<p>
5)  The lack of programming geared to the 25-40 age group.<br>
<p>
  6)  A difficulty in distinguishing what is moral from what is cultural.<br>
<p>
7)  A crisis in spiritual authority.<br>
<p>
8)  A power gap between those who feel they 'own' the church and the <br>
younger generations<br>
<p>
Some of the visions we came up with to change this<br>
<p>
1)  Improve quality of church's educational system<br>
<p>
2)  Develop a union-wide support group for young adults, with a recognized<br>
leader in each church, who should serve on church board.<br>
<p>
3)  Build our own establishment structure by volunteering in areas<br>
otherwise neglected or inventing new offices in which to work.  <br>
<p>
4)  Build trust between the generations by giving of ourselves.<br>
<p>

It seemed a bit odd, even disinhibited, for Steven Timm to suggest<br>
that singles-type notices appear in the list.  Obviously when people<br>
are in e-mail communication similarities of interest will take their<br>
own course and singles will get acquainted.  However, the suggestion<br>
that as a third or fourth priority this list could directly serve that<br>
prupose appears to be an error in judgement.  Think about it.<br>

It seems that Jeff Tosk may really have raised a concern.  SDA-L<br>
members are voting with their subscriptions, and there has been a major<br>
number of signoffs from SDA-L in the last week.  Biographies have always<br>
been part of SDA-L's meager traffic.  I thought that adding the type of<br>
people one wants to meet would be a natural extension.  Perhaps I was wrong.<br>
<p>
Also, perhaps I am overreacting.  Whenever SDA-L generates a spurt of<br>
traffic we have signoffs.  I realize there are some people out there who<br>
would like to see SDA-L remain a low traffic list and just can't handle<br>
the 100 posts a month of SDAnet.  I also realize there are some people on<br>
SDA-L who would just as soon I drop dead.  Please, if the volume of traffic<br>
or the nature of the topics is really a problem, let us know by mail<br>
rather than with a desubscription.<br>

Since I was wishing people wouldn't be so shy, guess I'll put a bio in too.<br>
<p>
I'm Lisa Parry (white single female if those are important), closing in on 21<br>
(just a few more days).  I'm graduating from Andrews University next June with<br>
BA's in Math and Computer Science, planning to teach on the secondary level<br>
(in a church run school if possible, though currently I'm part time for the<br>
local public school system).<br>
<p>
I've lived quite a few places in the US, ranging from Maine to Texas to<br>
Utah including a few others.<br>
<p>
Grew up in an Adventist home, but really discovered Jesus for myself during<br>
my years at Adelphian Academy (had two years there before it closed),<br>
where a witnessing program was formed to give Bible Studies and neighborhood<br>
outreach to the surrounding community.<br>
<p>
All I can think of at the moment.  Keep the bios coming through - fun to read.<br>
<p>
God bless.<br>

<i>&gt; I am sometimes shy, but the main reason I haven't written any personal</i><br>
<i>&gt; interest stuff for the net is because I am married.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, I may have misread the initial posts regarding this, but I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; gotten the impression that this was some kind of SDA dating service...</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Please correct me if I have misunderstood the situation!</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Tony</i><br>
<p>
Oh yeah, big time.  (Well, I don't know about SDA-L, but SDAnet<br>
isn't a dating service. :-)<br>
<p>
Let me provide a hand, brother Tony...<br>
<p>
I'm 35 years old, married, with two terrific daughters, ages 5 and<br>
1.  I work for Hewlett-Packard Company, (whom I don't speak for,)<br>
with a job title that says nothing about the actual work I do, so I<br>
won't bore you with it. :-)<br>
<p>
I've been Adventist for about 4.5 years, and was led to God by my<br>
wife, whom I met when I was 27, and married on my 28th birthday.  I<br>
always refer to her as "the angel that saved me from myself." (She<br>
hates it when I say that. :-)<br>
<p>
I work with the Pathfinder club at my church as the marching and<br>
drilling instructor, and on occasion have been known to preach as a<br>
guest speaker.<br>
<p>
For recreation I enjoy playing darts and soccer (though not at the<br>
same time, :-) and playing with my daughters, the older of which<br>
plays soccer, and also takes gymnastics classes.  My younger<br>
daughter thus far prefers "peek-a-boo" and helping me with the<br>
groceries. (I put them away, she takes them back out. :-)<br>
<p>
Becoming Adventist was something I did because I thought the<br>
Scripture was preached there, not because I thought Ellen G. White<br>
was a prophet.  Based on the fact that she spoke according to the<br>
Word, I accept her as one, but not that every word she ever wrote<br>
must have been divinely inspired.  Even she never claimed that, nor<br>
did she ever claim that the Spirit of Prophecy was even on an equal<br>
footing with Scripture, let alone above it.  "A lesser light to<br>
lead people to the Greater Light," I believe she called it.<br>
<p>
I was raised Catholic, and left shortly after my confirmation at 13.<br>
I did not accept the concept of Catholic tradition being able to<br>
supercede Scripture.  As such, I do not accept the teachings of any<br>
church that will say "When Scripture and our writings of &lt;fill in<br>
the blank&gt; don't agree, our &lt;fill in the blank&gt; is correct, as it is<br>
a more recently revealed truth."   As it says in Isaiah (I believe<br>
it is 8:6, Paraphrased, as I don't have my Bible with me,) "If they<br>
speak not according to *this Word*, it is because there is no light<br>
in them." (Emphasis mine, of course)<br>
<p>
To me, The Seventh-day Adventist Church speaks according to the Word.<br>
I think there are portions of the teachings that go a bit further<br>
than what Scripture indicates, but nothing that I can find clearly<br>
contradicts Scripture, or condones conduct that Scripture clearly<br>
advises against, and those areas where I feel the church 'goes<br>
beyond' Scripture are not, in my opinion, of any consequence to<br>
salvation.  (I cite, for example, my previous postings about jewelry<br>
in general, and wedding rings in particular.  As jewelry has never<br>
been something I wore anyway (except for my wedding ring,) I don't<br>
consider it an issue.<br>
<p>
Thanks to the Lords help, I've been able to grow spiritually, and<br>
feel far closer to Him than I did before I came into His church.<br>
With help from the Holy Spirit, I hope to continue in the quest for<br>
spiritual perfection.<br>
<p>
Wow... way too long winded.  God bless you all...<br>

Just a note to respond to your request that we make ourselves known.<br>
<p>
Enjoyed reading Ian Brown's bio. I graduated from Univ of Iowa in 1975. Wow!<br>
that seems like a long time ago! I teach math at La Sierra University.<br>
I spent a mojority of my life to date on the African continent.<br>
<p>
Keep up the good work!<br>

[Steve Timm writes]<br>
<i>&gt;Some of the troubles that our group of young adults agreed were the major </i><br>
<i>&gt;problems in the church to us:</i><br>
<p>
	Without quoting them all, I found the things you wrote very<br>
interesting.  Many of those things I've thought of myself and haven't<br>
gotten the chance to get anyone else's opinion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2)  The education gap between college-educated and not, and the difficulty</i><br>
<i>&gt;of constructing a church to appeal to both.</i><br>
<p>
	I've found this to be true.  I live in a town with a large college,<br>
and there are some Ph. D's that have come across as intimidating and proud<br>
to some.  It may be true, but I think it's more of a matter of manner than<br>
attitude.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3)  The problem of separate conferences for blacks and whites above</i><br>
<i>&gt;the local church level.</i><br>
<p>
	Yep.  It's frustrating to try to coordinate anything with another<br>
(black) church in town.  I have probably not met some of their members yet<br>
after being here for two years.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;7)  A crisis in spiritual authority.</i><br>
<p>
	Something I've been thinking about for a while.  I wonder how much<br>
of this lies on the GC president?  I know the GC conferences are<br>
responsible for making any doctrinal decisions, but it seems rescently<br>
that they shy away from making touchy decisions (maybe rightly so.)  Example:<br>
women elders...  I think this also falls into the cultural vs. moral<br>
uncertainty.  I wonder what can be done about this.  Some say the church is<br>
too structured already.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;8)  A power gap between those who feel they 'own' the church and the </i><br>
<i>&gt;younger generations</i><br>
<p>
	Nothing new.  More generally I think /everyone/ has a problem with<br>
letting it be God's church instead of their own.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Some of the visions we came up with to change this</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;1)  Improve quality of church's educational system</i><br>
<p>
	And policies.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2)  Develop a union-wide support group for young adults, with a recognized</i><br>
<i>&gt;leader in each church, who should serve on church board.</i><br>
<p>
	I know there's a need there, but I really question if that's the<br>
best way to go about fixing the problem.  (Not that I disagree, just<br>
question.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;4)  Build trust between the generations by giving of ourselves.</i><br>
<p>
	Much of what you have written here seems (to me) to be problems<br>
on the local church and individual level.  I think the church leadership<br>
on the conference and union level should take a more agressive role in<br>
the education and providing of survices on the local level.  Many of the<br>
services are simply unknown to many people to even ask!<br>
	For example:  Conference senses the tension between the generations.<br>
Conferences should approach churches (not just pasters, *sigh*) with this<br>
problem and a propose some kind of solution, like a sermon, literature,<br>
or retreat on how one can build trust by giving of ourselves.<br>
	I see people in churches and local churches waiting for it's<br>
leadership to take a leadership roll, while those in positions are waiting<br>
for grass roots to take leadership.  While there really may not be anything<br>
wrong with the way things are organized, I think that there are<br>
misperceptions, and if nothing else, the leadership should take an agressive<br>
roll in dispelling these misperceptions.  (Enough opinions for one day.)<br>

<i> &gt;From st0o+@andrew.cmu.edu Tue Sep 15 10:59:43 1992</i><br>
<i>&gt;From: Jeff Tosk &lt;UMBJTO@LLUVM.BITNET&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It seemed a bit odd, even disinhibited, for Steven Timm to suggest</i><br>
<i>&gt;that singles-type notices appear in the list.  Obviously when people</i><br>
<i>&gt;are in e-mail communication similarities of interest will take their</i><br>
<i>&gt;own course and singles will get acquainted.  However, the suggestion</i><br>
<i>&gt;that as a third or fourth priority this list could directly serve that</i><br>
<i>&gt;prupose appears to be an error in judgement.  Think about it.</i><br>
<p>
To the initial point, I don't recall whether Steve suggested that this<br>
let's-get-to-know-each-other period was specifically meant for<br>
singles only. I didn't save that first post, but I think you should<br>
quote first before flaming. Nonetheless, I feel that Steve means well<br>
and maybe, not on an obvious level, we can get to know each other<br>
personally through this forum, singles and married folk.<br>
<p>
This issue is also related to an issue encountered in the usenet group<br>
soc.culture.filipino, as well as other cultural newsgroups.<br>
<p>
 From time to time someone will post a singles ad or some kind of program<br>
to get to know eligible Filipinos or Filipinas back home. The idea of<br>
posting that type of garbage on a cultural newsgroup smacks<br>
of colonialism, that the "strong, white male" gets his pick of those<br>
"obedient, young geisha-girl-types."<br>
<p>
OK, off my pulpit. Sorry. Let me crawl back to my lab bench.<br>

Hello, world! This is Stanleyned Guiloreza Macasieb here. Stan, for short.<br>
<p>
I occasionally pop in and out of SDAnet conversation since I logged<br>
in back in May 1992.<br>
<p>
I'm closing in on my 25th birthday in December. I was born and raised<br>
in Chicago to Filipino immigrants. I graduated from Lane Tech HS in<br>
Chicago in 1986 and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in<br>
1989 with a bachelor's in electrical engineering. Believe it or not,<br>
I actually do some useful work here at Motorola in northwest suburban<br>
Schaumburg as a hardware design engineer.<br>
<p>
I have two younger brothers, still live at home with my folks to<br>
save some moolah for a place of my own, am currently not seeing<br>
any girl in particular (nudge, nudge, wink, wink!). Hobbies include<br>
my computer, basketball, volleyball, and rollerblading. I also am<br>
an audio/visual freak, so I own a sizeable collection of CDs and cassettes,<br>
and I also own a Radio Shack DX-440 shortwave whenever I feel like<br>
listening in on the world.<br>
<p>
I first became involved in the church as a 6th grader in the Pathfinders<br>
program. I was baptized in May 1982 and had stayed involved with<br>
the church at a low level until January 1991 when I became a Sabbath<br>
School leader and a member of the Twentysomething fellowship group<br>
in the Chicago area. I have now added the title of Communications<br>
Secretary at the local church to my resume since July 1992.<br>
<p>
Whew! That covers it. So who's next???<br>

The issue of educated vs. noneducated members has always been a problem.  I<br>
have to agree that to some congreations, PhDs are arrogant and think they know<br>
everything.  But this is less common than the problems with MDs.  In some<br>
SDA congretions, an MD was considered the authority on everything (including<br>
theology).  They were typically selected as SS teachers, elders, school board<br>
members, and almost always church board.  Only until recently, when new MDs<br>
just into practice were too busy, did we see a decline in the number of medical<br>
professionals in church office.  Some of these MDs were dearly loved by there<br>
congregations.  Others have been considered downright snobs.  Recent statistics<br>
on the SDA church make-up indicate that it is an middle-class church.  The<br>
disparity between education/noneducated is less marked.  Yet, the inner city/pp9(poor and less educated) feel disenfranchised.<br>

<i>&gt; I have the book on order and should get it in a few days.  However, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; am a terribly slow reader, and _1994_ is a sizable book (&gt;500 pages).</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you want timely and varied feedback, I suggest several mature</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christians read it.  Don't worry about making Mr. Camping rich.  He</i><br>
<i>&gt; does not claim any special revalation from God.  He bases his</i><br>
<i>&gt; conclusion on a careful exegesis of the Bible.  He goes (I believe)</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather heavily into numerology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Resist the impulse to slam him.  I have no doubt that he is a true</i><br>
<i>&gt; believer.  His defense of the Bible as the word of God is powerful.</i><br>
<i>&gt; He did not want to write this book.  He did not want to draw such</i><br>
<i>&gt; attention to his ministry.  But believing as he did, he was compelled;</i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't you be?  The worst you could say is that he is deluded, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; you shouldn't say that until you have read the book, hence, my order.</i><br>
<i>&gt; On the other side of the coin, if he is right, he has an urgent</i><br>
<i>&gt; message to proclaim, one to be sure that is already written:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2 Corinthians chapter 6</i><br>
<i>&gt;   1 We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that</i><br>
<i>&gt; ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   2 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)</i><br>
<p>
I have a friend who bought into some analysis done by a dentist at<br>
LLU.  He tried to show that a certain year (1992 I think) was the<br>
"jubilee of jubilees" and therefore the year when the world would end.<br>
<p>
Unless you are mathematically sophisticated this kind of stuff can be<br>
very convincing while also being false.  Martin Gardner, the famous<br>
mathematical games writer, once showed how the Pope could be linked<br>
with 666, and then went on to show how the name "Ellen G. White" could<br>
just as easily be linked.  His point was that you can play all sorts<br>
of games with numbers.<br>

Well, here goes. (This could be a mistake - I kind of like the anonymity<br>
of long distance e-mail!)<br>
<p>
Name:    Anthony John Dyson<br>
DOB:     27th January, 1968<br>
<p>
Only people who don't know me call me Anthony, because I'm always<br>
introduced as Tony. That way I can always tell who has read my name<br>
somewhere and who my real friends are. :)<br>
<p>
I've been a white male SDA all my life, and in January 1990 I became a<br>
married white male SDA. My father is a minister, and in the South Pacific<br>
Division that means I don't have a home town. I was born in Tasmania, and<br>
lived in New Zealand and PNG as well as the Aussie mainland during my<br>
school years.<br>
<p>
I attended the SDA tertiary institution in Australia, Avondale College, where<br>
I obtained a B.Ed.(Physics). Following that, I taught there for a year (!),<br>
picking up some work left by people on study leave. Currently I am studying<br>
at the University of Newcastle, doing the fourth year of B.Sc.(Hons), still<br>
majoring in physics. My future plans are totally indeterminate until I find<br>
out my results at the end of the year!<br>
<p>
One of the best things I ever did was to take two years off study in between<br>
high school and college. Part of that time I spent as a salesman in a large<br>
discount store, and the rest as an assistant nurse in the psychiatric ward<br>
of a North Queensland hospital. During that time I realized how much there is<br>
to life that I know nothing about!<br>
<p>
As far as interests go, I enjoy music (listening, performing and producing),<br>
basketball, computing and lots of other things. Unfortunately my hobbies have<br>
taken somewhat of a back seat this year, because I'm chasing a scholarship<br>
so that I can continue with my study program. I'll probably find out in a<br>
couple of months that they didn't take enough of a back seat, but not to<br>
worry...<br>
<p>
So there's a few paragraphs which only go to show how many words you can<br>
write without really saying anything significant about yourself! I would<br>
introduce my wife, but she's just signed onto the net herself, and I'll<br>
let her make her own introductions.<br>
<p>

Greetings SDAnetters!<br>
<p>
I just joined the net a few weeks ago.  I'm 38 and single, but have<br>
been dating a very nice lady for the last 2.5 years.  I've worked for<br>
Tektronix in Beaverton Oregon USA since 1973.  I graduated from Laurelwood<br>
Academy also in 1973.  My job title is Telecomunications Analyst but<br>
what I really do is teach people how to use Email.  Some of my interests<br>
include computers, basketball, and bicycling.  It's been interesting<br>
seeing all of your opinions so far, and I look forward to throwing<br>
in my $ .02 worth occasinally in the future.<br>
<p>
I'd also like to take a moment to thank Steve for moderating this Net<br>
concidering the amount of time needed to read all these messages and<br>
route them on to the list.<br>

I'm glad to see more traffic on the list.  I didn't mean to flame<br>
anyone with my concerns regarding "personals".  In any case I'll<br>
introduce myself.<br>
<p>
I am a research neurobiologist at the Jerry L Pettis Veterans' Affairs<br>
Medical Center in Loma Linda.  I am also Assistant Research Professor<br>
of Psychiatry and Physiology at LLU School of Medicine.  My research<br>
in in the area of Parkinson's disease.  I am particularly interested<br>
in the brain pigment neuromelanin and its role in neurodegenerative<br>
disease.  My approach is biophysical as I use several forms of<br>
spectroscopy and electrochemistry to understand the midbrain<br>
dopamine system.<br>
<p>
I have been interested in Christianity most of my life (I'm forty).<br>
I was raised in a Jewish family and as a young student sang in the<br>
choir.  That is how I heard about Jesus.  We usually sang early<br>
church music for its artistic value and I listened to the words<br>
more carefully than most.  I was raised in NY City and had little<br>
opportunity to attend many churches other than Mass at St. Patricks<br>
and the like.  I loved the music of Bach and became aware of the<br>
Gospels.  I could never square the fact that Jesus is the Prince<br>
of Peace and during the Vietnam war the vicar of the armed forces,<br>
a prominant NY churchman, preached some really hate-filled sermons<br>
suggesting that killing in Vietnam was OK, even important.  I could<br>
never imagine Jesus with an M-16.  I came to believe that Christianity<br>
was dead and that most Christians used the name of God to maintain<br>
a conservative social order.  Most of the Protestant preaching I heard<br>
was on the radio on Sundays and dealt with condemnation of people for<br>
lack of patriotism or liberal moral views.  I never heard much about<br>
the love of God being healing or descriptions of the Cristian life as<br>
one of service to others, a view I learned from the Bible.  I met SDA's<br>
about 8 years ago and was supprised to meet people who actually<br>
believed that God is a real living being who cares about us.  In retrospect<br>
the folks I met then were rare indeed.  I was baptized and accepted God's<br>
love and healing in my life.  I will not preach here but I want to pose<br>
a question:  Do you think that it is appropriate to advocate an experimental<br>
relationship with God?  This has worked for me.  Could this be what is meant<br>
by "Taste and see that the Lord is good"?<br>

&lt;----<br>
<p>
I for one think it's appropriate, and I would be very interested to hear what<br>
you have to say on this, Jeff. All my life people have said to me sentences<br>
involving the phrase "relationship with God", and very few of them actually<br>
elaborated on it. I remember during my late teens thinking that the phrase<br>
was probably passed down from generation to generation and nobody really knew<br>
what it meant!<br>
<p>
Also, I read with interest your comments regarding the chaplain of the armed<br>
forces. Isn't it strange how that the vast majority of professed Christians<br>
who are in the public eye project a most unfortunate view of Christianity. We<br>
have guys like that, using "the will of God" to justify their own personal<br>
actions and decisions whatever they may be. We have the tele-evangelists, <br>
using God to make money and to become stars. In Australia we have the <br>
Reverend Fred Nile, who if he was in the U.S. would be a leading light for<br>
the moral majority I suspect. His idea of Christianity is anti-abortion,<br>
anti-gay, anti-alcohol and drugs, anti- anti- anti-, and people get the idea<br>
that Christians are just a bunch of do-right losers.<br>
<p>
This really leaves us with a big responsibility: to be a true representative<br>
of God ourselves. If we let the average non-Christian form their impression<br>
of Christ purely on the basis of these guys, whom I would label "false<br>
witnesses", then we have let our Lord and friend down in a big way. This<br>
challenges me every day - now I just need to rise to the challenge a bit<br>
more frequently!<br>

I've managed to locate a list of references which I was given when we discussed<br>
the origins issue during my College course. The list is prefaced by a brief<br>
introductory paper which I found helpful in understanding the structure of<br>
the debate.<br>
<p>
All who are interested in this information, let me know *directly* by e-mail<br>
(don't make Steve redirect it all, that's unnecessary), and I'll post it to<br>
you. I won't be posting it to the SDAnet, since (a) it is 384 lines long, and<br>
(b) the topic is banned!<br>
<p>
Obviously I think this material is very worthwhile, otherwise I wouldn't have<br>
spent the last hour typing it all in for you guys... ;-)<br>

I originally got the idea for the project which appears below about a month<br>
ago when my baby actually did leave me.  Those of you who have been following<br>
SDAnet closely for a while know that I have never dated anyone as virtuous<br>
as the hypothetical 'baby' described below, so both characters in the<br>
following piece are totally fictitious.  The place, however, is quite<br>
real.<br>
This is the first draft of something which may eventually be revised <br>
into a song, some of the words don't quite fit the rhythm yet.<br>
<p>
These preliminaries aside, I give you<br>
<p>
Got those baby left me in Berrien Springs blues....<br>
<p>
Well it was after vespers, and I was feeling doubt<br>
So I walked down by the cinema where the angels all hang out.<br>
Said "have you seen my baby?  She really was a gem<br>
Made that Special K loaf up there with the best of them."<br>
<p>
Boy, he said, we see lost babies all the time,<br>
But your baby won't come down here, she is just too fine.<br>
It's nine-thirty and they're going to close the gate.<br>
Why not see if she went to Johnson Gym to roller-skate?<br>
<p>
I was just there, Gabe old boy, that's why I'm feeling low<br>
We skated to Texas' Yellow Rose so sweet and slow<br>
But when Heritage Singers played she got in a huff<br>
She walked right off and left me 'cause the music was too rough.<br>
<p>
They just feed us Numete sandwiches, so we could use a cook<br>
Maybe we can't find your baby, but we're sure gonna look<br>
Sometimes during church we hang out outside Pioneer,<br>
so tell us just how we'd spot your baby dear.<br>
<p>
She wore her hemlines always just an inch below the knee<br>
so at the beach on Sabbath we'd not go too far to sea.<br>
She wore a jeweled stick-pin in her cowl-neck sweater,<br>
and golden watches from the last three guys who met 'er.<br>
<p>
We promised to be pastor and nurse in foreign lands,<br>
The moonlight shimmered from the clear nail polish on her hands,<br>
Little Debbie, I told her, we've made the right connection,<br>
and we held hands until the dean stopped our display of affection.<br>
<p>
I gave a Birthday-Thank offering, when I first learned her name<br>
But now the banquet, even Ingath'ring won't be the same.<br>
I'm not Historically Correct, and so she says for spite,<br>
She's going to date a direct descendant of Ellen G. White.<br>
<p>
Wow, that's heavy, man, for you to watch her go away,<br>
but listen for her where you hear piano playing "Trust And Obey."<br>
If you find her soon, have her bring us a video,<br>
and a double order of Special K, and Kaffree tea, to go.<br>

Dear Tony,<br>
I could not tell exactly where your response originated so I can't<br>
reply personally.  However there is nothing I want to say that I wouldn't<br>
want the others to see.<br>
I very much appreciated your comments.  I too believe that the ideal for<br>
Christians is to represent God.  Although I fail daily, I would like my<br>
side of every interaction with others to reflect God's chatacter.<br>
<p>
I am going to think through a careful discussion of what I mean by<br>
an experimental relationship with God.  I would not want to be misunderstood.<br>
I'll be away for a few days.  I will write at greater length when I<br>
return ....Jeff Tosk<br>

Two biographies in one here.<br>
   I'm Lola Aagaard (Boram) -- keeping my maiden name professionally<br>
has resulted in a certain amount of schizoid behavior.  I married<br>
Robert Boram in 1981 and I'll give you his bio too.<br>
<p>
I am fifth generation SDA on one side of my family and fourth on the<br>
other.  My mom was raised in the mission field (Malaysia) and two of<br>
my siblings have been missionaries.  My eldest brother teaches at<br>
Pacific Union College and my sister teaches at Mountain View Academy<br>
in California.  I tell you that to show how steeped in Adventism our<br>
family is ... and yet Robert and I turned down the opportunity to work<br>
at Andrews.  What is this generation coming to?<br>
<p>
Anyway, I am a double graduate of PUC (nursing and Biology) and also<br>
a double graduate of the University of Oklahoma (MPH and then PHD).<br>
I'm in my eighth month of pregnancy with our first child, so am not<br>
working full-time at this point.  When I do teach, it is generally to\<br>
graduate students in education:  research methods, statistics, computer<br>
data analysis, measurement, even adult education theory.  Beginning<br>
October 1, I will be a half-time research associate with Appalachia<br>
Educational Laboratory, which means I get to work at home most of the<br>
time and travel about 3 days a month to collect data.<br>
<p>
HHobbies?  Who really has time for hobbies?  We just bought an old<br>
house on about 2 acres and I'm discovering the "joys" of being a<br>
home-owner.  Previously I used to do a lot of singing in community<br>
choirs and a bit of paid solo work for various churches, but that<br>
is slacking off as I get busier (not to mention more out of breath as<br>
my belly increases in size!).  My main hobby now is trying to figure out<br>
a cheap but non-violent way to keep the groundhogs out of my garden!<br>
<p>
Now for Robert.  He also is third and fourth generation SDA, grew up in<br>
the mission field (Nigeria and Sierra Leone).  He is a graduate of La<br>
Sierra (Biophysics) and a double grad of Univ. of OK (MS in Physics,<br>
PHD in Science Education).  He is an assistant professor in Science<br>
Education at Morehead State University, Morehead, KY.  He's really<br>
excited about the coming child, but less excited about all the home<br>
repairs he's having to do!  Hobbies: weather-watching, stained glass<br>
making.<br>
<p>
We're both active in the little church here (membership=44, attending=20<br>
on a good day).  Robert has Juniors, I am one of the adult S.S. teachers<br>
and superintendents.  I also play the piano once a month, and am<br>
supposed to be putting out a bulletin, but can't locate the covers!<br>
<p>
Hope this goes through -- it's the second time I've tried.<br>
<p>

Here is an announcement of a coming Noah's Ark convetion..<br>
<p>
ARK-athon II  and ARK EXPO<br>
<p>
January 29,30 and 31, 1993<br>
Monarch Motor Hotel<br>
Portland, Oregon<br>
<p>
Noah's Ark<br>
<p>
Did it exist?   Does it still exist?<br>
<p>
Tantalizing stories that the Ark hides in the ice cap of Mt. Ararat have<br>
triggered intense research tracing down sources and adveturious expeditions<br>
on the mountains dangerious slopes.  People from all across the world are<br>
involved.  Ark-athon II is but only the second time that many of these people<br>
will have met together to share their research and expierences.<br>
<p>
The story of Noah's Ark and the Flood has been one of the most ridiculed part<br>
of Genesis.  Proof positive that Genesis (and so the Bible) is just a<br>
collection of myths.  All Biblical doctrine have their roots in Genesis, and<br>
if Genesis has no credulity; then Christianity has no basis.  But if Noah's<br>
Ark is located and it's identity substantiated by scientific studies, mady<br>
people may find that they need to rethink their position about the claims<br>
of the Bible.<br>
<p>
Everyone with an interest in Noah's Ark is invited to come rub shoulders<br>
with veteran searchers such as:<br>
Ahmet Arslan:  Ararat native, he knows Ararat better than anyone, Voice of<br>
     America broadcaster, and has extensive Ararat portfolio.<br>
Dr. John Morris:  Ararat expeditions leader, author of several books about<br>
     Noah's Ark and Professor at ICR Graduate School.<br>
Dr. Don Shockey:  Expedition leader and has spent more helicopter hours<br>
     around Ararat than any other searcher.<br>
Rev. Walter Lange:  Creationist lecturer, editor of Ark Today published by<br>
     the Genesis Institute he organized, and developer of the Bible Science<br>
     association.<br>
Dr. John Baumgartner:  Scientist at the Los Alamose National Laboratory in<br>
     New Mexico,  Has doen extensive research on the Durupinar anomaly.<br>
Bill Crouse:  Editor of Ararat Report, chairman of Christain Information<br>
     Ministries, International, and climbed Ararat several times.<br>
Dr. Charles Willis:  Expedition leader for many years, now has evidence that<br>
     Noah's Ark may be on another mountain.<br>
Rev. Eddie Atkinson:  Will display scale models of Noah's Ark.  The models<br>
     contain figures of people, animals and supplies.<br>
<p>
Watch them on the comming CBS Special "The Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark".<br>
Then, come listen to them personally and ask your questions.<br>
<p>
Be sure to bring your video camera!<br>

Steve,<br>
I know I am not on SDAnet anymore after having lost my access to Internet,<br>
but I wanted to explain what the LDS church means by a dispensation, since a<br>
poster just before I left seems to think that we mean something which is<br>
incorrect.<br>
 <br>
The post gave the impression that my church thought that a dispensation<br>
was a time that the Lord changed the gospel meaning.<br>
 <br>
In popular parlance here in the US today, NOT.<br>
 <br>
To the LDS church a dispensation is a period of time during which the gospel<br>
message is restored to what it had originally was. Dispensations are needed<br>
because men slowly reject the truth of the gospel and change it to fit their<br>
needs, rather than changing their lives to what God has said. This falling<br>
away is called an apostacy. Such an apostacy occured shortly after the death<br>
of the Lord's apostles and extended until the 1800's. On this we agree, I<br>
think. On who and how the apostacy was ended, at least for some, we<br>
disagree.<br>
 <br>
  I don't know how to set the Reply-To: in a note coming from Compuserve,<br>
but feel free to send directly to me, or cc me, on any comments to this<br>
topic.<br>

My name is Minna Kristiina Puustelli.  I'm a 21-year-old female student and I<br>
study linguistics (English and German) at the University of Jyv{skyl{ in<br>
Finland.  In about 3 years I should finish my studies and start teaching<br>
English as a foreign language. In addition to English and German I've tried<br>
to learn some Swedish (the other official language of Finland), French and<br>
Russian - and there are so many other languages that I would be interested in!<br>
Hobbies... I don't have many of them. I play the piano, I go swimming once in<br>
a while... that's about it at the moment.<br>
<p>
I'm an SDA.  I was baptized only a year ago and I'm really glad that I made<br>
the decision to follow Jesus.  Even though it means struggling every day, it's<br>
worth it. I'm sure you all would agree. My mother is adventist, but my father<br>
and my brother (19) are not. We have adventist schools in Finland but I<br>
haven't atteded them. I've been to Newbold College in England for one<br>
year and also to Bogenhofen in Austria for a summer course so I know<br>
what adventist<br>
schools are like.<br>
<p>
I enjoy reading the discussions on the net. I have to confess that my Bible-<br>
knowledge is not very wide and, therefore, I can't comment on many of the<br>
topics, but on the other hand it makes it more interesting for me to read<br>
your 'debates' and seek the answers from the Bible myself. I find the bios<br>
fascinating - hopefully there are more of them coming!<br>
<p>

The history of our church here in Pittsburgh is, unfortunately, often<br>
marked by the time passed since a particular dispute.  During the time<br>
I was gone from Pittsburgh, the scandal caused by removing the wood rail<br>
from the organ loft has been replaced by a new and greater one.<br>
<p>
One of our church members teaches at Shippensburg State.  For the last <br>
several years she has brought the girls choir she directs there to give<br>
us a worship service of all sacred music, and they have always been well-<br>
received and given an appropriate program.  None of them is to my knowledge<br>
SDA.  This past spring they also brought along their gospel choir.<br>
<p>
Even SDA gospel choirs who know all the rules of being appropriate have <br>
caused a stir in our church previously, so it's not surprising that a few<br>
seconds after they kicked on their electric guitars and drums, a hue and <br>
cry resulted.  (All those who were there report that indeed the music was<br>
loud, vibrant, and upbeat.)  <br>
<p>
A retired minister who was at one time our senior pastor got up while the <br>
music was still continuing, marched up to the front of the church, and <br>
said to the musicians "You can't do this in God's house."  He continued<br>
to make noise and commotion until such time as the deacons restrained <br>
him and removed him from the sanctuary.  The concert continued to its end.<br>
<p>
All this happened in April, and in September it is still the talk of <br>
the church.  The retired pastor has become a hero to many others of the older<br>
section of the church who felt the same way. (Some of whom had no use<br>
for him when he was the pastor.)   We have heard of the injuries<br>
he supposedly suffered in this incident.  <br>
<p>
In conversations with the younger generation, I have heard suggestions<br>
such as banning him from teaching his Sabbath School class, censuring<br>
him or <br>
disfellowshipping him, even, forming a new congregation where we don't<br>
have to put up with this foolishness, and many other things.<br>
<p>
Personally, I feel we are challenged to the core by this incident.  If our<br>
church is a loving, caring, affirming church (as we declare ourselves in <br>
our local mission statement to be)  then it is our duty to affirm this man<br>
as our brother in the Lord and find some way to open a channel of <br>
communication with him.<br>
<p>
So I ask, how can you communicate with someone when the only way he knows <br>
how to communicate is through appropriated authority?  He has worked his<br>
whole life in the church, and the accepted method of discourse through <br>
most of that time was to dig up a stack of quotes, and say "Ellen White<br>
says this, Ellen White is inspired, therefore I am inspired, therefore<br>
I am right, therefore you have sinned against the Lord and will miss out<br>
on eternal life."  We can not fault him for being a child of his<br>
culture, nor<br>
can we stoop to that level of using the Spirit of Prophecy as a club. <br>
(There is in fact a Spirit of Prophecy quote against using the<br>
Testimonies as a club, but for obvious reasons it can't be used against<br>
anybody.) <br>
<p>
We will not build consensus and be of one accord by running roughshod<br>
over any segment of the population of our church.  Yet the<br>
misrepresentation of <br>
God to 40 young people from Shippensburg plus other visitors that were<br>
there is severe and we need to make sure it doesn't happen again.  Any<br>
suggestions<br>
are helpful.  I would appreciate if people would focus on the issue of<br>
communication and not on whether the outrage over wild music was<br>
justified or not.<br>

To SDAnet,<br>
<p>
Does anyone know (if any) of a book/article which details the origin<br>
of Sunday-as-the-Lord's-day, told from an impartial and unaffliated<br>
scholar?  Preferably a non-Christian one, who is respected by both<br>
Catholic and Protestant Christians.  I ask because I know Adventists<br>
and Roman Catholics have their bais (papal authority), while<br>
Sunday-Protestants have their own (anything but papal authority).<br>
Or do I have to settle with several authors and make the ends meet?<br>
Thanks!<br>
<p>
Danny<br>

Since our young adults discussion group last week voted that we should<br>
improve the quality of our educational system from top to bottom, <br>
I am doing my part.  Our local church school has an Apple //e computer,<br>
and I have just got it back up and working over the weekend.  If there <br>
is any public domain software that you know about, especially for <br>
math and science, please let me know.  <br>
<p>
This is part of a new program our church is doing this year, trying to<br>
involve our many local professionals in supporting and enhancing the <br>
church school program.  A little bit of help can go a long way.<br>
Unless I hear from a lot of other people saying to share these ideas,<br>
responses should just come as E-mail to me.<br>

There are over 10,000 public domain programs for the Apple II computers.<br>
The best place to look for these is in the back of one of the computer<br>
magazines published specifically for Apple IIs such as A+ or InCider.  There<br>
are ads at the back.  You'll find several vendors that will send you a catalog<br>
of PD software they have available.<br>
<p>
Another place you might look is through CompuService special interest groups.<br>
I used to have an Apple IIe until I bought a Mac 4 years ago.  Nice little<br>
machines but not powerful enough for me.<br>

In the last "translation faith", someone examined the question of whether <br>
or not Jesus died for Enoch.  It was agreed that this answer was "yes."<br>
Enoch stood no more or no less than anyone else in need of the grace of God.<br>
<p>
Yet Enoch remains, along with Elijah, one of the few to be translated to <br>
heaven without seeing death.  Let me state what I think everyone agrees on,<br>
then try to phrase the question more carefully.<br>
<p>
Agreed:  There will be some in heaven for whom the work of<br>
sanctification was not complete at the time of their death<br>
<p>
Agreed:  There will be some alive at the second coming who keep the<br>
commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, examples of the fact that God<br>
can and does save from sin.<br>
<p>
The question:  Will all those translated (taken to heaven without seeing<br>
death) be totally and completely sanctified before that time?  Is there<br>
any<br>
difference between the requirements for being translated without seeing death<br>
and the requirements for being saved if one dies before the Second Coming?<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By the way, while Sabbath is comparatively restful for most folk, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; incredibly busy for pastors.  Is their work wrong on the Sabbath?</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Hint:  There's a verse in Scripture addressing this specifically.  Extra</i><br>
<i>&gt; bonus points to the finder.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
The direct answer to your question is, "No."  And I'll take a stab at<br>
your bonus question.  How about Matthew 12:5 (vv. 1-5 for context)?<br>

  the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are<br>
  blameless?<br>

So you're after an unbiased account of how the Lord's day has popularly become<br>
recognized as Sunday.<br>
<p>
The best I can come up with off the top of my head is a certain Jewish rabbi<br>
who has written some good stuff about the Sabbath. I suppose you could hardly<br>
call a Jew unbiased, but at least they don't get too excited either way about<br>
the pope. I'm going up to the College library today to borrow a book about<br>
molecular orbital theory :-) so I'll check the reference while I'm there.<br>
<p>
You probably won't have any success finding any work where the author hasn't<br>
got their own personal beliefs to back up. Particularly with a topic like this,<br>
the only people who are even interested in it are those with something at<br>
stake.<br>

[Steven Timm writes:]<br>
<i>&gt; One of our church members teaches at Shippensburg State.  For the last </i><br>
<i>&gt; several years she has brought the girls choir she directs there to give</i><br>
<i>&gt; us a worship service of all sacred music, and they have always been well-</i><br>
<i>&gt; received and given an appropriate program.  None of them is to my knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; SDA.  This past spring they also brought along their gospel choir.</i><br>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<p>
My beliefs on CCM (contemporary christian music) aside for the purposes<br>
of this discussion, I have a couple of comments and an anecdote that<br>
might be helpful.<br>
<p>
During the first year that I was at a certain church that I attended a<br>
number of years ago the men's choral group from Azusa Pacific University<br>
sang at our church service.  The program included an eclectic mix of<br>
traditional, ancient (monophonic), gospel, jazz, and contemporary (some<br>
of which was "light rock") Christian music.  They were accompanied by<br>
electric guitars, drums, and a saxaphone (on the jazz number).  While a<br>
few people did get up and leave, they seemed to be trying to do so<br>
discreetly; those who remained gave heartier "Amens" to the songs whose<br>
styles they preferred.<br>
<p>
During discussions over potluck following, I was interested to observe that<br>
many baby boomer types were not at all comfortable with certain of the pieces;<br>
hence, it was not just the "Geritol set" who had concerns.<br>
<p>
In response to those who were considering "setting them straight!",<br>
a number of us pointed out the following:<br>
1) The gentlemen truly believed they were offering worship to God; hence,<br>
   we should not speak in any way to offend them (I Cor 10:32).<br>
2) They had put their heart and soul into practising and performing the<br>
   music.  One could certainly appreciate that, in light of Eccl 9:10.<br>
3) The "surprise" or "shock" factor should have been removed; folk should<br>
   have known in advance what kind of program was coming up so that they<br>
   could absent themselves if they so chose.<br>
4) The group had been invited by the pastor with the cognizance of the<br>
   church board (not that they knew what was in store, tho), i.e., channels<br>
   of authority had been respected.  (This is where many who are wanting<br>
   to bring in CCM get themselves into trouble; they fail to follow proper<br>
   channels; indeed they are often confrontational or else subversive.)<br>
5) The gentleman were indeed Christian gentleman in their behavior.  One<br>
   girl (a member, altho a rare attendee) came to church wearing a quite<br>
   short red dress, down off the shoulders, and flirted endlessly with<br>
   the fellows.  Their response showed that they understood Job 31:1.<br>
   You *have* to respect them for that.<br>
6) It might have been better to schedule the program for other than church<br>
   service hours (like, in the afternoon).<br>
7) It might have been wiser to steer them towards the local celebration church<br>
   than our more conservative (even tho largely baby boomer) congregation.<br>
8) In the future (the pastor had already asked them to come back next year),<br>
   we would request that the drumset and bass guitar be skipped and that<br>
   they could pull from their repertoire pieces that would be more appreciated<br>
   once they were familiarized with their audience (which they, in fact,<br>
   did the following year).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Personally, I feel we are challenged to the core by this incident.  If our</i><br>
<i>&gt; church is a loving, caring, affirming church (as we declare ourselves in </i><br>
<i>&gt; our local mission statement to be) then it is our duty to affirm this man</i><br>
<i>&gt; as our brother in the Lord and find some way to open a channel of </i><br>
<i>&gt; communication with him.</i><br>
<p>
I appreciate and admire your attitude towards this gentleman.  Approaching<br>
him will take great wisdom (cf. Prov 18:19).<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We will not build consensus and be of one accord by running roughshod</i><br>
<i>&gt; over any segment of the population of our church.  Yet the</i><br>
<i>&gt; misrepresentation of </i><br>
<i>&gt; God to 40 young people from Shippensburg plus other visitors that were</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is severe and we need to make sure it doesn't happen again.  Any</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggestions</i><br>
<i>&gt; are helpful.  I would appreciate if people would focus on the issue of</i><br>
<i>&gt; communication and not on whether the outrage over wild music was</i><br>
<i>&gt; justified or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Our church is a relatively small church near Mecca, (Berrien Springs),<br>
with about 150 members.  To a large extent it is a youthful church with<br>
a fair number of Seminary student families, and many in the 30's age<br>
group.<br>
<p>
During a remodeling and addition that occured a few years ago, three<br>
crosses where designed into a wooden mosaic in the Youth room that was<br>
added to the church and a wooden cross was put on a stone face wall in<br>
the front of the church behind the podium.  This was done after some<br>
discussion with the board and church at large.  There was one elderly<br>
elder in his late eighties or early nineties that object vehemiently.<br>
The church board and the board of elders had listened to his objectsions<br>
and overruled him.  All of the elders of the church were asked to not<br>
speak on the issue from the pulpit.  The issue was closed.<br>
<p>
Some time later, the elderly elder was scheduled to preach.  The special<br>
music this Sabbath was a group of elementary school children from one of<br>
the Berrien Springs SDA schools.  The elder started his sermon by<br>
decrying this symbol of evil and of the Catholic church and daring<br>
anyone in the church to come down to the front and tear it down from the<br>
wall.  All of this was in front of visiting school children and a few of<br>
their parents.  The visiting parents eventually got up and took the<br>
children home so that they wouldn't have to see what was going on.  A<br>
couple of our members, one of which is one of the elders, was raised as<br>
a Catholic and did not see anything particularly evil about the cross as<br>
a symbol to remind us of what Christ has done for us.<br>
<p>
The elderly elder was subsequently banned from the pulpit by not<br>
scheduling him to preach or partake on the platform at all.  He was very<br>
much hurt by this action.  Many of the church members tried to make a<br>
special point of stopping by his home and their affirmation of him as a<br>
person in inspite of their differences of opinion on some subjects.<br>
<p>
He became sick and many of the church brought food, encouragement, and<br>
assistance to them before he eventualy passed away.  Before he passed<br>
away he was convinced that the church did truely love and respect him<br>
even if they didn't all agree with him on everything.<br>
<p>
I don't know if this situation can give you any insights in dealing with<br>
your situation or not, but it did sound somewhat similar.  It is at<br>
least one churchs attempt in dealing with this kind of situation.<br>

These biographies are great, with many including comments about spiritual <br>
encounters - at least, when people became SDA or whatever. It is this aspect<br>
that interested me the most.<br>
<p>
For instance, so many people seem to have discovered Adventism fairly<br>
recently, unlike me - a mere 'ministers kid' grown up in the subculture.<br>
I'd like to ask those in that category and others who feel qualified to <br>
answer:<br>
"What is it about Adventism/Christianity that captured your interest?",<br>
"What do you think our best features are?"<br>
<p>
And:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From: Jeffrey Tosk</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I will not preach here but I want to pose</i><br>
<i>&gt;a question:  Do you think that it is appropriate to advocate an experimental</i><br>
<i>&gt;relationship with God?  This has worked for me.  Could this be what is meant</i><br>
<i>&gt;by "Taste and see that the Lord is good"?</i><br>
<p>
I'd really like to see more on this. I think I like the sound of it.<br>
<p>
When I read the book on Keith Green's life, I felt excited to be able to<br>
see inside someone like I never see inside those around me. To see how<br>
they felt about God, and how they developed in their understanding of God.<br>
<p>
I sometimes think that if I knew a bit more about others struggles, I might<br>
do better in my own.<br>
<p>
What about spiritual bios?<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The question:  Will all those translated (taken to heaven without seeing</i><br>
<i>&gt; death) be totally and completely sanctified before that time?  Is there</i><br>
<i>&gt; any</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference between the requirements for being translated without seeing death</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the requirements for being saved if one dies before the Second Coming?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
The answer is plainly yes. EGW spells it out very clearly.<br>
<p>
Is it any different living with a mediator in the heavenly sanctuary<br>
from living in a time with no mediator in the heavenly sanctuary to <br>
forgive sins ?<br>
<p>
Ruben.<br>

There seems to be two broad groups into which SDAs can mostly be divided.<br>
<p>
Some would class these groups the "conservative" and the "liberal", others<br>
would class them the "traditional" and the "open-minded", etc. Whatever <br>
labels one chooses to use, a lot of us can be fairly easily categorized<br>
this way. I will use the conservative/liberal labels for the purpose of<br>
this post.<br>
<p>
Ideally there is room for many different views of things within the umbrella<br>
of Adventism. However even this statement in itself is difficult for a<br>
conservative SDA to make. The idea of unity in the fundamental doctrines and<br>
diversity otherwise seems to be supported by all, but the dispute comes in<br>
deciding what is fundamental and what is more peripheral.<br>
<p>
What does this have to do with the problem? Well, if any of us was to <br>
perceive the actions of the church to be wrong in a significant area, it<br>
would be our responsibility to speak up. If we did not, then we could<br>
ourselves be held accountable for allowing the heresy to continue and<br>
to propagate.<br>
<p>
The conservative SDA is in the unfortunate position where many of the<br>
actions and attitudes of the church seem to be seriously at fault. This<br>
covers most new thought in theology, modern worship styles, lifestyle<br>
issues and much more.<br>
<p>
It's easy for a liberal SDA to see various things happening, not all of<br>
which he/she agrees with personally, and to accept all of them as just<br>
variations on a theme. So the liberal SDA doesn't realize what the<br>
conservative SDA is going through.<br>
<p>
To understand what I mean, think of something which you yourself would<br>
feel totally uncomfortable with were it to happen in church. For me, an<br>
example would be if as part of the worship service the pastor was to<br>
consult with an astrologer and advise us on our actions for the following<br>
week. If this kind of thing was to happen regularly - or even just a few<br>
times - in my church, I would feel it my duty to make it known that I<br>
felt that we were not doing the right thing by God.<br>
<p>
The conservative SDA sees drama performed, hears gospel music played, <br>
is preached to on theology that has not been part of our historical<br>
message, and is not preached to on theology that has. He/she sees church<br>
members wearing jewellery and make-up, going to the movies, participating<br>
in competitive sport and so on. They see these things as just as offensive<br>
to God as I do astrology in the worship service. Therefore it is their<br>
responsibility to make a stand for the right.<br>
<p>
It is going to be very difficult to reconcile this situation. From the<br>
liberal perspective, it is easy to say "tolerance", "unity in diversity",<br>
"individuality" and so on. From the conservative perspective, these things<br>
are not so easy, because the conservative SDA is being asked to be<br>
tolerant of something which he/she believes is fundamentally wrong.<br>
<p>
I'm not saying this to excuse poor communication styles or unloving<br>
approaches to things. But it's certainly something to think about.<br>

[The words of Russell Yonkers]<br>
I think that it is important that in any conflict over worship<br>
observances that we need to be very careful not to use any sort of<br>
inflamitory words.  As soon as we start calling a perspn a zelot or that<br>
it was "wild" music we start to arrouse the passions of the paople<br>
involved in the confrontation.  This only leads to heartace and<br>
bitterness.  We are dealing with things that people feel deep down in<br>
their very hearts about God and thier responsibility.  This needs to be<br>
handled with great care.<br>
<p>
One person put into a post that some people that favor contemporary<br>
christian music use subterfuge and try to work around the system instead<br>
of through the system.  Although I don't condone thier actions I can<br>
understand why they are doing what they are doing.  So many people feel<br>
that thier particular way of worship and thier "values" are right and<br>
the only ones that should be used.  They thus will not open-mindedly<br>
listen to others ideas.  This makes people resentful and distrusting of<br>
the system.  <br>
<p>
I am not saying that there is not right and wrong.  I am very adament <br>
about the decline in moral values in our society.  I have noticed<br>
however that to often we confuse important value issues for unimportant<br>
ones.   Could it be that the unimportant ones give us greater visibility<br>
without putting ourselves personally at risk of sevear ridicule or could<br>
it be that Satan is trying to confuse us to keep us away from the real<br>
issues that would forward the gospel?<br>
<p>
Let us be careful how we deal with other people when "hot" issues come up.<br>

Why should there be any difference?  What makes us think--probably with a <br>
dash of pride--that we in the last times are any better than the generations <br>
gone before us?  <br>
On the other hand, God is a lot more flexible than we usually give him credit<br>
for being.  He can change the rules if he so chooses.  He only sees the heart.<br>
The idea that those who live past the end of probation will have a second<br>
angel to protect them or some special dose of grace does not seem to have a<br>
clear biblical basis.<br>
<p>
Nancy&gt; <br>
<i>&gt; In the last "translation faith", someone examined the question of whether </i><br>
<i>&gt; or not Jesus died for Enoch.  It was agreed that this answer was "yes."</i><br>
<i>&gt; Enoch stood no more or no less than anyone else in need of the grace of God.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yet Enoch remains, along with Elijah, one of the few to be translated to </i><br>
<i>&gt; heaven without seeing death.  Let me state what I think everyone agrees on,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then try to phrase the question more carefully.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Agreed:  There will be some in heaven for whom the work of</i><br>
<i>&gt; sanctification was not complete at the time of their death</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Agreed:  There will be some alive at the second coming who keep the</i><br>
<i>&gt; commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, examples of the fact that God</i><br>
<i>&gt; can and does save from sin.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The question:  Will all those translated (taken to heaven without seeing</i><br>
<i>&gt; death) be totally and completely sanctified before that time?  Is there</i><br>
<i>&gt; any</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference between the requirements for being translated without seeing death</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the requirements for being saved if one dies before the Second Coming?</i><br>

[Russell Yonkers, quoting S. Timm]<br>
<i>&gt; Yet Enoch remains, along with Elijah, one of the few to be translated to </i><br>
<i>&gt; heaven without seeing death.  Let me state what I think everyone agrees on,</i><br>

<i>&gt; commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, examples of the fact that God</i><br>
<i>&gt; can and does save from sin.</i><br>
<p>
I can only agree to the second statement only if that statement does not<br>
mean that the person is without sin i.e. that the person has never<br>
broken a single commandment.  <br>
<p>
Elijah, as stated above, was translated.  We do know that Elijah did<br>
fail God at times.  Thus he was not without sin.  In regards to Enoch we<br>
do not know much about his life and would be making an extreamly large<br>
error to assume that he was completely without sin!  <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The question:  Will all those translated (taken to heaven without seeing</i><br>
<i>&gt; death) be totally and completely sanctified before that time?  Is there</i><br>
<i>&gt; any</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference between the requirements for being translated without seeing death</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the requirements for being saved if one dies before the Second Coming?</i><br>
<p>
We know from the faith chapter in Hebrews that all that were saved<br>
before Jesus's first coming were saved by faith in him.  Jesus also said<br>
that it is only through him that we are saved.<br>

  <br>
If God would wait until someone never sinned in their whole life, then we <br>
would really be in trouble.  Being without sin does not mean that you have<br>
never sinned in your life, or that you by definition cannot sin.  It does <br>
mean that God's redemptive grace has worked in your life so that you choose not<br>
to sin.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The question:  Will all those translated (taken to heaven without seeing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; death) be totally and completely sanctified before that time?  Is there</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; any</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; difference between the requirements for being translated without</i><br>
seeing death<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and the requirements for being saved if one dies before the Second Coming?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We know from the faith chapter in Hebrews that all that were saved before </i><br>
<i>&gt;Jesus's first coming were saved by faith in him.  Jesus also said that it is </i><br>
<i>&gt;only through him that we are saved.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but the issue of translation, so far as I can tell, has nothing to do <br>
with salvation per se.  If being justified by faith were all that were required<br>
then why aren't we in the Kingdom already?  I think we need to see that<br>
God is more than the ambulance driver at the bottom of the cliff, picking up<br>
the pieces every time we crash.  He would like to train us to stop jumping off!<br>
<p>
I think the doctrine of justification by faith, as wonderful as it is, has led<br>
to a certain amount of idleness in the church because people were doing <br>
everything out of concern for salvation before, from diet to Ingathering, <br>
and now that they know these are not necessary for salvation they stopped doing<br>
them.  When are people going to learn that there is more than salvation to the<br>
Christian life?  (Or is there?  Talk to me!)<br>
<p>
[Nancy Vyhmeister]<br>
<i>&gt;Why should there be any difference?  What makes us think--probably with a </i><br>
<i>&gt;dash of pride--that we in the last times are any better than the generations </i><br>
<i>&gt;gone before us?  </i><br>
<p>
The world as a whole is watching Christians to see if we practice what we<br>
preach.   The answer they come up with is usually 'no'.  We're not any better<br>
than the generations that have gone before, but we need to be if the choice<br>
between God as Lord and self as lord is to be clear-cut for those who make the <br>
final decision.  We stand as much in need of the grace of God as any other<br>
generation.  I am wondering which generation will be the first to make full<br>
use of that grace and prove the truth of the Bible which affirms that God<br>
can save from sin.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The idea that those who live past the end of probation will have a second</i><br>
<i>&gt;angel to protect them or some special dose of grace does not seem to have a</i><br>
<i>&gt;clear biblical basis.</i><br>
This latter idea was put forth by Brinsmead, who claimed that some miraculous<br>
transformation was necessary just after the close of probation so that the <br>
minds of the believers would not think of sinning again.  He later turned<br>
full circle and claimed that no transformation, miraculous or otherwise, <br>
was needed.<br>
<p>
What is the significance of the seal of God?  Who will receive it?<br>
Has anyone yet received it?  And what do the 144000 have to do with all of <br>
this?  Any answers are welcome.<br>

I have read a few comments on this issue and now feel obliged to speak<br>
up a little.  We need to understand that when passionate words are used<br>
against a particular action it is done so for a reason.  Mainly, that<br>
some persons beliefs have been attacked.  While some people tend to<br>
create their beliefs more restrictive than the church has set forward,<br>
the church needs to step up and take responsibility for these problems. <br>
It was the church that set forth beliefs that exclude certain segments<br>
of the population, and the church (any church) that pushes beliefs in<br>
the first place.  Therefore, when somone wants to change these beliefs<br>
it is completely understandable for someone else to be upset it.  This<br>
person's life is based on these beliefs, and now someone wants to change<br>
these beliefs.<br>
<p>
	If the church wants a more inclusive philosophy, one that gives to<br>
society, rather than asserts answers to society, it needs to adopt a<br>
methodologically based system of theology rather than a strict belief<br>
system of theology.  We can change the beliefs so that they fit society<br>
today, but then we will run into the same problem we currently face now<br>
a little later.  The church needs to decide which system it wants.  If<br>
the church truly believes that it has the correct concept of God and how<br>
he should be worshiped then it needs to stay with the current belief<br>
system.  If on the other hand the church believes that we learn more<br>
about God as time goes on, then it should develop a methodolgical based<br>
system.  A methodological system of theology would maintian a core<br>
methodology and therefore change its outlook on others in society<br>
through time, but not lose its identity due to old beleif states. <br>
Academic disciplines survive because of this.  Physics today is not the<br>
same as it was when Newton developed "Newtonian Physics."  Neither is<br>
mathematics the same as it was before Godel refuted Hilbert in his<br>
incompleteness theorem, or economics after Herbert Simon, or chemistry<br>
after...  A core methodology defines the church not the current belief<br>
state.  This will of course shock those of us who entered the church<br>
based soley on beliefs about God and Worship services.  Specifically<br>
those who feel there is only one way to think of God and Worship him.<br>
<p>
	Something to think about.<br>

<i>&gt;One of our church members teaches at Shippensburg State.  For the last </i><br>
<i>&gt;several years she has brought the girls choir she directs there to give</i><br>
<i>&gt;us a worship service of all sacred music, and they have always been well-</i><br>
<i>&gt;received and given an appropriate program.  None of them is to my knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt;SDA.  This past spring they also brought along their gospel choir.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   . . . . deleted text</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A retired minister who was at one time our senior pastor got up while the </i><br>
<i>&gt;music was still continuing, marched up to the front of the church, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;said to the musicians "You can't do this in God's house."  He continued</i><br>
<i>&gt;to make noise and commotion until such time as the deacons restrained </i><br>
<i>&gt;him and removed him from the sanctuary.  The concert continued to its end.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   . . . . more deleted text</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Personally, I feel we are challenged to the core by this incident.  If our</i><br>
<i>&gt;church is a loving, caring, affirming church (as we declare ourselves in </i><br>
<i>&gt;our local mission statement to be)  then it is our duty to affirm this man</i><br>
<i>&gt;as our brother in the Lord and find some way to open a channel of </i><br>
<i>&gt;communication with him.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So I ask, how can you communicate with someone when the only way he knows </i><br>
<i>&gt;how to communicate is through appropriated authority?  He has worked his</i><br>
<i>&gt;     . . . . . &lt;yes more deleted text&gt;   </i><br>
<i>&gt;can we stoop to that level of using the Spirit of Prophecy as a club. </i><br>
<i>&gt;(There is in fact a Spirit of Prophecy quote against using the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Testimonies as a club, but for obvious reasons it can't be used against</i><br>
<i>&gt;anybody.) </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We will not build consensus and be of one accord by running roughshod</i><br>
<i>&gt;over any segment of the population of our church.  Yet the</i><br>
<i>&gt;misrepresentation of </i><br>
<i>&gt;God to 40 young people from Shippensburg plus other visitors that were</i><br>
<i>&gt;there is severe and we need to make sure it doesn't happen again.  Any</i><br>
<i>&gt;suggestions</i><br>
<i>&gt;are helpful.  I would appreciate if people would focus on the issue of</i><br>
<i>&gt;communication and not on whether the outrage over wild music was</i><br>
<i>&gt;justified or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Steve Timm</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Steve,<br>
I think what was missed out is with BOTH groups - the liberals and the so<br>
called conservatives.  We all know the inclinations of our congregations<br>
and we know how people will feel when we bring a particular outside group<br>
into the church.  So, why not hold a meeting before bringing in the group.<br>
If it does not appear like the congregation wants the Shippensburg choir<br>
to come because of their guitars and drums, take the choir to the nearby<br>
church that can tolerate those musical instruments and hold a joint function<br>
to praise the Lord.<br>
<p>
In every situation, someone has to give in and yet if there is to be a<br>
blessing in what is being planned, then we have to move forward with it.<br>
<p>
If a new musical instrument is created in this decade, will out conservatives<br>
claim that EGW and the other "pioneers" did not worship with such instruments<br>
so we should not employ such instrument in our services?<br>
<p>
I think you need to convince the youth that the old pastor should not be<br>
disfellowshipped.  They may convey to him their opinion on what he did is<br>
not positive but they have to learn to tolerate him.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think the doctrine of justification by faith, as wonderful as it is, has led</i><br>
<i>&gt; to a certain amount of idleness in the church because people were doing </i><br>
<i>&gt; everything out of concern for salvation before, from diet to Ingathering, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and now that they know these are not necessary for salvation they stopped doing</i><br>
<i>&gt; them.  When are people going to learn that there is more than salvation to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christian life?  (Or is there?  Talk to me!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
[Russell Yonkers]<br>
<p>
One of the problems that many people have is that they have forgotten<br>
that we are to have a relationship with God not just have our<br>
salvation ticket signed by his son.  Relationships mean that<br>
we modify behavior, that we work at becomming better persons.<br>
Too often we figure that in ANY relationship we can sit around idle<br>
and not grow into the relationship and the other person.  People<br>
have the wrong idea that God is some sort of pill that one can just<br>
t take and be saved. .  It is just like my relationship with my wife<br>
If I have things that I do that bother her I will change.  Not because<br>
she forces me to but because I lover her and want to make her happy.  <br>
My kids act the same way toward me.  (Well most of the time). <br>
Of course there are times that they do something just to upset me but<br>
for the most part they want to make me happy. <br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
I have been requested to substantiate my previous post asserting <br>
an affirmative reply to Steves question below. I was also recommended<br>
to post these on SDAnet for all to judge and so I shall.<br>
<p>
I ask each of you to _fully_ read this very carefully. If ever there was<br>
present truth then this certainly qualifies.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The question:  Will all those translated (taken to heaven without seeing</i><br>
<i>&gt; death) be totally and completely sanctified before that time?  Is there</i><br>
<i>&gt; any</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference between the requirements for being translated without seeing death</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the requirements for being saved if one dies before the Second Coming?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
An in another email Steve writes :<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What is the significance of the seal of God?  Who will receive it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Has anyone yet received it?  And what do the 144000 have to do with all of </i><br>
<i>&gt;this?  Any answers are welcome.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Well now where do I start ?<br>
<p>
Well we know that the 144000 are those who have received the seal of God.<br>
Rev 7:3-4 and who are alive on the earth when Jesus comes and they have <br>
perfected Christian characters Rev 14:4-5.<br>
<p>
We also know that these have perfected Christ-like characters BEFORE<br>
Jesus comes because 1 John 3:2-3 tells us that <br>
	"Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear<br>
what we shall be: but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like <br>
Him: for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in <br>
him purifieth himself, even as he is pure." <br>
<p>
Please note that it does not say we shall be made like him at His appearing.<br>
it says we _shall_ be like him, because we have been purified.<br>
<p>
Likewise Zech and Isa tell us about a time when God Himself will work <br>
wonderfully on behalf of His people such that Mal 3:3 tells us that<br>
"He shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver, <br>
that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness."<br>
<p>
This purification is to take place in our lives now so that when He appears<br>
we shall be like he is in character.<br>
<p>
We also know that the time is coming when the Lord will say <br>
"He that is righteous, let him be righteous still and he that is holy<br>
let him be holy still..." Rev 22:11-12 and we know that this happens when<br>
Jesus stand up in Dan 12:1 from the investigative judgement outlined in <br>
Daniel and leaves the mercy seat in the most holy place in the sanctuary.<br>
The intercessory censor is cast to the ground Rev 8:5 indicating an end of <br>
intercession for sin, smoke fills the heavenly temple Rev 15:8, so that<br>
no one can enter and intercede on behalf of man and the time of trouble<br>
as there never was begins Dan 12:1 and Rev 16:1.<br>
<p>
Now we know that Jesus role in the heavenly sanctuary is that of forgiving<br>
sin as our high priest 1 John 2:1, Heb 4:14-16, Heb 7:24-27, Heb 8:1-5.<br>
Please note that your (and my) sins were not forgiven ~2000 years ago, yes the<br>
sacrifice was made for them but how can a sin be forgiven that has not<br>
yet been committed ? No, Jesus now forgives sin (He is now able to becuase<br>
of His sacrifice which He has already made ) not before we ask him<br>
but when we ask him because this is His role as our advocate and High Priest<br>
to forgive our sins.<br>
<p>
Now when our priest stops officiating on our behalf there can be no more<br>
forgiveness of sin obviously. So that if we sin after this time (close of<br>
probation) we can not be forgiven because there will be nobody there<br>
to forgive us our sins. Obviously if we have unforgiven sins then we are<br>
eternally lost. what then does this suggest regarding those who live <br>
at the time when there will be no mediator in the heavenly sanctuary ?<br>
<p>
<p>
Anyway there are many more texts in the scriptures which show these same<br>
things. Now I will present some of the things that EGW wrote regarding<br>
translation faith and the sealing and the close of probation.<br>
<p>
<p>
After the close of probation, "there will be no priest in the sanctuary<br>
to offer their sacrifices, their confessions, and their prayers before the<br>
Father's throne." (EW 48) " I saw that many did not realise what they must<br>
be in order to live in the sight of the Lord without a high Priest in the<br>
sanctuary in the time of trouble. Those who receive the seal of the living <br>
God and are protected in the time of trouble must reflect the image of<br>
Jesus fully.... There will be no time then to do it and no mediator to <br>
plead their cause before the Father" (EW 71) "Those who are living upon <br>
the earth when the intercession of Christ shall cease in the sanctuary<br>
above are to stand in the sight of a holy God without a mediator. Their <br>
robes must be spotless, their characters must be purified from sin by the <br>
blood of sprinkling. Through the grace of God and their own diligent effort<br>
they must be conquerors in the battle with evil." (GC 425)<br>
<p>
Please read the above quotations prayerfully again and consider well the <br>
full import of what she says.<br>
<p>
Here is some more ....<br>
<p>
"The rapidly diminishing space of time between us and eternity should<br>
more deeply impress us. Each day that passes makes one less left to us<br>
to complete our work of perfecting character ....." 5T 451<br>
<p>
"When he comes it is not to cleans us of our sins, to remove from us <br>
the defects in our characters, or to cure us of the infirmities of our <br>
tempers and dispositions. If wrought for us at all, this work shall be <br>
accomplished before that time. When the Lord comes those who are holy will<br>
be holy still. Those who have preserved theire bodies and spirits in holiness<br>
in sanctification and honour, will then receive the finishing touch of <br>
immortality. But those who are unjust, unsanctified and filthy will remain<br>
so forever. No work will then be done for them to remove their defects<br>
and give them holy characters. The refiner does not then sit to pursue<br>
His refining process and remove their sins and corruption. This is all to <br>
be done in these hours of probation. It is NOW that this work is to be <br>
accomplished for us." 2T 355,356<br>
<p>
"The time of trouble such as never was, is soon to open upon us; and we<br>
shall need an experience which we do not now posses, and which many are too<br>
indolent to obtain. It is often the case that trouble is greater in <br>
anticipation than in reality; but this is not true of the crisis before us.<br>
The most vivid presentation cannot reach the magnitude of the ordeal. And <br>
now, while the precious saviour is making an atonement for us, we should seek<br>
to become perfect in Christ....None can neglect or defer this work but at the <br>
most fearful peril to their souls." (Ev 704)<br>
<p>
"The season of distress and anguish before us will require a faith that can <br>
endure weariness, delay, and hunger - a faith that will not faint though <br>
severely tried. The period of probation is granted to all to prepare for<br>
that time..."  1 T 268<br>
<p>
"Are we seeking for His fullness, ever pressing toward the mark set before <br>
us-- the perfection of His character ? When the Lord's people reach this<br>
mark, they will be sealed in their forheads. Filled with the Spirit, they<br>
will be complete in Christ and the recoding angel will declare, 'It is<br>
finished.'" 6 BC 1118<br>
<p>
As you can plainly see the answer to Steve's question is affirmative.<br>
Yes we do require a faith which we do not now posses and many are too<br>
indolent to obtain - the Faith of Jesus. Rev 14:12.<br>
<p>
<p>
And there is much, much more of this in the SoP. To much for me<br>
to give an exaustive list. However just a few more pointers for those who <br>
wish: under 'Probation' in the EGW index we find<br>

Raylene,<br>
<p>
I became an Adventist three years after hearing some evangelistic<br>
meetings.  I was quite astounded by the things I heard and saw in the<br>
Bible:  in particular the Sabbath and the view of eschatology.  I guess my<br>
feeling at the time was that since this was what the Bible really said,<br>
then it must be true.  Some how that doesn't make sense to me now.  I<br>
guess part of it was also this impression that the unfilled spots in my<br>
previous years of spiritual wandering were being fulfilled.  As I have<br>
grown, I have taken a step back to redefine why I am an Adventist and to<br>
see why I believe what I believe.  I firmlly believe that the God who was<br>
with me as a young man before I was a Christian has led me to the Bible as<br>
His written revelation to humanity.  As such I ought to believe what it<br>
says and ought not to take flights of fancy to traditions.  I believe that<br>
the Adventist Chruch is the only environment in which I can be with fellow<br>
believers and do this.  What other body of people on earth believes what<br>
we believe?  I see that what we preach is what the Bible says.  Although I<br>
question the firmness of some of the details concerning our beliefs (such<br>
as the millenium), I find that in the Adventist church there exists this<br>
dynamism where you search the Bible continually for truth.  You don't stop<br>
questioning yourself about what the Bible says (though the amount of<br>
question may decrease in some cases).  The founders of this denomination<br>
went to the Bible with a fresh mind to see what it had to say, and they<br>
allowed the Spirit to convict them of the truth.  This element I find very<br>
positive about the Adventist Church.  That and the true workers of the<br>
Lord that I meet in fellowship (and join in service with) are why I am<br>
still and Adventist today.<br>

Steve,<br>
<p>
Doesn't the verses about faith without works is dead answer some of your<br>
perplexity about the Christian life and what we do after we have<br>
justification by faith?  Justification by faith is not justification for<br>
me to be idle, but it is the call for us to serve our Lord.  Remember the<br>
judgment will be one of works.  We must ask ourselves if we have allowed<br>
God to hang some fruit on us the branch?  Or have we said it is nice to be<br>
a branch, but don't hang nothing on me?  When one looks to the "faith"<br>
chapter of Hebrews one ought to notice that each of the people outlined<br>
preformed some action.  The action demonstrated their faith as being true.<br>
I little about this issue of whether the last generation will be somehow<br>
without sin and able to do no wrong, but I do know that we must say not I,<br>
but Christ and allow him to do in our lives the work he was able to do in<br>
his own.<br>
<p>
Ian.<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
Did any of you catch the article in this weeks TIME magazine about new<br>
discoveries from the Dead Sea Scrolls?  The writer implies that this new<br>
information will either help the "liberals" who say the Gospels were written<br>
in the 2nd Century AD or "conversatives" who identify 1st Century dating.<br>
Interesting, there is now evidence that some of the Qumran manuscripts<br>
were written BEFORE Christ, as early as 200 BC.  There are several quotes<br>
almost identical to words of Christ.  Probably the only thing these<br>
"scholars" do agree on is that these new manuscripts emphasize the "Jewishness"<br>
of Jesus Christ.<br>
<p>
I'd like to hear any comments you may have on this.<br>
<p>

On the netnews board soc.religion.christian there has been quite<br>
an active discussion going on regarding the claim of one scholar<br>
that two fragments of papyrus found at Qumran bear parts of the New Testament,<br>
thus dating it before Qumran was taken over by the Romans in the AD 60's.<br>
But these are very small fragments and it's hard to tell for sure.<br>
Many scholars are adamantly opposed to this view.<br>

For some interesting reading on a "un-hero" (or on again off again hero)<br>
browse Little Richard's bio.  in your local book store  <br>
(its !! PINK !! very bright) in the rock artist<br>
section or maybe in the non-fiction biography. Anyway he talks about his<br>
heros: E.E. Cleveland, HMS Richards Sr. and others.<br>

I have certainly been inspired by the delightful biographies of the<br>
network family on-line. Those of you other lingerers and lurkers,<br>
follow my example and post yours as well.<br>
<p>
I'm a second year Ph.D. student at the University of Tennessee in<br>
communications, journalism public relations and information science.<br>
The focus of my research is on electronic information, specifically<br>
the National Research and Education Network (NREN) established by<br>
Sen. Gore's High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 signed by Pres.<br>
Bush December 9, 1991. I am researching policy and legal issues including<br>
access, equity, intellectual property, privacy, censorship and the<br>
impact these will have on the communications industry.<br>
<p>
I graduated from Southern College of SDA (Southern Missionary College)<br>
in 1975, earned a master's in Libraries and Information Science from<br>
Vanderbilt University in 1979, spent my early career teaching English,<br>
speech, journalism, then became a magazine editor, newspaper reporter<br>
and editor, and worked in corporate communications.<br>
<p>
I am assistant professor of journalism and communnication on a two-<br>
year study leave from Southern College where I teach advanced<br>
expository writing, persuasion and propaganda, public relations<br>
theory, case studies and techniques, and public speaking.<br>
<p>
One of the nicest experiences that has happened to me at UTK has<br>
been related to this net. When Steve posted the directory, I was<br>
surprised to find someone else from my university on the net. I<br>
sent her an e-mail message. Later, in arranging for a class I<br>
teach (Writing for the Mass Media) to visit the library, who should<br>
it be that I make arrangements with? Jeanette Prescod, who is on<br>
this list. She is Government Documents Coordinator of the University<br>
of Tennessee Libraries and I told her this morning she needs to post<br>
her bio on the net.<br>
<p>
The Knoxville SDA Church has purchased the former home of the<br>
University President and operates a wonderful Advent House for<br>
Adventist students. Ron Pickell has an active outreach and students<br>
find a welcome place to visit, eat, worship, and live. More on this<br>
successful program if you'd like to hear about it. I'm writing an<br>
article for the Adventist Review about this Adventist University<br>
outreach.<br>
<p>
Last week at church I met two Adventist students. Vanessa Ruf<br>
discovered on her way to the University that Hurricane Andrew was<br>
hitting her hometown of Florida City. She lost her home. This<br>
was a front-page story in the University's daily newspaper.<br>
The other Adventist student, Gretchen Grimaud, is the discus-<br>
throwing champion from Pennsylvania and a member of UT's track<br>
team. The team has changed dates for their meets to accommodate<br>
her Sabbath-keeping schedule. The national dates have also been<br>
changed to accommodate her. The University of Tennessee was the<br>
only university to accommodate Gretchen. But UT has been known<br>
for its track team and its students' success in the Olympics.<br>
<p>
Spiritual Biography: I gave my heart to Jesus at camp at age 10.<br>
It's been a wonderful love affair. I have found answers to my<br>
questions about the faith/works issues, reaching perfection before<br>
Christ comes, and righteousness by a constant study of Galatians<br>
and Romans. Paul has addressed these issues eloquently.<br>
<p>
I just recently joined the net and am delighted to be on board.<br>
In fact, I hope to write about this network for an Adventist<br>
publication. It's exciting and one of the only places where<br>
one can have such pertinent conversations with so many far-flung<br>
brothers and sisters.<br>

I have been experiencing quite some internal conflict over the issues<br>
raised in this discussion. This is clearly a good thing, since you only<br>
really learn and grow through internal conflict! (Cognitive dissonance<br>
I believe is a related term which educational theorists like.)<br>
<p>
After reading Ruben's last post, I decided it was high time I made an<br>
effort to sort this out for myself. I have subsequently spent a few hours<br>
speaking with various people, and reading Biblical and SoP passages referred<br>
to by Ruben, as well as some useful references which were given to me.<br>
<p>
I am far from being able to post anything myself which I could hope to<br>
back up, but I would like to share some references with others reading<br>
the discussion who may be as disturbed about the issue as myself.<br>
<p>
The most outstanding treatment I have found is a chapter in George Knight's <br>
extremely recent book. The book is entitled "The Pharisee's Guide to Perfect<br>
Holiness", and Chapter 9 is "Perfection and the Final Generation". So far<br>
I have only been able to read a photocopy of chapter 9, but as soon as<br>
the stores open after the weekend I will be purchasing the book. I give<br>
this material my strongest recommendation, as it is helping me understand<br>
just what all those quotes Ruben gave are trying to say to me.<br>
<p>
I also have a book called "Perfection. The Impossible Possibility" by<br>
Douglass, Heppenstall, La Rondelle and Maxwell. This one I haven't had<br>
a chance to read yet, but apparently the four authors each present their<br>
own treatments on the issue of perfection, with Douglass and Maxwell aligned<br>
with one view, and Heppenstall and La Rondelle with another. This material<br>
is probably not as specific to the translation faith discussion as the<br>
chapter by Knight, but it looks like it may be helpful all the same.<br>
Particularly when it comes to understanding what White meant when she<br>
referred to perfection, Christ's character and so on.<br>
<p>
Other references are the following papers.<br>
<p>
Polglase, J., "Doubly Perfect"<br>
Tolhurst, L.P., "Perfection of character and perfection of nature"<br>
Ford, D., "When probation closes: Absolute loyalty or absolute sinlessness?"<br>
<p>
I don't know where or even if these were published, my pastor had copies<br>
of them on file from the late 60s early 70s when they were written. For<br>
anyone concerned about the authorship of some of these, they were written<br>
well before any of the controversy which later ensued. <br>
<p>
If anybody does want copies of these papers, maybe I could type them in <br>
after I hand in my research project, or perhaps even mail you a copy.<br>
Both of these options are a bit of a pain, so don't ask unless you are<br>
really dead-set serious!<br>
<p>
I should say in closing that this discussion has actually done more to<br>
help my spiritual growth than anything in my recent past. And I really<br>
do recommend that book by George Knight! I believe the Lord is using this<br>
man to speak to our church.<br>

About a year ago you recall that I posted my feelings on going back to the<br>
church in which I grew up and being shocked to find it had liberalized.<br>
Again I went to Michigan over the weekend, again for a wedding, visiting <br>
a different SDA church which shall remain nameless (but not the one in <br>
which I grew up.)  <br>
<p>
I remembered the pastor from my days in Michigan--after a fairly successful<br>
career in business he had begun working as first a singing evangelist for<br>
a large Voice Of Prophecy crusade.  Twenty years later, he is still in the <br>
ministry, singing the same songs he sung then (and singing them better,<br>
I might add, his singing has actually improved with age.)  After a rousing<br>
rendition of "The Great Judgment Day" in song, he proceeded to preach on <br>
the seven last plagues, and the division of Babylon, and all those other <br>
good Adventist eschatology topics about which we hardly hear anymore.<br>
<p>
This and other impressions of the day at church left me with the impression<br>
that there are many churches who still live in the early 70's and like <br>
it that way.  Given the description of the "establishment" that runs this<br>
particular local church, I don't doubt that they wanted a pastor just like<br>
this man.  <br>
<p>
But then I thought a bit more:  What, if anything, was necessarily wrong<br>
with the church of the 70's?  We speak of the failed techniques of the past,<br>
but have they failed because they were essentially flawed or because people<br>
just stopped trying them?  I suspect the latter, because if we look in <br>
the Black and Spanish churches of today, these techniques are still being<br>
used and are flourishing.  In the early 70's the above pastor was part<br>
of a city-wide Voice of Prophecy effort where churches of both conferences<br>
cooperated.  The church growth which grew out of that hasn't been seen <br>
in that town in the twenty years since that time.  <br>
<p>
As the "new ideas" people claim that it is time for change, we need to <br>
ask as did Clara Peller and Walter Mondale, "Where's the beef?"  We need <br>
to remember that sometimes the older generation is resistant to change<br>
because they have seen the old ways work and know they could work again<br>
if given new blood.<br>
<p>
Often inside churches such as the one above I am forced to turn on my<br>
"Affirm" mode and continuously mutter to myself that these folks are<br>
my brothers and sisters in the Lord and that their way of worship is no <br>
better or worse than mine.  After such a weekend I think that this process<br>
is probably good for me.<br>

I agree with your thought -- not necessarily your opinion -- that the<br>
techniques of the 70's were not flawed.  If tried now they still work,<br>
and produce more dedicated church members than those drawn in by<br>
other methods that I see used now.<br>

Do I understand that there are two sets of divine expectations?  One is<br>
for those who get run over by a train two weeks after meeting Christ--and<br>
really, the standard is only to have accepted Christ's grace and forgiveness.<br>
The other is for those who have the fortune--whether good or bad--to be alive<br>
in the end days: total perfection and ability to stand on their own during<br>
the time of trouble.<br>
<p>
I'm troubled about the dichotomy.  Does this make for first and second class<br>
citizens?  Does God have different rulers to measure us by?  Is it not pre-<br>
sumption to think that I can do anything by myself, let alone depend on myself,<br>
with no help from Christ, during the time of trouble?  <br>
<p>
Do we really understand what it means to be without a mediator?  In the Old<br>
Testament times Christ was not functioning as now in the Sanctuary, yet we are<br>
clearly told that all the OT worthies were saved as they depended on Christ.<br>

<i>&gt; The only two people that have really posted much on this, (me and Ruben)</i><br>
<i>&gt; seem to agree that the time of the end while we are living without a </i><br>
<i>&gt; mediator in the heavenly sanctuary will require a special kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; righteousness, a full and complete salvation from sin which most of us</i><br>
<i>&gt; do not yet possess.</i><br>
<p>
	I agree also.  I just haven't been too vocal.  I've got a few<br>
other thoughts that go along that line that I haven't finnished putting<br>
together yet.  Maybe I'll post them when I do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So we are faced with a dilemma:  Not only should we seek to have Christ work</i><br>
<i>&gt; in our lives, but it needs to be for the right reasons, not the selfish</i><br>
<i>&gt; ones listed above.  Ideas on how to resolve this?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Steve Timm</i><br>
<p>
	I REALLY wish I could provide a reference for this, but *sigh*,<br>
I'm inbetween Desire of Ages books and don't have one with me at the moment.<br>
Maybe someone could find it and give the exact quotation, but a paraphrase<br>
goes something like:<br>
<p>
	It is impossible for thoughts of selfishness to flurish in the<br>
mind where the scenes of calvary are kept fresh.<br>
<p>
	I know this is true from personal experience.<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
Perhaps one reason there have not been many posts on the issue of perfection<br>
before translation is because this doctrine is under doubt by many SDAs.  I<br>
have had at least 4 SDA pastors tell me they personally could not teach this<br>
doctrine because of their own personal doubts but they had not come out with<br>
a public denouncement of it for obvious reasons.<br>
<p>
One reason I began to doubt this doctrine myself was the fact that the NT<br>
apostles did not seem to be concerned about attaining perfection.  Thye<br>
(They) sincerely believed the Jesus Christ would return very soon (in their<br>
generation).  But none of these seem to be preoccupied with purging their<br>
personal lives of sin.  Rather, they were feverishly trying to fulfill the<br>
gospel commission--to take the gospel to every tongue, kindred, and people.<br>
<p>
Paul aptly describes the human condition in Romans 3:9-18:<br>
<p>
	What then?  are we better than they?  No, in no wise:  for we<br>
	have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all<br>
	under sin;  AS IT IS WRITTEN&lt; THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NO, NOT<br>
	ONE;  There is none that understandeth, there is none that<br>
	seeketh after God.  They are all gone out of the way, they are<br>
	together become unprofitable; THERE IS NONE THAT DOETH GOOD, NO<br>
	NOT ONE.  Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues<br>
	they have used deceit;  the poison of asps is under their lips;<br>
	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; Their feet are<br>
	swift to shed blood:  Destruction and misery are in their ways:<br>
	And the way of peave have they not known; There is no fear of<br>
	God before their eyes.<br>
<p>
Paul also laments his own weaknesses and shortcomings.  He knows he is<br>
fully committed to the gospel of Jesus Christ yet finds himself failing.<br>
This is during the supposed "last generation".<br>
<p>
I believe that all Christians need to quit introspecting about their<br>
personal spiritual condition and just live a victorious Christian life.<br>
Seek forgiveness when we fail, repenting of cherished personal sin, and<br>
moving toward fulfilling the great gospel commission.  Does it really<br>
matter to individuals whether they believe perfection is attainable on<br>
this earth or NOT?  If we look towards ourselves rather than our Savior<br>
we will certainly lose.  I believe this net discuss then meaning of the<br>
word perfection in the past.  The fact that it means complete for the<br>
level of development, whole rather than deformed.  Thus we can all be<br>
perfect in complete submission to Christ.  We can all be whole in perfect<br>
love for Him.  The application of the word to being "sinless, not sinnig<br>
(sinning) anymore" cannot be supported by the Bible.  Look to the Bible<br>
and find out what it, not the writings of other writers.<br>

We currently serve a number of Compuserve users.  Recently Russell Grau<br>
sent me a message from his America Online account, proving that SDAnet<br>
can also reach America Online.  So if you have any friends on America<br>
Online, let them know about SDAnet.<br>
<p>
I believe similar connections are available to Genie and Prodigy, but <br>
I don't know anyone to send mail to on those nets to check it out.<br>
If anyone has access to either of these two nets, can you do some<br>
research?<br>
<p>
Also for our BBS-like friends out in Fidonet land, it is certainly possible<br>
for me to mail to people in Fidonet.  We almost had something going<br>
but then I never heard from the person who was going to set it up.<br>
If any other Fidonet people are out there, let us know.  We want to <br>
broaden access as much as possible.\<br>

Nancy Vyhmeister raises some good points.  I can't speak for what Ruben <br>
is arguing--if I understand his point correctly he would probably say that<br>
the standard of complete and total obedience is required of everyone.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, I was implying almost what Nancy has accused me of<br>
implying.  The whole question I am trying to ask is "Are there extra <br>
requirements on those who will be translated alive, which have nothing<br>
to do with their salvation?"<br>
<p>
And everyone is answering "No, in whatever age you are only saved by faith."<br>
<p>
Now I say again, "Could it be that the issues of translation and salvation<br>
are separate issues?  Could it be that sanctification and salvation are<br>
separate issues?"  In Adventist circles (as with almost all other circles)<br>
we tend to focus myopically on our own salvation and ignore all other <br>
matters as unimportant.  <br>
<p>
Please, if I am wrong and these things are not separate, let me know.<br>
But don't answer questions that I'm not asking.<br>
<p>
Now to what Cheryl said--a very enlightened comment.  The apostles<br>
didn't sit and write about whether they  were perfect or not.  They<br>
spent their time <br>
serving others and sharing the gospel with them.  In my mind, this is the<br>
perfect expression of perfection, being able to love God and your neighbor<br>
as yourself.  So we find that perfection may at times best be attained <br>
through neglect of thought on the topic.<br>

The only two people that have really posted much on this, (me and Ruben)<br>
seem to agree that the time of the end while we are living without a <br>
mediator in the heavenly sanctuary will require a special kind of<br>
righteousness, a full and complete salvation from sin which most of us<br>
do not yet possess.  Most of us are also acquainted with statements from<br>
Ellen G.<br>
White which indicate that some of those for whom the time of trouble would<br>
be too traumatic will die shortly before the time of trouble.<br>
<p>
Two attitudes can arise from this knowledge, and I have personally heard <br>
them both.<br>
<p>
(1)  I could never be ready for the time of trouble, so I hope I die <br>
before it ever comes.<br>
<p>
(2)  I want to get all sin out of my life so I can go straight to heaven<br>
and not go via the "Underground Railroad" (death).<br>
<p>
So we are faced with a dilemma:  Not only should we seek to have Christ work<br>
in our lives, but it needs to be for the right reasons, not the selfish<br>
ones listed above.  Ideas on how to resolve this?<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Do I understand that there are two sets of divine expectations?  </i><br>
<p>
Nope there has only ever been 1 divine expectation, the same that<br>
was expected of Adam, perfect obedience to the law of God.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One is</i><br>
<i>&gt;for those who get run over by a train two weeks after meeting Christ--and</i><br>
<i>&gt;really, the standard is only to have accepted Christ's grace and forgiveness.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
However the condition of salvation is the acceptance of the GRACE of God <br>
through faith as manifest in His Son. This grace not only forgives<br>
but transforms those who permit it into the likeness of Christ thus<br>
enabling them to conform to the divine expectation.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The other is for those who have the fortune--whether good or bad--to be alive</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the end days: total perfection and ability to stand on their own during</i><br>
<i>&gt;the time of trouble.</i><br>
<p>
Nope ! nobody has or ever will be able to "stand on their own".<br>
It is only "Christ in you" those who can say for a truth "nevertheless<br>
I live, yet not I but Christ who liveth in me." that will stand<br>
in that day. Not in their own strength but in Christ's revealing to the <br>
world the power of Christ to save from all sin. Does not Paul make this <br>
very clear in Rom 7 and 8 that man/woman in his/her own strenght <br>
(I alone/ego autos) [Rom 7:25] can never obey the law of God, however in <br>
Christ [Rom 8:1]  all things are possible.<br>
<p>
And it is a priviledge to live in those day when God's power will be so <br>
manifest. Don't we wish to overcome sin through God's power, what greater<br>
blessing could God give.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm troubled about the dichotomy.  Does this make for first and second class</i><br>
<i>&gt;citizens?  Does God have different rulers to measure us by? </i><br>
There is no dichitomy those who are really saved by grace will experience<br>
God's transforming power. Those who are not transformed by God's grace<br>
simply have not experienced it. In that time when God's grace will be poured<br>
out without measure upon His children, their transformation will be complete<br>
into His own likeness.<br>
<p>
It is the same ruler, the condition is to be on that path which Isa says<br>
"shineth more and more unto the perfect day". Whether we have just begun this<br>
journey or have nearly completed it does not determine salvation. Being on that<br>
path does. Did not JEsus teach this very thing with His parable of the 11th<br>
hour labourers, the amount of work completed by the labourers was not important<br>
the important thing was that they had done work and all received the same<br>
wages.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is it not pre-</i><br>
<i>&gt;sumption to think that I can do anything by myself, let alone depend on myself,</i><br>
<i>&gt;with no help from Christ, during the time of trouble?  </i><br>
<p>
Yep presumption indeed. Who said anything about doing anything by ourselves ?<br>
I certainly did not, neither does EGW. Lets not impose our own preconceptions.<br>
<p>
Only as Christ dwells in your heart "making you to will and to do of His good <br>
pleasure" (can't remember ref, in NT) does not Isa 26:12 say<br>
<p>
"Lord thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou has wrought all our works in us"<br>
<p>
In fact read all of Isa 26 because it certainly is refering to this very time<br>
we speak about.<br>
<p>
So how many righteous works does a person do of him/herself. None. <br>
However when Christ lives in us, He does the works in us, without<br>
Christ we can do nothing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Do we really understand what it means to be without a mediator?  In the Old</i><br>
<i>&gt;Testament times Christ was not functioning as now in the Sanctuary, yet we are</i><br>
<i>&gt;clearly told that all the OT worthies were saved as they depended on Christ.</i><br>
<p>
No, He was not functioning as now in the most holy place you are correct,<br>
but they certainly did not live through the close of probation either.<br>
<p>
They were saved - like Enoch by faith in God's grace just like us. How <br>
do you think Enoch attained perfection of character ? He certainly did not<br>
do it by himself, relying on his own efforts apart from God.<br>
<p>

Cheryl writes :<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;One reason I began to doubt this doctrine myself was the fact that the NT</i><br>
<i>&gt;apostles did not seem to be concerned about attaining perfection. </i><br>
<p>
I'm sorry Cheryl but I just can not ignore the scripture when the Apostles,<br>
Paul and Jesus say : <br>
<p>
1 John 3:1 "My little children, these things I write unto you that you sin not."<br>
<p>
Matt 5:48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is<br>
          perfect. (KJV)<br>
<p>
2 Tim 3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for<br>
           doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in<br>
           righteousness: (KJV)<br>
2 Tim 3:17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all<br>
           good works. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Matt 19:26 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is<br>
           impossible; but with God all things are possible. (KJV)<br>
<p>
1 Thes 5:23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your<br>
            whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the<br>
            coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Heb 6:1 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go<br>
        on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from<br>
        dead works, and of faith toward God, (KJV)<br>
<p>
Jude 1:24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present<br>
          you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,<br>
<p>
Rev 3:21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even<br>
         as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.<br>
<p>

What, if anything, was necessarily wrong<br>
with the church of the 70's?  We speak of the failed techniques of the past,<br>
but have they failed because they were essentially flawed or because people<br>
just stopped trying them?  I suspect the latter, because if we look in <br>
the Black and Spanish churches of today, these techniques are still being<br>
used and are flourishing.  In the early 70's the above pastor was part<br>
of a city-wide Voice of Prophecy effort where churches of both conferences<br>
cooperated.  The church growth which grew out of that hasn't been seen <br>
in that town in the twenty years since that time.  <br>
<p>
As the "new ideas" people claim that it is time for change, we need to <br>
ask as did Clara Peller and Walter Mondale, "Where's the beef?"  We need <br>
to remember that sometimes the older generation is resistant to change<br>
because they have seen the old ways work and know they could work again<br>
if given new blood.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
Dave adds:<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
I agree with your thought -- not necessarily your opinion -- that the<br>
techniques of the 70's were not flawed.  If tried now they still work,<br>
and produce more dedicated church members than those drawn in by<br>
other methods that I see used now.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
<p>
Now my turn:<br>
<p>
As Steve said, the traditional approach is clearly still extremely <br>
successful, as evidenced by the strong church growth amongst Black and<br>
Spanish churches where this approach is usually taken.<br>
<p>
Dave points out that people who are converted by the traditional techniques<br>
tend to be more dedicated to the church. I would propose that this is a<br>
function of the people rather than of the way they were witnessed to.<br>
<p>
Take the example of the traditional SDA evangelist who emphatically preaches<br>
on prophecy and end-time events. He is clearly convinced that what he is<br>
saying is right, and by his own personal charisma and the influence of the<br>
Holy Spirit others are often convinced of the same thing. Some people respond<br>
extremely well to this kind of approach, which goes from strength to strength<br>
and is confident and clear all the way.<br>
<p>
Others will look on and judge the evangelist to be dogmatic, one-sided and<br>
unrealistic. They will notice that he makes no bones about the fact that his<br>
view is the only correct one, and that others are clearly wrong. The absence<br>
of contentious issues will be noticed by them, and they will wonder whether<br>
the evangelist has ever considered these issues from all directions.<br>
<p>
Those converted by the evangelist will be very clear on what they believe,<br>
and will probably be very committed to Christ and the church. They will be<br>
the sort of people who like to hear a good traditional Adventist sermon from<br>
the pulpit, one that reminds them that they are right in their beliefs and<br>
that the SDA church is God's remnant faithful few. Disagreements over various<br>
areas of belief will confuse and upset these people, as they know how good<br>
it is to feel sure of what you believe.<br>
<p>
The others, those who didn't really identify with the evangelist, may become<br>
converted through another means. Perhaps it will be through a fine Christian<br>
friend they have who is willing to discuss things with them. Either way, these<br>
people are by nature always searching and testing. Although the onlooker may<br>
judge them to be less committed to the church than the more dogmatic believer,<br>
they tend to have a very strong personal faith which is not upset by small<br>
differences, and which is open to examination.<br>
<p>
I think there is a place for everyone in God's church, and I don't think he<br>
expects any of us to suddenly become somebody we're not. He created us<br>
individuals. By insisting that the old ways are the only ways, we are<br>
restricting our witness to the sorts of people who respond to those ways.<br>
By insisting that the old ways are outdated and that we must change, we are<br>
again narrowing our focus to particular kinds of people.<br>
<p>
Interestingly, the church progressed for many years using only certain types<br>
of evangelism. We should hardly be surprised when those who were converted<br>
during that time insist that the old ways are the best ways! I suspect that<br>
much of the motivation for trying new things is coming from people who<br>
were born into the church rather than being converted into it.<br>

<i>&gt;I'm sorry Cheryl but I just can not ignore the scripture when the Apostles,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Paul and Jesus say : </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;1 John 3:1 "My little children, these things I write unto you that</i><br>
<i>&gt;	     you sin not."</i><br>
<p>
..... (Lots of biblical references deleted for brevity.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Ruben.</i><br>
<p>
{Ruben, please don't take this as a personal attack, I'm just trying<br>
to post a warning for all Christians.  I am just using this verse of<br>
this posting as an example of a bigger danger.}<br>
<p>
We've got to be more careful how we handle the Scriptures than this.<br>
We all know the dangers of taking verses out of context, yet it is so<br>
easy to do (I know that I often do it also, I only have certain verses<br>
memorized).<br>
<p>
In context, I John is much more complex than this posting would imply.<br>
For example, in 1:8-2:2, John specifically states that everyone sins.<br>
Anyone who won't admit it is deceiving themselves.<br>
<p>
Later, in 3:6, it says "No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins<br>
has seen Him or knows Him." <br>
<p>
 From this we have very few options: either we assume that John was a<br>
schizophrenic who should have been locked up rather than followed as<br>
an Apostle (clearly an untenable position for a Christian who has <br>
already examined the truth of what the Bible claims).<br>
<p>
Or we assume that there is a complexity here that must be investigated<br>
to truly understand what John was getting at.  (The few commentaries <br>
that I've read state that this should be read as a reaction to the <br>
Gnostic heresy.)<br>
<p>
<p>
Bottom line:<br>
<p>
I'm pretty sure that this is what Cheryl was getting at when she<br>
talked about how perfection is viewed in the Bible - it's a complex<br>
subject, but (now my turn to quote verses out of context ;-) as<br>
James 3:2 says:<br>
<p>
	"For we all stumble in many ways.  If anyone does not stumble<br>
	 in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the<br>
	 whole body as well."<br>

Question:<br>
  Does anybody know if Adam and/or Eve ever sinned on a "lesser" scale before <br>
they ate from the forbidden fruit.  <br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
Let's see, sin is an inner state of being which is outwardly manifested as<br>
actions known as sins. Eve and Adam eating the forbidden fruit was an<br>
action which demonstrated their choice to distrust God's words to them<br>
and hence to disobey him.<br>
<p>
Why was Eve off near the tree in the first place? Could it be that she was<br>
already distrusting God's words? Perhaps the sin was creeping in to Adam<br>
and Eve's lives before they even left one another's side.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that the serpent could only have cultivated thoughts which<br>
were already present. This being the case, the eating of the fruit was the<br>
final display in Adam and Eve's small yet devastating display of independence<br>
from God. Whether or not any of their actions prior to this had indicated<br>
what was going on internally...well that was the question, wasn't it!<br>
<p>
This concept of being sinful without sinning...it has interesting implications<br>
in the "translation faith" discussion as well.<br>

Well it was close, but this is the 215th message this month to go out<br>
over SDAnet, breaking the old record of 214, set in April, '91 in the <br>
days of joint distribution.  <br>
<p>
Warren Trenchard of Canadian Union College has written to me,<br>
asking for E-mail addresses of religion teachers at SDA colleges<br>
and graduate students in religion.  I told him there were basically<br>
no people of that sort signed up to SDAnet.  But if anyone knows of some,<br>
send their addresses to me (if you think they wouldn't mind) and I<br>
will forward them to him.  This is evidently in connection with a<br>
scholarly association of Adventists whose acronyms I forget.<br>
