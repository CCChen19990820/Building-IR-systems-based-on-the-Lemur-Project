<i>&gt; "Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with</i><br>
<i>&gt; regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a SABBATH DAY."</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	- Col 2:16</i><br>
<p>
<p>
First of all look at the context :<br>
<p>
Col 2:14 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which <br>
         was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his <br>
         cross; (KJV) <br>
Col 2:15 And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them <br>
         openly, triumphing over them in it. (KJV) <br>
Col 2:16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of <br>
         an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: (KJV) <br>
Col 2:17 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. <br>
<p>
<p>
We see that this is the classic antinomian proof text. Now as to what the <br>
ordinances really refer to we have <br>
<p>
Heb 9:10 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal <br>
         ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation. (KJV) <br>
 <br>
Ie the ceremonial law.<br>
<p>
Having understood that and knowing that the Greek text says as the KJV more<br>
acurately translates it  "the sabbath days" and not The Sabbath DAY we can<br>
begin to understand what is really going on here.<br>
<p>
Obviously what we should not be judged on is the keeping of the ceremonial<br>
law. In fact the reference to Sabbath days refers specifically to the <br>
ceremonial sabbaths not THE Sabbath because these things were a shadow <br>
of things to come as Hebrews so clearly indicates.<br>

<i>&gt; Ruben says of Christ </i><br>
<i>&gt; "He had never been separated from His father, we often are."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree with this statement fully.  But it seems that when I posted</i><br>
<i>&gt; something similiar (and meant what is above) there were howls of protest</i><br>
<i>&gt; from Ruben and others.  Could it be that there is no difference between</i><br>
<i>&gt; my position and his after all?  (acknowledging that there are many positions</i><br>
<i>&gt; far to the left of me).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
diff is separation is a result of sin, not the cause of it.<br>

Sorry again for another long post but this will serve to sort out<br>
what sin is and what it isn't for those who seem to be confused by<br>
many of the definitions floating around today.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
			WHAT IS SIN?<br>
			     by<br>
			Dennis Priebe<br>
<p>
Righteousness by faith is probably the most important of all<br>
subjects in Christianity. But what do we really mean when we talk<br>
about the gospel? What is righteousness by faith? We have had much<br>
controversy within the Seventh-day Adventist church over these<br>
questions. It is highly significant that in serious debate of these<br>
issues we are driven back to one subject which seems to lie at the<br>
foundation of all discussions. Decisions which are made about<br>
righteousness by faith usually stem from previous decisions which<br>
have been made about sin.<br>
<p>
What is sin? Why are we concerned about a subject which seems<br>
so negative? Simply because one's conclusions about righteousness<br>
by faith depend on the definition one gives for sin. Why is man<br>
guilty? For what reason does God condemn a man? Why does God say<br>
that man must die in the fires of hell? What we decide about sin<br>
will affect every other decision we make about the nature of right-<br>
eousness by faith.<br>
<p>
Perhaps we have all assumed that we know what sin is. I believe<br>
that we need to take another look at our assumptions and decide for<br>
ourselves what we really mean when we use the word sin. We all know<br>
that we have sinned, but exactly how? When we go to a doctor, the<br>
doctor must ascertain what is wrong before he can give a proper<br>
prescription. Just so, we must know exactly what is wrong with our<br>
lives before Jesus Christ can save us from that affliction. We must<br>
know the nature of the disease to which the remedy will be applied.<br>
<p>
So let us go back and look at the sin that began all of the<br>
trouble that we've had in this world. We know that Adam chose sin<br>
voluntarily. We know that he became guilty because of his choice.<br>
But what about us? Are we guilty because of Adam's sin, because we<br>
were born as descendants of Adam? Are we guilty because we have<br>
inherited a fallen nature from him? Or Are we guilty because we<br>
choose to repeat Adam's sin?<br>
<p>
Thus we're back to the question of the nature of sin once again.<br>
What must the gospel forgive and heal? The basic question which must<br>
be resolved is this--What is the nature of sin for which a person is<br>
considered guilty, so guilty that he will die in the flames of hell<br>
unless God forgives him? What is the nature of that sin?<br>
<p>
			SIN AS NATURE<br>
<p>
Now we must begin with precise definitions. Many definitions of<br>
sin have been put forward within the past centuries.<br>
One group says that our guilt is the inevitable result of some-<br>
thing called original sin; Now, original sin does not mean Adam's<br>
choice to sin. It means the state in which we are born because of<br>
Adam's sin. As a result of Adam's sin, we Are born sinners. Now the<br>
term original sin has been used by many theologians, but perhaps we<br>
need to move away from terms as such and talk about the issues which<br>
are behind the terms. Sometimes theological terms tend to obscure,<br>
rather than to clarify. What does the term really mean? What do we<br>
intend to say by the term?<br>
<p>
Original sin can be defined in several ways. Some say that we<br>
are guilty because we have inherited sin from Adam. Some say we are<br>
guilty, not because we inherit guilt, but because we are born as sons<br>
and daughters of Adam, and thus we are imputed as guilty because of<br>
our birth into a fallen race. Thus Adam's guilt is imputed to us.<br>
<p>
Another variation says that we are not guilty either because of<br>
inheriting sin or because of being imputed as guilty, but because we<br>
are born into a separated state. We are born estranged from God. We<br>
are born apart from God, and that separation is our guilt. It is that<br>
estrangement for which we are guilty. Some even say that we are not<br>
personally guilty, but we are born condemned as part of a fallen race.<br>
<p>
But the one common denominator through all of these views is that<br>
we are guilty or condemned because of being born into a fallen race.<br>
We are guilty or condemned because we are part of the human family.<br>
So whatever term we use, however we explain it, what we are saying is<br>
that guilt or condemnation is by nature. Our fallen nature is our<br>
guilt. And it is really saying that we have two kinds of sin in our<br>
lives. We are guilty because of our birth as part of this race. We<br>
are also guilty because of our own sins, our own choices, our own acts<br>
of rebellion. Both aspects are sin. But you see, that means that we<br>
are first guilty or condemned before God because of the sin of Adam.<br>
Even if it would be theoretically possible for us to live our entire<br>
lives without performing a single sinful act, we would still be guilty<br>
before God because of our birth into a fallen human race. So although<br>
there are two aspects to sin, namely, our birth into a fallen race and<br>
our rebellious choices, we are already condemned because of our birth,<br>
before our choices. This is the bottom line of the term original sin.<br>
We are guilty or condemned as we are born because of Adam's sin.<br>
<p>
The implications of this belief are expressed in the following<br>
statements. "Sin is declared to exist in the being prior to our own<br>
consciousness of it." "There is guilt in evil desires, even when re-<br>
sisted by the will." "Sin is our inherited evil nature and all its<br>
fruits."<br>
<p>
So you see, in this definition, sin is before choice or even be-<br>
fore knowledge. Sin is before we can understand and make decisions<br>
about right and wrong. Sin resides within us because of our birth<br>
into a fallen race. John Calvin, one of the greatest of systematic<br>
theologians, had this to say about sin and guilt. "All of us . . .<br>
come into the world tainted with the contagion of sin. . . . We are<br>
in God's sight defiled and polluted. . . . The impurity of parents is<br>
transmitted to their children. . . . All are Originally depraved. . .<br>
Guilt is from nature." (emphasis supplied) He says that the hereditary<br>
corruption and depravity of our nature is designated sin by Paul. "Even<br>
infants bringing their condemnation with them from their mother's womb<br>
suffer . . . for their own defect." And of course this is sinful in<br>
the sight of God, for God does not condemn without guilt. "The whole<br>
man . . . is so deluged . . . that no part remains exempt from sin, and,<br>
therefore, everything which proceeds from him is imputed as sin. . . .<br>
Men are born vicious. . . . We are all sinners by nature." (John Calvin,<br>
Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book II, ch. 1, #5,6,7,8,9,10,27,<br>
emphasis supplied)<br>
<p>
You see, this understanding of sin clarifies why the Roman Catholic<br>
Church, Martin Luther, and John Calvin all held to the necessity of<br>
infant baptism. If, in fact, one is guilty by nature, it is extremely<br>
important that one be baptized immediately upon birth to wash this sin<br>
away, to be cleansed from this guilt of birth. Infant baptism is ex-<br>
tremely important as a remedy for the problem of original sin. And<br>
so Martin Luther and John Calvin argued strenuously for its necessity.<br>
Upon birth, children must be forgiven immediately, and cleansed from<br>
the sin which is inherent within them. Both Calvin and Luther were<br>
in agreement with and received their understanding of original sin from<br>
Augustine.<br>
<p>
Luther and Calvin also held the doctrine of predestination, which<br>
they also received from Augustine. Augustine believed that God predes-<br>
tines all men to be saved or lost. Martin Luther and John Calvin<br>
followed in this direction, and they built their doctrine of righteous-<br>
ness by faith upon the doctrine of predestination. Original sin fits<br>
in very logically with the doctrine of predestination. There is another<br>
dimension to the belief that sin is by nature. When Adam sinned, he<br>
lost the ability not to sin, so that all that was left for Adam was<br>
the ability to sin. Whatever decisions Adam made were sinful decisions.<br>
They could be decisions made between two relatively innocuous things,<br>
but they were decisions arising out of a sinful state, therefore, they<br>
were sinful. Thus Adam, after his sin, was only able to sin, and we<br>
as members of the fallen human race are also only able to sin. In fact,<br>
the only thing we can do is sin, and God can only forgive us of our<br>
sin.<br>
<p>
What I am saying is that this doctrine has many different ways of<br>
expression by different leaders and thinkers. But the one thing basic<br>
to all these definitions is that we are born sinners. We are born<br>
guilty or condemned, and because of our birth we suffer all the penal-<br>
ties that attach to sin. We are guilty or condemned because of being<br>
part of the family of Adam.<br>
<p>
It might be well to note in passing the reaction of Emil Brunner<br>
to this doctrine. "Thus the ecclesiastical doctrine, which is based<br>
entirely upon the idea of the fall of Adam, and the transference of<br>
his sin to the succeeding generations, is following a method which is<br>
in no sense Biblical. Even that passage, Rom. 5:12ff., which seems<br>
to be an exception, and has been regarded as the locus classicus of<br>
Christian theology from the time of Augustine, cannot be regarded as<br>
supportinq this Augustinian view, which was followed by succeeding<br>
generations. For here Paul is not trying to explain what sin is;<br>
indeed, there is really nothing in Rom. 5 which describes the nature<br>
of sin." "The theory of original sin which has been the standard one<br>
for the Christian doctrine of man, from the time of St. Augustine,<br>
is completely foreign to the thought of the Bible." "Sin is first of<br>
all to be understood as an act, namely as a 'fall', as an active break<br>
with the divine beginning, as an active departure from the divine<br>
order. . . . Sin is an act--that is the first thing to say about sin.<br>
Only as a second point can we say: this act is always, at the same<br>
time, a state, an existence in action, a state in which one cannot do<br>
otherwise, a state of slavery." (Emil Brunner, The Christian Doctrine<br>
of Creation and Redemption, pp. 9~,103,109)<br>
<p>
I would like to suggest that the evidence supporting the doctrine<br>
of original sin, in whatever way it is explained, whether by inherit-<br>
ance, or by imputation, or by separation, is not as clear and decisive<br>
in the Biblical record as some have thought it to be. There is at<br>
least another way of understanding the texts That are used in support<br>
of original sin.<br>

The article I posted from Denis Priebe was written during the mid to early<br>
eighties, much water has flowed under the bridge since then.<br>
<p>
Also thanks for the info On D.Priebe's current standing, I have not heard<br>
anything regarding him since the mid eighties.<br>
<p>
Sorry for not combining all my posts into one, they would be tooooooo long !:^)<br>

<i>&gt; Ruben says of Christ </i><br>
<i>&gt; "He had never been separated from His father, we often are."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree with this statement fully.  But it seems that when I posted</i><br>
<i>&gt; something similiar (and meant what is above) there were howls of protest</i><br>
<i>&gt; from Ruben and others.  Could it be that there is no difference between</i><br>
<i>&gt; my position and his after all?  (acknowledging that there are many positions</i><br>
<i>&gt; far to the left of me).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Steve</i><br>
<p>
Howls of protest would depend on if you saw the lack of separation, or <br>
separations being an automatic consequence of being born. Note that I did<br>
not mention any cause of the separation. Generally when many speak of this<br>
separation they do so in a Reformation/Calvinistic/Augustinian sense implying<br>
an inheretance due to begin born subject to Adam's sin. To which I would<br>
"howl" not true !........"Your sins have separated you from God"<br>
<p>
As to whether our positions would agree, I don't know what your fundamental<br>
assumptions are so I can't comment. If you want to know my position have a <br>
little look at Denis Priebe's next article on sin. That defines my position<br>
quite acurately.<br>

Looks like you have discovered something There! &lt;&lt;Grin!&gt;&gt; I have perceived <br>
your observation before that after a while Ruben begins to agree!<br>
<p>
<p>
When I attended Forest Lake Academy in Fla I knew a Reuben Lopez. I think <br>
he spelled his name differently then the one here on the net!  This evening <br>
I was thinking, "could it be the same person?" I hope not! Do you know if <br>
the SDA net Ruben ever lived in the states?<br>

Steve starts with some interesting citations, considering the argument<br>
he states at the end.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Romans 3:23  All have sinned and come short of the glory of God</i><br>
<i>&gt; Isaiah 4:6   For all of us have become like one who is unclean, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;              all our righteous deeds are like a leaf.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Romans 2:10  There is none righteous, not even one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And from a unknown place in Psalms [try Ps. 51:5--db]:</i><br>
<i>&gt;              Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did</i><br>
<i>&gt;              my mother conceive me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If indeed people are born not predisposed to good or evil as Ruben asserts,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then is it possible for some other human being to live a totally sinless</i><br>
<i>&gt; life *from birth*, never having to repent of any sin whatsoever?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If no, explain what enabled Christ to do so.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If yes, why hasn't it happened?</i><br>
<p>
The answer is, yes.  It hasn't happened yet because the conclusion<br>
is based upon a false premiss.  People are born predisposed to evil.<br>
Praise God that Jesus came to save sinners.<br>

				SIN AS CHOICE<br>
<p>
Now, I would like to focus on the second definition of sin, namely,<br>
sin as choice. In this definition, we are saying many of the same<br>
things that have been stated in the various definitions of original sin.<br>
<p>
We believe that in Adam's original nature, there was nothing that<br>
led him to rebel against God. There were no desires which led him away<br>
from God's will. For Adam it was natural to do right, and it was very<br>
unnatural to do wrong. But with the fall, something changed in Adam's<br>
very nature, in the innermost part of his being. The fall brought to<br>
Adam a bent to evil. His nature was now distorted and twisted, and<br>
Adam now wanted to do what he had hated to do before, namely, to rebel<br>
against God. Now, for Adam, it was natural to sin. Now, it was un-<br>
natural to do right.<br>
<p>
So when we say that we inherit a fallen nature from Adam we must<br>
understand that in its full rigor. We do inherit badness, weakness, and<br>
corruption from Adam. We have the same desires that Adam, in his sinful<br>
state, had. We desire to do wrong; we desire to rebel against God. It<br>
is hard for us to do right. It is more natural to do wrong. I think if<br>
we're honest with ourselves, we will admit that we are our own tempters<br>
all too often. We really do not need Satan to follow us around and<br>
tempt us with all sorts of ideas, because we tempt ourselves quite well.<br>
Our own natures lead us astray. Selfishness seems to be at the very<br>
root of our lives and it makes us do things we know we shouldn't do, but<br>
are sometimes driven to do. So we do inherit very negative tendencies<br>
from Adam, which lead us to do wrong.<br>
<p>
The one difference in this definition from the previous definition<br>
of sin is that we do not inherit guilt or condemnation. We do inherit<br>
everything that Adam could pass on. We inherit all of the leanings, all<br>
of the tendencies. all of the desires, and we are born in a way that God<br>
did not really intend for man to be born. But this definition says<br>
that sin comes through choice; sin does not come through nature. Guilt<br>
is not by nature, but when we choose, then we become guilty. We must<br>
choose to make Adam's decision, the decision to rebel against God, and<br>
then we are guilty.<br>
<p>
We must admit that sinful nature leads very naturally to sinful<br>
choices, and that the nature with which we are born starts us down a<br>
road that will lead to sinful choices. But the point that I would like<br>
to stress is that we are guilty when we make those choices, not before<br>
we make those choices. Therefore, I believe that we must careful~<br>
distinguish between the concepts of evil and guilt.<br>
<p>
These are the two basic definitions of sin. Depending upon which<br>
definition you choose to believe, all of the issues of righteousness by<br>
faith will be colored differently. The decisions you make about justi-<br>
fication and sanctification will be different depending upon the decision<br>
you make about the nature of sin.<br>
<p>
				EVIL AND GUILT<br>
<p>
If we want to define sin as choice, we must make a distinction<br>
between evil and guilt. There is much evil in the world today. There<br>
is evil even in inanimate objects. There is evil in the animal world.<br>
But we don't impute guilt to all of the evil that is apparent in our<br>
world today.<br>
<p>
One of my favorite illustrations is that of the common household<br>
pet, the cat. We enjoy cats who snuggle up on our laps or on our feet,<br>
who like to be petted, who come for their dish of warm milk. But some-<br>
times we forget that there is another side to this animal that we love<br>
to include in our homes. That side of this animal is a bit more vicious.<br>
Have you noticed that a cat is not too merciful with a mouse that he<br>
chooses to make his next meal? When he is able to catch a mouse, he<br>
does not quickly put it out of its misery, but he plays with the mouse.<br>
He, in fact, tortures that mouse, until the mouse finds it physically<br>
impossible to run away and finally gives up. What would we do to a<br>
human being who would torture an animal or a human being in that same<br>
way? We would consider him guilty of the most heinous of crimes, and<br>
probably lock him up for the rest of his life. But what do we do with<br>
the animal who has done that--with our cat? We say that it is part of<br>
the way life is. It is not good that the mouse suffers, but the cat is<br>
not guilty, either. Thus we see some acts as evil but part of the<br>
natural results of sin, and we see some acts for which a person is<br>
guilty.<br>
<p>
Now, to bring this to the human level. If we are pounding a nail,<br>
and we ask a friend to hold that nail, so that we'll be better able to<br>
drive it, we might miss the nail, and hit our friend's thumb. That<br>
thumb of our friend will hurt and be discolored, and will take some time<br>
to heal, but he will probably not accuse us of any personal guilt. He<br>
will treat it as an unfortunate accident.<br>
<p>
Let us take it even one step farther to make the point. If an<br>
infant finds a gun, and, playing with it, shoots his older brother or<br>
sister, we would take that gun away from the infant and simply make<br>
sure that we locked up our firearms better than before. We would<br>
not condemn or judge that individual as guilty. But if a 20-year-old<br>
person takes that same gun and shoots someone else, we would ask the<br>
question, Why? We would want to know if he is guilty of malice.<br>
<p>
So there is a difference between the concepts of evil and guilt.<br>
The word evil simply means that which is bad, negative, or wrong,<br>
the results of sin in a cursed world. Guilt applies to moral respon-<br>
sibility for evil thoughts or acts.<br>
<p>
What I'm saying is that trees and animals are full of sin and<br>
evil, but they are not condemned nor are they redeemed by God, for<br>
they have no knowledge of moral values. Only man has a knowledge of<br>
moral values, and because of this knowledge he is condemned as guilty.<br>
If we are to believe that sin is by choice, we must make a crucial<br>
distinction between evil and guilt. Guilt demands prior knowledge and<br>
willful rebellion. I am suggesting that God's condemnation is always<br>
based upon prior knowledge.<br>
<p>
			RESULT AND PENALTY<br>
<p>
Now we must try to substantiate the hypothesis that there is a<br>
difference between the concepts of evil and guilt. In Gen. 2:17<br>
there is a distinct and clear penalty given for rebelling against God.<br>
Adam was told by God, "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and<br>
evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest<br>
thereof thou shalt surely die." We've been puzzled about that verse,<br>
because it is just as clear that when Adam did eat of the fruit which<br>
Eve gave to him, he didn't die that day. So we have sometimes said,<br>
Well, he began to die. But the Hebrew simply says, "In the day that<br>
thou eatest thereof, dying, thou shalt die." The translation, "In<br>
the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die," is a good<br>
one. Then why didn't Adam die that day? "Why was not the death<br>
penalty at once enforced in his case? Because a ransom was found.<br>
God's only begotten Son volunteered to take the sin of man upon himself~<br>
and to make an atonement for the fallen race." (1 BC 1082) "The instant<br>
man accepted the temptations of Satan, and did the very things God had<br>
said he should not do, Christ, the Son of God, stood between the living<br>
and the dead, saying, 'Let the punishment fall on me. I will stand in<br>
man's place. He shall have another chance."' (1 BC 1085) "As soon as<br>
there was sin, there was a Savior. . . . As soon as Adam sinned, the<br>
Son of God presented Himself as surety for the human race, with just<br>
as much power to avert the doom pronounced upon the guilty as when He<br>
died upon the cross of Calvary." (1 BC 1084)<br>
<p>
Why didn't Adam die that day? Because the substitute was placed<br>
between the penalty of death and Adam that day. Jesus Christ took<br>
Adam's place that very day. Perhaps this helps us to understand Rev.<br>
13:8, where the Lamb is said to be slain from the foundation of the<br>
world. He actually did pay the penalty and stepped between Adam and<br>
the death penalty on that day. Very soon Adam offered the first<br>
sacrifice which he understood to mean that the Son of God would die<br>
in his place. Thus the penalty for Adam's sin was paid immediately by<br>
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ took Adam's place immediately. Then will<br>
Adam ever pay that penalty? Will Adam ever die to pay for his sin?<br>
They why did Adam die 930 years later? Did he ever pay the penalty?<br>
Or did he die simply as the result of sin? In fact, we're told that<br>
his death was a blessing, because he had endured so much agony knowing<br>
that his sin had caused all of the sin and pain and suffering that<br>
he had witnessed for 900 years. Thus his death was actually a relief.<br>
This death, the natural death that Adam died, was the result of sins<br>
rather than the penalty of sin. The penalty had been paid by Jesus<br>
Christ. Adam had offered the lamb showing that he understood that<br>
the death penalty had been paid. But the curse remained.<br>
<p>
This means that we must divide the<br>
basic idea of sin into two separate columns.<br>
The column on the left-hand side is labelled<br>
"EVIL," which includes all the things which		SIN<br>
result from sin, and all of this evil leads		/ \<br>
to death. But it leads to the death which	       /   \<br>
Jesus called a sleep, which is not a final	      /     \<br>
end for man. All of the evil and its re-	     /       \<br>
sults lead to death and suffering and all         EVIL      GUILT<br>
of the negative things we see around us.	   |          |<br>
<i>						   |          |</i><br>
But there is another column on the		  \|/        \|/<br>
right-hand side. This one is labelled		 DEATH       HELL<br>
"GUILT." And this column leads to the		(Result)    (Penalty)	<br>
second death, namely hell, which is the<br>
penalty for sin. So we really have two<br>
consequences of sin, don't we? We have<br>
the curse. which is Placed upon this world<br>
and even upon animals and upon all nature, which leads to death, the<br>
first death. This is the result of sin. Then, on the other side, we<br>
have guilt which leads to the penalty for sin, the second death, which<br>
has been paid by Jesus Christ. If we choose to accept Jesus Christ's<br>
salvation, we will never die the second death.<br>
<p>
Now it is true that the atonement covers both of these consequences<br>
of sin, but I would suggest that the atonement must deal with guilt by<br>
forgiving it. The atonement must recreate in the area of the curse and<br>
the first death. It must restore all things to God's original plan, but<br>
it doesn't forgive on that side. It only forgives on the side of guilt.<br>
It can only forgive the penalty. Thus the terms justification and for-<br>
giveness and salvation and the gospel and righteousness and sanctifica-<br>
tion apply particularly to those issues in the right-hand column, those<br>
issues having to do with guilt and penalty and hell. What I'm suggest-<br>
ing is that there is a basic difference between the result of sin and<br>
the penalty of sin. There is a basic difference between the first death<br>
and the second death, and the issues of condemnation and salvation per-<br>
tain to guilt and its penalty particularly. It is these areas that we must<br>
focus on when we speak about righteousness by faith.<br>
<p>
Now, let's look at some texts in the New Testament to see if we<br>
have further evidence of this distinction. In Luke 13:1-5, a story is<br>
told by Jesus to drive home a lesson. Luke says that there were some<br>
present that told him of the Galilieans whose blood had been mingled<br>
with their sacrifices. In other words, they had been killed. "And<br>
Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galileans were<br>
sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered such things?<br>
I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.<br>
Or those 18, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think<br>
ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?<br>
tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."<br>
Here we see that their death was not the direct result of their sin.<br>
Jesus was saying that these Galileans and the ones upon whom the tower<br>
fell were not proved to be more guilty than others because of their<br>
death. Here it ts clear that the first death that they died was not<br>
tied directly to their guilt.<br>
<p>
In John 9:1-3, the disciples saw a blind man, and they asked<br>
Christ, "Who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?<br>
Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but<br>
that the works of God should be made manifest in him." Once again<br>
Jesus was saying that his blindness, the curse with which he was af-<br>
flicted, was not the result of any personal sin, but was the result of<br>
an inheritance which he had received. Jesus is here making a distinction<br>
between personal guilt and the effects or results of sin.<br>
<p>
One text which is very important for us to consider is John 5:24,25.<br>
Unless we understand this distinction, we have Jesus contradicting Him-<br>
self in this passage. "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth<br>
my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and<br>
shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life."<br>
Jesus is saying that, right now, today, if we believe, we have ever-<br>
lasting life. Right now, we are passed from death to life. But He<br>
continues by saying, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming,<br>
and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and<br>
they that hear shall live." We just read in the previous verse that we<br>
are free from death, that we have everlasting life now. And then in<br>
verse 25 we read that we who are dead shall hear the voice of the Son<br>
of God. Unless we make this distinction between the first death and<br>
the second death, we find ourselves in a rather hopeless contradiction.<br>
Jesus is saying that we have eternal life today in Jesus Christ. We<br>
are freed from the penalty of guilt. We have been delivered and we<br>
will never die the second death. But we will die the death which is<br>
called a sleep in Lazarus' case. Later we will hear the voice of the<br>
Son of God and rise from that death. So even those who are forgiven<br>
and are given eternal life will still die the result of the curse of<br>
Adam's sin. We must die because we are in a world which is dying. The<br>
first death cannot be the penalty for sin, since those who possess<br>
eternal life actually die the first death. Eternal life means no second<br>
death, which is the penalty for sin. Another text which expresses this<br>
thought very clearly is I John 5:12,13, in which we are said to have life<br>
in Christ now, today, and yet we know that we will die.<br>
<p>
So I think that-we have good evidence scripturally that there are<br>
different consequences of sin. There is the curse of sin, which leads<br>
to the first death, and there is the penalty of sin, which leads to the<br>
second death. It is legitimate to say that there is a distinction<br>
scripturally between evil as a result of the sin which Adam brought<br>
into the world, and guilt, which has to do with man's personal decision<br>
about God.<br>

			LIGHT AND CHOICE<br>
<p>
Is it really true that guilt is the result of one's personal<br>
choice and not a result of our birth as children of Adam? Can we<br>
substantiate that from the Bible, that sin and guilt come from choice,<br>
not from nature? Let's look at some Biblical evidence to see what we<br>
can find.<br>
<p>
In Rom. 7:7-9, we have Paul speaking about the law, and our re-<br>
lationship to the law. Paul says, "I had not known sin, but by the<br>
law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt<br>
not covet. . . . For without the law sin was dead. For I was alive<br>
without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and<br>
I died." So we have Paul saying that we know what sin is because the<br>
law tells us, and if we did not know about the law we would really not<br>
have any knowledge or understanding of sin. He even goes so far as to<br>
say that without the law, sin is dead. Thus we sin when we know what<br>
God's will is. We sin when we understand and choose against God.<br>
<p>
In John 15:22,24 Jesus is speaking to His disciples, just before<br>
His death, and He says, IIIf I had not come and spoken unto them, they<br>
had not had sin: but now they have no Cloke for their sin. . . . If<br>
I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had<br>
not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my<br>
Father." Because of an understanding of who Jesus was and what He had<br>
done, they were responsible as they related to Jesus. Because of His<br>
coming, they were guilty if they rejected Him. Remember, thatls<br>
because of knowledge, because of awareness.<br>
<p>
In John 9:41, Jesus is responding to some of the criticisms of<br>
the Pharisees, and He says, IIIf ye were blind, ye should have no sin:<br>
but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth." If you were<br>
truly blind, if you really didn't know, you wouldn't be guilty of sin.<br>
But you say, we see, therefore you are guilty of sin.<br>
<p>
Doesn't it seem clear that<br>
sin and guilt are tied closely<br>
to knowledge and understanding		  /----- LIGHT-----\<br>
and light? Perhaps the differ-           /                  \<br>
between evil and guilt, is the        Evil    Knowledge    Guilt<br>
Biblical term, light. What               \                  /                 <br>
changes evil into guilt is light	  \-----CHOICE-----/<br>
or knowledge or understanding,<br>
and the choices made upon the<br>
basis of that understanding.<br>
<p>
<p>
In the book of James, some light is shed on this problem. In<br>
James 4:17, James says, "Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and<br>
doeth it not, to him it is sin." To the one who knows what is right,<br>
and who fails to do it. to that person it is sin. Once again knowledge<br>
and guilt are tied closely together. James 1:15 says, "Then when lust<br>
hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished,<br>
bringeth forth death." Here we see a development from lust, or desire,<br>
to actual sin. Sin is not within the desire itself, but sin is the<br>
conception of that desire. Sin is what is produced by that desire.<br>
Sin is the result of yielding to that desire.<br>
<p>
In the Old Testament, the book of Ezekiel has a word or two of<br>
counsel on this subject. Ezekiel 18:1-4 refers to a proverb used<br>
<p>
by the children of Israel. "What mean ye, that ye use this proverb<br>
oncerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour<br>
grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge? As I live, saith<br>
the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb<br>
in Israel. Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so<br>
also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die."<br>
Not because of the father's sin, but because of his own sin, as verse<br>
20 makes clear. "The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall<br>
not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the<br>
iniquity of the son." Individual responsibility for individual choices-<br>
individual freedom of choice.<br>
<p>
Now what does God do about those people who are doing wrong things<br>
ignorantly, who are out of harmony with the will of God? How does He<br>
handle that particular situation? Acts 17:30 expresses Paul's solution,<br>
I think. "And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now<br>
commandeth all men everywhere to repent." In the times of ignorance,<br>
men are doing evil things. They are doing things which are out of<br>
harmony with the will of God. They are breaking God's law and God's<br>
will. How does God handle that problem? What does He do about that?<br>
According to this verse, He "winks at," or overlooks the times of<br>
ignorance. He does not forgive, but He overlooks. But now, since we<br>
know, since light and knowledge have come, evil has become guilt for<br>
us. Now we must repent, and we must be forgiven.<br>
<p>
A strange statement by Jesus is made a little clearer with this<br>
understanding. In Matthew 11:21-24 Jesus is reproving the cities of<br>
Bethsaida and Capernaum. He says, "If the mighty works, which were<br>
done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented<br>
long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto you, It shall be more<br>
tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you."<br>
And then He continues about Capernaum. "If the mighty works, which have<br>
been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until<br>
this day. But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the<br>
land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee." Now in terms of<br>
quantity of evil works, I am sure that Sodom far outstripped Capernaum.<br>
But the condemnation was heavier upon Capernaum. You see, Sodom had<br>
done evil things, but many of those evil things had been done in<br>
ignorance. They did not understand God's way, and Lot was not a very<br>
good representative of the way of God for them. Because of their<br>
ignorance they were not as guilty as were the people of Capernaum who<br>
had rejected greater light. So Capernaum was more guilty than Sodom,<br>
on the basis that they had more light, and their choices were based on<br>
a more complete knowledge. In Psalm 87:4-6, it suggests that the Lord<br>
will take note of where a man is born. of where a man is brought up.<br>
He will make His judgments on the basis of where a man is, what back-<br>
ground he has had, how much understanding he has had of God's will.<br>
<p>
We need to note also some very important statements that Ellen<br>
White makes on the subject of sin and guilt. 'I It is inevitable that<br>
children should suffer from the consequences of parental wrongdoing,<br>
but they are not punished for the parents' guilt, except as they<br>
participate in their sins. . . . By inheritance and example the sons<br>
become partakers of the father's sin. Wrong tendencies, perverted<br>
appetites, and debased morals, as well as physical disease and de-<br>
generacy, are transmitted as a legacy from father to son, to the third<br>
and fourth generation." (PP 306) Please note what is transmitted as<br>
a result of Adam's sin. Wrong tendencies, perverted appetites, even<br>
debased morals, as well as physical disease and degeneracy. These are<br>
all part of what we receive from our parents and our ancestors. But<br>
please note the very important statement, children "are not punished<br>
for the parents' guilt, except as they participate in their sins."<br>
This is rather conclusive evidence for the doctrine that sin and guilt<br>
are by choice, not by nature or by what is inherited.<br>
<p>
"We shall not be held accountable for the light that has not<br>
reached our perception, but for that which we have resisted and refused.<br>
A man could not apprehend the truth which had never been presented to<br>
him, and therefore could not be condemned for light he had never had."<br>
(S BC 1145) She is saying that personal guilt is only on the basis of<br>
light and knowledge. We are not condemned because we do things which<br>
are evil or wrong unless we understand them to be wrong, unless we know<br>
that we are breaking God's law. "None will be condemned for not heeding<br>
light and knowledge that they have never had." (Ibid.) It seems clear<br>
that she is basing condemnation upon understanding, upon willful decisions.<br>
"Light makes manifest and reproves the errors that were concealed'in<br>
darkness; and as light comes, the life and character of men must change<br>
correspondingly, to be in harmony with it. Sins that were once sins of<br>
ignorance, because of the blindness of the mind, can no more be indulged<br>
in without incurring guilt." (GW 162) Once we know that our acts are<br>
wrong, we become guilty, because we keep on indulging in those sins.<br>
But before we knew, we were not guilty. After we understand, we are<br>
guilty. Guilt ties to choice and to knowledge.<br>
<p>
"There were still many among the Jews who were ignorant of the<br>
character and the work of Christ (after the time of Jesus, just before<br>
the destruction of Jerusalem). And the children had not enjoyed the<br>
opportunities or received the light which their parents had spurned.<br>
. . . The children were not condemned for the sins of the parents;<br>
but when with a knowledge of all the light given to their parents, the<br>
children rejected the additional light granted to themselves, they be-<br>
came partakers of the parents' sins, and filled up the measure of their<br>
iniquity." (GC 27,28) Because of personal involvement and personal<br>
understanding, guilt was imputed.<br>
<p>
"The sin of evil speaking begins with the cherishing of evil<br>
thoughts. . . . An impure thought tolerated, an unholy desire cherished,<br>
and the soul is contaminated, its integrity compromised." (Emphasis sup-<br>
plied) Please note the difference. It is the toleration of the impure<br>
thought, it is the cherishing of the unholy desire, which is sin and<br>
contamination. It is not the thought or the desire itself. It is not<br>
right to say that there is sin in the desire of sin if that desire is<br>
instantly repulsed. "Every unholy thought must be instantly repelled.<br>
. . . No man can be forced to transgress. His own consent must first<br>
be gained; the soul must purpose the sinful act before passion can<br>
dominate over reason or iniquity triumph over conscience." Consent is<br>
what makes iniquity. To purpose or to plan is to sin. "Temptation,<br>
however strong, is never an excuse for sin." (IT 177) The inclinations<br>
of the natural heart are not sin in themselves until they are cherished,<br>
until they are wanted, and then we are crossing the boundary between<br>
evil and guilt. The inclination is evil, but we are not guilty for<br>
that inclination until we choose to accept it.<br>
<p>
"'If light comes, and that light is set aside or rejected, then<br>
comes condemnation and the frown of God; but before the light comes,<br>
there is no sin, for there is no light for them to reject."' (1T 116)<br>
It seems very clear that sin is tied closely to knowledge and to under-<br>
standing.<br>
<p>
"There are thoughts and feelings suggested and aroused by Satan<br>
that annoy even the best of men; but if they are not cherished, if they<br>
are repulsed as hateful, the soul is not contaminated with guilt, and<br>
no other is defiled by their influence." (RH 3-27-1888) Those thoughts<br>
and feelings, if not cherished, will not contaminate with guilt. The<br>
thoughts and feelings are wrong. They are there because of the evil<br>
in the world, and because of a nature which we have that's fallen. But<br>
they are not contaminating, unless we choose to cherish them, or to hold<br>
on to them.<br>
<p>
In CH 81 Ellen White notes that using tobacco injures the body, but<br>
God is merciful to those who use it in ignorance. Only after light comes<br>
to them are they considered guilty for their use of tobacco. Now tobacco<br>
will have its negative effects. It may even lead to cancer, but until<br>
light comes, guilt is not imputed.<br>
<p>
In conclusion, I believe that guilt resides only within those higher<br>
faculties responsible for choosing evil, not in the lower faculties which<br>
suffer the effects of natural law, and are a part of the earth's cycle<br>
of sin. Guilt cannot reside in an amoral natural world but only in man<br>
who is responsible for law's perversions. Guilt does not attach itself<br>
to man's animal faculties, but to those moral faculties involved in<br>
exercising the power of choice.<br>
<p>
Sin, at its root, is self-love. Thus sin is determined by motive<br>
rather than acts. It is the choice to put self first, whatever form<br>
that takes. Sin is the choice to separate from God by putting self first.<br>
It is the choice to cherish evil. It ;s the choice to remain ignorant<br>
of God's will. It i5 the choice to be careless of one's abilities and<br>
responsibilities.<br>
<p>
At the foundation of the theological divisions among Adventists on<br>
the question of righteousness by faith lie differing beliefs on the<br>
nature of sin and guilt. The real debate is over the nature of sin.<br>
This question must be clearly answered: Why are we guilty and for what<br>
must we be forgiven?<br>

I noticed in Dennis Priebe's article he carefully omitted several texts<br>
which do not negate his position but raise a deep problem nevertheless<br>
Romans 3:23  "All have sinned and come short of the glory of God"<br>
Isa 4:6 "For all of us have become like one who is unclean, and <br>
all our righteous deeds are like a leaf"<br>
Rom 2:10 "There is none righteous, not even one"<br>
And from a unknown place in Psalms<br>
<p>
"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me."<br>
<p>
and other texts of the sort.<br>
I will grant that none of these texts actually claim we are born guilty,<br>
but the argument of being "born guilty" is not a common one among SDA's<br>
of any stripe.  The problem we face is not the theory of original sin,<br>
but the cold honest fact that everyone has sinned. (even the little<br>
babies?  I think so.) So I will ask the most pointed question I know how<br>
to ask<br>
<p>
If indeed people are born not predisposed to good or evil as Ruben asserts,<br>
then is it possible for some other human being to live a totally sinless<br>
life *from birth*, never having to repent of any sin whatsoever?<br>
<p>
If no, explain what enabled Christ to do so.<br>
If yes, why hasn't it happened?<br>

It seems that Dennis Priebe's article paints a dismally forensic view <br>
of evil and guilt, creating a false dichotomy between the two.<br>
<p>
Sin of any stripe leads to death, independent of God's intervention.<br>
(But see 1 John 5:16 for some sins that don't).  It is only through the <br>
grace of God that a world that is living in sin can even survive long<br>
enough to have the chance to repent.  Suppose people are smoking cigarettes.<br>
This is a sin whether they know it is right or not.  God does not have<br>
to reach out of the sky to zap them, they are killing themselves.  If<br>
they can't see what they are doing to their bodies, then the fear of<br>
hell fire won't make a difference either.  <br>
<p>
I do not say that people will necessarily be held accountable for sins<br>
of ignorance that are committed, that's God's problem, not mine.  The<br>
same goes for young children.  But God's laws in all sorts of situations<br>
have immediate consequences if broken.  The grace of God saves us from<br>
ultimate punishment, but it also saves us from enough of the immediate<br>
consequences so we can live long enough to make an informed decision<br>
about God, and it works to reform our characters so we can halt the<br>
cycle of self-destruction.<br>

Does the idea that certain people will have more stars in their crown <br>
than others come from any other  source than the gospel song <br>
"Will there be any stars in my crown?"  If so, where?<br>
<p>
The hymn is known outside the SDA church, so I'm wondering where the <br>
idea started.  Inquiring minds want to know.<br>
<p>
Now a joke:  Opening hymns at the three churches on Main Street:<br>
<p>
Methodist:  "Will There Be Any Stars In My Crown"<br>
Baptist:  "No, Not One"<br>
Presbyterian:  "Oh, That will be Glory For Me"<br>

[This is a hypothetical situation, but it's based on real life, see below  SCT]<br>
Suppose you are the president of a small SDA college in the Southern US.<br>
Finances are typically tight.  Suddenly one day you receive a call from <br>
the attorneys of a deceased church member.  This member, well-known to you,<br>
has offered to leave a sum of $100 million to your college if a few<br>
conditions are met.<br>
<p>
1)  All college faculty must sign an oath of allegiance to a long list<br>
of "historically correct" conservative SDA teachings, and abandon their<br>
membership in the Association of Adventist Forums.<br>
<p>
2)  All theology books by liberal SDA's and non-SDA's must be removed <br>
from the library.<br>
<p>
3)  Evolution is not to be mentioned even as theory in any science class.<br>
Further, you must hire Dr. Bob Gentry and fund his research.<br>
<p>
4)  No female students will be allowed to enter the theology program<br>
<p>
5)  Your college press must publish and promote his book, particularly<br>
it should be carried by all the Adventist Book Centers.  His book deals with <br>
the issues above and more.<br>
<p>
6)  Colin Standish of Hartland Institute should be hired as Vice<br>
President for Academic Administration<br>
<p>
If any of the six conditions are not met, the money will go to Hartland <br>
Institute instead.<br>
<p>
You contact your Board of Trustees and the General Conference leadership, <br>
they urge you to take the offer.  What do you do?<br>
<p>
[Note, the Church of Jesus Christ, Scientist  (Christian Science), is <br>
undergoing a similar situation as we speak, and they are careening<br>
towards schism because of it.  The lure of money from tax-exempt bonds<br>
led Jerry <br>
Falwell to declare his Liberty University a "non-religious school".  <br>
Let's not say it can't happen here.  SCT]<br>

Regarding the statement "He had never been separated from His father, we<br>
often are."<br>
<p>
Yes, we all agree with that. The difference between positions lies in the<br>
fact that some would say that sin is separation from the father, and some<br>
would not.<br>
<p>
Regarding Priebe's article, in my view he used "rather than" a few too many<br>
times. There aren't as many "mutual exclusives" there as he claims. Even as<br>
far down the tree as character perfection, all can aim for it and see it as<br>
valuable, it's just that some label it as sinlessness and some don't.<br>

Hi,<br>
<p>
Others may have already answered this, but for myself, this verse<br>
becomes clearer when the complete context is dealt with, particularly<br>
the following verse:<br>
<p>
COL 2:16  Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect<br>
          of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:<br>
COL 2:17  Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.<br>
<p>
Compare this text to Leviticus 23 and you will see that the 7th day sabbath<br>
was not the only sabbath in the Hebrew system.  The various feasts were<br>
also to be observed much as the 7th day was to be observed.  The feasts <br>
were shadows of things to come (e.g., Passover foreshadowed Christ's<br>
sacrifice on Calvary).  The 7th day sabbath was not a shadow (pointing<br>
forward), but a memorial (pointing back to creation).  Therefore, a<br>
reasonable argument can be made that Paul is not including the 7th day<br>
sabbath in this text.<br>
<p>
Hope this helps,<br>
<p>

Soy Sauce comes in literally hundreds of versions. La Choy, and Kikkoman are<br>
in my opinion not real soy sauces.  La Choy is not brewed, and kikkoman is a<br>
poor brewing Job.  Soy sauce begins life as cooked soybeans.  These are inocculated<br>
with various molds, and allowed to sit and turn green or black.  After fermenting<br>
the beans are generaly crushed, and one or more other molds, and or bacteria<br>
cultures are added.  They then go through more fermentation steps, until<br>
the beans have ripened.  The the beans get ground, pressed and the resulting<br>
fluid has salt added to it and is bottled.  There are dark, light, soy sauces,<br>
mushroom, etc. etc.  My favorite mushroom sauce is Pearl River (a chinese brand)<br>
.  It is a DARK heavy soy sauce, that is primarily used in cooking.  It is a<br>
bit strong for just sprinkeling on food.  My favorite eating sauce is Pon Lai<br>
another chinese soy sauce.  Has a tart sort of taste.  We buy it in the 5 gallon<br>
pail, and refill used soy sauce bottles as needed.  We generaly use about a<br>
gallon or so per year.  I use it exclusively instead of salt. (Yes it has LOTS<br>
of salt), but I like the flavor.  You can go to any well stocked oriental market<br>
and find 20 or 30 varieties of sauce, each of which has a diffrent flavor, <br>
"texture" and usage.  If I ever ran a chinese/oriental restaurant, I think<br>
I would have a "soy sauce bar" available for the clients.<br>
<p>
The process of fermentation breaks down the complex proteins and sugars, and<br>
releases bound nutrients.  Yeasts (alcohol producers) don't enter into the<br>
processing.   It is much more like pickling cucumbers etc.<br>

One of my interests is tracking down the sources of modern myths<br>
which pass around through the SDA church. Recently my daughter, Toni<br>
came home from a youth meeting with a story about a university study<br>
on plants and music. Very briefly the report said that when classical<br>
music was played the plants grew toward the source while when<br>
rock music was played they grew away from it.<br>
<p>
I heard the same story myself about 20 years ago. The story when<br>
told never sites the source of the reports. I must admit a fair<br>
degree of skepticism on my part about such stories.<br>
<p>
My questions are:<br>
<p>
Does anyone on the NET know the source of the report?<br>
<p>
Are there any corroborative studies in the same area?<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;Actually another good source of B12 is soy sauce.  Even though it may be</i><br>

<p>
There's fermentation, and there's fermentation.<br>
<p>
I have a friend who has quit eating soy sauce (and bread) because they are<br>
produced partly by fermentation.<br>
<p>
The problem is that she hasn't differentiated between not wanting to<br>
ingest alcohol (produced by fermentation) and using other fermentation<br>
processes to produce CO2 (to raise the bread), to produce soy sauce<br>
which, depending on the type, can have anywhere from none to tiny amounts<br>
of alcohol, or to produce acetic acid for various pickling processes.<br>
<p>
I haven't told her yet that sauerkraut, kim chee, or pickles all use<br>
fermentation to a greater or lesser degree in their production.<br>
<p>
But she read "something in Spirit of Prophecy" attacking fermentation...<br>
I don't think she's seen the quote that recommended restraint in one's<br>
intake of pickled foods (which used to be major part of people's diets<br>
before refrigeration showed up.  Pickled food at every meal is one thing,<br>
pickled veggies on occasion is something else entirely.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
I would like to propose that eating the fruit was the result of the sin.  I believe<br>
the sin was: not trusting and believing in God.  Yes, God said they were not to eat<br>
of the fruit, but the underlying test was were they going to believe God or self.  I<br>
believe that the sin was already committed moments before they ate the fruit, when<br>
they gave in to doubts and distrust.  The eating was the fulfilment or result of the<br>
decision.<br>
<p>
To me, sin takes place in the mind, not in the actions.  That is why it is possible<br>
to do right actions and still be sinning or doing something wrong because you have<br>
wrong motives.  Actions are the result of a decision you make.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Do we know for a fact that Adam did not keep on sinning?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is my understanding from my reading of Patriarchs and Prophets.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I just read in "The Story of Redemption" by EGW this morning in the chapter entitled<br>
"Cain &amp; Abel" (later part of the chapter) that Adam lived a life of "...continual<br>
repentence" after the fall.  Now this may not be conclusive proof that he sinned<br>
again and again but it begs the question why would he be continualy repenting<br>
(remember this meant sacrificing a lamb each time in those days) if he didn't have<br>
any sins to repent of?  To suggest that he was repenting over and over for the ONE<br>
sin in his life is to suggest that he really didn't believe God had forgiven him.<br>
<p>
I will have to look in P&amp;P for your suggested information.<br>

Steve,<br>
<p>
If I were that president,  I know that I would have to turn it down and<br>
let the Heartland Institute have the money.  Any kind of stipulation which<br>
would essentially discourage any "opposing" thought would not be the kind<br>
of institution I would allow to be under my control.  A college/university<br>
is supposed to be a place where alternate thought is not only expected,<br>
but encouraged.  The college experience is to be one where a person should<br>
be allowed to find the true being within oneself.<br>
<p>
I could never forgive myself for being a part of a plot to "eliminate" the<br>
"undesireable teachings" of an ultra-conservative.  I could not do it if<br>
the person were on the other side of the coin either.  A college must be<br>
able to encourage free thought I feel that this would seriously hamper<br>
that ability.<br>

As an SDA pastor I read with interest the questions rasied by Sherman Cox<br>
and Marcus Stringer.  I posed the problem yesterday to three of my "white"<br>
fellow pastors in the Detroit area.  Actually one of them is the pastor of<br>
the Korean church.<br>
<p>
We all recognize the same problems these men pose.  The Korean pastor had<br>
no input because of his ethnic church.  (I preaced there via the pastor's<br>
translating and had a great time, feeling little or no prejudice.)<br>
<p>
One pastor felt the church had some problems when he arrived and tried to<br>
make it clear that this kind of behaviour was beyond that of a Christian.<br>
The second pastor and I both have "black" families in our "white" churches<br>
that are very much involved in the church activities.  In the past one has<br>
been an elder and is not now because of his decision.  Another is currently<br>
a member of the church board and is very much appreciated for her contribution<br>
to tthe church (contribution = leadership contribution).<br>
<p>
I am very comfortable having a more international type church.  A broblem that<br>
concerns me is this:  How can I activly encourage "blacks" and others to join<br>
and feel welcome in my church and not raise the ire of the pastor of the "black"<br>
church in my community?  It would be the same question if I encouraged members<br>
of a smaller "white" church to join my church.<br>
<p>
I am not trying to hide behind this concern.  I would love to have churches<br>
with more ethnic groups represented.  How can I help bring this about?  I for one am a pastor that is willing to listen.<br>

I am not sure if I am sending this to the group or just to you, Steve, so<br>
edit if you please and send it on.<br>
<p>
As a member of the MI Conf. Executive Committee, I feel that the money<br>
definetly should be refused.  I may be a "conservitive" or a "liberal"<br>
but I feel a group, as in the church should be true to the convictions<br>
of the group.  Either side that begins to demand that the other follow<br>
the side with the money is going beyond what a Christian should do.  If<br>
God is with the group, the $100 million will make little difference in the<br>
success or failure of the group.<br>
<p>
A pastor recently remarked that he agreed with a recent editorial in the<br>
REview, we need to advertise.  Some of us agreed with a little comment:<br>
If we are doing something, people will know even without advertising, if<br>
we are doing nothing, the best advertising will do little good.  The same<br>
principle applies to the money.  If it comes with a price tag too high, or<br>
with any tag, it must be refused.<br>

I don't think Ruben asserted that people are not born predisposed to good<br>
or evil. If I read Priebe's words correctly then he says that we are all<br>
predisposed to evil, but that this predisposition does not equate to guilt<br>
on the part of the individual.<br>
<p>
It seems, according to Priebe at least, that the term "sinful nature" is<br>
a misnomer, and doesn't really make sense. He very much equates sin with<br>
the concept of guilt. So according to his definitions, Christ actually<br>
has an "evil nature". Predisposed towards evil, but not sinful because he<br>
has never chosen to commit a rebellious act.<br>

As for your question about whether someone other than<br>
Christ could live a sinless life -- I think this is<br>
speculation and it is better to stick to the Bibliccal<br>
evidence.  People might be interested to note that the<br>
Roman Catholics say that Mary never sinned, yet she still<br>
called Christ her Savior.<br>

Hi,<br>
somebody on the net asked where to find the <br>
text about stars on the crown.  Well, thanks to my<br>
mom I got the source (may not satisfy all my curiosity though).<br>
Try looking at Early writings by E.G.White <br>
I happened to be reading it from Korean Translations<br>
so I can't give you the page numbers, but it's the first<br>
chapter (First Vision I should say) pg 17 in Korean One.<br>
So it should be around there I guess. (hopefully someone will look up<br>
and post correct pg number).<br>
It says something like<br>
" Some were wearing very shiny crowns, some had stars on the crown<br>
and it looked heavy.  Some cronw had few stars.  but all seemed to be<br>
satisfied by what they had." <br>

<i>&gt;  &gt; "Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a SABBATH DAY."</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; 	- Col 2:16</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  First of all look at the context :</i><br>
...&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;  Ie the ceremonial law.</i><br>
...&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;  Obviously what we should not be judged on is the keeping of the ceremonial</i><br>
<i>&gt;  law. In fact the reference to Sabbath days refers specifically to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;  ceremonial sabbaths not THE Sabbath because these things were a shadow </i><br>
<i>&gt;  of things to come as Hebrews so clearly indicates.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that is one way to say it.  (From Lev. 23 you can find some/all? of<br>
those sabbaths).<br>
<p>
There is also another version and Bacciocchi Samuele (in the book Sabbath<br>
vs. Sunday, historical survey of sunday... (the name as twice translated)) <br>
says that this could refer to Sabbath or whole week and there is lots of <br>
stuff about non christian ways of celebrate Sabbath (in those centuries).  <br>
Bacciocchi also writes that there is not much commandments about _drinking_ <br>
and eating (times, ways, ...) in ceremonial law.  Colossians has also<br>
their "own theology" which must be taken in to account.<br>
<p>
The conclusion there were that Paul is referencing to the way of celebration<br>
more than the general purpose of Sabbath.<br>

Could it be possible that the reason the plants grew away from the rock<br>
music is because of the sheer volume at which rock music is typically<br>
played?<br>
<p>
Through my almost eighteen year walk with Christ, I have often heard<br>
many more mature Christians judge something they did not like as being<br>
ungodly.  After all, if they liked it, and they have the mind of Christ,<br>
then it must be good.  conversely, if they don't like something, then it<br>
must be of satanic origin.<br>
<p>
I have heard such things regarding Christian rock music.  If an elder<br>
Christian doesn't like it, then it must be of satanic origin.  <br>
<p>
Former President George Bush claimed to be a Christian.  He hated<br>
brocolli.  Therefore, I guess broccoli is of satanic origin.  <br>
<p>
Hope this helps to muddy the waters.<br>

Early on in my Christian walk, I was starting to get disturbed at some<br>
of the songs we used to sing in our fellowship groups.  "Lord of the<br>
Dance" was one such song.  There was a line in the song that said about<br>
Christ, "I am the Lord of the dance, said He."  Another song was "Come<br>
to the Water", where Christ is attributed as saying "And I strove to<br>
remind you, for those tears I died."  And all this time I thought it was<br>
for my sins that Christ died.<br>
<p>
These songs, like "Stars in my Crown", were written by humans.  They<br>
were not inspired of God in the sense that Scripture is.  But yet,<br>
because music is so powerful, and words to obscure sounds go over and<br>
over in our minds so easily, that oftentimes when we hear lyrics to<br>
songs, we figure they are teaching sound theology.  <br>
<p>
I have been in churches, Adventist and non-Adventist alike, where the<br>
hymns being sung either had very shallow theological content, or<br>
theology that was in error.  Yet they are sung, and people memorize<br>
them, and people are taught by them.  <br>
<p>
"Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish<br>
one another will all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns, and<br>
spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God."  Colossians 3:16.<br>
<p>
It has been the practice of the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North<br>
America to only sing the Psalms of Scripture in our worship.  That way,<br>
we don't have to worry about getting unsound theology through our<br>
singing.  I even got the SDA Church I attended some years back to try<br>
them out.  <br>
<p>
Although the above Scriptural quote speaks of "hymns and spiritual<br>
songs" in addition to psalms, this cannot possibly mean uninspired man<br>
written hymns that we sing in church.  First of all, the titles to the<br>
individual psalm include hymns and spiritual songs.  And by these hymns<br>
and spiritual songs, the word of Christ is to richly dwell in us.  This<br>
cannot happen with unispired human written hymns.  <br>
<p>
Something to think about.<br>

I've had trouble getting this from WP to elm, but I think I have succeeded,<br>
with help of several experts.  These are my thoughts...&gt; <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Several things can be said about Col 2:16:</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1.  The context of Col 2:16 deals with what God has done in Christ:</i><br>
<i>&gt; He has reconciled us, liberated us, united us with himself, made us</i><br>
<i>&gt; alive; he has disarmed the enemy and triumphed over him.  In view</i><br>
<i>&gt; of what Christ is and does for us, there is no need to look for</i><br>
<i>&gt; salvation in any other way, certainly not by self-abasement,</i><br>
<i>&gt; worship of angels, submission to rules and regulations about food</i><br>
<i>&gt; and days.  No, if our salvation has been accomplished, we have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; new nature.  We put away old enmities and practices; we put on </i><br>
<i>&gt; love and compassion.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2.  It is evident from the epistle that someone was teaching heresy</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the Colossian Christians.  They were being taught that salvation</i><br>
<i>&gt; was accomplished, not by Christ, but by human beings' DOING this or</i><br>
<i>&gt; that.  Whether the heresy was pagan or Jewish or a mixture of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; two, we do not know.  But it looks like someone was teaching a kind</i><br>
<i>&gt; of legalistic perfectionism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 3.  The nouns for "food" and "drink" would be better translated</i><br>
<i>&gt; "eating" and "drinking."  Paul says that the rules for partaking of</i><br>
<i>&gt; food, as taught by the heretical teachers, were not to be worried</i><br>
<i>&gt; about. Compare 2:20-22.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 4.  Paul's Christians at Colossae were not to worry about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; accusations of the heretical party about HOW they calculated or</i><br>
<i>&gt; kept the special days--whether yearly, monthly, or weekly.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; essence of Christianity is Christ; all else is but shadow.  Not</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the days were not important--Paul himself celebrated the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Jewish festivals--but Christ was so far above and beyond everything</i><br>
<i>&gt; else that the salvation he provided did not need to be "assisted"</i><br>
<i>&gt; by human observances.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 5.  SDAs have often said that in Col 2:16 we have yearly Sabbaths,</i><br>
<i>&gt; monthly Sabbaths, and again yearly Sabbaths.  Interestingly enough,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in all the other cases where the three kinds of days of rest</i><br>
<i>&gt; appear, we are perfectly happy to let them be yearly, monthly, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; weekly Sabbaths.  It would seem that somebody, somewhere in our</i><br>
<i>&gt; history, thought that the only way to protect the</i><br>
<i>&gt; seventh-day-Sabbath was to take it out of this text.  When one</i><br>
<i>&gt; takes into consideration the whole topic of the epistle, one can</i><br>
<i>&gt; leave the Sabbath in 2:16 and yet not have it destroyed: details of</i><br>
<i>&gt; religious observance, as mandated by the heretical teaching, do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; improve chances for salvation, since salvation comes only from</i><br>
<i>&gt; Jesus.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

Ray,<br>
<p>
I think sin has brought about MANY tears, would you agree?<br>
Should the truth be told, I'm sure the people of Haiti, Germany,<br>
and anywhere else under the Son, would agree.  We humans<br>
(through the help of the Church - IMHO) are so compartmentalized<br>
that we are raised to be oblivious to how acts and feelings are<br>
connected.  We don't give respect to the role of tears (assuming<br>
they're from pain or sorrow) in expressing how sin hurts people,<br>
and won't "allow" (though theological doctrines and TRADITIONS<br>
of the "Church") Christ to be interested in human feeling.  To me, the<br>
Desire of Ages paints quite a different picture.  So I'd differ with you<br>
on the sin vs. tears.<br>
<p>
As for deciding which songs are inspired and which are not,<br>
I think the decision should be made, understanding the context<br>
of the songs.  Some churches have hymn festivals, which might<br>
"debut" new hymns.  This helps believers get a fuller under-<br>
standing and appreciation for the song.  I personally enjoy old<br>
hymns, rearranging the music in classical and jazz styles, or<br>
interpretating them with greater levels of passion than the scores in<br>
which they were written.  Interesting note, the music to a number of<br>
traditional and famous Protestant "hymns" got their origins in the<br>
pubs of Europe.<br>
<p>
Undoubtedly, there are hymns/songs sung by other churches which<br>
would not make the "first cut" in your church's hymnal, and visa versa.<br>
Even with all the attention, and pickiness, we might still find things<br>
like that good old song "What a worm am I", which does seem to fit<br>
with MANY "Christian's" view of inspired theology.<br>

<i>&gt; A college/university is supposed to be a place where alternate thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not only expected, but encouraged.</i><br>
<p>
In it's broadest interpretation, this could be appropriately said for a<br>
secular institution.  It's typical humanist-type statement.  But I recommend<br>
caution in such an application to a Christian college/university.  Why?<br>
Because, like humanism, it leaves God out of the picture.  Two tho'ts:<br>
<p>
1) An example of such folly is the experience of D.M. Canright.  As a trained<br>
and well educated theologian, he persuaded himself that if simple folk<br>
such as James White, Hiram Edson, et al, could "come up" with a body of<br>
truth from studying Scripture, how much more could he (!), given his<br>
qualifications.  But he neglected to account for the humility of heart,<br>
the teachable spirit, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit that is requisite<br>
(Mat 11:29, Col 3:12, 1 Tim 6:11, Num 12:3, Ps 25:9, Is 61:1, Zeph 2:3,<br>
1 Cor 1:26, John 16:13).  In consequence, he made shipwreck of his faith.<br>
<p>
2) There are areas of human experience that God does *not* want us to<br>
have knowledge about .. those which are evil.  This was true before<br>
creation (Gen 2:17) as well as after (Rom 16:19, Phil 4:8).  Satan would<br>
have us arrogantly think otherwise (Gen 3:5).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The college experience is to be one where a person should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be allowed to find the true being within oneself.</i><br>
<p>
Echos from the 60s.  One cannot find oneself independent of Christ.<br>
He has a design and a purpose for each one of us (Ps 139:13-17).  Indeed,<br>
without Him, we could not be (e.g., 1 Sam 1:6,19,20; Acts 17:28); we are<br>
not the result of some random or chance event.<br>
<p>
p.s.  Perhaps I should cite the texts at length; for brevity, I haven't.<br>
Please look them up; Isa 55:11 promises a reward.<br>

For those interested, the source for Ruben's posts appears to be...<br>
<p>
Priebe, Dennis E., "Face-to-Face With the Real Gospel", Pacific Press, 1985.<br>
<p>
The paperback I have here is 90 pages long, four chapters, of which 41 pages<br>
have been posted to SDAnet.<br>

<i>&gt;The problem is that she hasn't differentiated between not wanting to</i><br>

<i>&gt;which, depending on the type, can have anywhere from none to tiny amounts</i><br>
<i>&gt;of alcohol, or to produce acetic acid for various pickling processes.</i><br>
<p>
Well, it is true that yeast produces alcohol, but when the bread is baked,<br>
the alcohol is driven off and only insignificant amounts remain, because<br>
ethyl alcohol is a volatile compound (bp 78 deg C). Besides, different<br>
fermentation processes use different microorganisms, with different<br>
products. In yoghurt for example, i don't think any alcohol is produced.<br>
The tiny amounts of alcohol in some fermented products are physiologically<br>
insignificant, because the liver easily detoxifys it (we were taught that<br>
alcohol is a metabolic substrate, ie food, but from what i see, it is<br>
treated more as a toxin than as a source of energy, by the body).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;before refrigeration showed up.  Pickled food at every meal is one thing,</i><br>
<i>&gt;pickled veggies on occasion is something else entirely.</i><br>
<p>
Well, i never heard about the SOP pronouncements on pickles, but i do know<br>
that there is definitely a link between a regular intake of certain types of<br>
pickled veggies and cancer of the oesophagus.<br>
	Actually, Ellen White wrote on a lot of things which are being<br>
scientifically substantiated, but there are still many areas where her<br>
writings do not agree with contemporary science, like what she says about<br>
the harmfulness of masturbation and about the cause of volcanos and<br>
earthquakes. But usually, science eventually comes to agree with her; like<br>
when she spoke of "cancerous germs" people didn't know of any germs that<br>
could cause cancer, however we now know that in animals, several viruses do<br>
so, and in humans, Hepatitis viruses definitely cause primary cancer of the<br>
liver, and there are several viruses that are associated with certain<br>
cancers.<br>
	While on the topic of health, i've noticed that SDAs stear clear of<br>
any foods or substances which have some unnatural effect on the body,<br>
believing that the body works best by itself and should not be interferred<br>
with unnecessarily, and that natural foods are best. However, the attitude<br>
of many other people is opposite to that, and they are always dosing<br>
themselves with all sorts of things hoping to improove the functioning of<br>
the body or to modify its functioning (eg coffee, tea, medicinal herbs,<br>
miracle foods and so on).<br>
	Another strange difference is that while we believe that humans were<br>
created by God, a lot of people (even Christians!) believe that we evolved<br>
from primates, and so there are whole branches of science investigating how<br>
well we resemble primates, and even fish. I was told that anthropologists<br>
study ape behaviour (more than they do human behaviour) to make theories<br>
about human behaviour, which seems to imply that they expect humans to<br>
behave like animals. While there are many similarities between higher<br>
animals and humans, i think they are taking it too far; even if we were<br>
evolved from apes, we are still too different to warrant applying ape<br>
studies to humans in the way in which they have been doing.<br>

<i>&gt; I will grant that none of these texts actually claim we are born guilty,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but the argument of being "born guilty" is not a common one among SDA's</i><br>
<i>&gt; of any stripe.  The problem we face is not the theory of original sin,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but the cold honest fact that everyone has sinned. (even the little</i><br>
<i>&gt; babies?  I think so.) So I will ask the most pointed question I know how</i><br>
<i>&gt; to ask</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Every one agrees that all have sinned, this does not really present any <br>
problems in Priebe's argument, that he didn't mention them is irrelevant,<br>
to the issue.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If indeed people are born not predisposed to good or evil as Ruben asserts,</i><br>
<p>
Now, Now here we go again.<br>

Ruben does NOT assert that people are born not predisposed to good or evil.<br>
<p>
This is the problem, why must people keep assuming that I assert things I don't<br>
I'll tell that if people would listen a bit more and not assume so much we <br>
wouldn't have so many difficulties in communication. (this of course<br>
does not include those who fully understand the imlpications yet choose to<br>
have funny ideas)<br>
<p>
Ruben fully asserts that people ARE born predisposed to evil. However the <br>
predisposition is NOT sin unless it is cherished! Show me one<br>
single verse in the bible that says that predisposition is sin, and I'll<br>
remind of of James when he says, that tempation does not bring death (GUILT)<br>
until the temptation conceives.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; then is it possible for some other human being to live a totally sinless</i><br>
<i>&gt; life *from birth*, never having to repent of any sin whatsoever?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
EGW makes it very clear that NO one can live a sinless life in their own<br>
power because they of themselves can not resist temptation. It is only in<br>
Christ that this can be done.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If no, explain what enabled Christ to do so.</i><br>
<p>
God's indwelling power, through the Spirit. The same power we can have, read<br>
Rom 8.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If yes, why hasn't it happened?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Because we enjoy sin too much. But Christ did it, we can live from now on<br>
without sin if we surrender so completely to God that it is no longer we<br>
who live but Christ who lives in us.<br>
<p>

<p>
Personally, i think there is such a thing as poetic liscence and much<br>
allegory and symbolism in poems and songs. Most people know this and don't<br>
take everything in songs as literal. Even in the bible psalms, there is much<br>
symbolism and poetic expression that i do not think is meant to be literal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Although the above Scriptural quote speaks of "hymns and spiritual</i><br>
<i>&gt;songs" in addition to psalms, this cannot possibly mean uninspired man</i><br>
<i>&gt;written hymns that we sing in church.  First of all, the titles to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;individual psalm include hymns and spiritual songs.  And by these hymns</i><br>
<i>&gt;and spiritual songs, the word of Christ is to richly dwell in us.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt;cannot happen with unispired human written hymns.  </i><br>
<p>
You seem to be implying that whatever is not in the cannon of the bible is<br>
uninspired. Why do you think this? God inspires many people in many<br>
different ways. The bible has its own function, but it is not the one and<br>
only way in which God communicates with humans. And the bible itself is<br>
written by humans too. How do you know that extrabiblical hymns are<br>
uninspired? The people in say, Enoch's time, must have then had a very<br>
limited repetoire of songs to sing.<br>

Michael, it's exciting to read your response.  Number one, the spirit of<br>
rivalry isn't a part of Christ, from the little I've read.  Racism, and <br>
barriers<br>
are not a part of Christ either - no matter who is infected - at least from<br>
what The Desire of Ages, and New Testament gospel writers say.<br>
"Cast is hateful to God.  He ignores everything of this character.  In His<br>
sight the souls of all men [women] are of equal value." [DA p403<br>
"Barriers Broken Down"]<br>
<p>
The greatest way I know of to have people attracted to a church, is to<br>
address THE PEOPLE'S needs.  Make an effort to know _their_ world<br>
from THEIR perspective.  You will never know it a clearly as they do,<br>
but the level of your effort, passion, and determination will be to<br>
significant factor.  The road isn't easy, and your efforts at times, won't<br>
be appreciated by any group.  You're not going to get it overnight<br>
either, so even before you attempt this, latch hold of Jesus.  Let His<br>
efforts, passion, and determination fill you - you're going to need it.<br>
<p>
Don't be silent.  Speak it from the pulpit, in your home, in your member's<br>
homes.  Express it, act it out in the church school, in the "secular" civic<br>
arena.  Don't put your trust in the arms and opinions of man, waiting for<br>
it to be "safe", or popular.  Some may get angry, but others in whom the<br>
Holy Spirit has been sowing seeds, will be encouraged and respond.<br>
<p>
I think that we are called to follow Christ's example and pursue greater<br>
feats in and through Him (not just in volume, but in scope, and tactic)<br>
than what He did while on earth.  He laid the groundwork, gave us<br>
examples, and now calls us to fulfil our "in His image" by being<br>
"merciful, gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth".<br>
We are to create, new variations on His theme of loving service and<br>
self-sacrifice.<br>
<p>
God bless!<br>

</ul>
<!-- body="start" -->
I have very carefully read the Dennis Priebe article posted by Ruben Gonzalez<br>
called "Will the Real Gospel Please Stand Up?" and I find it to be<br>
a terribly twisted and misleading attempt at replacing the wonderful Gospel of<br>
Christ's grace with a "new gospel" (under the guise of "historic Adventism")<br>
centered on salvation by human effort.  The article fails to present Christ<br>
and His Atonement as the solution to the mire of sin; rather, it challenges<br>
each of us to become our own "savior"  -- with a little help from above,<br>
of course.<br>
<p>
The author is obsessed with "Christian perfection," which he defines as<br>
"total victory over sin."  He concludes that it is possible for us to work out<br>
"a sinless character in a sinful nature."  I call this hogwash fringing on<br>
blasphemy.  While the quasi-gospel Priebe endorses pays lip service to Christ<br>
and to the Atonement,  what is really at its core is perfection by human<br>
effort.  Christian perfection is possible only through faith in Christ<br>
(Romans 4:3), who gives us the gift of His righteousness to replace the<br>
curse of our own filthy rags.  Salvation is all of Christ and none of us<br>
(Galatians 2:16).  Christ is "made unto us wisdom, and righteousness,<br>
and sanctification, and redemption" (1 Corinthians 1:30).  Our salvation<br>
is 100 percent wrapped up in Christ, and our good works, imperfect as they<br>
may be, flow out of our love and appreciation for our wonderful Savior.<br>
EGW says that the quilt of our salvation does not contain "a single thread<br>
of human devising."<br>
<p>
To those in Priebe's camp, Christ's ministry on earth serves as an example<br>
for us and little else.  If we only follow the example, we can ourselves<br>
accomplish all that Christ accomplished.  The Atonement's main function was<br>
to clear the way for us to work out our own salvation.  Christ's role as<br>
our one and only Savior, there being no other name under heaven which can<br>
save us, is barely mentioned.<br>
<p>
THE NATURE OF SIN<br>
Priebe asserts that predestination and the concept of original sin must<br>
go together.  Clearly he is begging the question.  Original sin has nothing<br>
to do with the Reformation misconcept of predestination.  ALL have sinned,<br>
the Bible says.  No one is excluded.  We are conceived (Ps. 51:5) with the<br>
sin of Adam upon us, to which we add our own sinning, thus making us sinners<br>
twice over.  Christ, as the Second Adam, removes the sin of our first parent<br>
from us, and makes provision to cleanse us of our own sins.  Our inherited<br>
sin is only part of the story, and the concept of inherited sin does not,<br>
as Priebe states, remove our responsibility.<br>
<p>
THE NATURE OF CHRIST<br>
Priebe suggests that to argue that Christ was born with the pre-Fall nature<br>
is to say that He had no connection at all with our sinful nature.  That is not<br>
so.  He was fully human and was encumbered with all post-Fall attributes,<br>
except in having man's post-Fall inclination toward evil.  Notice these<br>
striking EGW statements:<br>
<p>
"[Christ] is a brother in our infirmities, but not in possessing like<br>
passions.  As the sinless One, His nature recoiled from evil." (2T 202).<br>
<p>
"In his humanity, Christ was tried with as much greater temptation, with<br>
as much more persevering energy than man is tried by the evil one, as his<br>
nature was greater than man's." (RH 12/20/1892)<br>
<p>
"He [Christ] vanquished Satan in the same nature over which in Eden Satan<br>
obtained the victory." (5BC 1108)<br>
<p>
"Christ conquered as the sinless, unfallen, perfect Man." (UL 17)<br>
<p>
"Christ did not possess the same sinful, corrupt, fallen disloyalty we<br>
possess, for then He could not be a perfect offering."  (3SM 131)<br>
<p>
JUSTIFICATION<br>
Priebe claims that these views cause an unholy overemphasis on justification,<br>
to the exclusion of sanctification.  Yet 1 Corinthians 1:30 points to Christ<br>
as the only basis for the entirety of salvation -- justification, sanctifi-<br>
cation... you name it.  I remember reading an EGW statement where she clearly<br>
warns that we should not try to drive a wedge between justification and<br>
sanctification, for the two are virtually one and both are completely wrapped<br>
up in our Savior Jesus Christ.  If you want to generalize by saying that<br>
justification occurs at conversion and sanctification is a life-long process,<br>
that's okay -- but the mechanism is the same and the Savior is the Same.  It's<br>
all of Christ and none of us.  There is not a single thread of human devising<br>
in the quilt of our salvation.<br>
<p>
PERFECTION<br>
Priebe warns that people who, in his view, have the wrong gospel avoid any<br>
talk of perfection or sinlessness in this life.  He claims that they<br>
believe that "the very effort to attain perfection results in legalism and<br>
a denial of righteousness by faith."  Again, he is exaggerating his case<br>
and building on a false premise.  If a person's "effort" to attain perfection<br>
is centered in self, then that is obviously legalism; but if a person's<br>
"effort" to attain perfection is based on submitting to Christ's will and<br>
receiving as a grace gift His perfect righteousness, then that is the right<br>
kind of effort and the right kind of perfection.  It is actually not our<br>
"effort" at all.  It is our submission to the efforts of Christ on our behalf.<br>
And yes, even after receiving Christ into our hearts, we remain in our sinful<br>
nature until "this corruptible has put on incorruption" (1 Corin. 15:54) at<br>
the last trumpet. But despite this,  we aspire to the perfection of Christ --<br>
and by His grace we are saved.<br>
<p>
It IS possible to have a sinless character in a sinful nature: it is the<br>
sinless character of Christ imputed to us by grace through faith, thereby<br>
making it possible for us to be accounted righteous in the sight of God.<br>
There is no other name given under heaven whereby we might be saved.<br>
<p>
THE RESULTS<br>
Priebe asserts that persons who believe in what he feels is an incorrect<br>
gospel are bound to participate in the following: lowering church standards,<br>
no health reform, Sabbath not important, law not binding, reducing Ellen<br>
White's authority, no 1844 judgment, and no literal sanctuary.  I say this<br>
assertion is drivel; when righteousness by faith is seen in its true light,<br>
as being all of Christ and none of us, then our obedience and our<br>
adherence to light and truth is greatly enriched and enhanced.  We are serving<br>
God out of a true appreciation of His character and a true love for His ways.<br>
We are no longer rendering the sullen submission of a rebel, who, if he dared<br>
to, would break away in rebellion.  The fresh rainfall of heaven has fallen<br>
on the dry, dusty hills of Gilboa.  The truth has set us free...<br>

possible<br>

The act of chosing or consenting is also an act but takes place in the mind.<br>
The decision you make are action, acts of the will.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Cain &amp; Abel" (later part of the chapter) that Adam lived a life of</i><br>
 "...continual<br>
<i>&gt; repentence" after the fall.Now this may not be conclusive proof that he sinned</i><br>
<i>&gt; again and again but it begs the question why would he be continualy repenting</i><br>
<i>&gt; (remember this meant sacrificing a lamb each time in those days) if he didn't</i><br>
 have<br>
<i>&gt; any sins to repent of?  To suggest that he was repenting over and over for the ONE</i><br>
<i>&gt; sin in his life is to suggest that he really didn't believe God had forgiven him.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I will have to look in P&amp;P for your suggested information.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; --Bruce</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I would suggest that one can live a life of continual repentance after having <br>
comitted just one sin, repentance means much more than just saying, "I'm sorry"<br>
also being continually repentant has nothing to do with whether a sin has been<br>
forgiven or not. Further continual repentance does not imply constantly <br>
sacificing lambs.<br>
<p>
Repentance means a turning away from sin, abandoning sin, if he lived a life<br>
of continuingly turning away from sin then that would mean not doing any more<br>
sin.<br>

Isn't it interesting that many SDAs would prefer to sing an old hymn that<br>
may contain odd theology than a contemporary arrangement of a scripture<br>
song that is probably straight from the Bible??<br>

1. Yes, the jive about stars in the crown is definitely in Early Writings.<br>
   I found it a little disturbing, to be honest, to read some of the <br>
   descriptions of the commandment-keepers feeling that they had earned<br>
   the rights to the holy city, and also how they watched with some<br>
   degree of satisfaction as judgment was declared on the unworthy.<br>
   (At least that was the impression I was getting, maybe that wasn't<br>
   quite right).<br>
<p>
   It wasn't that I was "disagreeing" with E.G.White, or questioning<br>
   her inspiration, I was just reading Early Writings to check it out<br>
   and wasn't comfortable with that. I think I myself would feel<br>
   extremely grateful rather than extremely worthy to be walking into<br>
   the holy city!!<br>
<p>
<p>
2. About Adam's sin, eating the fruit and so on. There seems to be some<br>
   discussion over exactly when the "sin" occurred. When he doubted God,<br>
   or when he ate the fruit?<br>
<p>
   I think the discussion *may* be a bit academic, just from reading the<br>
   messages it seems to me that both sides agree. That is, once Adam<br>
   made the decision to disobey, he sinned. It's like basketball, "fouled<br>
   in the act of shooting". The act of eating the fruit commenced when<br>
   he decided to do it.<br>
<p>
   Just to make sure I've judged correctly... would you agree that if<br>
   Adam doubted God, then decided that doubting God was a bad idea and<br>
   didn't eat the fruit, that he didn't sin? If so, then you agree that<br>
   the act of eating the fruit coincided with the severance of his<br>
   relationship with God, and whichever way you define sin, there it is.<br>
<p>

Ok here is the promised info.<br>
<p>
The following is from an article entitled "Music to Kill Plants By."<br>
which appeared in the Columbus Dispatch Magazine, July 26, 1970, pp24-27.<br>
It was quoted in the book "The Big Beat" by Prof. Frank Garlock.<br>
<p>
"For nearly two years, Mrs. Dorothy Retallack of Denver [Ohio] has been killing <br>
off assorted potted plants by making them listen to rock music... and if the <br>
sound of rock does that to plants, Mrs. Retallack wonders what the same rock <br>
music is doing to todays teenagers ... Mrs. Retallack.. potted the plants in <br>
the same soil under identical conditions; the only variable was music and<br>
within a month all plants exposed to the rock music died."<br>
<p>
<p>
See, I know how to properly reference things :^)<br>
<p>
Ruben.<br>
<p>
PS. It is unfortunate that plants can't understand the inspiring lyrics.<br>

Well gang, I've looked up soy sauce in my handy dandy Pennington book<br>
on Food Values and there ain't any B-12 in soy sauce!  Regardless of<br>
whether the soy sauce is made with hydrolyzed vegetable protein, with<br>
soy and wheat (shoyu), or soy only (tamari), a quarter (1/4) cup has<br>
0.0 mcg of b-12.  So don't count on Chinese food making up your b-12<br>
requirement...<br>

Well, with 3 days and no SDAnet you probably thought your link to the<br>
outside world<br>
was down.  But I was just at Andrews for Alumni Weekend.  I could have logged<br>
on from there but chose not to.  As a result of a weekend's recruitment we will<br>
soon see several new members.<br>

Is this a booboo Steve ? <br>
[yes, indeed.  I repeat the apology to the whole net which I have<br>
already sent to Paul gates.  We are exploring technology changes so that<br>
this cannot happen  (like having my personal E-mail come to an entirely <br>
different node).)  But thanks, Ruben, for taking it in good spirits.  SCT]<br>

We wish!<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; When I attended Forest Lake Academy in Fla I knew a Reuben Lopez. I think </i><br>
<i>&gt; he spelled his name differently then the one here on the net!  This evening </i><br>
<i>&gt; I was thinking, "could it be the same person?" I hope not! Do you know if </i><br>
<i>&gt; the SDA net Ruben ever lived in the states?</i><br>
<p>
Which one :^)))).<br>
<p>
Hehe, There are lots of little Ruben clones running around the world, its <br>
a global conspiracy, yes we do all camoflage ourselves by changing the<br>
spelling a small amount, but in most cases it does the trick. Rats! Paul has<br>
discovered us, oh no. Beware, whenever you come across a Ruben clone, they are<br>
programmed to be subversive and will one day rule the world. <br>

Hello fellow netters,<br>
<p>
I'd like to respond with a few comments on "Stars in my Crown" and related<br>
issues.<br>
<p>
Thanks Andrew for the reference to Early Writings.  However, your reference<br>
brings up the question again asked earlier (I don't remember who):<br>
<p>
When reading EGW, where do we draw the line between symbolic visions and<br>
reality.  To repeat the earlier comment - EGW is travelling on a road "high<br>
above the earth" etc etc.  We all know that is symbolic.  However, in the<br>
same vision, as she crosses the chasm into heaven, we find "flowers that<br>
will never fade" and children "using their little wings" etc.<br>
<p>
Now I don't at all want to eat up somebody's faith in heaven - but why is<br>
the first part of the vision taken figuratively, and the second part<br>
literally?  I think we must be more careful in interpretation of inspired<br>
writings than we often are.<br>
<p>
Now - back to the crowns.  Maybe we won't have stars in our crowns - or for<br>
that matter, maybe we won't have crowns at all!  But does it really matter?<br>
Isn't the message of the EGW vision (and for that matter the song as well)<br>
that there is infinite satisfaction in knowing the Lord has seen fit to use<br>
(imperfect) me as an instrument in bringing someone else closer to Him?<br>
And then EGW goes further in bringing the message that in heaven there won't<br>
be jelousy as to who gets the most satisfaction!<br>
<p>
So what will heaven be like?  Do we say "if there is no marraige in heaven<br>
I don't want to go"?  A little girl (who I know) asked once "Will there be<br>
peanutbutter in heaven?"  To her, this was an all-important question - but<br>
to us somewhat trivial.  I think God smiles sometimes as he hears our<br>
"peanut butter" questions.<br>
<p>
In closing - another illustration:<br>
<p>
A father found his son crying.  "Why are you crying?"  -  "Because I don't<br>
want to get big."  -  "Why not?"  -  "Because then I won't be allowed to play<br>
with my toys anymore."<br>
<p>
The father explained that when he was big he wouldn't want to play with his<br>
toys anymore, and that it would no longer be an issue.  He then left the room<br>
happy that his son was comforted.  A little later he heard the boy crying <br>
again.  He returned and asked why he was crying again.  The boy answered<br>
"Because I don't want to 'not want' to play with my toys.  I want to 'want'<br>
to play with my toys forever."<br>
<p>
I often hear myself 'not wanting to not want to'.<br>
<p>
"Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has it entered into the heart of<br>
man ....."<br>
<p>
To quote another song "I want to be there - don't you?"<br>

[As far as the stars, I was well aware of the EGW quote that says we<br>
will have them.  I am wondering more about the urban legend that<br>
suggests each one is <br>
for a soul saved.  SCT]<br>

The real question is not whether there are stars in the crown.  Rather,<br>
will it have a watch embedded in it so it will be functional and not<br>
just "ornamentation".   :-)   Steve<br>

[The words "sinful nature", which are not Priebe's but Ellen Whites,<br>
are the core of this debate.  Every time I say, "no SDA believs..."  I <br>
find one that does.  Here's a classic "new theology" argument.  See if <br>
they ae defining the terms the same.  I can't tell.  SCT]<br>

<i>&gt; It seems, according to Priebe at least, that the term "sinful nature" is</i><br>

<i>&gt; has an "evil nature". Predisposed towards evil, but not sinful because he</i><br>
<i>&gt; has never chosen to commit a rebellious act.</i><br>
<p>
I find this a greatly troubling position to take.  In my view, this is a<br>
corner into which perfectionism paints itself:  that Christ had a sinful<br>
human nature, predisposed to evil as we are -- and that, through the help<br>
of some "power" from God, He was able to overcome sin and lead a perfect<br>
life.  Now, if He could do it, we are expected by God to GO AND DO<br>
LIKEWISE.  My question is: where is the Atonement in this view?  Why did<br>
Christ have to die?  Was He just our Example, or is He our Savior also?<br>
<p>
God told Adam and Eve that IN THE DAY that they ate of the<br>
tree of knowledge, they would die.  They were guilty.  They deserved to<br>
die ON THE SPOT, and THEIR SEED SHARES IN THE RESULTS OF THEIR GUILT.  That is<br>
biblical; that is supported by EGW.  It isn't just the predisposition to<br>
sin that was transmitted to future generations, it was the SIN itself --<br>
Adam and Eve's sin, which is passed down to us.  "The sin of Adam plunged<br>
the race in hopeless misery and despair" (4T 293).  <br>
<p>
The Bible says that ALL have sinned (Rom. 3:23); I don't see justification<br>
for excluding (1) persons before the age of accountability, or (2) persons<br>
before they knowingly and willingly commit their first sin.  Galatians 3:22<br>
underscores this fact: "...the scripture hath concluded ALL under sin, that<br>
the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe."<br>
<p>
"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity," David said, "and in sin did my mother<br>
conceive me" (Ps. 51:5).  David isn't talking about a predisposition to<br>
sin -- he's taking about SIN.<br>
<p>
As I see it, there are two different categories of sin that make men<br>
sinful:<br>
<p>
1) The ONE sin of Adam, which we inherit from conception (Romans 5:12-19;<br>
Ps. 51:5) and over which we have no choice.  This makes us sinful and<br>
worthy of death.  By Christ's perfect life and atoning death, this sin is<br>
removed from the slate of the believer, and he is no longer accounted a<br>
sinner in this respect.<br>
<p>
2) The SINS that are our own, committed in rebellion against God.  This<br>
is the class of sinning that James is referring to, not the class of<br>
sin that Paul refers to in Romans.  Even if we<br>
never reach the point of committing a category 2 sin, we are guilty by<br>
virtue of the category 1 sin of Adam.  Unless we are covered by Christ's<br>
blood, which legally removes us from the effects of category 1 sin: "The<br>
sin of Adam plunged the race in hopeless misery and despair.  But God, in<br>
His wonderful, pitying love, did not leave men to perish in their<br>
hopeless, fallen condition.  He gave His well-beloved Son for their<br>
salvation.  Christ entered the world, His divinity clothed in humanity; He<br>
passed over the ground where Adam fell; He bore the test which Adam failed<br>
to endure; He overcame every temptation of Satan, and thus redeemed Adam's<br>
disgraceful failure and fall (4T 293).<br>
<p>
Boom! The sin of Adam is wiped from our slate (Rom. 5:18, 19).<br>
<p>
We are forgiven and so Christ tells us to GO AND SIN NO MORE.  In other<br>
words, category 2 sins are still possible, and if they become habitual and<br>
if we don't repent and ask forgiveness, category 2 sins will lead us to<br>
lose our crown of life.<br>

[This article, as Kevin asks later, matches the details reported in Spectrum<br>
over the years and I have no reason to doubt its authenticity.  SCT]<br>
<p>
<p>
There's a front page article on the 04/21/93 Wall Street Journal entitled:<br>
Christian Groups Press Gay People to Take a Heterosexual Path; Pentecostal<br>
Ministries Claim Successes in Some Cases, But the Road is Difficult.<br>
<p>
In reading the article, I didn't notice any specific denominations mentioned<br>
until near the end in a section entitled "Trying and Failing." This portion of<br>
the article begins:<br>
<p>
In the early 1970's, Colin Cook, A Seventh-Day Adventist minister, resigned<br>
from the church when he could no longer harmonize his gay liaisons with his<br>
religious beliefs. Mr. Cook says he had sex with more than 1,000 men in a<br>
frenzied decade before he decided that his behavior was wrong and started<br>
Homosexuals Anonymous, a Christian support group for ex-gays with more than 40<br>
chapters in the U.S. and abroad.<br>
<p>
Then one day he felt aroused by a woman as they walked through a field<br>
together on a warm day. 'I could have jumped over the moon,' he remembers. ' I<br>
felt like an adolescent.' Four years later, at 38, he married a woman who knew<br>
about his gay past. But over the next several years, Mr. Cook was giving nude<br>
massages to me he was supposed to be leading away from the desert of<br>
homosexuality at his spiritual redoubt, Quest Learning Center in Reading, Pa.<br>
He says the massages involved about 30 out of 250 men, whom he was trying to<br>
'desensitize' to the pleasures of the male flesh. 'It became erotic to me and<br>
I was not admitting it,' he says.<br>
<p>
When some of the men talked publicly about their sexual experiences with him,<br>
Mr. Cook resigned from the center, which closed after the Seventh-Day<br>
Adventist Church withdrew its subsidy. Mrs. Cook beat his chest with her hands<br>
when she found out. 'You've taken 12 years of my life, she cried.<br>
<p>
Six months later, he was again ministering to gays--under strict church<br>
supervision. Three years of therapy since then have also helped him become<br>
'98%' free of male fantasies, Mr. Cook says. And this year, Mr. and Mrs. Cook,<br>
who have two sons, celebrated their 14th anniversary.<br>
<p>
End of Quote<br>
<p>
I suppose we shouldn't find the unfavorable "publicity" to be surprising. Can<br>
anyone either substantiate or refute the characterization of the SDA Church<br>
support relative to the Quest Learning Center?<br>

I would imagine that the watch would not be functional, since time will<br>
no longer be.  But I have a friend who fixes clocks and watches, and I<br>
myself am an avid antique clock collector, so maybe we could get it<br>
working after all.<br>

Speaking of college being a broadening experience...  I've already<br>
told the net that I had classes from Des Ford at PUC and enjoyed them<br>
very much.  Well, I also had classes from Dennis Priebe (it is Dennis<br>
isn't it?) and I enjoyed those as well.  Both men were very personable<br>
and I liked them, yet their theology is pretty much set at 180 degrees<br>
from each other.  I also have fond memories of Ralph Larson because<br>
he was an evangelist in Northern California when I was little and I<br>
remember going to his tent meetings where there was sawdust on the floor<br>
and he showed slides of the beasts of Revelation.<br>
<p>
So what, you say?  Well, so what indeed.  I just wanted to interject the<br>
human dimension a bit here, because some of these men have been<br>
thoroughly blasted for their various doctrinal positions, and we should<br>
remember that they are indeed human and that we might be able to disagree<br>
with them without becoming disagreeable.<br>

<i>&gt; The author is obsessed with "Christian perfection," which he defines as</i><br>
<i>&gt; "total victory over sin."  He concludes that it is possible for us to work out</i><br>
<i>&gt; "a sinless character in a sinful nature."  I call this hogwash fringing on</i><br>
<p>
If you read the next sentence, it states "Perfection remains always the<br>
goal, while abiding in Christ is the method."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; blasphemy.  While the quasi-gospel Priebe endorses pays lip service to Christ</i><br>
<i>&gt; and to the Atonement,  what is really at its core is perfection by human</i><br>
<i>&gt; effort.  Christian perfection is possible only through faith in Christ</i><br>
<p>
If you read the next sentence, it states "Perfection remains always the<br>
goal, while abiding in Christ is the method."  Or, "It is not awareness<br>
of our inward holiness, but dependence on Christ."  -- Priebie<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To those in Priebe's camp, Christ's ministry on earth serves as an example</i><br>
<i>&gt; for us and little else.  If we only follow the example, we can ourselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; accomplish all that Christ accomplished.  The Atonement's main function was</i><br>
<i>&gt; to clear the way for us to work out our own salvation.  Christ's role as</i><br>
<i>&gt; our one and only Savior, there being no other name under heaven which can</i><br>
<i>&gt; save us, is barely mentioned.</i><br>
<p>
I quote Priebie again, "The gospel is both a legal verdict and transforming<br>
power.  Union with Christ is the key to the faith through which justification<br>
must take place."                ^^^<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; THE NATURE OF SIN</i><br>
<i>&gt; from us, and makes provision to cleanse us of our own sins.  Our inherited</i><br>
<i>&gt; sin is only part of the story, and the concept of inherited sin does not,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as Priebe states, remove our responsibility.</i><br>
<p>
I would have to ask, then, how could you describe Jesus as fully man?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; THE NATURE OF CHRIST</i><br>
<i>&gt; Priebe suggests that to argue that Christ was born with the pre-Fall nature</i><br>
<i>&gt; is to say that He had no connection at all with our sinful nature.</i><br>
<p>
I beg to differ.  "Any other condition except in sinful flesh would have<br>
been challenged at once by the enemy, and would have influenced the thinking<br>
of the universe."  Also, "Christ accepted voluntarily the humiliation of<br>
descending, not only to the level of unfallan man, but to the level to which<br>
man had fallen through the sin of Adam and the sins of succeeding<br>
generations."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; JUSTIFICATION</i><br>
<i>&gt; Priebe claims that these views cause an unholy overemphasis on justification,</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the exclusion of sanctification.  Yet 1 Corinthians 1:30 points to Christ</i><br>
<p>
Let me quote again, "The gospel includes justification--a uniting with<br>
Christ by faith.... and sanctification--a growing more like Christ through<br>
the daily exercise of a constantly growing faith..."  If that were the<br>
only statement about sanctification, it would suffice for me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; PERFECTION</i><br>
[Nothing specific to comment on, perhaps a re-read would help.]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; THE RESULTS</i><br>
<i>&gt; Priebe asserts that persons who believe in what he feels is an incorrect</i><br>
<i>&gt; gospel are bound to participate in the following: lowering church standards,</i><br>
<p>
Actually I find what you description of the gospel and Priebe's are very<br>
similar.  I don't want to be too hard on you, but I think it's obvious<br>
that what he says and what you say he says is very different.<br>
<p>
Which leads me to another train of thought.  It seems that whenever people<br>
get on the works/faith debate, two people can say the same thing but argue<br>
about it.  Why is that?  It seems as people (and I've found myself doing<br>
this) can't hear the word "faith" without butting in the word "works",<br>
or the other way around.<br>
<p>
Not too recently the local pastor got drilled for saying keeping the Sabbath<br>
is not essential for salvation.  Figure that one out... is it?  What about<br>
the Three Angels Messages?  If they're not essential, what is the Mark<br>
of the Beast, and why is it so important?  If it is essential, then why<br>
is it "by His grace we are saved."  If Sabbath is essential, then don't<br>
you have to say "by His grace on the condition that we keep the Sabbath<br>
and ... we are saved?"  What about people who are ignorant?<br>
<p>
The point of asking the question is NOT to get an answer, but to think<br>
about all the different ways different people will answer.  Some will<br>
answer "Yes", some will answer "No."  Could it be that coming from their<br>
perspective that they are both correct answers?!<br>
<p>
 From experience, hashing it out once again on the net isn't going to<br>
solve anything.  My question is, What will?  How can we get an agreement?<br>

Well, I'm rather surprised that principle took the precedence over<br>
financial utopia for you hypothetical administrators.  But to show you<br>
how reasonable<br>
I really am, I'll give you another chance.<br>
<p>
This time no oaths of allegiance to anyone, no censorship, nothing like that.<br>
The deal is as follows:  We donate 5 million dollars to the school, to <br>
be used for the construction of a new theology building and the funding of <br>
3 endowed chairs in theology.  All we ask is that the professors appointed<br>
to those chairs pass our standards for approval (as long as they are members<br>
in good standing of the Adventist Theological Society it should be OK).<br>
<p>
Now what do you say?<br>

I had never heard any SDA's consider soy sauce _verboten_ before.  But I <br>
guess there's a first for everything.  In the recent times of my<br>
experience with a non-SDA Chinese, she fed me several unspeakable things<br>
unawares, while<br>
I fed her "veggie meat" at least once and she was unaware that it wasn't<br>
real meat.  This brings up an interesting discussion point, namely, how<br>
much<br>
asking is too much?  Try these scenarios on for size:<br>
<p>
1)  Your co-workers invite you home for supper.  They are well aware<br>
that you are a vegetarian, and have fixed you several vegetarian dishes<br>
of Chinese food.  It looks delicious.  But what's that sauce on the<br>
fried rice?  Could it contain wine?  Or is it the dreaded soy sauce? And<br>
the dumplings.  Were they cooked in lard?  Did they throw a pork bone<br>
into <br>
the egg drop soup?  They are very gracious, and you don't fear hurting<br>
their feelings, but they don't speak English too well.  Which of the<br>
above delicacies, or other food that may be present on the table, would<br>
you question?<br>
<p>
2)  You are in Switzerland and the professor you are visiting is taking<br>
you out for dinner.  Your French is rusty at best but you figure you can<br>
handle ordering a pizza.  The one you order has _fromage_,<br>
_champignons_, _oignons_,<br>
and something called _thon_.  When your pizza arrives, thon turns out to<br>
be something that looks very much like ham (but you know it isn't,<br>
because that's _jambon_).  The professor speaks good English but has<br>
never heard of thon before either.  What do you do (remember he is<br>
paying).  <br>
<p>
Alternative:  if you decide to order the cheese fondue instead, do you<br>
worry about the wine it is cooked with?<br>
<p>
3)  You are at a classy party where numerous hors d'ouvres are available.<br>
You have a few crackers and some dip.  The dip is quite enjoyable, but<br>
you suddenly realize it contains some sort of shellfish.  Before you can <br>
spit it out the hostess walks up to you and asks how you like her dip.<br>
What do you say?  And would you ask if there was lard in the crackers?<br>
Or pig pepsin in the cheese?<br>
<p>
4)  It's been a late study night with your mates from grad school.<br>
They want to order out for some food.  You know they will probably order<br>
pepperoni pizza as usual.  Do you 1)  ask for part of the pizza without<br>
pepperoni or 2) wait till the pizza gets there and pull the pepperoni <br>
off the top.<br>
<p>
Alternative if your mates prefer Taco Bell:  You vaguely remember from<br>
your Christian Education at Adventist Schools that even the Taco Bell<br>
bean burritos are cooked with lard.  You think your mates are also aware<br>
of this.<br>
But you are fiendishly hungry for some anyway.  What should you do?<br>
<p>
<p>
[Note, the impact of the SDA colonies on fast food is not negligible.<br>
Several fast-food chains have now made it to Berrien Springs (none were<br>
there in my day).  All around the world, McDonalds will charge you the same<br>
amount whether you want meat in your hamburger or not.  But in Berrien<br>
Springs they have a discount price for a no-meat sandwich.  Subway makes<br>
sandwiches available with veggie-meat.  And Taco Bell, although it's a few<br>
miles down the road, did some of its early test market of lard-free beans<br>
in that area, and has now extended lard-free beans across its whole chain.<br>
<p>
Of course, the militant vegan community also had something to do with<br>
this.  SCT]<br>

Just a gem from the 70th Birthday celebration for C. Warren Becker, longtime <br>
organ professor at Andrews Univ., which happened over the past weekend.<br>
<p>
Dr. Becker spoke briefly at the close of the tribute in which 10 of his<br>
former and current students performed on the organ.  He said that he had<br>
begun (in the SDA church) the practice of modulating the last stanza of <br>
a hymn to the next higher key.  This was because of what he read in<br>
Great Controversy about how at the 2nd Coming the angels will sing a<br>
note higher as<br>
the redeemed rise to meet Jesus.  And here I had been following this practice<br>
myself as an organist and didn't know the reason.<br>
<p>
I find that the contemporary songs now being written are remarkably<br>
theologically correct.  (there was a time when this was not true.)  But <br>
you will hear Christian singers singing about obedience to God, <br>
the life of Christ, and good and wholesome relationships.  Also there are <br>
the many good scripture songs which Tony mentioned recently.  <br>
<p>
By contrast, look at all the various hymn verses which had to be altered<br>
to make the SDA hymnal.  And probably some weren't that should have been.<br>
For instance:  "When I fall on my knees, with my face to the rising sun,<br>
O Lord have mercy on me."  Is this referred to in Ezekiel 8:16?  On the other<br>
hand, such people are in need of mercy, so maybe the line is good.<br>

I can see that we got ripped off when we bought the pot plants for our lounge<br>
room. They obviously have very bad taste when it comes to music! Then again,<br>
I don't listen to metal...I could try an experiment I guess, but I wouldn't<br>
want to waste the purchase price of a suitable CD. <br>

the American usage, which applies that term to hemp or marijuana.  SCT]<br>

I'll even go farther and say that we NEED men like Priebe, Ford, and<br>
Larson to express their opinions, thus giving us a chance to dig deeply<br>
into the Word of God and mine its treasures for ourselves.  If they are<br>
earnest searchers of God's Word, yielding to God's Spirit, and willing to<br>
be open-minded and not accusatory or critical of those who take different<br>
theological positions, men like these are very much to be coveted by the<br>
church for the insight, thought and study that they inspire in all of us. <br>
I agree with Lola one-hundred-percent.<br>
<p>
I would also remind Lola that we who take different viewpoints have as<br>
much right to express ourselves as do the men whose theological positions<br>
we are discussing.  I personally don't think anyone has been "blasted" on<br>
this forum; I believe there has been open, honest, and fruitful debate<br>
concerning the issues raised by some of these men.  "Blasted" is an<br>
inappropriate adjective here.<br>
<p>
The danger comes when teachers of God's Word become purposely critical,<br>
accusatory, denunciatory -- dredging up negativity to heap upon God's<br>
Advent people.  I'm not necessarily saying that Priebe, Ford, and/or<br>
Larson specifically have done this; I'm just noting that when it happens,<br>
the offending individuals are running a great risk spiritually.<br>

OK Steve, I'm still on the first conditions.<br>
I did not respond the first time.  But if my school needs the money but I'm not<br>
happy with the conditions, how about if I dwell on the very last condition.  If<br>
I do not abide with the the conditions, the money will go to the sister school. <br>
So, I go to the principal of the other school and explain thing to her.  Then I<br>
respond no to my dictatorial benefactor.  The sister school gets the money<br>
anyway and hopefully with no strings attached (at least you did not say so).  <br>

Ruben,<br>
I'm sorry, but again, I disagree with you totally.  I could fill the<br>
mailboxes of every SDANet member with pages of arguments, as you have<br>
tried to to do, but I won't because I stand by my previously-stated<br>
position.  I believe it is Scriptural, and I believe it<br>
is correct.  I honestly feel there is a grave problem with your<br>
interpretation of sin.  You're soft on sin, despite your emphasis on<br>
overcoming ALL SIN in this life.  You are failing to recognize the<br>
MAGNITUDE of the sin problem in which we are all mired, and IN WHICH WE<br>
ARE MIRED FROM CONCEPTION.  You're afraid that if you acknowledge what a<br>
DEEP PIT of sin we are all in, that you might be led to feel that there's<br>
no way out.  Well, I tell you today that the deeper the pit the GREATER is<br>
our Savior, Jesus Christ!<br>
<p>
When Adam and Eve transgressed, they deserved to die that very moment, and<br>
so did ALL OF US WHO WERE PRESENT THERE IN EDEN IN THE GENETIC CODE OF OUR<br>
FIRST PARENTS.  Yes, we were present there, and we deserved to die as much<br>
as Adam &amp; Eve did.  You complain about God not being fair in attributing<br>
guilt to Adam and Eve's progeny -- to me, that argument just doesn't fly. <br>
Where would we be today if Adam &amp; Eve had received their just punishment<br>
in Eden?  God IS MORE THAN FAIR in providing a way of escape from the pit<br>
of sin in which we are fallen.  It is Satan who has always accused God of<br>
being unfair.<br>
<p>
Also, I have never argued that we are to be saved IN our sins rather than<br>
FROM our sins.  I believe we are saved from our sins by faith in Jesus and<br>
by His grace.  My constant emphasis has been that it is CHRIST'S WORK in<br>
us, and not any of our doing.  There is NOT ONE THREAD OF OUR OWN DEVISING<br>
in the quiltwork of our salvation.  Our role is to accept as a little<br>
child accepts the love of his parents.<br>
<p>
Christ gets all the glory.  That is my burden.  But I have never meant to<br>
suggest that the Christian life involves no effort at all -- that we<br>
simply ride Christ's coattails into heaven (although I can think of no one<br>
better to ride on).  The Christian life remains a struggle even after<br>
conversion, and only by our moment-by-moment reliance on Christ can He<br>
overcome in us.  Once again, it is all of Him and none of us.  The good<br>
works that we do are His -- not ours, just as our salvation is fully<br>
wrapped up in Him.<br>

internet access<br>
--------------------------------<br>
<p>
<p>
Source-Info: From (or Sender) name not authenticated.<br>
<p>
Del Mar Communications has established a data center to provide free <br>
Internet connectivity to the general public.  We call it "Speedway".<br>
<p>
We have installed a large bank of V.32bis-capable modems, and more will <br>
be added as usage increases.<br>
<p>
Our first offering is UUCP, SLIP, and PPP connections with unlimited <br>
connect time.  We receive thousands of Usenet newsgroups, including <br>
many regional groups and groups from foreign countries, and will be <br>
happy to pass on any number of them.  Our direct high-speed Internet<br>
connection means there will be few if any delays in the sending and <br>
receiving of electronic mail or news articles.  We can also act as your <br>
site's Internet mail forwarder, and our dial-up modems can be used to <br>
access other sites on the Internet.  Just log in as telnet or rlogin <br>
(when using rlogin, press &lt;Return&gt; at the first Password: prompt to <br>
receive a login prompt from the distant host).<br>
<p>
In the future, we plan to offer a BBS and Unix shell accounts.<br>
<p>
Our services are completely free.  All you pay for is the telephone<br>
call.  Using one of AT&amp;T's "Reach Out" plans, this can be very<br>
inexpensive.  If you currently spend many hours dialed up to a UUCP<br>
feed that is a local call, then clearly our service is not for you.<br>
But if your current feed is a toll call, even in your same area, or if<br>
you are now paying usage charges, you may well find that it would<br>
be cheaper and more convenient to use our "Speedway" service and just <br>
pay for the call.<br>
<p>
Because our only connection to the Public Switched Telephone Network is <br>
via digital connection to AT&amp;T, calls to our service must arrive via AT&amp;T.  <br>
In most of the U.S.A., this can be accomplished by prepending 10ATT to <br>
your dial string, i.e.  10288-1-503-520-2222.  Our data center is <br>
located in Portland, Oregon, so callers from Northern Oregon can not <br>
reach our service at the present time unless they dial 1-800-32-10ATT <br>
and bill the call to their calling card.  This also means that you can <br>
not reach us via PC Pursuit.<br>
 <br>
Calls from foreign countries arrive on various long-distance carriers,<br>
at random.  You may have to try a few times, but you should be able to<br>
get through.  If your call arrives on a carrier other than AT&amp;T, you<br>
will hear a busy signal and will not be charged.<br>
<p>
If you are interested in any of our services, please send e-mail to<br>
support@speedway.net and we will set up a free account for you.<br>
<p>
Thank You,<br>

&gt; I would indeed like an internet access account.  I would like to have
&gt; FTP access.  
<p>
We plan to start offering shell accounts in the next few days.  Try
logging in as 'new' in a few days.
<p>
<p>
&gt; Currently I am running UUCP.  My site name is 
&gt; knapper.cactus.org.
&gt; I would like a mail feed for UUCP, with some news groups to be added later.
<p>
If you would like to set up a UUCP account, send us the name of your
site.  If you don't already have a domain name you can use ours.  For
example, if your site's UUCP name is foobar, you would be
foobar.speedway.net, and people would send mail to
user@foobar.speedway.net.  If you have your own registered domain name
and are currently getting your mail from another site, then we have to
arrange to change your nameserver record.  This takes about a week and
we can handle the paperwork for you.
<p>
If you would also like to receive a newsfeed, let us know what groups
you want to get and at about what time (Pacific Time) you expect to call 
in and receive news, so that we can batch it up just before you call.  This 
assumes that you have news software all up and running on your machine.

<i>&gt;&gt;[Michael Merginio writes:]</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; A college/university is supposed to be a place where alternate thought</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;[Fred writes:]</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;secular institution.  It's typical humanist-type statement.  But I recommend</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;caution in such an application to a Christian college/university.  Why?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Because, like humanism, it leaves God out of the picture.</i><br>
<p>
[TracyAnne Burtch-Nickless writes:]<br>
<i>&gt;I read 'alternate thought' to mean being able to think on their own.</i><br>
<p>
Fair 'nuff; it just sounded, understood broadly, like what humanists say.<br>
<p>
[Bill Nickless writes:]<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; [Michael] </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; The college experience is to be one where a person should</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; be allowed to find the true being within oneself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; [Fred]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Echos from the 60s.  One cannot find oneself independent of Christ.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; He has a design and a purpose for each one of us (Ps 139:13-17).  Indeed,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; without Him, we could not be (e.g., 1 Sam 1:6,19,20; Acts 17:28); we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not the result of some random or chance event.</i><br>
[Bill] <br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps I don't understand your response to Michael Merginio, but what I</i><br>
<i>&gt; read disturbs me.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry 8-).  I did not wish to be perceived as slamming Michael or<br>
promoting "know nothing".  That's why I chose to describe my comments<br>
as referring to the "broadest interpretation" (i.e., going beyond<br>
the face value) and "recommend[ing] caution".  Michael's .sig speaks of<br>
being totally honest.  I apologize for evidently being less than tactful.<br>
<p>
Permit me to elaborate somewhat, as I reckon you're actually thinking of<br>
more of my comments than just the above quote.  I was expressing caution<br>
regarding inquiry that recognizes no restraint, that considers all knowledge<br>
amoral.  "Alternate thought" (Michael may well have had a more moderate<br>
connotation in mind) and "academic freedom" have been used to demand license<br>
to be libertine.  Would this be wise policy for a Christian institution?<br>
<p>
For example, when I was at Andrews in the early 70s, I recall students<br>
arguing that a subscription to Playboy magazine at the James White library<br>
would be justified since it contained "serious" material (mingled with<br>
porn); and that to do otherwise would be censorship most reprehensible (!).<br>
(And there were rumors that the library did have such a subscription,<br>
but I have no idea if that was true.)<br>
<p>
In an Education class I took, a question was posed on a test:  In an English<br>
literature class, would it be appropriate to study a book that included<br>
immorality? [*]  At that time, I argued that it was incumbent for us<br>
to be acquainted with the great works of Literature, past and present,<br>
and that we were mature enough adults to handle "Lady Chatterley's Lover"<br>
or Ericha Jong's "Fear of Flying" or whatever.  My teacher may not have<br>
understood me, but I distinctly recall him saying he agreed with me<br>
when I discussed my test paper with him.<br>
<p>
[*} Yes, I know that the Bible contains immorality.  But it does not<br>
detail it (i.e., not lewd) and *does* present its consequences.  Popular<br>
literature often details/celebrates immorality and commonly presents it<br>
as w/o negative consequence.<br>
<p>
(Not long thereafter, I encountered a pastor who felt similarly and whose<br>
library contained Lady Chatterley's Lover and others whose characters<br>
lived immorally.  I confess with grief that I read some of those books<br>
and now dearly wish I hadn't; memories of text passages sometimes come<br>
back to mind.)<br>
<p>
In the twenty years since I hope I have grown wiser.  While I wasn't<br>
aware of Ps 101:3 ("I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes"),<br>
I did know Phil 4:8.  But I had adjusted my view of theology to accomodate<br>
my morality.<br>
<p>
I submit that teachers in Christian institutions should be spiritually-wise,<br>
not worldly-wise, in selecting materials for examination.  That would<br>
exclude many things, unlike secular practice.<br>
<p>
But what about one's personal convictions?  2 Cor 10:5 urges us to make our<br>
thoughts captive to the obedience of Christ, eschewing every imagined or real<br>
thing that exalts itself (Gen 3:5) against the knowledge of God.  Why proscribe<br>
ourselves?  Because of the universal, non-optional principle that our<br>
thoughts and characters are shaped by what comes in thru our senses and<br>
by what we dwell on.  We can use this principle to our spiritual benefit<br>
(2 Cor 3:18, "beholding .. the glory [character] of the Lord,.. changed into<br>
the same image from glory to glory" [character sanctification, imparted<br>
righteousness]; see also GC 478) or to our spiritual detriment (see PP 459,<br>
context of Balaam's revenge in "Apostasy at the Jordan").<br>
<p>
Why not heed 2 Cor 6:14-18 ("... wherefore come out from among them, and be<br>
ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will<br>
receive you ...") and Rom 12:2?  Why not center education on the Source of<br>
true education ("the knowledge of the holy is understanding", Prov 9:10;<br>
"acquaint now thyself with him", Job 22:21; in Him "are hid all the<br>
treasures of wisdom", Col 2:3)?  Are we missing out on the fullness possible<br>
in restoring in mankind the image of God physically, mentally, and spiritually?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Starting from first principles: I believe that it was God's intent to</i><br>
<i>&gt; create humanity with intelligence, creativity, and the capacity for</i><br>
<i>&gt; independent thought.  (God created man in his own image; Genesis 1:27.)</i><br>
<p>
Absolutely!  We agree.  My caution is that an "independent spirit" (e.g.,<br>
Rev 3:17) can be mistaken for "independent thought".  Anyway .. here's a<br>
quote on godly independent thought (Education p17-19):<br>
<p>
  Every human being, created in the image of God, is endowed with a power<br>
  akin to that of the Creator - individuality, power to think and to do.<br>
  ... It is the work of true education to develop this power, to train the<br>
  youth to be thinkers, and not mere reflectors of other men's thoughts.<br>
  Instead of confining their study to that which men have said or written<br>
  [textbooks, the library - fgc], let students be directed to the sources<br>
  of truth, to the vast fields opened for research in nature and revelation.<br>
  Let them contemplate the great facts of duty and destiny, and the mind<br>
  will expand and strengthen.  Instead of educated weaklings, institutions<br>
  of learning may send forth men [and women] strong to think and to act,<br>
  men who are masters and not slaves of circumstances, men who possess<br>
  breath of mind, clearness of thought, and the courage of their<br>
  convictions [stand alone, despite peer pressure].<br>
<p>
  Such an education provides more than mental discipline; it provides<br>
  more than physical training.  It strengthens character, so that truth<br>
  and uprightness are not sacrificed to selfish desire or worldly<br>
  ambition.  It fortifies the mind against evil.  Instead of some master<br>
  passion becoming a power to destroy, every motive and desire are<br>
  brought into conformity to the great principles of right.  As the<br>
  perfection of His character is dwelt upon, the mind is renewed, and<br>
  the soul is re-created in the image of God.<br>
<p>
  What education can be higher than this? ... Higher than the highest<br>
  human thought can reach is God's ideal for His children.  [I often<br>
  heard this one, but it needs the next to be complete -fgc]  Godliness --<br>
  godlikeness -- is the goal to be reached.  Before the student is<br>
  opened a path of continual progress.  He has an objective to achieve,<br>
  a standard to attain, that includes everything good, and pure, and<br>
  noble.  He will advance as fast and as far as possible in every<br>
  branch of true knowledge [hence, there is false knowledge -fgc].  But<br>
  his efforts will be directed to objects as much higher than mere<br>
  selfish and temporal interests as the heavens are higher than the earth.<br>
<p>
  .. an education that cannot be completed in this life, but that will be<br>
  continued in the life to come; ...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's not very far from the statement you make above "One cannot find</i><br>
<i>&gt; oneself independent of Christ" to "our children cannot find Christ</i><br>
<i>&gt; unless we apply great pressure on them to conform to our beliefs, both</i><br>
<i>&gt; in thought and action."</i><br>
<p>
I'm afraid I see a large chasm to be leaped between them.  I was thinking<br>
of Prov 18:2:  "A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart<br>
may discover itself."  Surely you remember that "find myself" was a<br>
trendy phrase during the 60s and 70s.  Vast hordes of people rejected<br>
the morality/mores/manners/materialism of their parents, and not always<br>
without good reason, and sought meaning and purpose.  They tried drugs,<br>
free love, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, TM, the Peace Corps, and sometimes<br>
Jesus.  Many (most?), without a moral compass, without a Scriptural basis,<br>
ended up opting for hedonism.  I think we would agree that what they<br>
were searching, unmindfully, to fulfill was that which only Christ<br>
can supply in a relationship that accepts Him as Lord and Savior.<br>
<p>
I appreciate your concern for how we treat those who step out "out<br>
of bounds", so to speak.  Reminds me of Isa 42:3:  "A bruised reed shall<br>
he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench .."  Wisdom,<br>
indeed, is needed.  I would submit, tho, that rebellion need not be<br>
considered a normal part of adolescence.  Questioning to learn,<br>
and not just to hassle, is commendable:  1 Pet 3:15, "be ready always to<br>
give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is<br>
in you with meekness and fear."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A much more successful method is to make the</i><br>
<i>&gt; truth attractive, relevant, and available.  But beyond that, it must be</i><br>
<i>&gt; tolerant of discussion against it.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed.  I've read some of Francis Schaeffer's books and it appears he<br>
understood how rather well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Have faith that the truth is the truth, and that reasonable, growing</i><br>
<i>&gt; young minds will be capable of seeing it for what it is.</i><br>
<p>
Again a caution:  Rom 8:7 ".. the carnal mind is enmity against God:<br>
for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."<br>
1 Cor 2:14 "But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God:<br>
for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are<br>
spiritually discerned."<br>
Reasonable, growing young minds that are not resisting God's Spirit, yes,<br>
which emphasizes the need for intercessory prayer, IMHO.<br>
<p>
Isa 55:11 "So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not<br>
return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it<br>
shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it."<br>
My faith rests in God, not in logic.  On reflection, I imagine you'd agree.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Be a channel</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the Holy Spirit to gently persuade, and not a tool of the devil,</i><br>
<i>&gt; making the Gospel irritating and bitter.</i><br>
<p>
Amen!<br>

I would disagree with Noe that Gospel presented in Priebe's article is a <br>
"new gospel" (under the guise of "historic Adventism") centered on salvation <br>
by human effort. <br>
<p>
The Adventist gospel has always uplifted Christ far higher than the reformation<br>
gospel because it elevates what Christ can do, is doing and will do for man<br>
many times higher than conceived by those who only assert Christ's forgiving<br>
(justifying) ministry. It also brings into view the restoration that Christ<br>
makes in every human being. Yes effort is involved the effort of choosing<br>
Christ above self and sin, and yes it is a hard and difficult choice to make<br>
being against the natural desires of the human heart. The centre of this<br>
gospel is not human effort it is Christ without whom the effort is useless<br>
but the effort is a necessary component. Those of you who have an index<br>
to the writings of EGW look up how many references there are to Effort<br>
and you will see many pages of refereces where EGW affirms the important<br>
and necessary role of human effort in the process of salvation. AND NO this<br>
is not legalism and before you all jump to false conclusions, look up the<br>
index and see exactly what type of effort she refers to.<br>
<p>
Regarding the concept of total victory over sin, is this not scriptural ?<br>
<p>
Matt 1:21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS:<br>
          for he shall save his people from their sins. (KJV)<br>
<p>
<p>
Jesus came to save us FROM sin not IN sin ! IF Jesus isn't saving you from<br>
your sins then you are not being saved.<br>
<p>
1 Cor 10:13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man:<br>
            but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above<br>
            that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to<br>
            escape, that ye may be able to bear it. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Now if God won't allow you to be tempted more than you can resist and thereby<br>
not commits sin, then why is it that we continue sinning, is it because we can<br>
not overcome, NO NEVER !, it is because we don't really want to overcome.<br>
<p>
Heb 12:4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. (KJV)<br>
<p>
This is the secret why, we don't overcome, we give in too easily.<br>
<p>
2 Cor 10:4 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through<br>
           God to the pulling down of strong holds;) (KJV)<br>
2 Cor 10:5 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth<br>
           itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity<br>
           every thought to the obedience of Christ; (KJV)<br>
<p>
Now if every thought is in obedience to Christ, will we do wrong actions,<br>
will we think perverse thoughts ?, NO impossible. then what is the cause of<br>
our shortcomming... we don't use the weapons of our warfare that  Christ has<br>
provided, we prefer to use our own weapons.<br>
<p>
1 Cor 15:57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord<br>
            Jesus Christ. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Yes, He does, total and complete, a perfect victory, for those who really<br>
seek it with ALL their heart.<br>
<p>
Phil 4:13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. (KJV)<br>
<p>
That is ALL not some ALL things, including victory over sin !<br>
<p>
Gal 5:16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust<br>
         of the flesh. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Again, if we WALK in the Spirit we will not sin. because the fulfilling the<br>
lust of the flesh as James tells us is sin.<br>
<p>
Gal 2:20 I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but<br>
         Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I<br>
         live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself<br>
         for me. (KJV)<br>
<p>
If in verity Christ lives His perfect life in you, as He truely desires to<br>
do, will He commit sin in you ?, If you are truely dead to self, and you<br>
no longer reign in your body but you are subect in all to the Lord (Note this<br>
is why He is called Lord) will you disobey ?, NO impossible, Christ life<br>
was a life of perfect obedience and if you let Christ live His life perfectly<br>
in you, your life will be a life of perfect obedience too.<br>
<p>
1 Pet 2:21 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for<br>
           us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: (KJV)<br>
1 Pet 2:22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: (KJV)<br>
<p>
Thats it the example, and this is not a carrot on the stick philosophy either.<br>
God does not treat us like mules.<br>
<p>
2 Pet 2:9 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to<br>
          reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: (KJV)<br>
<p>
Does He really know how to deliver me from temptation ? or is this just a <br>
literary ploy to grab our attention. Why do we doubt God ? Isn't faith supposed<br>
to mean that we beleive and trust his Word. ?<br>
<p>
Jude 1:24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present<br>
          you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,<br>
<p>
And again <br>
<p>
Rev 3:21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even<br>
         as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.<br>
<p>
How did Jesus overcome ?, part time ?<br>
<p>
1 Cor 9:24 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one<br>
           receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. (KJV)<br>
1 Cor 9:25 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all<br>
           things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an<br>
           incorruptible. (KJV)<br>
1 Cor 9:26 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that<br>
           beateth the air: (KJV)<br>
1 Cor 9:27 But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that<br>
           by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a<br>
           castaway. (KJV)<br>
<p>
As for effort Paul tells us that sure enough he hasn't been shadow boxing <br>
against temptation, its been a real fight.<br>
<p>
<p>
1 John 2:1 "My little children, these things I write unto you, that ye sin not.<br>
            And if any man sin we have an advocate with the Father, <br>
            Jesus Christ the righteous." <br>
<p>
<p>
Here are a few EGW quotes :<br>
<p>
"Not even by a thought did He yield to temptation. So it may be with us." <br>
							DA 123<br>
<p>
"Jesus revealed no qualities, and exercised no powers, that men may not<br>
have through faith in Him. His perfect humanity is that which all His <br>
followers may possess, if they wil be insubjection to God as He was." DA 664<br>
<p>
"He has made it possible for you to be an overcomer. Do not say it is<br>
impossible to overcome. Do not say. 'It is my nature to do thus and so, <br>
and I cannot do otherwise. I have inhereted weaknesses that make me <br>
powerless before temptation." We know you cannot overcome in your own<br>
strength; but help has been laid upon One who is mighty to save." ST II, 295<br>
<p>
"Christ has given us no assurance that to attain to perfection of<br>
character is an easy matter. It is a conflict, a battle, and a march,<br>
day by day." RH VI, 33<br>
<p>
"He says to them, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your father which<br>
is in heaven is perfect." And He says this because He knows that it is <br>
possible for them to reach perfection." ST IV,216<br>
<p>
"Exact obedience is required and those that say that it is not possible<br>
to live a perfect life throw upon God the imputation of injustice and<br>
untruth." Ms 147; RH Feb7, 1957<br>
<p>
<p>
This is not " hogwash fringing on blasphemy" This is the 1888 message, the<br>
loud cry message rejected by the church then and now, no wonder Christ<br>
still hasn't come.<br>
<p>
As to the point that our good works flow out of our love and appreciation for <br>
our wonderful Savior, this is completely true. No our works do not earn us <br>
salvation, no matter how good they are, Never-the-less our sins surely<br>
cause our damnation. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To those in Priebe's camp, Christ's ministry on earth serves as an example</i><br>
<i>&gt; for us and little else.  If we only follow the example, we can ourselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; accomplish all that Christ accomplished. </i><br>
<p>
Christs life serves as our example and His atoning death as our substitute.<br>
Christ's life verily is our example.<br>
<p>
<p>
John 5:19 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto<br>
          you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father<br>
          do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son<br>
          likewise. (KJV)<br>
<p>
John 14:10 Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?<br>
           the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the<br>
           Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. (KJV)<br>
John 14:12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works<br>
           that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he<br>
           do; because I go unto my Father. (KJV)<br>
<p>
<p>
"By His perfect obedience He has made it possible for every human being<br>
to obey God's commandments. When we submit ourselves to Christ, the heart <br>
is united with his heart, the will is merged in His will, the mind becomes<br>
one with His mind, the thoughts are brough into captivity to Him; we live <br>
His life. This is what it means to be clothed with the garment of His<br>
righteousness." COL 312.<br>
<p>
<p>
"Jesus revealed no qualities, and exercised no powers, that men may not<br>
have through faith in Him. His perfect humanity is that which all His <br>
followers may possess, if they wil be insubjection to God as He was." DA 664<br>
<p>
<p>
"Satan....is constantly seeking to deceive the followers of Christ<br>
with his fatal sophistry that it is impossible for them to overcome...<br>
Let none, then, regard their defects as incurable. God will give faith<br>
and grace to overcome them." GC 489<br>
<p>
<p>
Regarding the statment<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Atonement's main function was</i><br>
<i>&gt; to clear the way for us to work out our own salvation.  Christ's role as</i><br>
<i>&gt; our one and only Savior, there being no other name under heaven which can</i><br>
<i>&gt; save us, is barely mentioned.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
This really is a misunderstanding of the whole process of sanctification<br>
and the role it plays in our lives. Christ's death is necessary to justify us<br>
or in plain language to forgive us our sins. His life is necessary to<br>
give us power and victory over sin, in neither case do we work out<br>
our own salvation, the victory over sin isn't for us to save ourselves, its<br>
for us to stop doing those things which crucified Christ. Do we wish to<br>
continue indulging in the things that caused Christ's death ?<br>
<p>
<p>
Mind you, even those who have attained moral perfection and live without sin<br>
are still SAVED ONLY through the grace of God. The present lives<br>
do not and can not atone for passed sin, which can be forgiven only through the<br>
blood of Christ and the power to live a holy life is only received as we <br>
partake of Him daily. "Christ in you is the hope of glory" Col 1:27.<br>
<p>
As to the use of Ps. 51:5 to uphold the doctrine of original sin, this is<br>
incorrect because it is only through eisogesis that this can be affirmed.<br>
The verse does not say that guilt is inhereted.<br>
<p>
<p>
Regarding the notion of Christ being excempt from mans post fall incliination<br>
to sin, then how is it that He was tempted in all points like as we are ?<br>
<p>
James tells us very clearly that our temptations arise from our own lust<br>
ie our own (post fall) inclination to sin. If Christ did not have the same<br>
inclination to sin that we have then He could not have been tempted in the<br>
same way we are and so the clear teaching of scripture must be put aside.<br>

<i>&gt; Isn't it interesting that many SDAs would prefer to sing an old hymn that</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; God told Adam and Eve that IN THE DAY that they ate of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; tree of knowledge, they would die.  They were guilty.  They deserved to</i><br>
<i>&gt; die ON THE SPOT, and THEIR SEED SHARES IN THE RESULTS OF THEIR GUILT.  </i><br>
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
<p>
Where is this found in Genesis ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  "The sin of Adam plunged</i><br>
<i>&gt; the race in hopeless misery and despair" (4T 293).  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
This does not say that every man inherets guilt, this says that man<br>
suffers the consequences of living in a world where sin reigns.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Bible says that ALL have sinned (Rom. 3:23); I don't see justification</i><br>
<i>&gt; for excluding (1) persons before the age of accountability, or (2) persons</i><br>
<i>&gt; before they knowingly and willingly commit their first sin. </i><br>
<p>
It does not us when ALL have sinned, it just makes a statement that all<br>
have sinned at some time in their lives. Whether this sin happened<br>
on their 34th birthday or we are not told. Further more how can someone<br>
commit sin without knowning it? The bible clearly teaches that Sin is breaking <br>
the law  (1 John 4:2) and doing what you know is wrong so until you can <br>
scripturally show that sin is something that happens unconsciously this <br>
argument is null.<br>
<p>
 "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the<br>
    transgression of the law." 1 John 3:4 <br>
<p>
   "Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him<br>
    it is sin." James 4:17 (KJV)<br>
<p>
<p>
There is no sin where there is no knowledge of it.<br>
<p>
   "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but<br>
    now they have no cloke for their sin."John 15:22 <br>
<p>
   "If I had not done among them the works which none other man did,<br>
    they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me<br>
    and my Father."John 15:24  <br>
<p>
   "Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but<br>
    now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth." John 9:41<br>
   "Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the<br>
    mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and<br>
    Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.<br>
    But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon<br>
    at the day of judgment, than for you.<br>
    And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be<br>
    brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done<br>
    in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this<br>
    day. But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of<br>
    Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.<br>
    At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord<br>
    of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the<br>
    wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. "Matt 11:21-25 <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Galatians 3:22</i><br>
<i>&gt; underscores this fact: "...the scripture hath concluded ALL under sin, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
This does not mean that all people were assigned sin even if they had not<br>
commited it, that would not only be unethical, and unloving but unjust. My<br>
God is not so evil as to condemn me to death for something I have not done.<br>
What type of God do you serve ?<br>
<p>
God judges me by what I have done, not because of my birth.<br>
<p>
. "And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books<br>
    were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life:<br>
    and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in<br>
    the books, according to their works. <br>
    And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell<br>
    delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every<br>
    man according to their works." Rev 20:12-13<br>
<p>
   "For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret<br>
    thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil." Ecc 12:14 <br>
<p>
 What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel,<br>
   saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth<br>
   are set on edge? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have <br>
   occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel. <br>
   Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the<br>
   soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die." Eze 18:2-4 <br>
<p>
  "Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall sons be put to<br>
   death for their fathers, everyone shall be put to death for his own sin."<br>
    Deut. 24:16,<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity," David said, "and in sin did my mother</i><br>
<i>&gt; conceive me" (Ps. 51:5).  David isn't talking about a predisposition to</i><br>
<i>&gt; sin -- he's taking about SIN.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
No this verse does not say that he inhereted guilt ! this verse only says that<br>
he was born in a sinful environment. That is exegesis, where else could he<br>
go to be born ? Lets face it this world is enveloped with sin and its effects.<br>
<p>
What then say you regarding <br>
<p>
 "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth<br>
    out of the womb I sanctified thee,"Jeremiah 1:5 <br>
<p>
<p>
   See also Luke 1:13-15, and Isa 59:2. <br>
<p>
Were Jeremiah, Isaiah and John the baptist also born "separated from God"<br>
or were they born under the condemnation of original sin. Explain then<br>
how is it that they were born sanctified ? The two can not co-exist.<br>
<p>
Niether Rom 5:12-19 nor Ps 51:5 teach original sin. Rom 5 says<br>
<p>
Rom 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by<br>
         sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:<br>
                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
Please note: this verse ONLY tells us that death came upon all men<br>
BECAUSE ALL HAVE COMMITTED SIN !!!!! This is the context and any conclusions<br>
drawn from the following verses must be subject to this statement.<br>
<p>
<p>
Rom 5:15 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the<br>
         offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift<br>
         by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.<br>
Rom 5:16 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the<br>
         judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many<br>
         offences unto justification. <br>
Rom 5:17 For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they<br>
         which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness<br>
         shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) (KJV)<br>
Rom 5:18 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to<br>
         condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came<br>
         upon all men unto justification of life. (KJV)<br>
Rom 5:19 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the<br>
         obedience of one shall many be made righteous. (KJV)<br>
<p>
OK. NOW lets see what these verses ACTUALLY say,<br>
They tell us that Just like SIN and DEATH entered into the world through Adam<br>
 Salvation and LIFE enters in the same way through Christ!!! So that<br>
IF you say that we are all guilty irrespective of our choice because of<br>
Adam's sin. Then you must also say that we are all saved irrespective of<br>
our choice because of Christ's righteousness. This is known as<br>
universalism and is NOT ON!!! The wicked will NOT BE SAVED irrespective of<br>
their choices but only as they chose righteousness. Likewise condemnation<br>
only falls on those who choose to sin!!<br>
<p>
I am sorry but Rom 5 does not support the doctrine of Original sin. <br>
Only as we participate in sin does the penalty fall on us. The fact that <br>
Adam was the one who brought sin into the world does not mean that <br>
I incur his penalty UNLESS I MYSELF SIN. yes ALL have sinned, why ? <br>
Because none in themselves can oversome sin because of their depraved natures <br>
only Christ in us can break the hold of sin in our lives. So that until <br>
we meet Jesus we sin unavoidably, and so all have sinned and all have  <br>
incurred the penalty because all participate in Adam's sin. <br>

Well, Steve, you've done it now! 8-)  You've gone from preaching to meddling.<br>
I mean, did you have to go from theory to reality?  (groan) ;-) 8-)<br>
<p>
[Steven Timm writes:]<br>
<i>&gt; I had never heard any SDA's consider soy sauce _verboten_ before.  But I </i><br>
<i>&gt; guess there's a first for everything.</i><br>
<p>
Was that me?  I think I just said our family found Bragg's "Liquid<br>
Aminos" (what a name!) preferable for a couple of reasons.  No big deal.<br>
Just trying to go for the best.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1)  Your co-workers invite you home for supper.  They are well aware</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you are a vegetarian, and have fixed you several vegetarian dishes</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Chinese food.  [wine? lard? not wish to offend]</i><br>
<p>
OK, I'll take an on-the-spot stab, given that's what I'd be under.<br>
Pray for wisdom and right words.  Wine's specific gravity is different<br>
enough that you might be able to detect it and simply not eat more; dunno.<br>
You could gently ask the cook what the ingredients were and how they<br>
were cooked, showing genuine interest; after all, they went to a lot of<br>
work.  Keep the results under your hat.  Carefully consider what to do.<br>
Reflect on what you may or may not know about Luke 10:8, and 1 Cor 10:27.<br>
Consider the merits of perhaps better preparing prospective hosts.<br>
<p>
I'll tell one on myself.  I'm 4 years old, family is in India, and we're<br>
invited to a wedding feast.  The mutton pulao (sp?) is served.  I'd<br>
never seen meat served before, except to our dog.  I pipe up, "Mom!<br>
Why are they feeding us dog food?"  Much embarrasment ...<br>
<p>
Btw, in India, it would be totally proper to indicate that your religion<br>
led you to eat/not eat certain foods.  No host would be offended, given<br>
forewarning.  That sort of thing is quite common.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2)  You are in Switzerland and the professor you are visiting is taking</i><br>
<i>&gt; you out for dinner.  [pizza with ?? or fondue?]</i><br>
<p>
Pizza Hut in paradise?  Horrors!  Seriously, take your best shot and adapt,<br>
if necessary.  Oh .. fondue has the alcohol (wine *and* cherry liqueuer)<br>
cooked out it .. usually.  Don't forget to wipe your caquelon with garlic.<br>
It's not easy being vegetarian while travelingin Europe, or at least it<br>
sure wasn't 20 years ago.  Hooray for yoghurt, petit Suisses, and baguettes!<br>
Where's the nearest Migros? (no better yoghurt anywhere!)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3)  You are at a classy party where numerous hors d'oeuvres are available.</i><br>
<i>&gt; [crackers, dip, shellfish? lard? pig pepsin?]</i><br>
<p>
Tell her you found the taste fascinatingly unique, a certain mysterious<br>
arriere gout.  As casually as possible, scan the terrain and chose your<br>
targets.  Save the embarrasing questions and lectures; it's probably the<br>
wrong time (cf. Prov 27:14).  Consider having the party at your place<br>
next time and wow 'em with delicious natural and whole foods.  Weimar's<br>
Country Kitchen recipe book has lots of nifty ideas.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Alternative if your mates prefer Taco Bell:  You vaguely remember from</i><br>
<i>&gt; your Christian Education at Adventist Schools that even the Taco Bell</i><br>
<i>&gt; bean burritos are cooked with lard.  You think your mates are also aware</i><br>
<i>&gt; of this. But you are fiendishly hungry for some anyway.  What should you do?</i><br>
<p>
Preferring to "make a run for the border", I'll take the alternative.  'Sides,<br>
it was a pastor who told me TB beans were lard-free, an' you can always<br>
believe them, right? 8-)  Consider the benefits of stocking your grad<br>
student office mini-fridge (you do have one, right?) with munchables such<br>
as fresh fruit, dried fruit, nuts, herb crackers and other delicacies.<br>
Unless you're willing to share, you might end up having to put a lock<br>
on it.  Even "carnivores" have been known to exhibit tastes for such. 8-)<br>
<p>
Btw, I recently referred to Drs Diehl, Lee, MacDougal, et al having cooking<br>
materials on vegan diets.  I was probably inaccurate.  I checked with<br>
a vegetarian friend here at work; "vegan" seems to have a connotation<br>
which I do not totally grasp, beyond vegetarian, so I may have misapplied<br>
the term.  Nevertheless, I do like what these Drs have to say.<br>

Tim,<br>
<p>
Why are you cluttering up the net with this nonsense?  I learned long<br>
ago that "What If..." is a no-win game.  You want to get it out of your<br>
system, sneak into a showing of "Indecent Proposal" when none of the<br>
good church folks are watching...unless this whole exercise is the<br>
Adventist version.<br>

The outpouring of faith in the leadership, and the incredible amount of <br>
standing for principle here, has taken me by surprise.  Not even those<br>
who support that theological view have written in support of taking<br>
the money.  So why did I bring it up?<br>
<p>
As I said, the situation is a paraphrase of an episode that is driving the <br>
Christian Science church into schism even as we speak.  $40 million or so<br>
will go to the church if they publish this book and promote it in all <br>
their reading rooms.  Problem is, the book effectively says that Mary Baker<br>
Eddy was divine, which most Christian Scientists don't believe.  If they <br>
don't promote the book, the money goes to Stanford.  The leadership decided<br>
to publish the book, because their television efforts have left them strapped<br>
for cash.  But there is a lawsuit going on claiming that the church is not <br>
promoting the book vigorously enough and thus the conditions of the will <br>
are not met.<br>
<p>
So that could never happen here?  How soon we forget Dr. Davenport (who<br>
didn't even have any preconditions.)  If we were to ask church leaders<br>
in <br>
the SDA church, I'm sure they would say with one voice that they are forced<br>
to pay much more attention to fiscal woes than they would like.  (Leaders<br>
are welcome to respond.)  Vigilance in financial matters is well worth<br>
the time to discuss.<br>

IT HAS RECENTLY BECOME APPARENT THAT SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT USING THE CAPS <br>
LOCK KEY IS THE COMPUTER EQUIVALENT OF SHOUTING.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY<br>
TRUE WHEN CHARACTERIZING THE OTHER PERSON'S VIEWPOINT.  THE PROBLEM WITH <br>
THIS IS THAT CAPSLOCKING IS BECOMING COMMON ENOUGH THAT IT IS LOSING ITS <br>
EFFECT.  FOR INSTANCE, YOU CAN'T TELL WHETHER I'M CAPSLOCKING TO DRIVE<br>
HOME A POINT OR WHETHER MY CAPS LOCK IS STUCK ON.<br>
<p>
SO FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE TRENCHES, I OFFER NEW POINTS OF EMPHASIS:<br>
_UNDERLINE_  (GREAT WAY TO MAKE A WORD STAND OUT)<br>
****ASTERISKS****   (ALSO COMMON NET EMPHASIS)<br>
lowercase!   THIS REVERSE-PSYCHOLOGY TECHNIQUE GIVES EMPHASIS DUE TO    <br>
                SURPRISE.<br>
OR YOU CAN USE REGULAR PUNCTUATION SUCH AS !!!!! AND ?????<br>
<p>
However, I would like to see more smileys  :-) than any of these.<br>
The discussion particularly on what is sin and what are we like, etc,<br>
is a discussion that could benefit from some inquisitive questioning<br>
and attempting to understand the other position.  I've been trying to <br>
do that but the crossfire is too high right now.  The one point of agreement<br>
we have established so far is that each side thinks the other is wrong.<br>
There's a real theological difference trying to get out here, but it's mired<br>
in terminology on both sides.  <br>
<p>
I heard someone accused of "exegesis" recently.  I thought this was a good <br>
thing to do.  The idea of exegesis as I understand it is to study the Bible<br>
to try to extract the meanings from the verse, rather than coming to the <br>
Bible with a preconceived idea and gathering ammunition to support it.<br>
<p>
Let's try to be people of the Book, and let it speak to us, rather<br>
than presuming to speak for it.<br>
<p>
We now return you to the regularly scheduled war coverage.<br>

Hey all you netters, I got a good one for you.  Walla Walla College is<br>
presently having a rather large debate on whether there should be any<br>
monitoring and possible deletion of news groups such as alt.sex and<br>
other similar groups.  I think this is going to become a greater issue<br>
as more SDA colleges are connected to Internet and I'm curious on what<br>
you have to say.<br>
<p>
As far as I know, the debate at WWC is presently confined to a forum<br>
called RNS, but I think it will spred.  At present, it appears that<br>
the forum members are about evenly divided between those that think<br>
policing the news groups is wrong and those who think it is the<br>
morally the right thing to do.<br>
<p>
A sampling of reasons why those who think it is wrong to police follow:<br>
1. It is a form of thought control.<br>
2. Where does the line get drawn on?  If you police one group, should<br>
   you police them all?<br>
3. It is not a part of WWC but rather a window to the rest of the<br>
   world and thus should not fall under the rules and regulations of<br>
   WWC.<br>
4. The students should be old enough to makethe decision for themselves<br>
   on whether to read the garbage or not.  Give them a chance to use<br>
   what they have hopefully learned while growing up.<br>
etc.<br>
<p>
A sampling of the reasons why the news groups should be policed is:<br>
1. It is a service provided by WWC and, in various shades, is at odds with<br>
   WWC's believes and reason for existence.<br>
2. What happens when a parent finds out that their child has access to<br>
   the kind of junk that can be found in news through WWC.<br>
3. It's morally wrong, so we shouldn't support it.<br>
etc.<br>
<p>
I believe Andrews subscribes to news.  If so, has this ever been an issue<br>
there?  If it was, how was it dealt with?<br>

Well now I know why our organists love that modulation for the last verse<br>
of the hymns. The only problem is, our organist tends to also play a different<br>
harmonic arrangement for the last verse. This leaves me in a vile predicament.<br>
I can't sing high enough to modulate up a note, and I can't sing the bass part<br>
because it has been significantly altered! I love the modulations and also<br>
the innovative arrangements, but I also like to sing the hymns.<br>
<p>
So to all your organists out there - if you are planning to change key then<br>
please START LOWER!!! Otherwise I can see I will need to invest in some new<br>
pants for church, a couple of sizes smaller.  :-O<br>
<p>
Before I conclude, let me express my thanks to all those who share their<br>
talents in worship. Especially musicians, I particularly appreciate your<br>
contributions.<br>
<p>
btw, I take it I should have said "potted plants"? What do you guys call<br>
plants in pots??<br>

In an attempt to start a new thread...<br>
<p>
I have a work mate who in non-SDA but a very sincere conservative Christian.  I<br>
respect his opinion alot.  We were talking the other day about what the "will of<br>
God" is.  He spoke of an "individual will" and the "moral will" of God.  He also<br>
strongly stated that there is no Biblical evidence for such a thing he calls the<br>
individual will of God and therefore does not believe in it.  To define what he<br>
meant by individual will, he describes it as being a specific will for each and<br>
every individual on earth as opposed to the moral will of God given to all mankind<br>
in the Bible.<br>
<p>
What this boils down to is that God does not have a specific list of things for<br>
each one of us to do...marry so-in-so, go into occupation x, work for company y<br>
for 5 years then go to company z, you can buy a two door refrigorator but not<br>
till 1995 when you can afford it, etc.  His reasoning includes the question, <br>
where would you draw the line?  Does God care what color socks I put on in the<br>
morning?  What car I drive to work?  Whether I drink lemonade or orage juice?<br>
Does He care about such "trivia"?  He also asks, if there is a specific will of<br>
God for each person, how do we find out what it is?  It would be to admit that<br>
God has a hidden aggenda for each of us.  <br>
<p>
But yet I have grown up with the idea being ingrained in me that we pray to <br>
God for His will for each major decision we make...who we marry, what profession,<br>
etc.  My friend believes that yes, God as a moral will for all mankind to follow<br>
that includes guidelines for everyday living but they apply to all and is not<br>
specific to any individual over another.  What applies to me applies to you.<br>
This would include guidelines on how we spend our money, how and what we eat, etc.<br>
<p>
What do you all think about this??  If you know of Biblical evidence that<br>
supports the concept of an "individual will" of God, please let me know.  I would<br>
also be interested in EGW references but I don't think they would have any <br>
weight with my friend since he is non-SDA.<br>

Just thought I would inform you on SDA net about a news event taking place here<br>
in Portland, OR (USA).  John Gunter, a member of an Assemblies of God church <br>
here in the metro area has risen up and making know via a 3 page letter he wrote<br>
a series of events that have taken place independent of each other over the past<br>
few months that indicate to him that God is planning to reign judgement on this<br>
city on May 3, 1993 in the form of a very strong earthquake.  He claims that the<br>
city is a very strong if not the strongest center for Satanism in the country<br>
and that God has indicated to him and others he has spoken with that God is going<br>
to punish the city by destroying it.  He sent this letter to 1080 churches in the<br>
Portland/Vancouver (WA) area.  It has gotten radio and TV coverage.<br>
<p>
At first this sounds far fetched.  But it has ALOT of people in the area taking<br>
this seriously.  We had a moderate quake of 5.7 on the scale on March 25.  He<br>
states that he had been impressed that God is going to punish the city and is<br>
going to give 40 days of warning, just like Ninevah. But he didn't know when the<br>
40 days were going to start.  Then when the March 25 quake hit, he ran to his<br>
calendar and counted...May 3 came up.  This matched identically with what another<br>
Christian pastor (a Russian)who had someone he knew in his congregation that <br>
claims to have been told by God that May 3 a powerful earthquake would strike<br>
Portland on May 3 and destroy downtown and the west hills (housing area on the <br>
west side of downtown).<br>
<p>
What is spooky is that geologists are predicting the same thing to happen (a very<br>
powerful earthquake) to hit Portland soon (between tomorrow and 100 years is the<br>
official date range) but when asked what they personally think off the camera,<br>
they say they have been told to not tell by the CIA for fear of causing panic.<br>
<p>
I could go on with details but just wanted to see what others thought.  How do<br>
you know if this message is really from God?  Would God give a warning message<br>
like this to a non-SDA?  Why not?  SDA's tend to sit on their seats when it <br>
comes to stuff like this.  He may have chosen someone who he knew would get the<br>
word out.<br>
<p>
As a side note, a friend of mine in Seattle mentioned recently that he read that<br>
a chinease prophet has predicted a major catastrophe to hit the Pacific NW of <br>
US the first week of May.  And yet another person my wife works with said he saw<br>
a psychic prediction at a new years party that stated that a major catastrophe<br>
would strike the pacific NW the first week of May and the stock market would <br>
crash shortly afterwards.<br>
<p>
Are we living in the last days or what??<br>
I don't know if this is true or not but I quess we will all know May 3.  I would<br>
like to ask...IF it does happen where did the message come from? (God or Satan)<br>
<p>

I would like to comment on several areas that have been discussed on<br>
the net recently.<br>
<p>
1.  Plants and Music<br>
<p>
  Thankyou to all those who replied to my query on this topic both on<br>
  the net and privately. Your replies confirmed my thoughts that the<br>
  research was fairly shallow. Just because a research paper/news item/<br>
  argument etc supports our particular view does not make it a good<br>
  argument.<br>
<p>
2. Meat and Vegetarianism etc<br>
<p>
  Once again we need to be careful about accepting arguments because they<br>
  support our point of view. The arguments that meat is unhealthy because<br>
  of pollution and disease applies at leat in part to plants as well.<br>
<p>
  I heard a doctor of tropical medicine say that you should not eat salad<br>
  vegetables in tropical areas because they are uncooked and carry all<br>
  sorts of diseases we humans are susceptible to. Yet no one would deny<br>
  that nutritionally, salads are good for you.<br>
<p>
  Our health message is surely to eat the best that is available at the time.<br>
<p>
  I think that sometimes we make great issues about small instances. The<br>
  recent mail item that listed several senarios about eating is a case in<br>
  point. In most of those situations I would do the best I could without<br>
  giving offense. (even if it meant eating shellfish or ham) I am a vegetarian<br>
  by lifestyle. I do not believe that eating a particular item of food is a<br>
  sin. The number of times I find myself in difficult situations<br>
  are quite rare. I would rather stand before the judgement bar of God to<br>
  justify the eating of a mouthful of pork, than have to justify the offense<br>
  I gave to someone who would have been in the kingdom of God had it not<br>
  been for my insistence that I will never eat ham.<br>
<p>
3. The Nature of Christ and Sin etc<br>
<p>
  The recent discussion on the nature of Christ and our own sinful natures<br>
  has been very interesting from my point of view. (some of the mail items<br>
  were too long to read at one sitting and I hope that some correspondents<br>
  learn quickly how to do a precis  - I only get to read my mail about<br>
  twice a week)<br>
<p>
  I grew up during a period of time when these issues were being discussed<br>
  vigorously here in Australia and NZ. I saw the bitterness of the argument.<br>
  People left the church because of it. Others refused to join for the same<br>
  reason. What is more, when I started to read about history, I found that<br>
  the same arguments have been going on since the time of Christ Himself.<br>
<p>
  I am concerned that we let the mechanistic side of salvation make such<br>
  a major impact on our relationship with one another. If we spent as<br>
  much or more time dwelling on the fact that salvation is offered<br>
  freely to all by the blood of Christ, we would be able to discuss<br>
  the nature of Christ without coming to blows.<br>
<p>
4. Music - Stars in Crown - Dancing etc<br>
<p>
  I like Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, a Catholic Mass. I have read the words<br>
  translated from Latin. I agree with most of them. I enjoy the "Credo" -<br>
  I believe in the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Is there any hope for<br>
  me or do I stand condemned for listening to Papal music?<br>
<p>
PS How do some of you find the time to write so much and do your work/study/<br>
research at the same time? Maybe you don't have families.<br>

OK  :^)))<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The one point of agreement</i><br>
<i>&gt; we have established so far is that each side thinks the other is wrong.</i><br>
<p>
at least were making progress !<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I heard someone accused of "exegesis" recently.  I thought this was a good </i><br>
<i>&gt; thing to do.  The idea of exegesis as I understand it is to study the Bible</i><br>
<i>&gt; to try to extract the meanings from the verse, rather than coming to the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Bible with a preconceived idea and gathering ammunition to support it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
It is a good thing, you must have misread my statement, I said :<br>
<p>
"this verse only says that he was born in a sinful environment.That is exegesis"<br>
<p>
What this means is that the preceeding statement was exegesis, it was not used<br>
in a negative manner at all.<br>
<p>

Hi Noe and all<br>
<p>
I'm not soft on sin ! Sin in my books is worse that for those who believe<br>
guilt is inhereted because there is no one else to blame for it but ourselves.<br>
In the other view sin is God's fault because He is the one that originally<br>
fixed it so that you could do anything about it. The magnitude of the <br>
sin problem remains the same either way its only the responisbility<br>
for it that is shifted.<br>
<p>
I'm certain of the honesty of those who believe differently from the<br>
way I do and do not question their honesty for a moment. <br>
<p>
If I have done wrong by filling the mailboxes of every SDAnet member<br>
with pages of arguments I'm sorry but I was only replying to issues<br>
which you brought up. You brought up a lot of issues and as you know <br>
it always takes less words to assert something than to analyse the assertions.<br>
<p>
I would like to ask, since we are now in the process of mapping out<br>
all the human genes, which gene would you like to propose as the "guilt"<br>
gene ? Does such a thing exist ? If so then genetic engineering is the<br>
greatest saviour of man/woman kind because we will be able to edit out <br>
the "guilt" gene from our gene sequences and therefore attain sinlessness !!!<br>
<p>
[ Good one hey ?:^)) ]<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; FIRST PARENTS.  Yes, we were present there, and we deserved to die as much</i><br>
<i>&gt; as Adam &amp; Eve did.  You complain about God not being fair in attributing</i><br>
<i>&gt; guilt to Adam and Eve's progeny -- to me, that argument just doesn't fly. </i><br>
<p>
But the bible clearly teaches in those 'volumous' articles that<br>
I posted, The child will not die for the sin of the father !!!<br>
<p>
Are you implying that God doesn't really mean that  ?<br>
<p>
What about when Jesus clearly teaches that there is no sin where there<br>
is no knowledge ?<br>
<p>
<p>
God would not be fair in arbitrarily condemning all the death and then<br>
giving us away out if we would like to chose it. That would be akin<br>
to a cat playing with a mouse. God doesn't play with us in that way.<br>
<p>
We both agree that salvation is only through the grace of Christ and <br>
that our works can not and do not atone for our sin in any way. The emphasis<br>
is surely Christ's work in us, "Christ in you hte hope of glory" Col 1:27 (?)<br>
<p>
Our role as you say is more than just accepting, its striving in all things<br>
to glorify God. "Present your selves a living sacrifice" "Be ye transformed"<br>
Salvation is not a passive experience, its an active one, Paul says its a<br>
warfare in which we should strive even unto death. EGW says that the battle<br>
over self is the hardest battle which must be fought and won, nothing about<br>
lounging around.<br>
<p>
Yes Christ does get all the glory because we wouldn't even aspire to<br>
the divine nature if it wasn't for what Christ has done, is doing and will<br>
do for us. Any effort required on our part is useless, like ropes of sand<br>
without the empowering grace of Christ. The effort on our part is to<br>
choose, that all we can do we have no other recourse, the battle is to<br>
choose not to sin, to chose to glorify God in all things. God's strenght makes<br>
our choosing a reality.<br>
<p>
<p>

      Original Sin...<br>
<p>
I have read some arguments for and positions on original sin.  It<br>
seems that there is no way changes of opinions will occur.  Is anyone<br>
listening to anyone else?  I certainly appreciate the discussion.<br>
Has anyone read some of the arguments published in "Our Firm<br>
Foundation?  Unforyunately, I,m new to the net so I don't know how<br>
this conversation began.<br>
<p>
Personally, I do not believe that accepting either view affects my<br>
relationship with God, though it will undoubtedly affect the concept<br>
of salvation.  I do believe however, that those who try<br>
to enforce their rigid ideas on this controversial topic on others as<br>
a test of salvation (as many are wont to do) will not only be a<br>
stumbling block to some, but also place undue burdens on themselves.<br>
<p>
That's all folks!<br>
<p>

I am a student at WWC and I think that Internet shouldn't be policed.  If <br>
they start with alt.sex, will they later decide to ban alt.vampyres or <br>
alt.pagan, too.  I admit some of it is morally incorrect, but I figure <br>
we're old enough now to make decisions on what we read.<br>
I also think that some of the newsgroups allow us to learn about the <br>
views of others(example: alt.atheism, or will that one be next on the <br>
chopping block.)<br>

Ruben Gonzalez says:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm not soft on sin ! Sin in my books is worse that for those who believe</i><br>
<i>&gt;guilt is inhereted because there is no one else to blame for it but ourselves.</i><br>
<p>
How can we blame Adam &amp; Eve for the disease to which they exposed us, when<br>
Christ has given us the antidote?  That's what Paul is saying in Romans:<br>
we had no choice in the death sentence (and guilt) conferred upon us due<br>
to Adam's transgression, and we had no choice or part in Christ's<br>
Atonement, which sets us free of that guilt and death.<br>
<p>
Ruben's argument, if I understand it correctly, is that no guilt or sin<br>
passes to us from the transgression at Eden -- only the "sinful nature"<br>
(meaning, presumably, the effects of centuries of sin on the human<br>
organism).   We begin life with a "blank slate" and actually<br>
***could*** bypass Christ's Atonement and accomplish our own salvation<br>
if we tap into enough "power" (whatever that is).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In the other view sin is God's fault because He is the one that originally</i><br>
<i>&gt;fixed it so that you could do anything about it.</i><br>
<p>
Ruben is being so tricky!  I never once would even suggest that God was at<br>
fault.  This is Satan's argument.  The Bible is clear as to who the<br>
originator of sin was, and actually, Ruben's argument would accuse God<br>
of not providing enough ***power*** to allow Adam and Eve to overcome<br>
sin.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm certain of the honesty of those who believe differently from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;way I do and do not question their honesty for a moment.</i><br>
<p>
Sounds patronizing in view of the zeal with which Ruben attacks "those who<br>
believe differently."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;as you know it always takes less words to assert something than to analyse</i><br>
<i>&gt;the assertions.</i><br>
<p>
Not necessarily -- unless you are straining so badly to prove marginal<br>
points....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...we are now in the process of mapping out all the human genes, which gene</i><br>
<i>&gt; would you like to propose as the "guilt" gene ?</i><br>
<p>
Despite Ruben's attempt to belittle this point, let's keep<br>
in mind that, if we are all descended from Adam and Eve, as Scripture<br>
reveals, our genetic material was present there in Eden and, by<br>
extension, so were we.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But the bible clearly teaches in those 'volumous' articles that</i><br>
<i>&gt;I posted, The child will not die for the sin of the father !!!</i><br>
<p>
The child will not die for sins committed by the father in knowing and<br>
willful rebellion against God.  Those kinds of sins are not what this<br>
whole discussion is about.  We're talking about ***original*** sin.  This is<br>
the guilt condition that transcends our will and our actions.  This is<br>
the condition we are in until we accept Jesus Christ as our Savior, who,<br>
as our Second Adam, lifts that guilt from us.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What about when Jesus clearly teaches that there is no sin where there</i><br>
<i>&gt;is no knowledge ?</i><br>
<p>
There is no knowing, willful rebellion against God when there is no<br>
knowledge of God -- but there remains the original sin.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;God would not be fair in arbitrarily condemning all the death and then</i><br>
<i>&gt;giving us away out if we would like to chose it.</i><br>
<p>
God had no part in the transgression of our first parents.  You should<br>
be careful in how you state that.  There was nothing arbitrary about it.<br>
He gave Adam and Eve every possible warning, but the bottom line was<br>
that "in the day that thou eatest the fruit thereof, thou shalt surely<br>
die."  Adam, the legal father of our race, in choosing rebellion against<br>
God, passed down the effects of that rebellion to all his progeny.  We<br>
are not each born as new Adams and Eves to be tested all over again.<br>
The test ***failed***.  It wasn't God's fault; it was our's.  Ruben<br>
doesn't seem to see this point.<br>
<p>
Now Christ has paid the price of Adam's trangression, and by accepting<br>
Him as our personal Savior, we are freed of the penalty due us from<br>
Adam's fall.  But Christ does much more for us.   He doesn't ransom us<br>
from the fall just to allow us to go on sinning.  By faith we becoming<br>
attached to Him and seek to do His will.  We draw strength from Him,<br>
through His Word and through His Spirit, which will protect us from sin<br>
and temptation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ... [our] battle is to choose not to sin....</i><br>
<p>
No, that battle was won by Christ nearly 2,000 years ago.  Our battle is<br>
to choose Jesus Christ day-by-day, moment-by-moment -- to love Him and<br>
serve Him and be faithful to Him.  That is to be the peak of our<br>
experience.  That is to be our drive and motivation.  The obedience that<br>
flows from such an experience is the only kind of obedience that is acceptible<br>
to God.  If we are striving to choose not to sin, we are rendering the sullen<br>
submission of a rebel.<br>
<p>
CLOSING NOTE TO MY FRIEND RUBEN: Ruben, although sometimes our words<br>
seem to carry anger, I hope you understand that I write what I write<br>
from my heart -- and that I do appreciate you and your well-considered<br>
responses to my posts.  I feel we can disagree on these issues and still<br>
serve our Lord Jesus in the ways He has in mind for us.  Discussion to<br>
me is enlightening, and I don't really mean to be as sour as some of my<br>
posts may occassionally appear to be.<br>
<p>
NOE@TENET.EDU<br>
With apologies to Steve for the occassional use of CAPS.<br>

Perhaps the most interesting description of heaven I have heard in song<br>
is found in the fourth symphony of Mahler, the last movement,<br>
"Wir geneissen die Himmlischen Freuden... or something like that<br>
It's properly sung by a boy soprano and is a description of a child's view<br>
of heaven.  <br>
<p>
Various imaginations in the song include St. Luke as the keeper of livestock<br>
and St. Martha as the heavenly cook, and this is just the beginning.  <br>
Intriguing concepts (though not Historically Correct to be sure).  And<br>
it's a beautiful piece of music as well.<br>
<p>
Now blending the description of heaven with the question on God's will:<br>
It's one of the most true truths I know that God answers prayer.  So would<br>
urgent prayer for the Second Coming hasten that event or not?  Can prayer<br>
change the will of God?  Some examples in the Bible would indicate yes.<br>
(Moses' intercession for Israel).<br>

<p>
I would first say that I do not fully understand Ruben's position, but I <br>
believe it is close to mine.  I would not presume to speak for Ruben, so<br>
I will speak for my understanding.  I realize it was not asked for.<br>
<p>
The "power" comes from the life and death of Christ.  If we are separated<br>
from Christ, we are separated from the "power" which makes it impossible<br>
to keep from sinning.  It is not a true statement to say that the "power"<br>
is separate from Christ's Atonement.  It is because of the full ministry,<br>
of Christ that we are able to have such power.  Therefore we could not<br>
access the power without the ministy of Christ.  So it is not possible to <br>
bypass Christ's Atonement and tap into the power for Christs life, death,<br>
and ministry in the sanctuary above makes the power available.<br>
<p>
I understand Noe's fear of the word "power"  It could mean anything.  I<br>
agree we should define our terms.  I have used the term so I will now try<br>
to define what I mean by it.  Once again this is SHerman talking not Ruben.<br>
I believe the power to be Christ in us.  As Paul said, "I am crucified with<br>
Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me."  Gal 2:20.<br>
This is imparted righteousness.  Once again, I would stress that it is not<br>
fair to say we could accomplish our own salvation by tapping into the power,<br>
the power is only available because of Christ.<br>
<p>
I should not have used fear in the above paragraph, perhaps discomfort.<br>
<p>
I believe we should look at what we all mean by salvation.  I wonder if we<br>
are using it to mean exactly the same thing.<br>

are correct, Jesus has proven that a day by day hour-by-hour connection with<br>
God can keep you from sin.  It is interesting that the only way the law<br>
can be understood and kept is coming from a love for God.  With Jesus all<br>
things are possible.  Apart from Christ we will sin and sin and sin, for<br>
we do not have the strength.<br>

<i>&gt; sin.</i><br>
<p>
No We would accuse Adam and Eve for letting go of the power.  I don't care<br>
how much poer you have it you let go of the source you have nothing.  Adam<br>
and Eve let go of the source which is God.  Today when I sin, it is because<br>
I let go of the power that God has made available to me, for He is able to<br>
keep me from falling.  Jude 24.  Also as Gal 2:17-19 says if I fall back into<br>
my old life of sin, blame me don't blame God.  Forgive me for my very loose<br>
paraphrase.<br>

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The child will not die for sins committed by the father in knowing and</i><br>
<i>&gt; willful rebellion against God.  Those kinds of sins are not what this</i><br>
<i>&gt; whole discussion is about.  We're talking about ***original*** sin.  This is</i><br>
<p>
Wasn't Adam our father.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the guilt condition that transcends our will and our actions.  This is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the condition we are in until we accept Jesus Christ as our Savior, who,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as our Second Adam, lifts that guilt from us.</i><br>
<p>
Yes this is the question we are discussing.  Is their a guilt condition that<br>
transcends our will and actions.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;What about when Jesus clearly teaches that there is no sin where there</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is no knowledge ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is no knowing, willful rebellion against God when there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge of God -- but there remains the original sin.</i><br>
<p>
That is the question.  Is their an original sin that remains?  This gives<br>
me another question.  If Christ forgives us of original sin, can we ever lose<br>
this forgiveness?  This question probably was not clear.<br>
<p>
Can we lose our forgiveness of original sin like we can lose our forgiveness of<br>
sin due to our willfull acts?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; God had no part in the transgression of our first parents.  You should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be careful in how you state that.  There was nothing arbitrary about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; He gave Adam and Eve every possible warning, but the bottom line was</i><br>
<p>
What was our part in the transgression of the first parents?<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now Christ has paid the price of Adam's trangression, and by accepting</i><br>
<i>&gt; Him as our personal Savior, we are freed of the penalty due us from</i><br>
<i>&gt; Adam's fall.  But Christ does much more for us.   He doesn't ransom us</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the fall just to allow us to go on sinning.  By faith we becoming</i><br>
<i>&gt; attached to Him and seek to do His will.  We draw strength from Him,</i><br>
<i>&gt; through His Word and through His Spirit, which will protect us from sin</i><br>
<i>&gt; and temptation.</i><br>
<p>
Just change Adam to Sherman and the whole paragraph sounds good to me. 8-)<br>
you state we draw strenght form Christ.  That strenth is the "power" I talk<br>
about.  You see it cannot be separated from Christ or his atonement, or<br>
his ministry in Heaven, or The Holy Ghost.<br>

<i>&gt; It's one of the most true truths I know that God answers prayer.  So would</i><br>
<i>&gt; urgent prayer for the Second Coming hasten that event or not?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Steve Timm</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Steve:<br>
<p>
Since God only knows (literally) when the Second Advent will happen,<br>
it's an open question as to whether it will get here any sooner by<br>
praying for it.  We're instructed in the Lord's Prayer to ask that God's<br>
Kingdom might come, with no indication that we're hustling it along.<br>
<p>
More interesting to me is the possibility that some who may wish to<br>
hasten the Second Advent might not be too thrilled by the results.  I'm<br>
thinking of the "Lord, Lord" crowd to whom Jesus says "I never knew<br>
you."  Like the spiritual says, "Everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven ain't<br>
goin' there."  A clear case of: Be careful what you pray for, you just<br>
might get it.<br>

In response to the newsgroup "censorship" issue:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hey all you netters, I got a good one for you.  Walla Walla College is</i><br>
<i>&gt; presently having a rather large debate on whether there should be any</i><br>
<i>&gt; monitoring and possible deletion of news groups such as alt.sex and</i><br>
<i>&gt; other similar groups.  I think this is going to become a greater issue</i><br>
<i>&gt; as more SDA colleges are connected to Internet and I'm curious on what</i><br>
<i>&gt; you have to say.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As far as I know, the debate at WWC is presently confined to a forum</i><br>
<i>&gt; called RNS, but I think it will spred.  At present, it appears that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the forum members are about evenly divided between those that think</i><br>
<i>&gt; policing the news groups is wrong and those who think it is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; morally the right thing to do.</i><br>
<p>
Well, yes, Andrews does subsribe to news.  But we do not subscribe to<br>
all the news groups.  Probably I can express my feelings by an analogy.<br>
Just because the campus bookstore provides lots of magazines for<br>
purchase does not mean it provides all possible magazines available.<br>
Our bookstore provides things like Popular Photography, etc., but it<br>
does not provide Playboy, etc.  We do not feel that this is censorship<br>
or "thought control", we as an institution simply feel that these types<br>
of magazines do not represent what the Adventist Church stands for.<br>
Clearly if someone wants these magazines they can get them elsewhere.<br>
<p>
The same is true for news.  We do not subscribe to the alt newsgroups,<br>
yet they _can_ be obtained (by persistent users) from other places.<br>
Hopefully we are teaching our students how to evaluate and develop<br>
strong moral and ethical ideals and they will _choose_ quality<br>
publications and newsgroups to read.<br>

Look at it this way folks...however you define evil, sin and guilt, Christ<br>
can save us from all three. Does it matter which _we_ classify as which,<br>
when _He_ deals with them all?<br>
<p>
Oh but that's right, that takes us back to the _when_ argument, doesn't it.<br>
<p>
:-(<br>
<p>
I suppose that's where faith comes in! We can only do our best and trust Him<br>
to get the timing right.<br>

I grew up in California.  We had so many people making predictions like this<br>
that I just ignore them.  What is actually surprising is that there are so many<br>
earthquakes in California that it is hard to be wrong when predicting that<br>
there will be one.  If I were to tell you that there will be an earthquake<br>
between May 16 and June 12 in California I would probably be right.  In fact<br>
there will probably be several.  Given this the track record of the predictors<br>
is very poor.  They tend to be wrong more often then I would expect, mostly<br>
from trying to give an exact time.<br>

Ah, what fun.<br>
What do you mean by "specific"?  Your socks and car questions?<br>
<p>
What do you mean by "the will of God"?  Exact or general, that is,<br>
a precise answer to every question, or a bringing of my will into<br>
harmony with His principles?  <br>
<p>
I find that on those occasions when I'm nearest to the latter idea<br>
and ask God, "What would you have me do?"  He usually reponds with,<br>
"What did you have in mind?"  Indeed, if my will is in harmony with<br>
His, then whatever I have in mind may be a quite satisfactory answer<br>
to the question.<br>
<p>
That's a rather short and practical response without "proof texts."<br>

Steve's questions about what would you do in various eating situations<br>
rang true for me!  I've been in nearly everyone of those, except the<br>
European setting.  Our Chinese grad student friends were aware of our<br>
vegetarian lifestyle when they invited us to dinner.  One set of friends<br>
had dried shrimp in everything, because to them it is not meat.  WE<br>
(oops, didn't mean to cap that) picked it out discretely.  The other<br>
set didn't have anything so obvious, but when I inquired about the<br>
wonderful dipping sauce (after dinner), they showed me a bottle of<br>
oyster sauce that was a key ingredient!  Oh well...  For me this is<br>
not a salvific issue at all, and I would rather drink oyster sauce by<br>
the cupful rather than offend my friends.  However, I might have<br>
explained our lifestyle further if they had invited us again, thus<br>
heading off the problem a third time.<br>

<i>&gt; Ruben's argument, if I understand it correctly, is that no guilt or sin</i><br>
<i>&gt; passes to us from the transgression at Eden -- only the "sinful nature"</i><br>
<i>&gt; (meaning, presumably, the effects of centuries of sin on the human</i><br>
<i>&gt; organism).   We begin life with a "blank slate" and actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; ***could*** bypass Christ's Atonement and accomplish our own salvation</i><br>
<i>&gt; if we tap into enough "power" (whatever that is).</i><br>
<p>
_*_NO_*_ !! :)<br>
<p>
We are powerless to overcome sin, only with Christ imparted grace can<br>
we ever overcome. That power is what John tells us when he says "He gave them<br>
power to be sons of God, even to those who believe in his name." John 1 <br>
also Paul tells us that we should "know Him and the power of his resurrection."<br>
Are we not aquainted with God's power ?<br>
So we can not "accomplish our own salvation, whatever way you look at it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ruben is being so tricky!  I never once would even suggest that God was at</i><br>
<i>&gt; fault.  This is Satan's argument.  The Bible is clear as to who the</i><br>
<i>&gt; originator of sin was, and actually, Ruben's argument would accuse God</i><br>
<i>&gt; of not providing enough ***power*** to allow Adam and Eve to overcome</i><br>
<i>&gt; sin.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I know you didn't but that is the conclusion I must come to, because <br>
in that view He created me already a sinner, guilty of sin, and <br>
reasoning in a systematic (theological) manner unable to ever overcome sin.<br>
<p>
Thus (and EGW says so) the blame sin must fall on God.<br>
"Exact obedience is required and those that say that it is not possible<br>
to live a perfect life throw upon God the imputation of injustice and<br>
untruth." Ms 147; RH Feb7, 1957<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I'm certain of the honesty of those who believe differently from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;way I do and do not question their honesty for a moment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sounds patronizing in view of the zeal with which Ruben attacks "those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe differently."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Thanks Noe, but I didn't mean to be patronizing in the slightest, I was just<br>
stating my respect for your conclusions. <br>
<p>
I hope (and don't believe) that I have ever attacked you personally once<br>
in this entire discussion, so I don't believe the above statement is acurate.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;as you know it always takes less words to assert something than to analyse</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the assertions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Not necessarily -- unless you are straining so badly to prove marginal</i><br>
<i>&gt;points....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Marginal ? straining ? nah, they were dead simple, its just that overwelming<br>
evidence takes more space to present than single assertions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;....</i><br>
<i>&gt; Despite Ruben's attempt to belittle this point, let's keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; in mind that, if we are all descended from Adam and Eve, as Scripture</i><br>
<i>&gt; reveals, our genetic material was present there in Eden and, by</i><br>
<i>&gt; extension, so were we.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Yes the dust  (raw chemical material) did exist, But I didn't, saying<br>
otherwise is getting to close to saying that we prexist our births which<br>
is getting too close to the immortality of the soul for my liking.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; The child will not die for sins committed by the father in knowing and</i><br>
<i>&gt; willful rebellion against God.  Those kinds of sins are not what this</i><br>
<i>&gt; whole discussion is about.  We're talking about ***original*** sin.  This is</i><br>
<p>
It is exactly the same principle if Adam, our father's sin holds then so<br>
does our immediate father's sin. God does not change the rules.<br>
This dicotemy you present of original sin verses normal sin is artificial<br>
and again extrabiblical.. and dare I say it Augustinian in origin, not<br>
a man I would put much trust in.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;What about when Jesus clearly teaches that there is no sin where there</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is no knowledge ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is no knowing, willful rebellion against God when there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge of God -- but there remains the original sin.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
The bible doesn't say that anywhere. As such this idea is extra-biblical,<br>
and not something I would build my faith on.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;God would not be fair in arbitrarily condemning all the death and then</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;giving us away out if we would like to chose it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; God had no part in the transgression of our first parents.  You should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be careful in how you state that.  There was nothing arbitrary about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; He gave Adam and Eve every possible warning, but the bottom line was</i><br>
<i>&gt; that "in the day that thou eatest the fruit thereof, thou shalt surely</i><br>
<i>&gt; die."  Adam, the legal father of our race, in choosing rebellion against</i><br>
<i>&gt; God, passed down the effects of that rebellion to all his progeny.  We</i><br>
<i>&gt; are not each born as new Adams and Eves to be tested all over again.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The test ***failed***.  It wasn't God's fault; it was our's.  Ruben</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't seem to see this point.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
It isn't my fault at all, I wasn't there and had no say whatsoever.<br>
God does not blame me for something I didn't. That is unjust and contrary<br>
to God's nature!  Niether did I say that God was the cause of Adam's <br>
transgression, but the doctrine of original sin leads to the concept<br>
that sin is unavoidable and therefore God is responsible for our sin.<br>
see EGW's quote above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ... [our] battle is to choose not to sin....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, that battle was won by Christ nearly 2,000 years ago.  Our battle is</i><br>
<i>&gt; to choose Jesus Christ day-by-day, moment-by-moment -- to love Him and</i><br>
<i>&gt; serve Him and be faithful to Him.  That is to be the peak of our</i><br>
<p>
Same thing, you either choose Christ or sin, you can't have both<br>
unless you are part of the harlot Babylon who want's to unite in fornication<br>
the holy and the profane.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; CLOSING NOTE TO MY FRIEND RUBEN: Ruben, although sometimes our words</i><br>
<i>&gt; seem to carry anger, I hope you understand that I write what I write</i><br>
<i>&gt; from my heart -- and that I do appreciate you and your well-considered</i><br>
<i>&gt;....</i><br>
<p>
As I have privately mentioned, and tried to explain in my last post (see above)<br>
I appreciate your responses. I hope that none of my replies have appeared<br>
to carry any anger, because there is none.<br>
<p>

Excerpts from an article on the front page of today's Chicago Tribune.<br>
By Thom Shanker of the Chicago Tribune<br>
<p>
"...The Seventh-day Adventists, with only a handful of adherents<br>
in all of the former Yugoslavia, already have delivered almost 80000<br>
letters and parcels across front lines and into beseiged enclaves,<br>
providing the only reliable link among loved ones in a land filled with<br>
hatred.<br>
<p>
The future of the mail service is in doubt since the Adventists' aid agency<br>
is just about broke.  Each convoy run costs $30000.  But thus far, nothing <br>
has stopped this mail run from getting through.<br>
<p>
"We have been successful because we are exclusively a humanitarian<br>
organization that is not violating any rules of delivering our aid," said<br>
Ratko Kuburic, secretary of the Adventist Development and Relief Agency<br>
(ADRA).<br>
<p>
"We get through because we are not helping just one nationality," he said.<br>
"We are helping everyone.  This is our biblical principle.  ...<br>
<p>
Since the first mail run last September, ADRA has taken 40000 letters<br>
and parcels into Sarajevo.  It also has brought another 38000 out to<br>
Belgrade for<br>
local delivery here or shipment to Croatia, still at war with its Serb <br>
minority, and to addresses in Europe and North America.<br>
<p>
On their first deliver the ADRA postal carriers drove around Sarajevo by<br>
themselves and got shot at by snipers, Kuburic said.  "There is no<br>
electricity in the apartment buildings, so no elevators.  They had to<br>
walk<br>
up 16 flights of stairs.<br>
<p>
ADRA now delivers mail to a central location in Sarajevo, and the names<br>
of recipients are cirulated on a computer printout for pickup.<br>
<p>
The refugee network has heard about ADRA--an estimated 2.5 million people<br>
have been displaced by the war--and the demand is so overwhelming that the <br>
aid agency had to turn down 150000 people who wanted packages delivered<br>
on Wednesday's mail run.  "Letters and medicine we never turn down,"<br>
Kuburic said, andno packages are accepted if they contain cigarettes, <br>
alcohol, coffee, or food items that spoil, like meat or cheese.  No postage<br>
is required.<br>

Everyone who joins the net receives a copy of the charter when he/she joins.<br>
But the charter has evolved quite a bit recently, and was recently approved<br>
in its revised version by the SDAnet board.  Those who have been on the net<br>
a long time will be amazed to see how much legalese has crept in over<br>
the years.<br>
<p>
Here it is<br>
<p>
<p>
SDAnet Charter:<br>
<p>
What SDAnet is:<br>
<p>
     SDAnet is a Seventh-day Adventist electronic discussion list.  <br>
     Messages are distributed around the world through electronic mail.  <br>
     All messages are approved by a moderator and are private in the sense <br>
     that they are sent only to those who subscribe. <br>
<p>
Purposes of SDAnet:<br>
<p>
     1)  To encourage contact between SDA's on various public campuses, <br>
     industry, and Adventist campuses.<br>
<p>
     2)  To supply information on what Seventh-day Adventists believe.<br>
     We have the SDA "Statement of Fundamental Beliefs" on line, and anyone<br>
     is welcome to ask questions or discuss what they mean.<br>
<p>
     3)  To discuss practical issues of relevance to the Adventist subculture<br>
     and the world in general.<br>
<p>
     4)  To allow for announcement of gatherings and conferences of interest<br>
     to the college and university community.<br>
<p>
     5)  To discuss issues in human relations.<br>
<p>
Legal Disclaimers:<br>
<p>
     This list is not an official arm of the Seventh-day Adventist church.<br>
     Steve Timm, the moderator, is a member of the church, but holds no  <br>
     position within the church and draws no salary from it.  <br>
<p>
     Some government and military sites restrict participation in private <br>
     mailing lists.  If you are in doubt you should check with your system <br>
     administrator to make sure it is all right.  SDAnet management assumes <br>
     no responsibility for illegal subscriptions.  SDAnet management reserves<br>
     the right to desubscribe people who persistently violate the charter.<br>
     SDAnet management attempts to prevent postings of confidential material<br>
     and illegal use of copyrighted material, but cannot assume responsibility<br>
     for ensuring that all posts sent by its members are legal and appropriate.<br>
     Responsibility for each post rests with the individual poster.<br>
<p>
     Opinions expressed on SDAnet do not necessarily reflect the opinions or <br>
     policies of the organizations that supply SDAnet with computer access.<br>
     Carnegie Mellon University is so undecided that its official colors<br>
     are plaid.  It has no opinions.<br>
<p>
Associated lists:<br>
<p>
     Posts from SDA-L, a fellowship and support list for Adventists in <br>
     the college community, are forwarded to SDAnet.  Enoch Hwang is <br>
     SDA-L listowner in charge of system management, and Steve Timm is in<br>
     charge of membership and subscriptions.  SDA-L posts sent to the SDAnet<br>
     address will be forwarded if they have SDA-L in the subject line.  SDA-L<br>
     is a LISTSERV-based list which can be subscribed to directly by sending <br>
     SUB SDA-L YOURNAME to LISTSERV@LLUVM.Bitnet    Attempts to post by non-<br>
     members to that list will be rejected.  SDA-L currently generates 3-10<br>
     messages per month.<br>
<p>
Moderatorial policies:<br>
<p>
     Opinions expressed on <br>
     this list will not necessarily reflect the official position of the SDA <br>
     church.  They should, however, reflect the Christian ideals of love and <br>
     courtesy.  Inflammatory comments will therefore be either heavily edited <br>
     or rejected.  Long articles should be broken into segments of 200 lines <br>
     or less.  SDAnet is not intended to duplicate the general discussion for <br>
     which specific public forums already exist, such as abortion or evolution.<br>
     SDAnet is not intended for advertising the sale of goods and services,<br>
     but members may notify the net of the availability of a product or service<br>
     and invite interested readers to obtain the details via electronic mail,<br>
     provided that the product is in keeping with the mission of SDAnet.<br>
  <br>
     A board of seven SDAnet members oversees the management of SDAnet.<br>
     They serve one-year terms beginning in February and October.  <br>
     At the beginning of each term the moderator will announce the number<br>
     of vacancies to be filled and those members interested in serving<br>
     will submit applications.  If more applications are received than<br>
     seats are available, the names will be submitted to the net for a vote,<br>
     with each net member casting votes for a number of persons equal <br>
     to the number of open seats.  If the previous chairperson is not <br>
     re-elected to the board, he or she shall stay on the board for another<br>
     year as an ex officio (non-voting) member.  The moderator is an<br>
     ex officio member of the board as well.  Vacancies during a board<br>
     term may be filled by the board, or by the moderator at the request<br>
     of the board.  If no volunteers exist for a board seat, the seat<br>
     shall be filled by choosing SDAnet members in order of decreasing<br>
     seniority on the net.  <br>
<p>
     Complaints concerning the conduct of the moderator should be directed<br>
     to the board members at sdanetboard@andrews.edu.<br>
     The board members can set moderatorial policy for SDAnet and <br>
     find a replacement or substitute moderator if the present moderator<br>
     becomes incapacitated or loses net access.  The board also serves<br>
     as advisors to the moderator on technological improvements to the net,<br>
     new and expanded services offered by the net, and publicity and growth<br>
     of the net.<br>
<p>
Technical information:<br>
<p>
     SDAnet typically generates 80-200 messages per month, sent in bunches<br>
     once or twice a day.  Persons with limited disk space should notify <br>
     the moderator if they are on vacation so that messages can be halted<br>
     for that period.  Users whose account is unreachable for more than <br>
     a week and do not or cannot notify the moderator about this will be<br>
     automatically desubscribed.<br>
<p>
     Anyone may post to this list, and anyone may subscribe.  To do either,<br>
     send electronic mail to Steve Timm, the moderator, at <br>
<p>
     Internet:<br>
     st0o+SDA@andrew.cmu.edu<br>

While reading in the Desire of Ages this evening [Is Not This The <br>
Carpenter's Son]<br>
I was intrigued by this passage:<br>
<p>
"If Christ had called attention to the Pharisees, and had extoled their <br>
learning<br>
and piety, they (Israel) would have hailed Him with joy.  But when He <br>
spoke of the<br>
kingdom of heaven as a dispensation of mercy for all mankind, He was presenting<br>
a phase or religion they would not tolerate.  Their own example and <br>
teaching had<br>
never been such as to make the service of God seem desirable.  When they saw<br>
Jesus giving attention to the very ones they hated and repulsed, it <br>
stirred up the<br>
worst passions of their proud hearts.  Notwithstanding their boast that <br>
under the<br>
'Lion of the tribe of Judah,' (Rev 5:5) Israel should be exalted to <br>
pre-eminence over<br>
all nations, they could have borne the disappointment of their ambitious hopes<br>
better than they could bear Christ's reproof of their sins, and the <br>
reproach they felt<br>
even from the presence of His purity."<br>
<p>
Some paragraphs before it discusses their prejudice, bigotry, <br>
self-righteousness,<br>
worship of status, wealth, and mercilessness.  I wonder what the time <br>
cycle is for<br>
the repetition of history in "the Church" or "Christened"?  How would <br>
we respond if<br>
Christ came to<br>
town pointing up &gt;OUR&lt; prejudices, bigotry, self-righteousness, worship <br>
of status,<br>
wealth, and mercilessness today?  Better still in what specific ways do we act<br>
out "self-righteously", in prejudice/bigotry, seeking status/wealth, and being<br>
unmerciful?  ISN'T THERE AN *overcoming* DEBATE SOMEWHERE ON<br>
SDA NET?<br>
<p>
Marcus<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For your information: We don't get any of the alt groups here at CUC because</i><br>
<i>&gt; the students decided that they arn't worth the disk space.  We don't tell the</i><br>
<i>&gt; administration what we get or don't get and they don't seem to care.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
If and when Union goes on Internet this will be an issue that will be<br>
needed to be dealt with.  At first maybe al will be sent through.. who<br>
knows.  But if it is decided to cut Alt.Sex and other Alt.* gropus then<br>
how do you cut the line?  Who can make the decition?  Would Song of<br>
Solomen be censored or cut from the net if sent today?  I think so.<br>
<p>
If I sign up for a subscription to Playboy (not that I would) could they<br>
refuse to allow me to get that?  Would that not be a violation of postal<br>
code?  Can you not give the same arguments for intnet?  As soon as someone<br>
writes a message to ALL then that is addressed to me.  Do I not have the<br>
write to decide to read it?  This is hairy.  <br>
<p>
I strongly believe in the Bible and what it stands for.  Let me decide<br>
what I do and do not read.  Alow internet to stay a common carrier;<br>
uncensored and unedited and uncut.<br>
<p>
But who knows.  I may not agree with all of the net, but would I cut out<br>
rec.basket weaving because I don't like it? NO.  As a student I do not<br>
have a maniging word on this. But as a student and advacate of internet I<br>
say to let it be and for students to use their heads.<br>
<p>
If Alt.* is cut all a student needs to do is telnet to nyx or some other<br>
public site and read them there.  It would be pointless to block them if<br>
thoguht control is the issue.<br>

Ruben,<br>
I would like to thank you for keeping your responses on such a positive<br>
level, and for defining that the "power" that saves is none other than the<br>
grace of Christ.  I apologize for suggesting that, in some of your<br>
statements, you seemed to be patronizing your opponents.  I just<br>
misunderstood you.<br>
<p>
The more clearly we define our terms, the more room for agreement I find<br>
in your positions, especially with regard to the sanctified life.  The<br>
statement you've quoted several times, where EGW says that if we say we<br>
cannot keep the law perfectly we are accusing God of being unjust, is very<br>
good.  What it means is that we ***can*** keep God's law perfectly by<br>
accepting the perfect righteousness of Christ.  Christ kept the law<br>
perfectly and his perfection is credited to our account.  We can add<br>
nothing to the transaction.<br>
<p>
Concerning original sin, I disagree that it is "extra-biblical," as you<br>
state.  I think it is quite "intra-biblical."  It is such a prevalent<br>
concept, a "given," that there would have been little reason for extended<br>
discourses explaining it in detail.  Because Adam sinned, we are all<br>
conceived in sin.  To be guilty before God a human being does not have to<br>
personally re-experience Adam's fall.  "By one man's disobedience many<br>
were made sinners" (Romans 5:19).  A person is not a sinner solely because<br>
he sins; rather, he is a sinner because he is born from a sinful being. <br>
"Behold I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me"<br>
(Psalm 51:5).  "The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as<br>
soon as they are born, speaking lies" (Psalm 58:3).  Paul states that even<br>
if a person were to never actually commit a sinful act, he would still be<br>
accounted a sinner "after the similitude of Adam's transgression" (Romans<br>
5:14).  <br>
<p>
Concerning original sin, the Bible calls Eve "the mother of all living"<br>
(Genesis 3:20), and the Bible says "Who can bring a clean [sinless] thing<br>
out of an unclean? not one" (Job 14:4).  Concerning the fact that God<br>
holds us responsible for the actions of our forefathers, consider that God<br>
credited Levi with paying tithes while he was yet "in the loins" of<br>
Abraham, four hundred years prior to his birth (Hebrews 7:9,10)!  <br>
<p>
This concludes my part in the discussions related to this thread.  I think<br>
both sides have presented articulate viewpoints.  I appreciate the<br>
contributions of my friend Ruben Gonzalez and others on the net.  These<br>
discussions, I feel, have helped me immensely.  From my perspective, the<br>
matter is now concluded.<br>

Another issue has also surfaced here at Andrews.  We have a number of<br>
Academy students who either use or are interested in using the Internet. <br>
We also have a group of non SDA students from local high schools who come<br>
onto campus to use our facilities in Math and Sciences (including Computer<br>
Science).  Many of these individuals are "minors."  There is a lot of<br>
"adult" material available via Internet: newsgroups, pictures, "dirty"<br>
games, jokes etc.<br>
<p>
The question is this:<br>
<p>
Should these individuals be restricted in their access to these off campus<br>
resources?<br>

While the psychic's prediction was more general in timing and detail, John<br>
Gunter may or may not be a messenger of God.  I think it perfectly conceivable<br>
that God would know what he is going to allow the devil to do on May 3 and<br>
allow him to use his agents, while at the same time God uses His agents to<br>

Steve's note on CAPS being regarded as shouting reminded me that a fair<br>
number of SDAnetters may be fairly new to the world of email, especially<br>
its arcane features.  I am thinking that some aspects of email communication<br>
style may surprise or offend them.<br>
<p>
I recall, altho only vaguely, that some psychologists, a few years back,<br>
studied how people communicated via email versus how they communicated<br>
face-to-face versus how people write to each other (anyone remember more<br>
specifics?).  Their observations, as I recall, were that communication via<br>
email tended to encourage negative traits.  For example, email seemed to<br>
encourage quick, impetuous answers rather than moderated, carefully-thought<br>
ones.  While face-to-face communication has near instant turn-around,<br>
societal customs and the body language feedback we get tend to constrain us<br>
from being offensive.  However, email is without these constraints<br>
and feedback.<br>
<p>
Anyone who can speak more knowledgably or eloquently than I on netiquette,<br>
please do so.  I think it would be helpful to our gentle subscribers.<br>

Hello there<br>
<p>
Bruce posted an interesting question as to the "will of God": is it individual<br>
or is it just moral?  Does He have a will for me, or does He just know what<br>
I should do now based on a general "will guideline" based on certain<br>
principles?<br>
<p>
I would also like to answer without textual evidence at this stage, but I<br>
think this is an important question.<br>
<p>
I have experienced what I percieve as God's will for ME, personally. I was<br>
conscripted into the army while teaching at one of our mission schools. (The<br>
alternative to going was either deferment, or prison.) It's a long story, but<br>
in brief: I asked the Lord whether He wished me to work for Him amoung my<br>
mates in the army, or rather back at the school. I entered the army (as a<br>
non-combattant), and spent just over a week there. A telex then came through<br>
from military headquarters declaring me permanently medically unfit. This<br>
might not seem strange, except for two factors:<br>
<p>
    1. The telex arrived the day before I went for the full medical checkup<br>
    they required. Up to the time of the telex, two army doctors had declared<br>
    they found nothing wrong with me.<br>
<p>
    2. I was so medically fit that about six months before, I had come third<br>
    in Helderberg College's cross country race, and had been running about 3<br>
    miles a day up to the time I went into the army.<br>
<p>
There are many more bits to the jig-saw puzzle of God's will, which allowed me<br>
to see in retrospect, how God had led in various unrelated circumstances.<br>
However here's the last piece of the jig-saw.<br>
<p>
Suddenly, I was without work - a missionary had been sent from the US to take<br>
my place. I phoned the principal. The story he told me was just as<br>
unbelievable. The 'wrong' missionary had been sent. He taught biology and had<br>
basically no Physics/Chemistry training (my subject). However, their biology<br>
teacher had already had to leave due to moral problems. And thus the 'wrong'<br>
missionary was there to teach biology, but they were again without a science<br>
teacher!<br>
<p>
I know this sounds rather personal, but It's just a testimony to the wonderful<br>
way God can lead in a personal way.<br>
<p>
Now, back to the question.  It would seem that witnessing both in the army and<br>
at school was within the 'moral will' of God for me. (Let's leave out the<br>
implications of combatancy versus consciencious objection versus pacifism just<br>
to keep things a little more simple.)  However it would seem that God wanted<br>
me back at our mission school. It makes one feel very humble on the one hand.<br>
On the other hand, it's wonderful to know God is interested in MY life.<br>
<p>
Yes, my personal view is that God is concerned with my every choice.<br>
<p>
CAUTION 1: - I don't believe that if I make one wrong choice, I have "blown<br>
it". God's will for our lives is not one long linear line of choices that He<br>
wishes I would make. It is rather a tree, where at each fork, He can lead us<br>
into the best decision at that point. If we don't see it that way, it is so<br>
easy to say something like "Well, I chose the wife God didn't want me to have<br>
- so I should divorce her and look for the one God did want me to have". And<br>
if I subsequently find she whom I think is the "right" one, and she's married<br>
already, the obvious conclusion is that she also made the wrong choice! Hey<br>
presto, we have another divorce on our hands. Sorry this sounds a little<br>
unreal, but in less important decisions, one can find oneself thinking that<br>
way.<br>
<p>
CAUTION 2: - I don't believe God's will makes my relationship a type of "yes<br>
sir, no sir" relationship. God's primary will for my life is a "moral will"<br>
principle - that I be happy - in the broadest and longest term sense possible.<br>
This includes taking my wishes into account. His interest in me becomes most<br>
personal when He goes out of His way to find out what would make me happiest -<br>
and then leads me into that happyness.<br>
<p>
PSALMS 37:3-5<br>
Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily<br>
thou shalt be fed.<br>
Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine<br>
heart.<br>
Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to<br>
pass.<br>
<p>
This isn't a theological treatise - it's a testimony. It would be nice if<br>
some of you out there would reply with some texts, or further testimonies.<br>

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
True enough.  But you're not the only party involved in the communication;<br>
the college, via its computers, is also.  Therefore, I submit that they are<br>
under the same obligation, corporately, as you (and I) are, individually,<br>
to "make no provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof" (Rom 13:14),<br>
to "flee also youthful lusts" (2 Tim 2:22), to have no contact with<br>
unclean things (cf 2 Cor 6:17), etc, etc.<br>
<p>
Let me give an example:  If I were to buy pornography from an "adult"<br>
store and defile my mind with it, would God only hold me to account?<br>
Or would the owners of the store, the providers, also bear a responsibility?<br>
I submit that they are also accountable to God for what they purvey.  I base<br>
this on another example.<br>
<p>
The children of Israel were old enough to make their own decisions<br>
and most chose of their own free will to follow in the worship of Baal.<br>
Were they responsible for their decisions?  Oh, yes.  And what about<br>
the priests, the providers/purveyors of Baal worship?  Were they also<br>
responsible?  Indeed!  And more so (see 1 Kings 18, esp v.40).<br>

<i>&gt;Hi Beng,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I was just wondering about tuna not having scales. When I lived in Papua</i><br>
<i>&gt;New Guinea we caught some tuna once from the mission boat, and the national</i><br>
<i>&gt;workers cleaned it and ate it. It sure as heck appeared to have scales - </i><br>
<i>&gt;quite substantial ones, from memory. And I'm almost 100% sure it was tuna.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are there different kinds of tuna, or what??</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Not that it worries me much, I don't eat fish any more myself anyway.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Tony</i><br>
<p>
Well, as far as I know, Tuna and Mackarel do not have scales. However, horse<br>
mackerel or Spanish Mackeral and certain kinds of fish which resemble tuna<br>
in appearence, do have scales, so that might have been the fish the workers<br>
caught.<br>
<p>
Actually, I'm not sure that scales is the issue, it could be that Leviticus<br>
was referring to fish in general. But as a rule of thumb, fish that come in<br>
strange shapes, puff up or otherwise look unusual, are very often poisonous<br>
or have venomous spines on their fins. Also, as an aquarium hobbyist, i can<br>
say from experience, that fishes which do not have a protective covering of<br>
scales are much more prone to infection, diseases and parasites than fishes<br>
with scales or body armour. As a matter of interest, the common carp has<br>
been bred into varieties which have only a few large scales on their bodies,<br>
or even no scales at all, whereas the natural wild form has a full covering<br>
of scales, and the migratory european and american eels, although they look<br>
scaleless and slimy, do have very small scales in their skin.<br>

Take it easy Steve.  I think caps lock does make it look like the person<br>
is shouting, and does tend to drive home a point.  <br>
<p>
In American Sign Language, the higher you make the signs, the more<br>
emphasis is placed on the message, sort of like shouting does for<br>
hearing persons.  The story goes of a deaf couple at a marraige renewal<br>
retreat, and the husband signed to the wife "You don't have to talk so<br>
high, I'm not blind, you know!"<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
   I'm a rather passive member of SDAnet, and usually just enjoy listening<br>
to all of the goings on.  This afternoon, some friends came over and we<br>
were discussing all sorts of things and I thought I'd throw this out to <br>
the net.<br>
<p>
   Has anyone heard of NLP (Neural-Linguistic Programming)?  I've just<br>
heard a bit about it and would like to know if any of you have more <br>
information about it?  <br>
<p>
--John (jash@eecs.wsu.edu)<br>

[We had a good discussion on this once but it has been a while.  I <br>
recently discovered in the storage area of our church a "Lab 1" manual,<br>
which is the first step of this seminar.  I'll be glad to supply facts<br>
if folk are interested.  SCT]<br>

I remember about a year ago hearing a very interesting lecture by Dr. <br>
Bill Shea that included information about several archeological sites on <br>
the east side of the Dead Sea.  These cities appear at a suitable<br>
archeological layer to have been destroyed by fire, and it is now thought<br>
that they may be the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.<br>
<p>
Does anyone know where print documentation may be had for this discovery.<br>
I would assume in the Biblical Archaeology Review, to which I have wanted<br>
to subscribe for years but never found the subscription address.  Any <br>
SDAnet members can help us out on this?<br>

At Carnegie Mellon University, freedom of speech is (almost) absolute<br>
(unless you happen to be not Politically Correct).  At Fermilab, however,<br>
when we first got news here, they would only subscribe to the comp and <br>
the sci groups because they claimed the others were not in the mission <br>
of Fermilab.  The other groups still got in though, the bootleg being<br>
led by various system types.  Now we officially get them all.<br>

Isn't the *news* issue something like verbal "news"?  I don't have to<br>
repeat all the garbage I hear by accident, but neither can I shout <br>
"stop talking - I don't agree with you" so that someone else won't hear<br>
what is being said.  <br>
<p>
It might sound over-simplified - but to me censorship is preventing <br>
someone else saying something, whereas a loose tongue is repeating what<br>
someone else has said.  <br>
<p>
So to me the issue is whether WWC or whoever, is actively partaking in<br>
spreading what they don't agree with - especially morally.<br>
<p>
Thus I'd suggest cutting the clear-cut dirty groups - while not disciplining<br>
students who use "devious" means to read them elsewhere.  The fact that<br>
they are available elsewhere restores the student's freedom of choice.<br>
However, the fact that they are cut is a clear statement of belief on the<br>
part of administration.<br>
<p>
I agree it's not a simple issue - but how's this for an approach to<br>
a clearly defined christian  standpoint.<br>

Steve you've asked a hard question.  Hard in not in the sense that there is no<br>
solution, only in that it calls us to make some difficult decisions, <br>
and put for a<br>
not-before-exerted amount of energy.  It means that we must rearrange our<br>
priorities.  It means that the "church" and "family" realize that <br>
neither _just_<br>
the one or _just_ the other can fulfill the needs our children are facing.<br>
Even though I have no children of my own, I say "our children" because as<br>
a member in the body of Christ, I too am responsible to help ALL people<br>
around me.<br>
<p>
TV used correctly, can be a great tool to educate in all areas not just in<br>
religion.  Television used abusively can desensitize, and cloud the mind<br>
from spiritual things as well as "secular" mental exercise (let the grades in<br>
our school systems testify).  Granted that Television can be affecting the<br>
attention spans of our kids, other things might be at work also.  There might<br>
be problems going on in the home, the child may be dealing with issues<br>
which seem urgent, or troublesome thus they give less attention to the<br>
brief escape the puppet show offers.  Don't write these children off, you'll<br>
be surprised what you'll discover in getting close to them to understand<br>
their "world."<br>
<p>
Keep the faith - Hold ON!<br>

To me, Christ painting the picture of dependence on the Father,<br>
is more for our pee-wee brain than for what actually might have<br>
happened.  If Jesus DID depend on the Father, I have *NO*<br>
problem with this.  The crux of the matter is, we had - AND STILL<br>
DO to a great degree - an incorrect view/mental picture of the<br>
Father.<br>
<p>
So as a teacher and mediator, Jesus comes to earth does good<br>
things, reaffirms the principles which God's character and kingdom<br>
are built on and then starts slipping in hints of the reason for it all.<br>
"Psst, hey!  See what I'm doing, its not me - it's the Father!"<br>
And earthlings say, "Oh NOW we get it!  God isn't the fearsome tyrant<br>
waiting to burden us with oppressive law, and zap us out of existence<br>
if/when we fail!"  Of course that didn't happen but for a few whom we<br>
are latter told, turned the then known world upside-down, and even<br>
then weren't *mini-saviours*.<br>
<p>
Again we must come to the essence of it all... Jesus Christ and<br>
Him crucified.  If we try to get into the sheep fold bypassing the<br>
"Gate", we become thieves.<br>

I think this is a good start.  Criticism has been going both ways in <br>
this relationship.<br>
And on both sides of the fence there may be those who criticism out of <br>
the pride<br>
and self-righteousness of their hearts, and those who criticize out of <br>
the pain and<br>
love for what they view are the principles of God's character, law, and <br>
kingdom.<br>
<p>
So how are we - who only see the outside - to differentiate between the two?<br>
Does the present truth/everlasting gospel make that one of our action items as<br>
last day believers?  Or should we all be making a "B-line" to the cross, and<br>
encouraging ever nation, kindred, tongue, and people group to do the same?<br>

Are God and Satan the only ones involved?  Are we to sit back and <br>
say... well God<br>
and Satan have the leading roles in this drama, and we are just <br>
onlookers?  If the<br>
example of Christ's life says nothing else, it says (at least to me) <br>
that WE are<br>
participants in this drama.  Did Jesus sit by and allow people to be <br>
oppressed...<br>
"oh well there's a Great Controversy going these are the results of sin, the<br>
uncontrollable casualties, so we better not get involved."  (see Matt <br>
25: 31-46)<br>
<p>
Are we so "heavenly minded" that we are useless on this earth?  ADRA or <br>
community<br>
service don't count unless you are involved personally - - physically <br>
or financially.<br>
Even then, is our outreach such that it's only a "cover" to get people <br>
into our church,<br>
or is it because we have a genuine burden for them - church or no <br>
church?  We don't<br>
_have_ to be useless on this earth.  And I'm sure that if we (myself as <br>
Chief) spend more<br>
time helping other people, we would have less interest in poking at <br>
splinters in our<br>
neighbor's eyes while whole forests grow in our own.  It's harder to <br>
sit back and point the<br>
finger and call names like "conservative", "liberal", "legalistic", <br>
"immoral" when we are<br>
intimately involved in each other's lives, serving one another.  When <br>
we are being<br>
humane.<br>
<p>
Enough already!  I'm not one who expects a reign of peace [Christ's <br>
peace isn't the<br>
peace of this world (absence of problems differences of opinion) but <br>
complete trust in<br>
Him WHILE the winds of problems, and differences blow] on this earth, this will<br>
only come when Christ returns and smashes this earthly kingdom of <br>
"sacrificed integrity<br>
disregarded conscience, and indulged selfishness" - Desire of Ages <br>
p131.  This earth<br>
kingdom is not just in the hearts of "worldlings", but it's in some of <br>
us who profess to<br>
follow Christ.<br>
<p>
[God, help me to keep my eyes fixed on *You* and cling to the Cross <br>
were I belong.]<br>

Steve, I would be interested in you enlarging how Mich. Conf leaders have<br>
taken EGW out of context in answering "Our Firm Foundation". I presume<br>
this what you are referring to??? Correct?<br>
<p>
It would almost seem from some of the email that God has nothing to do<br>
with appointing church leaders any more? Is this true in your opinion?<br>
<p>
Is it true that we can prove anything "under the sun" from EGW?<br>
<p>
Paul<br>

<i>&gt;this what you are referring to??? Correct?</i><br>
<p>
I don't recall whether or not I said "out of context".  But in context<br>
or not, the use was inappropriate.  Even the Devil can quote the Bible<br>
when it  is to his advantage.<br>
  In the fall of 1990 I posted a detailed series summarizing in detail<br>
the position taken by those published in Our Firm Foundation about the<br>
nature of Christ. The series also included a letter that was sent to the<br>
membership of the Michigan conference criticizing Hope International,<br>
its publishers, with holding camp meetings in Michigan without bothering<br>
to ask the conference leadership.  The pamphlet included a one-line<br>
quote from EGW that workers should always consult with the local leaders<br>
in a field before holding an effort.<br>
<p>
While this principle is a good principle, the tactic being used was using <br>
Ellen White to bolster their argument.  The theological term for this is<br>
"isogesis"--roughly, drawing out of a text what you wish to get of it. <br>
I reject the use of inspired writings as projectiles, no matter who does<br>
it.<br>
I would use Ellen White's statement that "The testimonies are never to<br>
be used as a club or whip" to back me up, but that would be an argument<br>
to authority, which would not be valid.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It would almost seem from some of the email that God has nothing to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;with appointing church leaders any more? Is this true in your opinion?</i><br>
God still does have something to do with appointing church leaders, and<br>
I believe He has led in the appointing of the leadership in my<br>
conference, <br>
union, division, and world church.  Our conference president is a<br>
dedicated man who puts his money where his mouth is, opening his home to<br>
the young people of the "Twentysomething" age bracket such as myself. <br>
However, as these dedicated leaders attempt to apply themselves to<br>
preserving the institutions that absorb 90% of our tithe, they are<br>
fighting a losing battle, I believe.  In the small churches, the age of<br>
post-institutional, post-subculture Adventism has already begun.  If our<br>
leaders lose the battle for institutions but win the battle for souls,<br>
it will be a job well done, and I want to support them in every way I<br>
can.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Is it true that we can prove anything "under the sun" from EGW?</i><br>
<p>
Pretty close.  But those who try are setting the rules of logic and<br>
debate above the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  <br>
<p>
For those of you who have not read books of Ellen G. White, I would urge <br>
you to do so, not to try to score a point here or there, but to hear<br>
what she has to say.  And accept the counsel not as a "magic hand-down"<br>
of a book <br>
of "don'ts", but for the reason she would want you to accept it--it's<br>
good counsel and makes sense.<br>

To David Buxton<br>
<p>
Dave, I perceive from what  you say that we should not over react on this<br>
business of Unity. EGW says that there is unity in diversity.<br>
<p>
I notice in Manuscript 111, written in 1903 that EGW said, "Unity with<br>
Christ establishes a bond of unity with one another. this unity is the<br>
most convincing proof to the world of the majesty and virtue of Christ,<br>
and of His power to take away sin." <br>
<p>
In John 17:20-23 it talks about the unity that is to exist between Christ<br>
and His followers. RH June 1, 1905, EGW is making the point that the unity<br>
that is to exist bwtween Christ and His followers does not destroy the<br>
personality of either. They are to one with Him as he is one with the<br>
Father.<br>
<p>
In the RH, July 4 1899 EGW also says, "The strength of God's people lies<br>
in their union with Him through His only begotten Son, and their union<br>
with one another. There are no two leaves of a tree precisely alike;<br>
neither do all minds run in the same direction. But while this is so,<br>
there may be unity in diversity. Christ is our root, and all who are<br>
grafted into this root will bear the fruit which Christ bore. They will<br>
reveal the frangrance of His character in the talent of speech, in the<br>
cultivation of hospitality, of kindness, of christian courtesy and<br>
heavenly politeness."<br>
<p>
 From your message you seem to be indicating that Unity is really on the<br>
side of Antichrist but not on the part of Christians. Do you mean to say<br>
this? How do you feel about having a relationship with Christ through the<br>
Holy Spirit? Is it possible not to have a relationship with Christ and<br>
still have the assurance of salvation?<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;Pastor Paul&gt;&gt;<br>

In discussing Catholic vs Protestant it is not so much my objective to  talk<br>
about  the  RCC  vs  the  various Protestant churches.  Rather to talk about<br>
certain philosophies that are Catholic vs Protestant.<br>
<p>
Protestant, as I am defining it, places  the  individual  conscience  first.<br>
The  individual  conscience  before  God,  as he/she seeks to understand the<br>
Bible is what stands supreme.  Church and state must be subservient  to  the<br>
individual conscience.  This was the basis of the Protestant reformation and<br>
the United States Constitution.  This is what took men's necks  out  of  the<br>
stocks  of  the  early  pioneer days.  Even those in the minority can have a<br>
conscience that church and state must be subservient to.<br>
<p>
Catholic, in any church or state, places the church (or state) in command of<br>
man's conscience.  It is the clergy, of what ever church, who define what is<br>
doctrine and what is the creed of the church.  Only the eminent men  at  the<br>
top are seen to have the training necessary to properly interpret scripture.<br>
Members are  expected  to  place  their  individual  conscience  and  belief<br>
subservient  to that of such learned men.  "The greater good of the people",<br>
"the greater good of the church", "Unity"; these are the banners under which<br>
the  individual  is made subservient.  We see some of the same undertones in<br>
the Supreme  Court  judiciary  where  separation  of  church  and  state  is<br>
increasingly  questioned  and  the greater good for the majority is becoming<br>
more important than the individual conscience.<br>
<p>
The Protestant Reformation started out Protestant.   But  in  many  ways  it<br>
became  increasingly  Catholic.  Example -- Luther urged his followers to be<br>
friendly and warm to  the  Jews,  anticipating  that  they  would  join  the<br>
Protestant  Reformation.   But  when  they  planted  their  feet  firmly  in<br>
rejection of both the RCC and  the  Reformation,  then  Luther  became  very<br>
strong  against the Jews, even in a persecuting way.  The Annabaptists urged<br>
that the individual conscience stood supreme above the greater good  of  the<br>
Protestant  Movement.   And so Calvin, Luther and other leaders turned, in a<br>
Catholic way, against these Protestant dissidents.<br>
<p>
Catholic dogma can, interestingly enough,  tend  to  be  more  liberal  than<br>
conservative.  Let me explain.  Rome, the soil upon which Catholic grew, was<br>
the melting pot of religions from around the  world.   Those  peoples  whose<br>
religions  melted  into  the  Roman pot were accepted into the Roman Empire.<br>
Otherwise, Rome attempted  to  melt  those,  such  as  the  Jews  and  early<br>
Christians, out of existence.  Catholicism has learned much from Rome in its<br>
ability to be a melting pot of religions and  yet  to  persecute  those  who<br>
refuse  to be melted.  Catholicism embraces the largest spectrum of doctrine<br>
of any Christian church and yet can be very  inflexible  against  those  who<br>
refuse to be swept up in her broad net.<br>
<p>
Carl Rahner  is  one  of  the   better   known   Jesuit  architects  of  the<br>
Ecumenical  Movement.    In  one of his books he responds to the concerns of<br>
some of his friends that there  could  be  a  grass  roots  rebellion  among<br>
Protestants  against  the  Ecumenical  Movement.   He  writes, in one of his<br>
books, that they need not worry  because  the  Protestant  memberships  have<br>
become just as subservient to their leadership as the Catholics are to their<br>
Papacy.  This is virtually to say that most Protestants have already  become<br>
Catholic,  already  willing  to yield personal conscience to the moulding of<br>
their leadership.  Right now the ecumenical plan is to cast out as  large  a<br>
net  as  possible.  There will be plenty of time later to tighten in the net<br>
and to squeeze out the  dissidents  who  are  not  willing  to  yield  blind<br>
allegiance to church authority.<br>
<p>
What about the Seventh-Day-Adventist membership?  Are we  still  Protestants<br>
upholding  the  individual  conscience?   Do we continue to promote the idea<br>
that God inspired the Bible  as  a  book  that  laymen  can  understand  for<br>
themselves?   Or  are  we  becoming  Catholic,  with  belief  and conscience<br>
increasingly subservient to  church  leadership?   What  does  our  church's<br>
declaration  of  war  against  the  "Independent  Ministries" (including Joe<br>
Crews), have to say about the Catholic vs Protestant nature of  our  church?<br>
Have  the "independents" become what the Annabaptists were to the Protestant<br>
Churches of that erra?  Is  our  reaction  to  the  'independents'  becoming<br>
increasingly Catholic?  And, have some of the 'independents' become Catholic<br>
in their treatment of the rest of the church?<br>
<p>
Do we uphold the individual conscience, making church and state subservient?<br>
Are  we  Protestant?   Or  are  we  Catholic, insisting that "Unity" and the<br>
greater good for the church assert authority over the individual conscience?<br>
<p>

Last week-end Dr. Coffin was the guest and brought a lot of slides<br>
on geology, presenting, as a paleantologist, the creation perspective.<br>
<p>
I wish I had taken lots of notes, but I didn't.<br>
<p>
Quotes from Darwin that the lack of gradations or links could prove<br>
a problem for his theory, but a firm expection that this was a new<br>
area of geologic study and in time these links would be found.  But<br>
they have not been found.  The life forms in the Plaestocene are<br>
rather complex.  Todays versions of these life forms are often less<br>
complex.<br>
<p>
An 'early' bird with feathers and bones that match the format of a<br>
bird that flew, and yet claimed to be a grounded 'link' between the<br>
reptile and the bird.  But there is no record of feathers evolving.<br>
Also, more recent discoveries of these bird skelitons with more<br>
'modern' birds at deaper levels.  Can the son be the father of his<br>
grandfather?<br>
<p>
No hint at all of anything in the geological 'record' that would lead<br>
up to the turtle.<br>
<p>
He brought fossils of whole bodied fish with scales in good form.<br>
They have about a 1/4 to 1/2 inch of petrified casing that is best<br>
explained by body fluids oozing out into the surrounding sand or<br>
what ever.  That area of Brazil is litered with these fish that look<br>
like smooth loaves of french bread, each with a whole bodied fish inside.<br>
Studies have shown that in about 6.5 days a fishes flesh will completely<br>
rot away and the bones disconnect.  Cross sections through the gill<br>
chambers of these fossil fish from Brazil show the gills in a form<br>
that would only be found minutes after death.  Elsewhere deposits of<br>
thousands of square miles of fish scales that cannot possibly be from<br>
natural sedimentation since fish scales do not naturally deposit on the<br>
bottom of lakes and oceans, they rot and/or are devoured.<br>
<p>
Some years ago geologists were mostly of the catastrophy, even Bible<br>
flood philosophy.  One key reason a lot of these geologists converted to<br>
the evolutionary position was the finding of a lot of upright trees<br>
in deep coal beds.  But more recently there have been upside down trees<br>
found in coal beds.  When St. Helens blew, a lot of trees were blown<br>
over and thousands of trees were swept into spirit lake.  Coffin was<br>
the first to take a team of scientists up to Spirit lake as soon as<br>
the road was bulldozed.  They went scuba diving with cameras.  Most<br>
of the trees were still floating horizontal on the surface.  But quite<br>
a few were upright with a foot or two up above surface.  Some were<br>
floating free and some were grounded.  The scuba divers found that<br>
thousands of trees were standing upright, grounded on the bottom of<br>
the lake.  These are not trees standing where they grew, rather trees<br>
swept off the mountain by the blast of the erruption and/or the mud<br>
flows.  Many scientists are referring to Spirit lake as a coal field<br>
in the making.<br>
<p>
More and more Christians are espousing the idea that creation week took<br>
thousands of years.  Coffin offered a long list of objections to this<br>
theory.  I can recall a few of them:<br>
<p>
 * Yes, the old Hebrew did at times mean more than a day when the word<br>
   for day is used.  But not so in the context of "evening and morning<br>
   were the first day . . . .  Also, when Hebrew speaks of 1st day, or<br>
   2nd day, or 3'd day, it never means anything but a single day.  The<br>
   days of Abraham's life may have been more than a few days, but the<br>
   day his son was born was a single day.<br>
<p>
 * When did sin enter this earth?  Christians answer that it happened<br>
   when Eve and Adam sinned.  So, no death and dying before then.  But<br>
   if you insist that creation week was thousands of years long, then<br>
   you have to examine the geologic record as spanning many many<br>
   thousands of years; hence it is not the flood that explains the<br>
   'ancient' geology, but supposed God guided evolution.  So, the story<br>
   of Noah must be a fable.  Also, consider that the geologic record<br>
   shows animal predation, a lot of dog eat dog, in the layers before<br>
   man shows up.  Clearly, if creation week took thousands of years,<br>
   then there was sin in this earth long before Adam and Eve.<br>
<p>
 * A lot of Christians who have been taught the thousands of years<br>
   theory find it difficult to believe in the soon return of Jesus<br>
   to take us home with Him.  Some question that He will even return.<br>
   If the Bible says it took a week but it took thousands, even millions<br>
   of years, then will it yet be thousands, even millions of years<br>
   before His return.  If God lacks the power of creation week, then<br>
   how can He ressurect the dead?<br>
<p>
Problems with carbon 14 dating.  Assumption of uniformity.  But lots<br>
of examples that uniformity does not hold up.  That Carbon 14 and<br>
other dating schemes fail past a few thousand years.<br>
<p>
New lava flows that at sea level date ~0 years old.  But with depth<br>
the dates get to be thousands and millions of years old.  Evidently<br>
water pressure slows the de-gassing of these structures.<br>
<p>
A cave down in grand canyon.  The petrified dung heap of a giant sloth.<br>
Dating back through that dung heap.  The giant sloth must have been<br>
horribly constipated.<br>
<p>
Magnetic reversal, that the earth takes many thousands of years to<br>
reverse its magnetism.  But recently discovered lava formations in<br>
which have been found several magnetic reversals.  These lava formations<br>
could not possibly have taken many thousands of years to cool and set<br>
their magnetic fields in place.<br>
<p>
One theory is that all basic animal types marched off the ark, across<br>
the land bridges and around the globe, but in time they extincted in<br>
different areas of the earth.  This theory would propose that there<br>
might well have been kangaroos elsewhere, but they died out, except<br>
for Australia.  This theory would propose a richer variety of animals<br>
closer to where the ark settled.  Coffin points out that while this<br>
theory makes some sense for the animals; the widest variety of birds<br>
are to be found in South America.  But of course the birds would have<br>
more mibility to scatter across the earth.<br>
<p>
What about plate tectonics?  He finds that a valid theory.  But at some<br>
time things must have moved a whole lot faster.  At present sedementing<br>
rates and continental movement rates the sedementing would have more than<br>
kept up with the opening rifts.  There would be no deep ocean depths.<br>
Sedementation would easily have filled those deep trenches as fast<br>
as they opened up.  It appears that the continents did move around, but<br>
it could not have happened at the slow rate we see today.<br>
<p>
I asked him about DNA.  I had read a few years ago about scientists<br>
confidant that DNA studies would establish the animal family tree,<br>
perhaps re-aranging some of the branches, yet more properly establishing<br>
the family tree of the animal kingdom.  These studies have not proven out<br>
as anticipated.<br>

Christine,<br>
In response to your question of people willing to help maintain<br>
the list, I will be willing to help maintain SDA-L if no one else volunteers.<br>
I suspect that the technical side of it causes Enoch even more trouble than<br>
the list causes you.  I know there's a lot of expired addresses on the list.<br>
I think having a LISTSERV technology is a very important step to have,<br>
and I want to do what I can to ensure that the opportunity isn't lost.<br>

The latest issue of McCall's describes behavior modification and NLP.<br>
<p>
  "The effective use of both behavior modification and NLP involves not<br>
  telling the other person what you're up to.  If that seems manipulative,<br>
  behavioral scientist Karen Pryor, a former dolphin trainer recognized as<br>
  one of the foremost researchers of animal and human behavior, offers<br>
  reassurance.  "We all go around trying to manipulate one another's<br>
  behavior all the time," she says -- and usually with tactics that don't<br>
  work.  Pryor, who is the author of the practical and delightful<br>
  behavior-modification handbook, Don't Shoot the Dog!  The New Art of<br>
  Teaching and Training, points out that "discussing your stragegies will<br>
  only interfere with and weaken their power."<br>
<p>
The article also explains B.F. Scinner techniques that you are probably<br>
all familiar with.  Sounds like what animal trainers have learned are<br>
the techniques more and more being used on humans.<br>
<p>
NLP techniques described.  For example tapping the table with finger<br>
tips in synch with the other person's breathing.  Once link is<br>
subconciously established, then tap faster to create a feeling of<br>
excitement or slower for relaxation.  Seeing that you can speed up<br>
or slow down their breathing, try other "leading" techniques.  Quoting:<br>
<p>
  "If you really want to see magic, try using two or more NLP techniques<br>
  together," says Brooks.  "Once your'e on the same wavelength, you can<br>
  verbally disagree without jeopardizing the relationship."<br>
<p>
The author of the McCall's article, in the last paragraph:<br>
<p>
  Does all this sound far-fetched?  Someone once used NLP on me, and it<br>
  was spookily powerful.  . . . . .<br>
<p>
Well, the debate rages on, at least out here, as to whether NLP is<br>
innocent or dangerous, whether its innocent hypnotism, dangerous<br>
hypnotism or not even hypnotism.  The article names those who 'invented'<br>
NLP.  Their books call it hypnotism of a form that is not readily<br>
detectable as hypnotism, hense it's greater power, they claim.<br>

We discussed NLP a couple months ago, but let me define terms for those who<br>
weren't with us then.  NLP is Neuro-linguistic Programming, and B.F.Skinner<br>
is the (in)famous behaviorist psychologist who developed the theory and<br>
practice of operant conditioning.<br>
<p>
This thing shows me how careful we should be to guard the avenues of the <br>
subconscious.  If there is hypnotism or mind control of any sort, it doesn't<br>
belong in our church.<br>
<p>
Recently William Johnsson wrote an editorial in the Adventist Review<br>
saying how he opposed hypnotism but didn't necessarily oppose Lab 1,<br>
the first step in the series towards NLP.  He tried to suggest that only <br>
Lab I was approved by the conference, but didn't say anything of those<br>
pastors who may be taking lab 2 on their own.  <br>
<p>
I know there are some people on the list who have mentioned going through <br>
Lab 1 before.  Does that involve some of the techniques described by Dave<br>
in his article?<br>
<p>
If we abandon the ultimate persuading power of the Holy Spirit for<br>
these mind games, we have a problem.  If we spend all our energy fighting<br>
these techniques, we have a problem, too.<br>

"Hasta Hoy" is the Spanish version of Patty Cabrera's self-titled<br>
debut album, also released on Dayspring.  I saw it in my local Christian <br>
Bookstore in the Spanish section, but didn't buy, mainly because I <br>
don't understand spanish very well, but I could make out enough to see<br>
that the songs on the album are effectively the same tunes.<br>
<p>
Has anyone heard it all the way through?  Are the translations good?<br>
This is a growing market that only a few CCM artists (Steve Green is <br>
another) are willing or able to tap.<br>

I had heard several times before that in the New Testament, there<br>
are several very specific, but related words having to do with sin.<br>
When Ruben Gonzalez was talking a while back about a very narrow definition<br>
of sin (only the act), I looked this up, but the Greek concordance in <br>
Strong's didn't tell me very much.  <br>
<p>
Could it be possible, given the definition of sin in the Bible, <br>
that there are some things which are not sin, but are still wrong?<br>
I would appreciate insight on the meaning of such words as offense,<br>
iniquity, transgression, and sin, and the shades of meaning between them.<br>

At our Twentysomething young adult program here in the Chicago area,  we<br>
spent last Friday night in lively discussion about several "hot" issues<br>
for Adventists, including if one ought to go to a friend's farewell party<br>
on Friday night and if it was OK to model in a fashion show wearing <br>
jewelry.  <br>
<p>
I was in the small group discussing jewelry.  Also in this group was <br>
Lynette, a first-time visitor with a Catholic background, and earrings in <br>
her ears.  Everyone in the group was careful not to condemn her, but<br>
she remarked afterwards that some people were avoiding eye contact with her.<br>
She also told us, "It seems like there's a lot more important things to <br>
talk about than jewelry."<br>
<p>
Now, while I believe standards are important and have defended them in <br>
this forum before, I'm forced to agree with her.  [Note:  if anyone<br>
responds to this thread arguing either the merits or the demerits of <br>
jewelry, I will reject the post.]   What are some issues that do have <br>
more import that one can discuss at such a meeting where non-Adventists<br>
are usually present.  I think that sometimes SDAnet suffers from the <br>
same disease of majoring in minors.  I can always use a good discussion <br>
topic here and at this young adults group, as it's my turn to lead it in<br>
three months.  <br>
<p>
Consider this topic for a minute:  If all the people from the local area<br>
of your church that visited it stayed, how much would your church grow?<br>

When I saw Scott Mattes post about Joseph Smith, my first idea was to <br>
want to reject it.  The second was to want to go run and dig out all the <br>
dirt on Mormons I could find.   But then I wondered, why should I be so<br>
upset when someone else has found the truth, as we have?  If more people <br>
live healthily, who should we be to complain? <br>
<p>
Seventh-day Adventism is not by nature an original religion in any case.<br>
We're not upset because the Jews or the Seventh-day Baptists got to the <br>
Sabbath first.  Luther figured out about the priesthood of all believers<br>
and justification by faith long before we did.  The goal of all churches<br>
which claim uniqueness, and the Mormons and Catholics both join us in this<br>
claim, is that we reflect the New Testament church in doctrine and practice.<br>
Obviously this gives three orthogonal views of what the church must have <br>
been like.  <br>
<p>
If you have felt threatened by either of the two articles on Mormon<br>
health messages, try to examine why, and please post why.  Of course,<br>
we must also recognize that quite a similar health message has been in <br>
Islam for hundreds of years, although it may or may not have been<br>
known to E.G. White and J. Smith.  Does anyone want to put forth the case<br>
that one should choose Islam on these grounds?<br>

Steve asked for some definitions and distinctions for the <br>
words, sin, iniquity, transgression, etc.  I have taken the <br>
following from "AN EXPOSITORY DICTIONARY OF NEW TESTATMENT <br>
WORDS with their Precise Meanings for English Readers" by W. <br>
E. Vine.  I have not tried to list all the verses that use <br>
each word as these should be available in your concordance.  <br>
 From the previous discussion about perfection, it might be <br>
very revealing to look up the verses and see which actual <br>
Greek word was used to assist in the interpretation.<br>
<p>
*************************************************************<br>
<p>
WORDS FOR *SIN*<br>
<p>
1.  HAMARTIA (noun) is, literally, a missing of the mark, but <br>
this etymological meaning is largely lost sight of in the NT.  <br>
It is the most comprehensive term for moral obliquity.  It is <br>
used of sin as<br>
<p>
	(a) a principle or source of action, or an inward <br>
element producing acts, e.g., Rom. 3:9; 5:12,13,20; 6:1,2; <br>
7:7,8,9,11,13, "sin, that it might be shewn to be sin,"  <br>
i.e., "sin became death to me, that it might be exposed in <br>
its heinous character:  in the last clause, "sin might become <br>
exceeding sinful,"  i.e., through the holiness of the Law, <br>
the true nature of sin was designed to be manifested to the <br>
conscience;<br>
<p>
	(b) a governing principle or power, e.g., Rom. 6:6, <br>
"(the body) of sin", here sin is spoken of as an organized <br>
power, acting through the members of the body, though the <br>
seat of sin is in the will (the body is the organic <br>
instrument);  in the next clause, and in other passages, as <br>
follows, this governing principle is personified, e.g., Rom. <br>
5:21; 6:12,14,17; 7:11,14,17,20,23,25; 8:2; I Cor. 15:56; <br>
Heb. 3:13; 11:25; 12:4; Jas. 1:15 (2nd part);<br>
<p>
	(c) a generic term (distinct from specific terms such as <br>
HAMARTEMA, yet sometimes inclusive of concrete wrong doing, <br>
e.g., John 8:21,34,46; 9:41; 15:22,24; 19:11); in Rom. 8:3, <br>
"God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh," <br>
literally, 'flesh of sin,' the flesh stands for the body, the <br>
instrument of indwelling sin [Christ, pre-existently the Son <br>
of God, assumed human flesh, "of the substance of the Virgin <br>
Mary;" the reality of incarnation was His, without taint of <br>
sin (for homoioma, likenss], "and as an offering for sin,"  <br>
i.e., 'a sin-offering', "condemned sin in the flesh,"  i.e., <br>
Christ, having taken human nature, sin apart (Heb. 4:15), and <br>
having lived a sinless life, died under the condemnation and <br>
judgment due to our sin; for the generic sense see further, <br>
e.g., Heb. 9:26; 10:6,8,18; 13:11; I John 1:7,8; 3:4 (1st <br>
part; in the 2nd part, sin is defined as "lawlessness"), 8,9; <br>
in these verses the A.V. use of the verb to commit is <br>
misleading; not the commital of an act is in view, but a <br>
continuous course of sin, as indicted by the R.V., "doeth."  <br>
The Apostle's use of the present tense of poieo, to do, <br>
virtually expresses the meaning of prasso, to practise, which <br>
John does not use (it is not infrequent in this sense in <br>
Paul's Epp., e.g., Rom 1:32 RV; 2:1; Gal 5:21; Phil 4:9); I <br>
Pet 4:1 (singular in the best texts, literally, 'has been <br>
made to cease from sin,' i.e., as a result of suffering in <br>
the flesh, the mortifying of our members, and of obedience to <br>
a Saviour who suffered in flesh.  Such no longer lives in the <br>
flesh, "to the lusts of men, but to the will of God;"  <br>
sometimes the word is used virtually equivalent to a <br>
condition of sin, e.g., John 1:29, "the sin (not sins) of the <br>
word;"  I Cor 15:17; or a course of sin, characterized by <br>
continuous acts, e.g., I Thes 2:16; in I John 5:16 (2nd part) <br>
the RV margin, is probably to be preferred, "there is sin <br>
unto death," not a special act of sin, but the state or <br>
condition producing acts; in ver 17, "all unrighteousness is <br>
sin" is not a definition of sin (as in 3:4), it gives a <br>
specification of the term in its generic sense;<br>
<p>
	(d) a sinful deed, an act of sin, e.g., Matt 12:31; Acts <br>
7:60; Jas 1:15 (1st part); 2:9; 4:17; 5:15,20; I John 5:16 <br>
(1st part).<br>
<p>
Notes: (1)  Christ is predicated as having been without sin <br>
in every respect, e.g., (a),(b),(c) above, 2 Cor 5:21 (1st <br>
part); I John 3:5; John 14:30; (d) John 8:46; Heb 4:15; I Pet <br>
2:22.  (2) In Heb 9:28 (2nd part) the reference is to a sin <br>
offering.  (3) In 2 Cor 5:21, "Him. . . He made to be sin" <br>
indicates that God dealt with Him as He must deal with sin, <br>
and that Christ fulfilled what was typified in the guilt <br>
offering.  (4) For the phrase "man of sin" in 2 Thes 2:3, see <br>
Iniquity, ANOMIA.<br>
<p>
HAMARTENA (noun), akin to HAMARTIA, denotes an act of <br>
disobedience to Divine law [as distinct from HAMARTIA <br>
(a),(b),(c)].<br>
<p>
ANAMARTETOS (adj), without sin, negative form of HAMARTIA <br>
(c).is found in John 8:7.<br>
<p>
HAMARTANO (verb), literally, to miss the mark<br>
<p>
PROAMARTANO (verb), to sin previously<br>
<p>
*************************************************************<br>
<p>
Words for *Iniquity*<br>
<p>
ANOMIA, literally, lawlessness, is used in a way which <br>
indicates the meaning as being lawlessness or wickedness.  <br>
Its usualy rendering in the NT is "iniquity," which literally <br>
mean unrighteousness.  It occurs frequently in the Sept., <br>
especially in the Psalms, where it is found about 70 times.  <br>
It is used (a) of iniquity in general; (b) in the plural, of <br>
acts or manifestations of lawlessness<br>
<p>
ADIKIA denotes unrighteousness, literally, 'unrightness', a <br>
condition of not being right, whether with God, according to <br>
the standard of His holiness and righteousness, or with man, <br>
according to the standard of what man knows to be right by <br>
his conscience.<br>
<p>
ADIKEMA denotes a wrong, injury, misdeed, the concrete act, <br>
in contrast to the general meaning of ADIKIA.<br>
<p>
PONERIA, akin to PONEO, to toil, denotes wickedness and is so <br>
translated in Matt 22:18; Mark 7:22; Luke 11:39; Rom 1:29; I <br>
Cor 5:8; Eph 6:12; Acts 3:26.<br>
<p>
PARANOMIA, law-breaking, denotes transgression<br>
<p>
*************************************************************<br>
<p>
Words for *transgress*<br>
<p>
PARABAINO (verb), literally, to go aside, hence to go beyond, <br>
is chiefly used metaphorically in transgressing the tradition <br>
of the elders, Matt 15:2; the commandment of God, 15:3; in <br>
Acts 1:25, of Judas "by transgressions fell away";<br>
<p>
HUPERBAINO (verb), literally, to go over, used metaphorically <br>
and rendered "transgress" in I Thes 4:6, i.e., of <br>
overstepping the limits separating chastity from <br>
licentiousness, sanctification from sin.<br>
<p>
PARERCHOMAI (verb), to come by, pass over, and hence, <br>
metaphorically, to transgress, is so used in Luke 15:29.<br>
<p>
PARABASIS (noun), primarily a going aside, then, an <br>
overstepping, is used metaphorically to denote transgression <br>
(always of a breach of law):  (a) of Adam, Rom. 5:14; (b) of <br>
Eve, I Tim 2:14; (c) negatively, where there is no law, since <br>
transgression implies the violation of law, none having been <br>
enacted between Adam's transgression and those under the Law, <br>
Rom 4:15;  (d) of transgressions of the Law, Gal 3:19, where <br>
the statement "it was added because of transgressions" is <br>
best understood according to Rom 4:15; 5:13 and 5:20; the Law <br>
does not make men sinners, but makes them trangressors; hence <br>
sin becomes "exceeding sinful," Rom 7:7,13.  Conscience thus <br>
had a standard external to itself;  by the Law men are taught <br>
their inability to yield complete obedience to God, that <br>
thereby they may become convinced of their need of a Saviour.<br>
<p>
PARANOMIA (noun), law-breaking (contrary to law)<br>
<p>
PARABATES, literally and primarily, one who stands beside, <br>
then, one who oversteps the prescribed limit, a transgressor.<br>
<p>
ANOMOS, without law is translated "trangressor" is Luke 22:37 <br>
is really lawlessness.<br>
<p>
*************************************************************<br>
<p>
Words for *fault*<br>
<p>
AITION (noun), causative of, responsible for, is used as a <br>
noun, a crime, a legal ground for punishment<br>
<p>
AMEMPTOS (adj), without blame, is render "faultless" in Heb <br>
8:7; without any shortcoming, in Jude 24, and "without fault" <br>
in Rev. 14:5.<br>
<p>
MEMPHOMAI (verb), to blame, is translated "to find fault" in <br>
Rom 9:19 and Heb 8:8.<br>
<p>
ELENCHO (verb), to convict, reprove, rebuke, is translated <br>
"shew (him) his fault" in Matt 18:15.<br>
<p>
*************************************************************<br>
<p>
Words for *error*<br>
<p>
PLANE, a wandering, a forsaking of the right path, see Jas <br>
5:20, whether in doctrine, 2 Pet 3:17; I John 4:6, or in <br>
morals, Rom 1:27; 2 Pet 2:18; Jude 11, though, in scripture, <br>
doctrine and morals are never divided by any sharp line.  <br>
Errors in doctrine are not infrequently the effect of relaxed <br>
morality, and vice versa.<br>
<p>
AGNOEMA, a sin of ignorance, is used in the plural in Heb 9:7<br>
<p>
*************************************************************<br>
<p>
Words for *disobedience*<br>
<p>
APIETHEIA (noun), literally, the condition of being <br>
unpersuadable, denotes obstinacy, obstinate rejection of the <br>
will of God; hence, "disobedience;"  Eph 2:2; 5:6; Col 3:6; <br>
Rom 11:30,32 and Heb 4:6,11 speaking of Isreal, past and <br>
present.<br>
<p>
PARAKOE (noun), primarily, hearing amiss, hence signifies a <br>
refusal to hear; hence, an act of disobedience, Rom 5:19; 2 <br>
Cor 10:6; Heb 2:2.  It is broadly to be distinguished from <br>
APEITHEIA, as an act from a condition, though PARAKOE itself <br>
is the effect, in transgression, of the condition of failing <br>
or refusing to hear.  Carelessness in attitude is the <br>
precursor of actual disobedience.  In the OT disobedience is <br>
frequently described as a refusing to hear.<br>
<p>
APEITHES (Adj), signifies unwilling to be persuaded, spurning <br>
belief, disobedient<br>
<p>
APEITHEO (verb), to refuse to be persuaded, to refuse belief<br>
<p>
*************************************************************<br>
<p>
Words for *perfect*<br>
<p>
TELEIOS (adj) signifies having reached its end, finished, <br>
complete, perfect.  It is used of (I) persons (a) primarily <br>
of physical development, then, with ethical import, fully <br>
grown, mature, I Cor 2:6; 14:20; Eph 4:13; Phil 3:15; Col <br>
1:28; 4:12;  (2) complete, conveying the idea of goodness <br>
without necessary reference to maturity or what is expressed <br>
under (a), Matt 5:48; 19:21; Jas 1:4; 3:2  It is used thus of <br>
God in Matt 5:48;  (II) of things, complete, perfect, Rom <br>
12:2; I Cor 13:10 (referring to the complete revelation of <br>
God's will and ways, wheter in the completed Scriptures or in <br>
the hereafter); Jas 1:4 (of the work of patience); ver 25; I <br>
john 4:18.<br>
<p>
TELEIOTEROS (adj), the comparative degree of TELEIOS, is used <br>
in Heb 9:11, of the very presence of God.<br>
<p>
ARTIOS (adj) is translated "perfect" in 2 Tim 3:17 is really <br>
form of *complete*<br>
<p>
TELEIOO (verb), to bring to an end by completing or <br>
perfecting is used (I) of accomplishing; (II) of bringing to <br>
completeness<br>
<p>
EPITELEO (verb), to bring through to the end, is used in the <br>
Middle Voice in Gal 3:3, "are ye (now) perfected," continuous <br>
present tesne, indicating a process, literally, 'are ye now <br>
perfecting yourselves;'<br>
<p>
KATARTIZO (verb), to render fit, complete.  It does not <br>
necessarily imply, nowever, that that to which it is applied <br>
has been damaged, though it may do so; it signifies, rather, <br>
right ordering and arrangement.  It indicates a close <br>
relationship between character and destiny.<br>
<p>
AKRIBOS (adv), accurately, is tranlated "perfectly" in I Thes <br>
5:2 where it suggests that Paul and his companions were <br>
careful ministers of the Word.<br>
<p>
AKRIBESTERON (adv), the comparative degree of AKRIBOS, <br>
carefully, exactly.<br>
<p>
TELEIOS (adv), perfectly, is so translated in I Pet 1:13 RV <br>
of setting one's hope on coming grace.<br>

like a specific verse or word (any word) looked up, I'd be <br>

I just had a thought as I have read your message David. What about<br>
evangelists manipulating people to be baptized and join a church. Is that<br>
wrong?<br>

Steve, When I was living in Spring Lake, MI we had a seminar at the<br>
Holland, MI church. I should say it was Lab 1. I found nothing wrong with<br>
any of the principles or precepts that we learned. What I have learned has<br>
been a help in my visiting of church members as well as non-church<br>
members. I found nothing wrong with it.<br>

[NLP discussion]<br>
<i>&gt; If we abandon the ultimate persuading power of the Holy Spirit for</i><br>
<i>&gt; these mind games, we have a problem.  If we spend all our energy fighting</i><br>
<i>&gt; these techniques, we have a problem, too.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Steve Timm</i><br>
<p>
I think that it is important to know enough about NLP, and other methods<br>
of mind control, so that we can recognize it when someone attempts to use<br>
it on us.  The other side of the coin is that repeated exposure to<br>
anything, will in time tend to legitimize it in our minds and reading<br>
the material is to expose oneself to the arguments that attempt to<br>
legitimize it -- such as -- hypnosis is something we all do nearly every<br>
day and we just don't realize it.  So, instead of being nieve hypnotists<br>
lets become sophisticated hypnotists.<br>
<p>
Back when I was a student at Blue Mt. Academy it was popular in our<br>
academies and colleges to hold temperance orations.  But all too often<br>
the young man who won the contest with his speach on tobacco went out<br>
that night and tried his first smoke.  Or alchohol . . . . .  That is<br>
the explanation given as to why we no longer have these contests.  If<br>
indeed this is true, then spending a lot of time being negative about<br>
something, say like NLP, can actually condition our minds to be<br>
receptive to using NLP techniques on others.<br>
<p>
I think it is important to know enough about it to be able to recognize<br>
it when someone is using it on us.  But not to get too carried away with<br>
it, even in a negative way.<br>

Steve, I could not agree with you more as you related to the concept of<br>
"Majoring On Minors." Majoring on minors is an easy thing for us<br>
sometimes to fall into. I too, believe in standards and principles. I<br>
wonder if sometimes we as SDAs think that when Jesus returns that there<br>
will be 2 groups of people -- "SDAs &amp; Others." Of course as good students<br>
of scripture we know that there will be Righteous and Unrighteous at<br>
Christ's coming! [No denominationalism].<br>
<p>
In the "Journal of the Adventist Theological Society Autumn issue, 1991,<br>
Richards M Davidson has an interesting comment on Jewelry:<br>
<p>
"The Day of Atonement posture also may provide further sustantiation for<br>
the historic Adventist position regarding adornment, and in particular,<br>
the wearing of jewelry. Our church rightly has explored underlying<br>
priciples of modesty, economy, and humility. But perhaps there is an even<br>
deeper theological issue at stake. First we must correct the mistaken<br>
notion too common among many that jewelry per se is somehow 'filthy,'<br>
defiling, cheap, or bad. The Bible is plain: jewelry is beautiful. God<br>
made it. And He loves it! Before sin arose in the universe Lucifier was<br>
decked with jewels; 'every precious stone was...[his] covering;" it was<br>
beautiful, splendid, and prepared by God (Eze. 28:13). In the Old<br>
Testament God likens His salvation to the ornaments of a bride. (Isa<br>
49:18; 61:10.) At the end of the millennium the holy city will descend,<br>
'prepared as a bride adorned for her husband' (Rev. 21:2). <br>
<p>
"A primary principle then is that jewelry is beautiful and approved by<br>
God. But to this must be added another principle. From the Old Testament<br>
record it appears that in a time of corporate investigative and /or<br>
executive judgment God regularly asks His people to remove their<br>
ornaments as an outward symbol of the special judgement setting...Jews<br>
still wear no ornaments of gold on Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Judgment<br>
par excellence.<br>
<p>
"At the same time, there are latter passages that introduce a final<br>
principle. Jewelry in ancient israel, when mentioned favorably, is almost<br>
always connected with bridal ornaments. For example in the allegory of<br>
Eze. 16 God marries Israel, and then adorns her with bridal jewels."<br>
Richard Davidson goes on to say that we perhaps we do not wear jewelry<br>
today because of the judgement factor and the wedding is not yet<br>
consumated as it mentions in Rev. 19:7,8. He ends the subject by saying,<br>
This discussion call for further investigation."<br>
<p>
I thought it was an interesting concept and something the rest of the net<br>
members might like to think about.<br>

Thanks for re-instating me on SDANet.  I have comments on a couple matters.<br>
<p>
It would be wise for people to look at where the hypnotism and NLP accusation<br>
came from.  As far as we can tell, it came from some extreme right fringe of<br>
the church.  As reasonable, educated people, we usually consider the source<br>
of what we bother to listen to.  Check the accuracy rate of John Osborne,<br>
Our Firm Foundation, Pilgrim's Rest, Runner, etc.  I have just finished<br>
reading a response by Wm. Loveless to an Osborne video.  I am amazed at how<br>
terribly the facts had been misconstrued.  Sure NLP is bad, but who says the<br>
pastors are being trained in it or using it?  I have yet to meet one.  Certainlythis is not part of the seminary training.  As I understand it, when LAB I was<br>
recommended by the church, several years ago, there was no NLP or hypnotism in<br>
the program.  As the instructor changed direction to include some of these<br>
items, the SDA pastors were no longer encouraged to attend.  <br>
<p>
Perhaps it would be of interest to note that in the same accusation there was<br>
the statement that a certain book was used as a textbook on several SDA<br>
campuses.  We were told Andrews used it.  No one has ever heard of it.  No one<br>
has ever heart of such things being taught here.  Yet some people keep repeating<br>
the information without checking their facts.<br>
<p>
What the Bible itself--as opposed to Bible interpreters--says about sin:<br>
Romans 14:23:  "Whatever is not from faith is sin - hamartia."  Faith includes<br>
more than believing.  It includes trust and obedience.  Whatever is outside of<br>
that sphere is sin.<br>
<p>
Fortunately, there are verses that simplify my quandary about how much or how<br>
little is sin.  I read Jude 24, 25: "Now to Him who is able to keep you from <br>
stumbling, and to make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with <br>
great joy, to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and authority, before all time and now and forever.  Amen."<br>
<p>
God can keep me in whatever state is needed for me to reach his glory with <br>
great joy.  So what if I cannot specifically define how this happens?  Must<br>
everything be totally rational?  Have you ever tried to define being in love?<br>
<p>
Enough for today.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;I just had a thought as I have read your message David. What about</i><br>
<i>&gt;evangelists manipulating people to be baptized and join a church. Is that</i><br>
<i>&gt;wrong?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&lt;&lt;Paul&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
	I'm not David, but:<br>
	In my opinion, yes.  I think my thought is well put in Ministry<br>
of Healing, page 98 (my version).  "The theory of mind control was<br>
originated by Satan, to introduce himself as the chief worker, to put<br>
human philosophy where divine philosophy should be.  Of all the errors<br>
that are finding acceptance among professedly Christian people, none is<br>
a more dangerous deception, none more certain to separate man from God,<br>
than this."<br>
	The way I see it, if it isn't the Holy Spirit leading people to<br>
babtism, who is?  Then I would have to ask, what has any significance,<br>
babtism with water or babtism of the Holy Spirit?<br>
	I hope this isn't SOP bashing.  (I think Paul would give the<br>
same answer am.)  But it's my honest opinion that this could be the ground<br>
work which with liberty of conscience is taken away.  For if it's ok to<br>
manipulate people... isn't it ok to force people if it's supposedly for<br>
their own good?<br>
<p>
	As with all my opinions, this is subject to change as I become<br>
slightly less ignorant.<br>

# I had heard several times before that in the New Testament, there<br>
# are several very specific, but related words having to do with sin.<br>
# When Ruben Gonzalez was talking a while back about a very narrow definition<br>
# of sin (only the act), I looked this up, but the Greek concordance in <br>
# Strong's didn't tell me very much.  <br>
# <br>
# Could it be possible, given the definition of sin in the Bible, <br>
# that there are some things which are not sin, but are still wrong?<br>
# I would appreciate insight on the meaning of such words as offense,<br>
# iniquity, transgression, and sin, and the shades of meaning between them.<br>
 <br>
I'll do a little digging, Steve, and report back in a few days.<br>
<p>
One thing to keep in mind though, Paul says all things (no exceptions)<br>
are lawful, but not all things are expedient to the Faith.  So even<br>
though as Christians, we have incredible liberty in Christ (because of<br>
our baptism into His death -- we are therefore dead), we are to view<br>
everything from the perspective of how expedient to the Faith is it.<br>
<p>
I used to be very uncomfortable with this, but have come to really<br>
appreciate what gift it really is.<br>

Nancy, I appreciated your comments. You are articulating the facts very<br>
well about Lab I.<br>
<p>
A SDA member (not from our church) wanted to me read Osborne's book on the<br>
Celebration churches. He (Osborne) totally confused the whole situation<br>
with untruths. It was as though Osborne didn't even know what he was<br>
talking about. People in the area that are against Celebration churches<br>
even admitted that Osborne did not give a true picture.<br>

<i>&gt; I just had a thought as I have read your message David. What about</i><br>
<i>&gt; evangelists manipulating people to be baptized and join a church. Is</i><br>
<i>&gt; that wrong?</i><br>
<p>
It's quite all right for evangelists to make their pitch to adults.<br>
However, for children of baptism age I think much of what goes on is<br>
questionable at best.<br>
<p>
For example, I attended San Pasqual Academy starting in 1970 (age 14).<br>
I recall a Week of Prayer in which there was a Friday night altar<br>
call.  The altar call lasted two hours, and was characterized by<br>
endless repetition of the hymn "Jesus is tenderly calling" etc. and by<br>
people who had already come forward going back to recalcitrant members<br>
of the audience and urging them to come forward.  All but 12 souls out<br>
of 200-300 eventually caved in.<br>
<p>
Was God present in this gathering?  I very much doubt it.  God's<br>
system is not based on pressure.<br>

I'm intrigued by the idea of "manipulating" people to get <br>
them to be baptized and join a church.  What constitutes <br>
manipulation?  The Bible is full of examples of how people <br>
are persuaded to follow the Lord.  Here are some examples.  <br>
Do these constitute manipulation?<br>
<p>
Genesis 6.  The Lord told Noah that He was going to destroy <br>
every living thing on the face of the earth.  But if Noah <br>
would make a covenent with Him and build an ark, he and his <br>
family would be preserved.  (Do it to live. What did Noah <br>
have to lose?)<br>
<p>
In Genesis 19, we have to story of the destruction of Sodom <br>
and Gomorrah.  Lot was lingering and indecisive about whether <br>
to leave the city.  The Bible says, "While he lingered, the <br>
men (angels) laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his <br>
wife and upoin the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being <br>
merciful unto him:  and they brought him forth and set him <br>
without the city."  He was then told to "Escape for thy <br>
life."  (Lot saved against his will?)<br>
<p>
Exodus 20.  When the Lord gave the 10 commandments to Israel <br>
at Sinai, he manifested himself with thunder, lightening, <br>
noise of trumpets, and smoking mountain.  The people were <br>
extremely fearful and begged for Moses to speak to them and <br>
not God.  (Scare tactics)<br>
<p>
Joshua 24.  Joshua says to the people, "choose you this day <br>
whom ye will serve."  After they say they want to serve the <br>
Lord, he says:  "If ye forsake for Lord and serve strange <br>
gods, then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you."  <br>
(You must decide TODAY.  If you decide not to, you'll die.)<br>
<p>
I Samuel 12.  Israel demands a king so King Saul is crowned.  <br>
verse 18.  "The Lord sent thrunder and rain that day and all <br>
the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel."  (Use fear)<br>
<p>
II Chronicles 7.  The dedication of Solomon's temple.  "Fire <br>
came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and <br>
glory filled the house."  Glory was so great, the priests <br>
could not enter the temple.  When the people saw the fire and <br>
the glory of the Lord, they bowed and worshipped and praised <br>
the Lord.  (Overwhelm them.)<br>
<p>
Major and Minor Prophets of OT.  Isaiah, Jeremiah, .. all the <br>
prophets offered two basic enticements to Isreal to return to <br>
the Lord.  Return or you'll be destroyed.  Return and the <br>
Lord will bless you.<br>
<p>
Peter at Pentecost.  Peter preaches to the Jews invoking <br>
strong feelings of guilt.  Jesus Christ, "ye have taken and <br>
by wicked hands have crucified and slain."  "Pricked in their <br>
hearts".   The Holy Spirit was clearly present with <br>
manifestation of the gift of tongues which amazed the people.  <br>
(Impress them with eloquence.  Use guilt.)<br>
<p>
Saul on the Road to Damascus.  Jesus Christ manifested <br>
himself to Saul as a bright light and spoke to him audibly.  <br>
Saul "trembling and astonished".acknowledged Jesus Christ.<br>
<p>
Paul before Felix in Acts 24:25.  "And he reasoned of <br>
righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come.  Felix <br>
trembled and answered, Go thy way for this time:  When I have <br>
a convenient season I will call for thee." (Force a decision <br>
TODAY.  Use the threat of the judgment.)<br>
<p>
Paul before King Agrippa.  Pauls says, "(I) speak forth the <br>
words of truth and soberness.  For the king knoweth of these <br>
things, before who also I speak freely:  for I am persuaded <br>
that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing <br>
was not done in a corner.  King Agrippa, believest thou the <br>
prophets?  I know that thou believest.  Then Agrippa said <br>
unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.  (Use <br>
logic.  Appeal to their knowledge and intelligence.  Use <br>
persuasion.  State you KNOW they believe and that they know <br>
the truth.  Since they believe, no reason not to become a <br>
member.)<br>
<p>
So, the ways people were persuaded in the Bible are:<br>
<p>
	Focus on the rewards to be had as a member<br>
	Force them against their will<br>
	Invoke fear for their eternal well being<br>
	Overwhelm them<br>
	Impress them<br>
	Pressure them for a decision TODAY<br>
	"Hell-fire damnation" approach--the judgment is coming<br>
	Use eloquence<br>
	Invoke strong feelings of personal guilt<br>
	Don't ask IF they believe.  Say you KNOW they believe.<br>
	Use strong persuasion with unassailable logic<br>
<p>
So what do you think about this?<br>

I agree with Dan Deavours stance:  when we try to use manipulative<br>
techniques to bring people into the church we are treading on the<br>
territory of the Holy Spirit.  We had a big series in OKC by an<br>
evangelist (who is no longer in the work).  He was scheduled to come<br>
preach at our church on Sabbath a.m.  Well, time for sermon came and<br>
went and he was a no-show.  We found out later that he was closeted with<br>
some of the people from the meetings who had said they wanted to be<br>
baptized, but had backed out at the last minute (the baptism was<br>
scheduled for that afternoon).  So he was urging them to reconsider<br>
during the time he was supposed to be preaching to us.  I found that<br>
incredible!  Shouldn't joining any church be something you approach<br>
with much study and prayer?  And if you aren't sure about it, it strikes<br>
me as wise to put it off a bit longer!  These people had only attended<br>
one series of meetings and now were being labored with to take an<br>
immense step at short notice.  I don't know if NLP was involved in<br>
the negotiations or not.<br>
 <br>
Speaking of NLP -- it was a hot topic in educational research circles<br>
about ten years ago.  Lots of studies with it, none of them showing<br>
much except the ones carried out by the practitioners of the stuff<br>
themselves -- that made everyone else suspicious and it has been<br>
pretty thoroughly discredited in education now.  Still around, but not<br>
popular with the "mainline" people -- only the fringe is hanging on.<br>
 <br>
Anyway, back to the Holy Spirit...  The H.S. brings people to conviction<br>
and repentance, and I'm not sure that he/she/it needs the help of<br>
hypnosis to do it!<br>

Steve Timm: Perhaps you could send this to Dave by EMAIL. I will leave<br>
that to your discretion!! &lt;&lt;Paul&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Dan I agree with you. I know and have had experience with evangelists<br>
that have done this (manipulating) and we only live to see the evil<br>
effects of this kind of action. I cannot understand when some try to take<br>
things into their "hands." -- Why they do not allow the Holy Spirit to do<br>
its works.<br>
<p>
When I was living in Lansing, MI I had the privilege of baptizing a couple<br>
who were our neighbors. When it came down to the place for them to make a<br>
decision about being baptized and joining the church -- after I had<br>
discussed it with them, I said to them, "Why don't you pray about this and<br>
give it some more thought and you can let me know your decision later this<br>
week." This was Sunday morning and Wednesday noon the husband called me<br>
and said, "We have decided we want to be baptized and join the church." I<br>
felt that I gave the Holy Spirit an opportunity to work on their hearts.<br>
They are faithful members today after 10 years and have visited us twice<br>
since we have been in Maryland.<br>
<p>
Sad to say though this is not how is usually works with our evangelists.<br>
They put undue pressure on people for a decision and then later the people<br>
regret what they have done.<br>

To Scott: <br>
<p>
Yes Scott, Manipulating is wrong at any time in my "book." I was just<br>
throwing that concept out to see if any would bite!! Nothing grinds me<br>
more than manipulating people even for a good cause.<br>
<p>
Probably others on the net could give you a more descriptive definition of<br>
Lab 1. I will enumerate some of the concepts.<br>
<p>
1. Fogging: Agreeing with a person to try to disarm them. If a church<br>
member is being destructively critical of you. You might agree to what you<br>
can and ask them to pray for you.<br>
<p>
2. Another concept we learned that when you visit an inactive member, say<br>
for the first time, they are not going to tell you the real reason for not<br>
attending church. This happened to me a few weeks ago. What really happens<br>
is when that person feels comfortable with you and feels he has rapport<br>
with you he will confide in you the real reason.<br>
<p>
In one church where I was pastoring there was a single daughter and her<br>
mother that would never attend church. My wife and I visited them many<br>
times. When we visited them on Saturday afternoons they both in my opinion<br>
where dressed for church but stayed home. The reason given to us was the<br>
health of her mother prevented them from attending. During my stay at that<br>
church I mentored 2 ministerial interns and I would take them with me when<br>
I visited them.<br>
<p>
On one occasion, after we had finished praying, the daughter said, "Pastor<br>
Gates, do you want me to tell you the real reason for not attending<br>
church?" Then she blurted out the reason. You see, Scott, she felt<br>
comfortable in telling us now. What actually happened was when her dad was<br>
still living they had bought a house next to the church. They felt when<br>
they became elderly they would not have to worry about driving to church.<br>
<p>
Well, what happened before my time, was the present church became too<br>
small and inadequate for the congregation so they purchased another church<br>
building practically downtown. When this happened the daughter and the<br>
mother vowed they would never attend church again even though the daughter<br>
was in good health and could have driven to church.<br>
<p>
The story has a sad ending. They both were eccentric people. When other<br>
members tried to visit them they would not come to the door. When I went<br>
to visit I had not problem they also welcomed me with open arms.<br>
<p>
They never returned to church. They did not seek medical care when it was<br>
needed and relatives found them near death one day. The daughter was<br>
rushed to hospital and had inoperative cancer and died within 2 weeks. In<br>
the meantime I had been transferred to another pastorate. The daughter<br>
while in the hospital called me several times and I had prayer for her.<br>
Her request was that I have her funeral service which I did.<br>
<p>
My point of course you can see, I know. When they felt comfortable with me<br>
they were willing to express their real reason for not attending.<br>
<p>
I was counseling with a member a couple of weeks ago and he said his<br>
problem was that his daughter had betrayed his confidence in her by<br>
getting herself pregnant by her finacee. And, he simple could not cope<br>
with that experience. After a few visits I knew it was something else and<br>
talked to him further along this vein. He finally said that the thing with<br>
his daughter was just an excuse -- for his real problem was that his wife<br>
was going to school and would be soon finishing the Registered Nurse<br>
course and then she would be more educated than he was, etc.<br>
<p>
There are other concepts that I could mention. The bottom line is that<br>
Lab I just enhances your listening skills. If a person keeps talking in a<br>
certain vein if you are trained in listening skills you can pick up on<br>
things that they are saying.<br>
<p>
A person told me one time that when there neighbor's house caught on fire<br>
it took the fireman "forever" to get there. Then they related how their<br>
business had failed, and then they told me the story about their son who<br>
did not attend church any longer. What I perceived they were saying, was<br>
that no one cared. After some additional visits by me and other church<br>
members they returned to church and felt that they were really cared for.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;When Ruben Gonzalez was talking a while back about a very narrow definition</i><br>
<i>&gt;of sin (only the act), I looked this up, but the Greek concordance in </i><br>
<i>&gt;Strong's didn't tell me very much.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Could it be possible, given the definition of sin in the Bible, </i><br>
<i>&gt;that there are some things which are not sin, but are still wrong?</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would appreciate insight on the meaning of such words as offense,</i><br>
<i>&gt;iniquity, transgression, and sin, and the shades of meaning between </i><br>
<i>&gt;them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	Steve Timm</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'm not sure of what you actually understood by the definition of sin that<br>
I use. Acording to 1 John 3:4 sin is the transgression of the law<br>
and that is all sin is. Now how narrow that definition of sin becomes<br>
really is a question of how narrow one's view of the law is. The Law not only<br>
condemns wrong (physical) acts but also condemns wrong thoughts and desires<br>
which are cherished. To me the spiritual claims of the law are so vast that<br>
we can not even begin to see the level of righteousness which the law exposes.<br>
To ultimately know the claims of the law we must ultimately know God because<br>
the law is the transcript of His character. How many of us know God well enough<br>
to draw a line saying this is as far the the law goes and no further. Wherever<br>
we draw that line depends on our knowledge of God and determines what sin is<br>
to us.<br>
<p>
Again I say EGW says clearly that the ONLY definition given for sin in<br>
the bible is that of 1 John 3:4 "sin is the transgression of the law" <br>
if this is a narrow definition then fine. The definition is not my own<br>
I did not originate it, it is the inspired definition from the SoP.<br>
<p>
To answer your 2nd question. When a cat kills an inoccent sparrow, is that<br>
sin ? is it evil ? Obviously the act of a cat killing a bird is not <br>
sin because it has no moral judment and is not capable of such and so it is<br>
not sin. it will not be condemned in the judgment because it broke the law<br>
of God or acted out apart from faith. However this act is not right it is an<br>
evil act an act that comes about due to the results of sin present in this <br>
world. God does not impute sin when there is no knowledge, where there is no<br>
law there is no sin. However these evil acts to which sin is not attributed<br>
are still wrong and this is why Paul says JEsus came to reveal the law<br>
(His cahracter) to us that sin may be imputed.<br>
<p>
So that we see that we have the notion of evil or wrong acts which may or <br>
may not be sin depending on whether the perpetrator (a) is capable of moral<br>
judgment and (b) is aware of the law. This is why EGW says the closer we<br>
come to God the more sinful we see ourselves. This is because we come to<br>
know God better and therefore the claims of the law. Before we knew God<br>
as well we committed these evil acts but we were not aware that they were<br>
sinful. Sin is willful rebellion against God and His law it is an act of the<br>
will.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; It's quite all right for evangelists to make their pitch to adults.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, for children of baptism age I think much of what goes on is</i><br>
<i>&gt; questionable at best.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For example, I attended San Pasqual Academy starting in 1970 (age 14).</i><br>
<i>&gt; I recall a Week of Prayer in which there was a Friday night altar</i><br>
<i>&gt; call.  The altar call lasted two hours, and was characterized by</i><br>
<i>&gt; endless repetition of the hymn "Jesus is tenderly calling" etc. and by</i><br>
<i>&gt; people who had already come forward going back to recalcitrant members</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the audience and urging them to come forward.  All but 12 souls out</i><br>
<i>&gt; of 200-300 eventually caved in.</i><br>
<p>
I can really relate to that.  At my high school, Lilydale Adventist<br>
Academy every week of prayer they would have the high pressure altar<br>
calls.  Almost every time every student would stand up when the call<br>
came for those who wanted to give their lives to Christ to stand.  A<br>
comment from a friend typifies those calls.  He said to me, "We might<br>
as well stand, everybody else is."  And that's all it was to most of<br>
the students, I'm sure.  To this day I usually cringe when an altar<br>
call is made, especially when they're not happy with the numbers and<br>
start putting on the pressure.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Was God present in this gathering?  I very much doubt it.  God's</i><br>
<i>&gt; system is not based on pressure.</i><br>
<p>
Looking back, I'm sure that some of the people who responded were<br>
genuine, but they were lost amongst the crowds.<br>

Unfortunately the KJV totally obscures the definition of sin in 1 Jn 3:4.  <br>
The Greek uses the word "anomia" which is much closer to "lawlessness"<br>
although the term is not easy to translate.  The first letter of "anomia"<br>
shows that what follows is absent--like "amoral"--a person with no sense<br>
of morality.  The second part of the word "anomia" is a derivative of<br>
<p>
"nomos"--law.  But it refers to the general principle of law rather than<br>
to a specific law.<br>
<p>
So what constitutes sin, according to 1 Jn 3:4, is an attitude of "law-<br>
lessness," the attitude of one who defies law, acts as if it did not<br>
exist.  Such a one places his or her personal whims above law or obedience.<br>
This kind of definition is much more in harmony with Rom 14:23, where<br>
sin is whatever is not of faith.  <br>

The president of our conference lead out in an evangelistic series.<br>
A couple of the church elders at the sponsoring church approached him<br>
asking that at the alter call, that they go forward to help "prime the<br>
pump".  They were encouraged to do so.  I suspect that this is not all<br>
that uncommon.  In our church we have a retired pastoral couple.  Every<br>
single time there is an alter call -- regular church service, or<br>
evangelistic series, even calls for baptismal volunteers -- they are<br>
the first to rush forward.  I doubt they ask anyone for 'permission',<br>
they just do it.  That is a bit different from having the evangelist<br>
encourage people to help 'prime the pump'.<br>

I would like to further add that John uses yet another definition<br>
of sin.  I don't have a bible in my office (so I can't look it up), but<br>
I still remember from a 'Concurso biblico del congreso de jovenes (<br>
Youth congress, biblical contest) some 8 years ago (in Chile) that<br>
there is a verse in John that says (roughly translated from Spanish):<br>
 <br>
...to convince of sin, judgment and justice. Of since, for they don't<br>
believe in me.... (para convencerlos de pecado, juicio y justica, de<br>
pecado por cuanto no creen en mi).<br>
So, here, Jesus implies that sin is the act of not believin in<br>
Jesus.<br>
 <br>
I feel much more relief and hopeful with such a definition.<br>
 <br>

(--I ask your understanding for my using of the Spanish whenever I<br>
refer to the bible. I have always attended Spanish speaking churches<br>
and truly feel more comfortable worshiping in my mother's tongue.)<br>

The question was asked, several SDAnet posts ago, what is Lab 1.<br>
<p>
The 'inventers' of NLP have developed a series of seminars/classes<br>
that span several labs.  What is taught depends a whole lot upon<br>
the instructor.   Many Lab 1 instructors have felt very uncomfortable<br>
about the NLP material they were taught and so what they teach in<br>
Lab 1 is considerably watered down from what the class might be if<br>
taught by the authors of the program, or more enthusiastic advocates<br>
of the material.  An typical SDA Lab 1 would be a lot different from a <br>
xxxxx church Lab 1.  So, Lab 1 can range all overn the map, depending<br>
on the instructor and his/her scruples.  Lab 2, ect, are much more likely<br>
to get into real NLP material.  Hence the frequent protests that<br>
hey, "I took Lab 1 and there was nothing wrong with it".  Tell me,<br>
would you drink water that came from an arsenic tainted spring, or<br>
industrial wastes contaminated well, if the guy selling the water<br>
insisted that the water had been run through a special filter to take<br>
out the poison?  And to prove it he drinks down a glass full.<br>
<p>
Psychologists say that nobody can be hypnotised if they don't want<br>
to be hypnotised.  That is what they used to say about old style<br>
classical hypnosis.  That is the supposed 'beauty' of NLP, that<br>
more people become vulnerable to manipulation because they don't<br>
know what is happening to them.  You are not nearly as vulnerable<br>
if you can recognize the techniques potentially being used on you.<br>
<p>
And, there are so many sources of pure water, why go to a sourse of<br>
poison water that has been supposedly purified and made fit for the<br>
church and its leadership and members?<br>

The verse you are thinking about is John 16:9.  The Couselor or comforter<br>
will convince people of their sin, not believing in Christ.<br>

  What is an 'alter call' and what is it used for and what part does it<br>
play in normal/special Sabbath services?<br>
<p>
  Thanks.<br>

<p>
<p>
[I suspect that an "alter call" is a call for people to alter their lives!<br>
More commonly seen is the altar call, which works in the SDA church about<br>
the same as it would in any Protestant denomination although there is nothing<br>
in an SDA church which can be considered an altar per se.<br>
It generally involves asking people to make a public committment for <br>
Christ by coming to the front of the church.  It may involve an expression<br>
of the desire for baptism, or it may not.<br>
<p>
Some SDA churches (particularly the Black churches) will have an altar call<br>
almost every Sabbath.  At the Elmhurst church where I attend, there hasn't<br>
been one since I started attending.  Altar calls are more commonly seen <br>
at evangelistic meetings such as the one referred to above, which are <br>
generally not held during the Sabbath worship service.  SCT]<br>

Today I talked with Doug Kilcher who took Lab I and II several years ago.  He<br>
told me that the basis for these workshops was a piece of information found<br>
in church research: if a person misses church for six weeks in a row, it will<br>
be next to impossible to win that person back to church.  John Savage took<br>
this information and designed a workshop to teach church workers how to deal<br>
with people in such a way as to win them back before the deadline.  His<br>
emphasis was on listening and visitation skills.  The workshop participants<br>
were taught to listen to what the almost-former church member had to say with<br>
total empathy and respond non-defensively.  A lot of emphasis was put on<br>
listening to what the person did not really say but suggested.<br>
 <br>
LAB I and LAB II were two levels dealing with the save topic.<br>
 <br>
John Savage broadened his interests.  He began offering workshops in conflict<br>
management.  About three years ago he began doing workshops on NLP at four<br>
different levels.  He includes auto-suggestion, self-hypnosis, patterning, and<br>
audio hypnosis in these workshops, which are not the church-oriented Lab I<br>
workshops.<br>
 <br>
The only mention of NLP in the LAB materials is found on p.44 of the workbook.<br>
I transcribe the whole page.<br>
Neuro-linguistic Programming<br>
Verbal Accessing Cues<br>
Definition: Listening for and responding in the dominant mode of the speaker<br>
language.<br>
 <br>
Clue words:<br>
VISUAL: bright, clear/vague, envision, examine, focus, imagine, inspect, look,<br>
observe, perspective, picture, viewpoint, visualize, witness<br>
AUDITORY: amplify, ask, call, click, harmonize, hear, listen, loud/quiet,<br>
overhear, question, shout/whisper, speak, talk, tell<br>
KINESTHETIC: cool/warm, feel fresh, grasp, handle, hold, link, rough/smooth,<br>
smell, solid, struggle, sweet/sour, taste, touch<br>
UNSPECIFIED: aware, be, believe, consider, contemplate, know, learn, ponder,<br>
remember, respectful, sense, think, trusting, understand<br>
 <br>
Additional Notes:<br>
VISUAL:<br>
 <br>
AUDITORY:<br>
 <br>
KINESTHETIC<br>
 <br>
Practicae Exercise:<br>
1. "I would like to hear about your church.  Tell me about it."<br>
2.  "How do you see your church ten years from now?"<br>
3.  "Can you share the most rewarding experience you have had this year?"<br>
 <br>
After reading the page I told Doug I was not sure what all this meant.  He<br>
told me that Savage taught that people "spoke" in different "languages"<br>
because people think and feel differently.  A person who is "visual" speaks<br>
using "visual" terms.  If one interacts with that person using "visual"<br>
terms, the person opens up and responds better.  Likewise, some people operate<br>
on an auditory basis. You find that out by listening for the clue words.  If<br>
you think a person is auditory, you use auditory language in dealing with him<br>
or her.<br>
 <br>
In Savage's workbook for LAB there is one book on NLP:<br>
Bandler, Richard, and John Grinder.  Frogs into Princes: Neuro Linguistic<br>
Programming.  Utah: Real People Press, 1979.<br>
 <br>
Doug also told me that whereas LAB I used to be highly recommended as an<br>
activity of the seminary's 9th quarter, it no longer is part of the program.<br>
 <br>
Having come to the end of my information, I'll close my posting.<br>

Lola, thanks for your comments on manipulating, etc. I think the basic<br>
premise with people that do that kind of stuff, is that if they do not<br>
"strike when the iron is hot" they may lose that person and they will not<br>
be baptized. I do not agree with that philosophy but I know some use that<br>
as an excuse for their actions.<br>
<p>
I could tell you some horror stories but do not know if I should!!<br>

I just want to add one comment. I understand what you are saying about Lab<br>
1. However, I took Lab 1 in 1984 or 1985 and the instructor was an SDA<br>
pastor and I do not think there was any NLP going on then with the<br>
seminar.<br>

To Glen McCloskey<br>
<p>
Glen, I hate to hear horror stories about long altar calls etc. I may<br>
leave myself open for some criticism by some but anyway here goes.<br>
<p>
Usually I use a card for people to fill in and make their choice and then<br>
I visit with them either after the service or at their home. I really<br>
believe it is a sweet experience to have a person make their decision in<br>
their home -- may I say, in the privacy of their home. As I have said in<br>
other messages, I further believe that we should allow the person to make<br>
that decision on their own. We have a congregation in some cities of<br>
people who have been baptized under pressure and then never come back to<br>
church. Then the pastor has to deal with those people for years on end.<br>

	1 John 3:4 reads literally, I believe, ``Whoever sins commits<br>
lawlessness, for sin is lawlessness.''  The Greek word used for<br>
lawlessness is anomia.  This verse shows that sin is an act, a<br>
commission of lawlessness.  Even in English, to say someone is<br>
lawless, or an outlaw, signifies that the person is a law breaker.<br>
Romans 7 gives a similar thought, ``I had not known sin, but by the<br>
law; for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not<br>
covet.''  Therefore, the King James rendering, ``Sin is the<br>
transgression of the law,'' rightly expresses the sense of 1 John 3:4.<br>
Sin is the transgression of the law of God, expressed in the Ten<br>
Commandments, which contain the commandment ``Thou shalt not covet.''<br>
Of course, the law is fulfilled by love, and Jesus gave the two great<br>
commandments, love to God and love to man, as summarizing the law.<br>
<p>
	This thought, that sin is the transgression of the law, has<br>
been contained in numerous evangelistic meetings and Bible studies<br>
that I have seen, not to mention sermons and the writings of Ellen<br>
White.  Of course, the Bible testimony is primary.  But it's not an<br>
idea I dreamed up.  This is a key thought for helping people to see<br>
that Sabbath breaking is sin, since it is a violation of the fourth<br>
commandment.  Of course, it is only a faith relationship with Christ<br>
that enables us to keep the law.  Whatever is not of faith is sin,<br>
because whatever is done out of Christ is basically selfish and in<br>
conflict with the law of love expressed by the Ten Commandments.  I<br>
don't see any benefit or Bible justification for giving up the<br>
teaching that sin is the transgression of the law.  If I am wrong, I'm<br>
sure someone will point that out to me.<br>

Dr. Loveless is the senior pastor at Loma Linda.  He has also been<br>
offering pastoral seminars in new meditative forms of prayer.  Those<br>
who are familiar with eastern meditative styes have objected.  One<br>
person, doing a study of the Jesuits and their founder Ignatious<br>
Loyola, found a remarkable parallel between the script that Loveless<br>
was following with his ministerial seminars and what Loyola put his<br>
Jesuits through.  Then more recently Dr. Loveless started offering<br>
hand outs of his methodology of prayer and meditation.  About half<br>
way down his included Bibliography is Loyola's book in which is documented<br>
much the same material.   I have relatives at Loma Linda who say he<br>
prefers not to use the pulpit, prefering at times to simply sit on<br>
the floor during his sermons.<br>
<p>
Does anyone out there know anything about Dr. Loveless?<br>
<p>
Dave<br>
<p>
[Please, some of the silent majority from LLU, LSU, or CUC (where he <br>
was before, speak up!  I am also echoing this post to SDA-L because they <br>
have a lot more coverage in California, so some of you will get it twice.<br>
We want the facts.  SCT]<br>

	I have been sitting back for the past year or so, reading the many<br>
posts which appear.  I rearly write, but I am in somewhat of a delema.<br>
	As far back as I can remember, I have always wanted to be one of two<br>
things: a minister of the Adventist church or an engineer.  In 1986, I <br>
entered college, thinking I had finally made my choice, as a Theology major.   <br>
I went throught the typical classes that were required until my junior year<br>
and then began having doubts.  The summer prior to my junior year I worked as<br>
an associate pastor in Guyana, South America.  I suppose it was then that I<br>
actually saw what ministering was all about.  I realized it was more than<br>
the preaching and the "performance" that the church saw on Sabbath.  Needless<br>
to say I was afraid of the "real ministry" which was revealed.<br>
	During the spring quarter of my junior year, I changed my major to<br>
Computer Science.  I finished in May of 1991 and am presently a Ph.D<br>
student at the University of Alabama.  I am doing fine in my classes, but<br>
I'm having doubts again.  Many of my friends are telling me that I am<br>
acting like a modern Jonah. Could that be true? <br>

There are countries around the world that do not accept any "missionaries".<br>
The GC offers a placement service for those with technical qualificaitions<br>
willing to be part time as missionaries.  To illustrate -- you could work<br>
for IBM in some country open to IBM but not to missionaries, with the<br>
understanding from IBM that you get to take time off from time to time<br>
to hold an evangelistic series or  . . . . . . . .<br>
I forget the name of the placement service, but you could contact AVSC<br>
(Adventist Volunteer Service Corp)  perhaps they are the ones.  AVSC<br>
seems to be more for retired folks willing to help out around the world<br>
where room and board are provided but not transportation and other<br>
expenses.<br>

Jonah was running away from God as much as from Niniveh.  You could only<br>
be a Jonah if you try to ignore the God-given task of all Christians.<br>
<p>
I love two short quotations from Ellen White: "Every true disciple is born into<br>
the kingdom of God as a missionary.  He who drinks the living water becomes a fountain of life.  The receiver becomes a giver." (DA 195)<br>
<p>
"Here was a work for them to do--go to a heathen home and tell of the blessing<br>
they had received from Jesus.... In doing this work they could receive a <br>
greater blessing than if, merely for benefit to themselves, they had remained in<br>
His presence.  It is in working to spread the good news of salvation that we<br>
are brought near to the Saviour" (DA 339-340)<br>
<p>
My experience of teaching students who want to be pastors suggests to me that<br>
many of them misunderstand their calling.  All laypeople have the duty of<br>
sharing and being missionaries.  Not all people are called to minister.  The<br>
work that a consecrated lay person can do may be far greater than what a<br>
minister can accomplish.<br>
<p>
I'm all for laypeople sharing their joy and faith--outside the church.  On<br>
the other hand, when the Lord lets a person know clearly that he or she<br>
should be a full-time pastor, that person will have to deal with conse-<br>
quences of being a Jonah.  <br>
<p>
As an SDA in a non-Christian environment, you have a marvelous opportunity.<br>
As you give, you will receive.  Don't let people talk you into receiving <br>
and receiving and receiving before you give.  Yes, you have to have something<br>
to give, but as soon as you start giving, you'll find yourself receiving.<br>
<p>
God bless you!<br>
<p>

I bought Alden Thompson's book _Inspiration_ when the bookmobile was<br>
around a weekend ago.  So far I doubt find anything too startling (I'm<br>
halfway through with it), but then perhaps I am not considered very<br>
conservative.  (Oops, in the above sentence "doubt" was supposed to be<br>
"don't".)  What was interesting to me was that at our winter camp<br>
meeting here in the Kentucky Tennessee conference the invited speaker<br>
was Raymond Holmes from Andrews, who spoke on the topic of inspiration!<br>
He was speaking about the Bible and Ellen White, and using EGW to<br>
bolster his interpretation of Biblical inspiration.  This seems to me to<br>
be entirely backwards -- shouldn't we use the Bible instead to decide<br>
whether EGW was inspired?  Anyway, someone asked him his opinion of the<br>
Holmes book and he would not answer because he was being taped!  That is<br>
what "inspired" me to buy the book....  I find Thompson very practical<br>
and clear -- he's probably an excellent teacher.  Some of the stuff he<br>
quotes his students as saying remind me of myself in college when one<br>
professor merely suggested that the story of Jonah or Job was not<br>
literally true in every detail.  I was completely shocked!<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
1 Jn 3:4 does use the word anomia.  Lawlessness is one translation of the word.<br>
Another might be contempt of law.  The verb poieo, to do or make does not <br>
necessarily mean to perform an action, although that is an important trans<br>
lation.  In Greek trees make fruit--Matt 3:10; 7:17-19; Jesus makes his <br>
disciples fishers of men--Matt 4:19; and the believer does the will of God--<br>
Matt 12:50; Jesus tells the disciples to do his words, meaning far more than<br>
committing certain acts.<br>
<p>
Sin is the commission of acts forbidden by the Ten Commandments.  That is a<br>
good definition.  But it is partial.  Unfortunately, behind every sinful act is<br>
a sinful thought coming from a sinful heart.  So Mk 7:20-23. <br>
<p>
If some of you have access to The Illustrated Bible Dictionary, look up the<br>
article on "SIN."  I find it excellent.  <br>
<p>
Yours for the solution of the sin problem--Christ the Saviour...<br>
<p>
Nancy<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	1 John 3:4 reads literally, I believe, ``Whoever sins commits</i><br>
<i>&gt; lawlessness, for sin is lawlessness.''  The Greek word used for</i><br>
<i>&gt; lawlessness is anomia.  This verse shows that sin is an act, a</i><br>
<i>&gt; commission of lawlessness.  Even in English, to say someone is</i><br>
<i>&gt; lawless, or an outlaw, signifies that the person is a law breaker.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Romans 7 gives a similar thought, ``I had not known sin, but by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; law; for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not</i><br>
<i>&gt; covet.''  Therefore, the King James rendering, ``Sin is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; transgression of the law,'' rightly expresses the sense of 1 John 3:4.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sin is the transgression of the law of God, expressed in the Ten</i><br>
<i>&gt; Commandments, which contain the commandment ``Thou shalt not covet.''</i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course, the law is fulfilled by love, and Jesus gave the two great</i><br>
<i>&gt; commandments, love to God and love to man, as summarizing the law.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	This thought, that sin is the transgression of the law, has</i><br>
<i>&gt; been contained in numerous evangelistic meetings and Bible studies</i><br>
<i>&gt; that I have seen, not to mention sermons and the writings of Ellen</i><br>
<i>&gt; White.  Of course, the Bible testimony is primary.  But it's not an</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea I dreamed up.  This is a key thought for helping people to see</i><br>
<i>&gt; that Sabbath breaking is sin, since it is a violation of the fourth</i><br>
<i>&gt; commandment.  Of course, it is only a faith relationship with Christ</i><br>
<i>&gt; that enables us to keep the law.  Whatever is not of faith is sin,</i><br>
<i>&gt; because whatever is done out of Christ is basically selfish and in</i><br>
<i>&gt; conflict with the law of love expressed by the Ten Commandments.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't see any benefit or Bible justification for giving up the</i><br>
<i>&gt; teaching that sin is the transgression of the law.  If I am wrong, I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; sure someone will point that out to me.</i><br>

David raised some very important points in his article about <br>
protestant and catholic viewpoints.  I'd like to amplify his point <br>
regarding especially views of authority.  Some people may think that <br>
people who subscribe to the Catholic view as portrayed by the Great<br>
Controversy are few and far between.  If you read the Usenet news, you <br>
know that is not true--they are all over the place, decrying everything<br>
from Vatican II to religious freedom, defending the Inquisition as a good<br>
thing.  <br>
<p>
One thing that irritates such people more than most is the posting<br>
of Catholic-leaning Episcopalians.  Such a person could be defending a <br>
Catholic view on the Apocrypha or Mary, and the Catholics will still <br>
flame her.  The message is that if you don't recognize that the Church<br>
has the final authority, nothing else matters.  On the other hand,<br>
my pro-choice, pro-communist, pro gay rights feminist friend in S. Africa<br>
considers herself a good Catholic, and her priest doesn't disagree.<br>
<p>
Definitely some Catholic interpretations of authority are used in our <br>
church, both by the independent ministries and the church leadership.<br>
In fact, even the liberal movement within the SDA church could be seen<br>
as an attempt as rejection of that kind of authority.  I have posted<br>
examples of various "gems" from the Michigan Conference office, who <br>
decry the mis-compilation of Ellen G. White quotes with compilations <br>
that are worse than the ones they decry.  (So far the administration<br>
has been blissfully unaware of *this* independent ministry, despite <br>
my best attempts to let them know.)<br>
<p>
I am slightly worried by the lumping of unity into the Catholic<br>
characteristics, and saying that the individual conscience is predominant<br>
over church and state.  I suspect this idea is foreign in many cultures,<br>
be they catholic or protestant.  We cannot neglect that at Pentecost the <br>
Holy Spirit was given to a church in one accord, not just because 120<br>
people "had a personal relationship".  I do not claim that unity should <br>
be gained by "shut up and follow the leadership" but it nevertheless can <br>
and must be attained, and it is a proper goal for Protestants to follow.<br>
In such a group reached by mutual consent, the good of the group will <br>
indeed dominate the good of the individual.<br>
.<br>
So we see that unity is not necessarily catholic, but it is by nature<br>
communist.  Since heaven is a communist place, and we follow a group <br>
of early church leaders who were communist,  it's not bad company to be in.<br>

I sympathize with you.  I am now a cs faculty and enjoy it.  But,<br>
witnessing etc. also has a strong appeal.  I would stay in CS for<br>
a while since you already tried ministry.  If it doesn't work out<br>
you can go back.  What doubts are you having about CS?<br>
<p>
Most of the people in my social group are in service related fields and<br>
I suppose associating with them is allowing me to see why I originally<br>
wanted to become a minister.  Also, I'm in the process of planning my <br>
wedding (June 28, 1992), my fiance is a first year medical student.  We<br>
talk frequently about the future and the only thing in service related,<br>
in  my mind about computer science is teaching.  Although teaching is <br>
something I could see myself doing, I don't want to teach immediately<br>
after finishing.  <br>
<p>
Recently I became an elder in a local congregation.  I find it very  <br>
refreshing after sitting at a terminal all week.  Being active again<br>
has renewed my interest for pastoral ministry.<br>
<p>
[This came to me from Dwain Woode, but from what I know of his situation<br>
it can't be his voice.  It's probably a personal reply that someone sent<br>
to him.  Dwain, can you clarify?  SCT]<br>

My recent/current experience in the missionary/computer science arena<br>
may be of interest here.<br>
 <br>
 From 1987-89, my wife had a deferred medical missionary appointment to<br>
Taiwan Adventist Hospital.  Then, overnite, the Taiwan govt made significant<br>
changes in the rules allowing foreign doctors to work in Taiwan--essentially<br>
requiring her to write medical boards in Chinese.<br>
 <br>
So, she was reappointed to Penang Adventist Hospital in Penang, Malaysia.<br>
She finished her residency in June, 1990, and the hospital started on the visa<br>
application process.  In February, '91 she accepted a temporary appointment<br>
to Guam SDA Clinic pending licensure/visa approval in Malaysia.  On Nov. 1,'91<br>
she accepted a permanent position on Guam, after waiting 15 months for<br>
Malaysia to work out.<br>
<p>
On my part, I finished my PhD in CS in June, '91.  I had solid job offers<br>
for both university/commercial opportunities in Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore,<br>
and now Guam.  None of the prospective employers could envision any trouble<br>
getting me a visa, in part because no licensure was involved.  Also, CS folks<br>
are in sufficient demand that red tape sometimes can be avoided.<br>
<p>
I'm teaching part-time this semester as a lead-in to a tenure-track position]<br>
next fall at the University of Guam.  It's not as fancy as National Taiwan U<br>
or National Univ of Singapore or even Universiti Sains Malaysia, but it<br>
is a university...<br>
<p>
As the world matures, especially the second/third world, the "magic" of<br>
being a teacher/preacher/doctor wears a bit thin.  Perhaps its time for<br>
the left hand of the Message to grab hold and shake the world.<br>

<p>
<i>&gt; I am slightly worried by the lumping of unity into the Catholic</i><br>
<i>&gt; characteristics, and saying that the individual conscience is predominant</i><br>
<i>&gt; over church and state.  I suspect this idea is foreign in many cultures,</i><br>
<i>&gt; be they catholic or protestant.  We cannot neglect that at Pentecost the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Holy Spirit was given to a church in one accord, not just because 120</i><br>
<i>&gt; people "had a personal relationship".  I do not claim that unity should </i><br>
<i>&gt; be gained by "shut up and follow the leadership" but it nevertheless can </i><br>
<i>&gt; and must be attained, and it is a proper goal for Protestants to follow.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In such a group reached by mutual consent, the good of the group will </i><br>
<i>&gt; indeed dominate the good of the individual.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; . . . . .</i><br>
<p>
This reminds me of an email dialog that grew out of something I posted<br>
on s.r.c.  The other side of the email was a young man from the south,<br>
a member of a Protestant church, I thought perhaps Baptist, but he was<br>
not Baptist.  He spoke of the need for unity as if that was something<br>
to be prophetically expected.  That there is an expectation that<br>
perhaps the Pope is the only one who is capable of bringing about this<br>
unity and so many Protestants are praying for the success of the Pope.<br>
I asked him if he had any prophetic texts to support his expectation.<br>
While he sees that it is prophetic that there shall be unity he can<br>
offer no scriptural prophecies.  His response was that thousands, perhaps<br>
millions of folks in the south are praying for unity, how can God deny<br>
these thousands and thousands of prayers.  I pointed out that Bible<br>
prophecy does not fortell any such unity.  That prophecy does tell us<br>
about unity under the Papacy -- the wondering after the beast.  But to<br>
pray for such unity is to pray for Ishmaal and not Isaac.<br>
<p>
There seems to be a lot of missunderstanding about what Ellen White<br>
meant when she said that the church will go through.  The legal system<br>
has been defining that a "church" is not the bricks plus the<br>
establishment of leadership, it not really the visible obvious church.<br>
Rather a "church" is a system of belief and those who subscribe to it.<br>
Let us say that another war springs up with a draft for soldiers.  Lets<br>
say you are drafted and ordered to bear arms and work on the Sabbath.<br>
Certain precidents have occured, with JWs for example, that make it<br>
likely that a judge hearing your case will set asside the fact that you<br>
happen to be a card carrying member of the SDA church.  You will have<br>
to stand up for what you personally believe and be able to prove that<br>
it is your personal belief and not simply something you do out of peer<br>
preassure or the popular preassures of church/social membership.  The<br>
legal system is no longer interrested in supporting you in terms of<br>
the doctrines of your church.  Only if you can convince the court that<br>
it is your personal honest conviction will the court be responsive.<br>
Mere belief is not enough.  Mere church doctrine is not enough.  It must<br>
be real conviction on your part.<br>
<p>
My mother was born the year EGW died.  Through her mom, a past friend<br>
of EGW, my mother is acquainted with some of Ellen White's later years<br>
un-published visions.  Others than my mom are also acquainted with the<br>
same and similar visions.  Example - a vision of the church as a stage<br>
coach going through with the leadership at the reins.  But then her<br>
attention is taken elsewhere for awhile.  When the vision returns to<br>
the scene of the stage coach she is startled to see that the leadership<br>
are no longer at the reins.  It looks like the end for the church, but<br>
then it is the laymen who pick up the reins and the church does go<br>
through to the end.  Back to legal precident.  The church is a belief<br>
system and those who honestly believe in it.  The church is not the<br>
bricks and the established leadership, unless of course they are honest<br>
subscibers to the belief system.  The church going through that EGW was<br>
talking about is the belief system as she knew it and there are those<br>
who do indeed subscribe to it eagerly, even with a conviction.<br>
<p>
Does a call for unity imply a call to rally under the present leadership<br>
that does not necessarily subscribe to the beliefs of SDA?  Are there<br>
Bible texts that call for such unity?  No.  Are we to pray for such an<br>
Ishmael? No!  Let us rather pray that the members of our church pursue<br>
a course a diligent Bible study and S.O.P. with urgent prayers that the<br>
Holy Spirit guide us into a knowledge of what is really the truth.<br>
While the Bible does call upon us to love our neighbor, even those who<br>
hate us and despitefully use us; I do not see the Bible prophecying that<br>
unity be a prime object of our prayers.  Those who hold high the banner<br>
of unity are all too often wondering after the beast.  That is<br>
especially so outside the SDA church.  But there is also a strong move<br>
for the ecumenical within our church.  Such ecumenicism is not "the<br>
church going through" that EGW prophcied.  Rather it is the church in<br>
great peril on its way through the time of the end.<br>
<p>
No, I do not pray for unity.  There will be for a time a unity of<br>
wondering after the beast.  That I do not pray for.  Rather I pray that<br>
our people will get back to basics found in really diligent Bible study<br>
and S.O.P.  I do believe the Bible must authenticate EGW and not the<br>
other way around.  I do find her to be authenticated and her writings<br>
fit for study for these times.  We are in the time of the end, the<br>
final hours, which will be rapid ones.  In the news we find the pace<br>
is clearly picking up.<br>

SDAnetters,<br>
<p>
I was browsing some reference books in the Univ. library this evening and<br>
found some interesting statistics about religions in the U.S.  Nothing<br>
earth-shaking here but something that might be interesting when we watch<br>
the political tone of the coming elections based on regions and states.<br>
This comes for the book, "THE NEW BOOK OF AMERICAN RANKINGS" published in<br>
1984 by Facts on File Inc.  These religion rankings were taken from the<br>
"Report from Churches and Church Membership in the US 1980".  The report<br>
ranks each state according the percent of population for that organized<br>
religion.  The "US average" is the average percent of that religion over<br>
the 50 states.<br>
<p>
	Catholic<br>
		21% US average<br>
		Rank #1 - Rhode Island - 63.7% of population<br>
		Rank #2 - Massachusetts - 53.0%<br>
<p>
	Methodist<br>
		5.1% US average<br>
		Rank #1 - West Virginia - 11.3%<br>
		Rank #2 - Kansas - 11.1%<br>
<p>
	Baptist<br>
		8% US average<br>
		Rank #1 - Alabama - 30.4%<br>
		Rank #2 - Mississippi - 30.2%<br>
<p>
	Presbyterians<br>
		1.8% US average<br>
		Rank #1 - Pennsylvania - 4%<br>
		Rank #2 - Nebraska - 3.7%<br>
<p>
	Lutherans<br>
		3.6% US average<br>
		Rank #1 - North Dakota - 31.9%<br>
		Rank #2 - Minnesota - 26.0%<br>
<p>
	Jewish<br>
		2.6% US average<br>
		Rank #1 - New York - 12.2%<br>
		Rank #2 - California - 3.2%<br>
<p>
	Mormon<br>
		1.2% US average<br>
		Rank #1 - Utah - 67.4%<br>
		Rank #2 - Idaho - 25.5%<br>
<p>
	Seventh-day Adventist<br>
		0.3% US average<br>
		Rank #1 - Oregon - 1.2%<br>
		Rank #2 - Washington - 0.8%<br>
<p>
Some of this didn't surprise me at all.  However, it is interesting to<br>
note that the highest concentration of SDAs is in OREGON.  I didn't<br>
expect that at all.  Also, the fact that the state average percent of<br>
Roman Catholics at 21% should be considered significant.<br>
<p>
One other interesting note.  This book said that Seventh-day Adventists<br>
are "Fundamentalist Pentecostal Protestants."  Although SDAs deny that<br>
they are "pentecostal", the real world thinks SDAs ARE!  I wonder what<br>
this is based on.  I would venture that as more "Celebration Churches"<br>
form, this opinion will get stronger among outsiders.<br>

[Some of us will also deny that we are fundamentalist.  As I remember,<br>
1 in 12 people in the county that includes Portland, OR is SDA.  This is <br>
the highest in the country, dwarfing such places as Berrien county , MI<br>
(1 in 60).  SCT]<br>

I don't want to detract from David Buxton's points about unity.  I agree<br>
that we should watch for trends about which way is the crowd going, and <br>
then consider going the opposite way.  The kingdom of Christ has no<br>
communion with the kingdom of Satan, to follow the ecumenical movement<br>
as it exists today we cannot and should not agree.<br>
<p>
Having said this,  I wish to make a few points on unity which he does not <br>
consider.  I would not be surprised if we someday find, as he related the <br>
vision, that the leadership is no longer at the reins.   If there is a group<br>
of lay people prepared to assume the reins at that time, it will be because<br>
they are well grounded in the truth and ready to share the love of<br>
Christ, and ready to receive the power of the Holy Spirit in the latter<br>
rain.<br>
So when I speak of unity, I speak of unity within the remnant, not <br>
unity with the world.  This type of unity must have as its base a proactive<br>
love for Christ, not a reactive fighting of some group external or<br>
internal to the Church organization.<br>
<p>
As for the leadership losing the reins, this is to some extent already<br>
happening.  I believe already that a splinter group is forming which<br>
will swear to all of the 27 Fundamental Beliefs but swear at everyone<br>
else, being totally ignorant about how Christ's love affects the<br>
practical life.   Another splinter group is forming which will emphasize<br>
love at the cost to doctrine.  The leadership may follow this group, or<br>
collapse under its own weight.  So we could be faced with a 3-way tug of<br>
war in which none <br>
of the sides is right.  This is where the few faithful ones will come to the<br>
fore as David says.   If we were to look closely, we would find they are <br>
at the reins even now.<br>
<p>
On the other side, we should not expect from spiritual Babylon a greater<br>
degree of unity than we ourselves can muster.   Remember how it was in<br>
the <br>
days of Christ.  The Pharisees and Sadducees hated Jesus for the very reasons<br>
they hated each other.  But they were able to cooperate to get rid of him.<br>
Satan's kingdom is divided against itself, and cannot stand.  It is a<br>
place of confusion.  People may agree on an action for opposing reasons.<br>
Those who have seen God's love in action, as Christ showed it, will<br>
either accept it and be changed by it, or reject it and try to destroy<br>
it.  The fact that our church is not the object of hate or persecution<br>
today should be a signal to us that we are not yet showing this<br>
incontrovertible love.<br>
<p>
Finally, what the Bible has to say about unity.<br>
John 17:11  "And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the<br>
world, and I come to thee.  Holy Father, keep through thine own name<br>
those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.<br>
John 17:22  "And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that<br>
they may be one, even as we are one."<br>
John 17:23 "I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one;<br>
and the world may know that thou has sent me, and hast loved them, as<br>
thou has loved me.<br>
Acts 2:1  "And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all<br>
with one accord in one place."<br>
Acts 2:46  "And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple,<br>
and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness<br>
and singleness of heart."<br>
Acts 4:32  "And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart<br>
and of one soul..."<br>
Ephesians 4:13  "Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the<br>
knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the<br>
stature of the fullness of Christ.<br>
<p>
I don't say that any of these verses ar a prophecy of ecumenical unity<br>
to come.  But they do stress its importance.<br>

Dr. Loveless is the senior pastor at Loma Linda.  He has also been<br>
offering pastoral seminars in new meditative forms of prayer.  Those<br>
who are familiar with eastern meditative styes have objected.  One<br>
person, doing a study of the Jesuits and their founder Ignatious<br>
Loyola, found a remarkable parallel between the script that Loveless<br>
was following with his ministerial seminars and what Loyola put his<br>
Jesuits through.  Then more recently Dr. Loveless started offering<br>
hand outs of his methodology of prayer and meditation.  About half<br>
way down his included Bibliography is Loyola's book in which is documented<br>
much the same material.   I have relatives at Loma Linda who say he<br>
prefers not to use the pulpit, prefering at times to simply sit on<br>
the floor during his sermons.<br>
 <br>
Does anyone out there know anything about Dr. Loveless?<br>
 <br>
Dave<br>
 <br>
[Please, some of the silent majority from LLU, LSU, or CUC (where he<br>
was before, speak up!  I am also echoing this post to SDA-L because they<br>
have a lot more coverage in California, so some of you will get it twice.<br>
We want the facts.  SCT]<br>

The recent weeks have been somewhat troublesome and find myself at odds<br>
with my church.   The anger and doubt that I have been experiencing I <br>
believe is maybe no different than that others have experienced. <br>
So, in my search for resolve to several issues I thought I would break my<br>
silent watch on the net and seek some feedback.<br>
<p>
Let me start with a story.  I have a new friend.  He is a non-Adventist<br>
and has been attending church with me for several weeks.  He first <br>
learned of our church through a mutual Adventist friend whom he works<br>
with.  Over the time we have known each other he has developed a <br>
distinct impression that our church is filled with rules.  The rules <br>
obviously make no sense to him and seem to have no logical basis.<br>
I am saddened that I have been unable to saticfactorily answer his<br>
questions and that much of what I do does seem more of a habit or<br>
way of life than within religous conviction.<br>
<p>
I am also saddened as I am asked to explain some of the inconsistencies<br>
within my church.  For example:  Our mutual friend.... wears jewelry,<br>
I do not....she goes out to lunch on Sabbath... I do not...  she herself<br>
is in real disbelief and trust of the Adventist motives and<br>
practices.  <br>
<p>
As I look at my present situation I look back and am frustrated with <br>
the way I was raised, protected if you will, within the Adventist environment.<br>
(SDA schools since 4th grade... all the way through college.... worked<br>
for adventist hospitals, camps and campus jobs, even spent a year as<br>
an SDA missionary......yep.... I am a product of the Adventist system!)<br>
The subculture as I call it, has kept me within its confines and I<br>
have been unable to make friends outside the church for most of my<br>
life.  Now as l do so... I feel inept,  unable to communicate,  and odd.<br>
<p>
Am I a product of the age in which I live?  <br>
As I look around at those in my age group.... 20's....very few are <br>
deeply commited christians...As far as that goes I look at the adults<br>
and find few role models. Am I looking for an excuse to be like the crowd?<br>
<p>
Interestingly, I picked up the recent issue of the Adventist Review and<br>
noted the new AnchorPoint Series which seems to be addressing just such issues<br>
as I face.  Roy Adams states "The greatest threat facing our church<br>
today is the emergence of a generation of Adventists held together by <br>
culture rather than conviction; a generation that has not made its own<br>
the message that moved the Founding Fathers and Mothers; a generation of<br>
young Adventists that has lost the sense of our uniqueness as a people."<br>
<p>
So it seems there are several issues here.  First are my questions and doubts.<br>
How can I deal with these and grow from the situation without rejecting<br>
the truth?  without placing myself on dangerous ground in the meantime?<br>
How can I know the culture from the important issues when I have parents<br>
and church patriarches telling me what I've heard already for 26 years?<br>
Sometimes I feel like I'm playing with the devil and he's having a good<br>
time with me.  And Yet I feel as if I must come to grips with the <br>
many "why's" I am now faced with.<br>
<p>
I want to know how to live in the world and still be an<br>
Adventist.  I want to belong to a church which appleals not only to<br>
those raised within the subculture but to those on the "outside".<br>
I am wondering how to be a witness in the midst of my own stuggle to<br>
my new friend. <br>
<p>
On another note, maybe someone could help me understand the perspective<br>
of a new attendee to an Adventist church.  How did you feel initially? <br>
What was it that attracted you to the belief system and subculture you <br>
now adapt to?<br>

Dave, From my observations of the SDA church I do not sense the<br>
denomination trying to control what people believe. I believe there is<br>
more "freedom" of thought in the church then there has previously been. I<br>
think we owe this freedom to individuals like Bob Brimsmead and Des Ford.<br>
This has caused many SDAs,to re study our position on the teachings of<br>
the Bible and know for certainty why we believe what we do.<br>
<p>
There are and have been individuals that appear to be conservative<br>
legalists  -- it is these people who are trying to pour us into "their<br>
mold" of Adventist theology. And believe there is no room for discussion<br>
unity in diversity.<br>

The following is from a fellow christian whom I met on talk.origins.<br>
He is starting up an e-mail net list to christains who wish to<br>
discuss origins from a christain point of view, to offer thoughts<br>
and assistance for those who are posting on talk.origins or just<br>
talking with each other.  If you want on his list mail to his<br>
address at the end of his note.  C. Allen Roy<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Hello fellow Creationists,<br>
<p>
I think a Christian Creationist mailing list is a good idea but<br>
I'm unsure how to go about setting one up or what to say. The<br>
tone most evolutionists use, along with the name calling get on<br>
my nerves after awhile, and there are so many evolutionists that<br>
I find it difficult to pray for them all. <br>
<p>
Recently, I exchanged some email with Matt Brinkman who is an<br>
evolutionist and Christian (I guess that gets interpreted as: <br>
theistic evolutionist). We were't communicating too well and <br>
ended up arguing back and forth over who was being sincere, and<br>
both of us were using the principles taught in Matthew 18:15-17 <br>
which discusses what to do when a brother sins against you.<br>
We've discussed the situation and have decided to start it up<br>
again next week after we've rested on the weekend. We'll be<br>
communicating via email, not posting in talk.origins.<br>
<p>
One of my main concerns in talk.origins is our relationships<br>
with fellow believers who are also evolutionists. Another concern<br>
is how we repond to the non-believers who are also evolutionists.<br>
I'm sure we all realize the importance of our postings being read <br>
by many people, mostly lurkers just reading once, twice or more.<br>
The impression we leave on these individuals is very important. <br>
I don't think I'm telling you something you haven't already heard<br>
or know, I just sometimes need a reminder that the non-believer<br>
is watching the Christian as if they were under a microscope.<br>
<p>
I'd like to get to know all of you, so please don't be shy. I'd<br>
like to tell you where I'm coming from and why I post to talk.origins,<br>
but that'll have to wait for a future date. <br>
<p>
I'd like to encourage you to continue to fight the good fight and<br>
to pray for those in talk.origins, that are what I believe to be<br>
misguided as far as origins are concerned. <br>
<p>
I don't know where this mailing list will lead and I can make no<br>
promises, I even have doubts as to even starting it up, but Lord<br>

I can identify to some extent with Alice's post, being at least as much<br>
a product of the SDA system as she is, and also a graduate student at a<br>
secular university with a close non-SDA friend (although nowhere near as<br>
close as a few months ago when I posted before).  Perhaps in my field I<br>
am more likely to encounter atheists, Jews, and nominal Christians than<br>
someone like Alice's friend.  <br>
<p>
I have been at enough parties where I am the only sober one, and the<br>
only vegetarian, that the standards I keep are well-known to my friends<br>
and co-workers.  Everyone notices that I don't come in on Saturday in<br>
what is a 24-hour a day 7-day a week business.  But many of them have<br>
also heard from me what I do while I'm at church (the puppets, the youth<br>
group, the organ playing, the volleyball nights, etc.)  In other words,<br>
I try to portray my <br>
religion as something I do, rather than something I don't.  When the<br>
questions come, as they invariably do, they are about deeper issues than<br>
the standards I observe.<br>
<p>
I must say that in my interactions I have compromised more than I ought<br>
to sometimes.  I have learned a lot about myself and why the standards<br>
are what they are in the process, but then I am forced to deal with the<br>
various impressions made on my mind by the activities I have<br>
participated in.  <br>
In distinguishing culture from God's word, examine your motives and ask<br>
why are you keeping, or rejecting a particular standard.  <br>
<p>
<p>
The whole questions of why we have standards, or why we have 27 doctrines <br>
instead of one, I will defer to another day.  But perhaps the best way<br>
to make the faith your own is to share it with someone else.<br>

We are in need of some information from SDA students and professionals.  I<br>
would like to have responses from any and all of you.  Perhaps we can all<br>
learn together.<br>
<p>
What kinds of experiences have you as SDA university students or professionals<br>
in a non-SDA environment had in witnessing or sharing your faith with non-SDA<br>
peers?   Positive?  Negative?  What worked best?<br>
<p>
I'll be glad for answers, either on SDANET or email.<br>
Thanks for your postings.<br>

Helli all,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	One other interesting note.  This book said that Seventh-day Adventists</i><br>
<i>&gt;	are "Fundamentalist Pentecostal Protestants."  Although SDAs deny that</i><br>
<i>&gt;	they are "pentecostal", the real world thinks SDAs ARE!  I wonder what</i><br>
<i>&gt;	this is based on.  I would venture that as more "Celebration Churches"</i><br>
<i>&gt;	form, this opinion will get stronger among outsiders.</i><br>
<p>
I once read a publication from an ex-Jesuit that explained the way that<br>
the Vatican considered the various protestant denominations for the purpose<br>
of furthering ecumentism. This plan was to first make stronger ties between<br>
small groups of religions which they put together according to their <br>
views of which religions would be easier to merge together. Interestingly<br>
the SDAs the pentecostals and some other religions were clustered together.<br>

Steve, what do you mean by the 90 percent of tithe used to support the<br>
church institutions?  Which ones?  That seems strange to me.<br>
<p>
Nancy<br>
vyhmeist@andrews.edu<br>
<p>
<p>
[The 90% figure is actually the percentage of money, tithe and offerings<br>
together, that goes into maintaining existing institutions, including<br>
salaries of people employed there.  This includes all local churches.<br>
It does not include funds spent on evangelism.  <br>
<p>
This figure is actually fairly low as compared with other denominations,<br>
whose fraction of existing maintenance is even greater.  SCT]<br>

<i>&gt; So when I speak of unity, I speak of unity within the remnant, not </i><br>
<i>&gt; unity with the world.  This type of unity must have as its base a proactive</i><br>

<p>
Good texts.<br>

Unity with Christ which may not add up to unity with man, not at the<br>

Tom Prasada-Rao's new solo album, "Incoming", is on Crossroads Records, <br>
distributed by Spectra.  He has performed in various private label<br>
recordings with his family, and as backup guitarist on other recordings,<br>
but this is his solo debut.  The album is produced by Mark Heard.<br>
<p>
I expected good guitar playing on this album, and Tom delivers.  But he also <br>
delivers witty and thought-provoking lyrics and is quite a good vocalist.<br>
His lyrics are colored by being from Washington DC, and sometimes take on <br>
a political tinge.  A sample:<br>
"We'll harvest all the tourists, and winnow them like wheat<br>
bring in all the right kind, not those people off the street<br>
it's a losing proposition to champion their cause<br>
when we can bring the folks in here who pay taxes and heed laws."<br>
(from "Driftwood")<br>
<p>
"Who are these true disciples, seekers of the truth<br>
who coat the word with pleasure, then swallow down their youth."<br>
"How have the mighty fallen , soldiers of the cross<br>
who pacify the vicious and crucify the lost.<br>
(from "How have the mighty fallen.)<br>
<p>
You will find this a comfortable album to listen to.  It's the folk music of <br>
the 60's given a 090's twist by new arrangements and orchestrations.<br>
There's nothing on this album that could really be described as rock and<br>
roll.   But it is all enjoyable and musically complex.<br>
<p>
<p>
Steve's rating:  Four thistles!  (on a scale of -5 to 5)<br>
This is a must-buy!<br>

I believe the reason why we SDAs are placed in the Pentecostal category be <br>
some other Christians is that we teach about the gifts of the Holy Spirit, <br>
especially the gift of prophecy. To some that makes us Pentecostal. It has <br>
nothing to do with worship style as was suggested. I have been to pentecostal <br>
churches that make SDA churches look alive.<br>

Hi Danny,<br>
<p>
Following are my comments on the letter you included; feel free to<br>
post all or part of them, as you see fit.  By the way, what IS SDA-Net?<br>
<p>
                                        - Lorin<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Over the time we have known each other he has developed a </i><br>
<i>&gt;distinct impression that our church is filled with rules.  The rules </i><br>
<i>&gt;obviously make no sense to him and seem to have no logical basis.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am saddened that I have been unable to saticfactorily answer his</i><br>
<i>&gt;questions and that much of what I do does seem more of a habit or</i><br>
<i>&gt;way of life than within religous conviction.</i><br>
<p>
As a new Adventist (3 years) who entered the church at age 24, I've<br>
experienced some of this, too.  I think your friend's reaction is<br>
natural, considering that (1) most Protestant churches have almost NO<br>
guidelines that they enforce, and (2) our own message is often<br>
mis-handled and, from the wrong person, can sound very like the<br>
Pharisees of old.  I've noticed that we can unintentionally send the<br>
wrong message ourselves, with phrases like, "I *can't* do that today,<br>
it's sabbath." or "I can't eat pork."  Such phrasing implies that we<br>
really WANT to chow down on porkchops and go dancing on sabbath, but<br>
our church doesn't LET us.  Compare to something like "I don't want<br>
to...", "I choose not to...", which takes ownership of the decision.<br>
<p>
Nonetheless, there are some of our doctrines which I have a hard time<br>
defending.  In many cases, though, these are NOT official church <br>
positions, but just extreme beliefs held by a vocal few.  For example,<br>
many folks oppose wedding rings.  I don't believe this position can<br>
be defended scripturally, and I choose to wear one.  The "church" does<br>
NOT forbid the wedding ring.  Likewise, I refuse to place the writings <br>
of Ellen White on the same level as the Bible. This is in total<br>
harmony with the official "party line", per the book "Questions on<br>
Doctrine" (A SUPER book, by the way). However, we have some very<br>
vocal, very pious members who consider EGW the standard by which the<br>
Bible is to be interpreted, and, in fact, quote her writings FAR more than<br>
they quote the Bible.  Again, I don't have to assume this extreme stance<br>
to be an Adventist, and to respect EGW for her counsels.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am also saddened as I am asked to explain some of the inconsistencies</i><br>
<i>&gt;within my church.  For example:  Our mutual friend.... wears jewelry,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I do not....she goes out to lunch on Sabbath... I do not...  she herself</i><br>
<i>&gt;is in real disbelief and trust of the Adventist motives and</i><br>
<i>&gt;practices.  </i><br>
<p>
You don't have to explain them.  In any group, some will take their<br>
faith more seriously than others.  Also, a great many things are<br>
matters of personal conviction; "let each be firmly convinced in his<br>
own mind."  I choose not to eat out on sabbath, but I know of nothing <br>
which prohibits one from so doing, if they feel it acceptable.  Many<br>
consider my simple gold wedding band to be forbidden "adornment".<br>
That is their right. Naturally, if a member if blatantly trampling <br>
on church standards, that member should be counseled by the pastor, and<br>
the standard procedures followed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The subculture as I call it, has kept me within its confines and I</i><br>
<i>&gt;have been unable to make friends outside the church for most of my</i><br>
<i>&gt;life.  Now as l do so... I feel inept,  unable to communicate,  and odd.</i><br>
<p>
You're not alone.  I've heard the same comment from others with<br>
your background.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How can I deal with these and grow from the situation without rejecting</i><br>
<i>&gt;the truth?  without placing myself on dangerous ground in the meantime?</i><br>
<i>&gt;How can I know the culture from the important issues when I have parents</i><br>
<i>&gt;and church patriarches telling me what I've heard already for 26 years?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sometimes I feel like I'm playing with the devil and he's having a good</i><br>
<i>&gt;time with me.  And Yet I feel as if I must come to grips with the </i><br>
<i>&gt;many "why's" I am now faced with.</i><br>
<p>
The secret, and the key to one's Christian walk (in my opinion), is to<br>
make it a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  I've felt many similar<br>
doubts and questions; prayer and Bible study has helped me remain secure<br>
in my faith.  DON'T take the word of the "church patriarchs"; DON'T<br>
repeat your beliefs like some denominations do their creeds, by memorizing.<br>
Dig into it and see; you'll grow, and have fun at the same time!  If you're<br>
not convicted that the investigative judgement began in 1844 (for example),<br>
that's FINE! But don't stop there. Paul commended the Bereans because,<br>
rather than taking his word for his new teachings, they went home and<br>
studied it out for themselves.  God doesn't expect us to accept the word<br>
of the church fathers; it is our priviledge (responsibility?) to search<br>
the Word for ourselves.<br>
<p>
Jesus DOES have the answers to all of our "whys". Not all things are<br>
immediately apparent; some are as "treasure hidden in a field." The<br>
searching and exploring is half the fun!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I want to know how to live in the world and still be an</i><br>
<i>&gt;Adventist.  I want to belong to a church which appleals not only to</i><br>
<i>&gt;those raised within the subculture but to those on the "outside".</i><br>
<p>
I agree that it would be nice if we could always show our best side<br>
to the public.  There are limits, though, to how far we can go.  Sadly,<br>
most people will NEVER be attracted to the SDA church; through no<br>
fault of ours.  The good news is that there are MANY of us who WERE, <br>
and ARE, attracted enough to join.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;On another note, maybe someone could help me understand the perspective</i><br>
<i>&gt;of a new attendee to an Adventist church.  How did you feel initially? </i><br>
<i>&gt;What was it that attracted you to the belief system and subculture you </i><br>
<i>&gt;now adapt to?</i><br>
<p>
My first impressions: (1) Amazed and worried that there were no crosses in<br>
the church; are these guys Christians or not? Maybe they're like<br>
Jehovah's Witnesses, and don't uplift Jesus as the source of salvation...<br>
(2) Impressed with the sincerity and dedication of the members. Clearly,<br>
they live what they believe.  Church for Adventists is not just a <br>
once-a-week "fire insurance" policy. (3) All their beliefs can be<br>
defended from the Bible (some better than others!  :-)  ) They<br>
consistently appeal to scripture as the source of their teachings. All<br>
the members bring their Bibles to church.  (4) The adults have sabbath<br>
school, and it's well-attended. Hmm... that means they emphasize<br>
continuing learning and growth.  (5) The comprehensive nature of<br>
our message!!!!  We reach out spiritually through evangelistic meetings,<br>
Bible studies, etc.  We reach out physically through community services,<br>
ADRA, food basket programs, etc.  The whole SDA structure seems geared<br>
toward helping and serving, on local, regional, even international levels.<br>
And, given Jesus' instructions on how to treat people, THAT's something<br>
to be proud of.<br>
<p>
In summary, I'm still learning, still growing, and still having fun!<br>
I'm not convicted on every church doctrine, but I'm secure in my<br>
knowledge of salvation through Jesus. The rest will come in time. <br>
Meanwhile, the SDA church is a sincere, effective, committed group of<br>
Christians, with Bible-based principles, and one which I'm very<br>
happy to associate myself with.<br>

      This is another SDA question from a Non-SDA..<br>
      I have picked up on the net some discussions on witnessing<br>
      and evangelism.  Do any SDA churches do any "door to door"<br>
      evangelism ?  At this time, I don't have any strong convictions<br>
      either way regarding door to door, but am just curious.  Also,<br>
      are there any certain formats for alter calls ? Does every church<br>
      use them, or only some?  Is it at every service or only from time<br>
      to time ?<br>
      Thanks in advance<br>

Eric, I am originally from Africa.  I grew up in the SDA faith, and, in<br>
Africa, we BELIEVE that it is the duty of every member to share his/her<br>
faith: House-to-house, door-to-door, office-to-office - wherever the<br>
opportunity arrives.  Ever wondered why evangelism has a 90+% success<br>
in Africa?<br>
<p>
I came to America and although the members SEEM to believe the same as<br>
we do in Africa, they tend to leave visitation, etc, to the pastors and<br>
elders.  Only a few of the members seem to follow the door to door "visitation"<br>
process.  I guess it's culture difference - in Africa, I'm ALWAYS welcome<br>
to a stranger's house and I can discuss any legitimate topic.  In America,<br>
I'm careful that I do not get on the person's nerves and have to be sure<br>
that I am really invited.  (In America, I have only visited members - not<br>
nonmembers, to specifically discuss religion.)<br>
<p>
I think the alter call is left to the preacher.  Most preachers do the alter<br>
call anyway.  Many tend to turn it into an affirmation of faith.<br>
<p>
In Hershey, you are very close to most of our wonderful and caring preachers<br>
and I hope you will one Saturday show your face in one of our churches and<br>
approach the preacher at the close of service with your questions.  I assure<br>
you he/she will be delighted that someone has questions.<br>
<p>
Did I help or did I raise more questions?<br>

I was impressed and encouraged recently when the population of (white)<br>
South Africa voted to continue with reforms.  Also in the past few months,<br>
the two unions in South Africa have voted to merge, bringing a racially<br>
unified church structure in South Africa.<br>
<p>
Never mind that we were the last major denomination in South Africa to do so,<br>
even after the Dutch Reformed.  We've done it, and the churches in South <br>
Africa need our support.  The main obstacle for so many years was money,<br>
and it still is.  Bringing the pastors of different races to the same<br>
pay level will take a lot, and supporting two colleges, etc.  A portion of <br>
the next Week of Sacrifice offering will be designated for this purpose.<br>
<p>
Now the next question.  When will all the American Black pastors who lobbied<br>
so hard for this action of merging racially separate conferences wake up <br>
and realize that they are calling for exactly the opposite here?<br>
Why was apartheid unacceptable in South Africa, but required in the USA?<br>

Steve,<br>
I did not quite understand your reference to African American pastors and<br>
their lobbying efforts.  Would you please clarify with a little background<br>
information?<br>
 <br>
As to South Africans, I agree that this is a step in the right direction.  It<br>
remains to be seen just how involved (administratively and socially) Black<br>
South Africans will be ALLOWED to be.  It may well be that with time, Black<br>
South Africans will become even more dissatisfied with the role GIVEN them in<br>
the church, and decide to TAKE on roles that allow them to participate more<br>
fully. Possibly in matters where Black/White issues are concerned this can be<br>
accomplished best through separate systems, if everyone is given the same<br>
amount of financial and moral support across the board.<br>
 <br>
Frankly, I am disappointed that the Adventist church allowed itself to be<br>
influenced by the popular political policies of the day regarding race<br>
relations, both in South Africa and in this country initially (maybe even to<br>
some degree today?).<br>

<i>&gt; Now the next question.  When will all the American Black pastors who lobbied</i><br>
<i>&gt; so hard for this action of merging racially separate conferences wake up</i><br>
<i>&gt; and realize that they are calling for exactly the opposite here?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why was apartheid unacceptable in South Africa, but required in the USA?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Steve Timm</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I CANT' SPEAK for the black pastors, but I have been acquainted with the<br>
situation of Latino (hispanic, Spanish, Mexican, Puerto Rican, etc, or<br>
whatever name they receive --or adopt-- [by the way, all those names<br>
are correct, except Spanish --it should be Spanish-speaking]).<br>
 <br>
It seems to me that the situation in South Africa and the US is quite<br>
different.  While there racism was legally institutionalized (and thus,<br>
an act of merging conferences was a way to protest such institutionalization),<br>
the situation in the Us is the opposite.  Here, in most states, racism has<br>
completely dissapeared from the laws, but racist attitudes are still<br>
very much present. Pat Buchanan, David Duke and others have a track record<br>
of opposing blacks, Jews and Latinos.  Buchanan did not hesitate to suggest<br>
building a wall between the U.S.-Mexican border to prevent illegal<br>
migration [here the situation needs to be clarified: there was no Mexican<br>
migration in the southwest, five Us states were mexican!!!, the people<br>
who migrated to California, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and parts of<br>
other states were actually the migrants; Puerto Rico was annexed to<br>
the US by the US in 1898; and one could further argue that most of<br>
the recent migration from central America and the caribbean has been caused<br>
by the wars fought with US and Soviet money by local guerillas and armies].<br>
 <br>
I am sure that all these cases of racist attitued are well known and<br>
cause all of you to be as ashamed as I am.<br>
 <br>
Within the church, however, I have experienced some feelings of neglect<br>
and paternalism on the part of the leadership of the church when it<br>
comes to Latinos.  neglect in the sense that the church does not<br>
recognize the different needs of the different grups (for instance, Latino<br>
churches have as many people who are Spanish speakers as those who<br>
are English speakers --and here I refer to their first language--; its<br>
is imperative, then, to prepare pastors who are bilingual, and not<br>
to bringSpanish speakign pastors from Latin America.  It is easier to<br>
bring people from Latin America (because many of them want to come<br>
anyway due to economic pressures) than to prepare the US born and<br>
raised Latino youth.  I see this as a major source of neglect and a<br>
major cause of preventing further growth of the church among Latinos.<br>
 <br>
I also see some neglect in the way Latino affairs are handled.  The<br>
president (or the board) of a conference appoints a pastor who will<br>
be the coordinator of Hispanic ministries.  This person is in fact<br>
the 'president of Latino churches.  The church becomes extremely<br>
hierarchical with such structure and problems more often than not never<br>
pass beyond the coordinator.  The coordinator then finds himself in a<br>
position of incredible influence and power (his suggestion may cause<br>
the hiring/firing of pastors) and many times uses such power<br>
indiscriminately.  The president and the board of the conference needs<br>
to be more aquainted with the problems facing Latino churches to<br>
prevent this one-man rule.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
I also see PATERNALISM within the church.  Just one example: I was in<br>
Hinsdale church (IL) a couple of weeks ago; the Sabbath School was<br>
collecting material donations for the 'kids down there in the city,<br>
the poor kids of the city'. Now, when you correlate the fac that most<br>
Latino churches are in fact in the inner city (while most 'white'<br>
churches are in the suburbs), then since their early childhood<br>
children learn to correlate poor children with city children (and<br>
thus 'minority' children).  At an adult age, this attitude (and I<br>
am aware of the generalization I am doing, but I feel it's<br>
necessary to make my point) also affects the way in which church<br>
officials see the members, pastors and the church of the cities<br>
in general.<br>
 <br>
And, as we are all aware, paternalism only causes rejection on the part<br>
of those who are being 'paternalized' or, worse, it causes dependency.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
For this reason, many Latino churches have looked towards the black<br>
conferences searching for a different attitude. In states  other than<br>
Illinois, some pastors have talked about forming Latino conferences.<br>
 <br>
In conclusion, I agree with Tim in the idea that the church should<br>
be unified in matters such as administrative organization.  Yet in<br>
order to achieve this, it is necessary that all parties understand<br>
what theie role, contributions and responsibilites are and,<br>
more importantly, what they role was in the process that caused this<br>
de-unification in the first place.<br>

<p>
Apartheid was a case of the politically dominant whites -forcing- the black<br>
population to be seperated from them in every way, shape, and form, where it<br>
was possible.  Here in the US, 'black' churches &lt;personally, I don't believe <br>
in the concept of 'race'.  Show me pictures of palest nordic person you can<br>
find and the darkest african, and I'll line up a host of pictures between them<br>
with differences so slight you'll be unable to tell me where one 'race' ends<br>
and another begins.  We are all one race.  But I digress...&gt;  want their own<br>
conferences because they feel the conference structure as it currently exists<br>
does not address their needs.  They feel that if they had their own conferences,<br>
Those conference leaders would see to it that the needs of their churches -were-<br>
addressed.  <br>
<p>
With apartheid, the dominant group forced the split.<br>
Here in our minority churches, many disaffected members want it.<br>
<p>
The tragedy to me is not that the minority churches want their own conferences,<br>
but that the existing structures have done so abysmal a job of caring for those<br>
churches that they would want to be seperate.<br>

Linda Carpenter asks what lobbying effort I refer to on the part of African <br>
American pastors in the South African issue.  In the period 1985-1987, and <br>
probably before that slightly as well, there were some who advocated cutting<br>
out all ties with the South African Seventh-day Adventists unless they<br>
integrated.  At Andrews University at that time, there were faculty <br>
pressing to drop Andrews University's affiliation with the South African<br>
Helderberg College.  At the 1985 General Conference session, the delegates<br>
from the (white/colored/indian) South African Union couldn't eat at the<br>
same place as everyone else for fear that there would be a disturbance.<br>
Of course, at that session, the GC statement on apartheid was voted,<br>
and in 1986, the South Africans formed a commission to try to racially<br>
unify their church.  The recommendations of that commission were<br>
unfortunately ignored, and the problem was only taken up again last year.<br>
<p>
People try to emphasize the difference between the South African situation<br>
and the US situation.  While in the political situation there are many<br>
differences, the church situation has a lot of striking similarities.<br>
(Although I must admit that no SDA in North America has been "necklaced"<br>
recently for his/her faith).  Here there is pressure from the Black leaders<br>
to remain separate.  This pressure also existed there, as they worried that <br>
mergers might lead to closing of some of the educational institutions which<br>
kept their tuition low so as to better serve Black students.  But the Black<br>
ministers had (correct me if I'm wrong) a good advantage in this because<br>
now the pay scale will be non-racial and all ministers will make the same <br>
money.  <br>
<p>
I have often heard it said by people in the regional conferences "It is <br>
better to have our own house than no house at all."  We must realize that<br>
at first Black SDA's formed their own churches, not because they wanted <br>
to, but because white churches, particularly in the South, would not<br>
accept them.  Oakwood College was formed for the same reason.  <br>
These institutions are born of segregation.<br>
<p>
If churches of different ethnic backgrounds have different agendas,<br>
we need to examine why this is so, and then start the kind of dialogue<br>
within our church that unifies our agenda once more.  Our church has no <br>
master plan for Chicago or Pittsburgh (the only 2 cities I know about <br>
firsthand) because the conferences refuse to cooperate.  When we see that <br>
neither conference (Illinois or Lake Region) has the money to do anything,<br>
then it's time to start thinking that maybe two conference offices in the <br>
same metro area is a luxury we can no longer afford.  Worse, maybe it's<br>
a liability we can no longer afford.<br>
<p>
The fact that there remains a color barrier within our church is shameful.<br>
But more shameful yet is the problem that so few people even want to <br>
try to bridge that barrier.  <br>

I'm wondering if I have Steve's original point correct.  That is, was it<br>
suggested that African American pastors exhibited inconsistent behavior in<br>
calling for a merger of churches in South Africa while continuing to insist<br>
upon separation based on race here in the U.S.?<br>
 <br>
Different agendas - well, I don't know about differing agendas, but there are<br>
certain issues that have served to separate us here in the U.S.  The issue of<br>
emotional outpouring in the worship service has always been, and remains, a<br>
big one.  I have noted (with some amusement) the concern over "celebration<br>
churches".  It doesn't appear to be a major issue in regional churches - as a<br>
friend of mine said this weekend; "practically all of our churches are<br>
'celebration churches'" in some form or another.  I don't understand the fuss;<br>
I've always felt free to be vocal and demonstrative in my worship.  I<br>
certainly am aware that many White brothers and sisters may not feel that way.<br>
 <br>
Let's see; interracial dating - another biggie.  I thought it might be a<br>
little different from my academy days of 10 years or so ago when it was MAJOR<br>
taboo, but from what I've heard, that is not the case.  This final bastion of<br>
prejudice seems to be very much intact in the SDA church.  A seminary student<br>
once remarked to me that he thought an African American friend of mine was<br>
absolutely wonderful and wondered why she hadn't been "snatched up" by some<br>
young man.  When I suggested that he ask her out, he turned bright red and<br>
indicated that he probably wouldn't have much of a church career with a Black<br>
wife. This occurred only a few months ago.<br>
 <br>
These are but two of the several issues that seem to divide the church along<br>
racial lines.  In my opinion it is not about the Hispanics, Native Americans,<br>
West Indians, African Americans, etc., having different agendas; it's about<br>
prevailing racial attitudes and how they stymie our spiritual, social, and<br>
economic growth.<br>

To SDAnet,<br>
<p>
The following excerpts of the countries with SDA listed is taken from<br>
"THE WORLD FACTBOOK 1990 ELECTRONIC VERSION."  It's interesting how<br>
the CIA usually considers SDA as a Christian organization, but not<br>
Protestant -- hence, lumping SDA with Jehovah's Witnesses and Latter<br>
Day Saints.  (See Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, and<br>
Netherlands Antilles in comparison with Belize.)  Note that the<br>
countries are all non-major ones (well, except maybe Netherlands<br>
Antilles -- Schlumberger (pronounced "Sh-lum-bur-jay") Limited, for<br>
tax purposes, is headquartered there :-).<br>

This item was posted to the GRANOLA Vegetarian mail list.  I thought<br>
it interesting enough to post here.<br>
<p>
It is not clear what the SDA position is on some of these, or whether<br>
there should even be one.<br>
<p>
Glen McCluskey<br>

<p>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
This information originally came from a SPY magazine survey, reported<br>
by Utne Reader (Jan/Feb, 1992, pg.152, "Kill Ted Bundy!  But save the<br>
cows!").  Given the current discussions on GRANOLA, I thought others<br>
might find this interesting.<br>
<p>
The following organizations were asked about their position on life-and-<br>
death issues:<br>
<p>
 * Council for a Livable Word (CLW) - pro-disarmament<br>
 * American Life Lobby (ALL) - anti-abortion<br>
 * Washington Legal Foundation (WLF) - pro-capital punishment<br>
 * National Coalition Against the Death Penalty (NCADP)<br>
 * Ducks Unlimited (DU) - conserve wetlands to provide ducks for hunting<br>
 * People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA)<br>
 * American Vegan Society (AVS) - wear no animal-derived clothing<br>
<p>
Below are their reponses to each question.<br>
<p>
1.  Would you kill a human fetus?<br>
<p>
(CLW)   - Lean toward yes: "We must balance sanctity-of-life against the<br>
                            specter of unlimited population."<br>
(ALL)   - No: "Life is sacred in all cases."<br>
(WLF)   - No: "There is nothing inconsistent with being pro-death<br>
               penalty and pro-life."<br>
(NCADP) - "We have no position; it's not important."<br>
(DU)    - "I can't comment, you know."<br>
(PeTA)  - "We would have to poll our members to find their views."<br>
(AVS)   - No: "It is a living creature whose life we must respect."<br>
<p>
<p>
2.  Would you kill a death-row inmate?<br>
<p>
(CLW)   - No: "This is the destruction of innocent life."<br>
(ALL)   - Yes: "We want to protect all *innocent* life."<br>
(WLF)   - Yes: "You know it.  Sanctity-of-life-does not apply."<br>
(NCADP) - No: "The death penalty is morally wrong."<br>
(DU)    - "Again, I can only talk about fowl."<br>
(PeTA)  - "I can't comment unless a member asked about it."<br>
(AVS)   - No: "It's ridiculous to kill someone to reform him."<br>
<p>
<p>
3.  Would you kill a brain-dead person?<br>
<p>
(CLW)   - No: "Euthanasia is a form of suicide."<br>
(ALL)   - No: "You're dead or you're not dead."<br>
(WLF)   - "I don't know."<br>
(NCADP) - "We can't address that."<br>
(DU)    - No comment.<br>
(PeTA)  - "We don't take a stand on that."<br>
(AVS)   - No.<br>
<p>
<p>
4.  Would you kill a soldier in conventional warfare?<br>
<p>
(CLW)   - Yes: "I would defend my home and country."<br>
(ALL)   - No: "We oppose war."<br>
(WLF)   - "We don't get involved in that."<br>
(NCADP) - "As a group we can't agree."<br>
(DU)    - Yes: "i suppose so. Yes."<br>
(PeTA)  - We'd be more convcerned with animals."<br>
(AVS)   - No: "But we are not passive.  We disarm them with love."<br>
<p>
<p>
5.  Would you kill innocent civilians in a nuclear war?<br>
<p>
(CLW)   - No: "Definitely not."<br>
(ALL)   - No: "We oppose war."<br>
(WLF)   - "No comment."<br>
(NCADP) - "Again, we can't take a position."<br>
(DU)    - No.<br>
(PeTA)  - "Again, we really are concerned with animals."<br>
(AVS)   - "Definitely not."<br>
<p>
<p>
6.  Would you kill a cow for food?<br>
<p>
(CLW)   - Yes.<br>
(ALL)   - Yes: "That's not a concern to us."<br>
(WLF)   - "The only issue we get involved in is the death penalty."<br>
(NCADP) - "We don't address those issues."<br>
(DU)    - "I can only talk about fowl."<br>
(PeTA)  - No: "We oppose any process that harasses an animal."<br>
(AVS)   - No. "We are total vegetarians."<br>
<p>
<p>
7.  Would you kill a cat for a lab experiment?<br>
<p>

                alive."<br>
(WLF)   - "The only issue we get involved in is the death penalty."<br>
(NCADP) - "I can't say."<br>
(DU)    - No comment.<br>
(PeTA)  - No: "It is wrong to exploit or abuse any animal."<br>
(AVS)   - No: "We oppose any sort of animal torture."<br>

The cover story of Time magazine on February 24, 1992 was HOLY ALLIANCE,<br>
detailing for the first time the extensive cooperation between the<br>
Reagan administration and the Vatican in the support of Solidarity in<br>
Poland.<br>
During the seven years that Solidarity was underground, 1981-1988,<br>
the church was the primary conduit to the Solidarity leaders of news from <br>
the West, as well as a means of channeling funds, fax machines, and much else.<br>
<p>
Diplomatic recognition of the Vatican and the US shift away from funding<br>
birth control family planning programs in third world countries were<br>
both direct results of this alliance.  <br>
<p>
The article makes for fascinating reading.<br>

A brochure that came with my latest issue of Dialogue gives the <br>
following information:<br>
<p>
1992 Youth Evangelism Workshop,<br>
Prague, Czechoslovakia, August 4-8, 1992.<br>
To directly follow the youth congress in Budapest, Hungary, July 27-August 1.<br>
<p>
The workshop will be held at the University of Agriculture in Prague.<br>
Anyone with an interest in Youth or Campus ministry, or youth themselves,<br>
may attend.  The workshop fee is $140.00 US, and lodging is $100.00 double<br>
occupancy, $150.00 single occupancy.<br>
<p>
Speakers read like a who's who of youth workers.<br>
Bailey Gillespie, D. Wong, B. Muganda, M. Ryan, D. Hitchcock, R. Gibbs,<br>
W. Scragg, D. Baker, W. Johnsson, T. Neslund, R. Barron, S. Case, D. Case,<br>
M. Stevenson, D. Neal, R. Osborne, H. Rasi, N. Bassham, H. Berg, E. DeLeon,<br>
A. Marenko, E. Osei, D. Duerksen, J. Carter, M. Allen, R. Holbrook, M. Allen,<br>
B. Gane, D. Harris, R. Folkenberg.<br>
<p>
I know I will be in Europe for at least a month this summer on business,<br>
and it seems worthwhile to try to arrange it during this time.  If <br>
others have more information on this seminar, let us know.<br>

On the question of race relations in the SDA Church, I have found two very<br>
interesting books:<br>
<p>
Graybill, Ronald.  E. G. White and Church Race Relations.  Washington, DC:<br>
     Review and Herald, 1970.<br>
<p>
     Graybill, Ronald.  Mission to Black America.  Mtn. View, CA:<br>
	Pacific Press, 1971.<br>
<p>
	Very informative and well written.<br>

<i>&gt; On the question of race relations in the SDA Church, I have found two very</i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting books:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Graybill, Ronald.  E. G. White and Church Race Relations.  Washington, DC:</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Review and Herald, 1970.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Graybill, Ronald.  Mission to Black America.  Mtn. View, CA:</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Pacific Press, 1971.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Very informative and well written.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Nancy Vyhmeister</i><br>
<p>
I agree these are sources for information concerning race relations in the SDA<br>
church, but don't you think they are a little outdated? - note the publishing<br>
dates of over 20 years ago.  Are there contemporary sources of RESEARCH<br>
(biblical, social, economic, etc.) relating to various races and cultures<br>
within the SDA church?<br>

A recent book that came out on the topic of race relations in the church <br>
is Righteous Rebel, being a biography of W. W. Fordham.<br>
<p>
His career began at Oakwood College where he was one of the leaders of <br>
the 1932 student strike which demanded a Black president for that<br>
institution.  It chronicles the advances that have been made over the<br>
years in race relations.<br>
<p>
If you are looking for a research work, I would suggest Seeking A Sanctuary<br>
by Bull and Lockhart.  There is an extensive section in this book on <br>
race relations in the SDA church.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
	Tony writes :<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In Australia we don't have the diversity of independent ministries</i><br>
<i>&gt;that exist in the US, but we certainly have our per capita fair share.</i><br>
<i>&gt;They accuse the organisation of ignoring divine counsel or whatever,&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;the organisation tries its hardest to ignore them, the conferences</i><br>
<i>&gt;complain about tithe being diverted, and the situation continues to</i><br>
<i>&gt;worsen.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm tired of seeing the church (and others) attacked by publications</i><br>
<i>&gt;such as "The Remnant Herald", "The Protestant", those anti-celebration</i><br>
<i>&gt;videos, and a whole lot of other items I have been fortunate enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;to avoid. It is also disturbing to see the church authorities responding</i><br>
<i>&gt;in kind (well, almost).</i><br>
<p>
I'd just like to qualify this by saying that the independant ministries<br>
in Australia are not in the same league as those in the US. Most of the <br>
independent ministries I know of are very small, typically just one lay<br>
member running his own printing press. Most of these are not anti-SDA church<br>
and you won't see them denouncing the church. <br>
<p>
I am not aware of "The Remnant Herald" but I am aware of the "The Protestant".<br>
This latter one should I say is comprised of a fair proportion of non-SDA's<br>
who like to spend their time accusing the church of being Babylon.<br>
<p>
Being aware of the independant minstries in the US like Weimar college and<br>
Hartlands and Pr. Ron Spear's group etc which are by and large very supportive<br>
of the church (Even though they might not agree with everything that goes on).<br>
I can say that groups like the ones that publish "The Protestant" would have<br>
absolutely nothing in common.<br>
<p>
Ruben.<br>

SDAnet inadvertently got a post which I intended for the usenet group<br>
rec.music.christian.  I hope you all enjoy anyway. I frequently review<br>
contemporary Christian music albums for that newsgroup.  Just to fill you<br>
in, the ratings that were mentioned are on a scale of -5 to 5, but as you <br>
see, I review mostly quality stuff.  Negative ratings are thorns<br>
and positive ratings are thistles.  Two of the artists in that list<br>
are Seventh-day Adventists, Bret Barry and Tom Prasada-Rao.  Take 6 also<br>
appears in one song on one of the albums. <br>

Ruben said:<br>
<p>
Being aware of the independant minstries in the US like Weimar college and<br>
Hartlands and Pr. Ron Spear's group etc which are by and large very supportive<br>
of the church (Even though they might not agree with everything that goes on).<br>
<p>
<p>
Incidently, Ruben, Hartland Institute is one of the independents specifically<br>
named in the NAD denounciation.  The other ministries were Hope International/<br>
Our Firm Foundation; Prophecy Countdown; Steps to Life Church in Wichita, Kansas;<br>
and Rolling Hills Church of Rolling Hills, Florida.<br>
<p>
Two other items of interest from the NAD article for those who haven't seen it<br>
or don't have access:<br>
<p>
1)  The article references the book "Issues:  The Seventh-day Adventist Church<br>
and Certain Private Ministries" numerous times with comments that more info<br>
about a specific problem could be found there.  It also contained the following<br>
statement about that book:  "We [the editors] also endorse circulating the<br>
book, "Issues:  The Seventh-day Adventist Church and Certain Private Ministries"<br>
in the North American Division, in order that all interested individuals may<br>
be able to clearly recognize the serious divisive problem caused by private<br>
organizations which attempt to establish a church within the Seventh-day<br>
Adventist Church."  At the end of the article, there is the following<br>
footnote:  "Copies of Issues:  The Seventh-day Adventist Church and Certain<br>
Private Ministries are now available at your Adventist Book Center.<br>
<p>
Now what this appears to be is a shrouded advertising gimmick to sale this<br>
book.  What better way to sale R&amp;H publications than to stir up a boiling<br>
pot by publishing the NAD condemnation of private ministries and then tell<br>
people to go buy this book and find out the details of why their doing so!<br>
<p>
2)  The article states that "Seventh-day Adventists consider themselves a<br>
divinely called movement, raised up to proclaim the good news of Christ's<br>
second coming and to help prepare the world for that glorious event."  SDAs<br>
supposedly fulfill this mission THROUGH the organized structure of the Church.<br>
The clincher on this point is this statement:  "In a few cases, private<br>
organizations have worked at corss-purposes with the denomination, have<br>
become destructively critical of the leadership of the Church, have undermined<br>
the confidence of members in the organized body of believers, and have<br>
drained away FUNDS which could have been used in accomplishing the mission of<br>
the Church, thus crippling the evangelistic outreach of the Church."<br>
<p>
Now this I don't understand.  Is the ONLY evangelistic outreach in the SDA<br>
church that of tithe-paid evangelists hired by the Church hierarchy?  I don't<br>
think this was ever the PRIMARY mode of evangelism propagated by EGW.  In<br>
fact, personal evangelism has ALWAYS been the most successful.  Is the<br>
evangelistic outreach of the SDA church REALLY crippled by these lost funds?<br>
Or is it a fact that so little of the tithe money goes for this purpose that<br>
now they've budgetted it out?  (Of course, the Division wouldn't think of<br>
trimming church hierarchy instead!  Having a top-heavy organization is<br>
more important than evangelism?)<br>
<p>
I've appreciated each and every comment on the net.  Thanks for your thoughts.<br>

Some of us at Andrews University are working with the E.G. White Estates<br>
to create on online unix version of the CD, including working out the<br>
licenseing questions.  There is hope that something will be up by as<br>
early as February sometime.<br>

 From Dec 7 to Dec 17 I will be in Berkeley, CA at Lawrence Berkeley Lab.<br>
Any SDAnetters near there, please let me know.  I expect to be able to <br>
continue service of SDAnet during this time, but it may be spotty.<br>
I'll certainly be busy testing VLSI devices.<br>
<p>
 From Dec. 22- Jan 1, I will take Christmas Vacation and there will be <br>
no SDAnet at all.  <br>

Some of the issues in human relations that I have raised over the past <br>
semester have led me to examine the question of how spiritual authority<br>
should be applied in general.  The problem was best described in a <br>
talk I heard several years ago given by Dr. Calvin Rock, then and now a <br>
general vice-president of the church with responsibility for education and <br>
publishing.  <br>
<p>
<p>
His remarks were to this effect:  "I am an advisor to the General Conference<br>
director of education, who is an advisor to the union education offices,<br>
who are advisors to the conference education offices and boards, who <br>
are advisory to the local school board, who are advisory to the local school."<br>
<p>
He was only slightly exaggerating.  Technically with K-12 education, the <br>
buck does stop with the local conference because they own the school<br>
buildings and pay the teachers.  But the lines of authority are confused,<br>
and the problem is not unique to education.  The SDA church in one lawsuit<br>
argued that it was a pure hierarchy, and in another a grass-roots democracy,<br>
and won both of them. <br>
<p>
At the union level, here and in South Africa, we have seen local conferences<br>
of different color refuse to work together even when it was voted in union<br>
session that they must do so.  At the conference level, we have seen a lack <br>
of effectiveness in dealing with the challenge presented to the authority <br>
of the church by independent ministries.  And at the local church level,<br>
there has been a breakdown of church discipline as the pendulum swings<br>
towards permissiveness.  In addition we see local pastors and conference<br>
leaders paralyzed by the complaints of a few people who are resistant to <br>
change in any form.  ("If the Church Hymnal was good enough for Ellen G.<br>
White, it's good enough for me!")<br>
<p>
Some growing churches make coherent plans for accountability for ministry.<br>
The minister chooses a small group to disciple, meeting weekly (or more <br>
frequently) with them.  In turn, each member of this small group becomes<br>
the leader of his/her own small group.  The minister thus receives support<br>
from, and is accountable to, a group of people who have their finger<br>
on the pulse of the church.  This makes it much easier to build consensus.<br>
<p>
I should point out that without the blessing of the Holy Spirit, such <br>
a small-group plan is doomed to fail, and with the Holy Spirit, other<br>
plans can work as well.  But some plan is necessary.  It's my deep conviction<br>
that the surface issues we face in our church over music, worship styles,<br>
lifestyles, and scriptural interpretation all revolve around the authority<br>
vacuum we are presently experiencing.  I would appreciate it if SDAnet<br>
would join me in searching for solutions to this.<br>

David P. notes that some of the Bible writers in the NT (and Jesus himself)<br>
didn't have the qualms that we have today concerning proper exegesis.<br>
Nancy Vyhmeister asked for some examples.  The most obvious place to start<br>
is the book of Matthew.  Try sometime reading Matthew in a translation<br>
such as the New American Standard, where every quote from the Old Testament<br>
is highlighted, then look up the context of these quotes in the OT.  You<br>
will see Matthew's method of interpretation.<br>

Although I am no longer a member of the SDA church, I still receive the<br>
Adventist Review regularly.  I don't know who's paying for it or having<br>
it sent to me, but I do read it with interest.  The December 3, 1992 NAD<br>
issue had an article about NAD action on private organizations which really<br>
caught my eye.  Here are my impressions--those of an outsider who has no<br>
knowledge or experience with the named organizations in the article.<br>
<p>
First, I was amazed at the seemingly unchristian attitude portrayed in the<br>
wording of the article.  Although it state specifically "this document is<br>
not presented in a spirit of combat or hostility" is reeks of that spirit.<br>
The words divisive or dissident appear in almost every paragraph.  There<br>
are strong words such as "accuse", "rival", "competition".  But the underlying<br>
motivition or thread in the article seemed to be that these private "divisive"<br>
organizations were successfully competing for tithe monies that the organized<br>
SDA church would like coming to their coffers.  Sample statements of this<br>
idea:  "They accuse the SDA church of activities which may encourage members<br>
to divert tithe to their private organizations rather than to the Church."<br>
"According to the Bible plan the Church is supported by tithes and offerings.<br>
When these private organizations seek or knowingly accept tithe for themselves,<br>
it thrusts at the heart of the individual Christian experience, for they are<br>
asking church members to switch loyalties away from God's plan to a rival<br>
plan."  "They threaten the viability of the Church when they encourage<br>
members to divert financial resources from the organized church to their<br>
private treasuries."<br>
<p>
I can understand the disappointment of SDA church members in the financial<br>
irresponsibility shown by Church leaders.  The Davenport Affair, the failure<br>
of Harris Pine Mills and numerous other financial blunders have left members<br>
wondering what they should do with their tithe.  At least these organizations<br>
seem to have a mission and use the money for gospel purposes.  What I don't<br>
understand is why this article can claim that an organized church setup in<br>
the way the SDA church is setup as "the Bible plan" or "God's plan".  For<br>
the Bible DOES NOT teach of any such plan or organization.  In the NT, the<br>
apostles were specifically chosen by Christ and replacement Apostles chosen<br>
by the remaining Apostles.  Nowhere does the Bible justify an elected<br>
leadership chosed by the an elite group.  Nowhere does the Bible teach that<br>
hierarchical leadership at Division, Union, Local Conference, Local congregation<br>
is "God's plan of church organization."  In the OT, religious leaders were<br>
chosen from the tribe of Levi and the tithing went to support them because<br>
they did no gainful employment to support themselves.  In the NT, the Church<br>
was financially organized as a community with all members owning assets<br>
jointly (a form of communism) and no individual owned anything outright.<br>
The present SDA organization doesn't resemble either of these two systems.<br>
<p>
I'd be interested in the observations of other SDAnetters on this article.<br>

It sems that the E.G. White Estates is going to drag their feet about<br>
allowing unix systems to access their CD rom.  They are still not sure<br>
that they are willing to allow multiple access to the CD rom or not.<br>
They don't know about multi-user systems, networks, or the internet and<br>
don't want to jeperdize the sale of the CD's for PC's.  All of the<br>
original books are no longer covered under the copyright laws, but there<br>
is still some question about whether the same material can be<br>
copyrighted when put onto a newer form of media such as the CD.<br>
<p>
They don't want to "release" anything until they have corrected some<br>
of the typo's in the current data.  This should be done by next summer.<br>

Steve Timm &amp; Net:<br>
<p>
Steve, <br>
<p>
enjoyed the Digest that I read last evening. I noticed that there were a<br>
few comments on Cheryl's "Steps in studying the Bible." In my opinion it<br>
was well done, concise, etc.<br>
<p>
The number #2 item: "Don't be afraid to challenge what you've been taught<br>
in the past." I thought that was very much on target because it is very<br>
easy to substitute tradition for truth. Also, because we do "proof text"<br>
ourselves into oblivion at times -- &lt;g&gt; -- it is probably good every so<br>
often to restudy our teachings. One of my favorite expressions is : "It is<br>
not important what I say, but what does the Bible teach!" I would hope<br>
that what I am teaching is Bible based, but what the Bible teaches is the<br>
all important thing.<br>
<p>
I am not trying to speak for Cheryl or put words in her mouth! -- Item #7<br>
which states that The Holy Bible is not the literal word of God is a<br>
correct statement. The way I perceived this statement was that the<br>
writer's of the Bible were inspired by the Holy Spirit -- "God Breathed"<br>
--but the words are their words.<br>
<p>
On another Note, Steve, I was not aware that you had a part in the "Lamp"<br>
software. Gary Russell sent me a copy (demo) of the Lamp. I never did get<br>
the Lamp because I was already involved in "Word Search."<br>

Steve Timm writes, "David P. notes that some of the Bible writers in the NT <br>
(and Jesus himself) didn't have the qualms that we have today concerning <br>
proper exegesis. Nancy Vyhmeister asked for some examples.  The most obvious <br>
place to start is the book of Matthew.  Try sometime reading Matthew in a <br>
translation such as the New American Standard, where every quote from the Old <br>
Testament is highlighted, then look up the context of these quotes in the OT. <br>
You will see Matthew's method of interpretation."<br>
<p>
You will also note that essentially all the quotations in the New Testament of<br>
Old Testament texts are quoted from the Septuagent(sp?) which is Greek <br>
translation and not from the original Hebrew.<br>

I read Cheryl's article with interest.  I was also upset by that<br>
Review article, for a slightly different reason.  I found that it<br>
misrepresented the character and actions of at least a couple of the<br>
independent ministries.  Also, it made no mention of the departure<br>
from divine counsel that has led to the formation of so many<br>
independent ministries.  A friend of mine who doesn't even like those<br>
ministries thought that that article was self-righteous.<br>
<p>
I think the church leadership panicked when there was a non-approved<br>
ordination at Steps to Life recently.  They feared that a new church<br>
was forming and acted a little irrationally.  I hope that things will<br>
calm down now and that they will correct some of the errors in that<br>
article.<br>

<i>&gt; All ,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hie everybody . This is Colin Chibafa and basically I'd just like to say</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've enjoyed being on the SDAnet , but unfortunately our University</i><br>
<i>&gt; closes next week (officially on the 12th of December , but I am leaving</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the 10th after my last exam) , and after that I don't think I will</i><br>
<i>&gt; have much access to the internet as I will be returning home to Bulawayo</i><br>
<i>&gt; ... a good 430 odd kilometres from here !</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have found the discussions interesting , although at times I've really</i><br>
<i>&gt; wondered what has become of us as Christians ... I'm refering to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; incidents regarding the mentally-ill and the last one regarding Joe and</i><br>
<i>&gt; his bathroom problems . I personally think throwing some-one from church</i><br>
<i>&gt; (of all places) , because they have some disagreeable personal traits</i><br>
<i>&gt; smacks of intollerance . Anyway , are we saying we are somehow of more</i><br>
<i>&gt; value before God than that poor individual  . I am sure we do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand the devastation this has on the poor guy . I feel so strongly</i><br>
<i>&gt; about this , because I have heard of the impact this can have on an</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual . Let me expound on that . This one guy happened to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; visiting South-Africa and on Sabbath decided to go to church .</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately , he went to to the "wrong" neighbourhood and to his</i><br>
<i>&gt; disbelief , a pastor whom he knew , but didn't really know him came to</i><br>
<i>&gt; him with the sad news that he was in the wrong church and offered him</i><br>
<i>&gt; the directions to the church where he would be more at home . this</i><br>
<i>&gt; pastor had once worked in Zimbabwe .</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This affected individual was really stunned . Talk of worshipping the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same God .</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyways , it always seems in such situations , how the Joes of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; world are affected is of no consequence as long as we are surrounded by</i><br>
<i>&gt; those we can tolerate ... no problem . I think a greater degree of</i><br>
<i>&gt; tolerance on our part is essential ... the church is not a social club</i><br>
<i>&gt; where only those of a certain class can be accepted as members !</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Besides that , it was well hearing from you all . God bless and I know</i><br>
<i>&gt; most likely we will never meet this side of heaven , but Lord willing i</i><br>
<i>&gt; hope to meet you all by the sea of Glass .</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Whatsoever things are true ... think upon such things !" - Phil. 4:8</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Colin</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; P.S. - I'd still like to remain on SDAnet up to the 9th of December!</i><br>

<p>
<p>
I don't know much about this so maybe someone can help be out. In the <br>
comment above it sounds like the E.G. White Estate is wanting to cash in<br>
on the newer form of media. If so, I thought the object here was to spread <br>
information not gain from the spreading of information. I guess I should<br>
really ask is who IS the E.G. White Estate?<br>
<p>

[Several conflicting statements have been made here about the copyright<br>
of the books themselves.  Ellen White's will dictated that a group of<br>
trustees should supervise the continued publication and translation<br>
of her writings, and profits earned from the royalties should be put back<br>
into supporting these efforts.  The trustees are members of the White Estate,<br>
which is housed at the offices of the General Conference in Silver Spring, MD<br>
and has set up research centers at various Adventist colleges around the <br>
world.  At first the estate was headed by Ellen G. White's son, then later<br>
by her grandson, but to my knowledge no relatives are currently involved.<br>
The trustees are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the General <br>
Conference of SDA.  As to any conspiracy, one should not attribute to <br>
conspiracy that which may be explained by inefficiency and indecision.  With<br>
the release of the CD-Rom it is claimed that all manuscripts of whatever<br>
sort that E.G. White wrote are now available to the public.  SCT]<br>

Paul Gates' mention of The Lamp and Word Search reminded me of my search<br>
for PC Bible search software a year or so ago.  There are all kinds of<br>
packages at all kinds of prices.  However, the package that I use is<br>
zero-cost shareware, i.e., "freeware":  OnLine Bible.<br>
<p>
OLB was originally developed by Larry Price in Ontario, Canada (a friend<br>
of mine met Larry; evidently he's a neat Christian and a real scholar); however,<br>
there are now numerous contributors (sorta like GNU and the Free Software<br>
Foundation), one of whom -- Mark Fuller -- works for Motorola here in Phoenix.<br>
Mark has made OLB 6.0 available for anonymous FTP via wuarchive.wustl.com<br>
(IP address 128.252.135.4) under /doc/bible/ibm-pc.  If you don't have<br>
Internet access, I know that some Christian shareware publishers carry it.<br>
<p>
The README.TXT file from wuarchive follows: -----------------------------------<br>
<p>
                       OnLine Bible version 6.<br>
                              FreeWare<br>

[Note: The Darby Bible was translated by John Nelson Darby, founder of<br>
the Plymouth Brethren.  The translation is similar in style and<br>
literalness to the NASB.  F.F. Bruce stated Darby's translation was the<br>
most accurate English translation.]<br>

Installation:<br>
 <br>
  The basic setup consists of the following modules:<br>
    1 OLB program<br>
   11 AV-Darby text modules<br>
    2 Cross Reference modules<br>
    4 Lexicon modules<br>
    4 Topic modules<br>
 <br>
  Installation must be done from floppy.  Before any installing can be<br>
  done, you must un'zip the modules to floppy disks.   All zip's are<br>
  designed to be unzipped from a hard disk onto one 360k floppy each. If<br>
  you are using a higher density disk you may place as many module<br>
  pieces on it as will fit on a disk.  For instance, if you are using<br>
  1.44 floppies.  You can put all the AV-DBY text modules on 3 disks,<br>
  laying them out in numerical order per disk.  Be sure to label the<br>
  disks so you can insert the correct disk when prompted.<br>
 <br>
  [Note: If you need pkunzip, it can be found at /mirrors/msdos/zip<br>
  filename is pkz110eu.exe.  This is a self extracting zip -- by<br>
  executing the program it will produce the pkunzip program.]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
First Time Install:<br>
 <br>
  Place the OLB program disk (the one you un'zipped OLBnnnn.ZIP onto) in<br>
  your drive and type: GO.  This will display some info and prompt you<br>
  to type INSTALL.<br>
 <br>
  Once the program portion of OLB is installed, an additional install<br>
  menu will appear.  By selecting 'a' on that menu, you may install<br>
  Texts, Cross Refs, Notes, Lexicons, etc.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Installing More Modules at a Later Date:<br>
 <br>
  Place your OLB program disk in the drive and type INSTALL.  The<br>
  Install program will sense you already have the programs installed and<br>
  will ask you if you want to re-install them.  Answer 'NO', and proceed<br>
  to the install screen where you can install more modules.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Assistance:<br>
 <br>
  If you are having problems with the install, try booting from a floppy<br>
  before running 'install'.<br>
 <br>
  If you are trying to run install from the hard disk, please go back a<br>
  few paragraphs and re-read the install instructions.  OLB is not<br>
  designed to install from the hard disk -- it must be done from floppy.<br>
 <br>
  A common problem reported is a 'crc' error due to unzipping on<br>
  a non-MS-DOS platform.  If you get a 'crc' error during install:<br>
  be sure you pkunziped in a real MS-DOS environment.<br>
 <br>
  If you need help, you may send e-mail to<br>
    acus10@waccvm.corp.mot.com<br>
 <br>
  Please provide some detail about the problem, your equipment, any<br>
  special software your running, etc.  And please provide your e-mail<br>
  address in your note.<br>

Although I am no longer a member of the SDA church, I still receive the<br>
Adventist Review regularly.  I don't know who's paying for it or having<br>
it sent to me, but I do read it with interest.  The December 3, 1992 NAD<br>
issue had an article about NAD action on private organizations which really<br>
caught my eye.  Here are my impressions--those of an outsider who has no<br>
knowledge or experience with the named organizations in the article.<br>
<p>
First, I was amazed at the seemingly unchristian attitude portrayed in the<br>
wording of the article.  Although it state specifically "this document is<br>
not presented in a spirit of combat or hostility" is reeks of that spirit.<br>
The words divisive or dissident appear in almost every paragraph.  There<br>
are strong words such as "accuse", "rival", "competition".  But the underlying<br>
motivition or thread in the article seemed to be that these private "divisive"<br>
organizations were successfully competing for tithe monies that the organized<br>
SDA church would like coming to their coffers.  Sample statements of this<br>
idea:  "They accuse the SDA church of activities which may encourage members<br>
to divert tithe to their private organizations rather than to the Church."<br>
"According to the Bible plan the Church is supported by tithes and offerings.<br>
When these private organizations seek or knowingly accept tithe for themselves,<br>
it thrusts at the heart of the individual Christian experience, for they are<br>
asking church members to switch loyalties away from God's plan to a rival<br>
plan."  "They threaten the viability of the Church when they encourage<br>
members to divert financial resources from the organized church to their<br>
private treasuries."<br>
<p>
I can understand the disappointment of SDA church members in the financial<br>
irresponsibility shown by Church leaders.  The Davenport Affair, the failure<br>
of Harris Pine Mills and numerous other financial blunders have left members<br>
wondering what they should do with their tithe.  At least these organizations<br>
seem to have a mission and use the money for gospel purposes.  What I don't<br>
understand is why this article can claim that an organized church setup in<br>
the way the SDA church is setup as "the Bible plan" or "God's plan".  For<br>
the Bible DOES NOT teach of any such plan or organization.  In the NT, the<br>
apostles were specifically chosen by Christ and replacement Apostles chosen<br>
by the remaining Apostles.  Nowhere does the Bible justify an elected<br>
leadership chosed by the an elite group.  Nowhere does the Bible teach that<br>
hierarchical leadership at Division, Union, Local Conference, Local <br>
congregation<br>
is "God's plan of church organization."  In the OT, religious leaders were<br>
chosen from the tribe of Levi and the tithing went to support them because<br>
they did no gainful employment to support themselves.  In the NT, the Church<br>
was financially organized as a community with all members owning assets<br>
jointly (a form of communism) and no individual owned anything outright.<br>
The present SDA organization doesn't resemble either of these two systems.<br>
<p>
I'd be interested in the observations of other SDAnetters on this article.<br>

<i>&gt; "According to the Bible plan the Church is supported by tithes and</i><br>
<i>&gt; offerings.</i><br>
<p>
Bingo.<br>
<p>
Another point was that these "divisive" groups actually had the<br>
audacity to schedule meetings during camp meeting times--a sure sign<br>
that they were trying to tear down Gods remnant church.<br>
<p>
The whole thing sounded rather petty to me.<br>
<p>
I am of the opinion that the SDA church is the only appropriate place to<br>
send your tithe, and that the groups mentioned (with the exception of<br>
Osborn's group) are clearly out of line.<br>
<p>
However, the method that the church is pursuing A) isn't going to<br>
win back any of the adherents to the divisive groups, and B) is irritating<br>
to loyal church members like myself, and C) just lends credibility to<br>
them by spending so much time berating them.<br>
<p>
I think the best strategy to pursue would be to simply lead by example:<br>
maintain the highest spiritual and fiscal standards in the leadership<br>
and operations of the church.  Instead of shutting down the divisive<br>
mills, just give them no grist.<br>

Steve made the comment that he attributes many of the "surface <br>
issues" such as lifestyle, standards, worship style etc. that<br>
the church is facing to a crisis in perceived church authority.<br>
<p>
I propose that the reason these issues have emerged is because<br>
of the way authority has been manifested in the past.<br>
<p>
Individuals who are governed by rules and regulations do not<br>
need to develop their own sense of ethics and principles. The<br>
sudden removal of the rules and regulations leaves that individual<br>
with no mature set of internalized principles and priorities.<br>
<p>
Rather than calling for a reversion to the rules and their<br>
extrinsic principles, it seems far more appropriate to aim<br>
towards maturity and responsibility within individuals. After <br>
all, one of the major differences between Catholicism and<br>
Protestantism (?) is that Catholics believe in Salvation through<br>
the organization, but protestants believe it's the individual's<br>
relationship with God that is important.<br>
<p>
It shouldn't be up to the church to act as our conscience.<br>

I think it's about time this whole situation was brought into the<br>
open and faced up to by everybody - the administration, the ministry,<br>
and the grass-roots membership.<br>
<p>
In Australia we don't have the diversity of independent ministries<br>
that exist in the US, but we certainly have our per capita fair share.<br>
They accuse the organisation of ignoring divine counsel or whatever,<br>
the organisation tries its hardest to ignore them, the conferences<br>
complain about tithe being diverted, and the situation continues to<br>
worsen.<br>
<p>
I would like to see some open discussion at an *official* church<br>
function like a special conference session or camp meeting. Individuals<br>
like me should be given the chance to hear what the opposing sides<br>
(let's face it - they are!) have to say, and make up our minds where<br>
we stand. This would also give us a chance to have *our* say, so that<br>
the church leadership would end up with some idea where the average<br>
church member stands on these issues.<br>
<p>
I'm tired of seeing the church (and others) attacked by publications<br>
such as "The Remnant Herald", "The Protestant", those anti-celebration<br>
videos, and a whole lot of other items I have been fortunate enough<br>
to avoid. It is also disturbing to see the church authorities responding<br>
in kind (well, almost).<br>
<p>
Sometimes it seems that the church will not take a stand on these issues<br>
because it may mean losing more tithe etc.  For the record, I for one<br>
would be prepared to contribute more if it came to that. I would much<br>
rather see the church *admit* that some of the things that are said<br>
are true - if indeed they are - rather than try and fend off the attacks.<br>
<p>
If the independent groups feel uncomfortable with the church's position,<br>
then by all means let them form their own denomination, "Reformed<br>
Seventh-day Adventist Church" or whatever, and let us get on with more<br>
constructive things.<br>
<p>

It seemed to me that the point the Church was trying to make<br>
is that the independent ministries mentioned were being dogmatic<br>
on interpretation of certain scripture details that the Church<br>
does not intend to define.  This gray area leaves room for many opinions,<br>
and by definition, one no more or less correct than the others.<br>
<p>
In 1888 the message of righteousness by faith was side tracked by<br>
differences of opinion in regard to the correct historical application<br>
of a prophecy (I've forgotten the details, but seem to remember to <br>
arguments were about the correct identification of the 10 kingdoms,<br>
or 'kings of the east'. I'll have to look up the details).<br>
It seems to me that any 'ministry' that spends the majority of it's<br>
time critisizing another for not holding the same opinions is side<br>
tracking the Church's mission.  Actions speak louder than words.<br>
<p>
Christ's second comming needs to be preached as imminent, and the good <br>
news of salvation shared with all who will listen.<br>

I like the comments which are being given, because they encourage me to<br>
believe that SDA young people aren't just reflecting other people's thoughts.<br>
The Church and it's institutions have helped you to be thinkers in your own<br>
right, even when you find yourself disagreeing in practice.<br>
<p>
I don't receive any church papers so don't know about the article first-hand.<br>
However, thanks to the Christian Behavioral Science/Social Work prof's. I was<br>
privilege to study under at Southern and Walla Walla College respectively,<br>
I dare believe to think that these "divisive" groups have sprung up because<br>
the church has failed to move in meeting the needs of the people.  Therefore,<br>
women who are denied equal recognition might not work to tare down the male<br>
establishment in the church, they simply put their money into their own work.<br>
<p>
Other "outcast" church groups do the same.  There is no need to panic, this is<br>
a part of God purifying His people.  However, let's pray that our <br>
church doesn't<br>
become a body where the brain tries to tell the fingernail, "I have no <br>
need of you."<br>

I saw the Autumn Council report on independent ministries. Interestingly,<br>
Good News Unlimited (GNU) was crossed out of the list this year although<br>
the Review article seemed to include them. Perhaps the Review went to<br>
press before the final vote. Several of the groups are particularly<br>
ascerbic. I must disagree with Reuben about Ron Spear's group. It is<br>
NOT supportive of the church. Perhaps the church had to make such a<br>
obvious statement for legal reasons. The church may legally want to<br>
separate itself from some of the things these groups are doing and<br>
relieve itself of liability for lawsuits. In addition, aligning with<br>
some of the activities of these groups without an official disclaimer<br>
sends messages of approval to some of the church membership that the <br>
church officially sanctions the viewpoints of these groups. There<br>
may be other reasons besides the collection of tithe which drove the<br>
church to release an official statement about these groups.<br>

Whenever I'm in Pittsburgh for a couple months, the reality is brought<br>
back to me that 95% of all the problems in the church are caused by <br>
poor communication.  When one considers who the leadership in the Washington<br>
Conference was at the time that Hope International--Our Firm Foundation<br>
got started, it's probable that the feud began with some interpersonal<br>
squabble which occured in the context of discussing some matter of faith<br>
or practice.<br>
<p>
Although I despise the tactics that are used by both sides, of carpet-bombing<br>
their opponent with all the quotes they can muster, I cannot fault them<br>
for propagandicating in the only way they know how.  For a good sixty years,<br>
this is the way it was done in the SDA church.  Denominational publications,<br>
contrary to what E.G. White and the Bible claim, claimed verbal inspiration<br>
for inspired writings.  By doing so they made these writings fair game to <br>
be used as weapons, and sowed the seed for dissent on the right which is<br>
occurring now and the dissent on the left of D. Ford and W. Rea which<br>
continues today.  We have sown the wind and now we are reaping the<br>
whirlwind.<br>
<p>
The SDA denomination was built around a consensus of people studying the<br>
Bible and building community out of a common understanding of truth.  <br>
We need to rediscover the path to building unity through consensus.  <br>
To say that the theological issues are not important is discrediting the <br>
Bible's place and Christ's place as the core of unity among SDA's. <br>
The theological differences are important, but I believe that consensus<br>
can be reached if the church leadership would come out from behind the <br>
fortress of authority and the opposition would stop carpet-bombing<br>
the denomination with missives.  <br>
<p>
I should also state that I think the reports of "the big bad hierarchy"<br>
and "Gulag mentality" are grossly overrated.  If everyone would stop<br>
being concerned with their own rights and having to win arguments,<br>
then the problem could be settled quickly, and we wouldn't have to have<br>
the inflated rhetoric which appears on both sides.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;   Catholic, as I find EGW defining it, is when ecclesiastic councils</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   rule over church doctrine and seek to rule conscience. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not so sure if this concept of "Catholic" is valid these</i><br>
<i>&gt; days.  </i><br>
<p>
I agree in that virtually all the Catholics with whom I have exchanged<br>
email have been surprisingly "Protestant" in their thinking.  They have<br>
told me they do not worship Mary, that they believe in Righteousness<br>
by faith and not works.  Quite often I had thought the newsgroup poster<br>
or the email writer was Protestant and then it turned out they were<br>
RCC.  So I think its fair to say that the gap between RCC and Protestant<br>
churches has narrowed considerably.  Catholics today are probably<br>
more Protestant perhaps than many of the Protestants back in Luther's<br>
day.<br>
<p>
Also, Carl Rehner (sp?) who is one of the leading Jesuit architects of<br>
ecumenical writes that there are those who are concerned for a grass<br>
roots rebellion among Protestants.  But he goes on to say, not to<br>
worry because Protestants have become as subservient to their church<br>
leaderships as Catholics are to their Pope.  Well, the RCC in this<br>
country are not nearly as subservient to their Pope as they are in<br>
other countries.  So, the parallel is probably true in the USA, but<br>
perhaps not as true as compared with RCC in say Rome or Spain.<br>

Just wanted to announce the arrival of Helen Faye Boram, November 15,<br>
7:46 p.m., 7 lbs. 1.5 oz., 20 inches.  This accounts for my silene<br>
(silence) on the the net recently.  I've had a lot of reading to do to<br>
catch back up with things.  But now I've got a modem I can read my<br>
mail at home rather than having to go to the university as I was doing<br>
previously.  Having a newborn in the house definitely affects my daily<br>
schedule...<br>

I am not absolutely sure that is the right subject for this message, but<br>
here it goes anyway.<br>
<p>
I read something in the post subjected "Goodbey!" and it reminded me of my<br>
Sabbath school discussion today.  It centered around an EGW quote from the<br>
lesson for Thursday:<br>
 <br>
"Marked diversities of disposition and character frequently exist in the<br>
same family, for it is the order of God that persons of varied temperment<br>
should associate together.  When this is the case, each member of the<br>
household should sacredly regard the feelings and respect the right of the<br>
others.  By this means mutual consideration and forbearance will be<br>
cultivated, prejudices will be softened, and rought points of character<br>
smoothed.  Harmony may be secured, and the blending of the varied<br>
temperaments may be a benefit to each."<br>
<p>
Now this does not specifically address the race item brought up in that<br>
one letter, but the issue brought out from it does.  The time to work on<br>
getting along with other people of varied temperament is now.  And I think<br>
one could say the same about race.  What are those people going to do in<br>
heaven?  I don't think bigotry will get through the door.  Now is the time<br>
to fully submit our entire being to God.  If a sin is found by the nudging<br>
of the Spirit then by the Spirit's power it ought to be fought against. <br>
One thing that impressed me about Steps to Christ and Great Controversy<br>
was the stress on not holding back on any sin.  100% must be given up. <br>
The point I got was that if you see a sin in your life, then admit that it<br>
is a problem and agree with the Holy Spirit and right then put the problem<br>
before God.  <br>

<i>&gt; In the NT, the Church</i><br>
<i>&gt; was financially organized as a community with all members owning assets</i><br>
<i>&gt; jointly (a form of communism) and no individual owned anything outright.</i><br>
<p>
I've heard this in the US, in Europe, and in Africa.  However,<br>
I don't see Scripture as supporting anything close to communism.<br>
Let me elaborate:  Communism involves centralized ownership and control<br>
of assets, under the guise of representing the masses in so doing.<br>
However, I believe I can demonstrate that private ownership was maintained<br>
and private enterprise practised in NT times (quite the opposite from<br>
communism), notably in a manner that gave glory to God.<br>
<p>
  Acts 2:44 And all that believed were together, and had all things in common.<br>
<p>
I grant that this sounds at first blush like a form of communism, but I find<br>
that a closer examination of what "all things in common" means is revealed<br>
by studying the context which suggests something quite different (NIV and<br>
others have helpful renderings, btw).<br>
<p>
  v. 45 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,<br>
  as every man had need.<br>
<p>
Observe that you cannot sell or share what you do not own (except as a<br>
representative of a corporate body, which I believe is disproved later).<br>
Note also that the selling or sharing ("parting") was done on an as-needed<br>
basis to individuals/families, not without exception a-priori into some<br>
corporate "kitty" (altho that also was done; see on) as a corporate communal<br>
form of property-holding would require.<br>
<p>
  Acts 4:32 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and<br>
  of one soul:  neither SAID any of them that ought of the things which he<br>
  possessed was his own; but they had all things common. [emph supplied]<br>
<p>
If you grab the last phrase, it does sound again like communal property.<br>
However, the prior phrases must be used to illuminate it.  Note the<br>
one-ness of spirit and love and compassion towards each other that they had,<br>
a direct fulfillment of Jesus' prayer in John 17.  It was this attitude,<br>
couple with an awareness of Deut 8:18, Ps 50:10, et al, and obedience to<br>
Prov 11:24,26, et al, that compelled them to view ("said") or consider<br>
(but not a legal fact) their possessions as not their own.  Specifically,<br>
not their own to use as they pleased but a trust to employ for God's glory<br>
(cf. 1 Cor 6:20; also Phil 2:6 in a modern translation, spec re "grasp").<br>
<p>
  v. 34,35 Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were<br>
  POSSESSORS of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the<br>
  things that were sold, and laid them down at the apostles' feet: and<br>
  distribution was made unto every man according as he had need. [emph suppl]<br>
<p>
Note again the clear legal situation:  private owners (not corporate<br>
representatives) selling to other private owners, then taking the money<br>
and turning it in for distribution on an as-needed basis (which, btw,<br>
given I Tim 5:8, is distinctly different from today's government welfare).<br>
These verses are then followed by the stories of Barnabas and Ananias &amp;<br>
Sapphira.  While the emphasis in the latter case is upon their duplicity<br>
and self-glorification, which dishonored God, both cases clearly indicate<br>
private ownership.<br>
<p>
As for private enterprise, see Acts 18:3 or John 21:3.<br>

Fred Christiansen made some timely comments about how one is to treat<br>
the leaders of the church (Paul's experience), and Tim Swensen has<br>
raised some<br>
interesting questions.  <br>
<p>
The essential with trying to reach the unchurched is that eventually you<br>
establish a church, and the problems in general of maintaining a church<br>
tend to distract from the primary mission of the church which is to<br>
spread God's love.  In general, people go to church to regain security<br>
as they face their fears of the afterlife.  "...so take my hand, and<br>
tell me what it costs to <br>
see the promised land...I'm getting sleepier."<br>
<p>
You will find that every organized religion has some method of "eternal<br>
security maintenance" after people first join their church.  For Islam<br>
it is prayer 5 times a day, for Catholics it's attending mass, for<br>
Baptists and the like it's continuing to believe hard enough to be<br>
saved, and for SDA's it has been the lifestyle (for so many years). <br>
Leaders tell people<br>
what to believe because most of the masses just ask what to believe.  It's<br>
neater to have a nice box of beliefs than to think them out for yourself.<br>
Maybe someday they will even make a computer program to make it easier to <br>
"Make believe, not war."  When the package of beliefs is "The Truth",<br>
an exclusive channel to Eternal Life (provided you work at it hard enough),<br>
it's even easier to feel comfortable in such a system.<br>
<p>
(We never have resolved on the net whether or not it is Christian to <br>
keep veteran church members feeling "lukewarm and fuzzy", but I digress).<br>
<p>
The difficulty we face now is that the pocket of the church, North America,<br>
is financially dependent on those who have come to expect their<br>
"lukewarm fuzzies"  from the church in return for the tithe.  Some of<br>
the more candid<br>
conference presidents admit that pastors are there to serve tithepayers.<br>
Because the leadership catered to the desires, rather than the needs,<br>
of the denomination in the past, the present leadership which by and large<br>
does want to address the needs finds itself in a dilemma.  If it dares to <br>
bite the hands that feed it, we will have a transition to the world <br>
of post-institutional Adventism sooner than anyone planned.<br>
<p>
The recourse being applied in response to the crisis is to threaten loss<br>
of the spiritual security blanket if the tithe is not paid to the<br>
organization which provides it.  It may work for some.  Ironically, even<br>
as all the concern about tithe is expressed, fiscal 1992 for the church<br>
was the first time we had been in the black for several years.<br>
<p>
With due respect to Fred's comments about spiritual leaders, we are not<br>
governed by a theocracy in the SDA church.  We should, however, apply<br>
the principle "Whosoever would be greatest among you, let him be your<br>
servant."  From my contacts with the leadership, it seems to me that<br>
they are trying very hard to do just that.  The leadership's job is to<br>
make available to the local church resources and services it could not<br>
provide for itself.  If they are slightly more visionary, they could<br>
also help to coordinate activities between other churches in the<br>
jurisdiction.  If slightly less visionary, <br>
then all I expect is for them to stay out of my way, and not hinder growth<br>
at the local level (they have done this admirably so far.)<br>

In the middle of a presentation on Biblical diet, I was struck by the<br>
fact that there are some other commandments other than the ten that are<br>
and have for a long time been part of SDA life, namely tithing and abstention<br>
from unclean meats.  <br>
<p>
I don't mean to question the validity of these two commands at all, but<br>
I wonder:  <br>
1)  Are there any other common duties incumbent on the SDA church member,<br>
in particular are any others sworn to in the baptismal vow?  I don't<br>
remember others.<br>
<p>
2)  Why don't we also make church members forswear such sins as pride and <br>
jealousy and contentiousness before baptism?<br>
<p>
As I think on #1 above the prohibitions against smoking and drinking<br>
come to mind.  But I would like to hear others, hopefully with Bible<br>
texts to back <br>
them up.<br>

Dave's comment about Catholics calls to mind my (former SDA) friend <br>
in South Africa.  She is feminist, lesbian, revolutionary (card-carrying<br>
member of African Natl. Congress), and yet she sees no conflict with<br>
being a Catholic and has even talked from time to time of entering a convent.<br>
Catholics of her stripe make a big deal about the fact that the various<br>
pronouncements of the pope on such things as abortion and the role of<br>
women have not been declared infallible.<br>
<p>
Many times in the general end-times persecution complex of SDA's, we<br>
look for signs of unity between Catholics and Protestants, and the union<br>
of both of these with spiritualism, because it is these three in<br>
conjunction and not the Catholics alone who will form the opposition to<br>
Christ at the end.  I would warn that it is not necessary for an<br>
opposition to be unified to do damage.  Consider the Sadducees and<br>
Pharisees of the time of Christ.  They hated each other.  But all that<br>
mattered was that they hated Christ for the same reasons that they hated<br>
each other, and they cooperated enough to get rid of Him.<br>
<p>
I think it will be the same way at the end of time.  In this case it<br>
will be antipathy towards the law of God and those who keep it that will<br>
be the temporary unifying factor.<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
Maybe some of you can provide some answers.  What is it that we expect our<br>
spiritual leaders to provide us?  What distinctions do we see in the roles<br>
of pastors, conference leaders, etc, vs. those of laypersons?  In what ways<br>
can we lighten the burdens our leaders bear?<br>
<p>
The premium we place upon knowing the scriptures for ourselves is certainly<br>
appropriate; but isn't it easy to let this spirit of independence spill over<br>
into contempt for group efforts and rejection of the concept of spiritual<br>
authority in general?  Come to think of it, what concept of authority do you<br>
folks subscribe to?  I've not studied this much, and I'd welcome some insights<br>
into this area.<br>
<p>
Relating to the present debate (certain independent ministries), what do we<br>
expect our leaders to do when organizations openly ask for tithe, imply that<br>
large numbers of our pastors are spiritually poisoning the flock from the <br>
pulpit, (I'm referring to Ralph Larson's article on tithe in Our Firm <br>
Foundation), and basically set themselves up as the true preservers of the<br>
original, pure SDA doctrine.  I really don't know what the best course of <br>
action is.  Does someone have a reference handy to some timely Scripture <br>
(beyond the counsels in Matthew) and EGW on this matter.  From what I am<br>
hearing on SDAnet, it sounds like the public confrontation method is not the<br>
way to proceed.<br>
<p>
Finally, I must take issue with Cheryl's insinuation that the book "Issues:<br>
The Seventh-day Adventist Church and Certain Private Ministries" is basically<br>
a ploy to rake in revenue for the ABC's.  Isn't this a bit cynical?<br>
<p>
Thanks for the replies,<br>
<p>

In response to Pam Harris' comment that some of the ministries do<br>
not support the church, let me state that all of the named ministries<br>
(I think) encourage people to remain members of the organized SDA<br>
church.  None of these ministries actively solicit tithe.  I think<br>
most of these ministries spend more time promoting what they see as<br>
truth rather than attacking others.  On all three points the Review<br>
pamphlet gave a wrong impression.  So I would agree with Ruben that<br>
these ministries do support the official church organization, though<br>
some of them do accept tithe money and some of them do point out<br>
what they see as problems in the church.  Also, I think that the<br>
quotations from Firm Foundation given in that article gave a<br>
non-representative view of what the magazine is like.  I would hope<br>
people would actually look at the magazine and not make decisions<br>
based on what the article quoted.  Also, Hope International and<br>
Hartland did NOT support the ordination at Steps to Life, contrary<br>
to the implication in the article.  These ministries tend to represent<br>
the conservative viewpoint within Adventism.  Some may not agree with<br>
that.  But I think still it's important to be fair.  This lack of<br>
fairness is one of the things that disturbed me most about that<br>
Review pamphlet.<br>

While reading the first verses in Acts 23 last night, I was impressed with<br>
how relevant they were to some of our current discussions; particularly,<br>
how to respond towards church authorities when you think they're in the<br>
wrong.  Note that I do not mean to infer that current church authorities<br>
are anything like Ananias or the council.<br>
<p>
Note the context:  Paul has been placed under arrest without charge,<br>
narrowly escaped being flogged with a cruel scourge, and is now before<br>
the Sanhedrin for, well, inquisition.  In ch.21 it had been alleged<br>
by enemies that he had acted contrary to God's laws.  Hence his opening<br>
statement:<br>
<p>
  v.1 And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren,<br>
  I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.<br>
  v.2 And the high priest Ananias command them that stood by him to smite<br>
  him on the mouth.<br>
<p>
This council is now well in the groove of flouting Jewish law for the<br>
selfish purposes of preserving their position, having already done so<br>
with Jesus, his brother James, Stephen, and various other disciples.<br>
Paul's statement condemns them in what little conscience they have left.<br>
This is such an irritation that anger explodes, Ananias commanding<br>
"slap his mouth!" as if to right some insult to God.<br>
<p>
  v.3 Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whitened wall:<br>
  for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be<br>
  smitten contrary to the law?<br>
<p>
At this point Ananias is dead wrong and Paul, relative to the law, is<br>
dead right.  Thumbs down on Ananias, thumbs up for Paul.  Go for it!<br>
Sock it to him, pal!  You have a right to be righteously indignant!  So,<br>
we all line up on Paul's side and try to look, well, imposing if not tough.<br>
<p>
  v.4 And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?<br>
  v.5 Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest:<br>
  for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.<br>
<p>
Instead of saying, "And he's a lousy excuse for a high priest", or even<br>
"In God's sight he's no high priest of God because he has departed from<br>
God's laws", Paul apologizes.  Apologizes, so help me!  This seems totally<br>
opposite to what you or I might think was the righteous thing to do.<br>
Paul says "I'm sorry.  I was wrong.  I didn't know he was the high priest.<br>
The law says: ...".  I believe Paul is being genuine here, that he did not<br>
know the person speaking was the high priest; this is no protect-your-<br>
posterior dissembling.<br>
<p>
The verse that Paul quotes is Exodus 22:28 (not word for word, but the<br>
spirit of it).  The attitude and expression enjoined, that Paul demonstrated,<br>
finds resonance in David's attitude towards Saul (numerous refs, e.g.,<br>
1 Sam 24).  David understood (cf. Ps 105:15, Prov 21:1) that THOSE IN<br>
AUTHORITY RECEIVE THAT AUTHORITY FROM GOD AND ARE THUS DUE RESPECT IN<br>
*EVERY* WAY, even when doing wrong.  Jesus clearly understood this principle<br>
in His response to Pilate in John 19:11.  Further evidence from Paul<br>
on this principle:  I Tim 2:1-3, Rom 13:1-7, Tit 3:1,2.  From Peter:<br>
I Pet 2, esp v.11-17.<br>
<p>
That this principle re civil authority applies also to the church<br>
can be seen in this verse:  "Pay proper respect to this who work<br>
among you, THOSE WHOM THE LORD HAS CHOSEN to guide and instruct you"<br>
[emph supplied].  (I learned this from listening to tape of memory verses<br>
put to music by, I believe, Wayne Hooper.  Unfortunately, I cannot find<br>
the music book or the tape, both of which we have but buried away somewhere.<br>
I imagine it's the NIV rendering.  Can someone help me on this?)<br>
<p>
What then does the Bible say about responding to those in authority, when<br>
they do wrong, in order to rectify things?  I would like to encourage some<br>
discussion re this.  I'll post my Scripture findings after I see some responses.<br>
Note that I dearly hope to see Scripture-based material (cf. Isa 55 and 65:2).<br>

Well you may be right, my information is a few years old but the last time<br>
I heard they were still supportive of the church. Mind you being in Australia<br>
means my info regarding these things is rather sketchy at best.<br>

Steve Timm will be on business from Dec.7 to Dec. 17 in Berkeley, CA,<br>
during which time his net access will be spotty at best.  (SDA-L and SDAnet<br>
members in Berkeley, please get in touch!)  After this he will be on<br>
vacation from Dec. 22 to Dec. 31 in Traverse City, MI  (home for the<br>
holidays)  with no net access at all.<br>
<p>
This means SDAnet postings will be slow, and for the last week of Dec.<br>
will be nonexistent.  SDA-L member services such as SET NOMAIL and<br>
SIGNOFF will also be slowed.  However, messages sent to SDA-L@LLUVM.Bitnet<br>
will get through normally.  (SDAnet members can post to that address<br>
only if you have sent the following commands to LISTSERV@LLUVM.BITNET<br>
<p>
SUBSCRIBE SDA-L Your Name<br>
<p>
and (in another message)<br>
<p>
SET NOMAIL SDA-L<br>
<p>
(If you don't do the latter you will get double copies of any SDA-L<br>
message.  As listed above you can post to SDA-L but you will receive<br>
messages from it through the SDAnet echo as always. )<br>

The GO '92 missions conference will be held from December 27-31, 1992<br>
at Andrews University.  The first GO conference last year resulted in<br>
many people committing to short-term and long-term mission service, and<br>
helped people to find specific mission opportunities while still at the<br>
conference.  If someone could post the list of speakers and workshops<br>
again,<br>
I'd be much obliged.<br>

items that we vow to uphold during baptism.  My wife and I had a lengthy<br>
discussion aboiut this topic after a recent baptism.  The vows stated <br>
that the person could not use or sell tobacco, alcahol, caffinated beverages<br>
or other unhealthy items.  This would obviously preclude a person from <br>
getting a job at a 7-11 or a grocery store or gas station or any other <br>
establishment that served or sold these items.  This would also include<br>
many resturants.  And if taken to extreame would even include any establishment<br>
that has a vending machine that dispenses such items.  <br>
<p>
We have definately come to a point that we don't have any tolerance for <br>
others beliefs on issues.  I am not a vegetarian although my wife is, and<br>
I get repeated attacks as to how unhealthy eatting meat is and that one of<br>
these days I will grow enough in my faith that I will want to give up <br>
flesh foods.  I enjoy a good steak still and the constant haranging of <br>
my fellow christians as to my dietary practices just angers me and makes <br>
me dig my heels in even deeper in regards to eating meat.  <br>
<p>
What ever happened to shareing the gospel of a crucified and risen<br>
Christ and his wonderful salvation instead of a new set of <br>
"phariseical" laws. <br>

Ten + two?  I thought there were 27  8-)<br>
<p>
A few weeks ago we had a guest sermon by a Conferance man.  He made<br>
quite a point of saying that the 27 fundamentals are core SDA theology<br>
and that everything outside of the 27 fundamentals are basically<br>
curiosities of Adventism and not to be taken too seriously.  He said<br>
that a big problem he has with the independents is that they continue<br>
to try to bring to importance those theological issues that are not<br>
part of the 27.<br>
<p>

<p>
[...]<br>
Relating to the present debate (certain independent ministries), what do we<br>
expect our leaders to do when organizations openly ask for tithe, imply that<br>
large numbers of our pastors are spiritually poisoning the flock from the<br>
pulpit, (I'm referring to Ralph Larson's article on tithe in Our Firm<br>
Foundation), and basically set themselves up as the true preservers of the<br>
original, pure SDA doctrine.  I really don't know what the best course of<br>
action is.  Does someone have a reference handy to some timely Scripture<br>
(beyond the counsels in Matthew) and EGW on this matter.  From what I am<br>
hearing on SDAnet, it sounds like the public confrontation method is not the<br>
way to proceed.<br>
[...]<br>
_______________________________________________________________________________<br>
This kind of situation has happened before.  A splinter group was preaching a <br>
different interpretation of scripture than the mainstream church held, and <br>
insisting that their interpretation was the correct one.  The church governing <br>
body had tried ordering them to stop, with no effect, and was now meeting to <br>
consider some rather drastic direct action.  You can read about it in Acts <br>
5:27-42.  I think the advice Gamaliel gave to the Sanhedrin was excellent then, <br>
and is equally applicable today.  "So in the present case I tell you, keep away <br>
from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this undertaking is of <br>
men, it will fail; but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them.  <br>
You might even be found opposing God!" [Acts 5:38,39]<br>
<p>
The mission of the SDA church is to bring the gospel, as presented in the three <br>
angels' messages, to the world.  The church leadership should spend their energy <br>
on that mission, and these other problems will take care of themselves.  If the <br>
assessment stated in the Review is correct, these groups will fade away.  But if <br>
a mistake has been made, then all the position papers and attacks that can be <br>
made will not prevail.<br>
<p>
(By the way, several months ago a similar insert appeared in the Southwestern <br>
Union Record.  It was written by the Conference President, and in my opinion the <br>
tone was such that it had no business appearing in any publication that claimed <br>
to be Christian.  I read the article while visiting in Texas, but I didn't keep <br>
it and can't provide a reference.)<br>
<p>
We get _Our Firm Foundation_ and it is in general a fine magazine.  I don't <br>
necessarily agree with all points, but the articles on church history, doctines, <br>
and EGW reprints are mostly excellent.  (I skip Ron Spear's editorials.)  On the <br>
other hand, I've seen some of John Osborne's tapes, and they're definitely not <br>
constructive.  <br>
<p>
I think the church leadership is harming themselves by their efforts to silence <br>
critics.  In most cases disfellowshipping and loss of ministerial credentials is <br>
based on refusal to submit to church authority, rather than on doctrinal or <br>
theological differences.  Yet the "dissidents" base their insubordination on <br>
theological reasons.  These issues should be thoroughly examined before further <br>
action is taken, like was done with Ford.  After all, Adventists take the Bible <br>
as the ultimate authority, not pronouncements from the church hierarchy.  (At <br>
least they used to.)<br>
<p>
Sorry I got a little carried away here.  You might guess that it's been a matter <br>
of some discussion at our house.  While I don't believe that the "Celebration" <br>
worship style is bad, or that I'm being hypnotized on Sabbath morning by a <br>
pastor trained in "neurolinguistic programming", I think at times style may be <br>
emphasized at the expense of substance and specialized techniques at the expense <br>
of presenting the gospel.  Neither side is entirely right or entirely wrong, and <br>
I try to keep my focus on Jesus rather than joining the fight on one side or the <br>
other.<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
A correction to my previous post regarding independent ministries:<br>
<p>
The article I referred to in "Our Firm Foundation" by Ralph Larson did<br>
not say explicitly, "Send us your tithe."  What it did was ask rhetorically,<br>
"How can you financially support an organization which is in some degree<br>
of apostacy?" (Note a direct quote;  I am paraphrasing.)  While the author <br>
encourages the readers to support those pastors that are upholding the <br>
teachings of historic adventism, I have real problems with the way he sows <br>
distrust and division in the article; nonetheless, I should not have accused <br>
him of asking EXPLICITLY for tithe.<br>
<p>
Like others, I also am concerned that the Review article and insert may do <br>
more harm than good.<br>

I have read with interest the many comments about independent ministries<br>
posted to SDAnet.  I admit ignorance about much of the goals and platforms of<br>
the dissident groups but I am no stranger to conflict within our Church<br>
family, having come of age during the time of Walter Rea, Desmond Ford and<br>
the Davenport scandal.   The apostles faced instances of dissention and error<br>
in the New Testament and I believe their experiences can help us today.<br>
<p>
First, with regard to the question of whether there is only one source of<br>
truth here on earth, the Bible is clear.  Only Christ can offer salvation ("I<br>
am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved" John 10:9).  However,<br>
no man or system can control God's grace because it is free gift to all who<br>
place their trust in Him ("Therefore, since we have been justified through<br>
faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we<br>
have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand.  And we<br>
rejoice in the hope of the glory of God." Rom 5:1-2). <br>
<p>
 Paul faced the problem of believers misplacing their allegences to the<br>
messengers rather than to the gospel message.  This is described in 1 Cor. 3<br>
where he says: "For since there is jealousy and quareling among you, are you<br>
not worldly?  Are your not acting like mere men?  For when one says, 'I<br>
follow Paul,' and another 'I follow Apollos,' are your not mere men?  What,<br>
after all is Apollos?  And what is Paul?  Only servants, through whom you<br>
came to believe-as the Lord has assigned to each his task.  I planted the<br>
seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow." ... "By the grace God has<br>
given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is<br>
building on it.  But each one should be careful how he builds.  For no one<br>
can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus<br>
Christ.  If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly<br>
stones, wood, hay or straw, his work will be shown for what it is because the<br>
Day will bring it to light. (1 Cor. 3:3-6, 10-13).  Paul was a "slave of<br>
Christ" and gave him both the glory and the control of His message.<br>
<p>
This is not to suggest that the apostles did not correct one another.  Quite<br>
the contrary.  Consider the public correction administered to Peter by Paul<br>
on the issue of associating with gentiles: "When Peter came to Antioch, I<br>
opposed him to his face because he was clearly in the wrong.  Before certain<br>
men came from James, he used to eat with the gentiles.  But when they<br>
arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the gentiles...The<br>
other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocracy even<br>
Barnabas was led astray.  When I saw that they were not acting in line with<br>
the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of them all, 'You are a<br>
Jew, yet you live like a gentile and not like a Jew.  How is it, than, that<br>
you force gentiles to follow Jewish customs?"  Gal 2:11-14.  Peter, also a<br>
loyal slave of Christ, accepted Paul's counsel even though it was<br>
administered in a public and probably humiliating fashion.  This is not<br>
seemingly the case with all teachers as is described in 1Tim.1.  Here Paul is<br>
instructing the believers to<br>
 "command certain men not to teach false doctrines any longer nor to devote<br>
themselves to myths and endless genealogies.  These promote controversies<br>
rather than God's work-which is by faith.  The goal of this command is love,<br>
which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. <br>
Some have wandered away from these and turned to meaningless talk.  They want<br>
to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about<br>
or what they so confidently affirm"  and he states that the criteria for<br>
determining fitness for teaching is if the teaching "conforms to the glorious<br>
gospel" (1Tim.1:3-7,11)<br>
<p>
I would draw the following conclusions based upon these examples from the<br>
apostolic church.<br>
 1.  Since salvation is a free gift from God through Christ, we must not fall<br>
into another of the traps the Galations fell into, namely being more<br>
concerned about the messenger and subtle nuances of the message than about<br>
the transforming power of the grace of Christ.  Paul called himself a slave<br>
of Christ.  Perhaps we Seventh-day Adventists, both individually and as a<br>
church, would not suffer from such division if we all considered ourselves<br>
slaves of Christ and allowed our Master to fight his own battles.  (I am<br>
writing to myself as much to any reader or Church leader.)<br>
<p>
2.  When the goal is the teaching of "the glorious gospel", different<br>
messengers or groups will not conflict and when strains arise they are<br>
settled by appealing to the authority of the cross.  Spiritual pride will<br>
paralyze any progress toward spreading the gospel as we self-destruct in a<br>
paroxsym of hypocracy.  Unfortunately, our leadership nurtures this problem<br>
on occasion as do the leaders of the many of the antagonistic independent<br>
ministries.  To be honest, I have found it in my own heart at times.  We all<br>
need to appeal to the authority of the cross.  Now is not the time to allow<br>
the message of salvation by faith in Christ to be sidetracked by a modern<br>
version of the argument about the identities of the 10 horns in Daniel as<br>
happened in 1888.<br>
<p>
3.  Financial support through tithe paying is not addressed in these stories,<br>
but I would recommend that the Church focus on spreading the gospel and God<br>
will handle the financial details.  As Gamaliel wisely noted, movements which<br>
are of God flourish, the rest fade away and those independent ministries that<br>
are currently sapping the financial strenght of the church are a small amount<br>
of funds compared to the larger number of believers who have drifted away<br>
during our years of self-destructive paralysis.<br>
  <br>
Thank you for reading, this post got a little out of hand!<br>

I'm intrigued by some of the comments about independent thinking and on<br>
church leadership.  Out of curiosity, I read some very relevant pages<br>
in Acts of the Apostles by EGW which speak directly to these issues.  In<br>
fact, the book is peppered with crises within the church and how the early<br>
 church responded to these internal threats.  For example, look at this<br>
passage:<br>
<p>
	God has made His church on the earth the channel of light, and<br>
	through it He communicates His purposes and His will.  He does<br>
	not give one of His servants an experience independent of and<br>
	contrary to the experience of the church itself.  Neither does<br>
	He give one man knowledge of His will for the entire church<br>
	while the church--Christ's body--is left in darkness.  In His<br>
	providence He places His servants in close connection with His<br>
	church in order that they may have less confidence in themselves<br>
	and greater confidence in others whom He is leading out to<br>
	advance His work.<br>
<p>
	There have ever been in the church those who are constantly<br>
	inclined toward individual independence.  They seem unable to<br>
	realize that independence of spirit is liable to lead the human<br>
	agent to have too much confidence in himself and to trust in<br>
	his own judgment rather than to respect the counsel and highly<br>
	esteem the judgement of his brethren, especially of those in<br>
	the offices that God has appointed for the leadership of His<br>
	people.  God has invested His chuirch with special authority<br>
	and pwer which no one can be justified in disregarding and<br>
	despising, for he who does this despises the voice of God.<br>
<p>
	Those who are inclined to regard their individual judgment as<br>
	supreme are in grave peril.  It is Satan's studied effort to<br>
	separate such ones from those who are channels of light, through<br>
	whom God has wrought to build up and extend His work in the<br>
	earth.  To neglect or despise those whom God has appointed to<br>
	bear the responsibilities of leadership in connection with the<br>
	advancement of the truth, is to reject the means that He has<br>
	ordained for the help, encouragement, and strength of His people.<br>
	For any worker in the Lord's cause to pass these by, and to think<br>
	that his light must come through no other channel than directly<br>
	from God, is to palce himself in a position where he is liable<br>
	to be deceived by the enemy and overthrown.  The Lord in His<br>
	wisdom hass arranged that by means of the close relationship<br>
	that should be maintained by all believers, Christian shall be<br>
	united to Christian and church to church.  Thus the human<br>
	instrumentality will be enabled to co-operate with the divine.<br>
	Every agency will be subordinate to the Holy Spirit, and all<br>
	the believers will be united in an organized and well-directed<br>
	effort to give to the world the glad tidings of the grace of<br>
	God.<br>
<p>
			AA p. 163-164<br>
<p>
For specifics discussion on tithe paying and the liberal support of church<br>
work, see AA Chapter 32.  A very specific remedy for lukewarmness:<br>
"Spiritual prosperity is closely bound up with Christian liberality."  p. 344<br>
<p>
What about disunity in the church?  Try this statement:<br>
<p>
	The hearts of those who had been converted under the labors of<br>
	the apostles, were softened and united by Christian love.  Despite<br>
	former prejudices, all were in harmony with one another.  Satan<br>
	knew that so long as this union continued to exist, he would be<br>
	powerless to check the progress of the gospel truth; and he sought<br>
	to take advantage of former habits of thought, in hope that<br>
	thereby he might be able to introduce into the church elements of<br>
	disunion.<br>
<p>
	Thus it came to pass that as the disciples were multiplied, the<br>
	enemy succeeded in arousing the suspicions of some who had formerly<br>
	been in the habit of looking with jealousy on their brethren in the<br>
	faith and of finding fault with their spiritual leaders.<br>
<p>
			AA. p. 88<br>
<p>
	Only as they were united in Christ could the disciples hope to<br>
	have the accompanying power of the Holy Spirit and the co-operation<br>
	of the angels of heaven.  With the help of these divine agencies<br>
	they would present before the world a united front and would be<br>
	victorious in the conflict they were compelled to wage unceasingly<br>
	against the powers of darkness.  As they should continue to labor<br>
	unitedly, heavenly messengers would go before them, opening the<br>
	way; hearts would be prepared for the reception of truth, and<br>
	many would be won to Christ.  So long as they remained united, the<br>
	church would go forth. . ."<br>
<p>
			AA p. 91<br>
<p>
There seems to be amble recommendations from your prophet in what to do.<br>
Maybe what the members of the SDA church needs to do is read what she<br>
has said about this specifically and then prayerfully apply these principles<br>
in each individual life.<br>
<p>
As a member of the LDS Church now, I really cherish to unity which I find<br>
within the body of Christ.  Each member sustains our church leaders and<br>
accept their leadership.  To be baptized into the LDS Church, you are asked<br>
specifically if you are willing to sustain the church authorities and to<br>
abide by their counsel.  The church authorities ALWAYS give a unified and<br>
singular voice to the members in theology, Christian principles, and in<br>
church organization and business.  That doesn't mean that I, as an individual<br>
member, may not have personal revelation and knowledge.  But whatever I<br>
receive is meant for me personally and does not apply to the body of Christ.<br>
Only God-appointed church leaders can give revelation for the church.  It<br>
is not my responsibility, right, or duty to influence, stir, or dictate<br>
theology to the leaders.  By sustaining my church leaders, I agree to uphold<br>
them, to not criticize or find fault with them, and to acknowledge that they<br>
are led of God.  Doesn't that make everything much simpler?<br>

Should baptism really be complicated by so many vows? One would think<br>
that if a person has accepted Christ, he would have the Holy Spirit<br>
and the bible to guide him in deciding what is right and wrong. I mean,<br>
when Jesus or anyone else in the bible was baptised, did they have to<br>
swear never to walk more than a mile on Sabbath or to always wash their<br>
hands before eating? What is baptism all about anyway?<br>

On vegetarianism, I myself am a vegetarian, but I don't see it as a sin<br>
to eat meat. Didn't Jesus eat meat? Weren't some of his disciples fishermen?<br>
All Jews had to eat the passover lamb, I don't think that there were many<br>
vegetarians then. Of course, it is good to be vegetarian, but to make such a<br>
big deal out of it is to major in minors.<br>
	Haven't we as a church got better things to do than spend time on<br>
arguing about minor details? (cf. Rom 14) <br>
	God bless,<br>

Hi I'm first year science student.  I'm preparing for my final exam.  But<br>
one of my computer science happens to be this friday 6pm.  It's well over<br>
sunset and I don't want to write it since it's sabbath. <br>
I only have few days left and I don't know what to do?  I don't even know<br>
if the professor will be in his office.  And I need to know to whom I have<br>
to go to get a permission to postpone my exam till sabbath is over.<br>

<p>
[First you should try to go to the professor.  If you can't find the<br>
professor, ask one of the secretaries in the department.  They should<br>
know<br>
if you can talk to the department head or if you need to go higher.<br>
You may also find that your negotiation position is improved if you <br>
ask to take the exam before instead of after, because this way they cannot <br>
acuse you of just not being ready.  Also there will be less worries about<br>
you talking to other people who have taken the test.<br>
<p>
Before you go to your professor, make sure you know your school's policy <br>
on religious discrimination.  SCT]<br>

<i>&gt; Should baptism really be complicated by so many vows? One would think</i><br>

<i>&gt; swear never to walk more than a mile on Sabbath or to always wash their</i><br>
<i>&gt; hands before eating? What is baptism all about anyway?</i><br>
<p>
I am inclined to agree with you here. I did not realise that there was a<br>
specific list of things an intending SDA committed themselves to (eg not <br>
smoking, and the other things someone else listed) before baptism.<br>
<p>
In the WCoG the procedure is less involved. (The following is from memory and<br>
is probably incomplete concerning the wording.)<br>
<p>
Minister: "&lt;Full name&gt; have you repented of your sins?"<br>
Person:   "Yes."<br>
Minister: "Do you accept Jesus Christ the as your Lord and Master, your<br>
           High Priest in heaven, and your soon coming King, and have you<br>
           accepted his sacrifice as atonement for your sins?"<br>
Person:   "Yes."<br>
Minister: "As you have done these things, then with the authority invested<br>
           in me as a minister of Jesus Christ, I hereby baptise you into<br>
           the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."<br>
<p>
The person is then totally immersed in the water (sea, river, pool, bathtub!)<br>
wherever they might be. After coming up out of the water, the minister and the<br>
person kneel and the minister lays hands on the person's head and asks God in<br>
prayer to give the gift of the Holy Spirit the the person.<br>
<p>
Leading up to baptism the personal is counselled about the depth of the<br>
committment baptism entails, what keeping the commandments of God means, <br>
and so forth. But no documents are signed and no baptism certificate is<br>
issued.<br>
<p>
Given my background, I am intrigued at the steps involved when an SDA is<br>
baptised.<br>
<p>

<p>
[As I was saying earlier in my post, these vows are not universally <br>
followed anymore, and I was wondering how widespread from the <br>
regular formula the deviations actually are.  SCT]<br>

<p>
I feel the above to be more in line with the Word than how the SDA church <br>
performes baptism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[As I was saying earlier in my post, these vows are not universally </i><br>
<i>&gt;followed anymore, and I was wondering how widespread from the </i><br>
<i>&gt;regular formula the deviations actually are.  SCT]</i><br>
<p>
My wife is an SDA and I have attended SDA churchs for 4 years in two<br>
locations. Both pastors declined to baptise me because I was not a strict<br>
creationest(sp?). I am not a evolutionist, but somewere in between. This<br>
seems to violate one of the 27 rules and they declined to baptise me.<br>
And yes that is the full story.<br>

Hi Steven (&amp; all Other SDANet's)<br>
<p>
First, lets introduce myself. My name is Ademir P. Soares, I am a SDA active<br>
member.<br>
I'd like to get some "Feed-back" from all u people in this above matter. And<br>
I want to use  the same letter to ask your opinion in the following:<br>
<p>
     1) Is the Salvation of Anyone in jeopardy if they chew gum in the church?<br>
        If so why then they never tell people when they get baptized?<br>
<p>
     2) Is this a sign of Disrrespect i.e. irreverence to GOD ? If yes, explain<br>
        to me, please...<br>
<p>
     3) Can an Officer from the Church been rebuken because he/her is chewing<br>
        gum?<br>
<p>
     5) What about if the person/s who did rebuken that Church officer have<br>
        for habit to be (frequently) late for The Sabbath School and from time<br>
        to time bring all their "Vegetariam Arsenal" to be prepared in the<br>
        basement of the church while the sermon is in its way at Church's nave?<br>
<p>
     5) Are there some doctrinal matter that I do NOT know in which we SDA<br>
        should get more involved in this kind of "stupid point" while the<br>
        entire world is fallen apart... while the SDA membership  start to get<br>
        old.... while your youth is quitting or not going to the church at all?<br>
        Are we practicing the "proverbs: DO what I say don't do what I do? or..<br>
        Be reasonable, do things my way???<br>
<p>
     6) My main concern is: IF those people where spending a litle more time<br>
        reading the BIBLE, then they wont have no time to wast in this kind of<br>
        "minor" problem, while the "majors pass by UNOTICIABLE!.<br>
<p>
        Thanks for u all in advance for your attention in this matter.<br>
        Your friend in Jesus,<br>
<p>

The last time I remember baptisimal candidates going through the "27<br>
doctrines" was when I was baptized in 1967, and then it was only 13.  My<br>
observation here in Southeastern California (at least the Anglo churches)<br>
is that most baptisms are *not* accompanied by the candidate(s) publicly<br>
affirming these doctrines.... but then we are accused of strange and<br>
liberal ideas.<br>
I agree with those who find the simpler form more defensable, at least<br>
biblically.  Perhaps the SDA pioneers had it right in the 1860's, that the<br>
first step toward heresy is to "get up a creed."<br>

I think there are better ways to spend our time than to discuss gum chewing<br>
in church.  For me its a personal matter, as long as it doesn't disrupt the<br>
church service for the others (blowing or popping bubbles, noisy chomping,<br>
or other annoying practices).  Let's get on with speading the gospel to the<br>
world.  I believe that as you get into a more and more meaningful experience<br>
with God, the answers for "minor" issues such as this become obvious.<br>

The question "Does chewing gum have anything to do with one's salvation?"<br>
is misplaced at best.  Contained within it is that only matters which have <br>
to do with salvation are important to Christianity, and that if it <br>
doesn't affect one's salvation, then it must be OK.<br>
<p>
Let me remind you that there will most likely be mass murderers, rapists,<br>
forgers, and whatever else in heaven.  We could go so far to say that<br>
even if you do any of these activities, it has nothing to do with your<br>
salvation--all that matters is that if you ask Christ to forgive you and <br>
save you, He will.  But we do not use this rationale to go out and <br>
commit mass murder.<br>
<p>
The question "What's wrong with...?" is always rhetorical and always<br>
expects the answer "Nothing."  Only when veterans of the church answer<br>
that question for people do we get into trouble.<br>
<p>
If we are worried more about God catching us for something we do than<br>
what the actual effect of that action is on ourselves and others, then <br>
we have a problem.  If we envisage God as an enabling co-dependent,<br>
forgiving us so we can go out and sin no more, then we have a problem.<br>
If you are more concerned about God zapping you with a thunderbolt<br>
for chewing gum than you are about the tooth decay it will cause,<br>
I feel sorry for you.<br>

hi, I asked Elder James to find some text for me and I thought it might<br>
help you and others.  So please save this letter and use it whenever<br>
possible.  Please don't change (it's okay if it's positive change) what's<br>
in between ==== sign (except for local contact phone number).   <br>
<p>
 ==================================================================<br>
<p>
Genesis 2:1-3 (KJV)   Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all <br>
the host of them. {2} And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had <br>
made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. <br>
{3} And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he <br>
had rested from all his work which God created and made. <br>
<p>
Exodus 30:12-17 (KJV)   When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel <br>
after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto <br>
the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when <br>
thou numberest them. {13} This they shall give, every one that passeth among <br>
them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a <br>
shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD. <br>
{14} Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years <br>
old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD. {15} The rich shall not <br>
give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give <br>
an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. {16} And<br>
thou <br>
shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it <br>
for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a <br>
memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for <br>
your souls. {17} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <br>
<p>
Exodus 20:3-17 (KJV)   Thou shalt have no other gods before me. {4} Thou shalt <br>
not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in <br>
heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under <br>
the earth: {5} Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I <br>
the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon <br>
the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; <br>
{6} And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my <br>
commandments. {7} Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; <br>
for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. <br>
{8} Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. {9} Six days shalt thou labour, <br>
and do all thy work: {10} But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy <br>
God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, <br>
thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is <br>
within thy gates: {11} For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the <br>
sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD <br>
blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. {12} Honour thy father and thy <br>
mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth <br>
thee. {13} Thou shalt not kill. {14} Thou shalt not commit adultery. {15} Thou <br>
shalt not steal. {16} Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. <br>
{17} Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy <br>
neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his <br>
ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's. <br>
<p>
Ezekiel 20:12 (KJV)   Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign <br>
between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify <br>
them. <br>
<p>
Ezekiel 20:20 (KJV)   And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between <br>
me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God. <br>
<p>
Mark 2:27-28 (KJV)   And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and <br>
not man for the sabbath: {28} Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the <br>
sabbath. <br>
<p>
Isaiah 58:13-14 (KJV)   If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from <br>
doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of <br>
the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor <br>
finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: {14} Then shalt thou <br>
delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high <br>
places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for <br>
the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <br>
<p>
Isaiah 56:2 (KJV)   Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man <br>
that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and <br>
keepeth his hand from doing any evil. <br>
<p>
Luke 4:16 (KJV)   And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, <br>
as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up <br>
for to read. <br>
<p>
Isaiah 66:22-23 (KJV)   For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will <br>
make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name <br>
remain. {23} And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and <br>
from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith <br>
the LORD. <br>
<p>
John 14:15 (KJV)   If ye love me, keep my commandments. <br>
<p>
John 14:21 (KJV)   He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is <br>
that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will <br>
love him, and will manifest myself to him. <br>
<p>
Revelation 22:14 (KJV)   Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they <br>
may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into <br>
the city. <br>

Steve, and SDA Net.<br>
<p>
I could not resist adding a few of my own comments concerning the<br>
independent ministries. I read with interest the various comments as I<br>
paged through the SDA Net.<br>
<p>
We live within driving distance of Hartland Institute and my head elder in<br>
one of the churches that I pastor is the vice chairman on the board of<br>
Hartland. So, I feel that I know pretty much what is going on between<br>
Hartland and Hope International. Through the years some of the Independent<br>
Ministries have had a positive attitude towards things and people.<br>
<p>
I pastored the Laurel Brook Academy in Tennessee and consider the<br>
president, Robt. Zollinger a very good friend of mine. We also were in the<br>
army together for awhile till I shipped out for Korea and he went to<br>
Germany. They are good a good job educating our youth at Academy age.<br>
<p>
My wife and I were also acquainted with the Googe family at Little Creek<br>
Academy also in Tenn. near Knoxville. When I was pastoring in Tenn. Little<br>
Creek had a long waiting list of students that wanted to attend there.<br>
That was during the time when Little Creek was not accredited and Andrews<br>
University would not accept the credits of students going to Andrews from<br>
Little Creek. However, at that time the University of Tennessee in<br>
Knoxville was acquainted with the kind of education graduates of Little<br>
Creek were getting and made the blanket statement that they would accept<br>
any and all students from Little Creek Academy.<br>
<p>
I also have a high regard for Weimar Institute in Calif. They also are<br>
doing a good work. However, some of the other "rank and file" indep.<br>
Ministries is a different story.<br>
<p>
A little bit ago today I was talking to Marten Weber and David Newman at<br>
the General Conf. arranging speaking appts. for them in our churches in<br>
1993; David made this comment, "We have been doing church for 150 years,<br>
it is time that we found something that will change people and that is the<br>
cross!" That too, is my philosophy. This continual criticism of everything<br>
that is done by the denomination is really not accomplishing anything<br>
worth while in my opinion. <br>
<p>
I am sure that some of you at least have read Marten Weber's book on the<br>
"Tortured Conscience." In the book Marten gives some very current<br>
examples of what is going on in Hartland and other such institutions.<br>
<p>
When you have people who have nothing good to say about anything or<br>
anybody and are continuously saying that they are the remnant within the<br>
remnant -- it gets old after awhile. Ralph Larsen who writes in "Firm<br>
Foundation" is a retired minister and has nothing good to ever say about<br>
the denomination that I have ever read. Colin Standish is pretty much in<br>
the same camp. He has always had this "attitude" against the denomination<br>
even when he was teaching and later president of Columbia Union College.<br>
<p>
None of us are absolutely perfect and we will make mistakes but that is no<br>
cause to "scrap" the whole denomination. I receive the "Firm Foundation"<br>
every month and I have been looking for 5 years at least to find one good<br>
thing that the writers say about the denomination and have not found it<br>
yet. Maybe I missed it some place along the line!<br>
<p>
As some of you probably know the GC is publishing a document that will<br>
critique the teachings of Hope International, etc. I am not referring to<br>
the insert in the Adventist Review recently.<br>

Well lets just see, if you had to go to court and were facing a murder<br>
charge would you chew gum to the judges face ? Would this be a sign of <br>
disrespect ?<br>
<p>
How different then is this to standing before the presence of the omnipotent<br>
God and supreme judge of all the earth and chewing gum in His face ?<br>
<p>

Do you mean officially ?<br>
<p>

<p>
As much as we like to say that It doesn't matter what so and so says because<br>
he/she does such and such. That is just an excuse it doesn't matter if the <br>
worst criminal in the world came and told you something was wrong. It's still<br>
your obligation to consider their testimony carefully. Did not God in the <br>
OT sometimes use gentiles to rebuke his own servants ? (Jonah story etc)<br>
<p>
Should God's servants have ignored or rejected to rebuke because they<br>
weren't Israelites ? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      5) Are there some doctrinal matter that I do NOT know in which we SDA</i><br>
<i>&gt;         should get more involved in this kind of "stupid point" while the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         entire world is fallen apart... while the SDA membership  start to get</i><br>
<i>&gt;         old.... while your youth is quitting or not going to the church at all?</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Are we practicing the "proverbs: DO what I say don't do what I do? or..</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Be reasonable, do things my way???</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Well the attitutes reflect the state of consecration and dedication to God.<br>
Instead of attacking the symptoms, why not attempt to cure the disease.<br>
It's not that the superficial things should be excused, but maybe we need to<br>
look a little deeper and longer at ourselves to see if we ourselves are<br>
not "double minded" with respect to the things of God. I think the <br>
consel in James 4:7-10 might be applicable to each of us.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      6) My main concern is: IF those people where spending a litle more time</i><br>
<i>&gt;         reading the BIBLE, then they wont have no time to wast in this kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt;         "minor" problem, while the "majors pass by UNOTICIABLE!.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Yes I would agree but you know that he that is faithful in the little things...<br>
I think it all goes together both the little and the big things, the little<br>
things just show us that something is wrong deep down, the change must be <br>
affected were the wrong is. Giving an asprin to someone with a heat attack<br>
might relieve the pain but I don't think it will do them much good in the long <br>
run.<br>
<p>
Kind Regards<br>
Ruben<br>

Hello Ademir,<br>
	I live in a country where it is illegal to sell chewing gum, they made<br>
that law earlier this year. As such, I suppose we in Singapore will be unlikely<br>
to be faced with the questions you are.<br>
	The salvation of a person is not put in jeopardy by chewing gum per se,<br>
And if you do not chew gum in order to show disrespect for God, I don't think<br>
that God will take offense at it. However, it seems to me that some people in<br>
your church feel that it shows disrespect. I guess it is a matter of culture.<br>
Doing certain things may be acceptable or seen as normal by some people but<br>
for others, these things have other meanings and may be seen as being ill<br>
mannered actions. Eg: some tribes of people feel that it is OK to go around<br>
practically naked, whilst in other cultures, this is socially unacceptable.<br>
	SInce there are some people in your church who feel that it is not<br>
showing respect to God to chew gum in church, I would advice you not to chew<br>
gum during the service. You can always chew it some other time.<br>
	I suggest you read Romans 14, where Paul was talking about such matters<br>
as eating meat (probably because it had been offered to idols, there was a<br>
difference of opinion as to whether it was right for Christians to eat it),<br>
observing festivals and other things. Briefly, what Paul says, i thnk, is that<br>
Christians should not judge people and make a fuss over trivialities and that<br>
if anything upsets other Christians, don't do it, even if you feel it is alright to do so.<br>
	It is true that sometimes in the church, people can get very worked up<br>
over unimportant things and this distracts us from the work and Mission of the <br>
Church and does nothing to improove the spirit of Christian love and unity that<br>
one would expect to find amongst God's people. This problem is a widespread one.Well, i don't know how to deal with it, except that you just have to pray a lot,<br>
be tolerant, and get on with being a Christian and doing God's work. By your<br>
words and actions, show others what Christianity is all about and how Christians<br>
should behave. Above all, we are commanded to love one another and even to love<br>
our enemies, and if we as a church show more of this spirit, there would be<br>
much less arguments, but even if there are, we should not allow this to affect<br>
the carrying out of God's will and work. Just pray and trust God.<br>
	God bless,<br>
		Beng Tang, Singapore.<br>

It's almost frightening to see the vigor with which the gum-chewing<br>
discussion has been carried out.  I was going to post a gum-in-cheek<br>
article about why gum-chewing is a violation against the Lord, only <br>
to have several people present the arguments I was going to use<br>
in all seriousness of argument.  I'm going to post it anyway, just because<br>
we need to learn to laugh at and with ourselves again.  If you are<br>
unable to see humor in the gum discussion, I feel sorry for you.  Since<br>
I'm not<br>
near my library, I can't have as many EGW quotes as originally planned,<br>
but I'll do one better and use unnamed and uncited references to what I know<br>
must be in there somewhere.  Clearly my method of interpretation is faulty,<br>
but I'd like to know where, because it's not all that different from <br>
thoughtlines heard daily on SDAnet.<br>
<p>
So I present:  GUM CHEWING:  A violation against the LORD<br>
<p>
When we consider the early history of chewing gum, we find that one <br>
of the first companies to make it was the Beech-nut company.  Not<br>
coincidentally, this company was and is a large producer of chewing <br>
tobacco.  So we see that from its earliest days, chewing gum was offered<br>
as a substitute for tobacco, but in fact the effect is to make chewing<br>
tobacco seem more acceptable to young people.  This is still illustrated<br>
today by <br>
brands such as "Big League Chew" a gum which has the consistency and<br>
shape of chewing tobacco so that youngsters can emulate the<br>
tobacco-chewing of their <br>
favorite baseball stars.  We can also point to the current marketing <br>
strategy of Wrigley's Spearmint gum as a device to get through periods <br>
when smoking is not prohibited.  So we see the place gum holds in the <br>
modern world today as a tobacco surrogate.<br>
<p>
Anything that promises this much fun must be bad for you, and in truth<br>
it is.  Gum is one of the leading contributors to tooth decay and gum<br>
disease.  It also stimulates addiction by conditioning the chewer to be <br>
constantly in need of oral stimulation.  Nicotine gum is just the last step<br>
in the decadence which starts with the supposedly harmless "sugarless"<br>
gum, and leads from there to ordinary chewing gum, bubble gum, and finally<br>
nicotine gum.  Until now we have not mentioned the choking hazard that gum<br>
poses to small children, or the hazard of self-suffocation by blowing a<br>
bubble which is too big.<br>
<p>
Surely something this dangerous would be banned by God Almighty.  Indeed<br>
it is.  There was no chewing gum in the Bible, but we read the story of<br>
Daniel<br>
praying three times a day, morning, noon, and night.  Since he gave thanks<br>
for all food he received, and he is not recorded as giving thanks any<br>
other time, it follows that he never chewed gum--in fact, never ate<br>
anything between meals.  Ellen G. White says that "not a morsel of food<br>
should pass your lips between meals" and since gum does have calories<br>
this certainly counts as food.  Of course we must remember the texts in<br>
1st Corinthians<br>
which tell us to "glorify God in your body" and "whether therefore ye<br>
eat or drink...do all to the glory of God."<br>
<p>
It has been the traditional Adventist position to ban gum-chewing.  To<br>
this day Adventist academies have strict rules against gum-chewing in<br>
whatever situation, not only in church.  It's well known that P.K.<br>
Wrigley, founder<br>
of Wrigley's, inc. was a devout Catholic.  It's clear that those who would<br>
chew gum anywhere (let alone in church) are engaging in this Jesuit plot<br>
to undercut our health message and our traditional Adventist doctrine.<br>

[If I convinced anybody with this, I am truly scared.  Since I'm in the <br>
People's Republic of Berkeley, political correctness dictates that I <br>
present the opposite view, which I will shortly do.  SCT]<br>

[Again, as Paul said, I speak as a fool-- SCT]<br>
<p>
The SDA church has long been against the right to chew gum in church.<br>
This has exacted a horrible emotional toll on its members who have an<br>
orientation to chew gum.  Insensitive people feel that gum-chewing is a<br>
voluntary act performed for pleasure.  They do not realize that when the<br>
right to gum-chew openly is denied, people go underground (as many in <br>
SDA academies already have) and add shame, danger, and extra cost to the<br>
process which should be their right to perform.<br>
<p>
Some so-called progressives call gum-chewing a disease and say that its<br>
chewers should be treated with compassion, and maybe they will come to<br>
recovery.  We gum-chewers see no need to "recover" from a lifestyle that<br>
we enjoy and believe is perfectly normal.  To stop chewing gum in church<br>
or anywhere else would be an essential denial of who we are.  There have<br>
been posts on this net that say people should be sensitive to those who<br>
chew gum out of necessity.  This only serves to deepen the unwarranted<br>
distinction between the "worthy" gum chewers and the "unworthy" gum<br>
chewers.  To condemn gum because some gum-chewers also chew tobacco is a<br>
tired expression of guilt-by-association.<br>
<p>
We demand a new curriculum in the SDA schools which celebrates all<br>
diversity including that of gum-chewers, and promotes gum-chewing as a<br>
healthy lifestyle.  We encourage "safe chewing" by promoting sugarless<br>
gum.  We demand that gum-chewers no longer be ejected from church.  And<br>
we invite you<br>
to our special gum-chewing party at the gum-chewers camp meeting next summer.<br>
For more requests write to GUMSHOE, Berkeley, CA.<br>

Steven Timm writes about Independent ministries:<br>
<p>
Are all non-independent ministries that good for that<br>
matter? Did Jesus ban independent ministries?<br>
============================================<br>
I LOVE your question!<br>
<p>
Jesus not only refrained from banning independent ministries,<br>
<p>
**************Jesus WAS an independent ministry.******************<br>
<p>
Independent of the organized and official Jewish teachers, but very<br>
dependent on our heavenly Father.  Thank God for even the opportunity<br>
to say that, "our heavenly Father")<br>
<p>
However, since we're in a 'body" (or trying to be), the body of Christ,<br>
our ministries should be for building UP the body, not breaking it DOWN.<br>

Hello,<br>
     About the recent wave of discussion about independent<br>
ministries. I don't think it right to stereotype them all and<br>
<p>
brand them as a nuisance. Surely not all of them are trouble-<br>
makers. Are all non-independent ministries that good for that<br>
matter? Did Jesus ban independent ministries?<br>
<p>
Mark 9:38-41 38 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one<br>
casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we<br>
forbad him, because he followeth not us. 39 But Jesus said,<br>
Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in<br>
my name, that can lightly speak evil of me. 40 For he that is not<br>
against us is on our part. 41 For whosoever shall give you a cup<br>
of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily<br>
I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Sure, some of them are pretty far out, but aren't there some<br>
which are doing a good service and spreading the Gospel? Are we<br>
not all called to our own ministries as Christians to a dying<br>
world? Is SDAnet an independent ministry?<br>
     Just thoughts, no offence meant to anyone.<br>
     Regards,<br>
               Beng Tang.<br>
<br>
[Indeed SDAnet is an independent ministry, although one that needs and <br>
solicits no funds.  So I don't expect any trouble from the ministry police<br>
anytime soon.  SCT]<br>

Amen Cheryl!<br>
<p>
I think someone _did_ say that it might have been better for us to have <br>
a stone<br>
placed around our necks, and tossed into the Tennessee River, Lake Michigan,<br>
or Pacific Ocean (Note: I'm trying to "relocate" the text near SDA <br>
"ghettos."), for<br>
offending any of these "little ones."<br>
<p>
"Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look _full_ in His wonderful face, and the things<br>
of earth (self-righteousness, fault finding, jealousy...) will grow <br>
*strangely* dim,<br>
in the light of his glory and grace."  [emphasis supplied]<br>
<p>
M(your humble servant)S<br>

Just to offer another view of this issue.  Perhaps there is reason a person<br>
might chew gum in church (or anywhere else for that matter) which is of<br>
therapeutic or comfort value.  For example, people who are trying to quit<br>
smoking frequently chew gum to deal with the nicotine urge.  Would it be<br>
wrong or showing disrespect for such a person to chew gum so that he/she<br>
can sit through a worship service more comfortable?  No.  In fact, I think<br>
it tunnel vision for anyone to assume that chewing gum is WRONG even if it<br>
affends others because there may be a very logical and legitimate reason<br>
that person is chewing gum.  Another example:  there are many medications<br>
that people might have to take that makes their mouths intolerably dry or<br>
leaves a bad taste in the person's mouth.  The antibiotic I'm taking right<br>
now leaves a bad metallic taste in my mouth.  Rather than suffer with this,<br>
the obvious thing to do is to chew gum or suck a lifesaver candy.<br>
<p>
As soon church members start pointing fingers, rebuking people for doing<br>
things that they themselves wouldn't do (whether there's a good reason or<br>
not), they are judging others.  There is absolutely no justification for<br>
making these kinds of trivial judgments.  It doesn't enhance spiritual<br>
growth and may even offend so that those being offended leave the church.<br>

Hello,<br>
<p>
I know, it's been a while, but I think I have something.<br>
<p>
During our last church board meeting the pastor brought up the issue of<br>
indie ministries. He had a copy of "Issues", that paper cannon (or canon?)<br>
ball meant as a broadside to accusations made by certain ministries within<br>
the church. Most, if not all of the members present, seemed supportive of<br>
the GC in its response, a loving yet firm rebuttal. According to readers<br>
of the document, only about 1/3 of the document is actual verbage by the<br>
authors; the rest is footnotes and references to documents published by the<br>
ministries in question. <br>
<p>
Personally, I don't have the time right now to read it from cover-to-cover<br>
(I have a take-home final to take care of before Wednesday), but I would<br>
have to ask one major question: did the authors do a good job of researching<br>
their material or did they quote out of context to prove their point?<br>
We'll see what a rise out of the general congregation this will provide,<br>
though it seems that there were more important questions at the moment.<br>
<p>
One of the members reported of one member who has been publicly blasting<br>
the church. She suggested that we recommend that that member be removed<br>
from the rolls. Another member spoke, "If we did that to every member who<br>
puts down the church, we wouldn't have many church members left."<br>

Was I dreaming?  I thought Adenir's piece on chewing gum was to show us how<br>
silly it is to spend time worrying about chewing gum in church rather than<br>
getting on with the business of the church.  Am I wrong?  Or are we too<br>
busy discussing chewing gum ourselves....???<br>

The discussion on baptism is bringing out the point I had hoped it would,<br>
namely this.<br>
<p>
All sins are equal in the eyes of God, but not necessarily in the<br>
eyes of the church.<br>
<p>
God says:  "Don't sin"<br>
<p>
The church says "Don't get caught."<br>
<p>
Thus those things which SDA lifestyle terms "sin" and must be foregone<br>
before baptism are those of a nature where it is a continuing and<br>
visible mark of not being in harmony with the standards of the church.<br>
<p>
Now, believe it or not, there is actually Biblical justification for this<br>
type of view.  Does anyone know where it is?  (Hint, somewhere in <br>
1 Corinthians).<br>

I continue to be amazed at what some of our dear ministers and members<br>
believe is necessary in order to be baptized!  Somewhere along the way<br>
we've drifted from the biblical baptism into Christ based solely on<br>
your belief in Him and His saving grace -- now we have baptism into<br>
the church, based on your acceptance of a variety of doctrines and<br>
minutia that may have nothing to do with saving grace at all.<br>
<p>
I was baptized in the 60' (way before the 27 fundamental beliefs) and<br>
if I were to go up for rebaptism today I'm afraid I would be rejected<br>
as unsuitable!  Yet I have been and am an active member for all those<br>
years.  Here in our little church we had a man who wished for baptism<br>
after attending a series of meetings and for some unknown reason the<br>
pastor put him off, saying we have no baptismal tank in our church<br>
and so he should wait (makes no sense -- we're surrounded by other<br>
churches that have tanks, like the Baptists).  This man was so<br>
convicted that he went down to the local lake and baptized himself!<br>
I'll admit, that shows perhaps a bit of a misunderstanding of the<br>
whole baptism issue, but the strength of his conviction is what<br>
impressed me.  And the conviction was strong enough that he stuck it<br>
out and kept coming to church and was finally "officially" baptized<br>
about 6 months later at another series of meetings that had a portable<br>
tank.  At his official baptism, some dear old brother came up to this<br>
man's lady friend (who had been attending wi"th him regularly) and told<br>
her that if she didn't get baptized she would never be able to marry<br>
her friend!  Needless to say she was insulted, but she has stuck<br>
it out also and continues to attend, perhaps because the brother who<br>
insulted her attends church in another town.  Sometimes I wonder why<br>
God doesn't just skip us people and depend on the rocks crying out....<br>

Just to offer another view of this issue.  Perhaps there is reason a person<br>
might chew gum in church (or anywhere else for that matter) which is of<br>
therapeutic or comfort value.  For example, people who are trying to quit<br>
smoking frequently chew gum to deal with the nicotine urge.  Would it be<br>
wrong or showing disrespect for such a person to chew gum so that he/she<br>
can sit through a worship service more comfortable?  No.  In fact, I think<br>
it tunnel vision for anyone to assume that chewing gum is WRONG even if it<br>
affends others because there may be a very logical and legitimate reason<br>
that person is chewing gum.  Another example:  there are many medications<br>
that people might have to take that makes their mouths intolerably dry or<br>
leaves a bad taste in the person's mouth.  The antibiotic I'm taking right<br>
now leaves a bad metallic taste in my mouth.  Rather than suffer with this,<br>
the obvious thing to do is to chew gum or suck a lifesaver candy.<br>
<p>
As soon church members start pointing fingers, rebuking people for doing<br>
things that they themselves wouldn't do (whether there's a good reason or<br>
not), they are judging others.  There is absolutely no justification for<br>
making these kinds of trivial judgments.  It doesn't enhance spiritual<br>
growth and may even offend so that those being offended leave the church.<br>

Hello Ademir,<br>
	I live in a country where it is illegal to sell chewing gum, they made<br>
that law earlier this year. As such, I suppose we in Singapore will be unlikely<br>
to be faced with the questions you are.<br>
	The salvation of a person is not put in jeopardy by chewing gum per se,<br>
And if you do not chew gum in order to show disrespect for God, I don't think<br>
that God will take offense at it. However, it seems to me that some people in<br>
your church feel that it shows disrespect. I guess it is a matter of culture.<br>
Doing certain things may be acceptable or seen as normal by some people but<br>
for others, these things have other meanings and may be seen as being ill<br>
mannered actions. Eg: some tribes of people feel that it is OK to go around<br>
practically naked, whilst in other cultures, this is socially unacceptable.<br>
	SInce there are some people in your church who feel that it is not<br>
showing respect to God to chew gum in church, I would advice you not to chew<br>
gum during the service. You can always chew it some other time.<br>
	I suggest you read Romans 14, where Paul was talking about such matters<br>
as eating meat (probably because it had been offered to idols, there was a<br>
difference of opinion as to whether it was right for Christians to eat it),<br>
observing festivals and other things. Briefly, what Paul says, i thnk, is that<br>
Christians should not judge people and make a fuss over trivialities and that<br>
if anything upsets other Christians, don't do it, even if you feel it is alright to do so.<br>
	It is true that sometimes in the church, people can get very worked up<br>
over unimportant things and this distracts us from the work and Mission of the <br>
Church and does nothing to improove the spirit of Christian love and unity that<br>
one would expect to find amongst God's people. This problem is a widespread one.Well, i don't know how to deal with it, except that you just have to pray a lot,<br>
be tolerant, and get on with being a Christian and doing God's work. By your<br>
words and actions, show others what Christianity is all about and how Christians<br>
should behave. Above all, we are commanded to love one another and even to love<br>
our enemies, and if we as a church show more of this spirit, there would be<br>
much less arguments, but even if there are, we should not allow this to affect<br>
the carrying out of God's will and work. Just pray and trust God.<br>
	God bless,<br>
		Beng Tang, Singapore.<br>

Well I am glad for you. Praise God!<br>
	I live in a country which works a 6 and a half day week (Monday to<br>
noon on Sabbath) so Sabbath problems are not new to me either. I have<br>
frequently had to see teachers and heads of department about tests or<br>
exams on Sabbath. Thankfully, they have always so far let me take it on a<br>
different day. Now in the university, I miss 4 hours of lectures every week<br>
because they are on Sabbath, but have so far not had a test fall on Sabbath.<br>
I know of people who have failed exams because they didn't go for them when<br>
they fell on Sabbath. <br>
	Earlier this year, when I was still in the army, my Officer Commanding<br>
threatened to have me court-marshalled for insubordination when I would not<br>
do a physical fitness test on Sabbath. That had me really worried, but, and<br>
I thank God for this, he finally arranged for me to take the test on another<br>
date.<br>
	We may have trying times sometimes, on account of our beliefs, but<br>
I'm sure I for one, have not so far faced the trials others have had to.<br>
There are tales of Christians being killed because of their faith, the<br>
3 Hebrews in Babylonian exile went through the fiery furnace, and millions<br>
were murdered during the dark ages. Even today in some countries, Christians<br>
face death if they profess their beliefs. Furthermore, prophecy says that<br>
more trying times are ahead, a time of trouble such as never was since there<br>
was a nation, so I guess our little trials might in some way, prepare us<br>
for what lies ahead. One good thing aout problems is that it reminds you how<br>
much you need God and it strengthens your faith.<br>
	Well, once again, I'll say I am really happy that you got to take your<br>
test on Friday instead. May God bless you.<br>
						Beng Tang, Singapore.<br>

Here in Finland we do not generally have Sabbathproblems, but the devil is workin<br>
in more subtle ways. In Finland there is not free Saturdays but a five day<br>
week. That means that if there is a public holiday in the middle of the <br>
week, then you have to work that day in on Saturday, this will happen a couple<br>
times a year. When you are baptised then the problem with the sabbath is very <br>
far a way, and you do not want to embarass yourself and your boss with<br>
this matter. So when this Sabbbath comes, you are missing many of our<br>
"younger in spirit" member in the church.<br>
<p>
generally there are no schools on Saturdays, but now the government has<br>
decided that the spring feast at the end of the school year is always on saturday [K<br>
also the Christmas feast are quite often on saturdays.  And so it is not<br>
really school, so why not be there in stead for making big fuss...<br>
<p>
<p>
I think these Sabath problems are much bigger than when I had to<br>
make a decision here and now.<br>

Hi as I was reading Matthew 25: 1 - 13, I was wondering what those virgins<br>
represents.  Are they Bride or bridemaid.  I was thinking that it mush be<br>
bride.  But if it were bride why her bridegroom wouldn't let them in<br>
because they didn't have oil?  I want someone to answer that.<br>
God Bless everyone.<br>

I have tried this before and it has not worked.  Lets see if it works<br>
now.<br>
<p>
All sin is the same in the eyes of God.  This includes going sixty in a<br>
fifty-five mph area. <br>
<p>
What I get a kick out of are the churchs ban on the selling of tobacco<br>
but not on the selling of pork.<br>
<p>
I would like to say more, but want to see if this gets through first.<br>

<i>&gt;I have tried this before and it has not worked.  Lets see if it works</i><br>
<i>&gt;now.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;All sin is the same in the eyes of God.  This includes going sixty in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;fifty-five mph area.</i><br>
 <br>
I've alway's understood 'sin' to be 'transgression of the law', God's Law.<br>
This statement seems to equate speed limits on the same level as the<br>
Ten Commandments.  Speed limits are most often reasonable, and argueably<br>
should be respected,  but I wouldn't call breaking them 'a sin'.  If a<br>
government law requires Sabbath-breaking, it wouldn't be 'a sin' to disregard<br>
that law would it ?  The point is that not all of man's laws are God's and<br>
in a secular society, vis-versa.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What I get a kick out of are the churchs ban on the selling of tobacco</i><br>
<i>&gt;but not on the selling of pork.</i><br>
<p>
Pork at least has some nutritional value, where the same can't be said for<br>
tobacco.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would like to say more, but want to see if this gets through first.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

------------<br>
<p>
Steve, you say this as if it were axiomatic.  I don't think it<br>
is.  There are many accounts within the Bible that indicate<br>
that God judges sin for the particular sin that it is, not just<br>
the fact that it is a sin.  Proverbs singles out many sins for<br>
specific condemnation.<br>

About the magnitude of sins:<br>
----------------------------<br>
    "God does not regard all sins as of equal magnitude; there<br>
are degrees of guilt in His estimation, as well as in that of<br>
man; but however trifling this or that wrong act may seem in the<br>
eyes of men, no sin is small in the sight of God. Man's judgment<br>
is partial, imperfect; but God estimates all things as they<br>
really are. The drunkard is despised and is told that his sin<br>
will exclude him from heaven; while pride, selfishness, and<br>
covetousness too often go unrebuked. But these are sins that are<br>
especially offensive to God; for they are contrary to the<br>
benevolence of His character, to that unselfish love which is the<br>
very atmosphere of the unfallen universe. He who falls into some<br>
of the grosser sins may feel a sense of his shame and poverty and<br>
his need of the grace of Christ; but pride feels no need, and so<br>
it closes the heart against Christ and the infinite blessings He<br>
came to give."    (from "Steps to Christ", by E. G. White)<br>

On last night, the final night of my stay in Berkeley, I attended a <br>
public lecture by Stephen Hawking, the British cosmologist of _Brief <br>
History Of Time_ fame.  In his public lectures and books he is very <br>
simple, straightforward, and accessible, partly because his computer<br>
voice system forces him to be.  (As a result I didn't personally learn<br>
anything I didn't already know.)  <br>
<p>
He was talking about "The Future Of The Universe", and used as an<br>
introduction some examples about predictions in general and the end of<br>
the world in specific.  He used the example of William Miller, whom <br>
he incorrectly labeled as the founder of the SDA church.  But he then <br>
correctly gave the reason that Seventh-day Adventists (and not Miller)<br>
used when Oct. 22, 1844 did not result in the coming of Christ.  Namely<br>
that we say that God is judging all those whose names are in the book <br>
of life.<br>
<p>
He then compared his own prediction of the end of the universe in ten billion<br>
years or so, and noted that he had the advantage that he would not be around<br>
to be scorned if it were found to be wrong.<br>

<p>
It is my feeling that the financial difficulties of the Church come not just<br>
as a curse, but also as a blessing in disguise. Due to shortness of funds,<br>
the church in many areas is having to reexamine its priorities, and <br>
restructure its activities. Some really good things are resulting. (It almost<br>
makes me wonder whether people should have got together and deprived the<br>
Church of money a while back!!)(Well...maybe not!)<br>
<p>
It is hearing of this new-found flexibility (which I hope will spread) that<br>
encourages me about the church. It doesn't *have* to be stuck in a rut.<br>

It was remarked by someone on this net (not me) that one of the first<br>
hallmarks of a self-absorbed church is long and protracted calls for the<br>
offering.  Lately it has become a sport in my church to wax long and<br>
eloquent, each elder in turn trying to outdo the other in finding a new<br>
twist to put on the offering call.  <br>
<p>
When hearing the long description the past Sabbath about why our church<br>
really needs a renovated office to the tune of $8000, it reminded me of<br>
a fundraising pitch on public radio  (Give today, or give next week, or <br>
pay in installments, or...) I almost expected that "Dial 621-6900" would<br>
be next.  I don't respond to public radio fundraisers even when they're<br>
on <br>
public radio--why must I be assaulted with one in my own church?<br>
<p>
[Editor's note:  we plan to give one of the offertory callers equal time<br>
if he so desires.  No personal attack is intended.  SCT]<br>
<p>
For fairness, I should also note that these extended offering calls are<br>
effective and giving is quite on the rise in our local church.<br>
<p>
The long offering call is only part of several long segments of talk in<br>
the worship service.  I measured 24 minutes of talk in the 75 minute<br>
service,<br>
not including the sermon, in a different week.  Most of this talk is not<br>
readings or worship-related.  This represent times when the audience is<br>
sitting and not participating in the worship service.  I think we can do<br>
better.<br>

Raylene made the comment that perhaps financial difficulty is good for the <br>
church sometimes because it forces innovation to occor which would not<br>
otherwise occur.  The present system of "departments" in the church<br>
organization was started because of necessity in the fields of South<br>
Africa<br>
and Australia in the late 1890's, and then was adopted by the whole church.<br>
<p>
But I do not agree that the church is currently in financial difficulty.<br>
The financial report as summarized in the Adventist Review indicates that<br>
fiscal 1992 was a good year for the church with record amounts of tithe<br>
and an operating surplus.  It makes me wonder if all this worry about <br>
"independent ministries" is just crying "Wolf!" when no wolf is around.<br>

After the last couple "Bah, Humbug" messages I sent out, I would like <br>
to send the greetings for the season.  Though I am sometimes critical or<br>
sarcastic, I cannot be pessimistic when I see the glow in the eyes of a<br>
child who is hearing the Christmas story for the first time.  We can be<br>
assured that our future is as bright as we are willing to let God make<br>
it.<br>
<p>
As Joseph and Mary were homeless in Bible times, so "Joe" of recent net<br>
conversation is homeless today, sleeping in an abandoned building without<br>
heat, light, or water.  Until he realizes that he holds the keys to his<br>
own destiny and the Lord helps him take control of his life, he'll<br>
probably stay that way.  Fortunately nobody at Shadyside had the gall to<br>
kick him out of the church during the Christmas season.  He gave this<br>
greeting to me, and I <br>
pass it on as his wish and mine  "God bless us, every one."<br>
<p>
Merry Christmas and thanks for all your support.  The next SDAnet messages<br>
will come on Jan. 1.<br>
<p>

25 minute offering calls ? !!!<br>
I wonder if people would feel like giving more if the offering call was shortened or done away with. It sounds like a pity if the memberss are willing to<br>
give only after a 25 minute appeal. I thought that the offering during the<br>
service was supposed to be an act of worship. We should follow the example<br>
of the poor widdow who gave her meagre mite to the temple without the priests,<br>
pharisees or whoever, having to make extenuated pleas for offerings.<br>

Steve, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The question "Does chewing gum have anything to do with one's salvation?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;is misplaced at best.  Contained within it is that only matters which have </i><br>
<i>&gt;to do with salvation are important to Christianity, and that if it </i><br>
<i>&gt;doesn't affect one's salvation, then it must be OK...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The question "What's wrong with...?" is always rhetorical and always</i><br>
<i>&gt;expects the answer "Nothing."  Only when veterans of the church answer</i><br>
<i>&gt;that question for people do we get into trouble.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If we are worried more about God catching us for something we do than</i><br>
<i>&gt;what the actual effect of that action is on ourselves and others, then </i><br>
<i>&gt;we have a problem...</i><br>
<p>
When we are children, we quickly learn the question "What's wrong with...?"<br>
  "What's wrong with playing that game on Sabbath mum?"<br>
  "What's wrong with eating between meals anyway?"<br>
Some of these answers are obviously more easy to explain than others. The<br>
reality of the situation, however, is that we learned to ask the wrong<br>
question.<br>
<p>
There are a lot of things in life that aren't especially *wrong* but that<br>
don't benefit ourselves or anyone else - they aren't especially *right*.<br>
What I suggest is that the question we should be asking is "What's RIGHT<br>
with ...?" When asking that question, a whole range of better alternatives<br>
present themselves and it becomes more likely that one would follow the<br>
spirit of the law rather than the letter of it.<br>
<p>
Raylene<br>
---*---<br>
<p>
ps. A happy Christmas and New Year to all SDAnetters!<br>

re. "independent ministries"  The G.C. has come down very hard on some<br>
of these lately.  INMHO it is SOLELY because they have accepted, and are<br>
soliciting tithe money.  I firmly believe that a person should be able<br>
to chose where his tithe money is used.  Personally, mine goes through<br>
normal church channels, though after reading the scathing reveiw article,<br>
and reading the official statement, I am sorely tempted to send a note<br>
to the G.C. telling them that I am withdrawing my tithe from normal church<br>
channels, and directing it toward the "independent ministries" because of<br>
thier attitude.  Personally, I enjoy reading Our Firm Foundation.  I don't<br>
think that the church as apostitized.  I don't agree with the brethern that<br>
the independent ministries call anything that they don't agree with apostacy.<br>
<p>
Most of the points held by the "independent ministries" have bee espoused at<br>
one time or other by the Adventist Church.  We have studiouly avoided adopting<br>
a creed, on Mrs. Whites council, and I think it should stay that way.  I see<br>
the churches paper and stance as a move toward establishing such a creed.<br>
(i.e.  If you aren't a loyal tither, who sends his tithe through church<br>
channels, then you can't be a Seventh-day Adventist.)<br>

In my recent travels in San Francisco, I was looking for a Seventh-day<br>
Adventist church in the San Francisco phone book.  I found only several<br>
congregations at which it was clear foreign tongues would be spoken.<br>
If I had not remembered a feature I had seen some time back, I wouldn't<br>
have thought to look under "Central" and thus successfully find the<br>
"Central Seventh-day Adventist Church", listed under "Central" in the<br>
phone book.  <br>
<p>
In Pittsburgh the Shadyside church is listed under "Seventh-day Adventist<br>
church in pages both white and yellow, this leads to us getting many of the <br>
visitors which come through town.  Is your church locatable in the phone<br>
book?  What about the hotel church directories?<br>
<p>
Just a thought.<br>

Ruben I fear you are not giving a balanced view of EGW. Ellen also like<br>
we should, progressed in her christian experience. We many times credit<br>
Waggoner and Jones with giving us the message of Righteousness by Faith<br>
to the Advent believers in 1888. This is true but it was Ellen that<br>
"picked up the ball" of Righteousness By Faith and ran with it. <br>
<p>
Previously she had held the 10 commandments as the primary thing after<br>
1888 the cross of Christ and him crucified was primary and the<br>
commandments were a side issue. There are 2 paintings one depicts her<br>
views in the beginning -- 1800s -- where the 10 commandments were<br>
center stage. After she learned about Righteousness by Faith the<br>
painting was changed to reflect her thinking -- and a picture of Christ<br>
on the cross was center stage and the commandments were I believe in<br>
the left side and much smaller in size. All this communicated her new<br>
thinking of salvation. I believe I can get a copy of the pictures for<br>
you.<br>
<p>
For instance here is one quote from EGW:<br>
<p>
"We must seek to redeem the neglect of the past. We must come up from<br>
the lowlands of earth. We must not preach any more Christless sermons, <br>
or any long Christless lives." RH, July 16, 1889.<br>
<p>
Adventism was cold and formal because its laity was bombarded with<br>
"Christless sermons" that had guided the ministerial perspective.<br>
<p>
EGW again: "We may commit the keeping our souls to God as unto a<br>
faithful creator, not because we are SINLESS, but because Jesus died to<br>
save just such erring, faulty creatures as we ARE, thus expressing his<br>
estimatre of the value of the human soul. We may rest upon God, not<br>
because of our own merit, but because the righteousness of Christ will<br>
be imputed to us. We must look away from self to the spotless Lamb of<br>
God, who did no sin; and by looking to Him in living faith, we shall<br>
become like him." --"Effectual Prayer" Nov. 10,  Remarks to Ministers<br>
at 1883 General Conference.<br>
<p>
EGW: "Righteousness is obedience to the law. The law demands<br>
righteousness, and this the SINNER owes to the law; BUT HE IS INCAPABLE<br>
OF REMDERING IT. The only way in which he can attain to righteousness<br>
is through faith. By faith he can bring to God the merits of Christ, <br>
and the Lord places the obedience of His son to the sinner's account. <br>
Christ's rightewouness is accepted in place of man's failure, and God<br>
receives, pardons, justifies, the repentant believing soul, treats him<br>
as though he were rightwous and loves him as He loves His son. This is<br>
how faith is accounted righteousness."  EGW RH, Nov. 4, 1890<br>
<p>
Ellen White fully understood Justification. In 1889 Mrs. White drew<br>
from the illustration of jacob's ladder to illustrate the relationship<br>
between justification and sanctification. She told the beleivers at the<br>
Chicago campmeeting that Christ "IS YOUR PERFECTION." She went on to<br>
say that we could not "scale the battlements of heaven were it not for<br>
the fact that Christ is the ladder." Without Christ as the ladder or<br>
mediator, to continually make our efforts acceptable, we would be<br>
unable to ascend one inch toward heaven, through our most sanctified<br>
efforts. This is what she said:<br>
<p>
"While you appreciate the love of God, you will have living faith. You<br>
must climb up by Christ; he is the ladder. We could not scale the<br>
battlements of heaven were it not for th fact that Christ is the<br>
ladder. The base of the ladder rests upon the earth, and the top<br>
reaches into the higest heavens. The base of this divine ladder touches<br>
the earth. If it had stopped one inch sort of that, humanity could have<br>
never reached the first round; but it is the goodness of God that<br>
leadeth you to repentance, and the grace and mercy of God shines down <br>
on every round, for God is above the ladder. It's topmost round reaches<br>
into the heaven of heavens. The light of God's love brightens the whole<br>
length of the ladder, and every step upward is a step toward Him." <br>
--"Christ's Burden Is Light" sermon at Chicago April 6, 1889<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
<p>
	I would like to strongly recommend that people who email private<br>
replies regarding questions being discussed publically on SDAnet<br>
do not necessarily wish to be responded to via public posts.<br>
<p>
	I think that this is a matter of ethics. I believe<br>
(and I think Steve would agree with me) that SDAnet is not for personal<br>
reply neither for observations regarding one's person. Rather for<br>
public discussion of matters of public interest.<br>
<p>
Ruben.<br>
	<br>
[I certainly do agree with Ruben.  If I have been guilty of such,<br>
I apologize in advance, but please bring to my attention.  SCT]<br>

----------------------<br>
A statement from Ruben Gonzalez<br>
<p>
	Upon consideration of the direction of this discussion with Paul<br>
regarding perfection and the nature of personal remarks<br>
which I find are unjustified, I publically announce my withdrawl from<br>
any further discussion of this topic in public on this net for the present<br>
time. I will be happy to continue the discussion personally via private email<br>
with any interested parties.<br>
<p>
Hoping in this way not to give any offensive to any nor to be a stumbling<br>
block to any, nor wishing to violate the charter of this Net.<br>
I believe what I have already posted on this matter being <br>
enough evidence of my position.<br>
<p>
I believe withdrawing is the best policy, and can not see further<br>
benefit in continuing. I do this in all sincerety and in full confidence<br>
in the position I have presented before you regarding the matter in question.<br>
<p>
However since some have gotten the incorrect idea that I make sinlessness<br>
a prerequisite for salvation. I would state that this is something I have <br>
niether said nor implied. This opinion is founded purely upon the forceful<br>
nature of EGW's statements who not only tells us of the possibility<br>
but the importance of attaining. I know that I am the furthest from attaining<br>
however I trust in the Lord who is mighty to save. I let you all judge<br>
for yourselves the truth based on the texts I have previously provided.<br>
<p>
I would further say that I have never intentially taken any scripture<br>
nor statement from EGW out of context. I believe they speak quite<br>
well for themselves and do not need my assistance. Sometimes however<br>
these statments need to be brought out into the open for people to see<br>
and evaluate for themselves.<br>
<p>
If in any way I have been uncourtious or demonstated an unchristian attitude<br>
to any involved in this discussion I submit my most humble apology. <br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Ruben.<br>
<p>
[I thank Ruben for this graciousness.  When debates start getting personal<br>
it's hard to know where to cut them off.  This marks only the fourth or <br>
fifth post I have rejected in the history of SDAnet.  It follows<br>
that any arguments of that nature from the other side will be cut.<br>
When any discussion on perfection resumes, I want the inspired writings<br>
to be used neither as a means of attack nor as a target of attack.<br>
SDAnet is not in place to foster old-style doctrinal debates which have <br>
plagued Adventism for years.  We are here to foster real communication<br>
and understanding.  Some of that happened in the perfection thread, <br>
unfortunately not enough.  If your  post begins with the name of some<br>
person, it should probably be addressed to that person privately, and<br>
if you don't know how to do that, I can tell you.  SCT]<br>

  Just received my gift subscription to Signs.  My wife's, sister's,<br>
husband's mother sent it to us (for some reason she had the card telling<br>
us it was coming say that it was from the sister-in-law?).<br>
<p>
  I see that this is published by the SDA church, so it is an official<br>
type of thing, right?  If it is in one of the articles then most of the<br>
mainstream SDA believe that?<br>
<p>
  More on my impressions of the magazine later.<br>

Hope you enjoy it.  If others are interested, I can post a subscription<br>

Hi networkers,<br>
 <br>
I'm just wondering if anyone is interested in just helping out with the<br>
network a bit.  All that is involved is to keep track of people on the<br>
list, try to encourage people to use the list and try to get some good<br>
postings to the list, and help out in any problems that people seem to<br>
have.  I will be moving at the end of May and I don't think I'll be able<br>
to get networking access wherever I end up.  As I don't usually handle<br>
the problems but rather divert them to my brother, whoever wishes to<br>
take on the job may or may not be involved with the problems.<br>
 <br>
Thanks for your response,<br>
 <br>
Christine<br>

Then there are the dozens that are no longer on the list that did<br>
appear on the list....  I guess that's why it's an update--to get you<br>
all to write?!<br>

To Steve &amp;/or SDAnet<br>
<p>
I recently received a copy of an article that appeared in "Adventists<br>
Affirm", Spring 1991.  Titled "How Adventists Can Stop Growing", by<br>
Dean M. Kelley, Exec director for Religious Liberty National Council of<br>
Churches; the author of "Why Conservative Churches Are Growing.  The<br>
article had originally printed in "Ministry", Feb 1982.<br>
<p>
I could:<br>
<p>
  * Type it up for SDAnet.<br>
<p>
  * Type it up with lots of . . . . . . . to shorten it up, but retain<br>
    pretty much the message and words of the author.<br>
<p>
  * Resort to saying much of it in my own words, quoting here and there.<br>
<p>
Do you have a problem with entirely, or mostly quoting an article such<br>
as this?  In other words, what copy right rules apply?  Would something<br>
'copied' to SDAnet be construed as "publishing"?  Is SDAnet considered<br>
a publication?  I don't think so.<br>
<p>
Perhaps this was something already discussed on SDAnet when it came out?<br>
If its ancient history on this newsgroup then I'll not bring it back to<br>
the table.<br>
<p>
Dave (David E. Buxton)<br>
[As far as copyright laws are concerned, I think it technically is illegal<br>
to transmit a whole article across the net without the author's permission.<br>
But we have done this several times before, and I leave this to the <br>
discretion of the individual poster.  If you wish to avoid the appearance <br>
of evil, summarize the article.  I think it would be a good thing to discuss,<br>
we certainly have not discussed such an article here before.  SCT]<br>

<p>
<i>&gt;You have found quite a collection to "prove" that perfection (cease to</i><br>
<i>&gt;sin) is not only possible but perhaps even "required".  This theory is</i><br>
<i>&gt;probably sound. </i><br>
<p>
Well my intention was not to "prove" anything other than to<br>
indicate EGW's position on the perfection question, considering<br>
Paul indication that she taught the opposite. When I "prove" any doctrine<br>
I do so purely from the bible which also teaches the same.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But we don't have a single instance in humanity where</i><br>
<i>&gt;perfection was ever attained.  Jesus may be an example.  However, he</i><br>
<i>&gt;never sinned PERIOD, so how could he cease to sin. </i><br>
<p>
The bible clearly sets before us 3 people whom it says attined perfection,<br>
Noah, Job and Daniel by association (in Eze). Further more we are<br>
told of 2 who were translated to heaven without seeing death<br>
Enoch and Elijah (EGW tells us they had attained it). Now the wages<br>
of sin is death so that if they did not die it is because they had<br>
overcome all sin.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;None the great</i><br>
<i>&gt;apostles and NT Bible writers claimed to have reached perfection.  Even</i><br>
<i>&gt;EGW herself never claimed such.  </i><br>
<p>
EGW teaches us that those who are closest to attaining, will consider <br>
themselves the most unworthy and the furthest from attaining. Because<br>
they will see God's own absolute perfection in clearer light and realise<br>
how far away they are from God's absolute perfection. So that the person who<br>
truely is perfect will never consider themselves to be thus and if they<br>
do it is because they have not attained anything but self-righteousness. <br>
So what we have here is a hypothetical<br>
possibility but extremely improbable.  Particularly if those who seemed<br>
to live on a higher spiritual plane than most could not attain it.  So,<br>
it is essentially a moot point.  Whether or not perfection is attained<br>
does not seemed to be the acid test of whether we are saved.  So why<br>
worry about?  I think that the day I start feeling like I've attained<br>
perfection, I'm in serious trouble with self-righteous pride.<br>
<p>
"He he has the most knowledge, knows how little knowledge he really has."<br>
<p>
Let us see what Paul says about himself in Phil 3:12-15<br>
<p>
"Not as though I has already attained either were already perfect but I follow <br>
after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ<br>
Jesus. Bretheren I COUNT NOT MYSELF TO HAVE APPPREHENDED: but this one thing I <br>
do, forgetting those things wich are behind, and reaching forth unto those <br>
things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high <br>
calling of God in Christ Jesus. LET US THEREFORE AS MANY AS BE PERFECT, be <br>
thus minded..."<br>
<p>
<p>
Now listen to what Paul says, first he says he isn't perfect, but he<br>
strives to be. Then he tells us that this is the way he considers himself to<br>
be, so that he may already be perfect but considers not to have attained.<br>
That this is in fact what he means is borne out by the last sentence in<br>
which he tells all those who are already perfect to consider themselves<br>
not to have attained as he himself does but to strive further.<br>
<p>
God is the only one who can judge perfection as He is the only one<br>
who knows the motives and the heart. So that of course we will<br>
never expect to say anyone truely perfect to claim that they are<br>
because that would mean that they would be taking upon themselves<br>
God's perogative of Judging. The bible teaches us to judge not<br>
because our judgement is faulty not only with respect to our judgements<br>
of others but also with respect to our own condition.<br>
<p>
"The heart is deceitful above all things and who can know it" Prov 13<br>
"Judge not, lest ye be judged"<br>
"Let the man who thinketh he walketh take heed lest he fall."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So what we have here is a hypothetical</i><br>
<i>&gt;possibility but extremely improbable.  Particularly if those who seemed</i><br>
<i>&gt;to live on a higher spiritual plane than most could not attain it.  So,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is essentially a moot point. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
This however is your opinion not supported neither by EGW nor the bible.<br>
<p>
1 John 2:1 "My little children, these things I write unto you, that ye sin not.<br>
            And if any man sin we have an advocate with the Father, <br>
            Jesus Christ the righteous." <br>
<p>
2 Tim 3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for<br>
           doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in<br>
           righteousness: (KJV)<br>
2 Tim 3:17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all<br>
           good works. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Phil 4:13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. (KJV)<br>
<p>
1 Thes 5:23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your<br>
            whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the<br>
            coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. (KJV)<br>
           every thought to the obedience of Christ; (KJV)<br>
<p>
Gal 5:16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust<br>
         of the flesh. (KJV)<br>
<p>
<p>
Rom 8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh,<br>
        God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,<br>
        condemned sin in the flesh: (KJV)<br>
Rom 8:4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk<br>
        not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Heb 6:1 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go<br>
        on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from<br>
        dead works, and of faith toward God, (KJV)<br>
<p>
Jude 1:24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present<br>
          you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,<br>
<p>
<p>
Matt 1:21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS:<br>
          for he shall save his people from their sins. (KJV)<br>
<p>
If <br>
1 Cor 10:13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man:<br>
            but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above<br>
            that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to<br>
            escape, that ye may be able to bear it. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Then God has made sure that we need not sin (which is what falling into<br>
temptation is) unless we choose to.<br>
<p>
Gal 2:20 I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but<br>
         Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I<br>
         live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself<br>
         for me. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Then will Christ who lives in me, commit sin ? If I am dead and the<br>
new man (Christ) dwells in me whose works  will I do ?<br>
<p>
The bible emphatically urges us on towards perfection tells us that God<br>
is able to supply our every need.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Whether or not perfection is attained</i><br>
<i>&gt;does not seemed to be the acid test of whether we are saved.  </i><br>
<p>
the attainment of perfection is not a condition of salvation<br>
but if we are not progressing towards it, it is because we are not<br>
permitting God to work in our lives. If this is the case then we are<br>
rejecting God's transforming Spirit, and in rebellion with God will<br>
(who desires and commands us to be perfect). If this is our state<br>
then we are not saved. It like faith and works. Works do not save<br>
us but the absence of works proves that we have not been saved because<br>
we don't have genuine faith but presumption.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;So why worry about?  </i><br>
<p>
The reason is because if we are truly interested in glorifying our<br>
creator we well let Him tranform our lives in such a way that <br>
the world will see Christ in us "Christ in you, that is the hope<br>
of glory" Col 2:17<br>
<p>
When Christ is manifest in our lives then we will be true witnesses<br>
and people will be drawn to Jesus, We will then be ready to receive<br>
the latter rain and the seal of God. The loaud cry will go out to<br>
the world and Christ will come to take us home. Is this reason good enough?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think that the day I start feeling like I've attained</i><br>
<i>&gt;perfection, I'm in serious trouble with self-righteous pride.</i><br>
<p>
Yep, I agree.<br>
<p>

The only thing I would say is that please do not put all SDA pastors in<br>
the one mold! I do not maintain a church office in the church that is. <br>
Through the years consistently I have driven 25,000 30,000 miles  a<br>
year. My work day usually consists of 15-16 hours. I am usually up by<br>
5:30 AM and many days do not get to bed till late. I am not lazy and I<br>
do produce along with visiting etc. I belong to 2 ministerial<br>
associations and do not know any Methodist,Baptist, Presbyterian, <br>
Catholic, or independent ministries that  do the visiting that I do.<br>
<p>
I believe perhaps that you are talking about big city church pastors<br>
perhaps. The problem with the Adventist ministries if there is a<br>
problem is that too much is expected of us out of the real ministry. <br>
By that I mean correspondence, paper work, Administration. I do not<br>
have any kind of a secretary or secretarial help.<br>
<p>
Please do not put all of us in one pot. We just do not fit!<br>
<p>

There are rumors racing around the globe that John Osborne has been<br>
caught doing some rather nasty deads.  These rumors have, for example,<br>
been getting eagerly promoted around the churches in my conference,<br>
and around the globe.<br>
<p>
Many of these rumors spring from problems related to the firing of one<br>
of John's employees, who took some of John's files with him and handed<br>
them over to the local conference.<br>
<p>
John Osborne has been able to prove to that conference that their<br>
alegations against him are false.  But the rumors persisted and even<br>
increased.  John's friend's around the world started urging him to bring<br>
a defamation of character suite against the propagators of these false<br>
rumors.  He finally has, with the result that the rumors have mostly<br>
dried up at the source, but they continue to be promoted farther out on<br>
the grape vine.<br>
<p>
While I don't happen to like some of the 'style' with which John Osborne<br>
preaches I do find a high percentage of what he has to say to be warnings<br>
worth heading.  I wish he would stick closer to simply presenting his<br>
material and quit trying to defend himself and to anticipate what the<br>
"bretherin" will do next.  And more recently he has shifted his style<br>
quite a bit.  A lot of people accuse him of distoring the truth.  But<br>
what can you say when the cameras were running.  There are times when<br>
I'm glad the video information is presented, but could pass on some of<br>
his commentary.  But that does not mean the content of what the video<br>
cameras captured on tape and audio did not happen.  If there are<br>
distortions, I find them to be at least a magnitude greater on the part<br>
of those seeking to discredit him.  Take for example videos of the<br>
Milwaukie church.  People protest that his video footage is unfair and<br>
distorting reality.  But, I have been at the home of one of their church<br>
elders watching videos of church services taken by the 'friends' of<br>
Milwaukie.  I have seen worse footage taken by those promoting the<br>
Milwaukie style than I have seen from John Osborne, trying to point<br>
out the problems.  I don't have to take someones word for it.  I've<br>
seen/heard the video footage from both sides.<br>
<p>
Dave (David E. Buxton)<br>
<p>
[Some background information:  John Osborne is the producer of an anti-<br>
celebration video that  has had rather wide circulation.  I have not seen<br>
this video, perhaps there is in fact more than one.  He is from Florida,<br>
if I mistake not.  It's difficult to know what to do about rumors<br>
on SDAnet, because now 80 people on SDAnet have heard these rumors<br>
and a seed of doubt has been planted about John Osborne's integrity. <br>
Sometimes a defensive strategy only works to spread the rumors farther.<br>
Previously I only had reason to doubt his judgment.  SDAnet is not a rumor-<br>
spreading device, we are an organization which posts the truth as we<br>
know it.  It's disturbing that those who preach "love, acceptance, and <br>
forgiveness" are forced to sink to Osborne's level to counter his arguments.<br>
The point we should keep in mind is that however repugnant or corrupt <br>
the messenger may be, we should still evaluate his message for truth <br>
contained therein.  We are not excused from getting out of the building if <br>
the fireman yells "fire" in a rude tone of voice.  On the other side, <br>
those who generate false fire alarms should not be surprised if some <br>
animosity is created.  SCT]<br>

so I'm going to try to reintroduce myself, because I noticed that I don't have<br>
any details with my name and email address which were printed with the last<br>
directory.<br>
 <br>
I'm Jerome Grimmer, a senior in Electrical Engineering at Southern Illinois Uni<br>
-versity at Carbondale, Carbondale, Illinois.  I'm very interested in computers<br>
and also seem to be the only SDA at SIUC that has bothered to get any sort of<br>
network access. :(  There are more of us here at SIU, but since they don't have<br>
mainframe accounts, they don't have network access and consequently don't know<br>
about SDA-L.  But that's beside the point.  Other interests include photo-<br>
graphy, bicycling, and of course prayer.  Hopefully next time the directory<br>
comes out this info will be added to it.<br>
 <br>
I also have an internet address (this same account) and it is ST6267@siucvmb.si<br>
u.edu, so you Internet folks can reach me at it instead of going over our slow<br>
BITnet link.  I tried to sub this account via Internet and got a message back<br>
from the Listserv saying that the list was locked, so could somebody please<br>
sub me to it via Internet and set my BITnet subscription to NOMAIL?  Thanks.<br>
 <br>

Steve, Sounds like you had a great weekend. That is good! We should<br>
hated for Randy to leave our area over at CUC to go to Andrews!<br>
<p>
We are beginning to look forward to our trip in April and May. Evelyn<br>
and I will be in Dayton, OH the last week end of April for the Dayton<br>
Hamfest!! They usually have close to 30,000 Amateurs and /or Computer<br>
enthusiasts. The Adventist "Hams" in the area prepare special services<br>
for us too. We usually have a potluck together on Sabbath at one of the<br>
churches. From there we will motor down to Burleson, TX to spend about<br>
4 days with our son and his family.<br>
<p>
This next Sabbath at Cambridge, MD church Gary Ross from the GC will be<br>
our speaker for church. After potluck we will have a Religous Liberty<br>
Rally with several of the neighboring SDA churches coming in.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;Paul&gt;&gt;<br>

Some things that everybody should consider before posting any more rounds<br>
in the "perfection" discussion.<br>
<p>
I don't care if you have fifty pages of quotes backing up your post,<br>
either pro or con.  I hope that all of us are beyond the stage where we <br>
are using the Bible and Ellen White like so many bowling balls, trying <br>
to see how many points we can score in the debate.  But as I read some of <br>
the posts, I'm afraid that the debate is degenerating into this.  So<br>
far it seems everybody is, in good faith, using the best understanding of <br>
the Bible and EGW that they have, and I cannot fault or censor them for this.<br>
<p>
But I urge you to take the time to consider the following questions:<br>
<p>
1) Could both sides be right?  Just because the two sides claim their<br>
views are mutually exclusive doesn't mean they are.<br>
<p>
2) Could both sides be wrong?  If so, then a compromise between two<br>
wrong extremes is by definition also wrong.<br>
<p>
I think in this case both sides are right and both sides are also wrong.<br>
Furthering the war will not decide who's right, only who's left.<br>
<p>
3)  Are people trying to use "creeping inspiration" here?  <br>
"Ellen White said this, and she's inspired.  Now, I'm quoting her, so<br>
you'd better pay attention to me, too."  Be very careful about making<br>
claims about Ellen White that she did not make for herself.<br>
<p>
4)  What does it matter to the heathen Chinese?  If the arsenal of <br>
theological terms we are using in this debate were not available,<br>
how would you tell someone who was just learning about Jesus how they<br>
should live?<br>
<p>
5)  Don't all of us really want to be perfect, anyway?  Why fight it?<br>
It is, after all, our goal to reflect the image of God.  Sanctification<br>
and perfection are just as much a gift of God as salvation and justification.<br>
Why are we so reluctant to take what He offers?<br>
<p>
6)  How will whatever theory you are putting forth on perfection help <br>
you love God and others better?<br>
<p>
7)  Is this whole battle just one over definitions of terms, and everyone<br>
is just trying to come to agreement?  If so, then let's continue,<br>
we are getting somewhere.<br>
<p>
We are here to communicate, not to preach at each other.  If we keep<br>
the above things in mind, we can avoid some bruised egos and theological<br>
warning flags.  (On the other hand, some of us could stand to have egos<br>
bruised a lot more often than they are.)<br>

  Thanks for the information on church growth.  Question though, do the<br>
rates cited take into account losses for the same period?  Also, what is<br>
the estimate of active members?  Does anyone have a more current figure<br>
on the total membership count (I was told 5 mil in 80's).  Thanks.<br>

Ruben,<br>
<p>
I prefer to see the work of Christ in my life as a learning, growing<br>
experience rather than an attaining, accomplishing experience.  My<br>
approach to my graduate studies is the same.  I'd rather feel that I<br>
am learning what I need for my future career than accumulating A's.<br>
I'd wish I could think like my professor and solve problems like my<br>
professor rather than obtain just knowledge.  In other words, having<br>
a relationship with my Savior is so much more important than constantly<br>
evaluating my grade in the course we are taking on this earth.  I came<br>
up with a parable over the weekend which I believe represents what I<br>
believe is God's plan and truth.<br>
<p>
We are all enrolled in Salvation 101.  This class is *SO* important to<br>
our futures that we all must pass to take the next course in life.  At<br>
our first lecture, our professor announces that everybody in the class<br>
can pass and that there is not reason any should fail.  During each<br>
lecture he will reveal some of the questions AND the answers that<br>
will be on our final exam.  After class, we all meet for lunch to talk<br>
about this.  Some bring out the college catalog which clearly states<br>
that to pass, you must get 100% on the final.  Others say they've heard<br>
that there really never is a final exam.  We are told such so we will<br>
learn the material, but there is no final exam--ever.  Some point to<br>
statistics which show a high failure rate and in fact, this professor<br>
actually tries to see how many he can flunk.  Some of us, anxious and<br>
confused, decide to go talk with the professor and find out the facts<br>
for ourselves. As the term goes by, those who think that the final<br>
exam doesn't really exist quit coming to lecture.  Those you think<br>
that they must get 100% faithfully tape record all lectures and commit<br>
them to memory word for word.  Those of us who know we can't possibly<br>
succeed are found discussing and talking over the theory with the<br>
professor in his office after hours.  We learn from the close relationship<br>
we develop with him that he's not the ogre many have made him out to<br>
be.  He really cares about his students and will do everything he can<br>
to help them succeed.  What's important to him is that we learn what<br>
we need so we are prepared for the next course.  And if he get to know<br>
him, we will understand what is important to him.  The day of the final<br>
arrives.  Those who felt the final wasn't really going to happen, don't<br>
show up.  Those who have faithfully memorized his lectures, come<br>
confident that they can't lose.  After all, wasn't every question and<br>
every answer contained in his lectures.  The rest of us come with<br>
anxiety and doubts, but we at least know that the professor won't have<br>
any trick questions because he really cares about us.  As we leave<br>
the exam room, we realize that we had learned a great deal from the<br>
class, but not enough to pass the final with 100%.  The TA comforts<br>
us as we leave.  She says, don't worry about it.  The professor grades<br>
the exams himself. Any answers that you left blank or answered incorrectly<br>
are answered by the professor himself.  Those who really got to know<br>
will realize that he knows that you all have deficiencies.  In fact,<br>
he knows that you really do know the answers for the exam because you<br>
talked about them many times in him office.  Just because you couldn't<br>
produce them for the final, doesn't mean you aren't prepared for the<br>
next course.  We sigh with relief when we realize that we have a chance<br>
afterall.  Unfortunately, those who didn't bother to show up for the<br>
exam didn't have an exam paper for the professor to fill in for them.<br>
Those you didn't get to know the professor and didn't spend time with<br>
him, must have their papers graded based the the answers they gave<br>
on the exam alone for they had no opportunity to demonstrate that they<br>
knew the principles in outside class discussions.<br>

Well Ruben, you finally said it! I have been waiting! Maybe you said it<br>
before and I missed it. You said, "When Christ is manifest in your<br>
lives...." You are now getting close to the truth.<br>
<p>
I really cannot figure out why you are so hung up on this business of<br>
sinlessness and perfection. Was this my fault? Did I say something that<br>
triggered this?<br>
<p>
Check out the message I left for David Plaistad. Since I give my life<br>
over to the Holy Spirit everyday and am in tune with him, I am counting<br>
on Him to take care of perfection and sinlessness in my life. And from<br>
all indications he is doing a fabulous job! <br>
<p>
It is a waste of time to try to prove your point of perfection and<br>
sinlessness when you are just choosing the scriptures and quotations<br>
that agree with you. If I can get over to the GC I could supply you<br>
with 40 pages (no exaggeration) of quotations from EGW that would shed<br>
an entirely different light on to what you are saying. As you probably<br>
know you have got to keep EGW in context and know the basis and reason<br>
of what she is saying. You just cannot pick out a comment here and<br>
there just because it agrees with your theology.<br>
<p>
I am not denying the fact that our goal is perfection but I do not<br>
think we will reach absolute perfection till Jesus comes. I am not<br>
denying your scriptures and quotations necessarily I am just saying<br>
what you are claiming is possible by works, I am saying is possible<br>
through the working of the HS in our lives.<br>
<p>
I agree 1000 % with Cheryl's parable. Why don't you meditate on it for<br>
a few days. I believe it would be worth the time.<br>

  If anyone is interested, there is an INTERNET site that specializes in<br>
sharing veggie recipes.  The address is<br>
<p>
  "GRANOLA: Vegetarian Discussion List" &lt;GRANOLA@brownvm.brown.edu&gt;<br>
<p>
  To sign up, send a mail item with the command "SUB GRANOLA your name"<br>
as the text of the message to LISTSERV@BROWNVM.BROWN.EDU.  Do not<br>
include the " marks in the "SUB" command you send.<br>
<p>
  If you would like the recipes that I have extracted from their log<br>
files you can FTP to me at 144.11.100.1, userid ANONYMOU, password GUEST<br>
and get the 4 files VEGGIE RECIPESx, where x is the number 1 to 4.<br>
Also, I have a separate file of food information from the same place, it<br>
is called VEGGIE FOODINFO.<br>
<p>
  All the files are less than 220k.<br>
<p>
  If you would like the files, and don't have FTP, write me and ask.<br>

Hi, new SDA-L people.<br>
 <br>
My name is Steve Timm and I'm the moderator of SDAnet, the Seventh-day<br>
Adventist discussion network.  When you post something to SDA-L, it<br>
automatically also goes out to the 80  or so subscribers of SDAnet.<br>
(But our posts are not echoed to SDA-L.)  If you were subscribed to<br>
SDAnet, you would have already received almost 100 messages this month.<br>
Our topics include some of the more volatile discussions in the SDA church<br>
today, which painful experience has taught us are best discussed on<br>
a moderated network such as SDAnet rather than an unmoderated list such<br>
as SDA-L.<br>
 <br>
If you are interested in more information on SDAnet, please drop me<br>
a line at<br>
 <br>
ST0O+SDA@ANDREW.Bitnet   or st0o+SDA@andrew.cmu.edu<br>
 <br>
I'm impressed that Christine tries to keep track of the names of everyone.<br>
There are some people that have been on my list for years that I still<br>
don't know their names.  But here is a list that comprises most of<br>
what I know about the SDAnet people.  Those with a semicolon (;)<br>
in front of the address are addresses that don't work anymore,<br>
or people that are temporarily inactive.<br>

Some of you may find this usefully illustrative and some may not.<br>
<p>
A few years ago I took a several day seminar in project management.  One<br>
of the things defined was the difference between goals and objects.<br>
Here is how the seminar speaker illustrated his terms.  NASA had as its<br>
goal the exploration of outer space.  Clearly not something that could<br>
be measured as there is no way of determining when outer space has<br>
been completely explored, or adequately explored.  It takes defineable<br>
objectives, else you make no progress against your goals.  One of the<br>
objectives that NASA established was to place a man on the moon, within<br>
'x' number of months, under 'y' dollars AND bring that man back alive.<br>
Objectives are measureable.  Do we abandon our goals because they are<br>
not measureable, because they don't seem achievable?  No.  We need to<br>
identify some clear objectives in order to make our goals meaningful.<br>
<p>
That brings us to the question:  If perfection is our goal; then what<br>
should be our objectives?  If a closer relationship with Jesus is our<br>
goal, what should be our objectives?  Daniel made a habit of openly<br>
praying three times a day, and landed in the lions den.  Daniel also<br>
purposed in his heart not to indulge in the kings food.  Paul speaks<br>
of "I die daily".  Jesus clearly spent many hours in prayer and in<br>
a thorough study of the scriptures.  By beholding Him we become changed.<br>
Faith grows like a mustard seed, from tiny beginnings into something<br>
that can move mountains; clearly not something that happens over night.<br>
<p>
If the focus of our attention is on perfection, we are overwhelmed and<br>
many simply discard and discredit such a goal right out of hand.  So<br>
many don't even try.  Or perfection is pursued in many humanly peculiar<br>
ways.  But if perfection is our serious goal and so we set out to<br>
identify our objectives -- better still, to plead for the Holy Spirit<br>
to point out the defects in our characters that need to be worked on;<br>
and God's plan that we need to be responsive to.<br>
<p>
It is God who judges a man/woman perfect.  Ellen White warns that we are<br>
not the judge in such matters.  We are not to be announcing that we<br>
are 'saved', or that we are 'perfect'.  And yet perfection is to be<br>
our goal.<br>

David, I believe there is truth is what you are saying about perfection<br>
etc. In growing up in the Adventist church I did not relate Dan. 7:10; <br>
Eccl. 12:14; Ps. 1:5 as a part of the assuring good news of the<br>
gospel. <br>
<p>
However, I discovered that David had a different feeling. He actually<br>
welcomed God to judge him. There are a number of texts to sight on this<br>
but I mention one: Ps 96:11-13 and we could sight Ps 51:3,4 as well. I<br>
believe David comprehended the terribleness of his sin and the reality<br>
of being judged by God. But he also understood the message of<br>
righteousness by faith.<br>
<p>
Scripture consistently upholds the seriousness of sin and the<br>
certainty of the judgement, however, it also reveals that the Lamb of<br>
God, our substitute, has been accepted in our place.<br>
<p>
You are on track when you say, we should allow the Holy Spirit to show<br>
us where we need to change, etc.<br>
<p>
In my study through this I had some questions when I read Christ's<br>
Object Lessons, page 155: "Those who accept the Saviour, however<br>
sincere their conversion, should never be taught to say or to feel that<br>
they are saved." What I did not understand was that in such statements<br>
EGW was refuting the erroneous belief of "once saved always saved." I<br>
thought she meant that one could never have the present assurance of<br>
salvation. How tragic that I did not see in the very same paragraph<br>
God's assurance that we can "give ourselves to Christ and know that He<br>
accepts us." And of course 1John 5:13 tells us that we may know that we<br>
have eternal life.<br>
<p>
I think I have mentioned it before that I found the same glorious<br>
revelation in the words of Ellen White:<br>
<p>
"If you give yourself to Him and accept Him as your Saviour, then, <br>
sinful as your life may have been, for His sake you are accounted<br>
righteous. Christ's character stands in place of your character, and<br>
you are accepted before God just as you had not sinned." Steps to<br>
Christ, p. 62<br>
<p>
 From my study of the Bible I have come to the conclusion that our focus<br>
should not be on perfection and sinlessness. Our focus should be on<br>
Jesus Christ and developing a relationship with Him first! Then through<br>
the Holy Spirit -- the HS will direct our lives and point out sin and<br>
weaknesses in our life. Of course we need to give the control of our<br>
lives to the Holy Spirit. Each morning when I awake, my first prayer is<br>
for the Holy Spirit to direct and take charge of my life for that day<br>
and I pray that I will be so filled with the HS that I will do and say<br>
only what he would wants me to do. My wife and I have discovered that<br>
our lives certainly go a lot better when we pray a prayer like that.<br>
<p>
Some will not agree I know with me on this next point. I understand<br>
what 1John 3:4 says that sin is the trangression of the law but sinning<br>
is just an outward syptom of an inward problem which is simply breaking<br>
off that connection with Jesus Christ through the H.S. To say it<br>
another way, sinning is an end result of breaking that contact we have<br>
with the spirit.<br>
<p>
There are 4 things we need to consider that I would be happy to discuss<br>
further. The fours things: <br>
<p>
Vision: Personal encounter with God and a clear understanding what He<br>
wants to do in and through us.<br>
<p>
Presence: This involves the integration of His presence into every area<br>
of our lives and everything that we do. If more of us realized that we<br>
really have his presence with us through the Holy Spirit there would be<br>
a lot less sinning going on and we would be more careful as to what we<br>
watch on TV or what movies we attend, as well as what we do with his<br>
holy time.<br>
<p>
Gospel: Knowing what Christ has done and is doing for us, as well as<br>
its application to how we work with ourselves and those around us. For<br>
instance if we have a good relationship with Christ through the Holy<br>
Spirit, our relationship with our wives and families are going to be<br>
better and with those about it. Simply we have a better relationship<br>
because our relationship with Christ is what it should be.<br>
<p>
When all of this finally dawned on me my relationship with my wife sky<br>
rocketed. Our relationship was always good but then it got better. <br>
Frequently daily I am telling my wife how much I love her and what a<br>
wonderful relationship we have had for 39 years. I have remarked to<br>
Evelyn, that when we got married I must not have loved her because I<br>
live her so much more now! &lt;&lt;Smile!&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
The 4th word is Lordship: This is the willingness to submit ourselves<br>
personally and corporately to God's control in all that we are have and<br>
do.<br>
<p>
In conclusion my experience as a pastor and educator has been that in<br>
the Adventist church most problems in the church and in our lives can<br>
boil down to gospel, lordship or both. We struggle with either the<br>
integration of the gospel in our lives and ministries or with the<br>
failure to submit to Christ's lordship. And the best ansers to both of<br>
these problems are vision and presence. A vision of God and what He<br>
want to do, combined with a sense of His presence, transforms the way<br>
we live and function.<br>
<p>
A strong deterrant (spelling?) against me sinning is the fact that I<br>
know I have His presence with me. If I am tempted to have an "affair" <br>
with the girl next door during the day when my wife is working, what am<br>
I going to do with his presence? Am I going to say, "Holy Spirit, you<br>
stay here while I go next door, I know you wouldn't be comfortable<br>
tagging along with me this time." No I am not going to think it even. I<br>
do not want to break that relationship with the HS. And further more I<br>
know it would not be pleasing to Him. My whole life is bent on pleasing<br>
him incidently. <br>
<p>
How about Joseph? He said to Mrs. Potiphar, "How can I do this great<br>
sin against God? I just feel that Joseph knew what relationships were<br>
all about.<br>
<p>
Some of the rules and regulations that we Adventists have grown up with<br>
just touch the "tip of the iceberg." We should be more concerned about<br>
the principle involved than the "letter of the law." And of course Alan<br>
Thompson in his book "Inspiration" deals with this concept.<br>
<p>
Success to you and God bless,<br>
<p>

I know that when I was first becoming a Seventh-day Adventist, the<br>
possibility of not sinning was a new thought to me, and made a<br>
deep impression on me.  The same thing happened to a friend of mine<br>
when I explained this to him.  He felt like it gave him some hope,<br>
that he didn't have to keep on sinning and failing.  I think that<br>
we are really missing a powerful message by ignoring the Scriptural<br>
evidence and the testimony of Ellen White and Jones and Waggoner<br>
on this topic, which I believe to be part of the message that the<br>
Lord has given to this church for the last days.<br>

Ruben: Phil 3:12-15: From the greek I would translate it this way:<br>
<p>
"I don't mean to say that I am perfect, I haven't learned all I should<br>
even yet, but I keep working toward THAT DAY when I will finally be all<br>
that Christ saved me for and wants me to be." <br>
<p>
That is the 12th verse and it is very plan to see that Paul is<br>
referring to the 2nd coming of Christ as a time of reaching<br>
perfection. Every time Paul refers to "THAT DAY" he is referring to the<br>
2nd coming.<br>
<p>
Now to continue with verse 13: "No, dear borthers, I am still not all I<br>
should be but I am bringing all my energies to bear on this one thing: <br>
Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead.<br>
<p>
v. 14: "I strain to reach the end of the race and receive the prize for<br>
which God is calling us up to heaven because of what Christ Jesus did<br>
for us."<br>
<p>
v. 15: "I hope all of you who are mature christians will see eye-to-eye<br>
with me on these things, and if you disagree on some point, I believe<br>
that God will make it plain to you  --<br>
<p>
v. 16 "if you fully obey the truth you have.<br>
<p>
Rubin, a loose translation would be, Hey guys, I'm not perfect yet, but<br>
that's my goal and I know when Christ comes I will attain it. You<br>
fellows hang in there and if you disagree with me I know the Lord will<br>
make it plain."<br>
<p>
The scripture doesn't in one tittle or iota indicate that Paul will<br>
reach perfection in this life but he along with the rest of us can<br>
strive for it and make progress in our daily walk.<br>
<p>
Paul is not saying those who are perfect or who have reached<br>
perfection, he is simply saying I want all "mature" christians to keep<br>
striving for perfection like I am and we will attain it at "that day." <br>
or at the 2nd coming.<br>
<p>
It would appear you are taking scripture out of context and making it<br>
say something that was not intended. Even the SDA commentary doesn't<br>
agree with you!<br>
<p>
A final note would be that Paul was trying refute perfectionism.  These<br>
people in Paul's day were going on the assumption that once they were<br>
baptized that they were perfect and nothing more was needed but Paul<br>
was saying, "People, even I am not perfect even though I am striving<br>
for that state, that is my goal."<br>
<p>
I've got to break for lunch.<br>

Dave, I may be completing missing your thought. My main point is that<br>
our main focus should not be on sinlessness and perfection. My main<br>
focus should be on Jesus Christ and what he can do for us.<br>
<p>
It would be for instance like making the focal point of Adventism, the<br>
Sabbath, or our teaching of the "State of the Dead" rather than on<br>
accepting Jesus Christ first and his righteousness. In my life I am<br>
counting on Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit to take care of the<br>
sinlessness and perfection in my life and I am satisfied that He is<br>
doing it!<br>

For those of you who live elsewhere than the USA, we are in the middle of <br>
a presidential campaign here.  Seventh-day Adventists have often had <br>
worries about the religious liberty views of a president.  The worries<br>
about Kennedy proved to be unfounded, and the programs such as school <br>
prayer proposed by Reagan never got off the ground.  <br>
<p>
I did not suspect that we would have candidates in the race with worse<br>
religious liberty positions than Bush, but we certainly do.  Pat<br>
Buchanan with his Jesuit education and his call "we've aided everybody<br>
else, now it's the turn of Irish Catholics" scares me.  Jerry Brown<br>
is also Jesuit-educated, though it seems he may have forgotten some<br>
of his lessons.  Tom Harkin is another Jesuit product.   <br>
<p>
[Yes, yes, I know--so are several SDA's including a Bible teacher of mine<br>
whom I love and respect for leading me to Christ.  But I'm still scared <br>
of the above people.]<br>
<p>
Probably none of the above three candidates will win.  Does anyone have<br>
any idea of the record of Tsongas, Clinton, or Kerrey?<br>

<p>
<i>&gt;I prefer to see the work of Christ in my life as a learning, growing</i><br>
<i>&gt;experience rather than an attaining, accomplishing experience.  My</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We are all enrolled in Salvation 101.  This class is *SO* important to</i><br>
<i>&gt;our futures that we all must pass to take the next course in life.</i><br>
<p>
	I've been following this thread pretty closely, and I think I<br>
finally found some time to put my $.02 worth in.  I think Ruben's<br>
statements have been very reflective of what I believe.<br>
	I have to disagree with the parable, Cheryl.  I hope you don't<br>
take anything personally, as we always seem to get on opposite sides<br>
of the debate ;-).  I'll try to be brief and hit some main points about<br>
what I think.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;our first lecture, our professor announces that everybody in the class</i><br>
<i>&gt;can pass and that there is not reason any should fail.  During each</i><br>
<i>&gt;lecture he will reveal some of the questions AND the answers that</i><br>
<i>&gt;will be on our final exam.  After class, we all meet for lunch to talk</i><br>
<p>
	Contrast Romans 5:18.  "Consequently, just as the result of one<br>
trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of<br>
righteousness was justification that brings life for all men."  I would<br>
put the emphasis on _all men_.  I think that Jesus was the one who has<br>
already taken our final exam and passed.  The trials and temptations that<br>
come in life are not to test whether Jesus really did save us, but rather<br>
to strengthen our faith that he DID.  Reference James 1:2-4, "Consider it<br>
pure joy, my brothers, wehn you face trials... so that you may be mature<br>
and complete, not lacking in anything."  (Please correct me if I'm barking<br>
up the wrong tree here.)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The rest of us come with</i><br>
<i>&gt;anxiety and doubts, but we at least know that the professor won't have</i><br>
<i>&gt;any trick questions because he really cares about us.  As we leave</i><br>
<p>
	Contrast James 1:6-8.  "But when he asks, he must believe and<br>
not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and<br>
tossed by the wind.  That man should not think he will receive anything<br>
from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does."  I<br>
think that  James is saying it is a pretty serious offense to doubt God,<br>
especially about our salvation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Just because you couldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;produce them for the final, doesn't mean you aren't prepared for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;next course.  We sigh with relief when we realize that we have a chance</i><br>
<i>&gt;afterall.</i><br>
<p>
	I think the focus of salvation 101 has gone from faith to works.<br>
That is, _you_ are taking the final, it is _your_ holiness that gives you<br>
the right to pass the final.  Where you fail, God will just wink his eye<br>
and pretend it never happened.<br>
	I would have to rewrite the parable, personally, for it is not<br>
God who gives the exams (trials.)  His relationship to us is more than<br>
a Teacher, but more as a Father who spends all his time, energy, and most<br>
valuable rescorces to give us every advantage to pass the trials.  Even<br>
when we do do pass through trials, it is not victory by our strength and<br>
effort.  "...I no longer live, but Christ lives in me."  Gal. 2:20.<br>
<p>
	Hmm, perhaps we're talking about two different things, and I<br>
interpreted your parable incorrectly.  If so, please let me know.<br>

Steve,  (You do not have to post this on the SDA net, use your own<br>
judgement).<br>
<p>
My experience with churches and members through the years has indicated<br>
to me that a large section of Adventists vote Republican. However, it<br>
seems that not considering religious affliations, that Democrats are<br>
more supportive to our Religious Liberty ideals.<br>
<p>
We, Evelyn and I, have not had religious affliations and religious<br>
views high on our priorities, in fact not even a priority. We have<br>
tried to make our decision on the candidates in their abilities to<br>
accomplish what we feel is needful for our country. Perhaps religious<br>
views should play a larger role in our decisions.<br>
<p>
I think Bush has a uphill battle ahead of him. BTW, to help you<br>
understand better our disregard of religious affliation, -- Once in<br>
Fla. in a state election one of the candidates obtained a mailing list<br>
of all the SDA members in Fla and wrote them to vote for him that he<br>
was in favor of their beliefs especially on Rel. Lib, etc. <br>
<p>
My dad had dinner with the other candidate and found out the other<br>
candidate was in just as much favor as the other one. Just because a<br>
candidate is catholic or jesuite does not necessarily mean they will be<br>
trouble for SDAs. It depends on the individual and their own personal<br>
views. <br>
<p>
Why don't you contact Gary Ross at the GC. Their phone number is <br>
301-680-6000 I believe. Gary is the Liason between the GC and<br>
Congress. He might have some info. If I would have known last week, <br>
Gary Ross preached at our church and had a RL rally in the afternoon.<br>
<p>
Take care,<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;Paul&gt;&gt;<br>

[From David Buxton]<br>
The following appeared in "Adventist Affirm",  Spring  1991.   The  editor's<br>
note:<br>
<p>
     The following is condensed from a talk given ten years ago to a  church<br>
     growth  seminar  held  at Andrews University and which was subsequently<br>
     published in Ministry, February 1982.  It is reproduced here by permis-<br>
     sion.   Though  the statistics have not been updated, the points remain<br>
     significant.<br>
<p>
What follows is quoted, with about 50% deleted using . . . . . .  .  .    At<br>
one  point  I make clear what I am saying in my words instead of quoting the<br>
text of the article.<br>

<p>
HOW ADVENTISM CAN STOP GROWING<br>
<p>
Dean M. Kelley<br>
<p>
Executive Director for Religious Liberty<br>
National Council of Churches<br>
Author, Why Conservative Churches Are Growing<br>
<p>
WHY DO SOME DENOMINATIONS FLOURISH WHILE OTHERS DECLINE?  A METHODIST MINIS-<br>
TER TELLS ADVENTISTS HOW THEY CAN STOP GROWING!<br>
<p>
It's a little ironic, I think, that  somebody  from  one  of  the  declining<br>
churches  should  come to talk about church growth to a body that is growing<br>
at very significant, precisely constant rates.  Church growth seminars  such<br>
as this may facilitate some of the mechanics of bringing growth about, but I<br>
believe denominations basically grow or decline  because  of  something  far<br>
more  profound  and basic -- whether or not they are good religious institu-<br>
tions.  If they are not able to meet people's religious needs,  they're  not<br>
going to grow.<br>
<p>
The mainline ecumenical bodies are declining, by and large, because they are<br>
not meeting people's religious needs.  They may be very good as adult educa-<br>
tion institutions, or entertainment arenas, or baby-sitting enterprises,  or<br>
any  number  of other things, but they're not making the grade as religions.<br>
It isn't a matter of how much energy they have; it's what they use  it  for,<br>
and what they understand themselves to be doing.<br>
<p>
. . . . . . . .<br>
<p>
MEMBERSHIP PATTERNS.  If you look at  the  membership  curves  of  mainline,<br>
national  denominations  from 1958 to 1974 (these are the curves used in the<br>
paperback 1977 edition of my book "Why Conservative Churches Are  Growing"),<br>
you  will  see  traces of one of the most interesting phenomena of the twen-<br>
tieth century.  Certain of the so-called mainline, national Protestant reli-<br>
gious bodies that had been following the population escalator for nearly two<br>
hundred years suddenly stopped going up, peaked,  and  started  down.   That<br>
isn't easy to do, but we managed to do it in the mid-sixties!<br>
<p>
. . . . . . . .<br>
<p>
Summarazing the next two long paragraphs &gt;&gt;&gt;  He  describes  three  Lutheran<br>
church  bodies.   One  was  strongly  ecumenical  and  a  member of both the<br>
National Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches.  The  second<br>
was less ecumenical and a member of the W.C.C.  The third was even less ecu-<br>
menical, belonging to neither organization.  His observations would  suggest<br>
that  being  ecumenical is the kiss of death for a church.  The first church<br>
went into steep decline, the 2nd was not as precipitous and the  third  took<br>
longer  before going into its decline.  During the same time period the con-<br>
servative churches were demonstrating strong growth curves. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
. . . . . . . .  The Methodist Church merged with the Evangelical and United<br>
Brethren  in 1968, and rather than the merger serving as a shot of adrenalin<br>
to the larger group, they both went down together. . . . . . . .<br>
<p>
. . . . . . . .<br>
<p>
GROWING CHURCHES . . . . . . .<br>
<p>
. . . . . . . . Jehovah's Witnesses have the highest rate of increase of all<br>
of  those  on  the chart.  They run clear off the board up to about 240 per-<br>
cent, and then they have a sudden glitch, drop down, and then head up again.<br>
Their  last  figure was more than 250 percent of their 1958 membership!  Why<br>
this glitch?  The editor of the 'Yearbook of  American  Churches'  tells  me<br>
that  they predicted the end of the world again, and that produced a certain<br>
drop as a result of disappointment.  But they'll take off again and keep  on<br>
going, I expect, for quite a while.<br>
<p>
WHY? . . . . . .<br>
<p>
I have my ideas of why it happened.  For instance,  I  believe  that  strict<br>
membership requirements were very important in maintaining church growth, as<br>
well as rigorous theological assertiveness.  Not indoctrination so  much  as<br>
the  idea,  "This  is  what  we believe, and we stand by this.  If you don't<br>
believe it too, you don't belong here."<br>
<p>
. . . . . . . .<br>
<p>
RELIGIOUS FUNCTION. . . . . . . . . .<br>
<p>
. . . . . . . .<br>
<p>
. . . . . . . .<br>
<p>
. . . . . . . .<br>
<p>
The great religious movements have the ability to take a handful of unassum-<br>
ing  little  men  and  women  who,  because of their total commitment to the<br>
explanation of life that a charismatic leader  at  their  center  has  given<br>
them,  are  lifted  up in the scale of human enterprise till the rest of the<br>
world slopes down from them.  and they become the index of what it means  to<br>
be really human.  That happened in Britain in the eighteenth century, in the<br>
Wesleyan revival, where it changed people's  expectations  of  one  another.<br>
People  no longer were willing to put up with the corruption and the exploi-<br>
tation and the victimization  that  was  going  on  in  that  society.   The<br>
Wesleyan revival transformed England.<br>
<p>
WHY SOME PROSPER.  Well now suppose that is the function of religion.   Then<br>
why do some groups succeed with it and others do not?  Why does one religion<br>
appeal to those with religious needs better than another?  I don't know  the<br>
answer  to  that.  What I do know, I think, is the one 'sine qua non' of the<br>
meaning business:  The thing that counts in providing a meaning for life  is<br>
not whether it's logical or rational or consistent or coherent or entertain-<br>
ing or ego-stroking.  The thing that counts is the cost.  How much  does  it<br>
cost  you  to follow this gospel?  The function of religion depends upon its<br>
being a religion that answers people's meaning needs.  And I  would  contend<br>
that  it  is  effective  in doing that to the degree that it costs people to<br>
belong to that group.<br>
<p>
In the realm of religion, money is cheap.  Now it's a lot cheaper for Metho-<br>
dists  than it is for Adventists, or maybe the other way around, because the<br>
per capita giving rates are very different. The Seventh-day-Adventists  just<br>
about  lead  the  field  in  the amount of money they are willing to give to<br>
their church.  Methodists are way down somewhere, and Episcopalians are down<br>
farther yet.<br>
<p>
DISCIPLESHIP LEVELS.  But money is cheap.  That's just the  first  level  of<br>
commitment.  After someone cares enough about the promulgation of the gospel<br>
that he is willing to tithe to support it, then he's on the first  level  of<br>
discipleship.  After that comes the giving of one's own time. . . . . . Most<br>
of the religious bodies have not even gotten to the first step. . . . . .  .<br>
. . . . .  That's what passes for religion in most churches, including mine.<br>
<p>
HOW TO STOP GROWING.  What I have to say next might be pointed up best if  I<br>
speak  about how the Seventh-day Adventist church can stop growing and begin<br>
declining like the Methodists.  I'm sure you want to know that!   There  are<br>
several ways in which the Adventists could become like the rest of us, and I<br>
would be surprised if there were not, somewhere among its advanced thinkers,<br>
some who have unknowingly found them already .  I don't know; I'm not refer-<br>
ring to any individuals.  But judging from other churches, including my own,<br>
I  would  suggest  that there may be those who are offering what they fondly<br>
hope will be seen as brave and startling new insights.<br>
<p>
If Adventists want to stop growing and begin declining like everybody  else,<br>
all  they  have to do is to emphasize that abstinence from alcohol, tobacco,<br>
and caffeine isn't really essential to salvation. Decide that  vegetarianism<br>
isn't  actually  all that important, and foot-washing is a little tacky--too<br>
much like those hill-billy Pentecostals in  the  Ozarks.   Recognizing  that<br>
membership  in  labor  unions sometimes might be not altogether a bad thing,<br>
and that tithing, like the requirements already mentioned, can be a form  of<br>
righteousness  by works.  And (I am almost unable to mention this) introduce<br>
the idea that one can worship as well on Sunday as on Saturday!<br>
<p>
You have probably never heard any of those ideas before, but those  who  are<br>
on  the advanced edges of religious thought may sometimes come upon them.  I<br>
don't want to belittle entirely the necessary role of those whose task it is<br>
to  go about and test the pilasters and the stanchions and the other pillars<br>
that hold up a temple, to make sure they're not  deteriorating.   But  some-<br>
times  they  also discover that the church doesn't need this one, it doesn't<br>
need that one, and that all these quaint and peculiar truths are really just<br>
trimming on the cake--all that one needs is love or faith.<br>
<p>
TOO EASY.  If rightly understood, it may be true that love or faith  is  all<br>
one  needs.  But the trouble with these unstructured simplifications is that<br>
they're too easy.  There is almost nothing you cannot justify doing, if  you<br>
hold  yourself  only to the criterion of love as you interpret it.  It's too<br>
easy.  It is too self-indulgent.  Rather than being guilt-ridden, most of us<br>
are  prone  to  be  innocence-ridden,  that  is,  to find justifications and<br>
excuses for doing what we want to do anyway.  And if we can  justify  it  in<br>
the  name of love, all the better.  These oversimplifications are inadequate<br>
because they deprive faith of its unique and necessary texture and  practice<br>
and cost.<br>
<p>
RIGOROUS DEMANDS.  I would suggest that  there  need  to  be  a  few  rather<br>
rigorous and specific demands in every religious group to bolster its expla-<br>
nation of life and make it convincing, because convincingness  derives  from<br>
seriousness,  which derives from strictness.  How can a religion expect any-<br>
one to take it seriously if it doesn't take itself seriously?  The Church of<br>
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints requires each of its members to put in two<br>
years as missionaries.  Not at the expense of the church, but at  their  own<br>
expense!  And the Mormons are increasing, not in spite of that requirements,<br>
but 'because' of it!  What is the point of being a Seventh-day Adventist  if<br>
an  Adventist's  religious  duty and activity becomes indistinguishable from<br>
that of a lukewarm Methodist or Presbyterian?<br>
<p>
The things that I have mentioned about  tithing,  the  seventh-day  Sabbath,<br>
foot-washing,  et cetera, are the things that make the Seventh-day Adventist<br>
movement unique, distinctive, and demanding.  They give  it  its  bite,  its<br>
convincingness, its seriousness.  Each church needs its own way of insisting<br>
that "you've got to live up to this to be one of  us."   If  you  strip  the<br>
requirements all away, you can render the movement feeble, pallid, and ordi-<br>
nary overnight.  So there's  the  answer  to  the  question:   How  can  the<br>
Seventh-day Adventist church stop growing?  Be like the Methodists.<br>
<p>
MAXIMS OF SERIOUSNESS.  I was asked by my publisher . . . . . .  At the  end<br>
of the book, I listed several maxims of seriousness:<br>
<p>
DISTINCT.  First, those who are serious about their faith do not confuse  it<br>
with  other  beliefs,  loyalties,  or  practices,  or  mingle  them together<br>
indiscriminately, or pretend they are alike, of  equal  merit,  or  mutually<br>
compatible, if they are not.<br>
<p>
DEMANDING.  Second, those who  are  serious  about  their  faith  make  high<br>
demands of those admitted to the organization that bears the faith.  They do<br>
not include or allow to continue within it those who are not fully committed<br>
to  it.   For decades there hasn't been anything you could do that would get<br>
you drummed out of the Methodist Church.  But John Wesley, in  his  journal,<br>
describes  how  he came to one of his little societies in Bristol, and found<br>
there among the eighteen members a number of triflers and  dissemblers.   He<br>
says,  "I made short work of them."  After he left, there were seven members<br>
of the society.  And it was much stronger!<br>
<p>
DISCIPLINED.  Third, those who are serious about their faith do not  consent<br>
to,  encourage,  or  indulge  any  violations  of its standards of belief or<br>
behavior by its professed adherents.<br>
<p>
DEFINITIVE.  Fourth, those who are serious about their  faith  do  not  keep<br>
silent about it, apologize for it, or let it be treated as though it made no<br>
difference or should make no difference in their behavior  or  relationships<br>
with others.  Now I know it's true that there is no particular thing you can<br>
do to commend yourself to God.  But there are a lot of  things  you  can  do<br>
that  will separate yourself from God.  They are called sins, and we do them<br>
all the time.  But true, effective religious  faith  requires  that  you  do<br>
something  different,  that you be something different than you would other-<br>
wise do or be if you  didn't have it.  It must make some significant differ-<br>
ence  in  your life, something that will cost you a lot, because that's what<br>
makes religion work.  If it doesn't cost, it can't be worth much.<br>

<i>&gt;&lt; Steve's concerns about Jesuit candidates</i><br>
<p>
I have two books by Malachi Martin who is an ex-Jesuit and now a<br>
prophesor at the Pontifical University.  I also have some news<br>
clippings from Canada.  It would seem that the Jesuits are no<br>
longer the "Pope's Men" as they used to be.  They have been too<br>
good at snubbing the Popes and so John Paul has been grooming<br>
a couple of groups to replace them.  Also, according to Malachi<br>
Martin the Jesuits are now much too strong on Marxist politics.<br>
One of the key candidates for a close relationship with the Papacy<br>
is the Opus Dei, often referred to as the Papal Maffia.  They do<br>
not wear clarical garb, much preferring to dress like laymen and<br>
get into a lot of trouble in Canada for their infiltrating activities.<br>
Even the pro Catholic press of Canada has at times spoken its<br>
concerns about the Opus Dei and its rough tactics.  One of their<br>
key statements of their founding father was - in my words - "Why is<br>
it that when we forcibly rescue someone from commiting suicide we get a<br>
lot of supportive aclaim, but when we forcibly rescue someone from<br>
killing his own soul we get into trouble for it?"<br>
<p>
It is much easier to identify a Jesuit or former Jesuit than the Opus Dei.<br>
<p>

Interesting article.  One thing that disturbs me though, is the conspicuous<br>
absence of any mention of the Holy Spirit's work in the growth of the Body.<br>

<i>&gt; My experience with churches and members through the years has</i><br>
<i>&gt; indicated to me that a large section of Adventists vote Republican.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, it seems that not considering religious affliations, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; Democrats are more supportive to our Religious Liberty ideals.</i><br>
<p>
I am not sure this is the place to debate the merits and demerits of<br>
our two main political parties.  A couple of points, however.<br>
<p>
1.  Republicans tend to favor issues like support for private schools,<br>
religious displays in public places, and so on.  Religious liberty<br>
advocates wring their hands over these items.<br>
<p>
2.  Democrats favor big government and intrusion into people's lives.<br>
Religious liberty advocates don't wring their hands about this but<br>
they should, since the threat is the same or worse as that from<br>
Republicans.<br>
<p>
3.  Libertarians really do want government out of people's lives and<br>
thus from a pure religious liberty standpoint are preferable to the<br>
other parties.  However, if you want government that has "values" and<br>
is "moral", Libertarians are not the way to go.<br>
<p>
4.  Religous liberty advocates have never solved the problem<br>
highlighted in point #3.  It is hard for a government to have values<br>
without having a basis for those values.<br>

I chatted last week with a good friend who is currently in New York City.<br>
He is a credentialed SDA minister from Trinidad, but has not worked for<br>
the denomination since he has been in the US (about 5 years now).  He<br>
told me about a church that he and several other Caribbean ministers<br>
started up in NYC.  They formed an independent church -- no formal<br>
affiliation with the denomination, all tithes and offerings retained in<br>
the local church (I believe).  They cared for the needy among them.  If<br>
some were out of work, then the church gave them subway money so they<br>
could go out and look for new jobs.  If families were so strapped that<br>
their kids had no allowance, then the church would give the kids a little<br>
pocket money every week.  Some families had their rent paid by the church<br>
during times of emergency; others got groceries.  Plus they saved over<br>
$100,000 toward buying a permanent meeting place.  The church grew very<br>
rapidly, and was vibrant and missionary-minded.<br>
 <br>
Recently they joined the denomination officially, mainly because of the<br>
desire to have a church building of their own.  I'm not sure of the details<br>
here, but it seems to have killed the spirit, according to my friend.  He's<br>
now firmly committed to independent ministry and congretational churches.<br>
 <br>
Any thoughts?  My first impression was that it sounded like the church after<br>
Pentecost to a degree.  Is there a limit to the need for organization?<br>
Have we grown the the point where the beauracracy is now holding us back<br>
rather than helping us move on?  (I'm suddenly unsure of how to spell<br>
bureaucracy -- I think the second attempt is better!)<br>
 <br>
With the posting of the article by the Methodist who said he could tell<br>
the church how to stop growing, I wondered whether there is a magic size<br>
of some sort.  As long as we're a small group, we keep our peculiarity and<br>
continue to grow rapidly (at least percentage-wise).  As we get larger<br>
we grow more diverse, less peculiar, and our percentage-wise growth<br>
necessarily drops.  I think the same could be said for individual<br>
congregations as well.<br>

Lola raised some interesting posts about congregationalism, also <br>
reminding me of a post of Dennis Grumling on this topic to which I <br>
never responded.<br>
<p>
I don't think that size and diversity are necessarily limits to growth.<br>
The fastest-growing churches in the country are the so-called<br>
"megachurches" which can have thousands of members.  What limits growth<br>
is if a congregation<br>
turns inward, develops a narrow vision, and starts getting comfortable<br>
feeling "big enough."<br>
<p>
"Local church first" is a buzzword that is becoming more popular for <br>
conference leaders to mouth.  The wishes of congregations are now<br>
being taken into account more often when hiring pastors and planning <br>
outreach activities.  <br>
<p>
I think it would be a shame to focus on the local church to the exclusion <br>
of the world church.  We are organized together, partly to spread the <br>
gospel to those areas of the world that still need to hear it.  Even <br>
foreign missions is becoming congregationalized, with congregations<br>
sponsoring individual missionaries.  It is fine to personalize it so <br>
long as we don't disorganize it in so doing.<br>

Lola, How abt small group ministries? I think particularly in large<br>
churches like the Hope church -- where is it -- Oregon? has good success<br>
with Small Groups.<br>
<p>
Another thing to consider is whenever a new church organizes there always<br>
is a lot of fervor, and "on fire."  You have to develop a church plan to<br>
keep that fervor going. I was pastor in a church for 8 years and that is a<br>
long time for a SDA pastorate. Every year we had a new program going on<br>
and helped the people develop their spiritual gifts. During those 8 years<br>
the people never did lose their high spirit and fervor.<br>
<p>
The church was without a pastor for 6 months after I left. You would have<br>
never known there was not a pastor because the laity were carrying the<br>
ball as they had been trained to do so. I am not suggesting Lola, that<br>
"plans" are a Saviour. However, you do need a plan! It is good to have a<br>
1, 3, and 5 year plan and plans so you know where you are headed and what<br>
your goals are.<br>

I have been exposed to congregationalism to some degree and have decided that <br>
it is neither better or worse than our structure. The problems they have are <br>
just different than the ones we face. For instance, in congregational churches<br>
more local resources are involved in caring for the pastor: e.g. medical <br>
coverage, tax issues, salary issues, etc. Also it is more difficult for <br>
congregational churches to have an effective mission program without the aid <br>
of outside organizations.<br>
<p>
That is not to say that congregationalism is without its good points. Often <br>
there is a more personal feeling to congregational churches. Lola pointed out <br>
the results of the change in New York. I think Steve's comments hit the nail <br>
on the head. When churches join organizations they often expect the <br>
organization to fulfill their responsibilities. The problem as described by <br>
Lola is that the energy shifted from caring for the immediate needs of the <br>
local people to caring for the needs of a world of people. I am sure that <br>
resources which had previously been used to help locally were now going into <br>
the organization which can help the rest of the world.<br>
<p>
Believe me, I know that the organization absorbs a lot of money. There are <br>
probably areas where we could save money if we put our minds to it. The <br>
problem in the church, however, is not much different than the problem faced <br>
by the leaders of our country. To cut spending means to take money away from <br>
someone who believes that they need it. One person's pork barrel is another <br>
man's livelihood. <br>
<p>
The bottom line for me is that I don't believe congregationalism will save the<br>
mission of our church. I agree with Steve that putting the local church needs <br>
first to the exclusion of the world church would not be good. We will all have<br>
to bite the bullet and accept that it costs money to do things. We might have <br>
to accept that to have money for one project may mean doing away with another.<br>
I personally pastor three congregations in the San Francisco Bay Area. Some of<br>
my church members are upset by that, but in other parts of the world pastors <br>
have many more churches than that. Where are our priorities? What can we <br>
reasonably expect from the organization?<br>

Very good thoughts, Steve. While I was reading your messages I was<br>
thinking about 2 congregations that are having outstanding growth and are<br>
pastored by lay people who have other full time jobs. You could conclude I<br>
suppose from that, that pastors stiffle growth!! Not really, these two<br>
churches are new churches -- people really active -- and right along with<br>
that they have some laity "spark plugs" that really get the people going<br>
in the right direction.<br>
<p>
Ray &amp; Madalyn Hamblin in Adrian/Tecumseh, Mich. are like that. They both<br>
were and still are spark plugs in the Adrian church. Ray can really<br>
challenge the members and they are ready the follow him and the pastor. <br>
It was thrilling to be their pastor. While I was there with God's blessing<br>
we not only increased the membership in Adrian but planted a new church <br>
in Tecumseh. Dr Gordon Guild and his wife Carol are also spark plugs in<br>
the Tecumseh church.<br>

Ray is the national president of ASI now. He owns Hamblin Printing Co. in<br>
Tecumseh. He has done some of my printing that we have inserted in the<br>
local newspapers. We went from churches that had no interest names at all<br>
to over 500 names in our files at present. Over half of them have<br>
requested Bible studies and we are actively and have been actively<br>
following them up. In addition to that we  have many who have requested<br>
other seminars that we conduct each year.<br>
<p>
The answer is to equip the saints so that they can work in concert with<br>
the pastor.<br>

Some SDAs point to the health principles advocated by Ellen White as <br>
being unique and far ahead of the thinking of her time.  I would like <br>
to share some passages with you that were written by a nonSDA <br>
religious leader between 1851 and 1877.  (EGW's first health vision <br>
dates to 1860s)  He talks of the dangers of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, <br>
and tea, advocates a vegetarian diet and simplicity in diet, sleeping <br>
and living in fresh, pure air.  He evens talks of prenatal influence of <br>
alcohol and narcotics and the effect of an unbridled appetite on the <br>
spiritual, mental, and physical life.  He speaks of the need for <br>
exercise, eating well-baked bread, drinking fresh cool water, and <br>
many health principles that SDAs usually attribute to being uniquely <br>
Ellen White's.  It is probably this claim by SDAs who haven't <br>
explored the literature of her time that has lead me to personally <br>
reject the idea that "the health message" is a sign of prophetic <br>
inspiration.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
"Satisfying the appetite brings to an end the pleasure of eating; and <br>
where food is partaken of chiefly to gratify the pleasurable sensation <br>
derived from eating, disease is engendered, and true misery springs <br>
out of this unwise gratification.  Some healthy, strong-constitutioned <br>
person can eat large quantities of food with apparent impunity; but, <br>
in so doing, the tax they place upon their systems will ultimately <br>
bring disease and death.  8:139<br>
<p>
"The constitution that a person has should be nourished and <br>
cherished; and whenever we take anything into the system to force <br>
and stimulate it beyond its natural capacity, it shortens life."  7:337<br>
<p>
"Let the mother impregnate her system with these narcotic <br>
influences when she is bringing forth a family on the earth, and what <br>
does she do?  She lays the foundation of weakness, palpitation of the <br>
heart, nervous affections, and many other ills and diseases in the <br>
system of her offspring that will afflict them from the cradle to the <br>
grave."  13:276<br>
<p>
"Mankind would not become attached to these unnecessary articles <br>
were it not for the poison they contain.  The poisonous or narcotic <br>
properties in spirits, tobacco and tea are the cause of their being so <br>
much like by those who use them." 13:276<br>
<p>
"Then let us seek to extend the present life to the uttermost, by <br>
observing every law of health, and by properly balancing labor, <br>
study, rest, and recreation, and thus prepare for a better life." 11:132<br>
<p>
"So we see that almost the very first teachings the first Elders of this <br>
Church received were as to what to eat, what to drink, and how to <br>
order their natural lives that they might be united temporally as <br>
well as spiritually.  This is the great purpose which God has in view <br>
in sending to the world, by his servants, the Gospel of life and <br>
salvation.  12:158<br>
<p>
"This is the duty of the human family, instead of wasting their lives <br>
and the lives of their fellow-beings, and the precious time God has <br>
given us to improve our minds and bodies by observing the law of <br>
life, so that the longevity of the human family may begin to return."  <br>
14:89<br>
<p>
"Do you think they will stuff themselves then with tea and coffee, <br>
and perhaps with a little brandy sling before breakfast and a little <br>
before going to bed, and then beef, pork, mutton, sweet meats, and <br>
pastry, morning, noon and night?  No; you will find they will live as <br>
our first parents did, on fruits and on a little simple food, and they <br>
will never overload the stomach."  12:37<br>
<p>
"If the people were willing to receive the true knowledge from <br>
heaven in regard to their diet they would cease eating swine's flesh. . <br>
. Fish is as healthy as food as we can eat, if we except vegetables and <br>
fruit, and with them will become a very wholesome diet."  12:192<br>
<p>
"The Americans, as a nation, are killing themselves with their vices <br>
and high living.  As much as a man ought to eat in half an hour they <br>
swallow in three minutes, gulping down their food like the canine <br>
quadruped under the table, which, when a chunk of meat is thrown <br>
down to it, swallows it before you can say "twice"."  13:153-154<br>
<p>
"Good pure air is the greatest sustainer of animal life.  Other <br>
elements of life we can dispense with for a time, but this seems to be <br>
essential every moment; hence the necessity of well ventilated <br>
dwellings-houses, especially the rooms occupied for sleeping.  You <br>
can live without water and food longer than you can without air, and <br>
water is of more importance than meat and bread."  8:168<br>
<p>
"The out-door air is what the people need for health, it is good for <br>
them to camp out.  Close houses are injurious to the health; if our <br>
houses were every one of them levelled to the ground, and we were <br>
obliged to live in our wagons and tents, the people would be <br>
healthier, from year to year, than they are now.  Good houses are <br>
comfortable and very convenient, and please our feelings, and are <br>
tolerably healthful when properly ventilated."  2:284<br>
<p>
"We should have plenty of pure, fresh air.  If children are kept in <br>
close bedrooms, they become puny and weakly.  Let them sleep <br>
where they can have abundance of pure air, in well-ventilated <br>
rooms, or out-of-doors, in the summer time, in a safe place;  it will be <br>
most beneficial for their health."  12:218<br>
<p>
"Do you know that it is your privilege so to live that your minds may <br>
all the time be perfectly within your control?  Study to preserve <br>
your bodies in life and health, and you will be able to control your <br>
minds."  8:135<br>
<p>
"My mind becomes tired, and perhaps some of yours do.  If so, go <br>
and exercise your bodies."  6:148<br>
<p>
"As for health, it is far healthier to walk than to ride, and better <br>
every way for the people."  4:103<br>
<p>
"Mothers, keep the children from eating meat; and let them eat <br>
vegetables that are fully matured, not unripe, and bread that is well-<br>
baked, not soft."  19:67<br>
<p>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
So, are you curious about who wrote these health messages?  These <br>
were spoken by the Mormon leader and prophet, Brigham Young, <br>
who was also the first governor of the Utah territory.  Surprised?  <br>
Yea, I was too.  The numbers after each item are the volume and<br>
pagesof the "Journal of Discourses" where these can be found.  MY<br>
source was the book, "Discourses of Brigham Young" compiled by<br>
John A. Widtsoe published in 1954.  I invite your comments, either<br>
via private email or SDAnet postings.<br>

While vacationing this past summer I was involved in a Sabbath School<br>
Class which used sharing scripture.  The people were ages 20 to about 35<br>
or 40.  The discussion was alive, real, honest and personel.  I was<br>
impressed by the whole experience.  I did not get a chance to talk with<br>
the leader and therefore did not find out where the lessons might be<br>
obtained.  I would be appreciative if you could share this information!<br>
We need lesson helps that will help us be relevant to our relationships<br>
with others and assist us in being transparent and honest about our own<br>
shortcomings.  How else do we grow?!<br>

SDAs do *not* officially see the food laws as still binding.<br>
<p>
Our dietary practices have more to do with general health principles<br>
than with staying kosher. That's the official line, anyway. Individual <br>
SDAs may disagree.<br>
<p>
The process of growth and maturity as a people of God has taken us<br>
beyond the "Mummy said not to touch" stage to the "it's dangerous and<br>
painful to pick up a hot saucepan" stage. There are many things in<br>
the ceremonial law that are good sense, even in a civilized society.<br>
Other things were specifically given to deal with the problems of<br>
being a desert nomad, or the politics of living in an imperfect<br>
theocracy or under some despot king.<br>
<p>
By the way, when I referred to the people of God, I was thinking in<br>
the long-scale historical sense, from Sinai right through to the<br>
twentieth century.<br>

A few days ago, someone posted a derogatory statement against American's<br>
United for Separation of Chuirch and state.  It seemed to imply that they<br>
were a greater  danger to Religious Liberty than Jerry Falwell.  Also  this<br>
post seemed to attack the principle of Separation of Church and State.<br>
<p>
No one questioned him.  I must be completely out of touch for I am a member<br>
of that organization and I do believe in the principle of Separation.<br>
<p>
I would like to hear other views.  Also I would like to get the name<br>
and state of the Adventist Congressman.  What are his views on separation.<br>
I know he is Republican.<br>
<p>
Thank You<br>

In the past few years there has been a new type of Sabbath School lesson<br>
that is geared at relational Bible study.  It comes as a discussion guide<br>
and usually just comprises the front and back of one sheet of paper.<br>
Included in it are some key texts, and several discussion scenarios.<br>
It's called "Sharing Scripture."  I don't know where it is available from <br>
but can find out if needed, since my mother writes for them regularly.<br>
<p>
Has anyone out there used this lesson?  What are your experiences with it,<br>
if so?<br>

One of the more disturbing things lately is the resurgence of a *very* <br>
narrow view on the Three Angels message, Mark of the Beast, etc.. The <br>
ENTIRE Christian message is that salvation (justification, sanctification, <br>
glorification) is accomplished by Christ ALONE. The essence of ALL false <br>
religion is that you can do it yourself. Conversly everything about my <br>
behavior, relationships to others and relationship to God's creation is <br>
rooted in Christ. To make part of salvation by faith and part by your own <br>
works is exactly the problem referred to in the Apocalypse as "Babylon", <br>
and many correctly identify entities such as the Roman church with Babylon. <br>
Much more sobering is how easily all of us can fall into the trap!<br>
Could you be an environmentalist and worship the beast? Sure. But I don't <br>
think that you can "remain faithful to Jesus" and "worship Him who made the <br>
heavens, the earth [and] the sea..." and *not* retain an environmental <br>
sensibility. It seems to me that we worry far too much about losing the <br>
distinctiveness of Adventism, and not nearly enough about being faithful to <br>
the Gospel. They aren't anywhere near incompatible considering the <br>
incredible breadth of perspective Adventism gives to the Christian life <br>
(sanctuary, health, death, liberty, etc.)<br>
On another point, it seems that the defenders of KJV and the Textus <br>
Receptus as the most accurate texts need to both lighten up and take some <br>
time looking at history and archaeology. The procedures used by the United <br>
Bible Society in their Greek New Testament which attempt to collate all <br>
mss., with understandable weight toward older sources seems a sound one. In <br>
addition to copious footnotes, they also produce a companion volume which <br>
explains why they chose certain readings, and leave the alternates well <br>
documented. I fail to see any "Jesuit" conspiricy unless you want to <br>
believe that they are out spiking the caves and have a lock on <br>
*interpreting* these manuscripts. Absurdities like this aside, it is <br>
wonderful to see the efforts of the wider scholastic community in forcing <br>
the hand of the few who have had a lock on *access* to some of the Dead Sea <br>
scroll materials.<br>
Until the more recent translations (NIV, NRSV, etc) became widely used in <br>
our churches it seemed that most of the pastors sermon time was taken up in <br>
explaining the Elizabethan language of the KJV into understandable terms. <br>
This wasn't always based on greek scholarship, either. To those of us with <br>
NIV's in our laps (or access to Greek texts), it was not time well spent. <br>
We wanted the preacher to get directly to the point about the text. IMHO, <br>
the quaint language of the KJV tends to make too many people view God the <br>
same way. Quaint and irrelevant.<br>
To paraphrase a famous LA resident, can we get on with it?<br>

One book which I have found interesting reading is<br>
<p>
Carson, D.A., "The KJV Debate: A Call For Realism", ...<br>
<p>
Carson is a well known Baptist writer/theologian who believes in verbal<br>
inspiration (qualification: he defines carefully what he means by "verbali<br>
inspiration before saying that), and he has written this book to counter<br>
certain elements in the evangelical community who were/are strongly pro<br>
TR and pro KJV. <br>
<p>
One interesting fact that I didn't previously know is that Erasmus was<br>
missing the last page of Revelation from his Greek original. He was hence<br>
forced to translate this passage back from the Vulgate latin into Greek for<br>
his printed version. He also chose to translate back for a few other passages<br>
where he was in doubt over the accuracy of his Greek manuscripts.<br>
<p>
The other thing was that the name "Textus Receptus" was taken from a short<br>
preface written by the two gents who prepared the Greek text from which the<br>
KJV was translated. The phrase seems to lend itself more intrinsic authority F<br>
than that, just from the way it sounds!<br>
<p>
And as for Catholic influence, Erasmus never actually left the RC church,<br>
although he pointedly disagreed with the Vulgate in many places.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So you see there has been tampering with the "textus receptus" by the </i><br>
<i>&gt; very same people Ruben accuses of tampering with the other versions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; We should be careful in choosing our points of defending the Word.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I urge those who are really interested in finding out the truth about<br>
the various translations to read "Our Authorised Bible Vindicated"<br>
by Benjamin G Wilkinson Ph.D.<br>
<p>
I really don't think that you can put the textus receptus on the same standing<br>
with codex B or codex aleph (from which the RSV and most of the new translations<br>
come)<br>
<p>
As to choosing our points in defending the Word the poroblem is that I do not<br>
have the time to go through and exaustively demonstrate the full truth of what <br>
I have briefly mentioned. The whole history of the various translations<br>
and of the translators is *very* worthwhile reading. <br>
<p>
Ruben.<br>
<p>
P.S I erred in my last post it is the Vaticanus manuscript not Vaticanicus<br>
as I had written. Sorry.<br>

I have followed with interest the discussion on Bible translations.  Let me<br>
offer a few comments.<br>
<p>
Bible translations fall into two general type.  The static translations attempt<br>
to render the underlying original languages in a more or less literal way. <br>
They tend to be word for word translations, as much as possible.  Those<br>
who look to the Bible to establish the technical details of their doctrines<br>
and those who employ the proof text method of Bible study generally<br>
prefer such translations.  Examples of this type include the Authorized<br>
Version (King James Version of 1611), the English Revised Version<br>
(1881), the American Standard Version (1901; essentially equals the<br>
modern New American Standard Bible), the Revised Standard Version<br>
(1946-52; to a lesser extent the New Revised Standard Version), and the<br>
New King James Version.  The more recent of these translations often<br>
make good study Bibles.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, the dynamic translations try to convey the meaning of<br>
the original languages at the level of ideas, often unpacking the meaning of<br>
ancient metaphors with modern equivalents.  Some see these translations as<br>
less accurate than their counterparts.  However, translation is rarely as<br>
simple or simplistic as a word for word enterprise.  Words work together<br>
in groups, like sentences and paragraphs, to convey meaning.  One can<br>
make a powerful case for extending the task of translation beyond the<br>
atomistic confines of words to the broader context of sentences and<br>
paragraphs, to the translation of ancient ideas and images into a modern<br>
setting.  Examples of this type include the New English Bible, Today's<br>
English Version (equals the Good News Bible), and, to some extent, the<br>
New International Version.  These translations make for good general<br>
reading.<br>
<p>
Some translations seem to fall somewhere in between these main types.<br>
<p>
Besides their approach to translation, the biblical versions also differ in<br>
another very important respect, the nature of their underlying texts.  From<br>
my perspective, this is more significant than the type of translation.<br>
<p>
For the Old Testament, before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls less<br>
than fifty years ago, the closest manuscripts to the original documents were<br>
prepared in the tenth century A.D.  With the Qumran and other<br>
manuscripts we have moved at least one thousand years closer to the<br>
originals.  Many of these documents exhibit a form of text that is<br>
unaffected by later editing and standardization.  No translation of the Old<br>
Testament before these discoveries can compare to those since in the<br>
quality of their underlying texts.<br>
<p>
While the situation with regard to the New Testament is less dramatic in<br>
the sense of newsworthiness, the results are no less significant.  Until the<br>
English Revised Version, translations of the New Testament were based on<br>
edited texts that traced their origin to the work of Erasmus in the early<br>
sixteenth century.  He based his texts on a few Medieval manuscripts. <br>
Even though his successors added the readings of many other late<br>
manuscripts, the essential nature of the text did not change.  This is the<br>
text that came to be known as the Textus Receptus, the Received or<br>
Standard Text.  Most specialists on the text of the New Testament consider<br>
this form of text to be not only late, but edited and standardized.  It shows<br>
clear signs of efforts to settle textual differences by compromise. <br>
Beginning in the nineteenth century with the discovery of some great<br>
manuscripts from the fourth and fifth centuries and continuing to the<br>
present with the steady find of even earlier and more primitive papyrus<br>
manuscripts, we now have available a wealth of New Testament textual<br>
material that brings us much closer to the original writings than was<br>
possible in the seventeenth century.  One fragment of the Gospel of John<br>
dates to within fifty years of the autograph!  I join the majority of students<br>
of the New Testament text in the view that some of these early<br>
manuscripts are not only closer in time to the original New Testament<br>
writings but are also more faithful to the original readings of these texts.<br>
<p>
Therefore, I feel that the most important criteria in judging the quality of a<br>
particular translation of the Bible is the nature of its underlying original<br>
texts for both the Old Testament and the New Testament.  Accordingly, I<br>
would consider as superior in this regard only those translations which are<br>
based on the best available texts and that positively reflect the current state<br>
of Old and New Testament textual studies.  For me, this would not include<br>
any translation made before the last half of the present century.<br>
<p>
Let me say a few words about the Authorized Version.  First of all, I<br>
acknowledge the important role that this translation has played in the<br>
history of the English language, in the life of the Church, and in the<br>
experiences of countless Christians.  It is truly a classic.  However,  one<br>
should recognize that it was far from the first translation in English and<br>
that it did not receive immediate acceptance.  It was based on late Hebrew<br>
texts for the Old Testament and the flawed Textus Receptus for the New<br>
Testament.  Incidently, the same texts lie behind the New King James<br>
Version, which has been merely rendered in a more modern form of the<br>
language.  While, for me, this is sufficient to disqualify the AV (KJV) as<br>
the translation of choice, the decision is strengthened by its antiquated<br>
vocabulary and its old grammatical characteristics.  Notable among the<br>
latter are the ancient forms of verbs and the use of the second person<br>
singular pronouns, e.g., "thou."<br>
<p>
God did not inspire the biblical writers to produce a classic or a document<br>
with a special celestial language.  The Bible was written in the<br>
contemporary language of ancient common people and was intended to be<br>
understood by them.  It can best convey its message to us if we have it in<br>
a form that is not only as true as possible to the original but also as clear<br>
as possible in our contemporary language.<br>

Given Ruben's comments on the state of affairs here in Australia, I feel<br>
myself fortunate to have grown up as a missionaries' child in other Pacific<br>
countries (specifically New Zealand and Papua New Guinea). I also feel<br>
blessed to have had parents who made it their responsibility to teach me<br>
about God and about the Adventist church, incdluding SDA church history<br>
and distinctive beliefs.<br>
<p>
It seems remarkable that so many Adventist ministers and parents are<br>
shirking their God-given responsibility here in Australia, if what Ruben<br>
says is indeed the case. Are there any other net readers who are familiar<br>
with the Australian branch of the church who would be prepared to offer an<br>
opinion on this?<br>

I first heard this model explained when I was a student of S. Clark Rowland<br>
(a silent member of SDAnet).  Recently he wrote it up and put it in the <br>
National Association of Adventist Physicists Newsletter.  I present it here<br>
with his permission, as he wrote it up.  He expressed the concern that this <br>
model ought not to become the new orthodoxy.  I replied that nothing I have<br>
said on this net so far has become new orthodoxy, and that there is no reason<br>
to think that this statement will be so accepted.  Without further ado...<br>
<p>
Science and Faith--The Interface   (From N.A.A.P.)<br>
 "An 'Impossible' Model" by S. Clark Rowland<br>
<p>
I have heard it said, within SDA church circles, that it is impossible to come <br>
up with a model which is totally consistent with both the best scientific<br>
data and our traditional understanding of earth origins.  Any time someone<br>
expresses such an opinion, it becomes a challenge.  To show that such is <br>
indeed possible, I present the _Spaceship Eden_ model.<br>
<p>
The complete traditional understanding of creation week is assumed.  Adam <br>
has been named as the representative of this earth on the heavenly council.<br>
The Creator calls a meeting to introduce him to the other members.  Since<br>
it is a significant trip, he is instructed to take Eve with him.  Of course<br>
they need a vehicle in which to make the trip.  It is commonly held in SDA<br>
circles that the Garden of Eden was transported to heaven at the time of Noah's<br>
flood so, being transportable, we assume that the Garden of Eden was used as a<br>
spaceship to transport Adam and Eve to a meeting of the heavenly council<br>
soon after the creation week.  Not knowing where the council meeting may <br>
have been held, we assume that it was perhaps one tenth of the distance across<br>
the universe and that they travel at speeds approaching the speed of light.  <br>
We then assume that the meeting took place, lasting perhaps a couple of weeks.<br>
During the meeting, all representatives are able to tour the Garden of Eden<br>
and meet Adam and Eve.  At the end of the meeting, _Spaceship Eden_ takes<br>
off for the return trip to earth.  <br>
<p>
Meanwhile back on earth, at least a few microbes have been left around the <br>
perimeter of the garden when it was removed.  With this raw material,<br>
the devil began an intensive genetic engineering program immediately upon<br>
their departure.  In time he was amazingly successful.  Due to time dilation,<br>
a short trip of a few months in Spaceship Eden would correspond to a time<br>
period on earth of a few billion years.<br>
<p>
Upon the arrival of Spaceship Eden back on earth, Adam and Eve find that the <br>
flora and fauna on the earth is a reasonable approximation to that in the <br>
garden.  Some time passes and the fall takes place.  For Adam and Eve, the time<br>
from creation to the fall would have been very short, perhaps a few months. <br>
On the earth that same time interval would have been several billion years.<br>
<p>
I concluded that I had done what had been said to be impossible. The one<br>
who had said it agreed.  He then asked, "Why don't you publish it?"  My<br>
response was, "Because I don't want it to become the new orthodoxy."  It<br>
had been my intention not to describe how events transpired but rather <br>
to demonstrate that acceptance of the best scientific models in no way<br>
threatens faith.  If it is this easy to construct a model which is consistent<br>
with both the most literal theological traditions concerning origins <br>
and with the best scientific understanding of origins, then we have no <br>
reason to be fearful of innovative model building.  It is unlikely that <br>
a definitive model will ever be produced but the door is open for <br>
creative expression.<br>

			    Bible Versions<br>
<p>
	This recent discussion on Bible versions has been very<br>
interesting to me.  I read Wilkinson's books about the Bible versions<br>
and some other books and a friend of mine studied this further.  The<br>
situation is that 90% of the manuscripts follow the Textus Receptus<br>
(on which KJV is based) and 10% or less the Vaticanus (or whatever it<br>
is called).  It's true that the Vaticanus etc. are older.  However,<br>
since the Receptus texts are more numerous and widely distributed,<br>
it's reasonable to suppose that they come from an earlier source.<br>
There's no good evidence for some kind of standardization among them.<br>
The texts that were most heavily used tended to wear out faster; those<br>
that remained were those that were less used.<br>
<p>
	We do have some evidence of very early texts; some of these<br>
come from quotes in the early church fathers.  These quotes sometimes<br>
follow the Textus Receptus and sometimes not, as far as I have<br>
learned.  So this shows that the Receptus was not a late invention.<br>
Also, the early Bible fragments that have been found, contain mixtures<br>
of the Receptus and the other version (Vaticanus?).  So there's no<br>
clear evidence that one version is older than the other based on the<br>
age of the manuscripts alone.<br>
<p>
	Now, who were all these people who wrote those Receptus<br>
manuscripts?  It wasn't the Roman Catholics, because they favored the<br>
Vaticanus and related versions.  The preponderance of the Receptus<br>
versions tells us some very significant things about the history of<br>
Christianity.  It shows that there was an active and widely<br>
distributed community of Christians who were dedicated to the<br>
Scriptures and not affiliated with the Roman Catholic church.  They<br>
were also very influential, because my understanding is that some of<br>
these Receptus texts were from royal families.  This shows that there<br>
was a separate stream of Christianity from earliest times unaffiliated<br>
with Roman Catholicism.<br>
<p>
	Why don't we know more about these people?  The early<br>
Protestants mentioned that after every persecution, the Roman church<br>
did all it could to destroy the manuscripts of those they persecuted,<br>
especially their Bible manuscripts.  That might say something about<br>
why it's harder to find older Textus Receptus manuscripts.  The Great<br>
Controversy also mentions this, about the fact that few records remain<br>
of the true history of Christianity.<br>
<p>
	So how did the text become changed?  Well, from now on, it's<br>
mostly speculation.  But there was a considerable Gnostic influence in<br>
early Christianity.  They tended to deny the deity of Christ, I am<br>
told.  (And the importance of the law?)  The Vaticanus and related<br>
versions tend to minimize the texts dealing with the divine nature of<br>
Christ, as you can verify by comparison.  Apparently the Gnostics were<br>
very powerful and in order to win their support the Roman Catholic<br>
church incorporated their manuscripts.  I suppose the very early<br>
manuscripts represented an intermediate stage when the Gnostic<br>
influence was only beginning to be felt and so you have a mixture of<br>
the true and the false.  This paragraph is largely based on what my<br>
friend told me, who researched this part of the story some.<br>
<p>
	I would also mention that Ellen White strongly supports texts<br>
like ``Blessed are they that do his commandments'' that are rendered<br>
in the modern versions as ``Blessed are those who have washed their<br>
robes.''  (Rev. 22:14) At least, that is my impression.<br>
<p>
	Of course, the two versions are really not very different.<br>
But, when it comes to the Word of God, even a small change is<br>
significant.<br>
<p>

I can think of two other sources to look at in discussing Daniel 9.  There<br>
is an article in the third volume of the Daniel and Revelation Committe<br>
series.  I was going to bring it the lab today but forgot.  There is also<br>
an article in AAndrews Universtiy Seminary Studies.  I will try to post<br>
more information later.  Ian. <br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
<p>
	Let me say that Sherman's quote of mine regarding the Australian<br>
situation was not meant for public dissemination. It was in a private<br>
email message to Sherman.<br>
<p>
I realise Sherman mistook my private message as being an SDAnet message<br>
which does occur sometimes and therefore replied publicly. <br>
<p>
However now that it has been published, let me just qualify it by saying<br>
that I do not wish to imply that *all* the youth are like this. Neither was<br>
I reflecting either directly nor indirectly on the Australian contributors<br>
to SDAnet, since I don't believe they fall into this category. However it<br>
is my sad oppinion that the majority of SDA youth that I do personally know<br>
(and are not subscribers to SDAnet) are this way. <br>
<p>
To attempt to qualify this I'm not sure what the exact numbers are (70% ?)<br>
[ help me out here if the figure is wrong ]<br>
but most of the SDA youth leave the church just after graduating from<br>
high school. From my very own class at high school I would say that<br>
most no longer attend church, in fact the church membership in Sydney<br>
is actually decreasing, if one does not consider the stabilising effect<br>
of the ethinc work. In fact I am deeply concerned regarding the future of the <br>
church here in Sydney because of this very problem.<br>
<p>
I appologise if any were led to a wrong conclusion, or if this issue caused any<br>
to receive a wrong impression regarding any Australian contributors to SDAnet.<br>
<p>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Ruben.<br>

I have been quite surprised to see the groundswell of support for the <br>
King James Version.  I have seen arguments from other fundamentalist<br>
groups on the net with much less sophisticated logic, but never heard<br>
such arguments from the mouth of Adventists before.  At the same time,<br>
I suppose I have asked for the comments since I have been at least as vocal.<br>
This leads me to ask--why is this question so important to me?  (all long-<br>
term readers of SDAnet know this is a subject near and dear to my heart<br>
that comes up frequently.)<br>
<p>
Would my faith be different if the following verses were not in my Bible?<br>
John 15:4<br>
Mark 16:9-20<br>
<p>
Would my faith be different if the following books and chapters were in my <br>
Bible?   (In my N.R.S.V. they are)<br>
<p>
Daniel 13-15<br>
Wisdom of Solomon<br>
Baruch<br>
Sirach<br>
<p>
To me, unless I wish to postulate the infallibility of the Bible because<br>
I intend to use it as a rhetorical club, it should not matter if John 15:4<br>
is in my Bible or not.  Having said this, I pull out my own favorite <br>
rhetorical club, Selected Messages Vol. 1, and give some advice.<br>
<p>
pg. 16<br>
"Some look to us gravely, and say 'Don't you think there might have <br>
been some mistake in the copyist or the translators?"  This is all <br>
probable, and the mind that is so narrow that it will hesitate and <br>
stumble over this possibility or probability would be just as ready to <br>
stumble over the mysteries of the Inspired Word, because their feeble<br>
minds cannot see through the purposes of God."<br>
<p>
pg. 17<br>
When men, in their finite judgment, find it necessary to go into an <br>
examinatio of scriptures to define that which is inspired and that which<br>
is not, they have stepped before Jesus to show Him a better way than He<br>
has led us......<br>
<p>
    Men should let God take care of His own Book, His living oracles, <br>
as He has done for ages.   ...<br>
<p>
pg. 20<br>
There is not always perfect order or apparent unity in the scriptures.<br>
The miracles of Christ are not given by exact order, but are given,<br>
just as the circumstances occurred, which called for this divine revealing<br>
of the power of Christ.<br>
<p>
pg. 21 <br>
<p>
It is not the words of the Bible that were inspired, but the men that <br>
were inspired.  Inspiration acts not on the man's words or his expressions<br>
but on the man himself.<br>
<p>
<p>
----------<br>
I discuss this topic, not because I have any particular version to push,<br>
but because I feel that the attitude towards inspiration is the main <br>
divisive factor in the church today.  Liberals, conservatives, and fence-<br>
sitters all can misunderstand it, and we need to start talking while we <br>
can still at least understand each other's terms.  I don't expect everyone<br>
to view inspiration like I do.  If people need to believe in a verbally-<br>
inspired Bible to have any faith at all, I don't want to shake their faith.<br>
<p>
To our defenders of the KJV:  In the light of the statements above, <br>
what is the reason to defend the "textus receptus?"  David Plaisted has<br>
mentioned one possible doctrinal error, Rev 22:14, are there others<br>
we should be aware of?  Could it be that if we draw the line at defending<br>
the literal and legal truth of the Bible, some people will never learn<br>
the spiritual truth by experiencing it and living it.  After all, the Bible<br>
is not true because a set of letters have been preserved on paper for lo<br>
these 2000 years.  It's true in the greatest sense because its teachings<br>
lead to the way of salvation.<br>
<p>
As a postscript, I believe that we're going to find out that a lot more <br>
about the Bible was true and inspired than we ever thought could be.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;.....</i><br>
<i>&gt; Until the</i><br>
<i>&gt; English Revised Version, translations of the New Testament were based on</i><br>
<i>&gt; edited texts that traced their origin to the work of Erasmus in the early</i><br>
<i>&gt; sixteenth century.  He based his texts on a few Medieval manuscripts. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even though his successors added the readings of many other late</i><br>
<i>&gt; manuscripts, the essential nature of the text did not change.  This is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; text that came to be known as the Textus Receptus, the Received or</i><br>
<i>&gt; Standard Text</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Can you provide evidence of this fact. I have evidence directly to the contrary.<br>
I was going to bring it in today but I unfortunately left it at home.<br>
<p>
The Textus receptus did not originate with Erasmus, its lineage can be traced<br>
back through the Waldenisan bible to earliest times. Neither was Erasmus's<br>
edition based on just a *few* Medieval manuscripts. Please substantiate<br>
this claim.<br>
<p>
There is ample evidence to prove that Erasmus had at hand and was aware<br>
of *ALL* the variant readings which were introduced by Codex B (Vaticanus)<br>
and the Siniaticus.  <br>
<p>
In fact the revised version itself was based on heavily edited texts<br>
and on some of questionable character. Not to mention that most of<br>
the revised version was exclusively translated from just codex B completely<br>
ignoring the weight of evidence which lies against many of its errors.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Most specialists on the text of the New Testament consider</i><br>
<i>&gt; this form of text to be not only late, but edited and standardized.  It shows</i><br>
<i>&gt; clear signs of efforts to settle textual differences by compromise.</i><br>
<p>
please substantiate this claim, who are these specialists ?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Beginning in the nineteenth century with the discovery of some great</i><br>
<i>&gt; manuscripts from the fourth and fifth centuries and continuing to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; present with the steady find of even earlier and more primitive papyrus</i><br>
<i>&gt; manuscripts, we now have available a wealth of New Testament textual</i><br>
<i>&gt; material that brings us much closer to the original writings than was</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible in the seventeenth century. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
By this you refer to the vaticanus and the Sinitaticus MSS which as I have<br>
mentioned originate from Constatine and the gnostic philosopher Origen.<br>
Which belong to the same family as the Latin Vulgate. By which I mean<br>
that they contain exactly the same errors. In fact as I have mentioned they<br>
bring us not closer to the original material, but rather remove us further<br>
away from it due to its origin. Again I state that *all* of the variant<br>
readings found in these two MSS were available to Erasmus and he rejected<br>
them. The tranlators of the AV were also agare of these MSS and rejected<br>
them also. The AV is the bible of the reformation, it is this bible that incited<br>
the hatred and opposition of the RCC not the other translations based<br>
on the Vulgate and its derivatives. I wonder why ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I join the majority of students</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the New Testament text in the view that some of these early</i><br>
<i>&gt; manuscripts are not only closer in time to the original New Testament</i><br>
<i>&gt; writings but are also more faithful to the original readings of these texts.</i><br>
<p>
How can you verify this, do you have the original texts by which to make<br>
this judgement ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is truly a classic.  However,  one</i><br>
<i>&gt; should recognize that it was far from the first translation in English and</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it did not receive immediate acceptance. </i><br>
<p>
What do you mean by this ? How do you judge acceptance? By whom was it not<br>
immediately accepted ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It was based on late Hebrew</i><br>
<i>&gt;texts for the Old Testament and the flawed Textus Receptus for the New</i><br>
<i>&gt; Testament.                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</i><br>
<p>
Please substantiate this statement. If you can not please withdraw it.<br>
<p>
<p>
Ruben.<br>

First a response to some of Ruben's points, then some of my own.<br>
Ruben asked in his post for a flaw in the "Textus Receptus".  I have<br>
already documented one, namely the added phrase in 1 John 5:8.<br>
<p>
Ruben also claims the AV to be the "Bible of the Reformation."  This<br>
is substantially untrue.  The Authorized Version, or "King James Version"<br>
as Americans know it, was promulgated in 1611.  By this time most of the<br>
great reformers such as Luther, Tyndale, Coverdale, and Calvin were<br>
already dead.  The Authorized Version was produced at the behest of the <br>
king and enjoyed the blessing of the Crown save during the reign<br>
of James the II, a Catholic.  At the time of James I, the Church of <br>
England was already under fire from the Puritans from being too papal.<br>
<p>
Now, a word in defense of the Textus Receptus and the Authorized Version<br>
(which after all, I myself frequently use.)  The story in the gospel of <br>
John of the woman taken in adultery appears as a footnote in some modern<br>
translations because some of the manuscripts Ruben has been railing against<br>
do not include it.  But in recent years writings of early church fathers<br>
have been found that refer to the story.  These writings suggest that <br>
the story was removed from some copies of the manuscript because the church<br>
fathers feared that it would encourage adultery and fornication.<br>
So here we have at least one case where the TR and AV prevail against <br>
the modernists.<br>
<p>
Has anyone heard more about the fragments 7Q4 and 7Q5 from the Qumran<br>
caves, dated AD60 or earlier, that some scholars allege to have New <br>
Testament fragments in their markings?<br>
<p>

[from Ruben Gonzales]<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First a response to some of Ruben's points, then some of my own.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ruben asked in his post for a flaw in the "Textus Receptus".  I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; already documented one, namely the added phrase in 1 John 5:8.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Could you give me the source of this information regarding this, I would<br>
really like to follow it up.<br>
[I found this in Alden Thompson's book _Inspiration_.  SCT]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ruben also claims the AV to be the "Bible of the Reformation."  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; is substantially untrue.  The Authorized Version, or "King James Version"</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, my mistake, I meant the Textus receptus (not the AV) was the bible<br>
of the reformation. To the extent that Calvin, Luther etc used it the the<br>
exclusion of all other versions.<br>
<p>
<p>

I wasn't exposed much to the KJV as a child since I grew up in South America.  <br>
We had the debate about whether to use the Reina y Valera that Ruben mentioned, <br>
or the 1960 revision thereof.  Well, the original dates from 1569 and was <br>
revised by Valera in 1602, so you can imagine that the language is of the same <br>
style as the KJV.  Adventists in Argentina didn't seem to have much problem <br>
with accepting the revision.  They understood that the new version was easier <br>
to understand and that the younger generation now had an alternative.  Many of <br>
the older generation kept using the original because of habit and feeling <br>
comfortable with the words.<br>
<p>
A note to Ruben.  The Reina y Valera you find so accurate is a Catholic <br>
translation.  Not until the 1960 version sponsored by the International Bible <br>
Society did protestants have much say other than in leaving out the Apocrypha <br>
in their printings.<br>
<p>
I become concerned when we start making sweeping generalizations, or trying to <br>
make everything cut and dried.  Jesuits are not hiding under every bed, nor <br>
taking over the seminary--I should know, my dad is the Dean.  It is time that <br>
we all remembered that knowledge is best acquired first hand.  I would not call <br>
myself a scientist if I accepted what others say without checking it out <br>
myself, going to the sources, comparing other data, etc.  The same is true for <br>
the Bible.  Read as many versions as you can get your hands on, in as many <br>
languages as you are able.  You will multiply the ways the Word can reach your <br>
mind and heart, and the Holy Spirit will guide your understanding.<br>
<p>
Having given my pedigree, please let me add another warning.  Just because <br>
something purports to come from the Seminary doesn't necessarily make it an <br>
official communique, nor the truth.  Just as in any other academic institution, <br>
the faculty at the Seminary have their differences of opinion--sometimes <br>
marked.  They publish and present in different forums and sometimes debate each <br>
other verbally or in writing.  Until someone can show me that appointment to <br>
the seminary faculty endows one with the gift of prophecy, I will take what I <br>
hear and check it out in the Bible.<br>
<p>
On another topic entirely.  The abortion debate seems to be waning, and I do <br>
not mean to start another round of discussion in which people who already know <br>
what they think try to convince other people of equally fixed opinions.  My <br>
concern is this:  what are we doing as individuals and as a church to make <br>
abortion unnecessary?  What about the physical, financial, emotional support of <br>
the women/families with unplanned pregnancies?  What about family planning?  <br>
You see, I work as a nurse-midwife at a teen clinic.  We don't do abortions, <br>
but I provide family planning and prenatal care (among a lot of other things) <br>
to poor minority and-- oh dear!--unmarried teens.  I think that as SDA's we're <br>
so uncomfortable with the idea of non-marital sex that we don't even want to <br>
touch the issue, but we need to address it.  Some of the kids turning up in my <br>
clinic are SDA's.<br>
<p>
Ideas about practical christianity much appreciated.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
Its time to supply the facts.<br>
<p>
Now Steve wrote from A.Thompsons book _Inspiration_<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In the compilation of that work, Erasmus noted that 1 John 5:8 as translated</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the Vulgate had an addition which did not appear in the Greek manuscripts:</i><br>
<p>
Which are these Greek MSS in which this did not appear ? Could you identify<br>
them for me please.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The part between the asterisks evidently was added quite some time later.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Erasmus did not want to include it, but the Church fathers insisted that</i><br>
<i>&gt; he should.  </i><br>
<p>
Which church fathers are these, most of them died around 1000 years before<br>
Erasmus. I would really like to sus this one out.<br>
<p>
Let me just say that there is ample evidence to show that the Jesuits attempted <br>
at every turn to corrupt Erasmus's writings, his letters and his books, by <br>
changing or forging or destroying them. [Froude, Life of Erasmus, pp271,272]<br>
Whether this is the situation with regard to the above episode or not may<br>
not be so easy to tell.<br>
<p>
At any rate we all know and accept that Erasmus' text has some errors. No one<br>
will dispute that the point is that Erasmus text corrected the errors of the<br>
previous versions and both he and his scholarship was endorsed by EGW.<br>
<p>
All of the modern translations contain the very errors that Erasmus corrected<br>
according to EGW, because they are mainly based on just two MSS which come<br>
directly from the RCC and Constantine and are of the same family as the LAtin<br>
Vulgate. The Textus receptus which Erasmus published was not the fruit of his <br>
own hands, it was the dominant and principle text at the time and had<br>
been since at least 350AD. It was the same text as treasured by the Waldenisans<br>
(which EGW tells us was pure, uncontaminated and came directly from the apostles), it was the same MSS treasured by the Copitcs and the Greek Church<br>
for over 1000 years. And it is the one verified by the church fathers themselves<br>
<p>
REv 22:14 church fathers quote - "do His commandments"<br>
Tertullian (AD200) Cyprian (248-258) and Tertonius (390) first time <br>
wash robes is quoted is by Athanasius, bishop of alexandria (326-373)<br>
so the textus receptus reading predates even the earliest manuscripts.<br>
<p>
Another tradition of texts - the eastern texts (Syriac) in Aramaic the language <br>
most of the NT was spoken in. these texts generally confer with<br>
the Textus receptus as also does the Coptic version, in fact Even the Vatican <br>
manuscript in Greek has rev 22:14 as per the KJV.<br>
<p>
The traditional text (Textus Receptus) held sway in the Greek church from about <br>
312-1453 AD.<br>
<p>
Dr.F.C. Cook (Chapilan to the Queen of England, who was invited to sit on the re<br>
vision committe, but refused) has this to say regarding the translation of hte <br>
KJV.<br>
<p>
"That textus receptus was taken in the first instance, from late cursive <br>
manuscripts; but its readings are maintained only so far as they agree with<br>
the earliest and best Greek and Latin Fathers, and with the vast majority of <br>
unical and cursive manuscipts." Revised Version of the first three Gospels, p226.<br>
<p>
The cursive MSS were those written in a cursive style and typically date<br>
later than the unical ones which were written in capital letters.<br>
<p>
Lets see the verdict of the RCC regarding these and other versions.<br>
Dr. Kenrick, Catholic Bishop of Philadelphia says in his preface to an English <br>
translation of a catholic bible in 1849<br>
"Since the famous manuscripts of Rome Alexandria, Cambridge, Paris and Dublin <br>
were examined...A verdict has been obtained in favor of the Vulgate. At the <br>
reformation the Greek text as it then stood, was taken as a standard, in <br>
conformity to which the versions of the reformers were generally made; whilst <br>
the LAtin Vulgate was depreciated, or dispised as a mere version."<br>
<p>
Now we see why men prefer the other manuscipts because they support the Vulgate.<br>
<p>
<p>
That Erasmus was aware of the variant readings of the Vaticanus (codex B) we <br>
read.<br>
<p>
"A correspondent of Erasmus in 1533 sent that scholar a number of selected <br>
readings from it (Codex B) as proof of its superiority over the Received Greek <br>
Text" Sir Fredrick Kenyon, "Our Bible" p133. <br>
<p>
This correspondent was none other than Professor Paulus Bombasius at Rome. <br>
[S.P. Tregelles, On the printed Text of the Greek test., p.22]<br>
<p>
{Sorry for stealing your `[` Steve }<br>
<p>
One can not claim that these "older and more reliable" texts were unknown<br>
to either ERasmus or the KJV translators, they knew them, and rejected them<br>
as corrupt.<br>
<p>
What matters anyway, the vast majority of the manuscipts in Greek are <br>
practically all the Recieved Text. The Textus Receptus did not originate with <br>
Erasmus all he practically did was publish it and make it accessable<br>
<p>
Dean Burgon an eminent authority says<br>
"The one great FACT, which especially troubles him, (Dr, Hort), and his joint <br>
Editor, -(as well it may)- is the traditional Greek text of the New Testament <br>
Scriptures. Call this text Erasmian or Complutensian., --the Text of Stephens, <br>
or of Beza, or of Elzevirs, -- call it the 'Received', or the traditional Greek <br>
text, or what ever other name you please; --the fact remains, that a text has <br>
come down to us which is attested by a general consensus of ancient copics, <br>
ancient fathers, ancient versions... Our readers cannot have yet forgotten his <br>
(Dr Hort's) virtual admission, that beyond all question the Textus Receptus is <br>
the dominant Graeco-Syrian Text of A.D. 350 to A.D. 400." in Revision Revised, <br>
p.269.<br>
<p>
And mind you Hort hated the Textus REceptus he wrote <br>
"Think of that vile textus receptus" Life of Hort Vol1, p214.<br>
<p>
<p>
"The popular notion seems to be, that we are indebted for our knowledge of the <br>
true texts of scripture to the existing unicial entirely; and that the essence <br>
of the secret dwells exclusively with the four or five oldest of those uncials. <br>
By consequence, it is popularly supposed that since we are possessed of such <br>
uncial copies, we could afford to dispense with the testimony of the cursives <br>
altogether. A more complete misconception of the facts of the case can hardly <br>
be imagined. For the plain truth is THAT ALL THE PHENOMENA EXHIBITED BY THE <br>
UNICAL MANUSCRIPTS ARE reproduced by the cursive copies." [emph. mine] Burgon <br>
and Miller, "The Traditional Text" p.202.<br>
<p>
Dr. Sdrivener says regarding this<br>
"A Judge is not impartial if he rejects the testimony of eighty-nine out of a <br>
hundred witnesses. It is a law of evidence that the very few are to be suspected<br>
 rather than the very many." "Bibliotheca Sacra" p.35<br>
<p>
Sidney  Collett in his "The Scripture of Truth" when writing about the Siniatic <br>
manuscript that was found by Dr. Tischendorf stated :-<br>
"Dr. Tischendorf believed that this and the Vatican manusicrpt were two of the <br>
fifty copies of the Bible which were made in Greek by command<br>
of emperor Constantine about hte year AD 331, under the supervision of Bishop <br>
Eusebius, the historian of Ceasarea,." p.28<br>
<p>
There is a host of authorities which share the conviction regarding the <br>
origin of these two MSS.<br>
Eusebius was a disciple of Origen and these texts were largely the result<br>
of ORigens work. Its is from the version of Eusebius that Jerome produced<br>
the Vulgate.<br>
<p>
Origens view of scripture was "The scriptures are of little use to those who<br>
understand them as they are written" McClintock and Strong, _Origen_<br>
everyone knowns that Origen was infactuated with Greek philosophy and Plato.<br>
<p>
Abbo Martin, a well known CAtholic textual critic claims that the Vaticanus and <br>
the Siniaticus were "fabricated" by Origen and others. (see Schaff, "Companion <br>
to the Greek Text")<br>
<p>
<p>
How can anybody knowing that any bible Translated from RCC MSS wilfuly endorse<br>
them as being superior. Both of the MSS used to the exclusion of all others<br>
in the translation of all modern bibles (NIV,RSV,NEB etc) use these two texts <br>
both of which were found on Roman Catholic property. how very fitting.<br>
<p>
Let me just give you some facts about these two manuscripts :<br>
<p>
Facts about he Vaticanus<br>
<p>
it omits 	Gen 1:1 to Gen 46:28<br>
		Ps 106 to Ps 138<br>
		Matt 16:2-3<br>
		Heb 9:14-13:25<br>
		All of Revelation<br>
It leaves out of the gospels :<br>
		237 words<br>
		452 clauses<br>
		748 whole sentences<br>
(2556 omissions in all)<br>
That these appear to be oversights of the scribe is evident from the fact that <br>
the "same scribe has repeatedly written words and clauses twice over" <br>
(Dr. Scrivener, "Introduction", Vol.1, p.120) Obiously this piece of <br>
writing was not considered to be of major importance unlike the textus<br>
receptus which was painstakingly copied and verified.<br>
Dr. Hskier says " That B (Codex B = Vaticanus) is guilty of latches, of a <br>
tendancy to 'improve,' and of 'sunstroke' amounting to doctrinal bias. That <br>
maligned Textus Receptus served in large measure as the base which B. tampered <br>
with and changed, and that the Church at larrge recognised all this until the <br>
year 1881 -- when Hortism, in other words Alexandrianis,, was allowd free play" "Codex B and Its Allies", part 1, p.465/<br>
It contains the Apocrypha and such is completely Roman Catholic<br>
It was available to the translators of the KJV but they refused to use<br>
it because it was unreliable and contrary to the bulk of evidence.<br>
<p>
In fact I can go throught the NIV comparing it to the Douay (Vulgate)<br>
and show where it differs from the KJV is does so to agree with the Vulgate, in fact it parallels it. This bible and all those based on it lead stright<br>
to Rome. Instead of using the bible the SoP endorses as fixing the errors<br>
in the Vulgate we may as well go and use the Vulgate directly because<br>
that is what the Vaticanus is.<br>
<p>
<p>
Facts about the Siniaticus<br>
<p>
it contains almost all of the N.T. but added to it is the "Shepherd of Hermes",<br>
"Bel and the Dragon", and the Epistle of Barnabas" (which I think has been shown<br>
 to be a forgery). It has been heavily altered, changes "brought in by at least <br>
ten different revisers....the greater part belonging to the sixth or seventh <br>
century.." Dr. Scrivener "A Full Collation of the Codex Siniaticus," p.XIX, <br>
Introduction<br>
<p>
Mr Philip Mauro adds " Thus there are internal evidences that lead to the <br>
conclusion that it was the work of a scribe who was singularly carless, or <br>
incompetent or both..." Which Version" p.45<br>
<p>
It appears to be very unreliable and is deemed so by many authorities.<br>
<p>
Why is it that the editors of the NIV and these other bibles and those who<br>
push them on the people don't tell them of these facts.<br>
<p>
Just so you can get an idea of the quality of these "most reliable and oldest<br>
texts" I want to quote to you a litte from them found in the Epistle of Barnabus<br>
<p>
"But he adds neither shalt thou eat the hare. To what end? To signify this to<br>
us: thou shalt not be an adulterer; nor liken thyself to such persons. For the<br>
hare every year multiplies the places of its conception; and so many years it <br>
lives, so many it has. Neither shalt thou eat of the hyena; that is again, be<br>
not an adulterer, nor a corrupter of others; neither be like such. And wherefore<br>
so ? Because creature every year changes its kind and is sometimes male and <br>
sometimes female." Epist. Barnabus 8:7-8<br>
<p>
What utter garbage, and this is what those two "most reliable and oldest <br>
manuscripts contain. They don't seem to be so reliable to me.<br>
<p>
Another example the NIV leaves out MArk 16:9-20 on the evidence of these<br>
two MSS however every single other unical MSS contains these verses except<br>
these two Catholic manuscripts. How much evidence does one need.<br>
<p>
Dean Burton says "The impurity of the TExts exhibited by Codices B and Aleph is <br>
not a matter of opinion, but a matter of fact. These are two of the least <br>
trustworthy documents in existence" Revision Revised pp315<br>
<p>
Both MSS are well preserved and little used, obviously indicating  the little <br>
confidence with which they were held.<br>
<p>
The NIV just like the RSV are almost singularily based on the Vaticanus and the <br>
Sinitaticus.<br>
<p>
<p>
Just a few more notes :<br>
<p>
"Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you neither shall ye diminish<br>
from it." Deut 4:2<br>
<p>
"And if any man shall take away from the words of the book or this prophecy,<br>
God shall take away his part out of the book of life" Rev 22:19<br>
<p>
"Every word of God is pure and is a shield unto them that put their trust in <br>
Him"  Prov 30:5<br>
<p>
"Man shall not live by bread alone but by *every* word of God." Luke 4:4<br>
<p>
Here are some of the Verses omited by the NIV based on the Vaticanus text<br>
ignoring all the evidence to the contrary.<br>
<p>
matt 18:11<br>
matt 17:21<br>
matt 23:14<br>
mark 7:16<br>
mark 9:44<br>
mark 9:46<br>
mark 11:26<br>
mark 15:28<br>
luke 17:36<br>
luke 23:17<br>
john 5:3,4<br>
acts 8:37<br>
acts 15:34<br>
acts 24:7<br>
acts 28:29<br>
Rom 16:24<br>
<p>
It is interesting to note that all of these modern bibles are copyrighted.<br>
What does a copyright mean ?<br>
<p>
"The legal protection given to authors and artists to prevent reproduction of <br>
their work without their consent. The owner of a copyright has the exclusive <br>
rith to print, repaint, publish, copy and sell the materical covered by the <br>
copyright."<br>
<p>
<p>
All these bibles self-condem themselves because as the copyright says, it is<br>
a mans work and it belongs to man.<br>
<p>
Now how does that go for God's Word, God's word is not copyrightable, <br>
copyrighted bibles by their own admission are not God's Word but mans word.<br>
<p>
2 Tim 2:9 "Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but *the <br>
Word of God is not bound*"<br>
<p>
Gods word is not bound by any copyright, if it were bound it would'nt be<br>
God's Word, would it ?<br>
<p>
The issue is not whether the Textus Receptus has a few errors (which are minor<br>
in comparison with those of all other translations). The issue is whether<br>
or not we are to use the manufactured and corrupted Catholic manuscipts<br>
or whether to use the text preserved by the church in the wilderness in its<br>
purity. Which do not lead back the RCC though the smooth waters of <br>
ecumenicalism as the others do.<br>
<p>
And this is only a little of the matterial I have.<br>
<p>

I'm curious about one comment Ruben made:<br>
<p>
"It is interesting to note that all of these modern bibles are copyrighted.<br>
What does a copyright mean ?<br>
<p>
"The legal protection given to authors and artists to prevent reproduction of<br>
their work without their consent. The owner of a copyright has the exclusive<br>
rith to print, repaint, publish, copy and sell the materical covered by the<br>
copyright."<br>
<p>
<p>
All these bibles self-condem themselves because as the copyright says, it is<br>
a mans work and it belongs to man.<br>
<p>
Now how does that go for God's Word, God's word is not copyrightable,<br>
copyrighted bibles by their own admission are not God's Word but mans word.<br>
"<br>
<p>
That's a very interesting comment for you must infer then that all of EGW's<br>
writings are also "man's word" because they were copyrighted.<br>
<p>
I have to disagree that copyright per se means that the work is not the<br>
Word of God.  We need to very careful with these comments.  If an translator<br>
did not copyright does that means he/she professes their work to be God's<br>
word?<br>

On the Text of the New Testament<br>
<p>
One thing that puzzles me about the current discussion is the authorities cited.  I have yet to<br>
see the name of a scholar who is generally considered to be a first order authority on New<br>
Testament textual criticism.  (Lest anyone get excited about the word "criticism," it simply<br>
means "rigorous analysis.")  While I would certainly not classify myself among such<br>
luminaries, I do know who these scholars are, having studied New Testament textual criticism<br>
at the University of Chicago with one of the editors of the new "Textus Receptus", i.e., The<br>
Greek New Testament, Third Edition (United Bible Societies) and having worked in the<br>
discipline for over twenty years.<br>
<p>
The international dean of New Testament textual critics is unquestionably Bruce Manning<br>
Metzger, the devote gentleman scholar now retired from Princeton.  No serious discussion in<br>
the field of New Testament textual criticism can ignore his book, The Text of the New<br>
Testament, or his related works.  Other giants in the field in this half of the century include<br>
Matthew Black of St. Andrews and Kurt Aland of Munster.  They not only participated with<br>
Metzger in the editing of the UBS text mentioned above, but have also written extensively on<br>
the subject.  Among the most influential younger scholars are Eldon J. Epp and Gordon Fee. <br>
All these scholars would reject any notion of the superiority of the text that lies behind the<br>
Authorized Version.  Incidentally, Metzger is the chief editor of the New Revised Standard<br>
Version.<br>
<p>
I have been challenged to produce evidence for some of my previous remarks and, in one<br>
case, to withdraw them if I cannot.  While I consider the tone of latter to be unfortunately<br>
confrontational and forensic, I will nevertheless provide a few responses.  A full discussion of<br>
all the complex material would not be appropriate in this nontechnical context.  Therefore, I<br>
will not lay out the demanded evidence, though this would certainly be possible.  Rather, I<br>
will merely cite some of Metzger's published views.  (Quotes are from the second edition of<br>
his book, noted above.)<br>
<p>
On the work of Erasmus, Metzger writes "For most of the text he relied on two rather inferior<br>
manuscripts from a monastic library at Basle, one of the Gospels (see Plate XV) and one of<br>
the Acts and Epistles, both dating from about the twelfth century.  Erasmus compared them<br>
with two or three others of the same books and entered occasional corrections for the printer<br>
in the margins or between the lines of the Greek script.  For the Book of Revelation he had<br>
but one manuscript, dating from the twelfth century, which he had borrowed from his friend<br>
Reuchlin.  Unfortunately, this manuscript lacked the final leaf, which had contained the last<br>
six verses of the book.  For these verses, as well as a few other passages throughout the book<br>
where the Greek text of the Apocalypse and the adjoining Greek commentary with which the<br>
manuscript was supplied are so mixed up as to be almost indistinguishable, Erasmus depended<br>
upon the Latin Vulgate, translating this text into Greek.  As would be expected from such a<br>
procedure, here and there in Erasmus' self-made Greek text are readings which have never<br>
been found in any known Greek manuscript--but which are still perpetuated today in printings<br>
of the so-called Textus Receptus of the Greek New Testament." (pp. 99-100)  "Thus the text<br>
of Erasmus' Greek New Testament rests upon a half-dozen minuscule manuscripts.  The<br>
oldest and best of these manuscripts (codex 1, a minuscule of the tenth century, which agrees<br>
often with the earlier uncial text) he used least, because he was afraid of its supposedly<br>
erratic text!" (p. 100)<br>
<p>
Metzger proceeds to trace the controlling influence of Erasmus' "inferior" (p. 103) work, with<br>
its "spurious passage" (p. 101) in the third edition found in 1 John 5:8, upon the editions of<br>
Estienne (or Stephanus) and through him to Beze (or Beza) and the Elzevir brothers.  It was<br>
in the preface to the second edition of the Elzevir work that the expression "Textus<br>
Receptus", with the meaning "commonly received, standard text" (p. 106) appeared.  He<br>
concludes his remarks on this period of the history of the printed text in this way: "So<br>
superstitious has been the reverence accorded the Textus Receptus that in some case attempts<br>
to criticize or emend it have been regarded as akin to sacrilege.  Yet its textual basis is<br>
essentially a handful of late and haphazardly collected minuscule manuscripts, and in a dozen<br>
passages its reading is supported by no known Greek witness." (p. 106)<br>
<p>
Far from withdrawing my earlier remark about the "flawed Textus Receptus", I confidently<br>
join Metzger in repeating it with heightened crescendo.<br>
<p>
I am tempted to review the reasons why most scholars consider the type of text of the New<br>
Testament reflected in the Textus Receptus to be inferior to other forms of the text, but I will<br>
mercifully resist.  However, I must remind one respondent that the number of manuscripts<br>
supporting a particular reading, obviously extensive for later periods, is not considered to<br>
significant in deciding among variants.  The principle of most text critics is that you do not<br>
count manuscripts.  You weigh them.  That is, you examine the readings in the light of<br>
generally accepted observations on how texts change through transmission and copying, with<br>
the reasonable assumption that the changes generally move the text farther from the reading<br>
of the original.<br>

I Think that it is interesting that no one has made the additional and most<br>
obvious suggestion to clear up most of this debate.  If the MMS that were<br>
used for the KJV are so accurate then why do we not take those same MMS<br>
and re-translate them into modern english.  We do not live in the 1600's<br>
and most people do not understand 17th century english.  Thus it seems <br>
that the greatest service to mankind would be to re-translate the scriptures<br>
using the original MSS that are to be found the most accurate.<br>
<p>
One other point that I would like to make is in response to something that <br>
Ruben said.  He said that the fact that the newer translations are copyrighted<br>
is proof that they are man's work and not God's Word.  This is absurd.  The <br>
only reason that the KJV is not copyrighted is due to it's age (it is out of<br>
the period of copyright).  The reason that the other translations are copyrighted<br>
is to protect the investment made in time and money to have the translations<br>
made.  This was done at great expense ot the companies involved and they<br>
need to try to protect thier investment so that they can make a profit and <br>
stay afloat.  These are produced by companies that need to make money.  They <br>
are not produced by the government that can just steal from us to pay its bill.<br>
And there is nothing wrong with being a company for profit.  Drug companies<br>
have the same protection as far as patents on new drugs that are put on the <br>
market.  How else are we going to afford new research and new products.  And<br>
the scripture quoted is a perfect example of what people right here on SDAnet<br>
call using the scripture as a club to fit your own purposes.  <br>
<p>
Don't mean to be so pointed but I really felt that needed to be said.  I hope <br>
that we can all continue to discuss this sensitive topic without building <br>
up any animosity.<br>
<p>

Russell Yonkers asks "If the 'textus receptus' is as good as Ruben says it <br>
is, why not make a new modern translation based on it?"  This is exactly <br>
what was done with the New King James version.<br>
<p>
Ruben raised a question to me which I cannot answer since I do not have<br>
the source material available.  Namely, in which manuscripts does the<br>
second <br>
half of 1 John 5:8 not appear?  I am not well acquainted with the manuscripts<br>
and do not have any against which to compare.  I got this story from<br>
Alden Thompson's book but I do not even have that with me right now.<br>
If anyone can help I'll be grateful.<br>
<p>
In Ruben's message there was a long list of verses that are missing or<br>
footnoted in the NIV.  I checked in my NASB where all of them are<br>
footnoted <br>
as well, and in the NRSV.  So here are three recent modern translations<br>
which take the same approach to the text, as Ruben has alleged.  <br>
<p>
However, looking at those verses, I fail to see a doctrinal conspiracy<br>
in leaving them out.  You could take away every one of those verses and <br>
the Bible will still teach the Sabbath, the state of the dead, the second<br>
coming, name any doctrine you will.  I fail to see any true doctrines<br>
which have been stripped or any false doctrines added, with the possible<br>
exception<br>
of the reading of Rev 22:14 which has already been mentioned.<br>

I wasn't exposed much to the KJV as a child since I grew up in South America.  <br>
We had the debate about whether to use the Reina y Valera that Ruben mentioned, <br>
or the 1960 revision thereof.  Well, the original dates from 1569 and was <br>
revised by Valera in 1602, so you can imagine that the language is of the same <br>
style as the KJV.  Adventists in Argentina didn't seem to have much problem <br>
with accepting the revision.  They understood that the new version was easier <br>
to understand and that the younger generation now had an alternative.  Many of <br>
the older generation kept using the original because of habit and feeling <br>
comfortable with the words.<br>
<p>
A note to Ruben.  The Reina y Valera you find so accurate is a Catholic <br>
translation.  Not until the 1960 version sponsored by the International Bible <br>
Society did protestants have much say other than in leaving out the Apocrypha <br>
in their printings.<br>
<p>
I become concerned when we start making sweeping generalizations, or trying to <br>
make everything cut and dried.  Jesuits are not hiding under every bed, nor <br>
taking over the seminary--I should know, my dad is the Dean.  It is time that <br>
we all remembered that knowledge is best acquired first hand.  I would not call <br>
myself a scientist if I accepted what others say without checking it out <br>
myself, going to the sources, comparing other data, etc.  The same is true for <br>
the Bible.  Read as many versions as you can get your hands on, in as many <br>
languages as you are able.  You will multiply the ways the Word can reach your <br>
mind and heart, and the Holy Spirit will guide your understanding.<br>
<p>
Having given my pedigree, please let me add another warning.  Just because <br>
something purports to come from the Seminary doesn't necessarily make it an <br>
official communique, nor the truth.  Just as in any other academic institution, <br>
the faculty at the Seminary have their differences of opinion--sometimes <br>
marked.  They publish and present in different forums and sometimes debate each <br>
other verbally or in writing.  Until someone can show me that appointment to <br>
the seminary faculty endows one with the gift of prophecy, I will take what I <br>
hear and check it out in the Bible.<br>
<p>
On another topic entirely.  The abortion debate seems to be waning, and I do <br>
not mean to start another round of discussion in which people who already know <br>
what they think try to convince other people of equally fixed opinions.  My <br>
concern is this:  what are we doing as individuals and as a church to make <br>
abortion unnecessary?  What about the physical, financial, emotional support of <br>
the women/families with unplanned pregnancies?  What about family planning?  <br>
You see, I work as a nurse-midwife at a teen clinic.  We don't do abortions, <br>
but I provide family planning and prenatal care (among a lot of other things) <br>
to poor minority and-- oh dear!--unmarried teens.  I think that as SDA's we're <br>
so uncomfortable with the idea of non-marital sex that we don't even want to <br>
touch the issue, but we need to address it.  Some of the kids turning up in my <br>
clinic are SDA's.<br>
<p>
Ideas about practical christianity much appreciated.<br>

Here is what William Shea had to say about Daniel 9 and the verse in<br>
question (which I think was 26).  He quotes the RSV phrase "And the people<br>
of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary". <br>
Shea takes the word for prince and sees it as fitting a pattern in the<br>
text.  In verse 25 one has Messiah Prince together, then in verse 26 the<br>
duo of words is split up.  As my own oberservation and one I think that<br>
Steve was running into is that the He who is cut off in the midst of the<br>
week appears to be the same Prince just mentioned in verse 26.  If one<br>
views the Prince to be the Messiah then there is no confusing the person<br>
cut off in the middle of the week as some Roman.  Shea also adds that the<br>
Romans come into the picture as the desolator mentioned later on.  Then to<br>
attempt to explain the verse that has the people of the Prince leading to<br>
the end of the city and sanctuary, Shea notes that while the Romans are<br>
the actual destoryers, the Jews themselves (the people) were the once who<br>
precipitated the destruction through their rebellion (against God and<br>
Romanv vassals).  He also points out how in 26 the end of the city and<br>
sanctuary are foreshadowed so to speak and in verse 27 the final part the<br>
end of the city and sanctuary come.  Just glancing at Maxwell I think his<br>
view of things is different than Shea's.  I hope this has been helpful. <br>
The source used here has been DARCS vol. 3 70 Weeks, Leviticus, Nature of<br>
Prophecy with the specific article being "The Prophecy of Daniel (:24-27"<br>
by William Shea pp. 75-118. <br>

I just read Ruben;s long message about different translations.  He<br>
mentions EGW saying something that endorsed Erasmus' work and I believe he<br>
alluded elsewhere that she has some negative comments about the vulgate. <br>
My question to Ruben or anyone else that might have the answer is where<br>
are these comments by EGW to be found?  My next question is this:  Just<br>
because a group like RCC produceds something does not to me necessiatate<br>
that it is wrong.  If that is the case then the New Testament Canon should<br>
be condemned as someone has already pointed out.  Just because a person or<br>
group is wrong about somethings does not necessitate that they are wrong<br>
about everything. <br>

[From Ruben Gonzales]<br>
Hi all,<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; That's a very interesting comment for you must infer then that all of EGW's</i><br>
<i>&gt; writings are also "man's word" because they were copyrighted.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
	I think you will find that EGW's original texts are not copyrighted,<br>
only the editorial changes to those texts are. That is what the<br>
copyright notice<br>
on the books represent.<br>
<p>
[No, try again.  The initial works were copyright.  Some, but not all<br>
of the copyrights have expired by now.  A large amount of royalties<br>
have been paid to the EGW estate over the years.  SCT]<br>
<p>
<p>
As far as the point I made regarding copyright, which I know seems absurd at<br>
first glance, how about looking past the initial reaction at what the effect<br>
of the copyright really has on scripture.<br>
<p>
If in Tyndales, or Luther's day the scriptures had been copyrighted there would<br>
have been no reformation would there ?<br>
<p>
Ruben.<br>

Carson in his book "The KJV Debate: A Plea for Realism" makes the following<br>
statement:<br>
<p>
...This theory is being presented in popular literature to pastors<br>
and laymen everywhere, may of whom have never read a rebuttal at the<br>
same level and who are not equipped to do the more advanced work that<br>
demonstrates the theory to be false.<br>
<p>
Here Carson is referring to a list of theses used by promoters of the<br>
TR to show the superiority of the TR and its derivatives, and to <br>
denigrate more recent Bible versions which use Alexandrian texts as<br>
well as the Byzantinne texts. The books "Which Bible?", "God wrote<br>
only one Bible" and numerous tract-type publications are among those<br>
Carson sees as being one-sided amongst other things.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately the problem of theories being presented etc. etc. is not<br>
restricted to the debate of Bible versions. There are many instances<br>
particularly in this day and age of media hype where this is done, be<br>
it by politicians, companies, or whoever. It's quite easy to oversimplify<br>
an issue and maybe paint certain parties as imbeciles when you are<br>
determined to back only one side of that issue.<br>
<p>
Even Christians can be guilty of this. Pick any debate such as the<br>
origins issue, this Bible versions discussion, probably the abortion<br>
discussion (I don't know about that SDAnet series, because I was away<br>
when it was on), anything you like, and you will find this being done.<br>
<p>
The discerning individual is forced, then, to either reserve judgment<br>
or to do some eclectic reading of their own, since the most 'convincing'<br>
arguments are usually those which ignore part of a complex issue.<br>
Unfortunately none of us have time to fully investigate some of these<br>
things, particularly when it is realized that various individuals have<br>
devoted their entire lives to the study of any given one of them.<br>
<p>
Fortunately we also have some help...'If anyone lack wisdom, let him<br>
ask of God...'<br>
<p>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
	Russell says :<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This was done at great expense ot the companies involved and they</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to try to protect thier investment so that they can make a profit and </i><br>
<i>&gt; stay afloat.  These are produced by companies that need to make money. </i><br>
<p>
This is a very good point. Lets just consider the factors of marketing for a <br>
moment.<br>
<p>
I personally don't think God's Word is to be made into a commodity, neither<br>
do I believe in making a profit out of God's Word, that amounts to Simony<br>
in my books. (And beleive the the publishers of the modern translations<br>
are making a killing)<br>
<p>
If you had to produce an item, for sale is it not true that you would market<br>
it in order to please the vast majority and make them buy. Even if this meant<br>
leaving out important features and introducing gimmicks into it to help it sell?<br>
<p>
In our case the market it ecumenical, what implications does this have on our<br>
product.<br>
<p>
Ruben.<br>

I have a view on this copywrite issue of bibles and EGW.  I feel that <br>
to give controling power to a commitee to make sure that scripture and EGW <br>
are not slandered, taken way out of contect, and such.  Say for example. <br>
If I was very mad at the church I could take scripture and say something<br>
like, "I say Christ, I will not come to get you again." and then list lots<br>
of verses where I have cut and paste...  But that is a poor example.  I do<br>
think Bible quotation should be monitored for proper use so that we don't <br>
make it say things it doesn't.  But at free cost.<br>
<p>
Maybe I am strange.  But I am for Copywriting everything writen by any<br>
one.  This gives legal support for rights.  Do you want Satan to try to<br>
have so one print a, "Good News Bible" and have it full of new age info? <br>
That would be a violation of a copywrited title.  We could stop the<br>
production of such.  <br>
<p>
Just my ideas..<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
	Steve rightly says that he "fail to see a doctrinal conspiracy<br>
in leaving them out" [some verses].<br>
<p>
The point was not in that there was a conspiracy in leaving them out but they<br>
were omitted from the Siniaticus and Vaticanus because of the poor quality<br>
of the scribe and the texts themselves.<br>
<p>
However there is a conspiracy and now I will reveal it. I will present<br>
three readings of each selected verse, KJV, Douay, and NIV you can judge for<br>
yourselves.<br>
<p>
MAtt 5:44<br>
<p>
KJV 	"But I say unto you, Love your enemies, _bless_them_That_curse_you_, do <br>
	good to them that hate you, pray for those that despitefully use you,<br>
	and persecute you."<br>
DOUAY	"But I say unto you, Love your enemies, ***************************, do <br>
	good to them that hate you, pray for them that persecute and<br>
	calumnate you."<br>
NIV 	"But I tell you, Love your enemies, ***************************, <br>
	and pray for they that persecute you."<br>
<p>
<p>
The phrase _bless_them_That_curse_you_ is omitted from both the Douay and NIV,<br>
the DOUAY is a direct transaltion from the Vulgate.<br>
<p>
Luke 2:33<br>
<p>
KJV	"And _Joseph_ and his mother marvelled at those things which were <br>
	spoken of him." <br>
DOUAY	"And his father and his mother were wondering at those things which were<br>
 	spoken concerning him."<br>
NIV	"The child's father and his mother marvelled at what was said about him."<br>
<p>
Once again the NIV follows the Douay and gives Jesus a human father!<br>
<p>
Luke 4:8<br>
<p>
KJV	"And Jesus answered and said unto him, _get_thee_behind_me,_Satan_: for<br>
	it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt<br>
	thou serve."<br>
DOUAY	"And Jesus answering him said to him, *****************************<br>
	It is written, Thou shalt adore the Lord thy God, and him only shalt<br>
	thou serve."<br>
NIV	"Jesus answered, ******************* *****************************<br>
	It is written, Thou shalt adore the Lord your God, and serve him only."<br>
<p>
The reason why the Douay omitted the words _get_thee_behind_me,_Satan_ is <br>
because Rome hates them because Jesus later used these words regarding Peter<br>
(MArr 16:23) and so this verse destroys Romes notion of Peter as the rock.<br>
Why then does the NIV omit them, is it for the same reason ? The NIV follows<br>
in the footsteps of Rome because it is based on the Vaticanus and Siniaticus.<br>
<p>
1 Cor 15:47<br>
<p>
KJV	"The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is _the _Lord_<br>
	from heaven."<br>
DOUAY	"The first man was, of the earth, earthly: the second man *********<br>
	from heaven, heavenly."<br>
NIV	"The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man *********<br>
	from heaven."<br>
<p>
Who is this man ? why does these other two versions hide the fact it is the <br>
Lord himself?<br>
<p>
Eph 3:9<br>
<p>
KJV	"And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which <br>
	from the beginnning of the world hath been hid in God, _who_created_<br>
	_all_things_by_Jesus_Christ_."<br>
DOUAY	"And to enlighten all men that they may see what is the dispensation<br>
	of the mystery, which has been hidden from eternity in God, <br>
	who created all things."<br>
KJV	"And to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which<br>
	for ages past was kept hidden in God who created all things.<br>
<p>
Here we have a denial of the fact that it was Jesus who created all things.<br>
Now this is a key scripture for confirming Jesus as teh creator and establishing<br>
his pre-existance.<br>
<p>
I could go on, there are many more verses like this, that support the Vulgate<br>
and its multitude of errors, I will if I get a request, otherwise I think<br>
the point is suitably demonstrated.<br>

<i>&gt; One thing that puzzles me about the current discussion is the authorities </i><br>
<i>&gt; cited.  I have yet to see the name of a scholar who is generally considered </i><br>
<i>&gt; to be a first order authority on New Testament textual criticism.</i><br>
<p>
I believe you will find this to be true only because none of the authorities<br>
cited are contempory ones, as in they are all dead.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; [...whole lot of current authorities cited... .]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
It might be interesting if you could tell us the affiliations of these<br>
authorites, and how enthusiastic they are personally regarding the<br>
ecumenical movement and its Roman trend.<br>
<p>
Remember the two most eminient authorities (in their day) Westcott and<br>
Hort also hated the Textus Receptus and the reason we well know, becuase<br>
they were Romanists through and through.<br>
<p>
It is well to say that these current scholars reject the notion of the <br>
superiority of hte Textus Receptus, but saying so means nothing at all to me,<br>
so did Westcott and Hort and friends. When it comes to current scholars<br>
it would be well to know their theological leanings.<br>
<p>
I don't share your feelings that requesting evidence is confrontational.<br>
Without supporting evidence opinions are of no weight, and to a large extent<br>
useless. I ask for evidence because only in this way can one learn and bring<br>
to light the truth which many times is buried under the traditions of men.<br>
<p>
As for Metzger's attack on Erasmus and his work, I am affraid it is his word<br>
against the word of many others.<br>
<p>
Now you may not have heard of Dr.F.C. Cook but considering his position as<br>
the Chaplan to Q.E. and being invited to sit on the Revision committee, I would<br>
suspect that he has sufficent authority to comment. You read his testimony<br>
supporting the T.R. I can get you many others like his if you like, but I need<br>
not, EGW who has the highest authority in this respect confirms his word.<br>
Now if an an SDA I am to choose between the Spirit of Prophecy and a <br>
current (protestant/Catholic/liberal/ecumenical, whichever fits) scholar<br>
you know which one I will choose.<br>
<p>
You quote from Metzger that various readings found in the KJV are not supported<br>
by any other Greek text. is he here refering to Rev 22:14, I hope he is not<br>
for in that case he would be grossly in error. As for Erasmus' supposed use of <br>
only a "handful of late and haphazardly collected minuscule manuscripts"<br>
I think<br>
once again I should quote from Dr Cook<br>
<p>
<p>
"That textus receptus was taken in the first instance, from late cursive <br>
manuscripts; but its readings are maintained only so far as they agree with<br>
the earliest and best Greek and Latin Fathers, and with the vast majority of <br>
unical and cursive manuscipts." Revised Version of the first three<br>
Gospels, p226<br>
<p>
Who are we to believe ? In the current ecumenical atmosphere I know who I will<br>
believe. Metzger calls Erasmus' work  "inferior" EGW endorses this same<br>
work saying it corrected the errors of the existing texts. Whom should we <br>
believe ?<br>
<p>
Ganted that EGW never had such as distinguished title recognised by the world<br>
but she had another title recognised in heaven. <br>
<p>
<p>
I have shown that all other texts originate from and are supported by<br>
and in turn support the RCC and the Latin Vulgate. This family of texts<br>
sets itself understandibly against the T.R. which does not originate from<br>
the RCC. We know how the RCC views the scripture, we have but one of two<br>
roads to take, the one that leads to Rome, or the road of the Reformation.<br>
<p>
[You have not shown this.  You have asserted it many times but this is <br>
not the same.  You have not shown that the Sinaiticus/Vaticanus codices are<br>
the primary ones used in the modern translations.  You have not shown where<br>
the modern translations follow the Vulgate, only asserted.  You have<br>
not shown that any of the changes that you listed save Rev. 22:14 make<br>
any doctrinal difference whatsoever.  You have not shown that Erasmus<br>
was free from RCC influences in compiling the TR.  SCT]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The principle of most text critics is that you do not count manuscripts.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; You weigh them.  That is, you examine the readings in the light of generally </i><br>
<i>&gt; accepted observations on how texts change through transmission and copying, </i><br>
<i>&gt; with the reasonable assumption that the changes generally move the text </i><br>
<i>&gt; farther from the reading of the original.</i><br>
<p>
What this  in effect is saying, is that one must take the testimony of<br>
the Vaticanus and ths Siniaticus over and above the testimony of all<br>
other texts. In this case then do you think the Apocrypha including<br>
such masterly works as "Bel and the Dragon" and the Epistle of St. Barnabus<br>
(which you have all had a change to admire) should be found in all bibles ?<br>
<p>
As for antiquity why is it then that while Rev 22:14 is quoted as per<br>
the KJV back in 200AD before the date of these other two MSS which have a <br>
wrong readings it is ignored and preference given to the clearly erroneous<br>
texts ?<br>
<p>
I do not think that one has the right to ignore the bulk of testimony which is<br>
to the contrary, and choose a singluar reading just because it suits the <br>
translator(s) best.<br>
<p>
This principle raises some interesting questions then in light of the <br>
two MSS which have been endosed by some as being more reliable and older.<br>
Let me quote some more for you regarding these texts, which are set up in<br>
opposition to the T.R.<br>
<p>
Dr. Scrivener says speaking of the 2556 omission in the Vaticanus<br>
"..That no small proportion of those are mere oversights of the scribe seems <br>
evident from the circumstance that this same scribe has repeatedly written <br>
words and clauses twice over, a class of mistakes which Mai and the collators <br>
have seldom thought fit to notice, insomuch as the false addition has not been <br>
retraced by the second hand, but which by no means enhances our estimate of <br>
the care employed in copying this veneranle record of primitive Christianity"<br>
			"Introduction", Vol.1. p.120<br>
<p>
Dr Scrivener published a book regarding the Siniaticus entitled<br>
"A full Collation of the Codex Siniaticus," and in his introduction he writes :<br>
"The Codex is covered with such alterations {obviously of a textual nature}<br>
brought in by at least ten different revisers, some of them systematically<br>
spread over every page, others occasional or limited to separate portions<br>
of the manuscript, many of them being comtemporaneous with the first writer,<br>
far the greater part belonging to the sixth or seventh century." p.XIX<br>
<p>
Here is a quote from Philip Mauro regarding the quality of the Siniaticus,<br>
"But there are other characteristics of this old MS which have to be taken into<br>
consideration if a correct estimate of its evidential value is to be reached.<br>
Thus, there are internal evidences that lead to the conclusion that it was the <br>
work of a scribe who was singularly careless, or incompetent, or both. In <br>
this MS the arrangement of the lines is peculiar, there being four columns<br>
on each page, each line containing about twelve letters - all capitals run <br>
together. There is no attempt to end a word at the end of a line, for even<br>
words having two letters as en, ek, are split in the middle, the last letter<br>
being carried over to the beginning of hte next line, though there was ample <br>
room for it on the line preceeding. This and other peculiarities give us an <br>
idea of the character and competence of the scribe"  "which Version", p.45<br>
<p>
Here is a bit more about the reliability of the Siniaticus from Dr. Scrivener<br>
"This manuscript must have been derived from one more ancient, in which the <br>
lines were similarly divided, since the writer occasionally omits just the <br>
number of letters which would suffice to fill a line, and that to the utter<br>
ruin of the sense; as if his eye had heedlessly wandered to the line <br>
immediately below. Instances of this want of care will be found Luke 21:8;<br>
22:25. perhaps John 4:45; 12:25, where complete lines are omitted; John 19:26; <br>
Heb 13:18 (partly corrected); Apoc 8:16; 19:12; 22:2, where the copyist passed <br>
in teh middle of a line to the corresponding portion of teh line below. It must<br>
 be confessed, indeed, that the Codex Siniaticus abounds with similar errors of<br>
 eye and pen, to an extent not unparalleled, but hapily rather unsusual in <br>
documents of first rate importance."  "Collation on the Codex Siniaticus" P.XV<br>
<p>
Now in light of these observations in transmssion and copying how can anybody<br>
state that these texts are more reliable. And even if they were faithful to<br>
the original MS from which they eminate that would only further condemn<br>
them because as I have demonstrated they originate with Origen, Constantine<br>
and Esubius who were most interested in purverting the scriptures in order<br>
to facilitate the ecumenical movement at the time of uniting Christianity<br>
with pagansim.<br>
<p>
These text support the readings of the LAtin Vulgate (obviously) and<br>
so by EGW's own condemnation we know that they are not more relyable but<br>
more erroneous than the T.R. which _corrected_ these errors.<br>

Believe it or not, there are many scholars in the world who do their<br>
darndest to discover the truth about something, rather than merely<br>
using their title as a "scholar" or an "intellectual" to advance a<br>
previously held belief or theory.<br>
<p>
<p>
It is unfair to fire a broad accusation at a range of scholars to the<br>
effect that their own theological position or belief will necessarily<br>
influence their work, and possibly invalidate it. There have been<br>
demonstrable instances where this *has* occurred, such as early<br>
attempts to 'gnosticize' the scripture, or to promote aryan views.<br>
This does not, however, imply that all or even the majority of<br>
scholars operate this way.<br>
<p>
Whether or not Westcott &amp; Hort, Fee and others were Romanists,<br>
whether or not they were all supporters of the ecumenical movement<br>
I do not know. Judging their scholarship and professionalism is<br>
another thing altogether.<br>
<p>
Remember - Erasmus *never left* the Catholic church, not even<br>
after four or five editions of his printed Greek scripture.<br>

<i>&gt; A note to Ruben.  The Reina y Valera you find so accurate is a Catholic </i><br>
<i>&gt; translation.  Not until the 1960 version sponsored by the International Bible </i><br>
<i>&gt; Society did protestants have much say other than in leaving out the Apocrypha </i><br>
<i>&gt; in their printings.</i><br>
<p>
I never said it was very accurate, I just said that one main error which<br>
attacked SDA doctrine was to be found in Hebrews, I am aware it is a Catholic <br>
translation. There is no equivalent to the KJV in Spanish but if one had<br>
to be found the Reina y Valera version from 1601 would have to count<br>
due to its language and age.<br>

*Date:         Sun, 23 Feb 1992 12:17:00 EST<br>
<p>
I'm trying to switch a list over to being moderated.  The<br>
LISTSERVer sends the messages to me with a "moderator paragraph"<br>
at the top instructing me to forward the message back to the list<br>
if it is ok.  I have access to either a Vax/VMS or Unix system.<br>
<p>
With VMSmail, when I FORWARD the message back to the list, it<br>
converts the incoming mail header to text.  In other words, it<br>
goes back with a new header on it and a blank line before the old<br>
header.  The information in the original header is lost to the<br>
LISTSERVer and the big, ugly header appears in the text.<br>
<p>
On the Unix system, I use ELM.  The FORWARD command does<br>
essentially the same thing: the incoming header is converted to<br>
text.  The BOUNCE command sends the message on with the original<br>
header intact.  But for some reason, the LISTSERVer does not<br>
remove the "moderator paragraph."  I have attached below a sample<br>
of a message (as posted to the list) which was sent back by the<br>
editor using the ELM command BOUNCE.<br>
<p>
Does anyone have any useful suggestions?  How do other people act<br>
as list editors from non-VM/CMS systems?<br>
<p>
                          Peace,  Dan<br>

LISTSERV wants you to forward  the message using the 'Resent-' mechanism,<br>
which the Internet un*x people designed and documented for the purpose of<br>
then not using  it when they wrote mail programs.  The original header is<br>
kept as is, and  the user interface adds a set of  'Resent-' tags for the<br>
new message.  You can't get VMSmail  to do that because  it knows nothing<br>
about RFC822. Maybe ELM has some switch that will make it do that.<br>

You can't.  In the  next version  you'll be  able to  do a  'GET listname
(HEADER' to retrieve  just the header. You can then  extract it, edit it,
and PUT it back.  Again, this does NOT work with 1.6e;  do NOT attempt to
send back just the header, it would delete all the subscribers.

I've done this when our BITNet link to AU was down, but our Internet
connection was up. You just need to send mail to the LISTSERV rather
than trying to send messages.
<p>
Make sure that the "Owner=" is set to the Internet address from which
you'll be mailing commands. BITnet user who have access both ways can
add both their BITNet and Internet IDs:
<p>
Owner=XRJDM@SCFVM,xrjdm@scfvm.gsfc.nasa.gov
<p>
I believe there's a "QUIET" option that can keep one of the two
aliases from getting messages.

        I run one from a VMS machine, sending everything by
the JNET (I guess) command "send/file". Works fine! E-mail
would be less convenient; for example I can have Listserv
send me my filelist _as_ a file (no mail headers, I can see
the filename without looking at the contents, ...).

Greetings,
<p>
        I hear, from various sources, that there is a
Listserv for Unix. I'm skeptical, but willing to be led to
believe....
<p>
        A Unix Listserv would have, I suppose, these
features of VM/CMS Listserv (and probably more):
<p>
        1. Instances of the Unix Listserv and instances of
the VM Listserv would form a single collection, each element
aware of the location of each other.
<p>
        2. DIST2 and RFD functions would be available
(however they work in a mixed Internet-Bitnet world).
<p>
        3. GET and PUT commands conveyed to an instance of a
Unix Listserv would be handled as we are used to.
<p>
        4. SUBSCRIBE, SIGNOFF, ADD, DELETE, would work as in
VM.
<p>
        5. A Unix Listserv could be managed "at a distance",
by sending commands and files (presumably by MAIL, for the
Unix version), just as the VM version can.
<p>
        Does such a thing really exist?
<p>
Cheers, N.

I can't believe that it would be that hard to write a shell script under
Unix that would emulate the ( strictly finite ) number of operations that
LISTSERV supports, applying the documented syntax in search of the docu-
-mented set of possible commands and generating LISTSERV-like messages on
those occasions when the command violates the constraints of the syntax.
<p>
Set up a mail address, which, in Unix, would evaluate to an entry in the
aliases database, possibly a password entry to allow account management,
and a file for mail to accumulate in. Write the script to read the file
once every so often, read each message, act appropriately, zero the file
and split. Add some mechanisms to keep the script from zeroing the file
when it's being accessed by the mail delivery agent. You're done.
<p>
Once the script works, turn it into a *simple* C program. Runs faster,
less likely to crash.
<p>
If there is an Internet group meeting on the topic of LISTSERV, I would
predict that they are meeting to agree on a common command syntax so that
all LISTSERVs behave identically, much as FTP and telnet behave identically
under diverse operating systems. The actual implimentation of a LISTSERV
is trivial, IMHO.

The one I have some experience with was developed at
Boston University.  It does not have all the features of
Revised LISTSERV (for instance, it does not support
automatic archives of discussion lists), and those commands
that it does have sometimes work differently from those in
Revised LISTSERV (for instance, to change your name on
a subscription list, you must first UNSUBSCRIBE and then
SUBSCRIBE under the new name--SUBSCRIBE does not update
or replace the old name).
<p>
If anyone here subscribed to NET-TRAIN@cornell.edu, you
saw some of the problems I had with the Boston University
listserv.

there is an Internet Task Force Working Group on this.  One member of that
group is Chris Myers (chris@wugate.WUstl.edu) who has a prototype that does
some of the basic functions.  I have not kept current on the ongoing work, but
there is progress.  Obviously it responds only to mail commands, no TELL or

&gt;&gt;I am having a serious problem.  On a very regular basis, I am
&gt;&gt;seeing my UCX SMTP daemon die, with no apparent loggable reason.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;VMS:  Ver 5.4-2.
&gt;&gt;PMDF: Ver 3.2.
&gt;&gt;UCX:  Ver 1.3.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The error I am seeing is the following...
&gt;&gt;(only message in pmdf_root:[log]err_utcp_local_slave.log)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;"os_smtp_read: Read failed. status = Unknown error: 0."
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;That's it.  And the detached daemon process disappears.   No other
&gt;&gt;information can be found.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;OUTBOUND mail using UCX works just fine.   SOME incoming mail arrives,
&gt;&gt;then the utcp daemon grinds to a halt with the above message.
&gt;
&gt;My problem is exactly the same.
<p>
Ah finally the folks at the University of Leiden admit to having problems.
<p>
Probably it's unrelated to the UCX problem, but the machine
rulway.LeidenUniv.nl
is definitely wrongly configured.  That's the next hop from Ryko's machine.
I recall an excellent (what else !) explanation from Ned recently what causes
the symptoms described below.
<p>
Rulway.LeidenUniv.nl has been bouncing *vast* amounts of mail from our Netserv
with the beautiful Unuchs error message :
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt; 553 rulway.LeidenUniv.nl I refuse to talk to myself
554 &lt;WMBKARRE@rulgl.LeidenUniv.nl&gt;... Service unavailable: Bad file number
<p>
Ned's explanation of that was that the machine doesn't know its own name :-)
<p>
Mx records for the LeidenUniv.NL domain point (amongst others) to rulway
so I suggest you get that machine fixed as the first step in trying to
locate the problems.
<p>
Btw.  I may be slightly biased, but I get the impression that an awfully
high percentage of Unix sendmail configurations are broken ... I'd be
interested in hearing other PostMasters' experience.

I'm on a Unix machine in Mississippi, running WORDS-L on a VM system
in Georgia.  Before the new version of listserv, I had to use bitnet
to get and put the list headers.  (I would get the file interactively,
then put it back with the 'netcopy' command.)  Now that it's possible
to get the headers only, I do everything by internet mail.  I get
the headers by sending this command to the listserv:
get words-l (header
And I mail it back to the listserv.  It works fine.

Use the 'GET listname (HEADER' option to get and update just the header.
This works only on release 1.7.

That's all very well for editing the header.  How about making
additions or changes to FILELIST?  Is it possible to use ftp or
telnet?  LISTSERV@VTVM2 is accessible either via VTVM2.BITNET or
VTVM2.CC.VT.EDU.  It does not seem to have an anonymous setup but
I do have access via telnet to an account on VTVM2.  I have
attempted to use the local system to edit and replace the
FILELIST but without success because the VM/SP system requires a
3270 emulation which I have not been able to achieve on my PC at
home.  It would be very convenient to use ftp to get the file,
edit it, and replace it.  Can this be done?  If so, how do I
locate the file?

<p>
No, and  yes. You can't use  FTP because it is  totally incompatible with
the security/access  rules of LISTSERV,  and it  is also not  possible to
allow  people to  directly modify  the file  LISTSERV is  using (as  when
writing it  back with  FTP) because  serious problems  will ensue  if the
contents are invalid. You can use  TELNET to access the local system and,
provided you have authorized this userid,  retrieve the file, edit it and
store it back.  A third possibility is  to avoid lines longer  than 80 in
the filelist.

&gt;FILELIST but  without success because  the VM/SP system requires  a 3270
&gt;emulation which I have not been able to achieve on my PC at home.
<p>
It doesn't require it, but if you want full screen access you do need it.
You could always get the file in LPUNCH format via mail, convert it, edit
it locally, FTP it back to  your VTVM2 account's private directory, login
in line mode and just issue the  SENDFILE command to send the result back
to the server (or even use RSH if available).

*Date:         Sun, 27 Sep 1992 20:37:50 +0100
<p>
One of the "building blocks" added to  the next version of LISTSERV is an
internal command  called X-B64 which a  future version could use  to pass
binary DISTRIBUTE jobs over mail gateways.  Before you ask, I haven't got
any  serious plan,  schedule or  time  frame for  supporting LISTSERV  on
non-BITNET systems; I am adding this  now because it happened to fit with
what I have  been coding recently and  I know it would take  me twice the
time to add  it in 6 months.  Furthermore it will make  testing easier to
have this feature  already available on a number of  servers when writing
the code for non-BITNET hosts.
<p>
I then  realized that  there is  no reason to  restrict this  function to
server-to-server  interactions, since  users without  BITNET connectivity
could greatly benefit from a simple  but robust encoding system for their
list and file management requests. So I made the command public and wrote
a  sample C  program for  unix users.  Currently only  LISTSERV@SEARN has
support for this  format, but the comments in the  program explain how to
reach  any  server  through  one  that supports  X-B64.  The  program  is
available  from LISTSERV@SEARN  via 'GET  LB64.C'. The  LISTSERV code  to
support this format  adds up to 815kb  and a bunch of files  once all the
pre-reqs are included so I don't want  to package it as a FIX file, there
have been  a number  of massive  "global changes"  which have  never been
tested  outside SEARN.  If you  really want  it I  can supply  CARD decks
similar to those used for beta-testing,  and with the same disclaimers as
for beta-testing.

&gt;Eric,  I believe  you said  once  before that  you had  no objection  to
&gt;Listserv being rewritten for other platforms  as long as you didn't have
&gt;to do it. Would that go also for porting it to the Internet/NREN?
<p>
I'm not Apple, I don't sue people  for trying to make software that looks
like mine  - at least  not as long  as they make  it clear it  isn't *my*
software but rather something that just looks like it.
<p>
&gt;It's  hard  for me  to  imagine  NREN  hosting  forums without  a  fully
&gt;empowered, real Listserv, although newsgroups might be a possibility.
<p>
LISTSERV, like VM or VMS,  is "ancient/obsolete" technology. The Internet
folks are  only interested in  "modern" technology. "Modern"  means "unix
feel" (unix is  actually a very old operating system,  and it has changed
less in the last 5-10 years than VM or VMS, hence the quotes). News, WAIS
and the like  are "modern" and will  be the "strategic" tools  to be used
for such  things. Of course nobody  will prevent anyone from  using other
tools, as long as they find the time to develop them.

I would like to second Kathryn Wright's concerns re. BITNET as a safe
academic haven.  The Internet *is* becoming increasingly more commercial.
And who can keep up with the volume of mail on some of these Usenet places?
I'm just bearly getting familiar with some readnews features ... and my
first impressions are that BITNET *does* seem to have more academic
substance/integrity than the Internet ... in all of its anarchy and
multi-faceted talk options, commercial service offerings, et al.
<p>
Also, I very much appreciate the TELL command aspects of BITNET, particularly
as a listowner.  I have been maintaining two listserv sites ... one locally,
using Eric's revised LISTSERV, and one on a remote Unix/Internet site,
using the Kotsikona's "Discussion List server system."  I think there
are benefits and drawbacks to either set up, but from purely a listowner/
user standpoint, I have to vote Eric's package as the easier, more
convenient to maintain ... and this is not only because it is local.
I cannot send interactive commands to the Unix host, which means I
must send email messages OR edit the list everytime I want to add or
delete a subscriber or change their options.  Also, there is no database
application for searching the list server system archives ... features
I sorely miss on the Unix host.
<p>
There are other little things.  Like for a non-techie listowner, the
listserv commands/set-ups of Eric's LISTSERV are well documented and
fairly easy to fathom once one gets a bit familiar ... I'm not sure
this is as true of the Unix/Internet configuration, but I'm newer to that.
<p>
 From a purely non technical, off-the-top of my head response, I would
hate to lose the convenience of a nice, easy-to-use LISTSERV package ...
and the TELL features that make listownership a breeze instead of a
bear!   But that's just my two cents worth ... and some of this has
already been discussed before in another context ....

Hi all,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have shown that all other texts originate from and are supported by</i><br>
<i>&gt; and in turn support the RCC and the Latin Vulgate. This family of texts</i><br>
<i>&gt; sets itself understandibly against the T.R. which does not originate from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the RCC. We know how the RCC views the scripture, we have but one of two</i><br>
<i>&gt; roads to take, the one that leads to Rome, or the road of the Reformation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [You have not shown this.  You have asserted it many times but this is </i><br>
<i>&gt; not the same.  You have not shown that the Sinaiticus/Vaticanus codices are</i><br>
<i>&gt; the primary ones used in the modern translations. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That the Siniaticus/Vaticanus is the primary text used in the RSV is beyond<br>
contention. Most of the quotes I have presented are direct arguments<br>
against Westcott and Hort's text which relied almost exclusively on<br>
these to MSS. Dr. Cook's testimony is particularly relevant since he was<br>
chosen to sit on the review committee and he refused, later publishing<br>
his views in his book "Revised Version of the First three Gospels."<br>
<p>
"But it is precisely on this ground that I have throughtout maintained<br>
the wrongfulness of the innovations introduced into the Revised Version,<br>
so far as they affect leading facts and great words recorded in the first<br>
three gospels. The reader need but look at the passages enumerated in the<br>
classification given above, p.136 seq., to be convinced that so far from<br>
resting upon the consentient testimony of ancient manuscripts, Versions,<br>
and Fathers by far the greater number of innovations, including those which<br>
give teh severest shocks to our minds, are adopted on the authority of<br>
two manuscripts (Vaticanus and Siniaticus), or even of one manuscript, against<br>
the distinct testimony of all other manuscripts, unicial and cursive." p.227<br>
<p>
I do not thing anybody will disagree that the Vat. and Sin. MSS were those<br>
principly used by Westcott and Hort in the RSV. If someone still doubts<br>
I can bring further testimony to bear. <br>
<p>
It can be simply shown that the other new translations are also derived<br>
from Westcott and Hort's Greek text simply by comparing the variant readings<br>
if they agree with this text then they are derived from it because<br>
as has been repeatedly demonstrated all the other MSS disagree with many<br>
of the variant readings it contains. This can be further demonstrated by<br>
taking note of the omissions, if a version omits the same text as the<br>
Westcott and Hort text then it is derived from it.<br>
<p>
Lets see the NIV has a note after Mark 16:8 it says<br>
"The two most reliable early manuscipts do not have Mark 16:9-20"<br>
<p>
Which two MSS do we think these are ? Well we are not left to ponder too much<br>
because if we go to the Note in the NKJV alongside this same passage we read<br>
<p>
"They are lacking in Codex Siniaticus and Codex Vaticanus, although nearly<br>
all other manuscripts of Mark contain them."<br>
<p>
How very interesting, so the only authority the Translators of the NIV had<br>
to omit these verses was the Vat. and Sin. MSS. Do you think that is good<br>
enough a reason to "take away the words of this book" ?<br>
<p>
<p>
Granted that maybe instead of saying all I should have said most, but the fact<br>
still remains. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You have not shown where</i><br>
<i>&gt; the modern translations follow the Vulgate, only asserted. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
You have seen in my other post how the newer translations<br>
parallel the Latin Vulgate. Would you like some more evidence ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You have</i><br>
<i>&gt; not shown that any of the changes that you listed save Rev. 22:14 make</i><br>
<i>&gt; any doctrinal difference whatsoever. </i><br>
<p>
Are you suggesting that removing the condition of keeping the commandments<br>
for salvation makes _no_ doctrinal difference ?<br>
<p>
The verse as it reads in the new translations is meaningless, so what if I do<br>
the washing, that will have no impact on salvation. Note that the changed <br>
version does not say "wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb" had it<br>
said this then it would have at least made some sense.<br>
<p>
The amount of difference it makes, even though it is important still does<br>
not alter the fact that the Word of God was willfully altered. Even if this<br>
was the only occurance this would be sufficent, to look at the text suspiciously.<br>
<p>
What does Dan 7 say regarding those who whould "think to change the times and<br>
the laws" ?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; You have not shown that Erasmus</i><br>
<i>&gt; was free from RCC influences in compiling the TR.  SCT]</i><br>
<p>
No you are right in this point I have not, I believe EGW's testimony suffices<br>
for me in this regard. Also the point that he was in continual trouble with<br>
the RCC endorses it. Of course he may not be compeletely free was Martin Luther<br>
or Tyndale, to what extent any of us are free from the environment we live<br>
in and our own history is very hard to tell. The point is that EGW tells us<br>
that God used him to do a work, and that work was to supply a bible cleared<br>
from many of the errors present in the Vulgate.<br>

<i>&gt; I personally don't think God's Word is to be made into a commodity, neither</i><br>
<i>&gt; do I believe in making a profit out of God's Word, that amounts to Simony</i><br>
<i>&gt; in my books.</i><br>
<p>
Hey Ruben, _Simony???_  Lighten up!  I can sympathize with your desire in <br>
getting God's word out as cheaply as possible.  In fact, I've got an Uncle <br>
who has spent the last 20 years full-time printing Bibles gratis.<br>
<p>
However, just think for a moment what it would require for there to be<br>
_no profit_ made out of a Bible.<br>
<p>
Printers work gratis.<br>
Paper makers work gratis.<br>
Timbercutters work gratis.<br>
Chainsaw dealers work gratis.<br>
The people who make the screws which go into chainsaws work gratis.<br>
etc. etc. etc.<br>
<p>
The free-market is simply a device to get large groups of people who<br>
don't even know each other to nevertheless cooperate together.  What's<br>
more its the most efficient method so far invented.  And the engine of <br>
the free-market is the profit motive.  There are people, like my uncle,<br>
who operate for reasons other than pure profit and greed, but even he<br>
needs to eat and that requires money which requires that _somebody_<br>
makes a profit to donate to him.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you had to produce an item, for sale is it not true that you would market</i><br>
<i>&gt; it in order to please the vast majority and make them buy. Even if this meant</i><br>
<i>&gt; leaving out important features and introducing gimmicks into it to help it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  sell?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In our case the market it ecumenical, what implications does this have on our</i><br>
<i>&gt; product.</i><br>
<p>
Here again I think you're shadow boxing.  The neat thing about God is that<br>
he doesn't have to rely on man's institutions in order to preserve the<br>
integrity of his word.  God won't let his word get conformed to the<br>
tastes of people; he transforms the tasts of people to his word.<br>

<i>&gt; Remember - Erasmus *never left* the Catholic church, not even</i><br>
<i>&gt; after four or five editions of his printed Greek scripture.</i><br>
<p>
This is very true and for those interested in why he never left the RCC<br>
you should read G.C. p192, Basically the reason is simple, he was afraid,<br>
he was afraid of what the leadership of the church and the scholars of the day<br>
would think or do to him for standing apart from them.<br>

<i>&gt;Ruben raised a question to me which I cannot answer since I do not have</i><br>
<i>&gt;the source material available.  Namely, in which manuscripts does the</i><br>
<i>&gt;second half of 1 John 5:8 not appear?  I am not well acquainted with the </i><br>
manuscripts<br>
<i>&gt;and do not have any against which to compare.</i><br>
<p>
I've nearly decided that there is no point in arguing with Ruben, as we <br>
clearly have different perspectives on the issue... Every doctrine can be <br>
supported by a host of other texts and by the internal (theological) <br>
consistency of scripture. We need to be less fixated on the words, and and <br>
more fixed on the Word. I am all for an accurate rendition of scripture in <br>
any language (including Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic), but I am more for clear <br>
understanding and practice of its principals. The bottom line: keep <br>
reading, and read widely. The modern translations won't grease the path to <br>
hell, and are far more likely to help you ask questions and probe for <br>
answers to the bigger questions of life.<br>
<p>
Your question on 1Jn 5:8 is phrased better if you ask "What manuscripts do <br>
contain the second half of 1Jn 5:8?". Bruce Metzger, in "A Textual <br>
<p>
only 4; and comments that had the early church fathers known it, they would <br>
have certainly used it in the Trinitarian controversies... These 4 (in the <br>
arcane cataloging of Greek scholarship) are:<br>
<p>
ms. 61, 	16th century, held in Dublin.<br>
ms. 629,	14/15th century, held in the Vatican.<br>
ms. 88,	12 century, held in Naples. The passage in question is <br>
"written in the margin in a modern hand".<br>
ms. 635,	11th century, the passage is written in the margin "in a <br>
17th century hand".<br>
<p>
Metzger has two additional books, "The Text of the New Testament, its <br>
Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration" (Oxford, Clarendon Press 1964), <br>
and "The Early Versions of the New Testament, their Origin, Transmission, <br>
and Limitations" (Oxford, Clarendon 1975) that may help if you can find <br>
them.<br>
<p>
I have often wished for a CDROM containing these original manuscripts, as <br>
well as the early historical sources. What some spent years collating could <br>
be done in minutes, leaving the time for more serious issues in textual <br>
reconstruction. Unfortunately some issues (style and dating) aren't <br>
resolved without access to at least facsimile copies of the works. For <br>
another step out on the limb, how about additional CDROMs with facsimiles <br>
of EGW's works? Interesting issues of editorial process...<br>
<p>
Hope this helps<br>
<p>

After I saw the post by my good friend Andy Arkusinski telling about himself<br>
I decided it was time for me to do the same.  I used to go to church in the <br>
Wyoming SDA church with Andy and Holly until we moved from Grand Rapids to <br>
Stevensville, MI (next to Berrien Springs the heart of the Adventist holy<br>
land ((tongue in cheek))).  I work for Zenith Data Systems as a LAN           <br>
administrator.  I am a Novell CNE and am learning Unix by immersion (just<br>
throw me in and I will either sink or swim).  <br>
<p>
I am married and have 5 kids with another on the way.  Currently 2 boys and<br>
3 girls (of course we are hoping for another boy). My wife is a musician.<br>
Karen (my wife) spent 4 years at Hope college as a music major and was only<br>
a year away from finishing when I swept her away to married life (it was a <br>
5 year degree program).  She still keeps in music in the church.  My life <br>
centers around my family and my computer.  I am learning programing right now<br>
(dBase, Quickbasic, and Toolbook for MS Windows) and hope to go back to school<br>
soon to get a degree in computer science (where I am sure that I will be   <br>
introduced to the joys of C programming!).  <br>
<p>
One last thing.  Andy forgot to mention in his that he plays a mean trumpet<br>
and baritone.  I know these things because he has played in groups with <br>
my wife.<br>
<p>
Well gotta run now.  Time to make those big bucks just to send them <br>
all to Slick Wille (opps I promised my wife I would be nicer to him)<br>
to President Clinton (America held hostage, day _).<br>

I was reading one of Rubens messages this morning and saw a very interesting<br>
and troublesome point made.  This had to do with a verse that tells us that<br>
we are only able to claim salvation by keeping the commandments. (This is a<br>
paraphrase and if I am wrong feel free to correct me Ruben)  I have been<br>
reciently doing some in depth studies into rightousness or justification<br>
by faith and find that the statement of the necessity of keeping the <br>
commandments for salvation is in sharp contradiction to a true understanding <br>
of rightousness by faith.  As a matter of fact the idea of being able to do<br>
things for our salvation is in the same vain as the theology of the Catholic<br>
church.  I don't want to make this a extremly large letter or dissertation on<br>
the subject mainly do to the fact that I need to get back to work soon but<br>
I have started a manuscript that I would be happy to send to anyone on this <br>
topic.  <br>
<p>
This primary point however is that according to scripture we are not saved<br>
in the least by what we do short of simply accepting the work of Christ on <br>
the cross.  This is amply shown both in scripture and in the writings of <br>
EGW.  God did ALL the work that brings us to salvation.  This is also what<br>
is refered to when it says in scripture that no unholy or unclean thing will <br>
enter the new jeruselum (sp).  We are made clean through the shed blood of <br>
Jesus Christ and it is in this that we are no longer unclean or unholy.  This<br>
is the gospel that was protected by the Waldensians and restored to prominance<br>
by the Reformation.  It is also the message that we need to proclaim if we<br>
are indeed the true continuation of the reformation that we claim.  <br>
<p>
This is not to be viewed as an excuse to continue in sin and do whatever <br>
we want.  But our lives after salvation is the work of sanctification and <br>
growth not the work of justification and salvation.  We are told over and over<br>
that our lives will be a constant struggle against Satan until Jesus comes<br>
again but that there can be victory.  This only can come however through the<br>
work of the Holy Spirit AFTER our salvation and acceptance into Gods courts!<br>
<p>
I have probably just opened a huge debate, however it is only through discussion<br>
and debate and study that we can ever discover the truth.<br>
<p>
As I have said, if anyone would like a copy of the manuscript that I am working<br>
on just email me and I will be happy to send it out.  I would saw however that <br>
this material is copyright by me and hopefully will be a book some day soon.<br>
(I have to have some way to feed my wife and 6 kids!)  So I would appriciate <br>
it be treated as such. ... Well since it is such a small section of the whole<br>
it probably wouldn't be such trouble if it is disseminated.  However please<br>
keep all references to author intact (that I would appriciate).<br>

Since so many words are flying about this, let me add some more.<br>
The moderator of the newsgroup Soc.religion.christian said that<br>
there were still some very competent scholars who support the<br>
superiority of the Textus Receptus (in the general sense, not in<br>
the specific version of Erasmus).  Also, I think one's view of<br>
the Bible influences the discussion.  Modern (``liberal''?)<br>
scholars view the books of the Bible as having a late origin, I<br>
believe, and not representing literal truth.  I view the books<br>
as having an early origin and representing literal narratives, in<br>
general.  So this has a tremendous influence in how you look at<br>
the Bible versions.  Does  the Bible just represent the early Christian<br>
community's attempt to symbolically portray spiritual reality?  Or<br>
is it a literal narrative dating from early times?  In the former<br>
case I suppose you look for an authentic statement of the community,<br>
which could arise much later.  In the latter case you look for the<br>
earliest versions which most closely approximate the truth.  In<br>
the former case the writings of the church fathers etc. might not<br>
be relevant because they don't necessarily represent what the<br>
community thinks.  In the latter case they are evidence of what<br>
the earliest manuscripts said.  And so on ...<br>
<p>
I would like to see the basis on which the modern scholars weigh<br>
the manuscripts instead of counting them.<br>
<p>
I'd hate to have some of the apocrypha in the Bible.  I think it<br>
waters it down with some questionable material and calls its<br>
credibility into question.<br>
<p>

In response to Warren Trenchard's comments, I would recall what the<br>
Jews said about Jesus.  ``Which of the leading men have believed in<br>
Him?'' or words to that effect.  A friend of mine has looked into some<br>
of the supposed best scholars treatments of the Bible versions and<br>
found some surprising arguments.  For example, one said that historical<br>
evidence is to be discounted.  By this he means, it doesn't matter which<br>
versions the church fathers quoted or which versions appeared in<br>
early lectionaries (church services).  But, that's important evidence<br>
about the ages of the versions.  If I accepted the opinions of most<br>
leading scholars I would believe that Jesus never rose from the dead<br>
and that there is no life after death.  This includes the scholars in<br>
the leading seminaries.  I heard once that over 90 percent of the<br>
studets graduating from leading seminaries no longer believe in the<br>
literal resurrection of Christ.  This includes the new preachers in<br>
Protestant and Catholic churches, I understand.  You can imagine what<br>
influence this is having on the churches.  And, as Adventists, we<br>
are sending our seminary students to other universities to get<br>
advanced degrees, from where this kind of teaching can easily come<br>
into our own church.  So, when you understand the situation in the<br>
seminaries and universities of the land, and realize how few there<br>
are who really believe the Bible is inspired or that the miracles<br>
reported in the New Testament really occurred, it's not surprising<br>
when their opinions do not seem to accord with our perception of<br>
reality. I would also comment that in the last days, the leading<br>
men of education and culture will be supporting the mark of the<br>
beast, according to my understanding of the prophecies of the<br>
book of Revelation.  Will we follow the opinions of the leading<br>
scholars then, or the Word of God?  On the other hand, we should<br>
not discount the opinions of the scholars also, if their arguments<br>
make sense.  Thus the need to dig deeper than to say that all the<br>
leading scholars support a particular point of view.<br>

Here is a quote I found interesting...<br>
<p>
"If Adventism is not ardent evangelicalism or typical cultism then how<br>
shall it be classified? The evidence supports Dr. Lindsell's judgment<br>
that it is similar to Romanism. Like Romanism Adventism has added to<br>
the Scripture a body of tradition it seems reluctant to break. Like<br>
Romanism Adventism depreciates the completeness of Christ's work of<br>
atonement, and like Romanism Adventism adds to grace the necessity<br>
of human works as a condition of salvation. Needless to say, both<br>
Adventism and Romanism assert the deity of Christ, His atonement for<br>
sinners, and His resurrection from the dead. In other respects their<br>
systems may not be analogous except in asserting that the Pope changed<br>
the day of worship, but these are highly significant.<br>
<p>
The error of Romanism and Adventism resembles that of the Galatians."<br>
<p>
Lewis, Gordon R., "The Bible, the Christian, and Seventh-Day Adventists",<br>
    Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co., New  Jersey, 1966<br>
<p>
It's always interesting to hear the perspective of an "outsider" who<br>
has been looking in! I think the small booklet I have is actually a<br>
reprinted chapter from a larger book entitled "Confronting the Cults"<br>
by the same author.<br>
<p>
Anyone wishing to take up on any of his points will need to read the rest<br>
of his material first, since I have presented a small part of the <br>
conclusion only. His discussion was actually quite balanced, although<br>
clearly most SDAs would not like EGWs writings referred to as "tradition".<br>
That term has usually been reserved for the Catholic church.<br>
<p>
I must say, however, that in the light of the current discussion on Bible<br>
versions, there seems to be a certain portion of the SDA church which has<br>
as their creed "sola scriptura, except where it contradicts one of our<br>
previously held doctrinal beliefs, in which case it has been translated <br>
wrongly or deliberately corrupted by the Devil himself". I guess an outsider <br>
has the right to view that as "a body of tradition it seems reluctant to <br>
break"! Now I am not criticizing that creedal position, but I do think<br>
that there is a difference between "sola our interpretation of the KJV"  <br>
and "sola scriptura" which does need to be acknowledged.<br>

[Heidi Vyhmeister Grumling writes:]<br>
<i>&gt;what are we doing as individuals and as a church to make</i><br>
<i>&gt;abortion unnecessary?  What about the physical, financial, emotional support of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the women/families with unplanned pregnancies?  What about family planning?</i><br>
<i>&gt;You see, I work as a nurse-midwife at a teen clinic.  We don't do abortions,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but I provide family planning and prenatal care (among a lot of other things)</i><br>

<i>&gt;touch the issue, but we need to address it.  Some of the kids turning up in my</i><br>
<i>&gt;clinic are SDA's.</i><br>
<p>
God bless you, Heidi!  Really!  (Cf Ruth 4:11 and similar)  I have<br>
considerable concerns about the pro-lifers who picket abortion clinics<br>
because I see it as un-Christ-like, not redemptive, and at least not<br>
God's best (As for the abortion clinic bombers, they are as badly<br>
confused as those who join the KKK or Aryan organizations; they do gross,<br>
inestimable damage to God's reputation).  However, I have great respect<br>
for the evangelicals who work at crisis pregnancy centers, for families<br>
who provide home havens (physical, finanacial, emotional support).<br>
<p>
Perhaps now is a good time for this story:  When our second child was<br>
born in Minnesota, in 1981, my wife shared a room with an unmarried,<br>
19 yr old mother.  They became acquainted and kept in touch afterwards<br>
for several years.  Shortly after leaving Waconia's hospital, the room-mate<br>
called us and invited us to her baby's dedication.  So, on that Sunday, we<br>
attended her Reformed Church of America (as I recall the denomination).<br>
<p>
After the typical church service preliminaries, the pastor got up and invited<br>
Sherrie and baby Melissa (as I'll call them) to come up.  The pastor then<br>
mentioned that he'd spent time counseling and talking with Sherrie, and one<br>
of the decisions Sherrie made was that she would address the church.  Sherrie<br>
stepped up to the mike and talked about how she'd had feelings of rebellion<br>
against God, her family, etc during her high school years, how she had gotten<br>
involved with a young man as a way of escape, then finally found herself<br>
pregnant.  She then apologized to her family and her church for how she had<br>
dishonored them and especially God.  During this time, many hearts were<br>
touched with sympathy and compassion; several women (not of her family, btw)<br>
left their seats to go stand beside her, put their arms around her.  It was<br>
a moving experience.<br>
<p>
When it was time for the baby to be dedicated, the pastor spoke of the<br>
unique needs of single mothers and asked the congregation to seek out<br>
ways that they could help her (e.g., clothes, baby sitting while the<br>
mother went to school, etc).  Many hands went up.  And from our continuing<br>
contacts, many of those church members were faithful to their pledge.<br>
<p>
Amen!  And let us all be as Christ-like!<br>

Ruben,<br>
<p>
You said,<br>
<p>
Who are we to believe ? In the current ecumenical atmosphere I know who I will<br>
believe. Metzger calls Erasmus' work  "inferior" EGW endorses this same<br>
work saying it corrected the errors of the existing texts. Whom should we<br>
believe ? "<br>
<p>
Could you please provide a reference where EGW endorsed the textus receptus?<br>

<i>&gt; huh, I thought no profit meant covering all costs, but not getting rich.</i><br>
<p>
yes, but....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ie</i><br>
<i>&gt; Printers get paid,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Paper makers get paid</i><br>
<i>&gt; etc</i><br>
<p>
...and investors (without whom there would be no publishing firm) get paid,<br>

<p>
Who defines what a reasonable salary is?  Who defines what "not getting rich"<br>
means?  <br>
<p>
I bought a NIV study bible a few weeks ago and choked a bit on the $35<br>
purchase price.  But after I read it a few times I realized that it was<br>
worth every penney.  Actually, when you consider that Hundreds of scholars<br>
worked for years to put it out, its amazing that they could publish it as<br>
cheaply as they could.<br>

The Bible needs nothing added or removed to make it sell. Regardless of<br>
what translation, it is the Word of God - and comes with His power. I<br>
think Ruben had better be careful slamming those who have made a great<br>
effort to make the Bible available freely to the masses. <br>

We are now getting to the point in this discussion where everyone who has<br>
something to say has already said it several times, and the same question<br>
is being asked over and over again.  (This includes my own postings on<br>
the topic.)  Hopefully, neither side will find it necessary to RESORT TO <br>
PROOF BY ___CAPS LOCK___.  If we start moving to some application issues <br>
again we will be more likely to generate more light and less heat.<br>

Now that we've had the battle of the translations, let's get back to the<br>
topic that started all this.  We were discussing inspiration and I brought<br>
up the fact that there are translation errors so I do not believe in<br>
word inspiration of the Bible.  This essentially means that I do not<br>
believe that the ENGLISH words of the KJV or any other translation is<br>
the inspired word of God based on the actual words used.  I DO BELEIVE<br>
that it is the word of God so long as it's translated correctly.  Well<br>
how can I know when something is translated correctly or not.  This is<br>
where the essential ingredient of the Holy Spirit fits into the equation.<br>
We have all been promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to guide our lives<br>
if we truly wish that guidance and live a life that does not drive away<br>
that light, we may know from within, for ourselves, what the truth is.<br>
Does it matter if there are errors in the written word?  Isn't God<br>
faithful to His promise to lead us to light and salvation?  We don't have<br>
to depend on an ancient language scholar to dissect the truth for us.<br>
<p>
I read the pages referenced by Ruben in the GC and did not find any<br>
direct endorsement of any particular version of the Bible or any translation.<br>
What I did find on those pages was the reason Tyndale, Luther, and Wycliffe<br>
gave so much to provide scripture for the common man in his native tongue.<br>
Tyndale said:<br>
	"While I am sowing in one place, the enemy ravages the field<br>
	I have just left.  I cannot be everywhere.  Oh! if Christians<br>
	possessed the Holy Scriptures in their own tongue, they could<br>
	of themselves withstand these sophists.  Without the Bible it<br>
	is impossible to establish the laity in the truth."<br>
<p>
	"Christians must read the New Testament in their mother tongue."<br>
<p>
If this was so important and essential during the Reformation, would it<br>
not apply now to modern Christians?  Every man is better off with a least<br>
some version of scripture than no scripture at all.  Are some translations<br>
better than others?  Who really knows but does it matter?  The Holy Spirit<br>
has used incompetent and inadequate vessels to spread the truth throughout<br>
the ages.  Isn't He just as able to reveal truth to a sincere soul now?<br>
<p>
I believe the root of the translation debate has more to do with support<br>
of cherished doctrines.  If you take God's Word in any form, translation,<br>
or language, you cannot miss the essentials of salvation.  And isn't that<br>
the purpose of God's Word in the first place?<br>

THE TEXT FOR THE LAST TIME<br>
<p>
It must be obvious to everyone by now that some of us could go on forever on the issues of<br>
the text of the New Testament and the quality of the Bible Translations.  I, for one, do not<br>
intend to do so.  Having laid out my positions on some issues in this regard, with these<br>
present remarks I will rest my case, leaving the verdict of public opinion to the jury of<br>
reasonable readers.<br>
<p>
ANOTHER AUTHORITY<br>
In my reference to several contemporary authorities on New Testament textual criticism and<br>
the translations, I forgot to mention two distinguished Adventists, Sakae Kubo and Walter<br>
Specht.  Their book, So Many Versions? (Zondervan--my copy is the revised and enlarged<br>
edition of 1983), is an excellent source of information on the Bible translations of the 20th<br>
century.  With PhDs in New Testament textual criticism, they offer a well informed survey of<br>
the quality of these versions, free from superstition and supposition.  I highly recommend this<br>
easy reading book.<br>
<p>
THE MSS OF 1 JOHN 5:7-8<br>
On the question concerning the MS support of the long reading in 1 John 5:7-8, Dave J.<br>
correctly reflects the view of Metzger (A Textual Commentary . . .), writing on behalf of the<br>
whole United Bible Society's Greek New Testament editorial team.  However, it is interesting<br>
to observe that in the textual notes to this passage in both The Greek New Testament, Third<br>
Edition (Corrected) (1983) and the related Novum Testamentum Graece (1979), some<br>
additional Greek witnesses are cited as well.  These minuscules include<br>
<p>
      221  (marginal note on a 10th C. MS),<br>
      429  (marginal note on a 14-15th C. MS),<br>
      918  (16th C.), and<br>
      2318 (18th C.!).<br>
<p>
Both editions of the text also list 636 (marginal note on a 15th C. MS) rather than 635, which<br>
is listed by Metzger in both The Text of the New Testament (subtitled, Its Transmission,<br>
Corruption and Restoration) and A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament.  This<br>
is curious, since Metzger is also one of the editors of both the above mentioned editions.  I<br>
will try to remember to ask him about this monumental (?) problem, when I see him next.<br>
<p>
THE AUTHORITY OF ELLEN WHITE IN TEXTUAL CRITICISM<br>
For some, the critical ingredient in this debate seems to be the writings of Ellen White on the<br>
subject.  Let me offer an opinion on the her role in the issues of the text of the New<br>
Testament and the validity of Bible translations.  In my view, Ellen White was no more an<br>
authority on technical questions concerning Old and New Testament textual criticism and the<br>
validity of Bible translations than she was on the details of history during the Reformation<br>
and certain other periods.  The latter is confirmed by the changes to the latest edition of the<br>
Great Controversy, published during her lifetime and under her control.  She was not even an<br>
authority on the technical interpretation of the Bible.  She herself refused to allow her earlier<br>
writings on the meaning of the "daily" sacrifice in Daniel 9 to settle a dispute on the issue<br>
late in her life.  Her writings on the law in Galatians show clear evolution.  In her little<br>
known book, The Miracles of Jesus (It also appears in one of the volumes of Spirit of<br>
Prophecy.), she placed the Stilling of the Storm AFTER the Walking on the Water, contrary<br>
to the order of these events in the Synoptic Gospels.  She even mentions that the disciples<br>
should not have been afraid during the storm, since Jesus had on an earlier occasion come<br>
walking to them on the water.  However, this reflection is missing in the account in The<br>
Desire of Ages, because she relates the two incidents in the biblical order, with the Stilling<br>
coming BEFORE the Walking.  One could cite numerous such examples.  In these matters<br>
she simply appears to have reflected the views of those whom she read and with whom she<br>
associated.  It seems clear to me, therefore, that Ellen White, while fulfilling an important<br>
divinely inspired mission, was not an authority on everything she wrote, nor should we treat<br>
her as such.<br>

Fred,<br>
I stongly agree with your stance on supporting people with love what have <br>
not fully fallowed God's word.  We all have fallen at one time or another.<br>
We are all sinners and only through Christ can we be saved and helped to<br>
over come those disires.  So with this in mine I think that it is so<br>
stupid the way people are so judgmental about fornication.  I feel sex<br>
sters people up more than any other topic!  (Probibly out of guilt at<br>
times)  <br>
<p>
What makes fornication any diffrent than any other sin?  So why don't<br>
people accept them as they do other sinners and help them stay in God's<br>
hospital called the "church"?<br>
<p>
I have come from a conservitive home.  SDA all my life.  I am currently a<br>
first year student at Union and am takeing Theology and Business Adm.  But<br>
that does not change my nature.  <br>
<p>
Though Chirst all things are posible.  I agree that through Christ we can<br>
help to suppress a lot of sexual thoughts and desires.  By focusing time<br>
on God rather than pornographic material.  But at the same time when you <br>
get into a relationship that changes really quick.  You let your hormons<br>
take over and don't keep God in your heart.  At least in many cases, such<br>
as the one I just got out of a week ago.  If you had asked me at<br>
Christmass time if I thought fornication was wrong.  I would have said,<br>
Biblicly yes.  But if asked if I would have sex out side of marriage I<br>
would have again answered yes.  Just because person knows something is<br>
wrong, doesn't mean that they are allowing Christ to work.  It usely means<br>
that they are letting their bodys control themselves.<br>
<p>
I have found a text in 1 Thes. 4:3 ". . . that you should avoid sexual<br>
immorality; that each of you should learn to control his own body...."<br>
NIV<br>
<p>
This text I feel shoud be the whole key to the SDA aproch to teaching<br>
youth aobut sexuality and control.  As I have strugled with the temptation<br>
of having sex I have come to realize that today there are two extreams. <br>
1. the TV and secular socity says that it's ok to have sex.  Just have<br>
safer sex.  (or they say that if you decide too, than use this...  good..<br>
but gives the impression of permition.)  and 2.  A very legalistic stance<br>
by most churches saying not to have sex.  <br>
<p>
As I strugled through the Bible on this and lots of prayer, I came to a<br>
conclution.  That even thought God says no I was going to go ahaid and do<br>
it any ways.  (Through discutions with my girlfriend at the time, we<br>
decided not to...  How I hated it then!  But now I'm still wishing we had.<br>
 But I'm sure when I get maried I will be glad that I waited!  But for<br>
now--my hormons are still yelling at me...)  I FELT THAT SINCE I COULDN'T<br>
FIND ANY WAYS IN THE BIBLE TO TURN OFF 100% THAT TEMPTATION AND A WAY FOR<br>
GOD TO TURN OFF HORMONS THROUGH PRAYER, THAT I WAS GOING TO BE SELFISH AND<br>
DO IT ANY WAYS.  <br>
<p>
I am still very torn on this issue!!!!  I feel that the SDA church really<br>
needs to teach  youth how to control their bodies.  The text says to, so<br>
how do we?  (for me I started using a medication for a rash in a location<br>
south of my belly butten and found that it helped to cool things off for<br>
many hours:)  I have often thought of asking the doctor for a medication<br>
to turn of my sexual drive....:)   But through continual focus on God and<br>
from doing his service we can over come this nagging problem.  BUT!  Youth<br>
need hard answers!  ( I have alwasy heard the birds and the bees and then<br>
I heard aobut conterceptives.  And you hear about the results of having<br>
sex--unwanted pregnancy.  But you never really hear about how to control<br>
our bodys (they say well don't get into that situation where you will want<br>
to make out..  that is good--but to make the decition to be in that place<br>
you have already decided what you are wanting to do.  it must come before<br>
that.))  <br>
<p>
As many might tell.  This is a very strong issue for me.  I am trying to<br>
lead a life of God.  Since Chirstmass I have asked God to forgive my<br>
stupidness for out right wanting to ignor His commands.  But I still<br>
haven't found 100% of the answers.    (maybe about50% though:)    <br>
<p>
With TV, and our hormons, God is hard to hear.  Today people need to hear<br>
firm principles of how to have a continual relationship with God, basicly<br>
a courtship, to have as our shield and mastor Chimist.<br>
<p>
Last week when I broke up--sex was the last thing on earth I wanted.  Yet<br>
tonight I was having a discution about condoms and such with a friend of<br>
mine that is a female.  How quickly Satan can break back in!<br>
<p>
<p>
Legalizem and secularism won't work to fight Satan or sexual temptation. <br>
Only a ballenced life in the service of God.  But that is so hard to live!<br>
<p>

A friend of ours has recently been diagnosed as having Multiple Scheloris.<br>
I'd guess she is in her 50s or early 60s.<br>
She had been to a lot of doctors because of her symptoms, finally<br>
referred to the top M.S. doctor in the NW.  MRI scans etc and its<br>
now confirmed.<br>
<p>
Based on her history of symptoms, the doctor concluded that she has<br>
had it since childhood.  His question was: "you should be dead by now,<br>
what have you been eating?"   Her reply was that she has been a<br>
vegetarian since the age of 2.  He broke out into a broad smile,<br>
commenting that is the diet he puts his patients on.  He is not SDA.  <br>
She will be one of his special study cases to help confirm the doctors<br>
diet theories, especially with regards to vegies.<br>

Well, well, for once I agree with Ruben on something!  I also do not<br>
think that people should get rich selling Bibles or any other article<br>
of religion.  Guess how this makes me feel about the way we run our<br>
literature evangelism work?  No, I realize that most L.E.s are not<br>
rich -- on the contrary, they sometimes are starving because they<br>
rely on commission and the books are so over-priced that almost nobody<br>
can afford to buy them anymore!  When will the higher-ups see that if<br>
we really want to spread the Good News, then we must make it affordable.<br>
I'm for putting L.E.s on salary and lowering the price of the books<br>
to within reach of at least the middle class, if not lower!<br>

[From Kwong-hoon Andrew Park of University of Manitoba   SCT]<br>
Hi,<br>
<p>
I just cam from the geology class and I (as a general<br>
christian) was cornered today.  A lot of them was emotional<br>
I guess, but the one I had trouble was when he said the following.<br>
<p>
	"If Noah's flood story is right, then wouldn't it be<br>
more reasonable when we see the biogeographical data, we'll<br>
find more animals in the area of Mt. Araret than anywhere else<br>
because it's where all the animals (survived ones) came."<br>
<p>
Well, how do you explain that.  <br>
BTW, Please I didn't like the space ship eden theory.<br>
I'm one of the person who believes that there's gotta be a <br>
scientific way of proving that creationism is right.<br>
<p>
Well, thanks in advance.<br>
<p>
[Much as I might like to stop this thread, I can't because I did start <br>
this discussion.  Please remember that SDAnet is not meant to repeat the <br>
tired debate about creationism that goes on other nets, and this is stated<br>
clearly in the charter.  I'll choose not to speak to the question<br>
"there's gotta be a scientific way of proving that creationism is right"<br>
and <br>
encourage others to confine themselves to the specific issue that was <br>
raised.  SCT]<br>

Here are 14 locations listed for Erasmus I found in the EGW CD-ROM.  I have<br>
not included the text at this time.  I have the text available if anyone<br>
would like it.  Just email me your request and I'll send it to you.<br>

</ul>
<!-- body="start" -->
It seems to me that the church has historically followed a forensic <br>
approach to sex by emphasizing what happens if you "get caught."<br>
While this approach has plenty of Biblical support, I think an additional<br>
emphasis is necessary.  We have to show people what either sex or the desire<br>
for it is doing to their relationships on a day by day basis.  If they can't<br>
see how they are hurting themselves on a daily basis, the fear of<br>
getting caught won't matter to them either, nor will the threat of hell<br>
fire.<br>
<p>
Some general principles I try to live by (fortunately there are no<br>
ex-girlfriends of mine on the net to tell you differently):<br>
<p>
1)  In my relationships I should see the beauty of my partner<br>
    as something to be preserved and protected.<br>
<p>
2)  I'm not ready to be with the special *someone* until I don't have<br>
    the urge to be with just *anyone*  (In other words, you're not ready<br>
    to live together until you're able to live alone.)<br>
<p>
3)  Intimacy is a expression of love to the partner, not something to be <br>
    extracted from the partner.<br>
<p>
4)  If you have to scheme about how to convince your partner to perform<br>
    an act, you're probably not ready to do that.<br>
<p>
5)  If you are working closely with someone else towards a common goal,<br>
    particularly if prayer is involved, a relationship will develop<br>
    whether you want it to or not.  Plan before you relate.<br>
<p>
6)  Physical and emotional attachment should not precede the general building<br>
    of common ground in a relationship.  <br>
<p>
7)  I have found it interesting to have a person that knows both people in <br>
    the couple talk with them about how they relate to people.  For several <br>
    of my engaged or quasi-engaged friends I have pointed  out things they <br>
    hadn't noticed about their partner.  Though I am not now nor have I <br>
    ever been engaged, I have benefitted from the advice of other people<br>
    pointing out behaviors I never knew I was doing.<br>

Just wanted to thank Scott for his plain, honest comment.  Being 38 and<br>
single I've struggled with the same things that he has and there is<br>
nothing harder to deal with.  Scott's idea's about giving it all to God<br>
are right, but it still doesn't make it any easier.<br>
<p>
Hang in there and keep trusting in God.  That's what I have chosen to do.<br>

I have a friend who is looking for work as a teacher or<br>
translator.  His Ph.D. is in Chinese literature but he is<br>
also fluent in German.  He has lived and taught in Taiwan,<br>
knows a lot about Chinese history, and is a committed SDA<br>
Christian.  An American citizen, he has traveled extensively<br>
and is currently living in New Mexico.  If you know of any<br>
opportunities for this exceptional individual, please send<br>
me whatever information you can and I will pass it on.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>

Models such as the "spaceship Eden" model sit at the interface of science<br>
and religion and thus are often accused of being neither scientific nor<br>
religious.  There are various levels of intervention by God and various<br>
levels of testability these imply.<br>
<p>
The first we may call "pernicious intervention."  This would include<br>
creating the world a few weeks ago with a remembered past.  Other examples<br>
would be placing fossils in the rocks to give false appearance of age,<br>
or creating stars a large distance away with their light on its way to us<br>
so we would get it within 6000 years.  If we choose to make religious <br>
postulates of this type  (I do not think we should), then we must also <br>
believe that observation of the natural world is likely to give the<br>
wrong answers.  Although it is not wise to postulate that such things<br>
have <br>
happened, an omnipotent God certainly could do any of these things.<br>
<p>
The second we call "gap theory" which suggests that the time between<br>
"In the beginning God" and "Let there be light" was long.  This <br>
opens the door to much scientific testability but leads one down a <br>
slippery slope in scriptural interpretation.<br>
<p>
The third type of intervention is actions which may not be observable<br>
from the evidence now but were certainly observable at the time and <br>
would not have violated any laws of nature.  The Flood is a violent<br>
singularity which would fit into this category.  Rowland's Spaceship <br>
Eden model is a similar idea which is not currently testable because<br>
we do not have the Garden of Eden with which to experiment.<br>
<p>
The fourth type of intervention is creation _ex nihilo_.  The method<br>
by which God creates a subatomic particle is well understood, and doing<br>
more complex systems is in principle an engineering task.  In practice<br>
it involves processes so complex that we do not know whether any physical<br>
laws are violated or not.  (And if these laws are only violated for<br>
a short period of time, we could never tell anyway.)  <br>
<p>
It's my personal prejudice that God always operates within the laws of <br>
nature, and that in fact the laws of nature are another representation <br>
of the law of God.  The caveat is that we do not know what all these laws<br>
may be.<br>
<p>
We should not be in a hurry to mesh our belief to the current scientific<br>
belief.  The Catholics tied their belief to the writings of Aristotle and <br>
were thus forced to condemn Galileo for suggesting the earth goes around<br>
the sun.  Only late last year did they forgive him for speaking against<br>
the church (more than 300 years later.)<br>

</ul>
<!-- body="start" -->
After reading the various messages about sex, I have a few questions<br>
to pose.<br>
<p>
1.  Where is our church when it comes to teaching our teenagers about sex?<br>
<p>
  The reasons for this question come several sources.  My parents are both<br>
doctors and at times in the past I have been employed in their offices.<br>
It surprized me to find that the ratio of SDA teenage girls to girls from<br>
the rest of the community who came who came in with the "flu" and went out<br>
knowing that they were pregnant.  Most often the SDA girls commented that<br>
they had not realized that they could get pregnant from their activities.<br>
This was generaly not the case with girls from the community. They knew<br>
what they were doing, for the most part, but had figured one time<br>
unprotected wouldn't get them pregnant.<br>
  Also I had a chat with a young lady in a youth sabbath school class a<br>
few summers ago that still bothers me.  She was the kind of person who<br>
was generally happy and smiling.  On this particular Saturday morning<br>
she was pretty destracted and seemed upset.  I asked a few questions and<br>
eventually found that she had had sex with a young man in the city park<br>
the night before.  When I told that she had had sex, she said that no,<br>
that couldn't have happened to her, she wasn't that kind of person.  The<br>
point being, she didn't even know what sex was!  She was from a good,<br>
functional SDA family and was a pretty straight person, but no one had<br>
ever taken the time to explain the facts of life to her.<br>
  Perhaps I should reword the question.  Perhaps it should be, <br>
<p>
What responsiblity does our church, as a whole, have toward making sure<br>
our youth know about sex.<br>
<p>
2.  Do we, as a church, do ourselves a disservice with the victorian view<br>
    we take of sex out side of marriage?<br>
<p>
  This is a personal experience type question and by stating it, I'm not<br>
suggesting that we condone sex outside of marriage.  Here is how it worked<br>
with me: I was brought up hearing that sex was bad.  I heard this more <br>
from teachers and other adults who were uncomfortable with a 10 year old<br>
who read his parents anatomy and gynecology books then from my parents.<br>
When I actually had sex, I found that, physically, it was a great deal of<br>
fun.  And being at the age where being a little rebellion was "Cool" I<br>
tried to have it as much as I could.  And when I got caught, all I heard<br>
from the church was that I had sinned and was evil and should repent.<br>
But to my rebellious eye, there was nothing wrong with my activitys.  So,<br>
I just said "To hell with the church."  But I'm not a very good rebel.<br>
And I tormented myself with what I had done being evil.  Problem was, I<br>
still liked sex, still do.  But after having it, I would have a massive<br>
guilt trip.  It took a somewhat drunk Baptist girl to point out to me that<br>
God didn't want to roast me if I slipped.  But I still have a lot of<br>
mental baggage from those days.  And I still have hard feeling toward<br>
the church on this issue.  The point of all this is that I wasn't able<br>
to be morally stable until I figured out that God doesn't blast you<br>
forever if you fail.  Why couldn't the church have said as much.<br>
<p>
Which brings me to:<br>
<p>
3.  Is it possible to have a very close relationship, outside of marriage,<br>
    that does not include sex.<br>
<p>
  My girl friend and I are presently dealing with this one.  She knows my<br>
background and has had her own experiences.  So we have always tried to<br>
base our relationship on the non-physical aspects of being close to <br>
someone.  Also, we have developed a set of guidelines and placed some<br>
mental no trespassing signs on pertinant areas of the human anatomy.  I<br>
suppose the best thing we have that has kept us from destroying our<br>
relationship (by allowing it to become purely physical) is mutual trust.<br>
We both assume the responsibility of saying No.  And we both trust the<br>
other person to keep a lid on the sex drive.  Is it easy?  NO!  Will it<br>
last?  I hope so.  Would our system work without us both agreeing to it?<br>
I doubt it.  Believe me, there are times when it takes the both of us<br>
to keep out of trouble.  Finally, you'll note that God isn't mentioned<br>
in this paragraph until now.  That's because you aren't thinking about<br>
Him when you are all hot and bothered.  God comes in before, (Give me<br>
strength Lord.) and after, (Thanks for Your power to resist.) but not<br>
during unless you are an exceptional person.<br>
<p>
In closing, I know that I would have the problems I had in #2 above<br>
knowing what I know now.  But where was the church when I didn't know?<br>
Does the church promote, mention, or even suggest anything like #3?<br>
And why is it that when something comes up of the sexual nature, our<br>
church family seems to follow the words of a song:<br>
<p>
		"Two hearts get entangled<br>
		 Dirty minds, they go to town<br>
		 Everyone's got an angle<br>
		 Little lies get spread around"<br>

This has been done.  The New King James version, is a superbly readable<br>
bible, and was quite fairly handled.<br>

This is a subject that comes up frequently in the youth class I teach.  <br>
Several of our young people have decisions to make on a regular basis,<br>
and it seems that so far they have made wise decisions.  Twice now<br>
I have invited Heidi Grumling (nurse midwife/pregnancy counselor/<br>
sometime contributor to this net) to talk with my class.  <br>
<p>
Whenever she comes to visit, she brings a bunch of pamphlets about various <br>
stuff  (birth control, avoiding disease, etc.)  But most of the questions <br>
don't center around this technical information.  They're more interested <br>
in the human interest stories, how young Chicago teenagers cope with this <br>
problem, etc.<br>
<p>
At one point this statement would not have been true, but now it is true<br>
that the young people are getting enough information about the plumbing.<br>
(They are also getting misinformation from their friends, and that needs to <br>
be countered.)  What is needed is emotional preparation to be willing to <br>
make the tough choices they will have to make, and decide before trouble <br>
happens that they aren't going to get into it.  Because, lets face it,<br>
even *inside* marriage there's a lot of people that still aren't emotionally<br>
ready for intimacy.<br>
<p>
In my last post I said we need to help young people see what their attitudes<br>
and actions are doing to themselves, but I didn't say what that was.<br>
I need help putting that into words.  <br>

One aspect of this topic that has not been mentioned is the<br>
influence of our diet and health practices on our sex drive.<br>
I believe that the health counsels of Ellen White, if followed,<br>
would do a lot towards helping us to keep this under control.<br>
A simple, natural diet helps to restrain the ``animal passions.''<br>
Also, I think getting plenty of sunlight  helps to milden our<br>
disposition, and outdoor exercise has a similar effect.<br>
High fat and sugar and protein intake tends to have the opposite<br>
effect.  I can't give scientific evidence for this but it has<br>
been borne out in my own experience and seems to be supported<br>
by the testimonies of Sister White.  There seems to be a<br>
similar correlation with the control of temper.  Of course,<br>
this doesn't mean that the temptation will go away.<br>

<i>&gt; I was reading one of Rubens messages this morning and saw a very interesting</i><br>

<i>&gt; we are only able to claim salvation by keeping the commandments. (This is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; paraphrase and if I am wrong feel free to correct me Ruben)  </i><br>
<p>
I have previously discussed this some time ago, and those who remember will <br>
know that this is not the case. I do not believe in salvation by works.<br>
<p>
Salvation is by faith alone, however faith = trust and obey. So that<br>
the saving faith is that faith that obeys. For this reason the translation<br>
of Rev 22:14 is correct because it exemplifies that type of faith necessary<br>
for salvation. For this very reason Rev 22:14 (KJV style) is unpopular<br>

Lola,<br>
This price-lowering of books and change in employment conditions of literature<br>
evangelists is happening in Australia, starting around now. I don't know<br>
what all the details are but the system is based on what has been very<br>
successfully trialed in South Africa (I think it is South Africa anyway).<br>

concerning sex,<br>
<p>
Dear Steve,<br>
<p>
     in your last message, you said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In my last post I said we need to help young people see what their attitudes</i><br>
<i>&gt;and actions are doing to themselves, but I didn't say what that was.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I need help putting that into words.</i><br>
<p>
     Perhaps, we need to help our people (not just young people, who<br>
seem to be always regarded with suspicion with respect to such matters) be<br>
aware of WHAT their attitudes are.<br>
<p>
     As we near the close of the age, the world gets morally more and<br>
more corrupt. I personally feel that a lot of it is thanks to the mass<br>
media, which seem to be getting more and more corrupting in their<br>
influence. Here in Singapore, the formerly "strict" censorship of films<br>
and TV is getting more liberal suddenly and exposing our people to even<br>
stronger immoral influences, and this has an adverse effect on the moral<br>
norms of society. Even before this, the kinds of ideals and norms and<br>
role-models portrayed in the media in things like soap operas and such,<br>
were very different from Christian ideals and principles. The media would<br>
have us believe, for example, that it is good and normal for young<br>
children to have boy-girl relationships of a type not befitting their<br>
level of maturity. Now lots of kids in school are obsessed with having<br>
boyfriends or girlfriends. When I was a kid of 12 or 13, which wasn't<br>
that long ago, I remember that we were interested in such things too,<br>
but not to the same extent.<br>
<p>
     Well, as society degenerates, we as God's people need to guard our<br>
ideas and thoughts because of the very subtle and pervasive non-Christian<br>
influences which surround us. While we are in the world, let us take care<br>
NOT to revert back to being of the world.<br>
<p>
     How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to<br>
(God's) word. -Ps 119:9<br>
<p>
     The best answer to avoid getting the wrong attitudes is to spend<br>
time with God in prayer and bible-study and to strengthen our faith by<br>
Christian fellowship. We are influenced, to a degree, by all with whom<br>
we choose to associate. Let us then associate with Jesus so that we will<br>
benefit from the influence of His character, and perhaps thereby influence<br>
our peers.<br>
<p>
     Also, if one really wants to live a life of self-control amidst<br>
the temptations to impurity, it is necessary not to expose oneself<br>
unnecessarily to temptations. While we draw on the resources of divine <br>
strength to fight temptation, we should not go where we are not called to <br>
go and where we know there will be a bad influence. To do that is just<br>
asking for it, we are week and we will fall. For example, we should<br>
choose what we watch on TV and what sorts of literature we read. A lot<br>
of people say they can watch "adult" films because they are adults and<br>
are able to decide what to see and they are mature enough to know the <br>
difference between right and wrong. As far as I'm concerned, if something<br>
is considered morally unfit for children to watch or read, I don't want to<br>
see it either. Actually, even the stuff the world considers to be o.k.<br>
for childrens' consumption is riddled with unchristian messages and ideas.<br>
<p>
     Well, just my two-cents worth on this matter.<br>
<p>
     regards,<br>
<p>
     Beng Tang, Singapore.<br>

The question about Ellen White and prophecy points to a common misconception <br>
about prophecy. We tend to always think of prophecy in terms of prediction. If<br>
 <br>
one studies prophecy and prophets in scripture, I think you will find that <br>
prophets communicate messages from God to man. Many prophets never predicted <br>
anything. Predictions within prophecy come only as they relate to a specific <br>
message and usually in a conditional manner, i.e. if you don't change your <br>
course then this will be the result.<br>
 <br>
Ed Fargusson (Compuserve 72450,2430)<br>
<p>
Two points.  Some folk think prophets make only prophecies (predictions<br>
of the future); however, my understanding is that a prophet is one who<br>
has a message from God (which can include stuff about the future); and,<br>
yes, EGW did write a lot of what could be considered commentary.<br>
 <br>
Two, there's always the classic link between tobacco, certain foods,<br>
and cancer which she talked about years before it was accepted by<br>
the general population.<br>

Excerpts from mail: 9-Feb-93  by TANG BENG YONG@nusunix2. 
&gt; 
&gt;Dear Link Hudson,
&gt; 
&gt;You said:
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;I have read that the SDA's consider Ellen G. White to be a prophetess.
&gt;&gt;Did she give any prophecies or just write Bible commentary. have any of her
&gt;&gt;prophecies come true?
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Link Hudson.
&gt; 
&gt;     Well, first of all, we have to understand what a prophet is. 
&gt; 
&gt;THE MEANING OF "PROPHET"
&gt;------------------------
&gt;Nowadays, the word "prophet" connotes a person who foretells future events.
&gt;However, when used in the bible, it has a much broader meaning. The words
&gt;translated as  "prophet"  and  "prophetess"  in the bible, correspond to
&gt;the Hebrew words  "nabi"  and  "nebiah"  and to the Greek  "prophetes" 
&gt;and "prophetis" respectively. It denotes someone who has been specially
&gt;called by God, to speak on His behalf, to represent Him before His people
&gt;and to convey His messages, His will to them. The bible often says that
&gt;"the word of the LORD came to"  such and such a prophet and they usually
&gt;prefix their messages with a "Thus saith the LORD". (By contrast, the
&gt;main function of a priest is to represent the people before God).
&gt;     As such, although God often gives prophets messages to pass on to
&gt;people about future events, this is just part of their role, and perhaps
&gt;not even the main one at that. Of Moses, it is written:
&gt; 
&gt;     "And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,
&gt;      whom the LORD knew face to face," Deut 34:10
&gt; 
&gt;and yet the prediction of future events was a comparatively small part of
&gt;his function.
&gt; 
&gt;     And when he gave the excuse that he was too tongue-tied to speak to
&gt;pharaoh, God appointed Aaron to be Moses' spokesman, and this is how He
&gt;put it:
&gt; 
&gt;     "And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to
&gt;      Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet."
&gt;      Exod 7:1
&gt; 
&gt;So, Moses was the prophet of God and Aaron was the prophet of Moses in
&gt;this case. This gives us an idea of the meaning of the word.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;DO SDAs CONSIDER ELLEN WHITE TO HAVE BEEN A PROPHETESS?
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------
&gt;     Now, how about Ellen G. White? Although she did not use the word
&gt;"prophet" to refer to herself, she did claim to have been given specific
&gt;messages from God to convey to the Seventh-day Adventist church mainly,
&gt;to the world at large also, and to certain individuals. This, together
&gt;with the fact that she possessed the characteristics given in the bible,
&gt;of a true prophet of God, has led to SDAs calling her a prophet.
&gt; 
&gt;THE TESTS OF A TRUE PROPHET
&gt;---------------------------
&gt;     The bible plainly states that there will be false teachers and false
&gt;prophets going around and deceiving people.  We all know that this is
&gt;nothing new. The question now is, how do you tell a true prophet from a
&gt;fake one?
&gt;     Time does not permit me to go into all of this in detail, if you're
&gt;interested, do let me know, and we can discuss it another time. Here is
&gt;just some of the guidelines about prophets from the bible:
&gt; 
&gt;Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
&gt;Abstain from all appearance of evil. 1Thess 5:20-22
&gt; 
&gt;To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word,
&gt;it is because there is no light in them. Isa 8:20
&gt; 
&gt;Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Matt 7:20
&gt; 
&gt;And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD
&gt;will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a
&gt;dream. Num 12:6
&gt; 
&gt;For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of
&gt;God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. 2Pe 1:21
&gt; 
&gt;Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are
&gt;of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby
&gt;know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ
&gt;is come in the flesh is of God: And every spirit that confesseth not that
&gt;Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit
&gt;of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now
&gt;already is it in the world. 1 Jn 4:1-3
&gt; 
&gt;If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth
&gt;thee a sign or a wonder, And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof
&gt;he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast
&gt;not known, and let us serve them; Thou shalt not hearken unto the words
&gt;of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth
&gt;you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and
&gt;with all your soul. Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him,
&gt;and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him,
&gt;and cleave unto him. Deut 13:1-4
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;HAVE ANY OF ELLEN WHITE'S PROPHECIES COME TRUE?
&gt;-----------------------------------------------
&gt;By that I assume you mean her predictions of future events. Well yes,
&gt;as a matter of fact, most of them have come true (those that haven't
&gt;are either in the process of happening right now, or are yet future.)
&gt;     One example which I found very striking was this: A few years back,
&gt;I had just bought a book about Ellen White and the gift of prophecy, and
&gt;was reading its first chapter in my room.
&gt;     Apparently, Mrs White had said in 1902: "Not long hence, these
&gt;cities will suffer under the judgements of God. San Francisco and
&gt;Oakland are becoming as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the Lord will visit
&gt;them in wrath." - Manuscript 114, 1902. And again, in 1906, she said:
&gt;"I am bidden to declare the message that cities full of transgression,
&gt;and sinful in the extreme, will be destroyed by earthquakes, by fire,
&gt;by flood. All the world will be warned that there is a God who will
&gt;display His authority." - Manuscript 35, 1906. And just two days
&gt;BEFORE the great San Francisco earthquake and fire of April 18, 1906
&gt;she was shown this in a dream:
&gt; 
&gt;"..there passed before me a most wonderful representation. During a
&gt;vision of the night, I stood on an eminence, from which I could see
&gt;houses shaken like a reed in the wind. Buildings, great and small,
&gt;were falling to the ground. Pleasure resorts, theaters, hotels, and
&gt;the homes of the wealthy were shaken and shattered. Many lives were
&gt;blotted out of existence, and the air was filled with the shrieks of
&gt;the injured and the terrified.
&gt;     "The destroying angels of God were at work. One touch, and
&gt;buildings so thoroughly constructed that men regarded them as secure
&gt;against every danger, quickly became heaps of rubbish. There was no
&gt;assurance of safety in any place. I did not feel in any special peril,
&gt;but the awfulness of the scenes that passed before me I cannot find
&gt;words to describe. It seemed that the forbearance of God was exhausted,
&gt;and that the judgment day had come.
&gt;     "The angel that stood by my side then instructed me that but few
&gt;have any conception of the wickedness existing in our world to-day, and
&gt;especially the wickedness in the large cities. He declared that the Lord
&gt;has appointed a time when He will visit transgressors in wrath for
&gt;persistent disregard of His law.
&gt;     "Terrible as was the representation that passed before me, that
&gt;which impressed itself most vividly upon my mind was the instruction
&gt;given me in connection with it. The angel that stood by my side declared
&gt;that God's supreme rulership, and the sacredness of His law, must be
&gt;revealed to those who persistently refuse to render obedience to the
&gt;King of kings. Those who choose to remain disloyal, must be visited in
&gt;mercy with judgments, in order that, if possible, they may be aroused
&gt;to a realization of the sinfulness of their course."
&gt; 
&gt;"Awakening from this vision, she turned on the light. It was 1:00 a.m.
&gt;on Monday April 16, 1906. Four years earlier in 1902, she had first
&gt;predicted the destruction of San Francisco. Within 53 hours, it was
&gt;to take place." The book want on to say that: "490 city blocks were
&gt;destroyed; 256000 were left homeless. Mercifully only 498 died. Property
&gt;was destroyed at the rate of $1000000 every 10 minutes by the earthquake
&gt;and the fire which followed it which burned at times with blast-furnace
&gt;heat, ranging up to 2000F.  Yet she later warned of still more
&gt;destruction in the future upon these and other wicked cities.
&gt;     "The light given to me is that the wickedness in the cities of
&gt;San Francisco and Oakland is beyond all imagination. God's wrath is
&gt;upon many of the inhabitants of these cities." - Manuscript 25, 1908
&gt;     "These things make me feel very solemn, because I know that the
&gt;judgement day is right upon us. The judgements that have already come
&gt;are a warning, but not the finishing, of the punishment that will come
&gt;on wicked cities." - letter 154, 1906.
&gt;     "I feel sure that San Francisco and Oakland will again be visited
&gt;with the judgements of God" - Letter 2, 1909.
&gt;     Seismology was yet in its infancy. But warnings given then are
&gt;recognised today by leading scientists as facts to be fulfilled again
&gt;along the San Andreas Fault.
&gt;     When a prophet speaks, it comes to pass.
&gt; 
&gt;     The reason I found this so striking was that just as I was reading
&gt;this, the program on the BBC world service radio, which was playing in
&gt;my room, was interrupted for a newsflash. It said that quite a bad
&gt;earthquake had just hit San Francisco and Oakland. Later, more details
&gt;about the damage and the double-tier highway bridge collapsing came in.
&gt;When you read about a prophecy and it comes true just as you read it, it
&gt;is very striking! Anyway, after that one, I think there have been a few
&gt;other earthquakes around that region, but according to scientists, the
&gt;big one is yet to strike.
&gt; 
&gt;     There are numerous other predictions which have come true, and some
&gt;which are happening right now, if you want to know more about them, I
&gt;could recommend you some books about it. Appart from this Ellen White
&gt;wrote very widely on topics such as health, family life, etc. She has
&gt;written some very good books on the Christian Life and the life of Jesus
&gt;too. They give you good insights into the bible and make inspiring
&gt;devotional reading too.
&gt; 
&gt;     God bless,
&gt;               Beng Yong Tang, Singapore.

Where does this definition of faith come from ("faith=trust &amp; obey")?  I have<br>
read that the Greek word for faith is the same Greek word for believe, but one<br>
is a noun and the other is a verb.  So if faith is "believing" then how does<br>
trust and obediance fit into the definition?<br>
<p>
To me salvation at its simplest form is accepting Christ into your life and then<br>
from that day onward, developing the relationship with him.  If one is truely<br>
seeking to develop this relationship, then how on earth can Christ reject you?<br>
I also believe that any true relationship will exhibit actions that fall into<br>
line with God's requests.  But these actions (obediance to God's law, etc) come<br>
as a _result_ of this relationship, and not the cause for or the method of<br>
achieving the relationship.  If the actions are not exhibited, then more work is<br>
required at developing the relationship (prayer, Bible study, communion with God<br>
in nature, etc), not at working harder on keeping the law thru obedience.  You<br>
will fail at this later approach.<br>

Probably the two biggest factors in the temptation for teens to engage in<br>
sexual activity are peer pressure and poor self-esteem.  Many young people<br>
give into temptation because they don't feel very good about themselves.<br>
Sexual experiences give them the false impression that somebody cares about<br>
them.  This is from the young lady's view.  I'm not sure if this is a factor<br>
with the young men.  When young people are taught that they are magnificent<br>
creatures, made in the image of God, and worth enough to God for Jesus to<br>
redeem us, the develop healthier attitudes about who they are.  Unfortunately,<br>
many homes are dysfunctional and the parents are not able to convey love and<br>
trust so young people don't really get healthy attitudes about who they are.<br>
<p>
"In the olden days" when I was a teen, we were taught not to have sex because:<br>
	1.  You might get VD<br>
	2.  You might get pregnant<br>
	3.  You won't have a normal sex life in marriage<br>
These scare tactics don't work.  I like the approach the LDS Church uses now.<br>
(Actually, they've always used this.)  Young people should no engage in<br>
premarital sex so they can be worthy of a temple marriage.  Having a temple<br>
marriage is declares to the world that the couple has saved themselves for<br>
their future spouse and they have victoriously overcome sexual temptation.<br>
<p>
Many teens engage in sexual activity along with drugs or alcohol.  So the<br>
sexual activity is actually a component of their rebellion.  Why do so many<br>
teens get pregnant even when birth control is very available now days?  First,<br>
many won't buy it because it indicates pre-meditated sin.  Others rationalize<br>
that if they aren't on birth control, they might use that as their "excuse" to<br>
say no.<br>
<p>
I think the best thing any religion can do for their teens is to help them<br>
feel good about themselves and teach them that it's healthy and OK to say NO!<br>
Many young ladies find themselves in a pickle.  They don't want to have sex<br>
but they're having trouble saying NO.  I think it would be really great if<br>
we had "hotlines" to allow young people to call and get help before they<br>
succomb.  They could be offered suportive advice in how to say no, the easiest<br>
way to do it, how to avoid situations where they will feel trapped.  Much is<br>
the sexual tempation arrives after other standards of behavior have already<br>
been violated.  The couple is alone, unchaparoned, at a home where the parents<br>
are gone for the evening, or in a situation where they can get enough privacy<br>
.  If young people were taught to avoid these situations, that staying with<br>
people, other couples, away from secluded situtations, they may not have to<br>
face the temptation of saying no.<br>
<p>
That's my two bits.<br>
<p>

concerning sex,<br>
<p>
Dear Steve,<br>
<p>
     in your last message, you said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In my last post I said we need to help young people see what their attitudes</i><br>
<i>&gt;and actions are doing to themselves, but I didn't say what that was.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I need help putting that into words.</i><br>
<p>
     Perhaps, we need to help our people (not just young people, who<br>
seem to be always regarded with suspicion with respect to such matters) be<br>
aware of WHAT their attitudes are.<br>
<p>
     As we near the close of the age, the world gets morally more and<br>
more corrupt. I personally feel that a lot of it is thanks to the mass<br>
media, which seem to be getting more and more corrupting in their<br>
influence. Here in Singapore, the formerly "strict" censorship of films<br>
and TV is getting more liberal suddenly and exposing our people to even<br>
stronger immoral influences, and this has an adverse effect on the moral<br>
norms of society. Even before this, the kinds of ideals and norms and<br>
role-models portrayed in the media in things like soap operas and such,<br>
were very different from Christian ideals and principles. The media would<br>
have us believe, for example, that it is good and normal for young<br>
children to have boy-girl relationships of a type not befitting their<br>
level of maturity. Now lots of kids in school are obsessed with having<br>
boyfriends or girlfriends. When I was a kid of 12 or 13, which wasn't<br>
that long ago, I remember that we were interested in such things too,<br>
but not to the same extent.<br>
<p>
     Well, as society degenerates, we as God's people need to guard our<br>
ideas and thoughts because of the very subtle and pervasive non-Christian<br>
influences which surround us. While we are in the world, let us take care<br>
NOT to revert back to being of the world.<br>
<p>
     How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to<br>
(God's) word. -Ps 119:9<br>
<p>
     The best answer to avoid getting the wrong attitudes is to spend<br>
time with God in prayer and bible-study and to strengthen our faith by<br>
Christian fellowship. We are influenced, to a degree, by all with whom<br>
we choose to associate. Let us then associate with Jesus so that we will<br>
benefit from the influence of His character, and perhaps thereby influence<br>
our peers.<br>
<p>
     Also, if one really wants to live a life of self-control amidst<br>
the temptations to impurity, it is necessary not to expose oneself<br>
unnecessarily to temptations. While we draw on the resources of divine <br>
strength to fight temptation, we should not go where we are not called to <br>
go and where we know there will be a bad influence. To do that is just<br>
asking for it, we are week and we will fall. For example, we should<br>
choose what we watch on TV and what sorts of literature we read. A lot<br>
of people say they can watch "adult" films because they are adults and<br>
are able to decide what to see and they are mature enough to know the <br>
difference between right and wrong. As far as I'm concerned, if something<br>
is considered morally unfit for children to watch or read, I don't want to<br>
see it either. Actually, even the stuff the world considers to be o.k.<br>
for childrens' consumption is riddled with unchristian messages and ideas.<br>
<p>
     Well, just my two-cents worth on this matter.<br>
<p>
     regards,<br>
<p>
     Beng Tang, Singapore.<br>

<i>&gt; 1.  Where is our church when it comes to teaching our teenagers about sex?</i><br>
<i>&gt;[..]</i><br>
<i>&gt; What responsiblity does our church, as a whole, have toward making sure</i><br>
<i>&gt; our youth know about sex.</i><br>
<p>
It is my belief that it is the responsibility of parents to teach their<br>
children about sex.  If parents don't know how, then the schools/the<br>
church can organize seminars in which they can be coached (but that<br>
responsibility should not be arrogated or usurped). Secondly,<br>
schools and the church can reinforce Biblical principals.<br>
<p>
Perhaps my experience was not common.  My parents taught me the facts<br>
of life in an age-appropriate matter; that is, more and more specifics<br>
as I grew up.  They also bought me a copy of "On Becoming A Man".  It<br>
wasn't exactly a page-turner kind of book, but it did provide further<br>
info and did let me do some learning on my own (it could well be argued<br>
that that book is quite dated (ahem!) and that newer books are better<br>
now, but I'm just relating my experience).  Health classes in grade<br>
school and academy gave anatomical details whilst open discussions<br>
in academy classes dealt with related topics (we had lots of discussions,<br>
esp after one of the girls became pregnant and finished the year via home<br>
study; even History and Bible teachers let us have discussions, btw).<br>
There were also films that talked about VD and then a panel of doctors<br>
answered questions, both questions and answers being specific, no holds barred.<br>
By the time I was in college, Wittschiebe's book, God Invented Sex, was out.<br>
<p>
That's the sex part.  What about romance and dating and keeping your<br>
"hormones" under control?  That aspect is fuzzier in my memory and my<br>
recall is that it was not treated as well.  I can relate to the struggles<br>
of getting "hot and bothered" for it surely happened to me.  Without<br>
detailing, I trust it suffices to say that I praise God for His<br>
intervention as a result of the intercessory prayers of my parents, keeping<br>
me from foolishness (in the sense of Proverbs).  Given that, we're attempting<br>
to address this with our teenage daughter (one now, one soon to be).<br>
I will simply list some of the resources we've found helpful:<br>
<p>
1) "Dating with Integrity":  Right off I cannot recall the author, but<br>
the publisher is Wolgemuth &amp; Hyatt and is recent enough to still be<br>
on the bookshelves at your Christian bookstore (not ABC, but your<br>
evangelical bookstore).  Friends recommended this one to us.<br>
2) "Youth, Do You Dare?", Colin Standish, Hartland Publications.  If you're<br>
spooked about anything from Hartland, fine, pass on to the next.<br>
3) Institute in Basic Life Principles seminar, by Bill Gothard.<br>
<p>
In addition:  No titles, sorry, but I understand that Tony Campolo and<br>
Josh McDowell have materials out addressing these issues.  Corrie ten Boom<br>
also treats sex and singleness at various points in her books.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2.  Do we, as a church, do ourselves a disservice with the victorian view</i><br>
<i>&gt;     we take of sex out side of marriage?</i><br>
<p>
I'm thankful that I was taught by word and example that hugging and kissing<br>
and nurturing and complimenting and praising and supporting, etc. we're<br>
parts of the glue that keep a marriage together.  My parents also never<br>
hid from me, e.g., that the reasons why Mr &amp; Mrs X were divorcing and<br>
leaving town were quite complex, but included in them, as far as they<br>
could discern, was that Mrs X (or Mr N, in another case) was unresponsive<br>
to romance and sex and that Satan had taken advantage of that to lead<br>
Mr X into an affair with his office secretary.  You get the idea ...<br>
<p>
I was taught that sex/romance is like fire.  Under control (of the Spirit)<br>
it provides warmth and contentment; out of control, it destroys, whether<br>
in a fire storm or by slowly creeping.  I was never taught that it was<br>
bad, altho some of my friends had been. (Do you suppose this could be<br>
related to why parents will say to a child guilty of naughty behavior,<br>
"You were bad!" (their person) rather than "That was a naughty thing<br>
to do." (the act)?  An over-simplification that leads to a wrong conclusion.).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [..] until I figured out that God doesn't blast you</i><br>
<i>&gt; forever if you fail.  Why couldn't the church have said as much?</i><br>
<p>
Good point.  I think the problem is that people give more focus to<br>
sexual sins than is appropriate, particularly if they ignore other<br>
weighty matters.  Why?  Consider this:  Every general knows you<br>
can defeat your foe if you can surround him, or least attack front<br>
and rear.  I see Satan attempting to destroy God's plans for sexuality<br>
by encouraging libertine sexuality on the one hand whilst encouraging<br>
"sex is bad" among Christians on the other.  For example, you have probably<br>
encountered those who feel that the "original sin" was sexual, or that sex<br>
is only for having children, not for marital pleasure (despite the msgs<br>
in Song of Solomon and Proverbs); or you may have encountered this:<br>
1) New converts have told my pastor-father that they knew they should<br>
not have sex anymore with their unbelieving spouse.  He would then<br>
share 1 Pet 3, 1 Cor 7 (and others) and assure them that they had<br>
an opportunity to develop a deeper relationship with their spouse.<br>
2) An older "saint" told my mother, shortly after she and my father married,<br>
that she must never, never have intercourse on the Sabbath.  When<br>
asked Scripture to support this, she was unable to give any, just that<br>
that was how she had been taught.  [I suspect a misconstrual of Is 58:13.]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And why is it that when something comes up of the sexual nature, our</i><br>
<i>&gt; church family seems to follow the words of a song?</i><br>
<p>
Let change to following God's ways start with each of us.  And that<br>
will change the church.<br>

Hmm.  I have struggled over creation vs evolution for a long long time.  The<br>
key thing that you have to remember when dealing with this topic, is that<br>
"the only absolute truth is GOD, all other truth is relative" (Asa Thoreson<br>
Philisophical Biology, Andrews U). This means that, you HAVE to make some<br>
core assumptions on any topic.  The core assumption underlying evolution, is<br>
the "uniformatarian principle"  knock it out, and you kill evolution.  The<br>
core assumption underlying creation is "there is a prime mover, who is GOD".<br>
My position is that we have to take either of these on FAITH. (there is no<br>
physical "proof" of either one).  Scientists as a rule, get really hostile<br>
when you remind them that many of the principles that they consider absolutes<br>
are being taken on faith.  It matters not whether you are a creationist, or<br>
evolutionist, you still have to accept a core set of beliefs with no concrete<br>
proof of them.  "Truth" changes.  What was "true" yesterday may not be "true"<br>
tommorow.  Remember, once it was "truth" that the world was flat, and that<br>
the universe revolved around the earth.  It was "true" that the atom was the<br>
smallest particle of matter. (now we know about charms, quarks, pi-mesons<br>
and a whole zoo of sub-atomic particles).  Keeping this principle in mind<br>
can help you deal with these things.<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
Cheers<br>

<i>&gt; The question about Ellen White and prophecy points to a common misconception </i><br>
<i>&gt; about prophecy. We tend to always think of prophecy in terms of prediction. If</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; one studies prophecy and prophets in scripture, I think you will find that </i><br>
<i>&gt; prophets communicate messages from God to man. Many prophets never predicted </i><br>
<i>&gt; anything. Predictions within prophecy come only as they relate to a specific </i><br>
<i>&gt; message and usually in a conditional manner, i.e. if you don't change your </i><br>
<i>&gt; course then this will be the result.</i><br>
<p>
I understand that prophecy need not be predicting the future.  However,<br>
those who are considered to be prophets often do have some insight into<br>
the future.  God said that he will do nothing except he shows it to His<br>
prophets.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ed Fargusson (Compuserve 72450,2430)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Two points.  Some folk think prophets make only prophecies (predictions</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the future); however, my understanding is that a prophet is one who</i><br>
<i>&gt; has a message from God (which can include stuff about the future); and,</i><br>
<i>&gt; yes, EGW did write a lot of what could be considered commentary.</i><br>
<p>
What is the SDA criteria for prophethood.  I am a Charismatic/Pentecostal.<br>
I have known many people to prophecy powerful prophecies.  Once I heard<br>
someone prophecy what I had just thought.  Another time, someone told me <br>
something specific that I had just prayed for earlier that day.  Yet, we<br>
do not use the term "prophet" for anyone who prophecies, except maybe in the<br>
most general sense of the term.  <br>
<p>
Like White, most Charismatics/Pentecostals that many consider to be prophets<br>
don't claim to be prophets.  David Wilkerson says that he is not a prophet.<br>
I don't know if Paul Cain says that he is not one, but he doesn't claim the<br>
title.  (Most men of God with gifts of this caliber are too humble to <br>
try to claim titles for themselves.)  Paul Cain often does predict the future,<br>
or whow supernatural knowledge.  For example, instead of giving a word of<br>
knowledge "someone has a pain in their leg" the Lord often gives him the <br>
person's name.  He has also predicted future events.  When he went to meet<br>
with John Wimber, he said that one the day he arrived in California there <br>
would be a local earthquake, and on the day he left there would be a <br>
world renouned earthquake elsewhere on earth.  Sure enough, there was a<br>
local earthquake and the Armenian earthquake.  These were given as signs,<br>
and, from what I hear, the Lord often gives Paul Cain signs.  <br>
<p>
The reason some call Paul Cain a prophet (after witnessing him minister)<br>
is because they see a well developed prophetic gift.  There are many people<br>
who prophecy, even if it is just once.  But we don't generally call them<br>
prophets.  Occasionally pastors and teachers prophesy.  Was White's main<br>
work prophetic?<br>

I think it may clarify this issue by quoting Elen White's definition<br>
of faith:  <br>
<p>
"What is faith? . . . It is an assent of the understanding to God's<br>
words which binds the heart in willing consecration and service to<br>
God, . . . Faith is rendering to God the intellectual powers,<br>
abandonment of the mind and will to God, and making Christ the only<br>
door to enter into the kingdom of heaven."  --Faith and Works, p. 25<br>
<p>
Thus, obedience is not a part of faith.  But one who has the kind of<br>
faith Ellen White is refering to will obey.<br>

<p>
No, but it definitely takes work to build a relationship with anyone, including<br>
God.  I define work as the putting forth of effort or the expenditure of energy.<br>
The difference here is working at a relationship, not working at salvation. The<br>
salvation part is a free gift to all who would accept Christ and start a<br>
relationship with Him.  As long as I demonstrate my acceptance by maintaining<br>
the relationship, I will continue to be assured of retaining my free gift of<br>
salvation.<br>

This is (I hope) to be my only post on this topic, and it is already one<br>
more than I had originally intended! <br>
<p>
Viewing the origins issue as "Creation Vs Evolution" invariably results in<br>
a person thinking that it's either one extreme or the other. That is, we<br>
must choose between special creation ex nihilo, 6000 years ago as many<br>
Christians claim is taught by Genesis 1 and 2, and atheistic evolution<br>
over billions of years. The next step down this path is to assert that<br>
because no-one is able to state a viable mechanism for atheistic evolution<br>
then it is clearly wrong, and therefore recent creation must be the answer.<br>
<p>
This is an oversimplification which in my opinion is worth avoiding altogether.<br>
One reason why I have a certain amount of distaste towards the "Creation<br>
Science" movement is because they like to approach things this way.<br>
<p>
It is worth noting that "scientific truth" is merely that which provides<br>
the most useful model available at any given time. Hence the assertion that<br>
because scientists keep changing their mind on truth, they must be wrong,<br>
is quite ridiculous. Science and pragmatism are closely aligned, in that<br>
both define truth as "what works". If something comes along that works<br>
better, great! No problem! (In principle of course...in practice, there<br>
are "conservatives" and "liberals" amongst scientists too).<br>
<p>
My own approach to the origins issue is to base everything on my belief<br>
that "God is the ultimate originator and sustainer of all things". On<br>
this point, at least, I think most Christians can agree. It would make<br>
things much less problematic if we could simply stop there!<br>

[From Paul Johnston via Sharon Johnston's account  sj1j@andrew.cmu.edu]<br>
<p>
Ruben, I didn't mean to frighten you.  Because I spoke favorably of my<br>
neighborhood Episcopalian parish, you strongly suggested that I was<br>
consorting with the dragon of Revelation 12.<br>
   I nevertheless like worshipping there when I can.  I'm very fond of<br>
the rector.  The organist and his wife are personal friends of mine.  If<br>
it helps, let me assure you...<br>
   * I am active in my local SDA congregation.  I've been Sabbath School<br>
superintendent.  I teach a Bible class.  I've now been asked to assist<br>
in pastoral visitation.  I've spent my fair share of time on the church<br>
board.  I've been on the nominating committee three times in seven years.<br>
   * If pedigree mattered, I'd tell you I'm a sixth-generation Adventist<br>
with roots in Battle Creek.  But I won't.<br>
   * From infancy to my earliteen years, I was in the Far East with my<br>
missionary parents.  It's still difficult not to see my work and my very<br>
existence in terms of mission.<br>
   * I seriously consider the pastoral ministry.<br>
   But Ruben, you haven't answered my question.  This is what I thought<br>
was the most important issue in my latest communique on SDAnet.  I think<br>
our denomination has an identity crisis.  I'll repeat the question.  "Do<br>
you think our denomination can find a niche?  Survive?  Thrive?"<br>
   I'd also be interested in your response to some merely sociological<br>
questions.<br>
   1.) Do you think the Seventh-Day Adventist Church is, or should be, a<br>
fundamentalist denomination?  How do you define fundamentalism,<br>
especially as it addresses biblical interpretation?<br>
   2.) What, in your mind, characterizes a sect or cult?  Compare or<br>
contrast SDA's you know (include yourself if you'd like) with your<br>
understanding of what makes a person a cultist.<br>
   3.) Can an Adventist be sure enough about the superiority of his<br>
doctrine to call someone else's religion false?  Can you or I be that<br>
sure and still be humble?  (Remember we Adventists learned about the<br>
Sabbath from another denomination.  Are we that open to change--that<br>
open to admitting error--today?)<br>
   This isn't an IQ test or anything.  It's not a political correctness<br>
exam.  There are no correct answers.  But your answers will give me a<br>
better basis for understanding where you're coming from.  It would be<br>
enlightening to hear the analyses of others on our diverse network.<br>
   Please, Ruben, don't worry about my overactive apostate gland.<br>

After a 18-month absence, I returned.  The place was mostly as I left it,<br>
a few things were better.  Nobody challenged me and said "why were you gone",<br>
just welcomed me back as if I belonged.<br>
<p>
I returned for the same reasons I had gone there in the first place.  There <br>
were good social opportunities with many people my own age.  The music was<br>
of a contemporary nature and I could express myself my own way.  The <br>
teaching was improved and extended to one-hour classes.  Everyone believed <br>
in having good health and no one drunk or smoked.  <br>
<p>
Most importantly, I felt my need of the place.  They hadn't changed the<br>
standards they had before, in fact they were tougher.  There was still<br>
the dress code, the rules, and the large percentage of your income they <br>
wanted.  They seemed to know nothing of grace--for every bit of progress<br>
I made, they said I had to work at it.  The usual weekend morning service<br>
wouldn't be enough, I also had to come to various weekday meetings.<br>
<p>
By now it may be clear to you that I am not talking about my church, <br>
but about my health club.  It doesn't hurt to realize from time to time that <br>
we're much more like a club than we want to admit.  Perhaps the reason <br>
we don't attract more people is that we don't charge enough admission<br>
and we let people off too easily.  For examples, take the Willow Creek<br>
Community <br>
Church of So. Barrington, IL.  They will not let you become a member of that <br>
church unless you are involved with leading out a small group ministry <br>
for at least a year.  And people are standing in line to do just that.<br>
<p>
It's probably premature to have a divine worship service at church based <br>
on high-impact aerobics as the major form of worship.  But I have seen <br>
an Adventist health club work successfully before as a witnessing tool,<br>
and I am trying to get some people around the Chicago area to think big.<br>
<p>
The church's first function is the hospital for sinners.  But too often <br>
it becomes the hospice for saints.  What will it take to change our church<br>
from spiritual hospice to spiritual health spa?  What are the equivalents<br>
of spiritual high-impact aerobics?  spiritual weight training?<br>
spiritual exercise bikes?<br>

Paul's question  "Do you think the church can find a niche?  Survive?<br>
Thrive?"  seems to be a general one.  I will take a stab:<br>
<p>
I believe the church has found a niche and is surviving, and that in the long<br>
run may inhibit its thriving.<br>
<p>
All religions are in the business of delivering security, and the SDA church<br>
is no different.  In fact, since we offer an exclusive "we are the best"<br>
type of deal, SDA's tend to find more security from denominational identity<br>
than Christians at large.  The deal is simple:  Keep the commandments,<br>
and pony up the tithe, and you're in.  <br>
<p>
The result is that today 90% of all resources of the church go to maintain<br>
the existing institution.  (this, by the way, is low compared to other <br>
denominations.)  Some conferences admit openly that their ministers are <br>
there to serve the tithe-payers. (Illinois and Pennsylvania, for two)<br>
 The rest structure their policy that way anyway.  This constituency<br>
of tithe-payers is naturally very wary of anything which would affect their<br>
perceived security within the church, and thus the conference leadership<br>
is very wary of offending them.<br>
<p>
Reaching the unchurched and providing security to the churched are <br>
mutually exclusive goals, and any organization can only expect to do one<br>
of those two well.  The SDA church has focused on the latter, as have<br>
most mainline denominations.  (I speak here of N. America's church).<br>
As an honored veteran of one of my two local churches put it, "if these<br>
new youth are going to take our seats, they may as well not come."<br>
This on the first day in 10 years that the church had been filled to<br>
standing-room only!<br>
<p>
Paul was wondering about the global niche of the church.  This is natural<br>
when there is only one church in town and it needs to reach as many<br>
people as it can.  In their particular case, the pastor has chosen to<br>
focus on attracting upscale baby-boomers, extracting a horrible cost in<br>
increased<br>
classism and splits between haves and have-nots.  <br>
<p>
In a larger metropolitan area, SDA churches still try to reach out to<br>
cover the metro area and pick various niches in a topical way.  Precious<br>
few<br>
SDA churches are community churches, fewer are family churches.<br>
In the Chicago suburbs, we have a right-wing 1888 message church, a <br>
country-hayseed church, a 1970's-blah church, a black church, a Korean <br>
church, a Filipino church, a hospital church, a liberal<br>
second-generation ethnic-traditional worship church, and several others.<br>
 At my church,<br>
we cover 49 suburbs plus the city, and 75% of our members drive past some<br>
other SDA church to get to ours.  So cooperation between churches and <br>
conferences could lead to reducing overlap in services provided<br>
and make sure that our group of churches is better positioned to meet needs.<br>

[From Tony Dyson]<br>
I have just realized that I have an opportunity to agree with Ruben on<br>
something, so I thought I'd better take it up  :)<br>
<p>
Ruben was using some humour (whoops - humor for all you American-speakers)<br>
in his post to you, Bruce, so don't get too stirred up. Although I was<br>
reminded of the old adage that "many a true word is spoken in jest".<br>
<p>
Now I'm no believer in perfectionism, but this one point struck me: <br>
perhaps "working on a relationship" also entails working on removing<br>
obstacles to that relationship. In that context, trying ones best to<br>
live the way God would have one live is indeed part of working on<br>
building a relationship with him. <br>
<p>
Let's not be too quick to use the label "legalist" or the phrase<br>
"salvation by works" whenever someone mentions lifestyle, standards<br>
or the ten commandments.<br>
<p>
Tony<br>
<p>
P.S.  By the way, what do net.americans mean when they say "Go figure." ?<br>
      Is this a normal speech pattern over there?<br>
      Cheerio...<br>
[Yes.  The phrase denotes an apparent inconsistency which is worthy <br>
of your attention.  Go Figure.  SCT]<br>

As the happy day of completing my doctoral program and receiving a Ph.D<br>
draws nearer (probably late '93), I am forced to consider some of the <br>
eventualities that may happen after that time.<br>
<p>
1)  Getting no job and losing net access<br>
<p>
2)  Getting a job out of the country (Jamaica, for instance) and losing <br>
    net access.<br>
<p>
3)  Getting a job at a government institution where running mailing lists<br>
    like this (or even receiving them) is banned.<br>
<p>
4)  In any case, losing my account at andrew.cmu.edu and having to move<br>
    the list elsewhere, sometime during 1994.<br>
<p>
Some of the original people who were on SDAnet when it started have <br>
provided advice to me in an unofficial capacity from time to time, <br>
and I have appreciated this.  When I have been unfair to some person or<br>
group, I hear about it.<br>
<p>
I feel that now is the time to form a more official board to ensure<br>
both accountability and survivability of SDAnet.  The types of people<br>
I would like to see serve on this board should have at least one of the<br>
following attributes:<br>
<p>
1)  A long term job, likely to maintain position and personal net access<br>
    for some length of time<br>
<p>
2)  Influence in the computing dept. of an SDA institution to arrange a<br>
    backup host machine for SDAnet if necessary, and/or an account for <br>
    the moderator.<br>
<p>
3)  Willingness to serve as backup moderator or replacement moderator <br>
    if necessary<br>
<p>
4)  Technical knowledge of networking and mailing list software<br>
<p>
5)  An interest in seeing SDAnet continue for the long term.<br>
<p>
<p>
If you meet any one of the five requirements above, and would like <br>
to serve on the board, please let me know.  If there are more than five<br>
people that apply for the board, we will put the names out on the net<br>
and let everyone vote.<br>

<p>
It would be interesting to know if this is actually going to happen or<br>
simply was proposed.  This is an instance of the "social dimension"<br>
aspect of the EC, which is the most controversial part and which has<br>
gotten a lot of bad publicity the last few years as part of the<br>
Maastricht Treaty debate.  Some countries, e.g. Britain, are going the<br>
other direction, with High Street shops opening on Sunday and ignoring<br>
the exhortations of the Church of England.<br>

<i>&gt; Well, well, for once I agree with Ruben on something!  I also do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; think that people should get rich selling Bibles or any other article</i><br>
<i>&gt; of religion.  Guess how this makes me feel about the way we run our</i><br>
<i>&gt; literature evangelism work?  No, I realize that most L.E.s are not</i><br>
<i>&gt; rich -- on the contrary, they sometimes are starving because they rely</i><br>
<i>&gt; on commission and the books are so over-priced that almost nobody can</i><br>
<i>&gt; afford to buy them anymore!  When will the higher-ups see that if we</i><br>
<i>&gt; really want to spread the Good News, then we must make it affordable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm for putting L.E.s on salary and lowering the price of the books to</i><br>
<i>&gt; within reach of at least the middle class, if not lower!</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps another perspective would be useful here.  First of all, few<br>
book authors get rich.  I work with at least one author (of techical<br>
books).  Royalties are about 10% of list price, and if you sell 25K<br>
copies of a $20 paperback you make $50K.  This certainly beats<br>
starving, but it's poor compensation for the amount of time spent.<br>
<p>
Another point is that a publisher may use large profits from one book<br>
to subsidize some other important, but loss-making book.  For example,<br>
I would guess that Pacific Press etc. use profits from "Desire of<br>
Ages" to subsidize some of the really obscure EGW books.  Another<br>
example would be a seminal event like publication of the Dead Sea<br>
Scrolls;  these are very important but will never compete with James<br>
Dobson and Chuck Swindoll for popularity.<br>

Several people wrote in and asked for more information.  The article is <br>
"The Sunday Absurdity" in the Jan/Feb 1993 issue of Liberty, by <br>
David N. Marshall.<br>
<p>
He opens the article by noting that this article first appeared in _The<br>
Economist_  (A British newsmagazine) but unfortunately does not give <br>
a reference to which issue.  Evidently the European Commission originally<br>
prepared a draft that mandated a weekly rest day without saying which <br>
day it should be.  The European Parliament amended the draft to designate<br>
Saturday-Sunday as the period of rest.  The cabinet, it appears, <br>
under pressure settled on Sunday.  <br>
<p>
The Christian Democrats of Germany and the trade unionists of Germany are<br>
specified by _The Economist_ for pushing this plan.  Liberty notes<br>
that Catholic prelates have also been pushing for the same in the past<br>
few years especially.  The rest of the Liberty article is essentially<br>
analysis and unfortunately does not give any details on how imminent<br>
the passage of such a law might be.<br>
<p>
It does note that the strongest sunday-closing laws in Europe are currently<br>
enforced in Germany.  In England, France, Holland, and Ireland (the only <br>
countries mentioned) Sunday laws are on the books but not enforced.  It also <br>
notes that France, Italy, and Belgium, are intervening in favor of the <br>
Sunday law.<br>
<p>
We need more information.  Any European correspondents are strongly encouraged<br>
to contribute.<br>

Boy, you ought to have a good time with this one.<br>
1. Tobacco is an insidous poison<br>
2. Predicted the san-fransico earthquake<br>
3. Described nerve conduction in the brain well before it was understood<br>
4. Saw the location of several of our institutions in vision<br>
<p>
The great majority of things would fall under the broad label of "clairvoyance"<br>
(NOTE:  I only use this word as a common term.  Clairvoyance is spiritism,<br>
and such is NOT what EGW was.  However, if you look it up, it basically means<br>
"seeing things which have not happened".<br>

<i>&gt; "In the olden days" when I was a teen, we were taught not to have sex because:</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	1.  You might get VD</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	2.  You might get pregnant</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	3.  You won't have a normal sex life in marriage</i><br>
<i>&gt; These scare tactics don't work.  I like the approach the LDS Church uses now.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Actually, they've always used this.)  Young people should no engage in</i><br>
<i>&gt; premarital sex so they can be worthy of a temple marriage.  Having a temple</i><br>
<i>&gt; marriage is declares to the world that the couple has saved themselves for</i><br>
<i>&gt; their future spouse and they have victoriously overcome sexual temptation.</i><br>
<p>
Sure, the scare tactics have almost entirely negative effects - they feed<br>
rebellion in those who would be rebellious, and those who are too scared to<br>
rebel often end up carrying that over into marriage, with unhealthy <br>
consequences.  Those who end up doing it for other reasons are often <br>
consumed by guilt and the pressures of trying to lead a double life -<br>
one for public consumption and a different life in private.<br>
<p>
I see a potential problem with the temple marriage philosophy, as<br>
admirable as it is.  I know far too many girls who have been raped at <br>
some stage - far, far too many - and it still makes me feel ill every <br>
time I hear of another case.  The problem is, when all this heavy emphasis <br>
on purity (especially when talked about in terms of purity = virginity) <br>
exists, it makes people who have been raped feel unworthy, impure, defiled,<br>
left out, sick in the stomach, deceitful because they don't feel they can <br>
honestly pipe up with the declaration of virginity that is almost expected <br>
etc.  How do you handle this? <br>
<p>
The second problem is one that SDAs have too - those who have not lived<br>
up to the standards required for a temple marriage (LDS) or those who<br>
have been caught (SDA) become something like second class citizens.<br>
In the SDA case, this means that lots of people tend to end up living<br>
double lives (one for public consumption, one for what they do - or used<br>
to do - in private.)  This tends to either bottle up a lot of guilt, or<br>
create continuing anxiety about being caught and having one's name<br>
dragged through the mud, or just split people into almost two<br>
personalities.  None of these options is healthy.  Where did Christ's<br>
unconditional love go?<br>
<p>
I feel we (SDAs, and probably most Christian churches) put far too much <br>
emphasis on sexual immorality as a socially unacceptable sin (don't get <br>
caught or else your name will be dragged through the mud...)  The other <br>
dimension to the problem is that the people most strenuously advocating <br>
no pre-marital sex are often those who experimented with it themselves <br>
in their younger days.  The whole thing would probably be far better <br>
handled if we left more room for people to make mistakes and bad<br>
choices.  This would reduce the attractiveness of the activity to those<br>
who just want to rebel in the biggest possible way, and reduce the guilt<br>
and hiding in shame problems of those who do it for other reasons.<br>
<p>
There _must_ be room for people to make mistakes.  Allowing people such<br>
room is _not_ the same as condoning an activity.  Unfortunately, this<br>
seems to be a distinction that most people never make.  (This could be<br>
a topic for a whole new post.  I just don't feel like starting it.<br>
Someone push me for it and I will :-)<br>
<p>
The best (and I mean the absolute best) presentation I have ever heard<br>
on this area was by Dr. Danielle Florida at the recent Adventist<br>
Students Association (A.S.A.) "Theological Symposium" at Avondale<br>
College.  (Must remember to post something about this - nothing else<br>
like the Symposium occurs anywhere else in the world.)<br>
    Dr. Florida works at a sexual health clinic, so is eminently <br>
qualified to talk about the matter! This talk was sensible, factual, <br>
very open and very non-judgmental.  I believe the non-judgmental stance<br>
is far more effective than the anti-sex railing which is more usually<br>
seen and less often makes any connection with the audience.  I also<br>
appreciate being treated as an adult - given information with which to<br>
make my own decisions.  On the other hand, the audience was composed of<br>
Uni. students aged 18 up.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Many teens engage in sexual activity along with drugs or alcohol.  So the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sexual activity is actually a component of their rebellion.  Why do so many</i><br>
<i>&gt; teens get pregnant even when birth control is very available now days?  First,</i><br>
<i>&gt; many won't buy it because it indicates pre-meditated sin.  Others rationalize</i><br>
<i>&gt; that if they aren't on birth control, they might use that as their "excuse" to</i><br>
<i>&gt; say no.</i><br>
<p>
I once advocated that all SDA men (I assume unmarried?) should carry <br>
condoms, for the sake of playing devil's advocate in a discussion.  While <br>
I wasn't entirely serious, I wasn't entirely flippant either.  There are <br>
valid points to be made for both sides of the argument, depending perhaps <br>
on how pragmatic or idealistic one is.  I'm tempted to say more, but I'm <br>
not sure how controversial I can commit to being given my current workload.<br>
So, for all you Americans (and now Tony ;-), go figure.<br>
If someone pushes me hard enough, I'll post some more.<br>
<p>
    Mazz.<br>
<p>
Have you ever noticed that replies to your posts only leave in the bits<br>
they disagree with?  It can be a bit disconcerting on the net.<br>

<i>&gt; Well, well, for once I agree with Ruben on something!  I also do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; think that people should get rich selling Bibles or any other article</i><br>
<i>&gt; of religion.  Guess how this makes me feel about the way we run our</i><br>
<i>&gt; literature evangelism work?  No, I realize that most L.E.s are not</i><br>
<i>&gt; rich -- on the contrary, they sometimes are starving because they rely</i><br>
<i>&gt; on commission and the books are so over-priced that almost nobody can</i><br>
<i>&gt; afford to buy them anymore!  When will the higher-ups see that if we</i><br>
<i>&gt; really want to spread the Good News, then we must make it affordable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm for putting L.E.s on salary and lowering the price of the books to</i><br>
<i>&gt; within reach of at least the middle class, if not lower!</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps another perspective would be useful here.  First of all, few<br>
book authors get rich.  I work with at least one author (of techical<br>
books).  Royalties are about 10% of list price, and if you sell 25K<br>
copies of a $20 paperback you make $50K.  This certainly beats<br>
starving, but it's poor compensation for the amount of time spent.<br>
<p>
Another point is that a publisher may use large profits from one book<br>
to subsidize some other important, but loss-making book.  For example,<br>
I would guess that Pacific Press etc. use profits from "Desire of<br>
Ages" to subsidize some of the really obscure EGW books.  Another<br>
example would be a seminal event like publication of the Dead Sea<br>
Scrolls;  these are very important but will never compete with James<br>
Dobson and Chuck Swindoll for popularity.<br>

As soon as I saw the post on the _Ministry_ article, "The Sunday<br>
Absurdity" (January-February 1993, pp. 23-24) I immediately did a search<br>
of the Expanded Academic Index in our online catalog (not yet available<br>
to the net, but I'm exploring that possibility).  This is an index of<br>
about 1500 current periodicals in all areas.  Sure enough, the<br>
_Economist_ article is cited, "Never on a Sunday," (Europe's Blue Laws)<br>
(editorial), October 19, 1991 (v321, n7729), p. 16--hardly new news.<br>
The abstract says, "The European Community has introduced a directive<br>
that bans Sunday working, declaring that it is a health and safety<br>
measure.  German Christian Democrats and tradue unionists brought about<br>
the directive, which may become widely unpopular."  While it should be<br>
noted that this index is largely U.S.-oriented, this was the only<br>
article in the entire database (of over 1 million citations) with the<br>
subject heading "Sunday legislation--Europe."  I have not taken the time<br>
to try other remote databases that might have more information on this<br>
topic.  <br>
<p>
It might be worth noting that most of Western Europe is quite secular in<br>
orientation, and it's an unlikely place for a universal religious Sunday<br>
law to begin.  Actually, I find the whole notion of a universal Sunday<br>
law to be a quaint 19th century relic, and SDA eschatology in this<br>
regard in much need of revision.  My perception of world religion is<br>
that much of the "Christian" world is secular (including the U.S.,<br>
though religion here has more influence that in most other Western<br>
countries), but the majority of the world population is<br>
non-Christian--Communist, Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, Jewish, secular, etc.,<br>
hardly people likely to establish a Christian law.  Actually, I'm<br>
curious how missionaries to non-Christian societies handle this issue.<br>
In Israel (not to mention strong Islamic societies), the notion must<br>
seem ludicrous.  I suspect this idea was based on a 19th century world<br>
view, with Europe ascendent and most of the world a part of one or<br>
another European empire.  In addition, I think it worth noting that<br>
many societies are getting more tolerant of minorities (with the glaring<br>
exception of Yugoslavia)--including religious ones (witness Spain, as<br>
but one example).  Certainly the trend in the U.S. is toward repeal of<br>
blue laws along with a definite trend toward a multi-cultural,<br>
heterogenous society [something which I believe is behind some of the<br>
desperate attempts of the religious right to prevent this trend].<br>
<p>
I really didn't mean to start a general discussion of Sunday laws (but<br>
merely to provide information).  For what it's worth, there it is.<br>
Needless to say, these are my personal views and do not necessarily<br>
reflect the position of my employer (or, for that matter, the "holy"<br>
Seminary!).<br>

[From Tim Swensen]<br>
SDAnet:<br>
<p>
I must disagree with Steve when he says that "Reaching the unchurched and <br>
providing security to the churched are mutually exclusive goals, and any <br>
organization can only expect to do one of those two well."  Come to think of<br>
it, I disagree that the SDA church should be primarily in the business of <br>
providing security for its members.  Put bluntly, our security is in Christ<br>
alone.  The church is composed of humans.  Sooner or later each of us is <br>
likely to be profoundly disappointed or hurt by someone in the church -- <br>
perhaps even by someone in its leadership.  Unless Christ is the foundation <br>
of our security, we will have a hard time dealing with this.<br>
<p>
Reaching the unsaved (could I have said "unchurched" instead?) is the primary <br>
reason Jesus instituted the Christian church.  ("Go ye into all nations....")<br>
Reaching out to the unconverted and seeing them accept Christ is crucial<br>
to the health of the local congregation and should in no way hinder our <br>
sense of security in Christ, but rather should draw us closer to him.  This <br>
assumes, of course, that our affection for the church is based on our love<br>
of Christ and the pleasure we derive from worshiping and working with others <br>
who love Him as well.  If, on the other hand, our attachment to the church <br>
derives primarily from our enjoyment of its amenities (nice organ, soft pews, <br>
beautiful windows, etc...) then it may indeed bother us that the "uncultured" <br>
are sitting with us in the pew.  I pray that we love the church for the former<br>
reason and not the latter!<br>
<p>

[I agree with Tim about what the motives of the church should be.  <br>
I was speaking only to the case of what are the motives now.  SCT]<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; Is this salvation by works, or what ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, but it definitely takes work to build a relationship with anyone, including</i><br>
<i>&gt;God.  I define work as the putting forth of effort or the expenditure of energy</i><br>
<i>&gt;The difference here is working at a relationship, not working at salvation.</i><br>
<p>
I don't really see the diff. 'cause the end point of working at the relationship<br>
is to get salvation anyway, isn't it ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The</i><br>
<i>&gt; salvation part is a free gift to all who would accept Christ and start a</i><br>
<i>&gt; relationship with Him. </i><br>
<p>
Isn`t this  a bit like saying that the salvation part is a free gift to all<br>
who accept Christ and obey him ?<br>
<p>
I can't really see the difference between working at obedience and working <br>
at a relationship, its still working and the ultimate object of the work is <br>
the same, salvation.<br>
<p>
Yes one can argue that one can obey without a good relationship, but I think<br>
you will find that that type of obedience is a whitewash. One can also<br>
have a relationship without any obedience, in which case the relationship<br>
is a farce. It seems to me like you sort of need both things simultaneously.<br>
<p>
But of course you know how the bible tests whether a relationship is good or<br>
not, don't you ? "By their fruits ye shall know them...a good tree does not<br>
bring forth good fruits neither does a good tree bring forth bad fruits."<br>
<p>
When the bible talks here about a tree it is talking about relationships, just<br>
look up John 15 about the vine for confirmation of this point. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;By the way, what was out of context?...your comments or mine?  I believe my</i><br>
<i>&gt;comments were relavent and in the context of the subject line.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

My quotation of your comments were out of context.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
Steve's discussion of the EC and Sunday Laws reminds me of something<br>
that I'd like to hear input on from others.  Does the prophecy of Dan. 2<br>
(large man image of various metal types) and particularly the time in which<br>
we live represented by the feet of the image apply to the EC?  In other<br>
words, does the general SDA viewpoint that the feet and toes of part iron<br>
and part clay that don't mix apply to the EC?  If so, then the EC will either<br>
never happen or will fail shortly after joining.  This of course would<br>
represent a tremendous waste of money trying to pull off something prophecied<br>
to never happen.<br>
<p>
Our church is currently holding a Daniel seminar and just covered Dan. 2.<br>
The person leading out pointed out that history records 7 times where<br>
attempts to conquor and politically combine Europe have failed, including<br>
attempts by Charlemain, Napolean, Kaiser, Hitler, etc.  But these were<br>
attempts at military conquoring and would have been rulerships by one<br>
person.  The EC is a little different but having one monitary system, etc,<br>
does come pretty close in my mind.<br>
<p>
What do you all think?<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; "What is faith? . . . It is an assent of the understanding to God's</i><br>
<i>&gt; words which binds the heart in willing consecration and service to</i><br>
<i>&gt; God, . . . &gt;&gt;&gt; Faith is rendering to God the intellectual powers,</i><br>
<i>&gt; abandonment of the mind and will to God, &lt;&lt;&lt; and making Christ the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; door to enter into the kingdom of heaven."  --Faith and Works, p. 25</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thus, obedience is not a part of faith.  But one who has the kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; faith Ellen White is refering to will obey.</i><br>
<p>
Excellent quote; for me, esp what I put in &gt;&gt;&gt; .. &lt;&lt;&lt;.  IMHO, sanctification<br>
is the process by which the Holy Spirit leads us into accepting the Lordship<br>
of Christ in every nook and cranny of our "intellectual powers", our mind,<br>
will, and emotions (cf 2 Chr 16:9a).  "Abandonment" is apt.  And to trust Him<br>
that far we need to know Him intimately (the relationship part).<br>
<p>
The motive for obedience?  Love.  Jn 14:15, Rom 5:5, 1 Jn 4:19.<br>
The means?  Grace (= the desire and the power).  Phi 2:13.<br>

Hi,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ruben, I didn't mean to frighten you.  Because I spoke favorably of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; neighborhood Episcopalian parish, you strongly suggested that I was</i><br>
<i>&gt; consorting with the dragon of Revelation 12.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, its just that I am very disturbed by some rather unfortunate<br>
ecumenical moves within the SDA church. And I'm not necessarily referring to<br>
individuals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    But Ruben, you haven't answered my question.  This is what I thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; was the most important issue in my latest communique on SDAnet.  I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; our denomination has an identity crisis.  I'll repeat the question.  "Do</i><br>
<i>&gt; you think our denomination can find a niche?  Survive?  Thrive?"</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, I didn't realise the question was directed specifically at me.<br>
<p>
As for anwering the question, my reply is best outlined in G.C. I think<br>
to answer it a little more specifically that this crisis is somewhat <br>
reflected in the history of Israel at the time of Ezekiel, and at the<br>
time of Christ's first advent. So I think our denomination will ride out<br>
the crisis the same ways as Israel did on these occasions in the past.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    I'd also be interested in your response to some merely sociological</i><br>
<i>&gt; questions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    1.) Do you think the Seventh-Day Adventist Church is, or should be, a</i><br>
<i>&gt; fundamentalist denomination?  How do you define fundamentalism,</i><br>
<i>&gt; especially as it addresses biblical interpretation?</i><br>
<p>
No I don't think the SDA church is or should be fundamental. Fundamentalism<br>
is taking every single word as being inerrant, which I disagree with.<br>
I also disagree with libral scriptural interpretation, such that the clear<br>
bible meaning is distorted or lost. EGW says that we should take the bible<br>
as it reads. This means free from the trandition of men, and their philosphy.<br>
Irresepective of who they may be. Interestingly the traditions of men <br>
encompasses culture, because that is what culture simply is.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    2.) What, in your mind, characterizes a sect or cult?  Compare or</i><br>
<i>&gt; contrast SDA's you know (include yourself if you'd like) with your</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding of what makes a person a cultist.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I personally think the SDA church was better off when it was considered<br>
a sect (ie before 1953 and that nice episode with Dr W.Martin). As to what<br>
characterises a cult, I really havn't though too much about it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    3.) Can an Adventist be sure enough about the superiority of his</i><br>
<i>&gt; doctrine to call someone else's religion false?  Can you or I be that</i><br>
<i>&gt; sure and still be humble?  (Remember we Adventists learned about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sabbath from another denomination.  Are we that open to change--that</i><br>
<i>&gt; open to admitting error--today?)</i><br>
<p>
Well if I wasn't sure of SDA theology I would leave the church immediately.<br>
Why stick around if you don't even know if its the truth or not, heck, what a <br>
waste. As to whether SDAs can be sure enough regarding this point, isn't this<br>
the whole concept of Adventism, to call people out of Babylon. If we don't<br>
know whether Babylon is Babylon or not, or if we don't know what to call them<br>
out into then what's the point of Adventism. Can we be sure and humble, yes<br>
I can't necessarily see any conflict between the two, however as with all <br>
things the track of perdition lies very close to the track of salvation.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;    This isn't an IQ test or anything.  It's not a political correctness</i><br>
<i>&gt; exam.  There are no correct answers.  But your answers will give me a</i><br>
<i>&gt; better basis for understanding where you're coming from.  It would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; enlightening to hear the analyses of others on our diverse network.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Did I pass ?? <br>
It should have been multiple choice, they're mor fun that way.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;    Please, Ruben, don't worry about my overactive apostate gland.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<p>
he, he, this I'll have to remember.<br>
<p>
<p>
Ruben.<br>

I have often thought that the pastor's major role should be to act as a<br>
"shepherd to the flock", ministering to the church members and equipping<br>
*them* for outreach. There is a Biblical reference to back this up, but<br>
I can't think of it right now.<br>
<p>
What do you think? We tend to expect too much of our pastors, seeing them<br>
as evangelists, counsellors, preachers as well as shepherds. Many fill some<br>
of these roles well, but rarely are all of them filled by one person.<br>
Besides, laying it all on the pastor turns the congregation into an audience.<br>

Iron and clay...let's see...<br>

Serbs &amp; Croatians?<br>
Muslims &amp; Christians?<br>
Neo-Nazis &amp; Eastern refugees?<br>
Irish catholics &amp; Irish protestants?<br>
Arabs &amp; Jews?<br>
<p>
Prophecy or no prophecy, any Earthly power trying to unite Europe, be it<br>
economically, politically or whatever, is up against it. Makes me wonder<br>
how the Romans did it in the first place!<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
<p>
In my study of EGWs position on this issue I found that EGW does not<br>
restrict the feet and toes to the nations of Europe. Instead she uses<br>
the phrase "kingdoms of this world" when refering to them. The notion<br>
that they refer specifically to the European powers was most popular<br>
with other pioneers such as Uriah Smith. Like wise the concept that<br>
Europe would never unite is slightly misleading because under the Holy<br>
Roman Empire it was effectively united. Whether or not the EC will unite<br>
is hard to say but then Rev does say that the kings of the earth unite with<br>
the Dragon.<br>
<p>
I prefer to think that Dan 2 refers to the entire world and not just one<br>
small segment of it.<br>
<p>

I already have three volunteers for the board, which is good because I <br>
didn't specify what the tasks of the board would be as yet.  More <br>
volunteers are still welcome. <br>
<p>
At this point in time I don't envision that the board would ever physically<br>
get together in one place and meet.  That's what E-mail is for.  I do <br>
think it will be helpful to discuss new services that could be offered<br>
in addition to the discussion service that is here now.<br>
<p>
Some of these could include:<br>
<p>
A on-line library:<br>
LISTSERV software incorporates this feature automatically, so this would <br>
fit more naturally into SDA-L, except that SDA-L's days on LLUVM are<br>
numbered.  As soon as Enoch Hwang gets around to it (ten minutes to<br>
forever),<br>
it will move to La Sierra and a brain-dead Unix LISTSERV.<br>
<p>
Another ways to accomplish this goal would be an anonymous ftp site<br>
with associated mail server.  I'm not allowed to do this at CMU.<br>
<p>
A World Wide Web or Gopher server<br>
Both of these packages are near-incredible ways to access information,<br>
both text and graphics, all over the world, distributed among many <br>
platforms.  <br>
<p>
A fast SDA news capability--online connections for up-to-the minute news.<br>
<p>
On-line reference access to SDA research material such as library holdings.<br>
<p>
A newsgroup on Usenet<br>
------<br>
The board would make decisions on new services to be offered, <br>
provide guidance in finding new computing resources if they are needed,<br>
and help find ways to generate publicity for SDAnet.  <br>
<p>
Now, once everyone knows this, do those who wanted to be on the board<br>
still want to be, and did any who haven't volunteered yet want to do so?<br>

For some time I have wondered whether or not it would be feasible to <br>
hold a symposium on the benefits and potential benefits of electronic<br>
networking to the SDA church.  Some ideas that such a symposium would <br>
cover are:<br>
<p>
The network as a witnessing tool<br>
The network as a communication tool<br>
The network as a means of sharing resources<br>
The network as an education aid<br>
<p>
<p>
If you have ideas on other topics that a symposium should cover,<br>
please share them.  Also share your thoughts on whether such a symposium<br>
should be electronic or would actually bring everybody together into <br>
one place.<br>

Yes, there's a difference.<br>
<p>
As children, we learned that doing certain things could get us cookies,<br>
an extra hours worth of TV, a bicycle or any number of things.<br>
Now there is nothing wrong with those things in and of themselves,<br>
except maybe the cookie, the type of show one watches,  how one<br>
uses the bicycle, or the motives behind the deed.<br>
<p>
The same is with salvation.  Many will say in that day, well didn't we do<br>
*this* and didn't we do *that*?  We can pursue "salvation" (escape from<br>
hell) by doing all the right things.  But if our motives are off track, <br>
from the<br>
one, and only gate/way, the person of Jesus Christ, we are just as lost,<br>
as any "idolater", "sexual immoral", "greedy", "boastful", "liars."  And since<br>
I too am a SINNER saved by *grace* (a grant and not a loan = for you<br>
students) can't read a persons motive/heart, I leave the judging up to <br>
God.<br>

<i>&gt;reason and not the latter!</i><br>
<p>
<p>
	Your post is good.  However, I'd like to add that our affection can also be<br>
	obsessed with the letter of laws, neglecting the law's spirit.  Some call it<br>
	legalism.  In this, even the "very elect" can be deceived.  	There's an<br>
	excellent newspaper editorial which I clipped about the late Thurgood<br>
	Marshall's unending passion and love for the law, it's spirit.  If I <br>
find it I'll post<br>
	later... WITH copyright reference of course.<br>
<p>
	When I was at Southern College, and that majestic pipe organ was played,<br>
	sometimes my mind would wonder in worship to the instrament or musician.<br>
	Maybe we should not panic when this happens, but with Christ's help, try to<br>
	look deeper into the direction of the One these things (hopefully) are <br>
uplifting.<br>
	I _dare_ anyone to contemplate the goodness, righteousness, justice,<br>
	forgiveness and "eternalness" of God, while in the presence of nature,<br>
	or even in the huge stained-glass sanctuaries of our college, or university<br>
	campuses (organs and all), WITHOUT being spiritually moved.<br>

Our pastor has organized "under-shepherds".  He has split the church<br>
territory and area into several sections, and assigned a seasoned church<br>
member to be an "under-shepherd" to that area, to do visitations, etc. etc.<br>
Cheers<br>

Steve:<br>
<p>
This is not intended for SDAnet.  I've got a friend who is doing a PhD<br>
in Belgium (non-SDA friend), and he's wondering if there's some program<br>
already written which could facilitate research in neural networks.  If<br>
you have any information, I'd appreciate you letting me know, and I'll<br>
forward it to him.<br>
<p>
Thanks.<br>
<p>
Thanks also for your work on SDA-net.  I'd volunteer to be on the board,<br>
but don't know how long I'll be in the US.  I'll be here at least<br>
another year, if it's worthwile to you.<br>
<p>
Take care, and let's keep in touch.<br>
<p>

I am convinced that we within the Adventist subculture and the wider<br>
Christian community need to maintain our healthy (and even romantic!) notion<br>
of lifelong monagamy.  In addition to being given to us in the New Testament,<br>
it has proven to be the only prudent behavior in today's world of AIDS and<br>
other sexually transmitted diseases.  Where we fail miserably is in opening<br>
lines of communication between the generations which allow frank discussion<br>
of why this notion is so valuable.  Teens have many reasons for experimenting<br>
with sex ranging from desire, to curiosity, to asserting independence, to<br>
love, to peer pressure, to fear of losing a loved boyfriend/girlfriend etc. <br>
Teens will accept advice from adults but will reject out of hand<br>
paternalistic commands not accompanied by thorough explanation of the reasons<br>
why they are given.  After all, teens are formulating their own values and<br>
are challenging all values instilled by previous authority figures. <br>
<p>
I have no teenagers in my house.  Instead, my exposure to the issue is both<br>
personal as I formulate my own sexual behavior and professional as a<br>
gynecologist.  The following are some medical reasons why it is exceedingly<br>
unwise for teens to engage in sex outside of a committed monogamous<br>
relationship.<br>
1.  Sexually transmitted diseases:  Sexually active teens have a very high<br>
prevalance of STD's.  Human Papillomavirus (HPV), the virus which causes<br>
genital warts has been isolated in as many as 50% of women undergoing<br>
treatment in college student health service clinics.  Clearly, the rate of<br>
infection would be similiar if not higher in sexually active college men. <br>
This virus is also implicated in cervical carcinogenesis and has been found<br>
in &gt;90% of cervical cancer tumors.  Fortunately, the vast majority of HPV<br>
infections do not progress to cancer, but many of them do cause pap smear<br>
abnormalities necessitating frequent treatment.  2-3 million new cases of<br>
genital warts are diagnosed each year in the US.  To put this into<br>
perspective, in a non-epidemic year there are about 15 million cases of the<br>
"flu".  Thus, sexually active teens are roughly 1/7 as likely to get HPV as<br>
the flu.  (I realize the epidemiology is crude in this example, but hopefully<br>
the point was made that HPV is very common.)  A second scourge is Chlamydia,<br>
a tiny bacteria which can infect women without any symptoms.  This organism<br>
is particularly effective at damaging the fallopian tubes and uterus causing<br>
scarring and potential infertility.  This agent is unfortunately the MOST<br>
common agent spread sexually with about 5 million victims yearly in the US. <br>
(There are more cases of Chlamydia than there are pregnancies each year in<br>
the US!)  Chlamydia can also infect men, usually causing a white discharge<br>
and painful urination.  The most frightening STD, HIV virus infection is<br>
fortunately rather rare with typically 4/1000 Americans carrying the virus. <br>
The risk is actually higher however because most of the carriers are<br>
aggregated within the reproductive years.  Although most cases are still<br>
concentrated among gay men or IV drug users, heterosexual contact is the most<br>
rapidly growing route of infection.  Clearly the risk is low but not zero and<br>
the infection currently is incurable and eventually fatal.  Gonorrhea is<br>
transmitted to about 1/2 million new victims per year with similiar<br>
consequences as Chlamydia.  Of course, there are more diseases to consider<br>
but I think I have made my point regarding STD's!!!<br>
<p>
2.   Pregnancy: The US has the highest rate of unwanted pregnancy in the<br>
developed world despite having access to virtually all modern contraceptives.<br>
 Christian and Adventist teens are obviously not immune to this epidemic.  It<br>
has been estimated that out of the 4.5 million pregnancies yearly, 3.0<br>
million are unexpected and of that 50% proceed to abortion.  Regardless of<br>
your position on the abortion debate, all would agree that 1.5 million<br>
abortions, most ofwhich would be preventable by adequate contraceptive<br>
practice, are a national tragedy.  Teens are at particular risk of pregnancy<br>
for several reasons: <br>
  a. poor planning-many teens refuse to get or use contraceptives because<br>
this would admit to planning to have sexual relations.  Premeditated sex is<br>
"worse" than impulsive sex.  For this reason, many teens are unprepared for<br>
the inevitable consquences.  Unprotected midcycle intercourse carries a 17%<br>
risk of pregnancy.  Teenage women need to be told that contraceptive<br>
techniques are available which can be taken AFTER intercourse which will<br>
reduce the risk to about 2% if they have had unprotected sex, however this<br>
must be taken within 2 days of intercourse.<br>
  b. irregular ovulation-In many teenage women the pituitary and ovary are<br>
still maturing.  This causes irregular and often unpredictable ovulation and<br>
menses.  This makes it even more difficult than usual to predict when she is<br>
at highest risk for getting pregnant.<br>
  c. feeling of invincibility (i.e. "it can't happen to me").  Unfortunately,<br>
this illusion is not shattered until pregnancy occurs for many teenage women.<br>
<p>
3.  Cervical cancer.  Women who initiate sexual activity early seem to be at<br>
a greater risk for cervical cancer.  This is probably related to the HPV<br>
virus infecting a cervix that is not yet mature.  In the immature cervix<br>
there is a greater area of tissue which is rapidly replicating.  This<br>
apparently places the young woman at increased risk.<br>
<p>
4.  Psychological/developmental factors.  I don't have hard data on these<br>
risks, however Pediatricians I have spoken to are convinced that the average<br>
American young person achieves biological maturity several years before<br>
psychological maturity.  This adds to the difficulties in responsibly using<br>
their sexuality adding to the problems listed in #1 and #2.<br>
<p>
Teens may hear all of this information and be overwhelmed, but there is<br>
compelling reasons why the smart teens will either avoid sex or, if having<br>
sex, will take appropriate measure to minimize the risks associated with<br>
non-monogamous sex.  Much of this info is equally appropriate to any age, not<br>
just to teenagers of course.  As an aside, many teens or singles practice<br>
what has been called "serial monogamy" which means that they are having<br>
sexual relations with only the person they are dating at the time, but when<br>
the current relationship dissolves, a new partner is taken as the next<br>
relationship begins.  This practice, rather than being somewhat safe is<br>
probably more risky than "sleeping around" where persons have intermittent<br>
encounters with more than one partner.  The reason for this is that most<br>
sexually transmitted diseases are not exquistely infectious.  That is,<br>
repeated exposure to any sexually transmitted agent increases the probability<br>
of transmission.  As a consequence, persons practicing "serial monogamy"<br>
maximize the chance that they will acquire any STDs from their previous<br>
partner and then pass it along to the next partner.<br>
<p>
For those of us within the Christian and Adventist community, we have God's<br>
word asking us to submit all of us, including our bodies, to Jesus.  This is<br>
exceedingly difficult to do, particularly in romantically tempting<br>
circumstances.  Regardless of the medical risks, our goal is to follow what<br>
God asks us to do.  The health risks simply remind us that His requests are<br>
in our own best long term interest and are given to us because He loves us! <br>
<p>
Way back at the beginning of this post (remember!!!) I lamented the lack of<br>
communication between generations regarding reasons for abstinence.  I hope<br>
SDA academies are willing to be frank about the consequences of poor choices<br>
regarding sexuality before those consequences occur rather than waiting to<br>
discipline students who have made poor choices.<br>
<p>

There has been a good response to the call for a board, and we have a<br>
good mix of people with varied experience.  I will announce the names<br>
tomorrow.<br>
Others that want to join are still welcome.  Seven have joined so far.<br>

I think the symposium is an excellent idea.  We already communicate over<br>
the net, so more of that, while helping refine ideas, might not break<br>
new ground.  There is something to be said for eye-to-eye contact (in<br>
reading e-mail I often miss the non-verbal cues and communication).<br>
If it's important to communicate with those not on the net (and I think<br>
it is), an actual (rather than virtual?) symposium might be more useful.<br>
It seems that a lot of people (including myself) still need education on<br>
what is possible before implementation can begin.  I can think of a<br>
number of potential audiences:<br>
<p>
Church leaders.  I don't think most of them have any idea of what's<br>
going on here (at least if my casual conversations at the GC are any<br>
indication).  However, I believe a number of them might be quite<br>
interested.  For example, I understand that Folkenberg is quite<br>
interested in new technology.  For this group, a meeting at the GC (much<br>
as I hate to suggest it!) might be best.  This could include editors and<br>
some educators.<br>
<p>
Editors.  A subgroup of the above.  I spoke to the Adventist Editors<br>
International meeting last year in MD, and I know there's interest in at<br>
least some of these issues.  They are scattered around the country, but<br>
they do have an annual conference (this year in Madison or Milwaukee,<br>
WI, I believe).  <br>
<p>
Educators.  An obvious group, though there is no obvious conference or<br>
place.  Years ago, there used to be quinquennial meetings of SDA<br>
educators, but that was lost in budget cuts (unfortunately).<br>
<p>
Librarians (of course!).  Many of these issues are of interest to us,<br>
and some have already been discussed at our annual Conference<br>
(Association of SDA Librarians).  This summer the meeting will be at<br>
Canadian Union College, next summer here at Andrews, 1995 at Newbold<br>
just prior to GC in Utrecht.  I expect that ASDAL would gladly<br>
co-sponsor something of this type.  We have found that (exclusive of<br>
travel) meetings can be held quite inexpensively on SDA campuses in the<br>
summer.<br>
<p>
Given our international network membership, I am sure that if we were to<br>
have an actual meeting, we would still want to include discussions on<br>
the net, as I am sure many individuals would not be able to attend an<br>
actual symposium.<br>
<p>
These are just a few ideas that come to mind.  We must be careful that<br>
we don't limit ourselves to "blue sky" thinking but remember the need<br>
for educating people (particularly those who control the money we want<br>
to spend!).<br>

Steve,<br>
<p>
I have been a long time user of the internet and for the last 4 months<br>
I have been without a connection due to a job change.  I just got my own<br>
connection from a local supplier.  I felt completly lost with out<br>
a connection to the outside world!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;For some time I have wondered whether or not it would be feasible to </i><br>
<i>&gt;hold a symposium on the benefits and potential benefits of electronic</i><br>
<p>
Most people who have never really used or had access to the data highways<br>
don't understand just how many there are.  First is just the ability to<br>
send e-mail quickly and at a _very_ low cost to the end user.  My dad,<br>
who lives in Colorado, I got hooked up through Denver U and now we<br>
can send mail for free.  And it gets there much faster than US SNAIL mail.<br>
<p>
The bigger items, however, are on-line database access.  I have often thought<br>
how nice it would be to have the EGW stuff ftp'able.  I figure one day if no<br>
one else does, I'll get the CD and make it available.  The church could also<br>
provide forums, on various topics, plus transcripts from import events.<br>
<p>
Users then would also have access to usenet news.  This is, in some cases,<br>
where the trenches are.  Talk.religion.misc, and soc.religion.christian<br>
have been covering some very interesting threads for the few years I've<br>
been reading them.  I have made some on-line friends across the world<br>
from reading posts and responding to them.<br>
<p>
As for the initial investment to get started, it would be small.  Most of<br>
our universities and institutions already have access.  It would merely mean<br>
expanding the scope of services provided and allowing access to the "public".<br>
<p>
I would be behind this kind of adventure all the way, I'd even consider<br>
being in front of it. 8-)<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;One aspect of this topic that has not been mentioned is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;influence of our diet and health practices on our sex drive.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I believe that the health counsels of Ellen White, if followed,</i><br>
<i>&gt;would do a lot towards helping us to keep this under control.</i><br>
<i>&gt;A simple, natural diet helps to restrain the ``animal passions.''</i><br>
<i>&gt;Also, I think getting plenty of sunlight  helps to milden our</i><br>
<i>&gt;disposition, and outdoor exercise has a similar effect.</i><br>
<i>&gt;High fat and sugar and protein intake tends to have the opposite</i><br>
<i>&gt;effect.  I can't give scientific evidence for this but it has</i><br>
<i>&gt;been borne out in my own experience and seems to be supported</i><br>
<i>&gt;by the testimonies of Sister White.  There seems to be a</i><br>
<i>&gt;similar correlation with the control of temper.  Of course,</i><br>
<i>&gt;this doesn't mean that the temptation will go away.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
I know that this won't be popular, but, how about controlling<br>
our access to the TV?  There is such a culture in the TV that<br>
is influencing our young people, how about teaching them when<br>
to actually turn the channel?  How about teaching them to deal<br>
with the "evil" that TV can be?<br>
<p>
How about just recognizing that evil for what it is?  The TV<br>
ads and their scantily clad ladies and men are ruses to <br>
inflame youthful passions (and those of us in that are only<br>
a few years removed from their youth also!!).  Tell them that<br>
the women and men on the television and in the theater are<br>
NOT the real people they purport to be.  That they are actors<br>
just reading a script.  That real men and women do not react<br>
in the manner that they do.<br>
<p>
Real preparation for a real world.  Perhaps that should be <br>
our motto in teaching our youth, both in sabbath school and <br>
in our acadamies.<br>

The question of "what is a cult church" really boils down to a cult being<br>
any church that the mainline churches are uncomfortable with with<br>
regards to their theology.  Its not mainline theology.  As I recall,<br>
that is basically what I found near the beginning of Walter Martin's book.<br>
And other "cult" critics would basically agree.<br>
<p>
By that definition the Protestant Reformers were a bunch of cultists<br>
simply because the Catholic Church was "the church" of that erra.<br>
Also, early Christians were cultists in the context of Judaism.  So,<br>
really, being a cultist is not necessarily a bad thing.<br>
<p>
Those who are members of the mainline churches can look down from their<br>
balconies and think of us as cultists.  But the Bible tells me that<br>
the majority will go out through the broad gate, only a few entered<br>
the ark, etc.  So, if cultist means "in a minority" doctrinally, then<br>
that sounds like a plus -- but of course no proof at all of truth.<br>
Holding a majority position does not make it wrong, but urges caution.<br>
Holding a minority position does not make it right, either way, check<br>
it out thoroughly.<br>

The most current definition of "cult" that I have found, runs along<br>
the line of.."A cult denies the divenity of Christ, and swears allegance<br>
to a particular person"  Some examples:<br>
Jim Jones, L.Ron Hubbard, Moons followers etc.  The PRIMARY reason that<br>
some people label Adventists as a Cult, is because of our emphysis on<br>
EGW and inspiration.  They see a paralell between that, and Mary Baker<br>
Eddy, J.J, L.R.H etc.   However, the first part of the definition<br>
disqualifies S.D.A's as being a cult.  If you've been sensitive to church<br>
directions, you will notice a de-emphysis of EGW has been taking place for<br>
about the last 10-12 years in the Adventist church.  We have been distancing<br>
ourselfs from this, in order to diminish the force of the "cult label".<br>
I am not going to get into the issue of inspiration vs non-inspiration,<br>
but EGW has not played to well to the world the way many Adventists have<br>
mis-used what she has written.  How many times have you been "hit over<br>
the head" with EGW??!  The Adventist church is a thinking mans church.<br>
Unfortunatly, we tend to forget that new christians need to be fed the<br>
milk of the word, not the meat, and thus "think" them right out the back<br>
door.  I drove by the River Bend Baptist church today, here in Austin,<br>
and could not help contrasting it to our church.  The church campus<br>
covers about 10 acres, with at least 5 of those in parking lots, and is<br>
generaly packed full on Sunday.  It has a large sign out front advertising<br>
the fact that it is a "healing fellowship of Baptists".  On the other hand<br>
we have a church sitting on a couple of acres, that can seat 300 or so, and<br>
we have 200 people on the books, with around 50 regulars.  We are doing<br>
something wrong as a church (both globally and locally).<br>
Cheers<br>

I'd like some good advice from you Adventists on the net.<br>
<p>
     I was recently asked if I might be willing to serve as the<br>
campaign manager for Steve Dillon, who is running for Secretary of<br>
State for Indiana in 1994.  I was of course very honored, but its not<br>
a straightforward decision.  Here are some questions I have for you<br>
all:<br>
<p>
1.  Is it proper for Adventists to be doing this sort of thing? <br>
<p>
2.  What are the relevent EGW quotes on the subject?  Do you think they<br>
    hold for today or were just for her time?<br>
<p>
3.  Steve Dillon will be running not as a Democrat or Republican, but a<br>
    Libertarian.  I believe that the Libertarian Party is the best party<br>
    in America today and I'm proud to call myself a Libertarian, but I<br>
    am a Seventh-day Adventist first and a Libertarian second.  Do you<br>
    think it would help, hinder, or have no effect whatsoever on the<br>
    reputation of the SDA church to have one of its members being both<br>
    a visible, activist Adventist and a visible, activist Libertarian?<br>
<p>
Thanks for all your responses, and please pray for me as I consider<br>
this decision.<br>

Just wanted to respond to what woody said:<br>
<p>
        "The Adventist church is a thinking mans church."<br>
<p>
Actually, this points out one of the problems with the SDA Church at present.<br>
The role of women in the church remains nebulous.  They still haven't decided<br>
to ordain women even though women can perform the same duties as men.  The<br>
church fails to offer a supportive program for single parents (almost always<br>
women).  Many SDA churches still won't let a woman say congregational prayer<br>
or speak from the platform.  Some won't let them teach a Sabbath School class<br>
in the adult division (they can teach kids but not adults!).  The church doesn't<br>
know what to do about single women (without kids).  There's no formal program<br>
for women that has a spiritual or social thrust.  Most SDA churches no longer<br>
have Dorcas Societies which mostly offered service opportunities for elderly<br>
women.  The church rarely addresses women's issues in sermons, sabbath school<br>
quarterlies, or church publications.<br>
<p>
In fact, the SDA church as an organization seems to believe that only men can<br>
think.  So yes, the Adventist church is a thinking man's church.  Unfortunately,<br>
with more than half the members being women, it is failing to address the<br>
needs of women in any meaningful way.<br>

Why not?  It's high time that SDAs become leaders in the community.  Why always<br>
leave that up to others of varying beliefs?  View it as a terrifica opportunity.<br>
But along with it will be tremendous temptations!  You should ask yourself how<br>
strong a person you think you can be with God's help?<br>
<p>

<p>
Principles obtained from EGW writings are relevant for today.  But don't always<br>
take her at face value...she wrote once that you shouldn't buy a bicycle.  That<br>
doesn't mean no one should buy one, but at the time they cost a great deal<br>
(still can today if you get into the big leagues).  The principle (+/-) is don't<br>
buy something that costs alot more than you can afford that isn't absolutely<br>
critical.<br>

<i>&gt;     reputation of the SDA church to have one of its members being both</i><br>
<i>&gt;     a visible, activist Adventist and a visible, activist Libertarian?</i><br>
<p>
The effect you have as a highly visible SDA is entirely up to you.  You can<br>
correctly represent the church buy honoring God's laws as interpreted by our<br>
church or you can disregard them.  I would see the Sabbath issue as prominent in<br>
my mind as a big hurdle for you to work out.  But if you can be up front with<br>
them and get in writing a statement that allows you to avoid work on the<br>
Sabbath, that can be a terrific witness for others, especially if God can work<br>
through you and bless your work.<br>

I FEEL THAT ADVENTISTS HAVE NOT ONLY THE RIGHT, BUT THE RESPONSIBILTY TO BE IN POSITIONS OF POWER. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE HAS COME A<br>
MINDSET INTO THE CHURCH THAT GOVERNMENT IS EVIL; THAT WE SHOULD REFRAIN FROMPOLITCAL ACTIVITIES EXCEPT THOSE THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED<br>
AS LOBBYING FOR OUR RIGHTS. I RECENTLY HEARD A SERMON THAT WAS DELIVERED BY OUR PASTOR ON "RELIGIOUS LIBERTY" THAT WAS DEFINITELY<br>
TAINTED WITH THAT MINDSET. HE WAS SUBJECTING THE CONGREGATION TO DISINFORMATION THAT WAS DISSEMINATED BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN<br>
WAY -- OOPS! I'M SORRY -- AMERICANS UNITED FOR SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE. TO ALL OF YOU UNBELIEVERS IN THE TRUTH OF JUDICIAL RESTRAINT<br>
AND ORIGINAL CONSTITUTIONAL INTENT, THE JUDICIAL ACTIVISM THAT CAME UP WITH THE CONVOLUTED CONCEPT OF THE "WALL OF SEPARATION" IS OF MORE<br>
DANGER TO OUR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY THAN JERRY FALLWELL COULD EVER BE. GETTING BACK TO MY POINT OF EVIL GOVERNMENT -- GOVERNMENTS ARE AMORAL<br>
INSTITUTIONS AND REFLECT THE VALUES OF THE PEOPLE SERVING IN OFFICE. I AM HAPPY TO POINT OUT THAT HERE IN MARYLAND WE ELECTED A SDA<br>
CONGRESSMAN (CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN, PRAISE THE LORD) TO CONGRESS BY THE NAME OF ROSCOE BARTLETT. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT HE IS<br>
THE THIRD SDA IN CONGRESS IN HISTORY. I PLAN TO BE THE FOURTH. THOSE WHO WOULD DISAGREE WITH OUR PARTICIPATION IN POLITICS SHOULD<br>
ASK THEMSELVES HOW THE JEWISH NATION WOULD HAVE GOTTEN ALONG WITHOUT HIGHLY PLACED PEOPLE LIKE DANIEL OR ESTHER.<br>
JUST ONE NOTE IN CLOSING, THOUGH. I AM DISAPPOINTED IN MY FELLOW BRETHEN ALIGNING HIMSELF WITH THE LIBERTINE PARTY. I DON'T FEEL THAT<br>
LEGALIZING NARCOTICS, PROSTITUTION, AND OTHER SUCH OUTRAGEOUS ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE A GOOD PLATFORM FOR AN ADVENTIST TO RUN ON.<br>

I was going to disagree with Woody's definition of a cult (don't believe in<br>
God) so I decided to reseach it a bit.  I found a recent book (1986) which<br>
examines both the definition of a cult and discusses the major cults in America.<br>
<p>
        Melton, J. Gordon.  ENCYCLOPEDIC HANDBOOD OF CULTS IN AMERICA.<br>
        New York: Garland Publ, 1986.<br>
<p>
What defines a cult depends on the perspective one is using.  Melton presents<br>
three definitions:  the social science definition, the Christian polemicist<br>
definition, and the secular anti-cultist definition.<br>
<p>
SOCIAL SCIENCE DEFINITION OF A CULT<br>
<p>
        Social scientists distinguish 3 types of religious bodies:  churches,<br>
sects, and cults.  A Church is defined as a large religious denomination<br>
characterized by their inclusive approach to life and their identification<br>
with the prevailing culture.  A sect is a body of believers that has broken<br>
away from a church.  They tend to follow the denominations in most patterns<br>
but are more strict in doctrine and behavioral demands placed upon members.<br>
Sects emphasize their separation and distinctiveness from the larger culture<br>
and typically focus on dress codes, moral conduct, personal piety, and anti-war<br>
activities.  A cult according to sociologists is "religition innovation within<br>
culture".  Cults don't follow cultural norms and may be exagerated sects.<br>
<p>
CHRISTIAN POLEMICISTS DEFINITION OF A CULT<br>
<p>
        They define a cult as deviation from orthodox faith.  One of the first<br>
was Jan Karel Van Baalen (1938).  He divided religion into two basic groups:<br>
those who ascribe to humans the ability to accomplish their own salvation and<br>
those who ascribe that ability to God.  Josh McDowell and Don Stewart:  "A<br>
cult is a perversion, a distortion of Biblical Christianity, and as such,<br>
rejects the historical teachings of the Christian Church."  Any group of<br>
believers that departs from orthodox Christianity is considered a cult.<br>
(Walter Martin is of this group).  Unfortunately, this group doesn't consider<br>
cults of NonChristian origin to be cults because their definition is intricately<br>
tied to Christianity.<br>
<p>
SECULAR ANTI-CULTIST'S Characteristics of a Cult (Marcia Rudin)<br>
<p>
1.  cult members swear total allegiance to an all-powerful leader who they<br>
    believe to be the Messiah<br>
2.  Rational thought is discouraged or forbidden<br>
3.  Deceptive recruitment techniques<br>
4.  cult weakens the follower psychologically by making him/her depend upon<br>
    the group to solve his/her problems<br>
5.  manipulates guilt to their advantage<br>
6.  cult leaders make all career and life decisions of members<br>
7.  cults exist only for their own material survival and make false promises<br>
    to work to improve society<br>
8.  members work fulltime for the group for little or no pay<br>
9.  members are isolated from the outside world and any reality testing it<br>
    could provide<br>
10. cults are antiwoman, antichild, and antifamily<br>
11. cults are apocalyptic and believe themselves to be the remnant who will<br>
    survive the soon-approaching end of the world<br>
12. cults follow "ends justify the means" philosophy<br>
13. cults, particularly in regard to their finances, are shrouded in secrecy<br>
14. there is frequently an aura of or potential for violence around cults<br>
<p>
Interestingly, this book does NOT cover the Seventh-day Adventist Church.  The<br>
author apparently does not consider it to be a cult.  By the Christian<br>
polemicist definition, the SDA church certainly qualifies as a SECT.  Some may<br>
think that the SDA church also has some of the characteristics of a CULT from<br>
the secular anit-cultist definition:  anyone who has ever worked for the SDA<br>
church may attest that they work fulltime for the group for little pay.  #11<br>
certainly applies with "remnant" being a favorite word for SDAs.  And some may<br>
think that guilt is manipulated to the church's advantage.  But 3/14 doesn't<br>
qualify the SDA as a cult.  Ironically, J. Gordon Melton's companion book,<br>
BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY OF AMERICAN CULT AND SECT LEADERS (1986) includes<br>
entries for William Miller, Ellen Gould Harmon White, and other SDA leaders.<br>
(Probably as a SECT).  He also points out that both the Jehovah's Witnesses<br>
and the Worldwide Church of God began as splinter groups from the SDA Church.<br>
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the Church of Christ<br>
Scientist, and many others are still designated CULTS is his books.<br>
<p>
Hope this is helpful in the discussion of What is a cult?<br>

I think that you may not be aware of some SDA churchs.  I can only speak based on<br>
what I have seen in our local church and those I have visited...<br>

<i>&gt; They still haven't decided</i><br>
<i>&gt; to ordain women even though women can perform the same duties as men.</i><br>
<p>
I think they have decided since I know of women pastors of large churches.  I<br>
could be wrong on this.  Its only a matter of time before more women will come<br>
through the channels of theology training and you will start to see more and<br>
more women in minister roles.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The</i><br>
<i>&gt; church fails to offer a supportive program for single parents (almost always</i><br>
<i>&gt; women).</i><br>
<p>
What kind of support do you have in mind?  I agree that they need to be accepted<br>
as any other fellow Christian brother/sister.  In our church I believe they are.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Many SDA churches still won't let a woman say congregational prayer</i><br>
<i>&gt; or speak from the platform.</i><br>
<p>
Our little suburban church lets woman speak from up front.  The Outreach person<br>
is a woman and speaks up front often.  Our church had a missionary woman have<br>
the serman time just recently.  And I would also imagine that if any qualified<br>
woman wanted to have the serman, they could.  Fact is, I don't think too many<br>
woman or men in our church are anxious to get up and give the serman...they<br>
leave that up to the pastors, who do happen to be male.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Some won't let them teach a Sabbath School class</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the adult division (they can teach kids but not adults!).</i><br>
<p>
Of the three adult SS classes in our little church, two are lead by woman and<br>
the third is the pastor's class.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The church doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; know what to do about single women (without kids).</i><br>
<p>
What should they do?  They don't do anything special for single men either.  I<br>
am aware of a "singles" group in our area that is fairly active and advertises<br>
in many of the local church bulletins about activities.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There's no formal program</i><br>
<i>&gt; for women that has a spiritual or social thrust.</i><br>
<p>
None for men either.  So why should women have special programs that don't exist<br>
for the men either?  Maybe both are needed?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Most SDA churches no longer</i><br>
<i>&gt; have Dorcas Societies which mostly offered service opportunities for elderly</i><br>
<i>&gt; women.</i><br>
<p>
Our church does have such a thing but it is called Community Services and is<br>
VERY active in local community service.  They are tied in with a half dozen<br>
other local churchs (of other faiths) who also help out in a joint effort for<br>
the benefit of the community.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The church rarely addresses women's issues in sermons, sabbath school</i><br>
<i>&gt; quarterlies, or church publications.</i><br>
<p>
Again, I don't see men's issues addressed in sermons, SS Quarterlies, and church<br>
publications either.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In fact, the SDA church as an organization seems to believe that only men can</i><br>
<i>&gt; think.</i><br>
<p>
I think this is abit of an overstatement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So yes, the Adventist church is a thinking man's church.  Unfortunately,</i><br>
<i>&gt; with more than half the members being women, it is failing to address the</i><br>
<i>&gt; needs of women in any meaningful way.</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately, the SDA church comes from a predominantly male oriented<br>
historical past (in terms of roles in church activity leadership positions).<br>
 But this is not really of SDA origin as much as it is from the conservative<br>
puritan background that our early pioneers were part of.  100-150 years ago,<br>
much of society operated with the notion that women were to take a back seat to<br>
the man...to be seen and not heard, etc.  This was not unique to SDAs.<br>
<p>
Yes, the SDA church has been abit behind the pace of society at large, but that<br>
is typical of them in many other areas, too.  Look at the churchs view on<br>
Sabbath observance, music, entertainment, dress codes, etc and compare then and<br>
now.  There is still room for progress, but I think they have come along way.<br>

Why don't you move down here to Texas?  Lets see... We have 3 women <br>
adult SS teachers, 2 ordained women elders, and a couple of SS superintendants<br>
plus over half of the church board is made up of women.<br>
<p>
Our church has a rather unique sabbath school setup, that works EXTREMELY<br>
well for us.  We have 2 adult SS classes, with 8 rotating teachers.  The<br>
teachers rotate on a weekly basis.  I am the swing teacher, that is, I fill<br>
in for other teachers if they can't make it.  One of the women elders<br>
(June Ayers) also is a teacher, and she has found the load heavy enough, that<br>
she has decided to swap off with me for half of her scheduled rotations.<br>
<p>
Our women elders are precisely equal to our male elders in both duties,<br>
responsibilities, and other areas.  It is great.<br>
<p>
Please note that I did not say "the thinking males church".  Perhaps<br>
"the thinking peoples church" would have been much more appropriate<br>
for what I meant.  As a church, we tend to drop heavy doctrines on people<br>
when they are trying and struggling with just realizing what Christian<br>
living is about.  We tend to feed the new members with much more than<br>
the "milk" of the word.  True, sometimes we find a true intellectual<br>
and they can handle it, but the majority can't, and as a result we lose<br>
way to many out the back door.  The net result is a slow accumulation<br>
of intellectuals in the church.<br>
<p>
Cheers<br>

Yeah for the Libertarians.  I've voted Lib in the last 4 elections (except<br>
that I voted for Perot this time.)<br>
<p>
I feel, and it is my understanding that we are to try to make the world<br>
a better place.  If this includes running for government, where you might<br>
have some influence, then do it. If I had a chance I would run for congress<br>
or other office.  I see no conflict with ones christian experience.  However,<br>
one would not be representing God correctly, to run a negative campaign.  It<br>
is never appropriate to deliberately hurt someone's feelings. This might be<br>
considered a mitigating circumstance.  I have run for city council several<br>
times, and very nearly got elected the first time.  I belive that I can/could<br>
change some things for the better, if I could get on the city council.<br>
<p>
It is important however, that you stand up for your principles.  Let me give<br>
you an example.  I worked for 18 months selling computers and laser printers<br>
for a store here in town.  I told my boss up front, that I would NOT be doing<br>
any show duty from sundown Fri. thru sundown Sat.  Additionaly, I told him that<br>
I absolutly would not attend any function for any reason where alcholic drinks<br>
were served or consumed.  I was sucessfully able to maintain this in spite<br>
of some pressure.  I found that he was accommodating.  I did attend a christmas<br>
party once.  He arranged to have the happy hour/cocktail bar open about 30 to<br>
45 minutes late, so I would be able to enjoy some of the food.  when the bar<br>
opened, I left.  I would not like to think of the kind of pressure that one<br>
might be subjected to when running a public campaign, but just as I think<br>
it is our duty as Christians to vote, and attempt to make the world better,<br>
I think that if you can successfully maintain your Christian experience and<br>
hold public office, by all means do so.  If you are asked to manage a<br>
campaign, go for it, if you think you can do it, and just stick to your<br>
principles.<br>
<p>
Cheers<br>
Woody<br>

Clearly I am not in a position to *properly* understand what it is like<br>
to be a female SDA. But I'd like to say two things anyway.<br>
<p>
1)	In my church women contribute a great deal; maybe they don't<br>
	appear up front *quite* as often as men, but it must be close.<br>
	We had a woman head elder for a while, and she did a superb<br>
	job coordinating, managing and leading our church of &gt;1000<br>
	over the time she had that office. <br>
<p>
2)	Most of the negative comments I have heard regarding the<br>
	ordination of women, or even regarding women leading out<br>
	in worship etc., have come from women. I don't think it was<br>
	due to societal role-sustaining either.<br>
<p>
One thing which does need to be addressed is the representation of<br>
women in the governing of the worldwide church. This issue goes further<br>
than just a women's thing, though.<br>

On what do we base the claim that the SDA church is the thinking person's<br>
church??<br>
<p>
Is it because we encourage each other to search the Scriptures for new<br>
light? Is it because we are so open to new ideas regarding issues such<br>
as origins? Is it because we are so creative in thinking up new ways<br>
to reach out to others, and eagerly adopt promising and innovative<br>
schemes? Or maybe because we encourage our youth to question their<br>
faith, search things out for themselves, and turn their inherited<br>
Adventism into Christianity?<br>
<p>
Yes, we are making progress, but we have a *long* way to go. <br>
