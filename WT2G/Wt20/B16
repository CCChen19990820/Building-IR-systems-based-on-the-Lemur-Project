<CENTER><h2>New CRC Book Frees Seniors <br>Held Captive
by the Age Lobby</h2></CENTER>
<P>
 WASHINGTON -- Older Americans who join seniors advocacy groups
like the AARP are often attracted by insurance deals, credit card
offers and colorful publications.  But a new <B>Capital Research
Center</B> book entitled <U>Frightening America's Elderly:  How
the Age Lobby Holds Seniors Captive</U> shows seniors they are
really imprisoned by a rich and powerful lobby that promotes wasteful
government programs while taking tax dollars for itself.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;Establishment seniors groups have become as harmful and
counterproductive as the welfare state itself.  They have a vested
financial stake in maintaining the status quo, even if it leads
to the bankruptcy of programs that seniors depend on,&quot; writes
author and Loyola College of Maryland economist Thomas J. DiLorenzo.
 <BR>
<P>
 The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and dozens
of lesser-known organizations that make up the age lobby have
become expert at exploiting the fears and needs of the elderly
to build their own power.  This power comes courtesy of taxpayers.
 In 1993, the federal government gave AARP $86 million to show
seniors how to find jobs and do their taxes.  Yet a year later,
AARP itself had to pay the IRS $135 million in taxes and penalties
for a decade of business activities the government deemed unrelated
to its nonprofit mission.  AARP's 1994 earnings on the sale of
insurance, pharmaceuticals and auto-club services totaled $191
million.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;The reader will come away from this text knowing far more
than even most AARP members do about the nature of that organization,&quot;
writes preface author<B> Sen. Alan K. Simpson</B> (R-WY).  Simpson,
chairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Social Security
and Family Policy, held hearings investigating the AARP's business
and lobbying practices.  &quot;As the possessor of a sizable stack
of chaotic, random and disorganized material about the AARP, I
commend Tom DiLorenzo and the Capital Research Center for condensing
this serpentine tale into a direct and comprehensible tract.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
 Recently, AARP and friends raised their taxpayer-funded voices
loud enough to drown out reports of the impending bankruptcy of
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  Trustees of these three
federal trust funds, on which most elderly rely, report that America's
aging population will empty the coffers faster than the smaller,
working-age population can re-fill them.  But the seniors lobby
falsely labeled efforts to save the system by slowing growth as
an attempt to &quot;cut&quot; benefits.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;These special interest lobbyists whose paychecks are tied
to failed welfare-state programs are stalling innovative reforms.
 <U>Frightening America's Elderly</U>  alerts members of these
groups that their support is contributing to the decline of the
American way of life,&quot; said Capital Research Center President
Terrence Scanlon.<BR>
<P>
 <U>Frightening America's Elderly:  How the Age Lobby Holds Seniors
Captive</U> explores the activities of the coalition of seniors
advocates that DiLorenzo calls the &quot;dependency lobby&quot;:
 AARP's unfair business practices; the National Council of Senior
Citizens' labor union ties; the Gray Panthers' socialist agenda;
and others.  It also heralds the more recent formation of a new
generation of seniors groups that emphasize voluntarism, consumer
choice and fiscal responsibility.
<P>
 
<P>
 To order <U>Frightening America's Elderly:  How the Age Lobby
Holds Seniors Captive</U>, send a check or money order for $15
to Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street N.W., Suite 800, Washington,

<CENTER><h2>New Monthly <I>Culture Watch</I></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>Is &quot;True Alternative Arts and Culture
Coverage&quot;</h2><BR></CENTER>
<P>
 WASHINGTON -- Capital Research Center in June begins publishing
<I>Culture Watch</I>, a new monthly newsletter which Editor
Laurence Jarvik calls &quot;true alternative arts and culture
coverage, highlighting those who have been sidelined by the shock
artists who have demoralized the intellectual community.&quot;
 <BR>
<P>
 &quot;We intend to raise the profile of those who defy the tide
of political correctness and stand up for the traditional values
of society,&quot; said Laurence Jarvik, Ph.D., Capital Research
Center cultural studies fellow and <I>Culture Watch</I> editor.
<BR>
<P>
 Every month, <I>Culture Watch</I><B> </B>will spotlight trends,
ideas and personalities that enrich the arts and cultural life.
 The June issue profiles Frederick Stocken, &quot;Britain's most
backward-looking composer.&quot;  Stocken is a musician dedicated
to classical musical ideals, despite the opposition of an avant-garde
power structure supported by public funds.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;The official guardians of the English music establishment
obviously were out of touch with their audience when they rejected
Stocken for his adherence to traditional standards -- a composer
who ultimately created a best-selling recording widely embraced
because of its harmonious melody,&quot; Jarvik said.<BR>
<P>
 Subsequent issues of <I>Culture Watch</I> will feature Maureen
Dowd, feisty <I>New York Times</I> columnist;  Professor Alan
Sokal, the NYU professor who discredited the field of cultural
studies by publishing an article challenging the law of gravity;
Mrs. Eugene Casey, who single-handedly donated $18 million to
give the Washington Opera a new home; and Will Fitzhugh, editor
of <I>The Concord Review</I>, a journal written by high school
students devoted to non-PC interpretations of American history.
 Trend stories will include an analysis of how Republicans are
portrayed in pop culture; and a look at the aftermath of Senator
Bob Dole's attack on Hollywood.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;America's moral standards have strayed so far from decency
that the artists who believe in the positive aesthetic value of
their work have been outcast by their colleagues.  <I>Culture
Watch</I> is a forum for these creators,&quot; said Capital Research
Center President Terrence Scanlon.<BR>
<P>
 <I>Culture Watch</I> will be Capital Research Center's fifth
monthly newsletter. It complements the institutional focus of<I>
Foundation Watch</I>, a newsletter that monitors the activities
of private foundations and analyzes their impact on American society.
 CRC launched <I>Foundation Watch</I>, also edited by Jarvik,
in February.<BR>
<P>
 CRC's other existing newsletters are <I>Organization Trends</I>,
which monitors advocacy organizations; <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I>,
which provides fresh perspectives on current trends and issues
in philanthropy; and <I>Philanthropy, Culture and Society</I>,
which examines the impact of philanthropy on American cultural
institutions and traditions.

<FONT SIZE=5>Inside the Council on Foundations &quot;Fishbowl&quot;:
How Foundation Executives Wash Each Other's Brains</FONT>
<P>
by Laurence Jarvik<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The foundation world is deeply into self-examination.
 A num ber of recent events _ President Clinton's signing of the
welfare reform bill, passage of the California Civil Rights Initiative,
the bitter legislative struggle over the Istook amendment to limit
federally-subsidized lobbying, and Republican retention of both
houses of Congress _ have led top foundation leaders across the
country to return to the query first posed by Admiral Stockdale:
&quot;Who am I?  Why am I here?&quot;  Since the May 1996 annual
gathering in Atlanta of the Council on Foundations [see <I>Foundation
Watch </I>vol. 1, no. 5 &quot;The Council on Foundations Message
to America: The Era of Lady Bountiful is Over'] foundation staff
and executives have been meeting, and meeting, and meeting.  They
have gathered together in affinity groups and planning sessions,
attended workshops and made on-site visits, and endlessly reconfigured
conference table and chair arrangements to facilitate dialogue,
optimize understanding, and in general decide what to do next.
 </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To see how foundation grantmakers wrestle with challenges
they face<I> Foundation Watch </I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>attended an unprecedented &quot;National Symposium
on Foundations and the Public Sector&quot; held in the Dupont
Circle Hotel in Washington, D.C. on November 14 and 15.  We were
also at an October session of the Communications Network in Philanthropy
in Detroit.  Not-for-profit self-scrutiny is further on display
in the latest publications from the foundation world.  See, for
example, Gerald Freund's new book <I>Narcissism and Philanthropy
</I>which chastises foundations for their insularity and urges
them to recognize and support talent [see review by Robert Huberty
on page 7]. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> In the methods they are adopting to confront what
they see as a threat to their legitimacy, the foundation aristocracy
is repeating the mistakes of group-think which helped create the
initial pattern of problems they confront and that have generated
so much anxiety.  Indeed, their choice of guru, former Federal
Trade Commission Chairman Michael Pertschuk, insures the continuation
of what Heather MacDonald characterized as a pattern of &quot;Destructive
Philanthropy&quot; in a recent <I>Wall Street Journal </I>article.
 Pertschuk, who now heads a Washington organization called the
&quot;Advocacy Institute,&quot; encourages nonprofit support for
liberal political advocacy _ precisely the type of activity drawing
the attention and ire of the Republican majority in Congress.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></I>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>THE GODFATHER  OF ADVOCACY<BR>
</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Michael Pertschuk is not as well known as Ralph Nader
and he has less public visibility than Common Cause founder John
Gardner or Fred Wertheimer, the group's campaign finance lobbyist.
 But wherever an observer inquires into foundation and nonprofit
advocacy of government social welfare programs Pertschuk's imprint
is today visible.  More than any of the others, Pertschuk _ who
earns a $71,000 annual salary from the Advocacy Institute _ represents
the view that the purpose of philanthropy is to use private dollars
to leverage tax revenues for left-of-center causes. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Pertschuk has been called &quot;the Grover Norquist
of the Left&quot; by those familiar with his activities.  He helped
draft the strategy which defeated Robert Bork's nomination to
the Supreme Court, and he has been a consultant to the American
Cancer Society in its fight against the tobacco industry _ work
he began over thirty years ago as the coordinator of the Surgeon
General's first conference on Smoking and Health. More recently,
he assisted ABC News producer  Deborah Leff become president of
the Joyce Foundation  [see vol.1 no.6, &quot;How does the Joyce
Foundation deal with dissent? Squash  it!&quot;].<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> A  prep school graduate who attended both Yale University
_ as an English major, Pertschuk studied with <I>All the King's
Men</I> novelist Robert Penn Warren _ and Yale Law School.  Coming
to Washington in the Kennedy administration, Pertschuk served
for about a decade as chief of staff to Senator Warren Magnuson
(D-WA), chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee.  Magnuson
was in his dotage near the end, and Pertschuk's power and influence
over legislation before the Committee grew so great that he gained
the reputation of being &quot;the 101st Senator&quot; and enjoyed
the social clout that accompanies power in Washington.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Pertschuk currently lives in the fashionable Northwest
section of the city and his children attended the Georgetown Day
School, an expensive academically prominent private school in
the Capital, alongside spawn of the Graham family, owners of <I>The
Washington Post</I>.  Pertschuk was named chairman of the Federal
Trade Commission in the Carter Administration.  In his ironically-titled
memoir <I>Giant Killers</I> (Norton, 1986), he boasts of enjoying
lunch at the pricey Four Seasons restaurant on the expense account
of a founding member of Washington's exclusive Congressional Country
Club.  His plutocratic habits extend to a taste for fine cigars,
which he smokes discreetly, inasmuch as he is professionally committed
to the anti-tobacco lobby's attempt to ban smoking in public.
 Pertschuk told <I>Foundation Watch </I>that he now only smokes
on hikes far from civilization and &quot;at my daughter's wedding.&quot;
 (James Miller, the FTC chairman during the Reagan administration
and Pertschuk's successor, recalls, &quot;When in fact he smoked
cigars, he made a point of not smoking in public, or when the
TV cameras were around.  But he smoked cigars.  I smoke cigars,
too.&quot;)  As a consultant to the American Cancer Society, Pertschuk
co-ordinates global anti-smoking programs.  Invited to acknowledge
this small personal weakness, Pertschuk retorts that his opposition
is to large corporations that profit from harmful products, not
to smoking<I> per se</I>.  By such ideological logic are Cuban
cigars preferable to Marlboro cigarettes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> When he was chairman of the Federal Trade Commission
Pertschuk tried to ban television advertising to children, a move
that earned him the sobriquet &quot;the national nanny&quot; in
a critical <I>Washington Post </I>editorial. Pertschuk dismisses
the <I>Post</I>'s criticism, claiming that the paper's opposition
was motivated not by its editorial  commitment to free speech
but by the corporate self-interest of its parent company, the
owner of television stations.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> This instinctual opposition to corporations is inherent
in Pertschuk's mind-set.  He searches for the vicious corporate
self-interest in every private sector act while attributing a
noble public interest to every nonprofit sector act.  Indeed,
this is the assumption that underlies Pertschuk's Advocacy Institute.
 Co-chaired by veteran Common Cause lobbyists David Cohen and
Kathleen D. Sheeky _ and supported by the Ford Foundation, the
Joyce Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, the Nathan Cummings
Foundation, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the New York Community
Trust, the Tides Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
and the Florence and John Schumann Foundation (headed by Bill
Moyers's son, John) _ the Advocacy Institute spends some $2 million
annually running workshops, training sessions, and networking
activities for foundations and &quot;community&quot; organizations.
 Its mission statement declares its political objective, &quot;strengthening
the capacity of social and economic justice advocates to influence
and change public policy.&quot;  Despite decades of misguided
social spending, Pertschuk remains blind to the failures of federal
government programs and foundation support for nonprofits who
promote it.  When asked about the Great Society's ignominious
War On Poverty, he only responds that its initiatives &quot;were
not fully funded.&quot;  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> One might go so far as to say that the Advocacy
Institute's sources of funding suggest a self-interested reason
why Pertschuk won't publicly criticize his patrons and the failure
of their initiatives, to use his own method of analysis.  Pertschuk
knows how the bread of advocacy is buttered.  The Institute's
1995 annual report states &quot;the largest grants to the Institute
come from private foundations.&quot;  If the priority of foundation
giving were direct provision of services rather than advocacy,
the first casualty would be the Advocacy Institute.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Pertschuk's uncritical attitude toward the mandarins
of philanthropy was manifested at the three-day meeting of the
Communications Network in Philanthropy in Detroit on October 9-11.
 He was there to inform public relations staffers from the foundation
sector about the &quot;threats&quot; to their activities and to
recommend how they could be overcome.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>A GATHERING OF  GIANTS<BR>
</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> By words the mind is excited and  the spirit elated,&quot;
read the quote from Aristophanes gracing the cover of the program
packet for the 1996 Communications Network in Philanthropy Fall
Conference.  Hosted by the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation of
Flint, Michigan, the conference was held at the Atheneum Hotel
in Detroit's Greektown.  This was the venue for the annual gathering
of public relations officers who belong to the &quot;affinity
group&quot; of the Council on Foundations, and those in attendance
represented the giants of philanthropy. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Among those present were emissaries of the biggest
of the big foundations: America's largest, the $7.5 billion Ford
Foundation, was represented by vice-president Robert Curvin. 
Karen E. Lake, director of communications, carried the flag for
the $6 billion W.K. Kellogg Foundation.  Victoria D. Weisfeld
was there; she is outgoing president of the Communications Network
in Philanthropy and Senior Communications Officer of the $4 billion
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  And so was Raymond C. Boyer,
director of communications for the $3 billion John D. and Catherine
T. MacArthur Foundation.  <I> </I></FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The meeting participants found themselves in a focus
group led by Richard Harwood, whose private consulting company
has been a major beneficiary of so-called &quot;public journalism
grants from the Pew and Kettering foundation. In another event
they heard  from Hedrick Smith, the former <I>New York Times </I>Moscow
correspondent -- who was pinch-hitting for <I>U.S. News and World
Report </I>editor James Fallows, a last minute cancellation. Smith's
anti-Republican PBS election special &quot;The People and  the
Power Game&quot; had received significant support from the funders
represented in Detroit (the event hosts, the Charles Stewart Mott
Foundation, had given his show a quarter of a million dollars).
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  <I>Foundation Watch</I> was there as well, as an
invited speaker at a closing-day panel called &quot;Foundations
Under Scrutiny.&quot;  This panel allowed the foundation communication
chiefs to hear themselves attacked from Left and Right.  The other
speakers on the panel included the Hudson Institute's Michael
Horowitz, who, as a Reagan Administration official at the Office
of Management and Budget, tried some fifteen years ago to end
federal funding of advocacy groups, and Robert Bothwell, director
of the liberal National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy.
 The conservative criticisms were strong, with Horowitz accusing
foundation officers of being &quot;little better than thieves&quot;
who worsened the plight of the poor by diverting resources from
the needy to themselves.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  The <I>Foundation Watch</I> presentation, subdued
by comparison, asked those assembled to consider the advantages
of a more even-handed approach to funding controversial public
issues.  Bothwell, who had recently received a $30,000 foundation
grant to study conservative foundation activity, singled out the
Pew Charitable Trusts for special criticism, arguing that they
so micromanaged their grant projects that independent thought
became almost impossible.   <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> It is doubtful, however, whether any of these criticisms
were taken to heart.  <I>Foundation Watch</I> was privileged to
observe two days of networking, seminars, and fellowship.  Perhaps
as befits a convention of public relations spinmeisters, the purpose
of their meetings was not to change foundation behavior but to
change the perception of foundation behavior.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> There was one critical session at which we were
not present.  However, materials concerning the session are available,
and they offer perhaps the most significant evidence of the failure
of the foundation sector to understand that more is at stake than
public relations imagery and perceptions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>PERTSCHUK'S P.R. MENU </FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On the first day of the Detroit conference, Wednesday,
October 9, the Communications Network in Philanthropy held its
business meeting and election of officers.  This was followed
by a motor coach excursion to the Detroit Zoological Institute
where the participants enjoyed a cash bar social hour, followed
by dinner and a keynote address by Michael Pertschuk.  A printed
outline of his talk, &quot;A Wake-Up Call: It's Your Turn,&quot;
discloses that he discussed neither tobacco nor children's advertising.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Foundation Watch </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>was not
present for the give-and-take.  But the outline, which is entitled
<I>A Menu of Possible Responses to Meeting the Growing Challenges
to Foundation Legitimacy</I>, invites foundations to confront
their critics aggressively with a battery of opposition research
and public relations initiatives.  Nowhere in the document does
Pertschuk suggest that the giants of philanthropy take criticism
seriously and reform their giving.  Instead, his analysis reassures
foundations that it is the critics who are to blame.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Section one, bearing the title &quot;'Opposition'
Research: define the problem,&quot; defines the problem in a curiously
self-serving way.  It identifies foundations as victims.  Point
&quot;a&quot;: <I> &quot;Keep track: who is thinking about doing
what to foundations, and when?  Organize an on-line, private information
exchange among foundation communications officers.&quot; </I>underscores
a defensiveness toward public discussion that one would not expect
of foundations that want to improve communications.  Rather than
call for increased openness, public scrutiny and accountability,
the promise made by Dorothy Ridings, the new Council on Foundations
president, Pertschuk's first recommendation is for a proprietary
exchange of privileged information.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Pertschuk's point &quot;b&quot; reframes an important
debate over policy into a strategy to capture political rhetoric:
<I> &quot;Do or fund research on 'defunding the left' initiatives
and rhetoric to identify percursory moves for future attacks on
foundation.  Analyze the rhetoric of the Christian Right, the
populist right, Istook, Simpson, et. al.; George Mason University,
the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation.&quot; </I> Rather
than answer conservative critics seriously on the merits of their
claims, Pertschuck  instead advocates &quot;deconstructing&quot;
their arguments. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Point &quot;c&quot; reiterates the strategy of out-talking
your critics:  <I>&quot;Develop likely scenarios for future attacks
on foundations, including rhetorical devices that demonize foundations.&quot;
 <BR>
</I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Finally, point &quot;d&quot; formalizes public relations
&quot;spin&quot;:<I>  &quot;Commission polls and focus groups
designed to elicit knowledge, feelings and responsive chords so
as to gauge the success of attacks on foundations and to provide
guidance for affirmative responses.&quot;</I>  With the right
focus groups, nothing needs to change. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Building on the questionable premises of these appetizers,
the Pertschuk menu's second course is &quot;Strategic Planning:
define the goals.&quot;  The goal is to defend against change.
 Point &quot;a&quot; calls upon foundations to<I> &quot;build
broad public recognition and support, through public education,
for the role of foundations in society_free of government controls?&quot;</I>
 Of course, foundations are creatures of government control, specifically
the I.R.S. and the states that charter foundation activities.
 Service to the public interest is what asset-rich foundations
are supposed to provide in exchange for their tax-exemption .
 It is odd that Pertschuk, who would increase government control
over other parts of society, downplays the legal restrictions
currently placed on foundations. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Point &quot;b&quot;: attacks what to this observer
is the reality of the Foundation sector and again urges new strategies
focused on changing perceptions:<I>  &quot;To zero in on changing
public perceptions of national foundations as elitist, unaccountable,
wasteful, illegitimate, too left, too liberal, too big.&quot;
<BR>
</I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Pertschuk's point &quot;c&quot; flatters his patrons:<I>
&quot;To build support for foundations as an integral part of
the 'independent sector' and, specifically, as public policy watchdogs
identifying private sector failures and government corruption,
inefficiency, overreaching? (The foundation as the latter day
equivalent of the old testament prophets?).&quot;  </I>When a
corporation hires a management consultant, it looks for internal
problems before it blames external conditions.  But Pertschuk's
menu of responses reverses the order.  Public criticism of foundations
is occurring not because the public fails to see the good that
foundations do, but because it disapproves of what it sees. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The menu's third section, &quot;Smorgasboard of
possible initiatives,&quot; repeats the effort to manage criticism
of the grantmaking activities of foundations with public relations
stunts. One point, however might especially interest readers of
this publication:<I>  &quot;Support an independent, investigative
'Foundation Watch' Watch.&quot;</I>  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> This particular invitation to dig up dirt on foundation
critics -- specifically this periodical -- highlights the cowardice
and disingenuousness of the foundation sector in the face of criticism.
Rather than engage in civil debate over contested issues based
on facts, figures, and the historical record,  the advocates of
&quot;advocacy&quot;  prefer to sling mud at those raising questions.

<FONT SIZE=2>  This editor told Pertschuk in an interview that
he could find out all he needs to know about <I>Foundation Watch</I>
by purchasing a subscription and reading the publication.  But
clandestine activity is a constant temptation for those with vested
interests in maintaining the <I>status quo</I>.  When invited
to contribute an article to Capital Research Center on his vision
for philanthropy, Pertschuk replied, &quot;I don't have a particular
vision for philanthropy.&quot;  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Instead, Pertschuk suggests public relations ploys:
 editorial board visits, the production of videos, sponsoring
PBS and NPR programs, funding public relations campaigns through
Independent Sector, and &quot;strategic communications training&quot;
_ not coincidentally a specialty of the Advocacy Institute _ for
foundation leaders, staff, selected grantees, and &quot;'esteemed'
non-foundation leaders as spokespersons.&quot;  All are methods
which are designed to make concrete criticisms of foundations
go away, rather than receive the attention they deserve.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>THE FISHBOWL'S INNER CIRCLE<BR>
</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> One needed only to wait one month to see Michael
Pertschuk's recommendations turned into action items.  The National
Symposium on Foundations and the Public Sector held in Washington
on November 14 and 15 bore all the hallmarks of the Pertschuk
influence.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Participants at the first day's session of the Symposium
seemed to be reading from Pertschuk's script. All the &quot;esteemed&quot;
foundation and non-foundation leaders were gathered together by
the Council on Foundations and by a number of non-profit groups.
 There were dozens of participants at the opening ceremonies.
 But a curious segregation occurred shortly afterwards.  On the
morning of the first day, participants were arranged into an &quot;inner
circle&quot; and an outer circle in what conference organizers
called &quot;the fishbowl.&quot;  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The fishbowl was the central feature in a two-day
exercise in consensus formation that might remind filmgoers of
a scene in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate.&quot;  It was fascinating
to an outside observer.  For in their rush to confront their critics,
the foundations justified the critics' strongest claims.  The
foundations were engaging in a public demonstration of &quot;group-think&quot;
as shallow and embarrassing as it was doomed to failure.  And
the failures of the group dynamics on display in the fishbowl
reflected the failures of a philanthropy enamoured of faddish
trends in media relations and public opinion formation that were
on display in Detroit and Washington.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> In the &quot;fishbowl&quot; were gathered the &quot;inner
circle&quot; _ one might call them the usual suspects _ who represented
the central committee of the liberal philanthropic establishment.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Notably absent were representatives of any conservative
foundation or organization, although at least two representatives
of the Philanthropy Roundtable -- Whitney Ball and John Walters
-- were in the room.  The conservatives later were permitted to
lead small group sessions.  But the main event was reserved for
liberals.  All others were were relegated to the &quot;outer circle.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Moderator Judy K. Chynoweth, executive director
of the Foundation Consortium for School-Linked Services, announced
that she would &quot;play Oprah.&quot;  Her language was thick
with the phrases familiar to foundation types _ she once actually
did say, &quot;Thank you for sharing.&quot;  Chynoweth would call
on individuals from the &quot;outer circle&quot; to sit briefly
in an &quot;inner circle&quot; guest chair to ask a  question
_ a procedure used to insure that the &quot;inner circle&quot;
remained secure.  Not only was she insensible to the elitism of
the enterprise, but in technocratic phrases she charged the participants
 to recognize that the session was &quot;a production meeting,&quot;
and that the participants should see themselves as &quot;assembly
line workers&quot; who were manufacturing a &quot;learning tool&quot;
in a &quot;carefully crafted process&quot; involving the &quot;construction
of small groups.&quot;  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Occupants of the inner circle dutifully nodded,
then launched into tense and peculiar disquisitions on the dangers
foundations faced from a Republican Congress.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The first speaker, Joel Orosz, read aloud from a
1952 <I>American Legion Magazine</I> article describing foundations
as composed of &quot;outright communists...fellow travellers...</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>one worlders&quot; and what he called &quot; my personal
favorite: well-meaning dupes.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  That comment was greeted by condescending laughter
as Orosz outlined the failure of Congress' 1954 Reece Committee
investigations as well as the 1969 Wright Patman investigations,
which he characterized as &quot;relatively benign&quot; compared
to today's criticisms. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Waving Heather MacDonald's <I>Wall Street Journal</I>
article in the air, Orosz declared that the present situation
was &quot;more dangerous&quot; than ever, and that foundations
faced a political climate unseen since the days of Andrew Jackson.
 Jacksonian democracy, he said, regarded foundations as closed
corporations, and the danger was that foundation opponents like
those of the nineteenth century Anti-Masonic party were mobilizing
against the assembled foundations and eyeing their tax exemptions.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Peter Edelman, whose judicial nomination was left
twisting in the wind by the Clinton Administration, praised conservative
foundations.  He announced that he was &quot;grateful for Scaife,
Mellon, Olin, and Bradley, the people on the conservative side
who are unabashed in their willingness to spend money on advocacy
and public policy.&quot;  The problem, he said, was that the liberal
side was letting conservative efforts go &quot;unanswered.&quot;
 To correct this &quot;imbalance&quot; was the task before philanthropy.
 Ironically, conservative foundations would assist this task because,
he said, they would be able &quot;to resist changes and to protect
the ability to advocate.&quot;  Whether Edelman was pursuing some
private joke or on to something new was unclear to this reporter.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Only Robert Wood Johnson Foundation vice-president
Paul Jellinek  said something of genuine insight during the seemingly
endless round-robin, perhaps because of  his organization's participation
in the Clinton administration's ill-fated health care plan.  He
observed that the nonprofit sector got &quot;so wrapped up in
fighting Istook that we missed the big policy debate&quot; over
welfare.  Jellinek suggested that next time foundations &quot;keep
at least one eye open&quot; for issues other than their own institutional
self-interest. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The fishbowl session ended.  Much like the family
goldfish, life eventually drained out of the panelists who tired
of the discussion.  They moved on to small group discussions which
were intended to raise &quot;questions&quot; for the larger group.
 (Social science research has determined that small groups are
most conducive to reinforcing shared opinions, which is called
&quot;consensus formation.&quot;) <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The activities of the small groups were obviously
a pretext for political networking, as was apparent when the &quot;questions&quot;
were posted on the wall in the hotel ballroom.  Written in magic
marker on giant sheets of paper held up by masking tape, each
repeated the banalities of &quot;community&quot; and &quot;public
interest,&quot; &quot;accountability&quot; and &quot;the role
of the press.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> What was the meeting really about?  (&quot;Who am
I?  Why am I here?&quot;)  Sara Melendez, president of Independent
Sector, offered some hint in remarks at the first and final public
discussions of the conference.  She warned the assembled group
that Independent Sector would be investigated in the next session
of Congress by Rep. Nancy Johnson's (R-CT) House oversight committee
as &quot;payback&quot; for its advocacy efforts to defeat the
Istook amendment.  Melendez asked for their support in the coming
months. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> After cutting through all the New Age psychobabble,
here was what the National Symposium was about: creating a network
to defend Independent Sector and derail congressional oversight.
 Rally the troops, issue marching orders, and, no doubt, follow
up with memoranda and private communications which will not be
provided to <I>Foundation Watch</I>.</FONT>

<I><B>Narcissism and Philanthropy</B></I></FONT></B>
<P>
by Robert Huberty<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>DEFENDING THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Gerald Freund, <I>Narcissism and Philanthropy: Ideas
and Talent Denied</I> (Viking, 1996) 158 pages. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Modern liberals deny that one can know the true
and good.  But this ignorance does not stop them from wanting
to win, nor does it interfere with their desire to reward the
success of those who share their convictions, or lack thereof.
 Washington abounds with such people, who seek to dazzle through
brilliance.  The best and the brightest, as they once were called,
believe they deserve rewards and honors, and it is the thesis
of this book that they are not getting what they deserve.  Gerald
Freund, an administrator and official active in foundation affairs
for over forty years, is the former director of the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation &quot;genius&quot; awards program.
 In <I>Narcissism and Philanthropy</I> he mourns the failure of
other foundations to appreciate the importance of grace and favors
for golden boys.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Writing for foundation insiders, Freund argues that
foundation grants are used most productively when they support
&quot;exceptional&quot; individuals of &quot;extraordinary&quot;
promise.  Increasingly, however, foundations are caught between
the forces of left and right.  Multiculturalists pounce on grants
for individual excellence to find evidence of racism and elitism,
while conservative populists abhor cutting-edge creativity.  Freund
worries that foundation officers are turning inward: they have
become sensitive to appearances and have grown self-assertive
and self-regarding (hence the book's peculiar title).  Freund
contends that the networks of talent scouts to which foundations
once turned for advice are deteriorating.  Foundation program
officers don't consult with outside experts as they once did.
 They don't seek out bright minds to explore ideas and create
programs to reward risk-takers.  Instead, they carefully screen
grant applicants through complex criteria and narrowly define
projects to fulfill specific goals.  Self-conscious of their own
professional standing (and defensive about it), foundations impose
limiting conditions on their dispensations.  The arrogance of
the insecure purseholder is making a comeback.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Freund is a former Rockefeller Foundation program
officer who handled grants to individuals and he has fond memories
of the days when program officers dispensed them freely and easily.
 He extols the example of John D. Rockefeller and his family,
who recruited &quot;the best brains they could attract to investigate
competing claims on their philanthropies.&quot;  He contrasts
Rockefeller to the narcissist Andrew Carnegie who trusted only
his own philanthropic judgment.  Freund has no sympathy for &quot;donor
intent,&quot; the notion that donors should insure that their
intentions are precise and fully observed when they establish
foundations.  He argues instead that foundations misuse their
power, not when they violate donors' intentions, but when they
are unresponsive to grant recipients' needs.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> And who are the needy?  Certainly not the recipients
of charity.  Freund is careful to distinguish philanthropy from
charity, and, one suspects, he would make the latter a handmaiden
to the welfare state.  No: philanthropy's task is to identify
the &quot;imaginative minority&quot; and &quot;superior talents&quot;
who are &quot;our most important resource.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Trapped in a New Frontier time-warp, Freund says
foundations once honored that obligation to find and help the
very best.  He commends the Rockefeller Foundation:  During the
dark days of the 1950s Dean Rusk, its president and a future Secretary
of State, supported the recruitment of talent to specialize in
international legal theory, which international legal theorists
warned was in short supply.  Then there was the Ford Foundation
under president McGeorge Bundy, President Kennedy's former National
Security Council advisor:  In 1968 Ford braved controversy by
giving individual grants to Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign
staff after the Senator was assassinated, thereby providing Peter
Edelman and others with much-needed &quot;turn-around time.&quot;
 And the Carnegie Corporation under president John Gardner (HEW
secretary to LBJ) rescued overworked college presidents of exceptional
talent by funding year-long sabbaticals, enabling them to recharge
their batteries.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Most of <I>Narcissism and Philanthropy </I>consists
of foggy tips on ways that foundations can continue to seek out
&quot;excellence&quot; and shepherd &quot;the creative spirit.&quot;
 Worthwhile grants to individuals are possible, says Freund, when
foundations pick grant selection committees whose members &quot;have
sufficient knowledge to make rigorous judgments, but one wants
them also to be generous and imaginative, open-minded, seasoned
and perspicacious.&quot;  Foundations should employ mature and
knowledgeable program officers who can offer their grantees &quot;nurturing
support and an ongoing relationship.&quot;  Foundation professionals
should be tactful, too:  &quot;Helpful when called upon but not
intrusive or prying; they do not make grantees feel they need
to express inordinate or inappropriate gratitude.&quot;   <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> In a book notably lacking in clarity or humor, the
ten pages Freund devotes to the origins of the MacArthur Foundation
&quot;genius&quot; awards provides some relief.  In spring 1979
the Foundation hired Freund, then a Hunter College dean, to assemble
assorted luminaries to brainstorm the purpose of the awards and
consider how to pick their winners.  The deliberations recounted
here reveal how silly bright people can be.  Jonas Salk &quot;urged
MacArthur to create a program that would enable people to train
in a discipline other than one they were in and also to create
an ambience that would encourage people to change fields.&quot;
 Unnamed others worried that interviews and written applications
might give articulate candidates an unfair advantage.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Freund says nothing about the MacArthur awards'
notorious reliance on race, gender and ethnicity, and he is silent
about when and why he left MacArthur's employ as the awards' program
director.  But from other remarks it is clear that he is dismayed
by foundations' use of multicultural criteria and worried that
conservatives will attack them for it.  In an aside, he consoles
himself that a conservative Congress may hesitate to encroach
on foundation autonomy because it will not want to interfere with
the bold work of conservative foundations like Bradley and Olin.
 They, apparently, are the final defense of Camelot.<BR>

<title>Michael Lind's Ad Hominem Attack On Conservative Foundations</title>

<center><h2>Michael Lind's Ad Hominem Attack On Conservative Foundations</h2></center>
<blockquote>
<center><h4>by Robert Huberty</h4></center>
<P>
<I>Up From Conservatism: Why the Right Is Wrong for America <I>
by Michael Lind (The Free Press, 1996, 295 pages, $23).
<p><br>
Michael Lind's hate letter to the conservative movement is a peculiar
production. It's a complex and sour brew of personal memoir and social
history, public policy analysis and political punditry. The author
deliberately aims to devalue
every intellectual and moral claim of Reagan-Gingrich conservatism.^M
 He is intent on revealing as counterfeit an inside-the-Beltway^M
Washington conservative establishment and the grantmaking foundations^M
that fund it.  Part expose and part bitter reflection, Lind proclaims^M
himself a one-time insider who has seen the belly of the beast.
<P>
Its title echoing William F. Buckley,^M
Jr.'s <I>Up From Liberalism</I>, Lind's book unfolds as an autobiographical^M
complaint.  As a young friend of Buckley's, Lind yearned to imitate^M
his mentor's feat of expelling someone from the conservative movement.^M
 But while Buckley won applause for criticizing Ayn Rand and the^M
John Birch Society, conservatives seemed not to care about Lind's^M
whistleblowing essays on what Pat Robertson believed about the^M
history of central banking, the Rothschilds and Karl Marx.  Conservatism^M
endent^Mement of combative writers and scholars had given way^M
to conservatism as a political movement, and theoretical and theological^M
differences among allies were downplayed for the sake of immediate^M
common ends in public policy.  The young writer was appalled.
<P>
Lind asserts that grantmaking foundations^M
have played the key role in orchestrating this development in^M
conservative opinion.  Through the power of the purse, he credits^M
them with an extraordinary capacity to advance careers, inhibit^M
dissent and shape public policies.  Like other conspiracy theorists^M
on the left and right, Lind sees interlocking directorates of^M
power in which orders are issued, tasks assigned, and projects^M
coordinated among favored writers and think-tanks.  [See the September^M
1996 issue of the radical <I>Z Magazine</I> which makes Capital^M
Research Center the center of a &quot;Meese/Simon axis.&quot;]^M
 Lind claims that conservative magazines and think-tanks are dep
on five conservative foundations: the John M. Olin Foundation,^M
Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust/Pew^M
Charitable Trusts, Smith-Richardson Foundation, and Sarah Scaife^M
Foundation.  But Pew has not been on anyone's list of conservative^M
funders in recent years while the others pursue more diverse and^M
fluctuating interests than he admits.
<P>
Lind construes the small number of^M
conservative grantmakers as evidence of a powerful conspiracy:^M
plutocratic pseudo-populists at work.  Of course, it's really^M
evidence of conservatism's weakness in the field of institutional^M
grantmaking and among foundation professionals.  Conservatives^M
are fortunate to have developed support from individual and foundation^M
donors.  And because they have lacked academic contacts, major^M
publishing outlets, and access to the national news media and^M
subsidized public broadcasting, conservatives have been entrepreneurial^M
in establishing their own think-tanks, newsletters and magazines,^M
creating direct mail and talk radio to get around the big media,^M
and securing footholds on the op-ed pages of major newspapers^M
through the excellence of their writing.  Lind mistakes initiative^M
for intrigue.  The liberal bias in major corporate giving to nonprofit^M
advocacy groups should be enough to undermine the claim that conservatives^M
are pampered mouthpieces of a corporate elite.
<P>
For someone with his intellectual ambitions,^M
Lind's writing can be incredibly snide and callow.  An advocate^M
of restricting legal immigration and an opponent of NAFTA, Lind^M
labels both Clinton Democrats and conservative Republicans as^M
members of the &quot;overclass.&quot;  He says both allow foreign^M
labor to dispossess white working class Americans and they do^M
it to justify their hired help:  &quot;Here, then, is a simple^M
test of overclass status.  Americans who do not have advanced^M
degrees and cannot afford maids or nannies are middle class; Americans^M
who have advanced degrees and can afford maids or nannies are^M
overclass.  It's as simple as that.&quot;  Lind's own opinions^M
are tinged with a nativist resentment and he insinuates that the^M
conservative movement is somehow alien.  He finds it peculiar^M
that so many conservative intellectuals have been Jews, Catholics^M
or foreign-born, and he disparages the major role &quot;foreigners^M
and immigrants&quot; like Rupert Murdoch play in funding journalists^M
of the right.
<P>
Because he covers so much political^M
and historical ground, <I>Up From Conservatism</I> could have^M
been an interesting book to argue with.  Lind believes conservatism^M
grew strong in the 80s because the culturally radical left destroyed^M
liberalism in the 60s and 70s.  An advocate of what he variously^M
calls &quot;national liberalism&quot; and &quot;neo-paleo-liberalism,&quot;^M
Lind argues that the modern Republican party is radical, not conservative,^M
and that its anti-tax, anti-regulation policies derive from a^M
&quot;Jefferson-Jackson populist liberalism.&quot;   Lind also^M
attacks the obsessive identity politics of the multi-culturalist^M
Left, and he faults New Democrats for promoting free trade and^M
entitlement reform instead of cultivating the FDR/LBJ legacy of^M
labor unions, social insurance and income redistribution, which^M
are the core of his own welfarist politics.  It is a mystery,^M
however, why this former Heritage Foundation fellow  should think^M
conservatives betrayed him by failing to honor these opinions.^M
 That sense of personal betrayal warps everything he has to say^M
about conservatism, and it gives his book its irate and even demented^M
tone.
<P>
Michael Lind is now a staff writer^M
at <I>The New Yorker</I> (edited by the British-born Tina Brown).^M
 HarperCollins (owned by Rupert Murdoch) has just published his^M
first novel, <I>Powertown</I>, a  depiction of greedy, conniving,^M
degraded residents of Washington, D.C.  which helps explain why^M
he might have written <I>Up From Conservatism. </I>The first reviews^M
of the novel should help Lind decide whether his new colleagues^M
in the New York literary world are more fair-minded and generous^M
than the conservatives he thinks let him down.<BR>^M

<title>Hocking the Halo:  Are America's Charities for Sale?</title>
</head>

<center><h2>Hocking the Halo:  Are America's Charities for Sale?</h2></center>
<blockquote>
<center><h4>by Thomas DiLorenzo<BR>
(As seen in The Washington Times on August 17, 1996)
</h4></center>
<P>
<DD>	Small business is raising hell as it discovers that some of America's largest nonprofit charities unfairly earn millions of dollars by "hocking their halos."<BR>
<DD>	The American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Lung Association, Arthritis Foundation and others are entering the business world and setting up operations that sell everything from vacation packages to mutual funds.  
Small businesses complain they can't match the deals offered by their tax-exempt business rivals.  They say such practices are "unfair competition."  Some businesses even accuse charities of "ripping off" their products and customers and trading on the charity's good reputation.<BR>
<DD>	A recent news story described how small businesses that sell turbans, hats, scarves and prostheses to female cancer patients have attacked the American Cancer Society (ACS) for distributing a new, mail-order catalogue peddling the same products they sell for a living.  The catalogue sales undercut small business in two ways:  ACS's tax-exempt status allows it to offer the products at a lower price, and its charitable status gives the products an perceived seal of approval.  The ACS is "using its vast reservoir of goodwill and trust to sell products," complains Peggy Childs, proprietor of Designs for Comfort, a Chicago business that is forced to compete with ACS products.<BR>
<DD>	The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) is the most notorious example of a non-profit organization that uses its good name to sell hundreds of millions of dollars of products annually.  AARP sells insurance policies, mutual funds, mail-order pharmaceuticals, auto rental s, auto club memberships, Visa and Mastercard credit cards, and hotel discount packages.  Companies like Scudder Financial Services, Prudential Insurance, American Express, New York Life, JTT Hartford, Amoco, and Bank One provide the products and services.  Then they pay AARP a percentage of their sales in return for the use of the charity's name and reputation.<BR>
<DD>	AARP pays taxes on ad revenue from its Modern Maturity magazine and on income from its money market funds and credit cards.  But its pharmacy, auto club and insurance profits are not taxed, prompting the charges of  "unfair competition."  Business has a good point:  Why should AARP be exempt from taxes when virtually identical companies not affiliated with the non-profit giant must pay taxes to provide the same services?  <BR>
<DD>	Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) aptly summarized this conflict at a 1995 Senate hearing.  It is as if "U.S. Steel decided to rename itself the 'American Association of Steel Enthusiasts,' offered some discounts and rebates to millions of Americans in exchange for a strictly nominal contribution, and then used that incidental association to gain tax-exempt status."<BR>
<DD>	There is evidence, moreover, that AARP members relying on the group's good reputation are buying inferior products. For instance:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>	Last year, Money magazine evaluated AARP's businesses and concluded that of AARP's ten types of insurance, only its supplemental Medicare insurance deserved high marks; the rest were rated "decent to dreadful."  
<LI>	In 1994, 25 mutual funds did better than AARP's best performer, its Growth and Income fund.
<LI>	And in 1983, 500 San Diego AARP members purchased cellular phones for $209 each from a firm that promised to pay AARP $5 for each phone sold to a member.  But the company went bankrupt, the members did not receive their phones or a refund, and AARP -- with $358 million in revenues that year -- refused to reimburse them, saying it "couldn't afford" the cost.<P>
<BR>
<DD>	Other charities are jumping on the commercial bandwagon.  The American Heart Association sold its "Heart Check Seal of Approval" for $550,000 to the Florida citrus industry.  (Earlier, it abandoned its "HeartGuide Seal" program after the FDA warned the public that some of its claims might be "illegal" and "unproven.")  The American Lung Association endorses home carbon monoxide testing kits for a fee.  The Arthritis Foundation has endorsed Johnson and Johnson products in return for $1 million in annual donations.  And the Skin Cancer Foundation's "Seal of Recommendation" is for sale for $100,000 per year.<BR>
<DD>	The commercialization of non-profit activities is a disturbing trend, because it squanders the organization's most valuable asset, the public's trust.  In the long run, the nonprofit sector is jeopardized.  The mere perception that a charity is hocking its halo -- its good name -- for profit will scare donors away.  They won't contribute to a charity that prefers to sell its services instead.

Traditionally, newspapers have shied away from developing close relationships with the foundation world. Because newspapers and television have long ago taken  the position that outside money is tainted, they'd sooner turn to advertisers for revenues -- even advertisers they don't like -- than apply for a grant.The code of ethics of Sigma Delta Chi (the journalists' professional organization) prohibits accepting "any thing of value" in exchange for covering a story. But lately things have changed. On June 20, 1996 the Pew Charitable Trusts announced grants of  $4.3 million over the next three years to the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington, D.C. as one component of an enterprise called "Renewing Our Democratic Heart."
Pew is composed of  seven named charitable trusts with different missions, established from 1948 to 1979. One hundred fifteen employees give out $180 million each year, making Pew the nation's third largest foundation. Pew is currently footing the bill for 34 media projects nationwide as part of a movement known as civic journalism (the movement is more commonly called public or community journalism depending on which group is pushing it). Although the names are different, the purpose is the same. However, civic journalism  remains controversial among editors such as Howell Raines of the New York Times and Leonard Downie of the Washington Post chary about outsiders influencing their editorial decisions. Smaller papers seem to have fewer hesitations about taking Pew's money.
And so Pew, with no previous track record in journalism, has suddenly emerged as a major player in the news business. Foundation president Rebecca Rimel proudly declares that thanks to her multi-million dollar expenditure, civic journalism "is becoming the way to do business in many newsrooms across the country." This is happening, in large part, because Pew is paying newspapers, and radio and television stations to cover stories in the way it wants to see them covered.
Pew's $4.3 million commitment is only the most recent development in Pew's onging love affair with the media. Since fall 1993, the foundation has pledged at least $19.7 million to various media enterprises, $10.7 million of it to support civic journalism. In some cases, Pew provides lump sums to newspapers and broadcast outlets so they can conduct opinion polls and convene focus groups. Pew pays newspapers to send reporters out of town and even to rent apartments for reporters to live in selected neighborhoods. The overarching goal of these activities is to use the "extradordinary power" of the media to stimulate the public "to participate in community life," as Rimel puts it. "Civic journalism is one way to engage people in seeking solutions to their local problems."

<h3>THE PEW MEDIA MONOPOLY</h3>
<p>
The Philadelphia-based Pew 
		Charitable Trusts established a 
		Washington, D.C. beachhead for its Pew Center for Civic Journalism in September 1993. The Center's staff of three is run by Walter Cronkite's former CBS News producer, Edward Fouhy. The Center distributes money to news organizations, holds seminars around the country and spreads the gospel of civic journalism to newsrooms across the land [see grants list box on page 4]. Last year, Pew gave Ed Fouhy's group an additional $300,000 over three years to "raise the visibility and stature of civic journalism through an awards and symposium program."
	This spring,  the Pew Center for Civic Journalism awarded prizes of  $25,000 to three newspapers _ The Charlotte Observer, The Kansas City Star and The Argus Leader in South Dakota _ for: "Doing journalism in a manner calculated to re-engage people in the process of public life."  While significantly smaller than a MacArthur "genius" award, the  $25,000 sum is among the more lucrative in the field.
	And when The Times-Mirror Company announced last year it would be forced to shutter its well-respected  Center for the People and Press, Pew donated money to keep the Washington-based polling organization open for three more years, and asked that it be called the Pew Research Center.
 	Pew is bankrolling former Washington Post reporter Paul Taylor's efforts to the tune of $111,864 for a six-month consulting contract, which includes salary, travel expenses and setting up conferences, to convince television networks to give free air time to presidential candidates. Taylor teamed up with Fouhy's old partner, former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite. Together they have successfully convinced Rupert Murdoch's Fox Television network to provide one hour of free airtime this fall. However, while candidate Bob Dole has agreed to participate,  President Clinton has not yet accepted.
       	Both through its Washington Center and directly, the Pew Charitable Trusts have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Radio-Television News Directors Foundation for community journalism projects, to the Citizens Election Project and National Public Radio and to Soundprint Media Center for online civic journalism through the World Wide Web. Pew has provided $3.2 million over three years for the National Arts Journalism program at the University of Georgia, as well. And, as devotees of National Public Radio hear over and over, the Pew Charitable Trusts sponsor the radio network's reporting on culture, the environment and religion. 
	Once a relatively obscure charity, Pew is sending shoots and tendrils everywhere in the world of journalism. "You mean the Pew media monopoly," jokes John Dinges, NPR editorial director. "It's an interesting experiment by a foundation to get into the world of media with some definite ideas for innovation and change."

<a name="Rimel"></a>
<h3>THE RIMEL REVOLUTION</h3>
<p>
Why are the Pew Charitable Trusts so interested in this new and controversial civic journalism movement? The answer lies more with president Rebecca Rimel  than with the nine trustees who ultimately decide how to spend Pew's millions. Rimel, aged 45, is a former emergency room nurse and assistant professor of neurology at the University of Virginia, who has done much to change the direction of a foundation once known for its low profile and conservative leanings. 
	Rimel joined the Philadelphia-based Pew foundation in 1983 as manager of its health program and quickly rose as former Pew president Thomas Langfitt's protege (he is an eminent neurosurgeon) to become vice president, then president in July 1988.  Today she earns $318,213 a year. After an administrative shake-up in which nearly two-thirds of  Pew's permanent staff departed Rimel has concentrated Pew's giving in six major program areas:  culture, education, health and human services, religion, public policy _ and an interdisciplinary grab-bag including the Children's Television Workshop's production of Ghostwriter for PBS, the Center for Community Change's anti-poverty initiatives, the Global Action Plan for the Earth, Inc. and San Francisco's Tides Foundation for the Global Stewardship Initiative. Rimel favors working in partnerships with other foundations, something Pew rarely did before.
	The Pews were an old Philadelphia family whose fortunes derived from the Sun Oil Co. (now Sunoco). Joseph N. and Mary Anderson Pew had four children who set up seven separate trusts between 1948 and 1979 which are jointly administered as the Pew Charitable Trusts. Together they became a major charity, generously handing out money _ mostly to local  Philadelphia organizations which helped the neediest. They didn't call press conferences. The Pew style was to quietly, often anonymously, dole out their largess. Until 1987, there was no listing for the Pew Charitable Trusts in the Philadelphia telephone directory. This was due to a "a very deep religious conviction that one does not need recognition for their good deeds," says Rimel. 
	 It was J. Howard Pew who built the family business into a global enterprise. And he left the strongest imprint on the family trusts created in 1957 to further the free enterprise system. Under his direction, it supported such causes as open markets, lower taxes and less government regulation.When J. Howard Pew died in 1971, the philanthropy began to evolve, while it remained committed to giving in Philadelphia. The board decided in the late 1980s  that  it would seek national attention. Part of that push came from Rimel. 
	"It had been a bit of a mom and pop operation," says Rimel. "We had grown up slowly. We had a very small staff. The board gave me the directive that we want this to be a national foundation with a  local commitment." With assets of $3.8 billion, the trusts give 20 to 30 percent of their annual contributions to Philadelphia arts and human service groups. Pew also supports population control efforts and contributes to national and international organizations organizations to help meet health needs of at-risk women and children. "I guess if you had to put a tag on us," Rimel says, "we are really trying to help a lot of the organizations and institutions we work with recapture the middle ground."
       But a middle of the road approach is not what some observers see. "I call them liberal, " says Althea K. Nagai, a political scientist who has done statistical grant analyses of the Pew foundation.  "Rimel herself is not a conservative. In one piece about her, she says she was a sixties liberal and wanted to recall the spirit of the times. She says she wanted to bring that kind of spirit to the Pew. But looking at the J. Howard Pew charter, you can see that J. Howard was very much against what we would call today traditional liberalism. He was very conservative."  [see Alternatives in Philanthropy, "The Pew Charitable Trusts: Revitalizing 'the spirit of the 60s,'" November, 1995]
	But today Pew has a full-time director of communications. Its offices are housed on two floors of a swank high-rise office building at 2005 Market Street in Philadelphia's financial district. Each year, Pew receives between 5,000 and 6,000 proposals but generally awards only 500 grants, a ratio of one in ten. In 1995, Pew gave 33 grants of $1 million or over. The majority of the grants _ 35 percent _ were in the $200,000 to $499,999 range. Sixty-seven percent of the grants were distributed nationally, while 24 percent were targeted for Philadelphia-based groups and 9 percent were given to international organizations. 
	The Pew board meets in March, June, September and December to review grant proposals, which generally take up to six months to consider before a decision is made.	
       Six program officers gave $162 million in 1995 in the areas of culture (52 grants), education (43 grants), environment (58 grants), religion (26 grants), public policy (12 grants), health and human services (109 grants) and interdisciplinary (74 grants).
       *Marian A. Godfrey is director of the culture program, which supports working artists and says she wants to strengthen the role of arts and culture in Philadelphia and across the country. Pew is the home base for the Council on Foundation's "Grantmakers in the Arts" affinity group, which has championed  "arts advocacy" and funded many  groups supporting the National Endowment for the Arts in its conflicts with Congress over the use of federal funds for profanity, obscenity, blasphemy and anti-American propaganda.
	*Robert B. Schwartz is director of the education program, which funds elementary and high school education. Pew's emphasis on public school reform does not include support for vouchers, which would enable poor parents to enjoy the same freedom of choice already available to the affluent. 
	*Joshua S. Reichert is director of the environment program, which is interested in global warming, global climate change and global pollution prevention rather than challenging doomsday prophets in the manner of Dr. Julian Simon. 
	*Tamar R. Datan is program officer for the Interdisciplinary Fund, which gives money to the Pew Center for Civic Journalism and last year gave $600,000 to the Academy of Teleivsion Arts and Sciences Foundation for a two-year project to educate and train television writers about the negative effects of gratuitous TV violence, a public relations campaign along the lines of the Joyce Foundation's anti-gun efforts [for a parallel case, see vol.1 no.6, "How Does The Joyce Foundation Deal With Dissent? 'Squash It!'"].
	*Paul C. Light is director of Pew's Public Policy program, whose 1995 goals included promoting economic and political freedom abroad. Over the past six years, Pew has spent nearly $40 million in this program area giving more than 100 grants to promote democracy and market reforms in Eastern and Central Europe. 
	*Joel A. Carpenter is director of religion, a program which offers scholarships and has programs designed to make community ministries and religious leaders more effective.

<h3>USING JOURNALISM AS A TOOL</h3>
<p>
One of the ways to improve civic democracy in America, Rimel believes,  is through what Pew calls civic journalism. Rimel doesn't pretend to be a media junkie. She's a self-avowed techno-peasant who grew up on a farm, and admits she'd be lost on the Internet. Pew recently started up a home page (http://www.pew-trusts.org) that Rimel will have to learn to surf. But she believes the press can be a vehicle for reaching out to citizens and getting them to care about their government and community. Rimel is careful to point out that Pew is not interested in running a newspaper or reforming or reviving a failing newspaper. It is interested in supporting "civic journalism experiments."
	Civic journalism is a theory developed by some academics and old-hand journalists such as David Broder who worry about the future of journalism and what they claim to be its growing negative effect on democracy. Some well-known figures such as Carter speechwriter and Clinton appointee James Fallows say the press' growing cyncism has infected their work and therefore poisoned how Americans view the political process.
	"Our foray into civic journalism is really via the back door," Rimel says. "I've never had any particular interest _ didn't see it as our role, still don't _ how journalism goes about its business. Except we do see it as an issue if journalism can be used as a tool, as a way to get the public reconnected, reinvigorated, recommitted to democratic values," she says. "Increasingly, we understand the power of the press. They  are extraordinarily powerful in shaping opinions and giving people information," she explains. 
	"Given that power, any way that the press might play a role in any kind of experiment in journalism to provide that information in a more effective,  efficient, user-friendly way appeals to us," Rimel says. Rimel first heard about civic journalism from former Knight-Ridder chairman  James K. Batten. As head of the country's second-largest newspaper chain, Batten (who died last year) had already pushed public journalism at some of his 32 newspapers, including the Charlotte Observer, which covered the 1992 elections as a major public journalism project.
	Batten met Rimel in January 1993 when he came to Pew seeking money to help rebuild Miami houses destroyed by Hurricane Andrew.  The subject changed into the depressing topic of how alienated American citizens were becoming from their community, their government and each other. Both were eager to find ways to get citizens more deeply involved in the democratic process. By September 1993, Pew had given television journalist Edward M. Fouhy $3.6 million to open the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington, D.C.
<p>
<a name="Tides"></a>
<h3>PEW'S WASHINGTON CENTER:  ADMINISTERED BY TIDES</h3>
<p>
Federal law prohibits foundations from donating money to for-profit organizations, such as newspapers.  That's why the Pew Charitable Trusts makes its donations to the Tides Foundation, which in turn funds the Pew Center,which pays the newspapers. Tides handles all the Center's paperwork and medical benefits as well as adminstering the grant from one Pew entity to another. On March 15, 1996 the Tides Foundation staff distributed a memorandum to its board of directors denouncing the "disastrous 1994 elections" and "the urgent need for progressives to reverse the gains made by the radical right."
	On the other hand the Center's Washington director, Edward Fouhy, has solid establishment credentials. Fouhy, 61, had been CBS's Saigon bureau chief during the Vietnam war, personally ran both the CBS News and ABC News Washington bureaus.When Batten spoke glowingly of  Fouhy, Rimel sought out the TV veteran in an effort to focus amorphous talk about the media's role in "reconnecting" citizens into a plan for action. 
	Rimel had been prepared to woo Fouhy with flowers and chocolates. But it wasn't necessary. Fouhy says that he had become disgusted with how turned off the public was to the political process. He told Rimel that he thought the press held some responsibility for that.
	Pew "asked me if I could think of a strategy to deal with this growing sense of alienation which they had already sensed," Fouhy says. "It became pretty obvious that if you were going to do the kind of outreach that I recommended in a strategy paper, that you have to have some kind of base." The Pew Center for Civic Journalism was set up to underwrite media partnerships based on Fouhy's strategic recommendation that it was crucial for money be given to television, radio and newspaper partnerships, since that each medium has a particular strength which could be exploited together.   Typically, television and newspapers or radio rarely share information. But Pew-backed media partners are doing just that, co-operating rather than competing in their news coverage.
	 To help this along, Pew gave $600,000 to the Radio-Television News Directors' Foundation to foster partnerships between electronic and print media. "We have some money that we can give $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 out to projects for focus groups, surveys or town meetings,"  says Eric Swanson, director of the Radio-Television Directors' Foundation,  "Whereas the Pew Center for Civic Journalism has more money and can give out $50,000 to $100,000 grants." Swanson's foundation funded five partnerships in 1995.  "Other than the price tag, we are both up to the same goal which is to get enhanced or greater coverage of issues of concern in communities by structuring partnerships between radio, television and print. The typical makeup has been a partnership with a leading daily, a local commercial TV outlet and local radio _ typically it's public radio."
	Pew gave National Public Radio $290,000 directly for its Voter Project in which five public radio stations, tried to cover the 1994 elections in ways that would stimulate citizen interest. Pew gave the project another $250,000 for 1996. To improve election coverage, the Pew Center gave $835,000 to the 1996 Citizen's Election Project, which is run by Stan Cloud, former Time magazine Washington bureau chief. "To me the interesting thing is Pew has set up an election and civic journalism part of their operation  and they distribute their money in lots of different chunks which are kind of all operating independently," says John Dinges, NPR editorial director.  
	Sometimes too independently, it seems. This has led some to question whether Pew is properly overseeing the use of its money. Take for example, overlap between the NPR election project and Cloud's Citizens Election Project. "The strange thing is that the Citizens Election Project funded a number of my stations independent of the NPR Election Project,"says NPR's Dinges.  "I did the election project in 1994 for the '94 election. During 1995, Stan Cloud came in and funded a number of projects for the same partnerships that I set up the previous year. They did Boston, San Francisco, Seattle. All of which I had set up. Stan's projects were for early '96 to focus on the primaries. But my project continues through the election."
	A good example of duplication, says Dinges, is the Voters' Voice project with New Hampshire public radio and a statewide coalition of the Associated Press.  "We weren't able to give them as much money as Stan did," says Dinges. "It turned out it was not a very well coordinated project. Stan came in in the middle, did his thing and most of the time it worked out all right. But it could have been better. The question I would pursue is the separate funding operations. Pew could have made sure they were coordinated. If Ed Fouhy had run the whole thing it probably would have been smoother."

<h3>OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY</h3>
<p>
One of the tenets of public journalism is that reporters need to learn what people are really thinking about. The view among Washington journalists last fall was that the Republican primary would revolve around which candidate was best qualified to help House Speaker Newt Gingrich advance his "Contract with America,"  says Don MacGillis, who coordinated the Boston Globe's Pew-funded civic journalism election project, "People's Voice."  It was Washington wisdom that people outside the Beltway were eager to have the federal budget balanced and taxes cut.
	"The goals of our project were to find out if these really were the issues of concern to New Hampshire voters and then, whatever those concerns turned out to be, to get the candidates to address them," says MacGillis, who spoke at a Pew Center symposium in Washington, D.C. this spring.  Through Pew-funded polling and focus groups and getting to know the people of Derry, N.H. participants learned  residents feared  losing their jobs (even though the state has an extremely low unemployment rate). MacGillis felt vindicated when a surprised, somewhat befuddled Bob Dole announced: "I didn't realize that jobs and trade and what makes America work would become a big issue in the last days of this campaign." 
	A bemused MacGillis told guests at the Pew symposium: "If Dole had been reading the People's Voice articles or listening to the radio and TV programs of our partners, he would have known way back in the fall of 1995 that economic insecurity was a major concern, probably the major concern of New Hampshire voters." Of course, Pat Buchanan's campaign efforts helped draw attention to the pocketbook issue without Pew's subsidy.
	Pew's hope is to find a way to re-connect citizens to the election process by encouraging them to participate in candidate forums and advocating that people _ who often are too apathetic to vote _ go to the polls. The point of civic journalism, say those who practice it, is to take back control of election dialogues from political handlers and candidates.
<p>
<a name="Nobody"></a>
<h3>WHAT IF THEY GAVE A FORUM AND NOBODY CAME?</h3>
<p>
Sounds noble. But what if the candidates just don't want to listen or participate in a civic journalism experiment?  It happened to Dave Iverson,  executive producer for "Citizens '96" sponsored by the Pew-supported Voice of the People Iowa Coalition for Wisconsin Public TV, the Wisconsin State Journal in Madison, six different Iowa newspapers, the Iowa AP, Iowa Public Television, Iowa Public Radio and two commercial TV stations. 
	Their goal was to gather an audience to question the nine presidential candidates in a debate before the Iowa caucuses. About 300 Iowans were primed to ask questions. "Just one problem," says Iverson, "the candidates. Now for months we had done the candidate dance. They were in. They were out. They were in. They were out. They told us every possible version of, this looks good, without ever getting final commitments." 
	On the eve of the broadcast, Iverson had promises from five candidates. Steve Forbes, Pat Buchanan and Lamar Alexander agreed to participate if Bob Dole appeared.  "About 24 hours before the debate itself, Dole made his final decision _ he had been back and forth about it _ and said he wouldn't do it," Iverson says. "Alexander, Buchanan and Forbes who had all made those "this looks good" noises then backed out." Then Phil Gramm pulled out. Then Dick Lugar withdrew. 
	"So we were left with -- and I bet you remember this trio -- Alan Keyes, Bob Dornan and yes, Morry Taylor," says Iverson. "It wasn't a pretty prospect." Six hours before the broadcast, Lugar decided he'd made a promise to the people of Iowa and he'd come. One of the lessons Iverson shared at the civic journalism symposium in Washington, D.C. was that "no matter how sophisticated a media consortium you build, candidates will still act like candidates and make their own strategic decisions."
<p>
<a name="Threats"></a>
<h3>THREATS TO INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY</h3>
<p>
Pew is undeterred by failures such as Iverson's Wisconsin debate. It is similarly resistant to criticism from skeptics such as Washington Post editor Leonard Downie, former New York Times executive editor Max Frankel, columnist Maureen Dowd [see "Why is New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd driving the White House crazy?" in Culture Watch, vol.1, no. 2] or editorial page editor Howell Raines. 
	Frankel told this reporter he has read much of the literature on public journalism and still doesn't get it.  "Some of it sounds like old fashioned reporting," says Frankel, "some of it sounds like getting in bed with the promotion department and that's unfortunate. Some of it sounds downright political."
	However, increasing numbers of journalists seem, in Fouhy's words, to "get it," which often gives critics the impression that public or civic journalism is some kind of growing religious-like movement.  It is difficult for some outsiders to grasp because there are few texts and no specific guidelines or concrete definitions of exactly what is a civic journalism project. 
	Some newspaper veterans are uncomfortable with sponsoring events that they have traditionally covered. Nonetheless, newspaper-radio-television partnerships are lining up with their hands extended for Pew Center grants. To date, the Pew Center has doled out $575,000 to 17 newspaper-radio-television partnerships for community-oriented projects in 1996. This year it will also co-sponsor four seminars on civic journalism in locations around the country.
	"The first year was all criticism," says Jan Schaffer, the Pew Center's deputy director and a former Philadelphia Inquirer business editor. "The second year there was a lot of curiosity and people trying it. The third year is, "How exactly do I do this?"  Over the past three years, the Pew Center has provided money for 34 projects in 24 cities involving partnerships among newspapers, television and radio outlets. Recipients include 22 newspapers, 24 television stations and 20 radio stations. Pew grants pay for items that would normally be outside a newsroom's normal operating budget. It is not to be used to buy newsprint or cover a reporter's salary.
	Moreover, the money comes with strings. It may only  be used for such items as polling, an expense many news outlets say they can no longer afford. The pressure for high profits, particularly at corporately-owned newspapers, has forced many newsroom managers to slash budgets to raise revenue. So Pew money fills in the gaps. Pew money is also used to hold town meetings, conduct focus groups to learn what people are thinking about _ and sometimes Pew  pays for the salary of a "newsroom coordinator," who sets up town meetings and functions much like a community organizer.
	This year's Pew grants range in size form $5,000 to $61,000. While large foundations such as Ford, Robert Wood Johnson, Knight and Kaiser have given money to the press, it is often used for seminars, press education or for fellowships to individual reporters. It is rarely given directly to newspapers or commercial electronic outlets. For example, Harvard's Nieman fellowships are given to reporters, not to the newspaper. They are stipends which replace salaries while reporters conduct their studies.
	These sorts of grants can generate controversy themselves. Two years ago a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant to NBC for a two-hour televised discussion on health reform aroused criticism from other members of the media _ even though that foundation, like the Pew trusts, claimed it had exercised no editorial control. "For foundations to give grants to commercial newspapers to carry out tasks or information gathering would be very unusual," says Waldemar Nielsen, a noted author on the activities of foundations and columnist for the Chronicle of Philanthropy. 
	A thirteen-member advisory board, made up mostly of journalists (many of them Fouhy's friends), decides how Pew's money should be spent. Money goes only to media partnerships _ as opposed to a single news outlet _ for projects that carry out a civic journalism project. The goal is to reach consensus about a problem and its solution.  Funds cannot  be used merely for research. Eligible  media projects might focus on education, transportation or neighborhood safety. Members of the Pew Center for Civic Journalism advisory board, made up largely of journalists, approve the topics. "I don't have any relationship with the Pew Board," says Fouhy. "If they walked in the door, I wouldn't recognize them. I've never met them. They don't know who we fund until we let them know. Independence is one of the tenets of this whole thing. We wouldn't be here if we didn't have that independence."
	Pew grantmakers hope their money will be used to start an experiment  which media outlets will continue. "A lot of papers are going to be increasingly saying:  'We ought not to take money,' " says University of Maryland journalism professor Hodding Carter III, a member of the advisory board. "Pew is not in the business of subsidizing newspapers. We are in the business of encouraging the idea" of civic journalism.
	But Roberto Suro, deputy national editor of the Washington Post,  has taken the role of resident skeptic on the Pew advisory board. Suro is concerned about the threats to the independence and integrity of reporters dependent upon Pew-funded coordinators. 
	For example, Charlene Price-Patterson handled logistics for public journalism events sponsored by the Charlotte Observer, WSOC-TV and two radio stations. Price-Patterson only worked temporarily at the paper.  She is not a reporter but a community activist. Although technically she did not work for Pew, her Observer salary did not go towards traditional news-gathering activities. Price-Patterson arranged child care, refreshments and transportation and spent some time "knocking on doors to publicize the event," she wrote in the Pew Center's newsletter.

<h3>"WE MAKE PLENTY OF MONEY"</h3>

Some journalists by nature prefer to think of themselves as lone cowboys who have the skills to go in and rope their own cattle. They don't need to hire someone else to do the job, many would say. "If I was a newspaper editor," says Suro, "I would not feel comfortable having someone in that position and particularly not in the newsroom." Price-Patterson's desk was located in the newsroom.
	Jim Walser coordinated the Observer's "Taking Back Our Neighborhoods" project which won last year's $25,000 James K. Batten  award. He says some reporters did feel uneasy about having a coordinator in the newsroom. "But from the standpoint of the editors, it worked well," he adds. "Charlene wasn't putting stories in the newspaper. She was giving us information. She knew a hell of a lot more people in the neighborhoods than any of our neighborhood reporters."
	Last year, former Philadelphia Inquirer associate editor Fran Dauth was in the market for a new job. One of the many newspapers that was interested in hiring her was the San Francisco Chronicle. In talking with Chronicle managing editor Dan Rosenheim, she asked if his paper had taken any Pew money. He told her it had for an election project. Dauth questioned why the Chronicle didn't use its own money to pay for reporting. Rosenheim cited budget constraints, although the paper was making a profit.
	"I don't know any particular evil about taking money from Pew," Dauth says.  Now an editor with New Jersey's Newark Star Ledger, she adds, "But it seems to go against the training of what we do. The newspapers are taking money from an outside source. The outside source says, "You can have this money if you do this kind of story." It also seems to me once you become dependent on an outside source to finance the project, you give up independence."
	Witness the Philadelphia Inquirer, a prestigious Knight-Ridder newspaper with a slew of Pulitzer prizes. Last year, the Inquirer found itself at the center of a media flap when it hired urban expert Neil Peirce for an editorial board project on regionalism. The Inquirer paid for the project. But Peirce had received money for expenses indirectly from the New Era Foundation. When the Wall Street Journal reported New Era was an elaborate Ponzi scheme which had ensnared dozens of charities, the Inquirer was tarred.  
	Ironically, the Inquirer had earlier applied to the Pew Center for Civic Journalism, but had been turned down. However, the paper was invited to resubmit its application after making a few changes. 
	But Inquirer Editor Maxwell E. P. King says the paper has since decided it should not take foundation money and did not reapply.  "At this point," says King, "I'd be very, very reluctant to take any funding from any foundation for a journalism project because I'd worry whether that would impinge on the independence of the newspaper. Besides, we make plenty of money. We can fund our own journalism."

<h3>MONEY AS GUILT, PHILANTHROPY AS THERAPY, AND THE LEGACY OF WEALTH</h3>
<p>
<I>by Robert Huberty</I>
<p>
	<I>The Legacy of Inherited Wealth: Interviews With Heirs</I>, edited by Barbara Blouin with Katherine Gibson and Margaret Kiersted (Trio Press, 1995, paperback, 185 pages, $14.95.  Available from The Inheritance Project, Inc., 3291 Deer Run Rd., Blacksburg, VA 24060, 540/552-8436.<P>

	Karl Marx thought capitalism would make workers so miserable and angry that they would develop a class consciousness, rise up in revolution, and overthrow their oppressors.  Marx's social theory, which disastrously misled politicians and intellectuals for a century, failed in a number of ways.  It did not forsee the astonishing productivity of the free market.  It cannot account for the enormous middle class of producers and consumers that Western society has created.  Finally, it did not anticipate that successful capitalists would apparently make their own children so miserable and angry that they would throw away their opportunities, seek therapy, and they (not the workers) would use their inherited wealth to create the collectivist society Marx wanted. 
	The editors of this volume have identified such people.  The children of the very rich are much envied but little studied. Unlike most citizens in a modern competitive marketplace, they are not compelled to make enough money to acquire goods.  Like the poor, they have been left out of our wealth-producing system.  But while the problems of poor people occasion much public policy debate, no one pays much attention to those who inherit so much money that working is purely a matter of personal choice.  The editors, themselves heirs and founders in 1992 of a group called The Inheritance Project, Inc., have remedied this neglect by interviewing seventeen adult heirs.  The Legacy of Inherited Wealth records their stories.  In their own words, they tell us what it's like to grow up rich. 
	Now for those of  us who didn't grow up rich, it is tempting to report gleefully that most heirs, as recorded in these narratives, seem pathetically unhappy.  Gifted novelists of manners have written many stories about lives like theirs, often with comic irony or as satires.  But these first person accounts of messy and misspent lives deserve sympathy.  The stories perceptively weave sad self-descriptions with compelling sagas of family life over several generations.  (The editors, who hold advanced degrees in literature, have no doubt helped here.)  One cannot help but feel pity for sons and daughters raised to be so financially secure, yet so emotionally lost and economically ignorant. 
	The legacy of inherited wealth described here is not one of personal pride in family accomplishments.  Instead, it is one of acute psychological distress over not knowing how to handle amounts of money that others can only dream of.  Confusion, self-pity and guilt permeate the tales of these heirs who have intense memories of their families, but who often seem to enjoy no personal ties to them.  The heirs' stories show how deeply affected they are by the strong wills and striking personalities of their parents and grandparents, but they describe their own lives as drifting and listless.  As each tells his own story, certain common patterns emerge.
	*Money is a crutch:  David Bowman wants a serious and creative career, but he notes how easily he falls back on the privileges of his wealth when the demands of his projects become too stressful.
	*Money is a puzzle:  Rebecca Hutchins receives regular dividends from her grandfather's trust.  She is bored and confused by financial advice and is ashamed to admit it.  But trying to actively manage her wealth would require that she overcome her passivity and deal with her difficult family.
	*Money is a trap: Rachel Halpern was taught the work ethic by her parents.  She thinks she should be paid for her work and treated no differently from her co-workers.  But she feels guilty demanding a wage from a hard-pressed employer when her trusts are worth $<br>6 million.  
	*Money is a threat:  Fred Hopgood is afraid that others will take advantage of his money.  His friendships and marriage end because of his suspicions.
	*Money is a double-edged weapon:  Several heirs choose marriage partners to spite their families and repudiate their privileged upbringing.  But then they resent writing checks to support their poor, unfashionable or reckless spouses.
	The founders of The Inheritance Project have encouraged heirs to tell their stories for reasons they provide in a project brochure.  They think that by talking about the impact of inherited wealth on their lives, heirs will "break the isolation and challenge the taboos surrounding wealth."  Heirs will also learn how others have "claimed their personal power and used it to benefit others."  And they will become familiar with "networking and educational resources to heirs and professionals who work with them."
	The Inheritance Project at first appears to be some sort of recovery group, albeit one serving a very exclusive clientele.  Heirs are invited to set up confidential appointments to share their feelings and experiences with a sympathetic listener.  But some aspects of it (evident in lists of workshops, contacts, and publications) suggest that the Project encourages yet another bizarre form of postmodern identity politics.  It is intimated that heirs _ the term "heiress," I suspect, is inadmissable _ will discover their common victimization, become empowered to reclaim their identities, and will work to overcome the forces that oppress them and separate them from others.  
	Several heirs explain in their interviews that they are doing just that.  Wendy Johnson reports that she no longer feels guilty about her wealth.  She has sold the defense stocks in her $1 million investment portfolio and invested her daughter's trust in Working Assets Mutual Funds, which screens out companies that are not socially responsible.  Chuck Collins has given away his inheritance and attends "wealth conferences" organized by the Haymarket People's Fund which is committed to funding "change, not charity."  (Collins' work with community housing loan funds and land trusts has taught him that the home mortgage interest deduction is a "mansion subsidy" for the rich.)  Deborah Frank contributes her income from seven irrevocable trusts to grassroots community development groups.  "With one stroke, I am able to help support community development and get even with my parents, too."
	But this poses a problem, in that it discourages heirs from becoming true philanthropists and helping others to escape poverty. Heirs who think they are not really entitled to their families' fortunes are not likely to support philanthropies that offer the poor the means to acquire wealth.  After all, if wealth only creates unearned privilege, then there is no nobility in encouraging others to pursue it.  Heirs who contribute instead to causes that prevent the accumulation of wealth will overcome the conditions that leave them feeling guilty.  The resulting condition leaves everyone poorer. Karl Marx, call your psychiatrist!

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>
	Regarding your recent essay about the Joyce Foundation [vol. 1, no.6, July, 1996], there are several factual errors in the few paragraphs relating to the Joyce-funded project in Indiana. As a journalist for the past 19 years, I have always found it useful to actually interview the people I write about -- no one called me. Most notably, you criticize the Indianpolis Star over its excellent series of stories about the role of money in the state legislature, "Of course, the story paid scant attention to the interests of foundations or the power of their money."
	Such a comment is flat-out wrong. The Indianapolis Star coverage disclosed and credited both the Joyce Foundation support and the Center for Public Integrity for creating a 19,000-document database from 1994 campaign records chronicling contributions to Republicans and Democrats, from individuals, labor unions, law firms, etc. If someone contributed money to the process, it was recorded at the state election commission, in the Center database, in the Indianapolis Star, and elsewhere. As you know, philanthropic foundations do not make political contributions.	
	The work in Indianapolis is a spectacular, unprecedented example of vital information about our democracy being made availabe to the public. Legislators in Indiana and other states use taxpayer money to buy themselves laptop computers, but keep information about who is bankrolling their political campaigns on less accessible "paper" records physically kept in a single location in the state.
	The project is nonpartisan, non-ideological and about something every American today supports: free and open public discourse and disclosure about our political process. Today, the citizens of Indiana know more about who funds their state legislature than they ever have. Humbly stated, we think that is important.
<p>Charles Lewis <br>
Executive Director<br>
The Center for Public Integrity<br>
Washington, DC<br>
<p>
<p>
	We did not call Charles Lewis because we had already talked to  him in person on April 14, 1996 at the Council on Foundations meeting in Atlanta after he presented the results of  the Center for Public Integrity's  "Statehouse Sellout" project -- on a panel which did not contain a single conservative or Republican representative [for more on the conference, see vol.1, no. 5, "The Council on Foundations Message To America: The Era Of Lady Bountiful Is Over"].
	Our account of the Center for Public Integrity's activies in Indiana is accurate. In fact, Lewis now confirms that his series ignored political activities of foundations such as Joyce, using the legal prohibition on philanthropic campaign contributions as a rationale. That is a legalism that has nothing to do with the question of  integrity with which his organization purports to be concerned. Many foundations classify political activities as "educational" or "outreach" in order to get around such strictures. 
	Lewis's claims to non-ideological  nonpartisanship are similarly suspect. The advisory board of the Center for Public Integrity on his letterhead lists Mother Jones contributor Molly Ivins, Carter administration State Department spokesman Hodding Carter, and Kennedy administration aide Arthur Schle-singer, Jr. on a clearly pro-liberal Democrat roster of names.
	We raised this issue of bias to Lewis in the specific case of ties between Minister Louis Farrakhan, his affiliated organizations and individuals, and the Democrats.  When we personally spoke with Lewis in Atlanta we had asked: Had his organization ever published a single investigation of ties between the Nation of Islam and the Democrats? His reply was negative. When will you do so?, we pressed. "You'll have to read our magazine," he said. We are still waiting.

<h2>Federal Funding for the CPB Is Neither Necessary Nor Deserved</h2>
<i>March 6, 1996</i>
<P>
WASHINGTON - When the 104th Congress cut federal payments to the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 1995, funding pledges to
CPB-funded stations increased 12.9 percent in a single month,
and total dollars pledged grew by 15.3 percent This rise in private
donations is one of two major reasons why taxpayer dollars should
no longer be used to support the CPB.
<P>
&quot;Events have shown that public broadcasting has other sources
of revenue which, if properly utilized, can more than make up
for the small fraction of the budget provided by the federal government
through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,&quot; said Laurence
Jarvik, Ph.D., <A HREF="/crc/fw">Foundation Watch</A> editor and
cultural studies fellow at Capital Research Center. <I>Foundation
Watch</I><B> </B>monitors the activities of philanthropic foundations
such as those which support the CPB and its affiliates.
<P>
In <A HREF="#testimony">testimony</A> Wednesday before the House
Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, Health and Human Services,
and Education, Jarvik cited facts and figures proving private
donations to public broadcasting entities around the country can
more than make up for cuts in federal funding. For instance, Santa
Monica, California's National Public Radio (NPR) station, KCRW,
raised $1.09 million in a single February pledge drive, a 26 percent
rise over the previous year.
<P>
Not only does the Corporation for Public Broadcasting need no
taxpayer dollars to fund its operations, Jarvik said it doesn't
deserve them either. He listed nine examples of politically-biased
decisions from the CPB, the Public Broadcasting System and NPR,
including the rejection of Christian Coalition Executive Director
Ralph Reed's request to reply to NPR commentator Andrei Codrescru's
declaration that some basic evangelical Christian beliefs are
&quot;crap&quot; and that he hoped four million believers would
be &quot;evaporated.&quot;
<P>
&quot;In large measure CPB has not been reauthorized due to its
own failures to insure the integrity of the public broadcasting
system, maintain its balance, oversee its objectivity or guarantee
its managerial competence,&quot; Jarvik said.
<P>
Jarvik has testified before this congressional committee in the
past, and has edited three books concerning the federal government's
role in the arts: &quot;The National Endowments: A Critical Symposium&quot;;
&quot;Public Broadcasting and the Public Trust&quot;; and &quot;Masterpiece
Theatre and the Politics of Quality.&quot; He earned his doctorate
and master of fine arts in film and television from UCLA, where
he was Hugh Downs Fellow and winner of the Distinguished Scholar
Award.

<P>

Mr. Chairman, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting
me to testify today regarding the appropriation for the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for Fiscal Year 1999. I am Cultural
Studies Fellow at the Capital Research Center and editor of <I>Foundation
Watch</I>, a newsletter which covers the activities of philanthropic
foundations such as those which support PBS and NPR.
<P>
Last year, when I testified before this subcommittee, the Speaker
of the House had just announced that in order to help balance
the budget and reduce the federal deficit, he would &quot;zero
out&quot; the federal subsidy for public broadcasting because
it was an unnecessary Federal expenditure. The Speaker was right
then, and his statement has withstood the test of time. Events
have shown that public broadcasting has other sources of revenue
which, if properly utilized, can more than make up for the small
fraction of the budget provided by the Federal government through
the CPB. According to &quot;MediaNomics,&quot; (a publication
of Brent Bozell's Media Research Center) an analysis by editor
Tim Lamer of PBS's reported fundraising totals reveals that after
Congress cut the federal payment to PBS last year, overall revenues
to local stations from private donors <I>increased substantially</I>
more than making up for the reduction in federal spending, at
no cost to the American taxpayer.
<P>
According to Lamer, for example, Santa Monica California's NPR
station, KCRW, raised $1.09 million in a single February pledge
drive, a 26 percent rise over the previous year. Arkansas Educational
Television surpasssed its $350,000 fundraising goal while reducing
pledge breaks by 10 percent. KRMA, in Denver, Colorado, reported
a 13 percent uptick, and WETA in Washington, DC announced 62 percent
of a $1 million drive came <I>from new members</I>. KCET, Los
Angeles released a figure of $1.68 million, some $205,000 more
than in 1994. Overall, March 1995 pledges were 12.9 percent higher
than in 1994, and total dollars pledged were up by 15.3 percent.
Lamer notes private foundations also increased their contributions.
In 1994 Chicago's MacArthur Foundation gave $1,295,470. Last year
it provided $4,139,700. The Mott Foundation gave $590,000 in 1994,
$935,000 in 1995. The Pew Charitable Trusts increased its contribution
level from $2,740,000 in 1994 to $3,896,000 in 1995.
<P>
And successful private fundraising continues. Just this week,
for example, Channel 26 reported some $177,820 in pledges, including
over $35,000 from an airing of a Peter, Paul, and Mary concert
film, and what the <I>Washington Post</I> called an &quot;astounding&quot;
$94,389 from a one-night-only &quot;Les Miserables in Concert.&quot;
In New York, the same program netted $400,000 in only 3 1/2 hours.
PBS has been proud to announce a number of lucrative business
deals, most notably as $75 million agreement with <I>Reader's
Digest</I> to produce new programs for the network.
<P>
PBS program producers have also managed to make a number of new
deals, with Children's Television Workshop (CTW), producers of
<I>Sesame Street</I>, announcing the start of a children's cable
channel, for example. One might remind the subcommittee that Children's
Television Workshop continues its lucrative licensing, merchandising,
and other fundraising endeavors which result in gross sales of
almost a billion dollars a year in related merchandise, and gross
revenues to CTW of approximately $100 million annually.
<P>
Despite recent revelations about Chinese human rights violations
by activists such as Harry Wu whom I was honored to meet at a
Progress and Freedom Foundation reception &quot;Sesame Street&quot;
products can be found today on the shelves clearly marked &quot;Made
In China.&quot; China still bans political dissent, persecutes
Christians, forces women to have abortions, and operates orphanages
which are unhealthy for children. And, as AFL-CIO spokeswoman
Chyrol Graeve has noted, &quot;toy workers are paid less than
a dollar an hour.&quot; More than 250 Asian toy workers have lost
their lives in the past two years as the result of fires and other
industrial accidents. Nevertheless, Children's Television Workshop
continues to pay its top executives six figure salaries while
licensing to toy companies who manufacture in Asia. It is highly
questionable whether a reasonable case can be made that enterprises
with such manifest insensitivity to human rights violations deserve
continued federal subsidy at any level.
<P>
There can be no doubt that had Congress followed through on the
original privatization plan endorsed at the time by the entire
Congressional leadership including Appropriations Committee Chairman
Livingston and Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Pressler and
still evident in the public positions taken by the Dole and Buchanan
campaigns, for example public broadcasting might have been fully
self-sufficient today. We would not need to be spending time discussing
appropriation levels for 1999, some three years hence, for an
entity which has not been reauthorized.
<P>
In large measure CPB has not been reauthorized due to its own
failures to insure the integrity of the public broadcasting system,
maintain its balance, oversee its objectivity, or guarantee its
managerial competence. CPB's record was called &quot;contempt
of Congress&quot; in an issue of <I>Comint: A Journal About Public
Media</I> last year. Nothing has transpired to change that evaluation.
Certainly, CPB does not deserve any sort of &quot;trust fund&quot;
because it has lost its right to the public trust through its
own mismanagement.
<P>
Evidence of CPB's failure to exercise effective oversight of the
public broadcasting system has been widely reported over the last
year. Some examples of problems which CPB has failed to resolve
are:
<UL>
<LI>As I reported in the <A HREF="/crc/fw/fw-v1n1.html">premiere issue of Foundation Watch</A>,
(February, 1996) PBS's so-called &quot;Democracy Project&quot;
has been more like the Democrat project. I could not get the name
of a single Republican staffer in a decision-making job dealing
with coverage of the 1996 election at PBS from the director of
the project, who happens to be the wife of a Clinton political
appointee in the State Department. In what seems like deliberate
challenge to even the appearance of balance and objectivity as
required by law, PBS's new director of communications is the former
political director for the Clinton White House. Incredibly, PBS
does not feel the slightest obligation for even a token Republican
executive in the programming department.
<LI>PBS's so-called &quot;National Issues Convention&quot; was
rife with the appearance of conflict-of-interest and misrepresentation
of its goals and methods. Misleading at best in its claim to be
a &quot;deliberative poll&quot; former CBS polling chief Warren
Mitofsky declared it &quot;was not deliberative and not a poll&quot;
false and deceptive at worst, PBS had sponsored a &quot;pseudo-event&quot;
which wasted some $4 million dollars, approximately half of which
is reportedly straight from the PBS budget. PBS also provided
some nine hours of valuable airtime which could have produced
additional revenue streams to the network.
<LI>PBS rejected <I>The Children of Table 34</I>, a documentary
produced in cooperation with the <A HREF="http://www.frc.org">Family Research Council</A>
(FRC), about the controversy over the use of underage children
for sex research by Dr. Kinsey. The story was reported in <I>The
Washington Post </I>Style section. But PBS declined to help the
Family Research Council to bring this case before the American
public. Yet, as Robert Knight, director of Cultural Studies for
the FRC points out, PBS stations repeated <I>Tales of the City</I>,
a program many found highly offensive for its use of profanity,
glamorization of drug use, and sexual promiscuity.
<LI>PBS rejected <I>Covering Cuba</I>, and independent film by
Augustin Blazquez, which detailed the mainstream media's infatuation
with Fidel Castro since 1959. He first offered his picture in
October, 1995 and Blazquez volunteered to re-edit the film to
meet PBS standards. Despite numerous pro-Castro films on PBS,
and an obvious need for balance in this regard, Blazquez was not
given a chance to air his picture on PBS. Ironically, only a few
weeks ago, Castro's planes shot down American citizens in an incident
which confirmed Blazquez's depiction of the Cuban dictator and
his policies.
<LI>PBS has still not aired an episode of <I>The American Experience</I>
to correct &quot;Holocaust revisionism&quot; in <I>Liberators:
Fighting on Two Fronts in World War II.</I> Congressman Laughlin
of Texas has delivered a speech denouncing this hoax on the House
floor. Colonel James Moncrief, Jr. the senior surviving officer
of the Sixth Armored Division which actually liberated Buchenwald
presented written testimony to the authorizing subcommittee asking
that PBS correct the historical record. I personally met with
Congressman Joel Hefley of Colorado and Col. Moncrief right here
in the Rayburn Building to discuss this problem. Colonel Moncrief
has written numerous letters to PBS and CPB, yet the network still
refuses to air a documentary about the actual liberators of the
Nazi camps. If I could find them and I introduced Col. Moncrief
to a senior staffer on Senator Pressler's Commerce Committee as
well so could PBS. CPB has done nothing whatever in this case,
despite its legal obligation to insure the excellence and integrity
of public broadcasting, and the offer of Col. Moncrief's help.
<LI><I>Frontline</I> has aired a number of troubling documentaries
in the past year, including a show about the Speaker of the House
which included gratuitous footage of a heckler making offensive
and possibly obscene remarks about allegations of sexual indiscretions;
another program about killings at an abortion clinic in which
four-letter words were used without being bleeped, and in relation
to which a number of women came forward to allege (in a story
reported by Peter Steinfels in the <I>New York Times</I>) that
their point-of-view had been omitted by the producers as a symptom
of anti-Catholic bias; and a third program this year, about campaign
contributions, which was so unbalanced that even liberal columnist
David Broder condemned it in <I>The Washington Post </I>for presenting
a distorted portrayal of both the Clinton administration and Congress.
Neither CPB nor PBS have announced any balancing programming for
any of these cases.
</UL>

<P>
At NPR, the situation has not been any better. Some examples give
evidence of CPB failure to provide reasonable oversight:

<LI>NPR commentator Andrei Codrescru declared that some basic
evangelical Christian beliefs were &quot;crap&quot; and that he
hoped four million believers would be &quot;evaporated.&quot;
Although after protests, did NPR issue a lame apology, Christian
Coalition executive director Ralph Reed's request for two minutes
of NPR airtime to reply to the attack was flatly refused. No editors
or executives have been publicly disciplined for permitting the
commentary on the air.
</UL>

<P>
In a letter dated February 27, 1996, Rev. Donald Wildmon of the
American Family Association wrote that &quot;it is absurd for
the government to be in the public broadcasting business...There
are more than 1300 Christian broadcasters in America. Our government
will not give them one penny. But we readily give those billions
to PBS, NPR and CPB. This is nothing more than censorship by the
government, to fund one perspective and not another...It is time
for PBS, NPR, and CPB to get off the government welfare dole and
get out and raise their money like other broadcasters do.&quot;
<UL>
<LI>NPR has not yet asked for a refund of commentary fees paid
to convicted murderer Mumia Abu-Jamal for his <I>Live from Death
Row</I>, the book based on these un-aired programs (because of
protests from critics such as Senator Dole) which is being sold
commercially.
<LI>NPR stations recently broadcast &quot;Blacklisted&quot; at
a cost of $160,00, half of which was paid by CPB itself. The three-part
series was produced by the son of screenwriter Gordon Kahn, and
portrayed his father as &quot;unjustly persecuted,&quot; by anti-Communists,
as Accuracy in Media's Reed Irvine notes, in &quot;an extreme
form of the sanitized obituary.&quot; Irvine points out that Kahn,
as a Communist Party member, was &quot;part of Stalin's secret
team in Hollywood...no more decent and honest than Hitler's favorite
movie maker, Leni Riefenstahl.&quot; According to Irvine, &quot;Communists
were trying to impose upon America and the world a system that
was at least as evil, oppressive and dangerous as the Nazism we
fought a war to defeat and destroy.&quot;
</UL>

<P>
&quot;Kahn and his comrades failed to bring about the triumph
of Communism,&quot; says Irvine. &quot;It is not they, but those
who worked to stop them that NPR should honor.&quot; As of this
date, I am not aware of any three-hour NPR series presenting Reed
Irvine's point of view, or honoring anti-Communists in Hollywood
such as former President Ronald Reagan.
<P>
Unfortunately, time does not permit mentioning all the outstanding
problems in public broadcasting. Let me just conclude with the
scandal reported in the <I>Washington Post</I> recently, where
an innocent member of the CPB board of directors who had been
concerned with questions of financial mismanagement found herself
smeared as a sex harasser after confidential personnel documents
were leaked to reporters. CPB spent an estimated $20,000 on lawyers
&quot;investigating&quot; this matter, yet never managed to get
around to asking the alleged perpetrator what had happened, nor
giving that person the right to self defense.
<P>
Yet CPB has never managed to explain precisely how the documents
got to the press, nor how management could justify the expenditure
of tax dollars <I>when no formal complaint of sexual harassment
had ever been filed. </I>This widely reported case is evidence
that there is something very wrong in public broadcasting, sufficiently
wrong that even thinking about funding for the year 1999 should
simply be postponed pending the outcome of an investigation into
how CPB treats such questions as allegations of sexual harassment,
and what efforts are made to preserve the privacy of personnel
files.
<P>
In addition, articles in the <I>Sunday Times of London</I> contained
allegations attributed to CPB officials which were later found
to be without a basis in fact against the First Lady. As of this
date, I have not been able to find out who made the charges, which
were characterized at the time by CPB board member Victor Gold
as part of a &quot;smear.&quot; Insofar as CPB is required to
maintain the integrity of news and current affairs programming
for PBS, NPR, and Pacifica, CPB should determine who was behind
this &quot;smear,&quot; and invoke appropriate sanctions. If CPB
will not do this, Congress has an obligation to investigate this
matter, which is a serious blemish on the character and trustworthiness
of public broadcasting.
<P>
Until such basic questions as those above have been fully answered
by CPB, it certainly should not receive any advanced appropriation.
There are two years for CPB to resolve these concerns by 1998,
when appropriations for 1999 are to be determined by Congress.
The intervening period should be used by Congress to fully exercise
its oversight responsibilities. I remain confident any reasonable
review will conclude that continued federal funding for the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting is unnecessary, unwise, and contrary to
the best interests of the American public and public broadcasting
itself.

<CENTER><H2>If They Only Knew Then What We Know Now About the AARP</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>by Terrence Scanlon</CENTER>
<CENTER>President, Capital Research Center</H3><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
 When my parents joined the American Association of Retired Persons,
they thought like many seniors that they were getting affordable
supplemental health insurance, manageable credit card interest
rates and an attractive magazine.  But there is much more to the
AARP than most of its members know.  The AARP is a taxpayer-funded
lobbyist that actively promotes bigger government and, ultimately,
more spending on itself.<BR>
<P>
 The federal government uses tax-exempt, non-profit organizations
like AARP to run the thousands of programs that make up the welfare
state.  These groups receive, on average, about half their funding
from Uncle Sam.  These subsidies give them the clout to form a
&quot;shadow government&quot; inside the Washington Beltway to
lobby incessantly for more welfare programs, more regulation and
higher taxes.  AARP promotes rent control laws, raising the minimum
wage and increa sing the gasoline tax.  All these programs make
seniors more dependent on government.<BR>
<P>
 The AARP, the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC) and
dozens of lesser-known organizations that make up the seniors
lobby have become expert at using the elderly to build their own
power.<BR>
<P>
 For instance, in 1992 the federal government gave the AARP $86
million for senior employment and tax preparation programs.  Additionally,
because the AARP is a tax-exempt, non-profit organization, you
and I worked to make up the difference on the taxes the AARP did
not pay on the $191 million it earned in 1993 by selling insurance,
pharmaceuticals and auto-club services.  <BR>
<P>
 Another big recipient of federal funds is the National Council
of Senior Citizens (NCSC). In 1993, it received 96 percent of
its $76-million budget ($73 million) from the federal government.
 While this money can't legally be used for lobbying, taxpayers
still indirectly finance AARP and NCSC lobbying.  Money is &quot;fungible,&quot;
which is another way of saying that government dollars free-up
other dollars for lobbying.<BR>
<P>
 Recently, these two organizations raised their taxpayer-funded
voices loud enough to drown out reports on the coming bankruptcy
of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  These are the three
federal programs on which the elderly rely most.  Trustees of
these programs report that America's aging population will spend
the money in their coffers faster than the smaller, working-age
population can re-fill them.  That leaves America with two alternatives
-- reduce benefits for the retired or increase taxes on workers.
<BR>
<P>
 If we raise taxes, the cost of Social Security and Medicare by
2040 will eat up an economy-busting 35-55 percent of every worker's
paycheck.  The 104th Congress decided instead to slow the rise
in Medicare benefits, proposing an increase from $4,800 per patient
in 1995 to $6,500 in 2001.  But AARP and NCSC shouted down this
attempt at true reform with bogus charges of &quot;cutting&quot;
benefits for enrollees.<BR>
<P>
 In its new book, <U>Frightening America's Elderly:  How the Age
Lobby Holds Seniors Captive</U>, Capital Research Center documents
how the seniors lobby promotes costly and inefficient government
programs, mandates and regulations while securing tax dollars
for itself.  Author Thomas diLorenzo alerts seniors that such
programs are bankrupting our country and jeopardizing their grandchildren's
futures without increasing their own security and independence.
<BR>
<P>
 The special interest lobbyists whose paychecks are tied to failed
welfare-state programs are stalling innovative reforms.  Americans,
young and old, need to know what they are doing.  <U>Frightening
America's Elderly</U> is the first step toward opening our eyes.
 I wish my parents had known then what I know now.<BR>

<center><H3>Preface<br>
by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY)</H3></center>
<P>
<P>
<P>        Imagine for a moment a thriving business enterprise, pulling in annual revenues of hundreds 
of millions of dollars.  Imagine, too, that through a quirk in the law, this business pays none of the 
income taxes to which its competitors are subjected.  Exorbitant salaries and benefits are paid from 
this huge tax-free income, and employees work in splendor in an enormous palace complete with 
marble floors and every possible manner of technological luxury.
<P>        Let us also imagine that this business has also succeeded in becoming the most powerful 
lobbying force in Washington, completely dwarfing and dominating some of the more publicized 
groups such as the NRA, the NEA, or the Christian Coalition.  The surest measure of its success is 
the amount of federal spending which its lobbying has succeeded in persuading Washington to 
spend on its clients--in this case, the business's millions of loyal customers.  Year upon year, 
without exception, the largest increases in federal spending are awarded to those in the group, even 
to the point where the projections are that every penny of federal tax revenue will be awarded to 
them in the early 21st century.
<P>        Imagine as well that most of the customers of the business have little or no idea of what it is 
up to.  Suppose that many of the customers believe in limited government, and firmly and 
repeatedly say that they oppose continued escalations in tax rates.  Suppose that the executives 
controlling the business are aware that many of their customers either do not favor the huge 
escalation in federal spending which they are advocating, or are unaware of it.  Nonetheless, this 
influential business informs officeholders in the national government that failure to continue to 
increase spending in this manner will draw the united electoral wrath of the customers--33,000,000 
strong.
<P>        Now suppose that this business is favored each year with tens of millions of dollars in direct 
grants from the federal government.  The American taxpayer thus pays directly for the services 
purchased by the grants, activities which serve to spread the good name and reputation of our 
"hypothetical" business.
<P>        Ah, but--incredible though it may seem, there is such a business--the American Association 
of Retired Persons.  Only recently have many Americans come to understand what this group is 
really all about.  I have often referred to them as 33,000,000 people bound together by a common 
love of airline discounts--and insurance discounts--and pharmacy discounts.  Because, in my view, 
that is exactly who their members are--common, thoughtful, patriotic people who know a "pretty 
good deal" when they see one, and yet have no desire whatsoever to bankrupt the government, the 
nation, and their grandkids.
<P>        While I was serving on the President's Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax 
Reform, I was intrigued and perplexed by the testimony that the AARP presented before the 
Commission.  We showed the AARP representatives the clear and irrefutable data revealing that the 
federal government was headed towards extremities of debt, driven almost wholly by growth in 
spending on the AARP's membership (i.e., senior citizens.)  We sought the counsel of the AARP 
about just how to avoid the certainty of national ruin that resided in maintaining the status quo.  
They didn't bat an eye.  They not only defended every single penny of projected federal spending 
increases, but presented more demands for an additional trillion dollars in spending above that.  
They could just as easily have said, "Let them eat cake."
<P>        Mystified by the willful irresponsibility of this
organization, I determined to learn more about who they were and what was driving their activities. 
<P> I was intrigued to learn that most of the AARP's money did not come in the form of dues from the 
people it claimed to represent, hut rather from an enormous tax-free business empire.  I was 
absolutely flabbergasted to find that the federal government had given $86,000,000 in grants to this 
political behemoth in just the past year.
<P>        When I became Chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy, I 
began to hold hearings into the nature of this beast.  A story began to unravel, of a complexity 
which I could not possibly track.  I had no special investigative staff and quickly found that there 
was no simple answer to the question, "What is the AARP?"
<P>        When asking about how it was founded and funded, we learned that its origin lay with a 
man who once had been stripped of his license to sell insurance and had hit upon this ingenious 
method of running an awesome insurance empire tax-free.  When asking about how AARP became 
hooked up with Prudential Insurance, we found that the precipitating event was a lawsuit involving 
a former AARP Executive Director who, after being sacked by the AARP, alleged various 
corruptions and illegalities in the relationship between AARP and Colonial Penn insurance, its 
previous carrier--all now well described, apparently, in sealed court records.
<P>        When we asked about AARP's advertisement of commercial products, we found that it 
repeatedly had been assessed penalties by the Postal Service for failing to pay the proper rates.  
When we asked about the purposes of federal grants to AARP, we found that the organization was 
providing "tax counseling" to senior citizens, while at the same time it was required to make a 
$135,000,000 payment in lieu of taxes to the IRS--for failure to adhere to our tax laws.  And the list 
went on, and on, and on.
<P>        I did not possess anything close to the resources necessary to get to the center of this 
labyrinth, and it is doubtful that anyone ever will.  I am told that the AARP is attempting to "turn 
over a new leaf," that it no longer wishes to be synonymous with ever-expanding government.  I 
certainly hope that is true.  During my hearings, the AARP was still claiming that its legislative 
stances were the product of careful consultation with its membership.  Yet at the same time, internal 
AARP polling data was showing us how the AARP was losing membership precisely because it 
was taking positions against balanced budgets and in favor of many massive new health care 
entitlements.  Those internal contradictions, I am told, are now being felt and fully addressed by the 
AARP itself.  In any event, let us hope that this is the case.
<P>        <I>Frightening Americas Elderly</I> provides a brief and valuable synopsis of the 
principal facts about the AARP and other seniors organizations.  As the possessor of a sizable stack 
of chaotic, random and disorganized material about the AARP, I commend Tom DiLorenzo and the 
Capital Research Center for condensing this serpentine tale into a direct and comprehensible tract.  
The reader will come away from this text knowing far more than even most AARP members do 
about the nature of that organization.
<P>        Our national motto is, "E pluribus unum"--"Out of many, one."  Our great strength as a 
nation has always been the openness and tolerance which has allowed us to transform a huge 
diversity of viewpoints into instruments of our great national interest.  But it is this forging of 
diversity into unity that is all-important.  When speaking to constituents, I am often compelled to 
remind them that "You are citizens first.  You are not Farm Bureau members first, or NEA 
members first, or journalists first, or NRA members first, or members of the AARP first.  You are 
citizens first!  Your first obligation is as a citizen of this nation, and every other membership is 
secondary."  
<P>        Too often in Washington, the voices we hear are the sum total of the special interests which 
have converged upon the nation's capital, drowning out the voice of the general interest of the 
American citizenry.  There are huge organizations devoted to protecting and defending the dollars 
being shipped to every imaginable organized constituency--and the more sympathetic the cause of 
the recipient, the easier the lobbying for it.  The elderly, the children, the middle class, the poor, the 
veterans--it seems there is no amount of money that Congress can spend on such groups that will 
grant it immunity from the charge of heartless cruelty to the downtrodden.
	We are now truly at a crossroads in American political history.  To continue to heed the hyperbolic, harsh and hyped rhetoric of one particular lobbying behemoth--the AARP--will spell mortal peril for the economic future of the nation.  The more we know 
mission, and structure, the better.  Accordingly, the descriptions that you are about to read are 
exceptionally important ones, and they provide critical knowledge relevant to any discussion about 
this country's budgetary priorities.  I trust that the gentle reader will find <I>Frightening Americas 
Elderly</I> most intriguing and informative!  Enjoy!

<P>
	If the Social Security and Medicare balance sheets were evaluated according to private-
sector accounting standards, both would be declared disastrously insolvent. -- Peter G. 
Peterson
<P>
<P>
<P>
	The "baby boomers"--the huge generation born between the late 1940s and mid-1960s--
have dominated America's commercial life for decades.  American business has long understood 
that the key to selling goods and services to this generation is to cater to its needs and preferences.  
The baby boomers have not only reshaped markets but have had a profound impact on our most 
enduring social and political institutions.
<P>        In the very near future, demographic trends will dictate that the interests and demands of 
baby boomers dominate government retirement and health policy, particularly Social Security and 
Medicare policy.  Together, Social Security and Medicare are the largest items in the federal 
budget: they account for about 34 percent of all federal expenditures and are projected to reach 39 
percent by 2005, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
<P>        Policymakers will have to face up to some unavoidable facts about the aging baby boomers 
and about the American population in general.  These realities will have a major impact on 
government retirement and health programs:
<UL>
	<LI> People are living longer.  In 1935, when the Social Security system was established, the 
average life expectancy was 61 years.  Today, it is 77 at birth and 82 if one reaches age 65.  Since 
the turn of the century, the number of Americans over 65 has increased almost elevenfold.  By 
contrast, the under-65 population only tripled during the last 100 years.  In 1900, one out of 25 
Americans was over 65; today the number is one in eight.  And the elderly population is expected 
to continue growing: a big jump will occur between 2005 and 2030 as the baby boomers reach 
retirement.  By 2025, as former U.S. Commerce Secretary Peter G. Peterson recently noted in the 
<I>Atlantic Monthly</I>, America will become "a nation of Floridas," with the proportion of all 
Americans who are elderly the same as the proportion of elderly in Florida today.
	<LI> In 1950, there were approximately 16 working-age Americans for every person over age 
65.  But by 2030, there will be just two working-age Americans for every person over 65.  Far 
fewer workers will have to support far more retirees if we continue to rely on the current Social 
Security and Medicare systems.
	<LI> The graying of America will increase demands on the health-care system, leading to much 
higher health-care costs if fundamental changes are not made to Social Security and Medicare.
	These trends, <I>Newsweek</I> recently noted, "doom Social Security and Medicare in 
their present form" because "the required tax burdens would be horrendous" and ultimately 
unacceptable to taxpayers.  With fewer taxpayers supporting more Social Security and Medicare 
recipients, either massive tax increases or significant benefit reductions will be necessary if these 
programs are left unchanged.  Peterson argues that if the system is not reformed, the cost of Social 
Security and Medicare by 2040 will take between 35 and 55 percent of every worker's paycheck 
"before we even start to pay for the rest of what government does.  Obviously, tax increases of this 
size would destroy the economy."  This kind of tax burden would also likely create 
"intergenerational warfare" as younger generations revolted against working half a year or more 
just to pay for the benefits of retirees.

<CENTER><H3>Fueling the Welfare State</H3></CENTER>
<P>
	In our book <I>Destroying Democracy: How Government Funds Partisan Politics</I>, 
economist James T. Bennett and I describe how the government uses thousands of tax-exempt 
nonprofit organizations to administer the myriad programs that comprise the welfare state.  These 
organizations receive on average about half their funding from government, and they form a 
"shadow government"--a virtual appendage of government--that lobbies incessantly for expanded 
welfare programs. Incredibly, much of this lobbying is funded either directly or indirectly with tax 
dollars.
<P>        The seniors lobby is typical of this phenomenon.  The American Association of Retired 
Persons (AARP), the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC), the Gray Panthers, and dozens 
of lesser-known organizations were created over the last few decades to ostensibly represent the 
concerns and interests of senior citizens.  But as this study will show, the so-called seniors lobby is, 
for the most part, a coalition of self-appointed activists favoring more government, more regulation, 
and higher taxes--all of which would increase seniors' dependence on government.  A vastly 
expanded government is not in the best interests of the elderly, but it <I>is</I> in the best financial 
and political interests of the seniors lobby.
<P>        This study describes how organizations comprising the seniors lobby promote costly and 
inefficient government programs, mandates, and regulations which they claim are the best way to 
meet the needs of seniors.  Their push for more government continues despite the worldwide 
failures of socialism and the welfare state.  Even democratic countries that have recently elected 
socialist governments--New Zealand is a notable example--are privatizing industries, cutting taxes, 
and discarding many once-sacrosanct welfare programs.  Other countries have abandoned 
government-run insurance programs and are developing creative alternatives that rely on free-
market competition and consumer choice to provide for the elderly.  Their policies, whose features 
can serve as models for U.S. reforms, are described in chapter six.
<P>        Reform-minded policymakers in the U.S. face powerful political opposition from the 
seniors lobby.  As James Bennett and I have shown in <I>Destroying Democracy</I>, entrenched 
special interests whose economic livelihood is tied to the continued expansion of failed welfare-
state programs are stalling innovative changes that are succeeding around the world.  These special 
interests have found it advantageous to organize themselves as tax-exempt, tax-deductible--and 
increasingly taxpayer-funded--nonprofit organizations.
<P>        This is the case with AARP, NCSC, and other seniors groups that have long been part of the 
Washington welfare establishment.  They devote enormous resources to fending off any efforts to 
fundamentally reform Social Security, Medicare, and other government programs.  Ignoring the 
consequences to future retirees, they seek to convince seniors and the public that these programs are 
financially sound and that any problems can be fixed by minor adjustments and tax increases.
<P>        Some of Social Security's most committed supporters have been honest enough to admit 
that it is essentially a Ponzi scheme.  They argue only that it is a darn good one!  Paul Samuelson, a 
Nobel laureate economist at MIT, argued back in 1967 that the "beauty" of Social Security is that 
"everyone who reaches retirement age is given benefit privileges that far exceed anything he has 
paid in [because] the national product is growing at compound interest and can be expected to do so 
for as far ahead as the eye cannot [<I>sic</I>] see. . . .  A <I>growing nation is the greatest Ponzi 
scheme ever contrived</I>" (emphasis added).6
<P>        Charles Ponzi, it should be recalled, was a finance and land speculator who in the 1920s 
gave investors the assurance that inexhaustible supplies of new money from future investors would 
guarantee high rates of return on earlier loans and purchases.  Of course, it all came tumbling down. 
<P> It may have appeared likely to Samuelson in 1967 that Social Security could also continue "as far 
ahead as the eye cannot see."  But America's population trends have changed everything: the annual 
report of the Social Security Trust Fund now projects that the system will be bankrupt by 2029 if it 
remains on its current path.  Medicare is on the same precarious financial course, and is projected to 
go bankrupt much earlier.
<P>        But none of this seems to matter to the seniors lobby.  Claiming that their own interests 
reflect the interests of tens of millions of seniors, organizations like AARP are quick to oppose 
policymakers who seek fundamental reform of programs for the aged.  They try to lull working-age 
Americans into complacency about the impending bankruptcy of Social Security and Medicare 
while frightening the elderly about constructive efforts to resolve the crisis.
<P>

<P>
	This study describes the agendas, activities, and funding of organizations that comprise the 
seniors lobby and analyzes the social and economic implications of their policy positions.  It 
focuses mostly on the activities of the larger and more established seniors groups since they are the 
most influential.
<P>        Chapter two focuses on the American Association of Retired Persons, specifically, the 
business practices of its $191,000,000-a-year money machine.  It questions whether any of AARP's 
commercial activities, from selling insurance to mutual funds, is appropriate for an organization 
that claims to be a charity.  Does Congress turn a blind eye to AARP's tax-exempt commercial 
businesses because AARP has powerful political ties and clout?
<P>        Chapter three also examines AARP, focusing on its tax-funded political agenda.  It 
describes how AARP lobbied for the failed Clinton health plan as well as for the catastrophic 
health-care plan that Congress enacted in 1989 and later repealed.  It also discusses AARP's efforts 
to dramatically raise taxes, increase government spending, and expand government programs that 
are demonstrably harmful.
<P>        Chapter four provides an overview of the activities and funding of the second most 
politically powerful seniors organization, the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC).  
Founded by the Democratic National Committee and AFL-CIO, NCSC received about 96 percent 
of its funding in 1993 from federal tax revenues.  It is less a seniors organization than a labor-union 
front whose political agenda mirrors that of the AFL-CIO--even when that agenda is odds with the 
best interests of most seniors.
<P>        Chapter five reviews the activities and funding of other prominent seniors organizations, 
including the National Council on the Aging, Families U.S.A., National Committee to Preserve 
Social Security and Medicare, Save Our Security Coalition, Older Women's League, and Gray 
Panthers.  These organizations share a dedication to tieing the well-being of seniors to an 
increasingly powerful federal government.
<P>        Not all seniors organizations promote welfare-state dependency for the elderly.  Chapter six 
discusses three groups--The Seniors Coalition, United Seniors Association, and the 60 Plus 
Association--that promote policies based on individual responsibility, consumer choice, free-market 
competition, and limited constitutional government as the best means for meeting the needs of 
seniors.  These organizations understand the seriousness of the financial problems facing Social 
Security and Medicare, and they are developing policy ideas that will guarantee benefits to current 
retirees while reducing the burden on younger generations.  Chapter six also examines the 
promising old-age insurance systems in Chile and Singapore and their implications for the U.S.
<P>        The graying of the baby boom generation will place unprecedented stress on both Social 
Security and Medicare.  As we stand on the threshold of the 21st century, we know that socialism 
and the welfare state have been colossal failures.  It is imperative that public policy for the aged be 
redesigned with this reality in mind.
<P>        Unfortunately, Washington, D.C.-based seniors organizations are defenders of the failed 
Great Society.  They have become a major stumbling block to reform.  If this study can persuade 
more Americans to question the failed ideologies that continue to govern public policy for the aged-
-policies that, if left unchallenged, will spoil the retirement years of the graying baby boomers--it 
will have achieved its purpose.

<a name="intro"></a><h3> Introduction</h3>
<P>
 Concern for the natural environment is an American tradition
with a long and proud history.  The Americans who created modern
industrial society and populated its urban centers in the late
19th and early 20th centuries also established national conservation
organizations.  Because they wanted to retain and enjoy the resources
of nature and pass them on to later generations, they organized
the National Wildlife Federation,
the National Audubon Society and
the Izaak Walton League of America,
and worked with local conservation groups to protect habitat and
maintain the amenities of environmental beauty and recreation.
<P>
 In 1970, millions of Americans celebrated the first Earth
Day.  This event mobilized thousands of activists and spawned
a new generation of environmental groups: The Natural
Resources Defense Council, the Environmental
Defense Fund, Environmental Action,
and the Environmental Policy
Institute were among the new advocacy groups that joined the older
resource conservation and wilderness preservation organizations.
 These groups, however, wanted to impose on the United States
a new philosophy of environmental protection.  They believed the
federal government should exercise primary responsibility for
solving environmental problems, and they aggressively promoted
an agenda of national public policies.  Their ideas were rapidly
adopted by the old-line conservation groups.  A new and powerful
political force was born.
<P>
 The new environmental movement provoked a flurry of legislative
activity.  The National
Environmental Policy Act was signed into law on January 1, 1970.
 Congress then passed the Clean Air
Act (1970), the Clean Water Act
(1972), the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (1972), the Endangered
Species Act (1973), and the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (1976), among many others.  More
laws followed.  By the end of the 1980s, environmental bills accounted
for nearly one-fifth of bills presented to Congress
and almost one-quarter of those enacted into law.
<P>
 The Reagan Administration
has been portrayed as opposed to environmental legislation, but
President Reagan signed laws like
the 1984 amendments to the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, which gave the federal government
&quot;cradle-to-grave&quot; authority over waste management. 
The Reagan Administration also dramatically increased environmental
enforcement.  For instance, between 1983 and 1989 the Justice
Department more than tripled the amount of fines levied against
those found guilty of &quot;environmental crimes.&quot;
<P>
 George Bush rapidly accelerated
the process.  He pledged to be the &quot;environmental president&quot;
and introduced and signed into law the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990, which regulates actual and potential
sources of air pollution from factories and autos to lawnmowers
and grain silos.  It is the nation's most costly environmental
legislation.  His Administration presided over an explosion in
environmental rulemaking--<I>National
Journal</I> labelled Bush the &quot;regulatory president&quot;--as
well as substantial increases in environment-related spending
and federal land acquisition.<BR>

<P><a name="what"></a>
<B>WHAT PRICE ENVIRONMENTALISM?</B>
<P>
 The government's environmental activism has been costly.  The
Environmental Protection
Agency has estimated that Americans spend well over $150 billion
per year complying with environmental regulations--over two percent
of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
 Local governments must comply with nearly 175 unfunded federal
mandates and have to test drinking water for over 100 separate
substances.  Under one hypothesis of risk and cost,
the Office of Management
and Budget has estimated that one waste disposal regulation--a
listing of certain wood-treating chemicals as hazardous wastes--imposes
costs of $5.7 <I>trillion</I> to avert one premature cancer death.
<P>
 When businesses try to absorb the costs of complying with complex
environmental rules and permits, they are likely to pass on the
cost to consumers by raising the price of their products.  And
when they are confronted by the uncertainties of statutory interpretation
and the regulatory enforcement of environmental law they may decide
to slow the development and application of new technologies.
<P>
 Environmental regulation is increasingly expensive and, many
argue, less effective in achieving its goals, particularly in
the area of risk reduction.  Dr. William Cooper,
an ecologist at Michigan State
University, observes: &quot;We're really just about at the end
of the reductions in risk that you can achieve by the conventional
approach, which is to crank down on the pollution coming out of
the end of the pipe.  Now we're into more subtle issues.  How
clean do we really want our environment?  How much are we really
willing to pay for it?&quot;
<P>
 Nor are the regulatory trade-offs only ones of cost against benefit.
 It is also increasingly clear that attempting to improve environmental
quality in one area can hurt the environment in other areas. 
For example, EPA regulations
require the incineration of certain dioxin-contaminated wastes.
 Yet an incinerator that cannot meet the EPA's destruction standard
for dioxin may produce two barrels of dioxin-contaminated ash
for every barrel of dioxin-contaminated waste that it burns. 
Under current federal law, this ash cannot be put in a landfill.
 <I>The </I><I>New York Times</I> revealed
that ash of this kind from an incinerator at an abandoned Arkansas
chemical factory had to be stored in perpetuity in a $300,000
facility built for that purpose.  The total cost of that single
&quot;cleanup&quot; operation was over $25 million and could reach
up to $175 million.
<P>
 Or consider the Endangered
Species Act (ESA).  Under the Act, landowners lose the right to
use their land as they see fit when an endangered animal is discovered
on it.  Landowners cannot build or enlarge their homes, plant
crops, or cut down trees.  Rather than protect wildlife, the ESA
punishes landowners, in effect, for creating or maintaining a
species habitat.  The Act creates disincentives for protecting
endangered species.  Michael Bean of the
Environmental Defense Fund (EDF)
observes that landowners who find an endangered species on their
property may well decide to destroy it and its habitat before
it is discovered by federal authorities--a process
some call &quot;shoot, shovel, and shut up.&quot;  Nonetheless,
EDF and most other environmental groups remain steadfast supporters
of the ESA.<BR>

<P><a name="media"></a>
<B>MEDIA SKEPTICISM</B>
<P>
 The late journalist Warren Brookes was
among the first writers to expose the economic ignorance of environmental
policymakers and challenge their misuse of science.  His example
has been followed by writers for <I>Forbes</I>,
<I>The </I><I>Washington Times</I> and
the <I>Detroit News</I>, among other publications.
 Conservative and libertarian publications like <I>Reason,
</I><I>Insight, </I><I>Human
Events</I>, and <I>National Review</I>
also have focused attention on the failings of conventional environmental
analysis.  More recently, the major media have begun to look skeptically
at the claims of environmentalism.
<P>
<ul>
 <li>In December 1990, the popular
CBS News program &quot;60
Minutes&quot; aired a story which concluded that acid rain posed
little environmental threat.  The program quoted scientists who
refused to justify the $4 to $7 billion cost of an acid rain control
program that Congress had passed earlier
in the year.
<P>
 <li>In March 1993, the <I>New
York Times</I> published &quot;What Price Cleanup?&quot; a five-part
series that asserted &quot;many scientists, economists and Government
officials have reached the dismaying conclusion that much of America's
environmental program has gone seriously awry&quot; because &quot;environmental
policy has too often evolved largely in reaction to popular panics,
not in response to sound scientific analyses of which environmental
hazards pose the greatest risks.&quot;  The series challenged
the Superfund program, the reliability of animal
tests to assess chemical risk, and the need for a ban on ocean
dumping, among other policies.
<P>
 <li> In November 1993, ABC
News' &quot;20/20&quot; documented how enforcement of the Endangered
Species Act devastated some Riverside County, California homeowners.
 To protect the endangered Stephens'
Kangaroo Rat, homeowners were forbidden to clear firebreaks around
their homes.  When fires swept through the county in 1993, 29
homes (and rat habitat) were lost.
<P>
 <li>In December 1993, <I>U.S.
News &amp; World Report</I> published an in-depth look at &quot;The
Doomsday Myths&quot;--fear of species extinction and overpopulation.
 The story's conclusion: &quot;Environmentalists' penchant for
doomsaying is coming back to haunt them.&quot;
<P>
 <li>In April 1994, a highly-rated
ABC
News special  &quot;Are We Scaring Ourselves to Death?&quot; showed
how the federal Superfund program actually <I>increased</I> the
risk to public health and safety.  An abandoned Colorado silver
mine called Smuggler Mountain was designated
a federal Superfund site in 1986.  Though there
was no evidence that local residents were in danger, the federal
cleanup plan called for the physical dislocation of 150 homes
so that four feet of dirt could be removed from the site.  Local
leaders opposed the EPA plan, and one doctor told ABC, &quot;If
you want to save lives in this valley, build us a new road.  Our
road is what kills people.&quot;
<P>
 <li>In September 1994, the <I>Los
Angeles Times</I> ran a three-part series, &quot;Living Scared:
Why Do the Media Make Life Seem So Risky?&quot; on the &quot;cry-wolf&quot;
stories that dominate media coverage of the environment.  The
series' headline declared &quot;We're safer and healthier than
ever--and also more afraid of what we eat, drink and breathe.
 Why the reality gap?  Too often, critics say, the media's coverage
fuels our fears.&quot;
<P>
</ul>
 These stories criticize failed government environmental policies
and the nonprofit lobbying organizations that helped put them
in place.  NRDC senior
attorney David Hawkins said as much on &quot;60
Minutes&quot;: &quot;The environmental community has spent almost
no effort attempting to even monitor the progress&quot; of government-sponsored
acid rain research.  Instead, &quot;we have been working on trying
to get legislation in Washington.&quot;
<P>
 Public dissatisfaction with &quot;regulate first, ask questions
later&quot; policies is growing.  In 1991, only 28 percent of
the American public thought environmental groups exaggerated threats
&quot;in order to get the public to pay attention to them.&quot;
 By 1994, the number was 42 percent.
<P>
 Yet although many policy experts and the public now recognize
the failings of much environmental policy, Washington's environmental
lobbies are unyielding.  &quot;We don't need a new paradigm&quot;
said David Doniger, a senior attorney at the Natural
Resources Defense Council who later joined the Clinton
White House.  Fifteen environmental groups that participated
in a joint fundraising appeal opposed any efforts to reform existing
environmental laws and called instead for their strengthening.
 Leaders of the groups typically have attributed public dissatisfaction
to bad publicity and poor public education, not inadequacies in
policy.  &quot;Our business is basically communications and we've
lost the imagination of the guy on the street,&quot; says Ted
Lee Eubanks of the National
Audubon Society.
<P>
 The <I>New York Times</I> series, &quot;What
Price Cleanup?&quot;, was particularly threatening to environmentalists.
 Keith Schneider, the lead author of the
series, was called a mouthpiece for polluting corporations in
a September 1993 article in <I>Sierra</I>, the magazine
of the Sierra Club.  An official
of the Hudson County Sierra
Club earlier published similar charges, as had former Greenpeace
analyst Peter Montague, founder and director
of the Environmental
Research Foundation.  One year later, the National
Wildlife Federation published &quot;The Truth About Dioxin&quot;
in the pages of <I>National Wildlife</I>.
 It too charged Schneider with inaccuracy, but provided little
substantive documentation.
<P>
 These stories side-stepped Schneider's main point--that environmental
regulations cost a lot and produce little.  Instead, they targeted
Schneider's sources--corporate executives or scientists who received
corporate research funding--and the alleged interest of corporations
like the <I>Times</I> in underplaying the risks of dioxin and
other chemicals.  Schneider replied in his own defense: &quot;By
trying to portray others as enemies, and by failing to understand
the cultural shifts in understanding in the U.S., the national
environmentalists have become an enemy of the very programs, policies
and laws they themselves espouse.&quot;<BR>
</SUP>
<P><a name="env"></a>
<B>ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN THE POLLING BOOTH</B>
<P>
 The election returns of 1994 are one gauge of public attitudes.
 Polls show that voters support strong environmental protection,
but they also elect candidates who campaign for regulatory reform.
<P>
<ul>
 <li>The Endangered
Species Act was a central issue in the Texas Governor's race between
incumbent Ann Richards and challenger
George W. Bush, Jr.  Two Bush radio
ads attacked Richards for not working hard enough to protect property
owners' rights.  Attempting to save Richards from defeat, the <!--Clinton (Bill) Administration,-->Clinton
Administration announced that it would not restrict development
in central Texas to protect habitat for the golden-cheeked warbler.
<P>
 <li>In Pennsylvania, successful gubernatorial
candidate Tom Ridge campaigned against
costly federal air pollution control mandates on the state that
included more stringent new car emission standards and a requirement
that automakers sell electric cars.
<P>
 <li>In Oklahoma, Representative Mike
Synar was defeated in the Democratic primary
&quot;in part because of his steadfast support for tougher rules
on a range of environmental issues.&quot;  Other
environmental allies, including Representatives Dan Hamburg
(D-CA), Dan Glickman (D-KS), Karen Shepard
(D-UT), Tom Andrews (D-ME), Karan English
(D-AZ) and Senator Jim Sasser (D-TN) also
lost their seats.  Of 15 legislators whose reelection was a priority
for the League of Conservation
Voters, seven lost.
<P>
 <li>New freshmen were elected on
platforms to reform or repeal laws like the Endangered
Species and Clean Water Acts. 
They include Republicans Ed Brant of Tennessee,
Helen Chenoweth of Idaho, Wes Cooley
of Ohio, John Shadegg of Arizona, Linda
Smith of Washington, and William &quot;Mac&quot;
Thornberry of
Texas.  Indiana voters elected David McIntosh,
the former executive director of Vice President Dan Quayle's
Council on Competitiveness,
an agency that infuriated environmental lobbyists with its deregulatory
initiatives.<BR>
</ul>
<P><a name="unholy"></a>
<B>THE &quot;UNHOLY TRINITY&quot;</B>
<P>
 Dissatisfaction with much current government environmental regulation
centers on three issues--risk assessment, unfunded mandates, and
property rights.  They have been dubbed the &quot;unholy trinity&quot;
or the &quot;triple threat&quot; by environmental lobbyists. 
Environmental groups consider them the greatest threat to their
legislative and regulatory agendas, short of wholesale budget
cuts or the repudiation of government regulation as an environmental
protection strategy.
<P>
<ul>
<li><I>Risk
Assessment</I>--The premise underlying much federal environmental
regulation is that people's lives can be made safer by eliminating
or reducing human exposure to any number of dangerous substances--from
industrial air emissions to household chemicals.  But instead
of focusing on genuine, i.e., scientifically demonstrable, threats
to public health and safety,  the regulatory process often targets
risks that the public fears most or that have public relations
or political value.  Federal agencies spend millions
of dollars that do comparatively little to improve public health
and environmental quality.  According to analysts at Harvard's
School of Public Health, the cost-per-life-saved of the average
EPA regulation--over $7.5
million--is 87 times higher than the cost-per-life-saved of an
average regulation issued by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration.  Moreover, some
federal regulations make the questionable scientific assumption
that any dose of a substance found to be toxic in certain dosages
and under certain conditions must therefore always be considered
dangerous to human health.  But a central principle of toxicology
is &quot;the dose makes the poison.&quot;
<P>
 Critics of agencies like EPA
are demanding more openness about the methods used to draft environmental
regulations.  They say that decisionmaking would improve if agencies
had to rely on peer-reviewed science and conducted cost-benefit
analysis of proposed regulations.  &quot;Such analysis permits
comparison of various options, all of which may be beneficial
in some way, but not all of which can be simultaneously taken,&quot;
explains environmental analyst Kent Jeffreys.
<P>
 Some environmentalists agree in principle.  According to former
National Audubon Society president
Peter Berle, &quot;Clearly it is a useful
way of establishing priorities.  We've got to ask ourselves whether
[policies] make sense from a cost point of view.&quot;
 Nonetheless, all major environmental groups formally oppose requiring
agencies to perform risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses
on the grounds that such analyses are &quot;pseudo-scientific.&quot;
<P>
 <li><I>Unfunded
Mandates</I>--Congress creates an &quot;unfunded mandate&quot;
when it passes a law that requires state or local governments
to meet goals or create programs, but fails to provide the money
for its implementation.  Under pressure to reduce the federal
deficit, Congress has increasingly relied
on them to meet environmental goals.
<P>
 State and local officials naturally oppose unfunded mandates
because their local priorities must be subordinated to Washington's
dictates.  Currently, it is estimated that up to 12 percent of
municipal revenues are spent to comply with unfunded mandates
of all sorts.  Local concerns are well-articulated by Michael
J. Pompilli, head of the environmental
health division of the Columbus, Ohio,
Health Department: &quot;What bothers me is that the new rules
coming out of Washington are taking money from decent programs
and making me waste them on less important problems.  It kills
you as a city official to see this kind of money spent for nothing.&quot;
<P>
 <li><I>Property
Rights</I>--Many environmental regulations override private land-use
decisions.  For example, the Fish
&amp; Wildlife Service will routinely deny property owners use
of their land if endangered species are present.  Policies to
protect wetlands and scenic rivers also supersede private property
rights.
<P>
 Many landowners say these policies violate the &quot;takings
clause&quot; of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution, which states &quot;. . . nor shall private property
be taken for public use without just compensation.&quot;  Property
rights advocates would reinvigorate this provision of the Bill
of Rights.  If the public wants to protect endangered species
or preserve a scenic vista, they say the public should be willing
to pay for it, just as it pays for highways, military bases, parks,
and other &quot;public goods.&quot;
<P>
</ul>
 Washington environmental lobbyists steadfastly oppose risk assessment,
relief from unfunded mandates, and greater protection of property.
 Thus, the Natural Resources
Defense Council announced that opposing such proposals would be
its &quot;single most important environmental campaign ever.&quot;
 The Sierra Club's executive director calls
these three issues &quot;pure and simple, an overt and calculated
attack on the environment,&quot; and &quot;an assault on the guiding
principle of virtually all laws governing air, water, and waste
disposal.&quot;  Most Americans, however, do not
appear to agree.  Indeed, many support these reforms while strongly
favoring environmental protection.  To most Americans, the two
are not incompatible.

<P><a name="envi"></a>
<B>ENVIRONMENTAL BACKLASH AND THE 103RD CONGRESS</B>
<P>
 The extent of the backlash against environmentalists can be seen
in the record of the 103rd Congress (1993-1994).  As environmentalists
see it, that Congress was an unmitigated
disaster.  The League of
Conservation Voters rated it the worst in 25 years.  Although
environmental lobbyists expected much from a Democratic President
and Congress, only one notable bill was signed into law, the California
Desert Protection Act.  Despite environmentalist cries of urgency,
Congress was unable to reauthorize several expired environmental
laws.
<P>
 Partisan gridlock is how pundits have explained Congressional
inaction: Republicans and conservative Democrats from the South
and West blocked good bills to placate industry lobbyists or for
partisan advantage.  EPA
Administrator Carol Browner told journalists,
&quot;What we've run into is gridlock and obstructionism that
is truly unprecedented.&quot;
<P>
 This argument may work in other areas, but not for environmental
legislation.  Little was attempted on the House
or Senate floor that culminated in gridlock.
 Rather, back room agreements were reached between influential
liberal legislators and the representatives of Washington's largest
environmental groups that doomed passage of the reauthorization
bills that environmentalists claimed they wanted.
<P>
 In February 1994, the representatives of six major environmental
groups--the Natural Resources
Defense Council, the Sierra Club, the National
Audubon Society, the National
Wildlife Federation, the Friends of
the Earth, and the Environmental
Defense Fund--met with California Democratic Representatives George
Miller, then-chairman of the House
Natural Resources Committee, and Henry Waxman,
then-chairman of the Environment
subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to discuss
legislative strategy.  Because they anticipated that serious efforts
would be made to attach &quot;unholy trinity&quot; amendments
to upcoming environmental legislation, the lobbyists decided it
was better to hold off on consideration of any important environmental
bills.  They thought they had the strength to stop bills from
moving, but not enough to defeat the hostile amendments.  As Jim
Maddy, former president of the League
of Conservation Voters later explained, &quot;The best we can
do is prevent Congress from weakening the Clean
Water Act, prevent this Congress from weakening Superfund,
prevent this Congress from weakening the Safe
Drinking Water Act and prevent this Congress from weakening the
Endangered Species Act.&quot;
<P>
 This decision was documented in an extremely controversial memo
leaked on Capitol Hill in March 1994.  Written by
the NRDC's chief lobbyist,
Erik Olson, the memo outlined &quot;the legislative
agenda for this Congress&quot; on environmental issues as determined
at the lobbyists' meeting with Miller and Waxman.  The memo explained
that &quot;kill strategies&quot; were to be adopted for environmental
legislation that was susceptible to amendments of the kind that
the memo labeled &quot;unholy trinity.&quot;  Reauthorization
of the nation's solid waste law--the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA--and the Endangered
Species Act were to be &quot;taken off the table.&quot;  A &quot;kill
strategy&quot; was also intended for the reauthorization of the
Clean Water Act.  National
Audubon Society vice president Brock Evans
later described the strategy: &quot;We are slowing down on some
of our agenda because it is just too risky to reauthorize the
<!--Endangered Species Act of 1973,-->Endangered Species Act,
for example, with all these amendments locked into it.&quot;
<P>
 The only bill the group decided to allow on the floor was the
reauthorization of the Safe Drinking
Water Act.  Because it applies primarily to municipal water systems,
the lobbyists presumed it would attract less industry interest
and would more easily be kept free of reform amendments.  Yet
Olson and the others did not appreciate the
extent of opposition to their agenda.  They did not realize that
their primary opponent was no longer industry.  As one Senate
staffer explained, the &quot;primary adversary on many of these
issues isn't the National
Association of Manufacturers--it's the National
Governors' Association.&quot;
<P>
 As a result of the miscalculation the strategy failed.  The Senate
approved hostile unholy trinity amendments and proceeded to pass
the Safe Drinking Water Act reauthorization
by a large margin.  Even though a &quot;clean&quot; bill emerged
from the House, environmental
lobbyists recognized that an agreement with the Senate to strip
the offending provisions could not be reached and opted to let
the bill die before a House-Senate conference rather than allow
it to be enacted into law.  Thus even a relatively non-controversial
bill--it passed by wide majorities in both Houses of Congress--was
killed by environmental lobbyists opposed to the &quot;unholy
trinity.&quot;
<P>
 Environmental lobbyists have blamed this and other failures on
special interest groups who &quot;profit from pollution and from
exploiting public lands and resources.&quot;  A joint letter,
characterized as a &quot;Fourth of July 'wakeup call',&quot; was
signed by fifteen environmental lobbying organizations.  They
charged that &quot;At every turn, members of Congress are getting
more pressure from those who want to weaken environmental laws
than from those who want to strengthen them.&quot;
 The letter, sent to 400,000 people on the mailing lists of the
participating groups, was meant to revive grass roots activism
and offered a &quot;citizen action guide&quot; with counter-arguments
on &quot;unholy trinity&quot; issues.  One House aide explained
the approach, &quot;Without local-level support, there's no reason
for congressional moderates to vote with the environment.&quot;
<P>
 Neither lack of effort nor misallocation of resources explains
why the environmental movement failed to pass its legislative
agenda.  Rather, the leaders of environmental groups misunderstood
public sentiment.  Looking at polling data showing broad support
for environmental protection, they assumed the public must support
the agenda of the National
Wildlife Federation, the Sierra Club and the
League of Conservation Voters.
 But the same polls often show public support for reforms such
as the compensation of property owners for the adverse impact
of land-use regulations intended to protect wetlands or endangered
species.
<P>
 Environmentalists do not see that the public's interest in economic
common sense and fairness is compatible with support for a clean
environment.  Senate
Environment Committee staffer Michael Evans
tried explaining this at a seminar organized by the League
of Conservation Voters: &quot;Each of [the &quot;unholy trinity&quot;]
issues embodies a core truth.  It's important for you to concede
the truth, embrace it.  That's what's happening on the other side.
 They concede the principle of environmental protection, and they
talk about the need to prioritize resources.&quot;<BR>

<P><a name="increasing"></a>
<B>INCREASING PUBLIC DISSATISFACTION</B>
<P>
 Environmentalism's political failures coincide with a decline
in public support for Washington's environmental establishment.
 Since 1990, the ten largest environmental groups have lost members
and their annual revenues have been stagnant.  After a decade
of tremendous expansion, the ten largest groups--Ducks
Unlimited, the Environmental
Defense Fund, Greenpeace, Inc., the National
Audubon Society, the National
Parks and Conservation Association, the National
Wildlife Federation, the Sierra Club, the Nature
Conservancy, the Wilderness Society,
and the World Wildlife Fund--saw their
collective membership drop 6.5 percent from 1990 to 1993.
 &quot;It was easy for environmental groups to raise money&quot;
in the 1970s and 1980s, explains Dan <!--Borochoff, Dan,-->Borochoff
of the <!--American Institute of Philanthropy,-->American Institute
of Philanthropy, &quot;Now they're having to justify themselves
more.&quot;
<P>
 Worse, the problems are not just financial.  &quot;The green
groups also are faced with widespread cynicism about institutions
in general&quot; and public distrust of Washington, D.C.
 When Cindy Gabriel learned that former
National Wildlife Federation
president Jay Hair,  earned over $230,000 per year,
she told <I>The </I><I>Wall Street
Journal</I> she probably would quit the organization.
 If she saw the salaries of the other environmental C.E.O.s, Ms.
Gabriel might never contribute again to a national environmental
lobbying group.  Many environmental leaders are paid like high-powered
inside-the-beltway lobbyists, which is what they have become:
<P>
 <ul>
<li> Jay D. Hair
(former president), National
Wildlife Federation ($242,060);
<P>
<li>Fred Krupp,
Environmental Defense Fund ($213,504);
<P>
 <li> Kathryn Fuller,
<!--World Wildlife Fund,-->World Wildlife Fund ($185,000);
<P>
<li> Peter A.A. Berle
(former president), National Audubon
Society ($171,154);
<P>
<li> Karin Sheldon,
Wilderness Society ($90,896);
<P>
<li> Carl Pope,
Sierra Club ($77,142);
<P>
<li> Barbara Dudley,
Greenpeace ($65,000).
</ul>
<P>
 Left-liberal critics like writers for <I>The </I><I>Nation</I>
take particular exception: &quot;The mainstream high brass is
elitist, highly paid, detached from the people, indifferent to
the working class and a firm ally of big government.&quot;
 A recent controversy inside the Sierra Club
about logging in the Northern Rockies is illustrative.  Local
chapters in Montana and other states have called for an end to
logging on federal lands there.  But the Sierra Club's national
leadership has opposed such a blanket policy, and responded by
threatening to depose local elected officials.  &quot;What we
are seeing here is how an environmental organization becomes a
bureaucracy,&quot; said Andy Mahler, a Sierra
Club member in Indiana.  &quot;The higher up in the organization
you go, the impulse is to protect each other, to protect funding,
to protect political access rather than take a stand.&quot;
<P>
 A study from the Center
for the Study of American Business confirms the suspicion that
environmental organizations have become more bureaucratic over
the past two decades.  Authors Christopher Boerner
and Jennifer Chilton Kallery
find that staffs at the major groups have skyrocketed since 1970.
 The most rapid growth occurred in the 1980s, with many employees
working in fundraising and membership development.  Some groups
may devote as much as 25 percent of revenues to fundraising and
20 percent more to membership development.  &quot;Such hefty investments
in promotion and development by [some] environmental groups have
almost certainly been primary contributors to their growth over
the last fifteen years,&quot; they note.
<P>
 Dave Foreman, a former Wilderness
Society lobbyist and founder of Earth First!
and The Wildlands Project speaks with
characteristic fervor:<BR>

<P>
<blockquote> As in most business, government, and citizen organizations,
the technicians--accountants, lawyers, public-relations-experts,
and political pros--have taken over from the idealists. . . .
 Political operatives, not conservationists, are sought for jobs
with environmental groups. . . .  A salaried elite has formed
that elevates itself above the volunteers.
</blockquote>
<P>
 This concern is summed up by Bill Gifford
and the editors of <I>Outside</I> magazine: &quot;If
only some of the larger groups didn't have vast bureaucracies,
publicity machines, and presidents like the National
Wildlife Federation's Jay Hair, who is accustomed
to being squired about by a chauffeur.&quot;
<P>
 When the <I>Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>
polled attitudes toward charity it found that no environmental
organization made the public's list of the twenty &quot;Best Liked&quot;
or &quot;Most Credible&quot; charitable causes.
But the twenty &quot;Most Opposed&quot; groups included Greenpeace
(6th), the Sierra Club (12th), and the Environmental
Defense Fund (20th).  Among the twenty &quot;Least Credible&quot;
were the same three organizations--7th, 14th, and 18th--and Friends
of the Earth Foundation (19th).  Greenpeace,
the National Audubon Society and
the Sierra Club were also on the list of top
twenty &quot;never donated to&quot; charitable causes.  Similarly,
a poll conducted by <!--American Forests,--><I>American Forests</I>
found that in the northwestern United States environmentalists
are less trusted than timber industry scientists.
<P>
 Changing public attitudes toward environmental lobbyists hurts
some groups more than others.  Four groups have been hit hard
by falling memberships and revenues: the Sierra
Club, the National Audubon Society,
the Wilderness Society, and Greenpeace.
<P>
<ul>
<li> <I>Sierra
Club</I>--From 1990 to 1993, membership fell from almost 630,000
to 500,000.  In one year, 1992-1993, membership dropped
15 percent.  Sierra has accumulated deficits of almost
$3 million since 1990.  The Sierra Club recently announced plans
to reduce its coverage of policy issues.  In 1995, it will focus
on pollution prevention and scenic preservation, and drop work
on population issues, energy conservation and other issues.  The
Club plans to cut its budget by $3.7 million and lay off 350 employees.
 As Sierra Club executive director Carl <!--Pope, Carl,-->Pope
explained, &quot;We had been spending our reserves but no longer
felt this was prudent.&quot;
<P>
<li><I>National
Audubon Society</I>--Membership dropped by 8 percent from 1992
to 1993, and donations also slipped slightly.  Membership
growth has waned since Audubon refashioned its image as an activist
group.  In 1993, it ran a $1.7 million deficit. 
Audubon officials hope to balance their budget by 1996.
<P>
<li><I>Wilderness
Society</I>--Membership plummeted by nearly a third between 1990
and 1993 and finances dropped by $2.9 million--almost
one-sixth.  Field offices were closed in Oregon,
Utah, and Maine.  Society staffers &quot;now must plunk down a
quarter for office coffee.&quot;
<P>
<li><I>Greenpeace</I>--In
1990, Greenpeace had approximately 2.5 million members, but membership
has dropped by 800,000.  Greenpeace's funding dropped
by nearly a third in 1991.  Revenues for Greenpeace
dropped by nearly 10 percent more between 1992 and 1993,
forcing the group to lay off 100 staff members.  Explains Greenpeace's
development director, David <!--Lemos, David,-->Lemos, &quot;We
had gotten used to having a lot more money.&quot;
</ul>
<P>
 Not all environmental groups have done poorly in the 1990s. 
The Environmental Defense Fund
(EDF) had increases in membership (25 percent) and revenues (6
percent) between 1992 and 1993.  The World
Wildlife Fund (WWF) lost 7 percent of its members during the period,
but revenues increased 10 percent.  Donations may
not be dramatically increasing at the Nature
Conservancy (TNC), but <I>Outside</I> magazine
characterizes its finances as &quot;cash-flow heaven.&quot;
<P>
 EDF, WWF and TNC benefit from perceptions of them as more conservative
than other environmental advocacy organizations.  Bush EPA chief
William Reilly was tapped from the ranks
of WWF, and the Administration's 1990 Clean
Air Act proposal borrowed heavily from the work of EDF.  Unlike
most environmental groups, TNC eschews high-profile lobbying campaigns.
 To promote conservation, it directs most of its resources towards
the purchase of lands and easements.
<P>
 Still, the fortunes of environmental groups may be tied, at least
in part, to the health of the economy.  Charitable giving tends
to increase in times of economic prosperity.  &quot;Giving by
individuals and corporations jumped dramatically in the 1980s&quot;
explains economist Richard B. McKenzie.
 Private charitable giving, which increased by less than 3.5 percent
per year from 1955 to 1980, increased over 5.1 percent annually
during the 1980s, from $77.5 billion in 1980 to over $120 billion
in 1989.  When the economy slowed in 1989, the rise in charitable
giving came to a standstill and began to rise only after the economy
picked-up in 1991.
<P>
 This trend certainly affects the finances of environmental groups.
 Boerner and Kallery
found a correlation between per capita GNP and organizational
membership and revenue when they examined the Wilderness
Society, Sierra Club, National
Audubon Society, Natural
Resources Defense Council and the Nature
Conservancy.  Moreover, polling data showed that
support for environmental policy tracks economic concerns.  A
1992 survey found that 80 percent of the public agreed with the
statement &quot;protecting the environment is so important that
requirements and standards cannot be too high, and continuing
environmental improvements must be made regardless of cost.&quot;
 Yet in 1993, only 58 percent agreed with the statement.<SUP>67</SUP>
<P>
 Another factor is political leadership.  Environmentalists certainly
credit Reagan Interior Secretary James Watt
and EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch for their
own good fortune in fundraising.  As the radical <I>Nation</I>
columnist Alexander Cockburn and <I>Wild
Forest Review</I> editor Jeffrey St.
Clair argue: &quot;The venal but entirely harmless Watt was a
bankbook extravaganza to the mainstream environmental groups,
who sold him as Genghis incarnate.  Memberships doubled, budgets
tripled.  Everyone packed up, hired C.E.O.s at six-figure salaries
and moved to spacious quarters in D.C.&quot;
<P>
 The <I>Exxon Valdez</I> spill also filled
environmentalist coffers.  The dramatic spill off Alaska's coast
&quot;just really presented an opportunity,&quot; said Keller
Ries of the National
Wildlife Federation.  In 1990 membership for some groups, such
as Greenpeace and the Sierra
Club, peaked.  &quot;We're in the ironic situation where possibly
the nation's greatest environmental catastrophe ever is causing
this increased interest in environmental organizations,&quot;
noted Robert SanGeorge of the National
Audubon Society.
<P>
 The reverse may be happening now.  Susan Carson,
a former National Audubon Society
staffer told <I>The </I><I>Wall Street
Journal</I> that environmental groups are suffering from the &quot;Gore
effect.&quot;  &quot;The basic theory is that with Gore and Clinton
in power, the environmental shtick is being handled,&quot; she
says.  Environmental leaders think both economics
and politics are at work.  &quot;The No. 1 cause of our problems
has been the economy,&quot; said Ben Beach,
a Wilderness Society spokesman.  &quot;When
the economy went down, so did our membership.  The election of
Clinton and Gore
also didn't help.  Some people believed there was less need to
support environmental causes.&quot;
<P>
 Environmental groups have begun demonizing their opponents to
revive their sources of support.  The July 1994 joint fundraising
appeal signed by fifteen groups charged that &quot;even during
the Reagan / Watt / Gorsuch years, we have never faced such a
serious threat to our environmental laws in Congress.&quot;  Since
the November 1994 election, the rhetoric has sharpened.  Wilderness
Society president Jon Roush signed a fundraising
appeal claiming that &quot;Today, the Wilderness Society must
adapt to a new climate that flings storms of opposition against
our efforts to conserve America's precious natural heritage.&quot;
 The Sierra Club labeled the regulatory reform
proposals in the Republican &quot;Contract
With America&quot; a &quot;polluter's bill of rights&quot; and
an undeclared &quot;war on the environment.&quot;
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, a former
President of the League of
Conservation Voters, explained the fundraising tactics of environmental
lobbying organizations.<BR>

<P>
<blockquote> The bottom line for the environmentalists is how
do you induce people to send money to sustain the movement. .
. .  For years and years, they said, &quot;James Watt is out to
destroy life on Earth as we know it--send money.&quot;  &quot;The
Exxon Valdez just crashed--send money.&quot;  The game has changed.
 It's a lot harder now to begin the sentence that ends with &quot;Send
money.&quot;
</blockquote>
<P>
<B>OUTLINE</B>
<P>
 The environmental movement is at a crossroads.  Once environmental
groups made consistent strides towards ambitious policy objectives.
 Today, environmentalists are running into a brick wall.  Assorted
items on the environmentalist agenda face a variety of opponents
in statehouses and in the U.S. Congress,
and green fundraising has started to lag.  Can America's environmental
establishment overcome its recent failures?  Or will American
environmentalism take a new course?
<P>
 This book will survey recent developments that are affecting
environmental groups.  They are suffering declining memberships,
declining political fortunes, and the challenge posed by a so-called
&quot;environmental backlash.&quot;  But they remain a formidable
power in the world of Washington special interest lobbies.
<P>
 Chapter One reviews the &quot;first wave&quot; of environmental
groups--the conservation organizations that focused on land, resource
and wildlife conservation.  It examines their increasing reliance
on centralized federal regulation and government land ownership
to achieve their objectives.
<P>
 Chapter Two focuses on the &quot;second wave&quot; of groups
that were, almost literally, the products of Earth
Day 1970.  These groups were activists from the start, and they
launched the environmental movement's attack on modern industrial
society and its assault on the use of chemicals and advanced technologies.
<P>
 Chapter Three is on international environmentalism, from the
concept of &quot;sustainable development&quot; to the push for
population control.  The growing presence of American environmental
groups in the international arena is explored.
<P>
 Chapter Four analyzes the role environmental groups play in developing
public policies and shaping public opinion on environmental issues.
 It includes a look at the environmental curriculum in the schools
and discusses how environmental lobbyists exert influence in the
Clinton Administration.
<P>
 Chapter Five surveys where environmental groups get financial
support--from individuals, foundations and corporations--and describes
how environmental groups are trying to diversify their funding
base through government grants and the sale of commercial products.
<P>
 Chapter Six discusses emerging movements within environmentalism:
from the deep ecology movement and the environmental justice movement
to free market environmentalism and the property rights and &quot;wise-use&quot;
environmental backlash.
<P>
 Finally, appendices analyze the largest and most influential
environmental organizations operating in America today, their
sources of income, officers, and most important activities.<BR>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<i>The Rise of the Nanny
State</i> examines the origins, goals, and activities of the modern
consumer movement--a movement that, in the words of Capital Research
Center Visiting Fellow Tom Holt, &quot;does not address the needs
of consumers.  
<P>
Instead, it serves the bureaucratic interests of
governing elites and the ideological and organizational interests
of the movement itself.&quot; Holt paints a decidedly unflattering
portrait of the consumer movement.  As the recent Alar scare showed,
consumer advocates capitalize on the public's ignorance of science
and the media's eagerness for calamity.  Under the guise of public
health and safety, they seek to justify regulations dictating
their idea of the public good to our households and workplaces.
<P>
 With few exceptions, they advocate bigger and more intrusive
government and are hostile to free markets and personal responsibility.
Holt shows that the consumer movement has imposed significant
costs on industry--costs ultimately passed on to consumers--and
has violated individual freedoms in a futile effort to protect
us from our own actions and judgment.  Based on his analysis,
he calls for: major tort reform; the abolition of CAFE standards
and the Delaney clause; a reduced federal role in health care;
a major overhaul of the Consumer Product Safety Commission; and
other reforms of regulatory agencies.

<h3> Recommendations for the Future of the Fulbright Program</h3>
<P>
<ul>
 Policymakers need to critically re-examine the future role of
the Federal Government in sponsoring the Fulbright program of
international educational exchanges.  They will want to recognize
the program's very real accomplishments over the past half century.
 But they should question the contribution the Fulbright program
can make in a post-Cold War world.  And they should ask whether
that contribution is a national interest requiring government
funding.  This report recommends a substantial reevaluation
of the nature of the program and cites various changes that would
both continue the most valuable elements of the existing program,
while at the same time share its costs more equitably with other
countries and the academic community.
<P>
<B> 1.  Freeze Spending.</B>  The new Congress initially should
freeze spending on the Fulbright program at the existing level
and plan for a gradual reduction in future funding.  International
educational exchange is no longer a new idea requiring nurture.
 Programs that make possible overseas travel by hundreds of thousands
of scholars and students are well established throughout the world.
 It is no longer necessary to organize these programs under government
auspices and sponsorship.  As in so many other areas, private
and nonprofit institutions in civil society are the most appropriate
providers of institutional and financial support.  
<P>
 However, the Fulbright program is a prestigious program that
has been established by mutual agreements with other countries,
including our major allies and trading partners.  Consequently,
the program should continue, but grant awards should be limited
and they should be sustained in most countries by mutual and equivalent
levels of financial support.  During the past 48 years the U.S.
has provided $1.67 billion in Fulbright funding.  The time has
come to redesign the Fulbright program.  A program intended to
establish mutual understanding that is mutually beneficial should
be mutually supported.
<P>
<B> 2.  Require Foreign Contribution Levels Equal to U.S. Government
Support.</B>  Fifty binational commissions administer most of
the major Fulbright exchanges and they have made overseas Fulbright
programs a genuine collaborative endeavor.  But the mutual role
of U.S. and foreign counterparts in administering the program
should be accompanied, in most instances, by equivalent binational
financing.  
<P>
 Currently only ten countries contribute as much financial support
to the program as the United States.  The Fulbright program should
welcome an emphasis on mutuality with Western Europe, Japan and
other nations able to support joint exchanges.  Many governments,
including those of the so-called newly industrialized countries
of Asia, spend enormous sums to sponsor their students in the
United States.  Indeed, foreign governments pay about 5 percent
of the costs of all foreign students in the U.S.  They should
be willing to transfer some of these resources to the Fulbright
program.  By raising their contributions, wealthy countries would
share with the U.S. the cost of the program. 
<P>
 If these countries are unwilling to provide support at levels
equivalent to U.S. support, then the United States should reduce
its contribution to parity.  In bilateral programs where cost-sharing
is equivalent or where the U.S. contribution is less than the
foreign counterpart, U.S. support levels should not be ratcheted
upward.  Some of the funds &quot;saved&quot; by cost-sharing adjustments
should be reallocated to programs targeting former Soviet bloc
states and other newly emerging nations in Africa, the Middle
East or South Asia that lack the resources to support international
educational exchanges.  U.S. government funding can be steadily
reduced as more countries contribute their share to the program.
<P>
<B> 3.  Tighten Oversight.</B>  The Board of Foreign Scholarships,
which has responsibility for the Fulbright program, should conduct
a comprehensive review of program operations.  In particular,
the Board should initiate discussions on the above-mentioned reallocation
of program resources and on developing ways to increase foreign
government and private sources of support.  The Board and USIA
should also consider ways to involve new segments of the American
academic community.  For instance, currently only seven percent
of scholar grants go to those teaching at liberal arts colleges
and two percent of grants go to community college teachers.  There
should also be more competition in selecting the contract agencies
that actually develop the mechanisms for the review and nomination
of Fulbright candidates.
<P>
<B> 4.  De-emphasize Western Europe.</B>  Western Europe should
be de-emphasized as a destination for American scholars and students.
 Instead, the regional emphasis should move east to the emerging
democracies of the former Warsaw Pact countires.  Resources currently
allocated to Western Europe should be shifted to Central and Eastern
Europe.  This is an area of vital interest to the United States
and one where governments lack the resources and historical connections
to develop educational exchanges with us.
<P>
<B> 5.  Give Priority to U.S. Students.</B>  In allocating financial
support the Fulbright program should give priority to American
graduate students pursuing overseas studies over American senior
scholars.  For every six foreign students in the United States
one American student goes overseas.  Very few American graduate
students pursue overseas educations in countries outside Europe.
 Here is an area where Fulbright grants can provide a real incentive.
 Such grants are far more likely to have an impact on young careers
than grants to senior scholars.  Senator Fulbright is reported
to have commented pointedly in 1987 at a Fulbright alumni conference
that he had initially conceived the program for graduate students,
not faculty with their &quot;whole damn families.&quot;    
<P>
<B> 6.  Encourage Fulbright Alumni Support.</B>  The prestige
of the Fulbright program depends on its history and its distinguished
alumni.  This constituency can continue to play an important role
in facilitating international exchanges in the future.  Prominent
former Fulbright award recipients can encourage foreign governments
and private sources to provide funding.  By anticipating reduced
U.S. government support, Fulbright alumni can help sustain a program
from which personally they have greatly benefitted.  Alumni groups
in foreign countries and in the U.S. should initiate funding for
national programs, as Japanese alumni did when they established
a scholarship endowment fund.
<P>
<B> 7.  Maintain USIA Information Services.</B>  Fulbright program
officials and related USIA offices overseas should continue to
play an important and impartial role providing information on
U.S. academic opportunities and on the many nongovernment programs
providing scholarship assistance to foreign students and scholars.
 USIA library resources of college catalogues and information
on application procedures are particularly valuable, especially
in Central and Eastern Europe. 
<P>
<B> 8.  Back to Core Values:  </B>The central value of the Fulbright
program from its inception has been the prestige it has given
to America by making possible high quality international scholar
and student exchanges.  The program should return to its historic
roots as a small and important program with a clear mission. 
The total number of grants may diminish, but the Fulbright program
can foster academic exchanges that would not otherwise occur,
especially in newly emerging democratic countries.  Just as the
Fulbright program contributed to the reconstruction of post-World
War II Europe fifty years ago, so can it assist today in the construction
of a post-Cold War world.

<B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B>
<P>
 
<P>
  How can those who wish to create a charitable foundation best
ensure that their wishes will be followed after their deaths?
<P>
 In this important and timely book, Martin Morse Wooster provides
a well-reasoned answer to this question, as well as a fascinating
overview of the individuals, ideas, and beliefs that inspired
the creation of some of America's largest foundations. In some
cases, the intentions of those who created great philanthropies
have been faithfully adhered to by trustees. Unfortunately, however,
in most cases those intentions have been either ignored or brazenly
violated. 
<P>
Drawing on an examination of foundations that have either followed
or rejected the beliefs and wishes of their founders, Wooster
outlines a set of principles that wealthy donors should bear in
mind when considering the creation of a foundation. Given that
the &quot;baby boom&quot; generation is expected to transfer an
estimated $8 to $10 trillion over the next few decades--and that
a good portion of this wealth may go to philanthropy--Wooster's
guidelines may serve to prevent donors from bequeathing wealth
in ways they would regret.

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
 
<P>
 Two cultures of American anti-poverty philanthropy live upstairs
and downstairs from each other, sometimes meeting on the landings
but then moving off into different worlds and different world
views.
<P>
 We hear much about heavily funded, upstairs attempts to help
the poor through massive monetary intervention and political organization.
 Send dollars to anti-poverty organizations and provide housing
for the homeless, we are told, and all will be well.  Public relations
specialists guide the discontented and their genteel allies into
support of &quot;compassionate&quot; programs that provide healthy
salaries to those who direct them.
<P>
 We hear less about the downstairs culture that depends upon unpaid
or poorly-paid individuals spending hours of their weeks and years
of their lives in the truly compassionate activity of suffering
with those in need.  And what we hear is often overly-simplistic:
 the noble volunteer knight of the grassroots group slays the
dragon of poverty, and all live happily ever after.
<P>
 The reality is more complex.  Setting up new, downstairs programs
to combat poverty, or revitalizing stultified old ones, is hard.
 Cultural, economic and bureaucratic frustrations are often choking.
 The pioneers are sinner as well as saints, and they need to further
develop their own discipline as they seek to discipline others.
<P>
 Articles in <a href="/crc/pcs"><I>Philanthropy, Culture, and Society</I></a> over the
past three years have attempted to get at the reality.  From the
beginning, we de-emphasized theoretical essays and pressed for
descriptive reporting of both successes and failures.  Too often
those of us involved with foundations in one way or another tend
to sit at our computers and fund or write about good intentions,
without having paid our dues by pounding the pavements to find
out the reality.
<P>
 I became committed to the development of <I>Philanthropy, Culture,
and Society </I>three years ago when I attended an annual conference
of the Council on Foundations.  Two thousand foundation executives
and staff members met at the Chicago Hilton, historically -- according
to a hotel brochure -- &quot;the choice of visiting government
officials and royalty.&quot;
<P>
 Under sparkling chandeliers and surrounded by 22 karat gold leaf,
conference attendees heard about the need to help the homeless
by increasing funding for political efforts to change national
housing policy.  They contemplated such appeals while relaxing
in guest rooms &quot;richly appointed with traditional cherry
wood furnishings,&quot; according to a hotel brochure; attendees
washed their hands in bathrooms &quot;complete with gleaming brass
fixtures and lined with exquisite Italian marble.&quot;
<P>
 Attendees who really wanted to learn about homelessness, however,
could have learned far more by walking two blocks away, to the
Pacific Garden Mission.  Furnishings there were not ornate, but
the four-story mission did offer dormitories with &quot;sturdy
army-type beds&quot; for some 300 men and 40 women, with &quot;12
white porcelain showers for each floor,&quot; according to a mission
brochure.  The mission offered other amenities as well:  a guest
there placed &quot;his clothing on the hanger, which is hung for
the night in a delousing unit.&quot;
<P>
 Mirrored ballrooms at the conference were filled with rhetoric
about &quot;social change,&quot; &quot;justice,&quot; &quot;moving
toward a multicultural outlook,&quot; and &quot;accepting the
homeless as they are.&quot;  Plastic chairs on a linoleum floor
at the mission two blocks away were filled with 200 black, white
and Hispanic men and women who were in or had just come out of
the drug and alcohol culture, and their words were different:
 &quot;I praise God that He saved me from drugs,&quot; or &quot;I'm
living for drugs, I want to be free.&quot;
<P>
 The articles that follow avoid the mirrored ballrooms and concentrate
on the linoleum and the long twilight struggles that occur there.
 Some of the articles are generally positive, and others describe
the failure of attempts to merge the personal approach with government
dollars and a philanthropically correct vision of societal oppression.
 All are expressions of directed reporting:  each author appreciates
downstairs philanthropy and has pounded the pavements to describe
objective reality as accurately as he or she can.
<P>
 The articles, written by ten different authors, have several
common conclusions that I will summarize in an afterword.  But
the point of these varied articles is not simply to provide a
1-2-3 set of poverty-fighting techniques; for that, a textbook
would do as well.  Rather, these articles provide texture.  They
show the interplay of principles with hard practice.  They show
the importance of perseverance.
<P>
 Most western movies provide action but few memorable lines. 
My four sons and I the other day, however, were watching one of
the best, The Magnificent Seven (1961), which tells of how seven
Texas gunfighters come to the defense of a village that previously
had succumbed to a bandit gang.  We were struck by the words of
a gunfighter who is surrounded by a circle of admiring children.
 &quot;We are ashamed to live here,&quot; one boy says.  &quot;Our
fathers are cowards.&quot;
<P>
 The gunfighter replies, &quot;You think I am brave because I
carry a gun, but your fathers are much braver because they carry
responsibility for you, your brothers, your sisters, and your
mothers, and this responsibility is like a big rock that weighs
a ton.  It bends and twists them until finally it buries them
under the ground.  And there's nobody that says they have to do
this.  They do it because they love you and because they want
to.&quot;
<P>
 The gunfighter concludes, &quot;I have never had this kind of
courage, running a farm, working like a mule every day with no
guarantee what will ever come of it.  This is bravery.  It's why
I never even started anything like that.  It's why I never will.&quot;
 And the gunfighter is killed at the end of the film, but the
bandits are defeated and the village will be able to survive and
perhaps even thrive.
<P>
 Upstairs philanthropists think they will save our despondent
inner city villages of today by constructing some shining new
buildings and shiny new programs.  But downstairs philanthropists
seek out those people in the neighborhood who, faced with crime
and drugs and bad public schools, still try to be good citizens,
who raise their children properly.  If this responsibility were
removed, the residents would become mere drones, their lives full
of drudgery, without noble purpose.
<P>
 It is philanthropically correct to want massive government programs
that promise to transform society.  But downstairs philanthropy
says to the courageous, &quot;We honor your bravery.  We acknowledge
that though you are poor, you are doing vital work.  We will not
undermine your efforts by imposing our theories of social change.
 Instead, we will help you have safe streets and decent schools.
<P>
 &quot;We will help, not by depriving you of your purpose, but
by helping you bear the burden with dignity and a society's gratitude
-- and together, we will throw the bandits out.&quot;

          <H2>   <CENTER> Federal Court Finds Violence Against
                   Women Act Unconstitutional</CENTER></H2>

 <P>    In a case which has received national attention, Federal
Judge Jackson Kiser declared the Violence Against Women Act
(VAWA) unconstitutional.

<P>     VAWA, which passed as part of the omnibus crime bill of
1994, created a federal civil action for crimes motivated by
"discriminatory animus" against gender.  In passing VAWA,
Congress created a broad new federal tort for crimes which
traditionally have fallen under state jurisdiction.

<P>     In <EM>Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic Institute</EM>, a
student at Virginia Tech filed suit under VAWA against two members of
the Virginia Tech football team--Antonio Morrison and James
Crawford--for
 an alleged rape.  A Virginia Federal Court found Friday that
Congress did not have constitutional authority to enact VAWA,
which if implemented would have the effect of "excessively
extending Congress's power and of inappropriately tipping the
balance [of power] away from the states."  Judge Kiser emphasized the
importance of the issues at stake in warning that "[Congress']
authority to act is limited by the Constitution, and the
constitutional limits must be respected if our federal system is to
survive."

<P>     The court's decision to strike down VAWA has the added
benefit of dismissing federal lawsuits against what by all
accounts are two innocent men.  Defendants Morrison and Crawford
were cleared of rape charges by both the Virginia Tech campus
disciplinary body and the state grand jury, yet still faced
federal VAWA charges for a complaint made over seven months after the
alleged rape, by an accuser who was unable to identify them
accurately.

 <P>    Michael E. Rosman, co-counsel for Antonio Morrison and
General Counsel for the Center for Individual Rights, stated that "We
are delighted with the outcome of this case and believe that Judge
Kiser's opinion, by dint of its reasoning and careful analysis, will
influence many courts on this same issue."  Mr. Morrison is also
represented by W. David Paxton and M. Christina Floyd of the Roanoke
firm of Gentry, Locke, Rakes & Moore.  Mr. Crawford is represented by
Joseph Graham Painter, Jr., a solo practioner in Blackbury, Virginia.

<P>     To receive a copy of the decision, or for more information
about the case, call Robert Alt, Director of Public Relations and
Education for the Center for Individual Rights, at 202-833-8400, ext.
101.

                         COMPLAINT

               NATURE AND SUMMARY OF THE ACTION

1. This is a civil action for declaratory and injunctive relief
arising from defendants' violation of plaintiff's constitutional
and civil rights and liberties under the United States
Constitution and federal law. 

2.   Plaintiff COLUMBIA UNION COLLEGE, a private college
affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, seeks:
  
(a)  a declaration that the conduct of the defendants in
applying and administering the Father Sellinger Program for
the State of Maryland, which denies plaintiff the same benefits
(including, but not limited to, eligibility to receive financial
aid paid to Maryland schools of higher education) granted other
similarly situated colleges and universities, and which denies
plaintiff such funds solely and expressly because of the content
or viewpoint of plaintiff's speech and beliefs, violates
plaintiffs rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association,
free exercise of religion, and to equal protection under the law,
as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the
United States Constitution; 

(b)  a permanent order enjoining defendants from continuing to
apply a policy of discriminating against plaintiff in the
appropriation of Father Sellinger Program financial aid or in any
other manner on the basis of: the content or viewpoint of
plaintiff's speech and belief or on the basis of the content or
viewpoint of the speech of the Seventh-day Adventist Church with
which plaintiff is affiliated; its expression; its exercise of
religion; or its association;

(c)  such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

                       JURISDICTION

3.   This action arises under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction
over the claims is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. Sections
1331 and 1343, by 42 U.S.C. Sections 1983, and by 42 U.S.C.
Section 2000bb-l(c). Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to 42
U.S.C. Section 1983, and claims all available relief pursuant to
that statute, including attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C. Section
1998.

                            VENUE

                      GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

23.  As provided for in the Code of Maryland, Education, Title
17, the Commission is charged with the authority to implement and
administer the Father Sellinger Program.  One of its
responsibilities is to receive and review applications for aid
and determine whether the institutions applying for aid are
eligible to receive Father Sellinger Program funds under the
criteria set forth in Md. Code Ann, Edu. Section 17-103.

24.  Md. Code Ann. Edu. Section 17-103 sets forth the following
eligibility requirements: 

1)  the institution must have been established prior to July 1,
1970; 2) it must be accredited by the State Department of
Education; 3) it must maintain more than one associate of arts or
baccalaureate degree programs; 4) it must submit for approval any
new programs or major alteration of programs to the Commission;
and 5) it must refrain from utilizing any of the money payable
under the Father Sellinger Program for sectarian purposes.

25.  Currently, and at all times relevant herein, the
Commission has set forth the guidelines and procedures for the
distribution of Father Sellinger Program funds to eligible
institutions.

26.  During the period relevant to this lawsuit, the Commission,
subject to the review of the Maryland Board of Public Works and
the recommendation of the Maryland Attorney General, regularly
distributed Father Sellinger Program Funds to colleges and
universities within Maryland.  Upon information and belief, this
practice dates back at least to 1957. 

27.  Upon information and belief, colleges and universities 
receiving Father Sellinger Program funds in the past have
included institutions that are affiliated with religions.  For
example, Mount St. Mary's College, Loyola University, and Notre
Dame College of Maryland have received Father Sellinger Program
funds and are affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.  These
institutions are dedicated to the Catholic point of view and have
engaged in and continue to engage in sectarian activities and
expression. 

28.  In January 1990, Columbia Union submitted an application
to receive Father Sellinger Program funds to the Commission. 

29.  The application of Columbia Union for Father Sellinger
Program funds conformed with all applicable, content-neutral
Commission requirements.  In particular, Columbia Union was
established before July 1, 197O; it was then and is now
accredited by the State Department of Education; it maintains
numerous degree programs other than seminarian or theological
degrees; it agreed to submit any new programs or major program
alteration to the Commission for approval; and it agreed to use
Father Sellinger Program funds for non-sectarian purposes only.
                                
30.  On April 14, 1992, the Commission found that the college is
"pervasively sectarian" and denied Columbia Union's application
for aid. 

31.  The Commission offered no reason other than the alleged
status of Columbia Union as "pervasively sectarian" as a
basis to deny funding.

32.  On December 27, 1995, Dr. Charles Scriven, President of
Columbia Union, sought reconsideration of the Commission's
refusal to provide Columbia Union with Father Sellinger Program
Funds in light of the decision of the United States Supreme Court
in Rosenberger v. The Rector and Visitors at the University of
Virginia, 115 S. Ct. 2510 (1995).

33. On January 22, 1996, defendant William P. Howard, Assistant
Attorney General of Maryland, writing at the request of the
Commission, replied to Dr. Scriven's request, stating that
"unless the nature and practices of Columbia Union have changed
very substantially since 1992, I do not believe there would be
any point in pursuing a new application for private aid at this
time." 

34.  Defendants have denied, and, unless enjoined, will continue
to deny Father Sellinger Program funds to plaintiff solely and
expressly on the basis of plaintiff's viewpoint, content of its
expression, and the free exercise of religion by its faculty and
students. 

35.  Defendants cannot demonstrate a compelling interest
sufficient to justify the denial of Father Sellinger Program
funds to plaintiff, nor can defendants demonstrate that the
denial of funding is narrowly drawn to satisfy any such state
interest.

                     COUNT ONE: VIOLATION OF
                FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION

36.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 35
am incorporated herein by this reference.

37.  Although defendants have provided Father Sellinger Program
funding to a wide variety of colleges and universities that
engage in religious and secular expression, defendants have
illegally and unconstitutionally denied plaintiff Father
Sellinger Program funds based solely an the content or viewpoint
of plaintiffs speech, communications, identity, activities, or
affiliation.
 
38.  Plaintiff has unjustifiably and unlawfully been denied
benefits to which it was and is entitled as an eligible
institution as set forth in Maryland Code, Education, Title 17. 
This loss was the result of state action. This state action
violated and continues to violate plaintiff's rights of free
speech and free association under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments to the United States Constitution. The denial of
Father Sellinger Program funds to plaintiff constitutes
impermissible viewpoint and content discrimination. There exists
no compelling state interest to justify the defendants' actions. 
Moreover, even if there is some compelling state interest,
defendants actions are not narrowly tailored to achieve that
interest.

39.  The Commission's guidelines and definitions for allocating
Father Sellinger Program funds to institutions are unlawfully
vague in that persons of common intelligence must necessarily
guess at their meaning and differ as to their application, and
are also overbroad in that they reach constitutionally protected
activity.

40.  By virtue of the unlawful policies and conduct of
defendants, plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer injury
to its rights of free speech, free association and free exercise
of religion, and to the furtherance of its lawful activities.

                 COUNT TWO: VIOLATION OF FREE
                     EXERCISE OE RELIGION

41.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 40
are incorporated herein by this reference.

42. The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the
United States Constitution prohibits government discrimination in
the allocation of benefits or imposition of burdens based upon an
individual's or group's religious beliefs, character, or
affiliation, or based upon the religious content of their
expression and is applicable to state action under the Fourteenth
Amendment. 

43.  Defendants impermissibly and unlawfully denied plaintiff
Father Sellinger Program funds generally available to other
Maryland colleges and universities. This denial was based upon
plaintiff's religious beliefs, character, affiliation, speech,
and association.

44.  Defendants have not shown and cannot show that denying
plaintiff Father Sellinger Program funds to which it is lawfully
entitled is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, nor
can defendants show that such a denial is a narrowly drawn
means of achieving that interest. 

45.  Defendants' conduct has deprived and continues to deprive
plaintiff of its right to free exercise of religion as guaranteed
under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
Constitution. 

46.  Defendants' conduct constitutes a failure to give reasonable
accommodation to plaintiff's religious beliefs.

47.  By virtue of the unlawful policies and conduct of the
defendants, plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer injury
to its rights of religious freedom and to the furtherance of its
lawful activities.

                  COUNT THREE: VIOLATION OF EQUAL
                       PROTECTION OF THE LAWS

48.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 47 are
incorporated herein by this reference.

49.  By denying plaintiff the benefits to which other colleges
and universities are entitled, defendants unlawfully and
unconstitutionally have treated and continue to treat plaintiff
differently from other similarly situated colleges and
universities on the basis of the content or viewpoint of its
speech, association, beliefs, character, affiliation, identity,
and activity.

50.  By denying plaintiff the benefits that other colleges and
universities engaging in religious speech and activities receive
and have received, defendants unlawfully and unconstitutionally
treat plaintiff differently from other similarly situated
colleges and universities on the basis of its religious speech,
association, beliefs, character, affiliation, identity, and
activity. 

51.  Defendants' conduct under color of state law violates the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United
States Constitution in that it constitutes discrimination on a
suspect basis and violates fundamental constitutional rights. 
This violation is not justified by a compelling state interest
and is not accomplished by narrowly drawn means. Defendants have
singled out plaintiff and denied it Father Sellinger Program
funds based upon the content or viewpoint of its affiliation, its
speech, its expression, and its association.

52.  Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer injury to its
rights of equal protection under the law, and to the furtherance
of its lawful activities, by virtue of the unlawful policies
and conduct of the defendants.

                      COUNT IV: VIOLATION OF
                 RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT

53.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 52 are
incorporated herein by this reference.

54.  Defendants impermissibly and unlawfully denied plaintiff
Father Sellinger Program funds generally available to other
Maryland colleges and universities.  This denial was based upon
plaintiff's religious beliefs, character, affiliation, speech,
and association.

55.  Defendants' denial of Father Sellinger Program funds to
plaintiff substantially burdens the free exercise of religion by
plaintiff and its students and faculty.

56.  Defendants have not shown and cannot show that denying
plaintiff Father Sellinger Program funds to which it is lawfully
entitled is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, nor
can defendants show that such a denial is a narrowly drawn means
of achieving that interest. 

57.  By virtue of the unlawful policies and conduct of the
defendants, plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer injury
to its rights of religious freedom and to the furtherance of its
lawful activities, in violation of Religious Freedom Restoration
Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 2000bb through 2000bb-4.

                     PETITION FOR RELIEF

58.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 57 are
incorporated herein by this reference.

59.  Plaintiff has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at
law.

60.  Plaintiff is suffering, and will continue to suffer, 
irreparable injury for the period of the continued violation
of its constitutional rights. 

61.  Absent an injunction, defendants will continue to
violate Columbia Union's constitutional and statutory rights.

WHEREFORE, having stated claims against the defendants under the
United States Constitution and federal law, plaintiff petitions
this Court for the following relief:          

A.   a declaratory judgment that the conduct of the defendants in
establishing and applying a policy for the State of Maryland
which refuses to allow the same benefits to plaintiff as to other
similar colleges and universities (benefits including the receipt
of Father Sellinger Program funds) and which denies plaintiff
Father Sellinger Program funds solely and expressly because of
the content or viewpoint of its speech (1) violates plaintiffs
rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association, free
exercise of religion, and to equal protection under the law, as
guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United
States Constitution, and (2) that such actions of defendants are
in violation of 42 U.S.C. Sections 2000bb et seq.;

B.   a permanent order enjoining the defendants from maintaining
and applying a policy of discrimination against plaintiff in the
appropriation of Father Sellinger Program funds or in any other
manner on the basis of plaintiff's speech or on the basis of the
content or viewpoint of the speech or the religion with which
plaintiff is affiliated;

C.  an order awarding plaintiff reasonable costs and attorneys'
fees pursuant to Section 2 of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees
Award Act of 1976, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 1988 (1988); and

D. Such other relief as the court deems just and proper.

For Immediate Release<BR>



                  <CENTER>         <H2>CUC Claims Denial of Free Speech/Exercise of Religion</H2>
                             <H2> In Administration of Tuition Assistance Program</H2><BR></CENTER>


        
<P>        Columbia Union College filed a lawsuit in Federal Court Wednesday claiming that Maryland's
Higher Education Commission unconstitutionally discriminated against the college's religious viewpoint in
its administration of the Father Sellinger Program.  The program, established in 1971, provides state
funding to Maryland's private colleges--both religious and non-religious--to reduce tuition costs.

<P>        Columbia Union, a Seventh-day Adventist college located in Tacoma Park, Maryland, complies
with all state eligibility requirements for Sellinger funding, including a provision requiring recipients to
refrain from using funds for sectarian purposes.  Nevertheless, CUC was denied funding based upon the
commission's claim that the school is "pervasively religious," making it ineligible for funding due to
perceived church-state separation requirements arising from the First Amendment's Establishment
Clause.  Maryland has continued to deny CUC funding since its initial request in 1991, despite funding
other religious schools, including Mount St. Mary's College, Loyola University, and College of Notre
Dame of Maryland.

 <P>       CUC is challenging Maryland's decision, claiming that denial of funds on the basis of religious
viewpoint constitutes a violation of Free Speech and Free Exercise rights guaranteed by the First
Amendment, as well as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  This claim is supported by the Supreme
Court's 1995 decision in Rosenberger v. The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in which
the Court found the University of Virginia's refusal to grant funding to a student publication solely on the
basis of religious viewpoint violated the Free Speech guarantee of the First Amendment.

 <P>       Columbia Union is represented by R. Hewitt Pate of Hunton & Williams, and by the Center for
Individual Rights, a non-profit public interest law firm which represented the successful plaintiffs in
Rosenberger.

  <P>      Michael Rosman, General Counsel for the Center for Individual Rights declared:  "Maryland's
discrimination against Columbia Union violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act, and simply cannot be reconciled with the Supreme Court's decision in
Rosenberger.  We are pleased to represent CUC in this case."

  <P>      To receive a copy of the complaint, or for more information, please call Robert Alt, Director of
Public Affairs for the Center for Individual Rights, at 202-833-8400, ext. 101.

<H3>THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE</H3>
</center>
<P>Publication of this extra-length <I>Docket Report</I> was delayed by the Fifth Circuit's momentous 
ruling in <I>Hopwood v. State of Texas</I>, our challenge to racial preferences in student admissions at the 
University of Texas Law School.  We won, and UT lost.  The defendants have asked for an emergency stay, 
arguing <I>inter alia</I> that the cessation of discrimination in student admissions would impose &quot;administrative 
burdens.&quot;  Details on the decision and its near-nuclear fallout on pages 2-5 of this <I>Report</I>.
<P>
<P>In addition to the <I>Hopwood</I> home run, we scored an anti-quota double.  In February, we settled 
a lawsuit against the National Science Foundation and Texas A &amp; M over selected-minorities-only 
summer study programs.  The defendants agreed to pay damages and fees and to desist from further race 
discrimination.  And in March, Ohio State University shelled out $368,000 to end our attack on OSU's 
minorities-only contracting program.  These matters having been settled, we teed up two additional 
race-exclusive programs with federal participation--one in Delaware, the other in Texas.
<P>
<P>In Ithaca, NY, Judge Rumsey of the New York Supreme Court (Tompkins County) heard oral 
arguments on Cornell University's motion to dismiss our lawsuit on behalf of Professor James B. Maas.  
While the motion is still pending, a Cornell faculty committee has concluded that the procedures under 
which Maas was sentenced were egregiously flawed, amply confirming our contention that Jim Maas got shafted.
<P>
<P>Speaking of which, we have agreed to represent two additional victims of the harassment craze.  
Cid Scallet was fired from his teaching job at the University of Virginia's Darden School of 
Management because the powers-that-be hated his politics.  Unable to find a legitimate reason for firing Scallet, 
Darden officials framed him for sexual harassment, the allegation being that Scallet modeled his socks 
provocatively in front of his class.  (No, we're not kidding). 
<P>
<P>More serious charges have been leveled against CIR client Antonio Morrison, a black student 
athlete at Virginia Polytechnic University:  a white female fellow-student has falsely accused Morrison 
of rape and has filed a lawsuit against against him, Virginia Tech, and other defendants.  The plaintiff 
has made a claim under the federal Violence Against Women Act of 1994, which penalizes crimes 
committed against women because of a discriminatory animus.  The &quot;proof&quot; of Morrison's mysogynist bias is 
his alleged failure to wear a condom during an assault he did not commit.
<P>
<P>The country has gone insane, but we're here to save it.  Evidence, as always, in these pages.

 <H2>            Consent Decree in <EM>Henry Painting v. OSU</EM> <BR>Enjoins The State of Ohio<BR>
 From Continuing 100% Racial Set-Aside<BR>
State To Pay Plaintiff $368,000 in Damages And Fees</H2>
  </STRONG><BR><BR>
 <H3> Federal Judge to Monitor State's Compliance for Next 5 Years</H3></CENTER>

   <P>  Henry Painting Co. v. Ohio State University, a widely watched
lawsuit challenging OSU's one-hundred percent minority set-aside, ended
today when the parties signed a binding judicial consent degree.  

<P>     In a stunning victory for the plaintiff, the State of Ohio
agreed to an injunction against "considering race, color, national
origin, gender, social or economic disadvantage, or any factor
other than standard State procurement policies and practices, in
awarding painting contracts at The Ohio State University."  

 <P>    OSU further agreed to pay the plaintiff, Mr. Jerry Henry,
$368,000 in damages and attorneys' fees in exchange for Mr. Henry's
agreement to drop his lawsuit.  Under the terms of the consent
decree, the federal court will retain jurisdiction over the case
for five years.  Should OSU violate the terms of the decree, the
court may impose "all sanctions and remedies authorized by law or
equity." 

 <P>    "I am delighted that we have won." said Mr. Henry.  "My case
has forced the University to end its decade-long practice of
setting aside 100% of painting contacts exclusively on the basis of
race."         

 <P>    Henry, who operates a small, family-run painting company in
Columbus, had filed the case in federal district court for the
Southern District of Ohio on March 30, 1994, after years of racial
discrimination by OSU.

 <P>    Until 1986, Mr. Henry had done hundreds of thousands of
dollars of business each year with OSU.   Beginning in 1986,
however, and continuing through the filing of the lawsuit, the
University refused to allow Mr. Henry to bid on painting contracts
solely because he is white.   

 <P>    OSU engaged in this blatant racial discrimination pursuant to
an Ohio State Minority Business Act, applicable to all state
agencies, which sets aside 15 percent of total state expenditures
each year for selected minority-owned businesses.  Because OSU was
unable to locate any minority bidders in certain lines of work, it
contrived to reach its 15 percent "goal" by reserving all of its
painting contracts exclusively for minorities.  OSU and State
officials rejected Henry's repeated requests to change the policy.

<P>      "The results of this lawsuit will have far-reaching
consequences," said Michael A. Carvin of Shaw, Pittman, Potts and
Trowbridge, who represented Mr. Henry jointly with attorneys at the
Center for Individual Rights.  "The case shows that the State of
Ohio is incapable of defending the constitutionality of its
Minority Business Enterprise Act.  In light of the substantial
damages in this case, it's only a matter of time before the State's
entire system of racial preferences comes tumbling down."

<P>     Michael P. McDonald, President of the Center for Individual
Rights and Carvin's co-counsel on the case, added:  "The Henry
decree is part of the larger trend that we are seeing of successful
lawsuits to end racial discrimination.  I would expect to see state
agencies in Ohio and elsewhere to take a very hard look at their
set-aside practices unless they, too, want to be sued."

<P>     The Center for Individual Rights is a non-profit public
interest law firm based in Washington, D.C.  CIR provides free
legal assistance to deserving clients in cases raising important
legal and constitutional issues.  Last week, CIR won an important
legal victory for its clients in <EM>Hopwood v. State of Texas</EM>, a case
in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ended
racial preferences in student admissions to the University of Texas
Law School.  

 <P>    For further information about the Henry case, please contact
either Michael A. Carvin at (202) 663-8346 or Michael P. McDonald

-v-							JUDGE SMITH

THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, ET AL.,

Defendants.
</PRE>
<CENTER><U>CONSENT DECREE</U></CENTER>
<P>This action was filed by Plaintiffs on March 10, 1994 seeking a
judgment declaring unconstitutional certain provisions of the
Ohio Minority Business Enterprise Act (Ohio Rev. Code SS 122.71,
123.141 and 125.081)("OMBEA").  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants
have unconstitutionally discriminated against them on the basis
of race in the awarding of contracts for painting only to
minority businesses.  These allegations were denied by
Defendants.  The Court's jurisdiction is invoked pursuant to 28
U.S.C. SS 2201 and 2202.   Plaintiffs also seek a permanent
injunction preventing Defendants from applying or enforcing the
OMBEA, and monetary damages under 24 U.S.C. SS 2000d and 2000d-7.
Nothing contained in this Consent Decree, and no actions taken by
Defendants with respect to this Decree, shall be treated         
as an admission of liability by Defendants.

    <P>      The Plaintiffs and Defendants, in good faith, desire to
amicably compromise, settle, and resolve their dispute so as to
avoid the costs and inconvenience of further litigation. 
Accordingly, the parties have consented to the entry of this

contracts at The Ohio State University.<BR><BR>

II. <U>NOTICE</U>

<P>IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant, The Ohio State University
will notify and undertake an educational program as to its

entry of this Decree.  For the duration of this Decree, a copy of
this Decree shall be provided to all new members of the Board of
Trustees, and any new employee responsible for the awarding
and/or selection of painting contractors, or who assume these
responsibilities, within thirty (30) days of taking the office or
assuming such responsibilities.<BR><BR>

III. <U>MONETARY PAYMENT</U>

<P>IT IS ALSO ORDERED, that on or by April 30, 1996, Defendant The
Ohio State University shall deliver a certified check payable to
Henry Painting Company and Jerry Henry, jointly, in the amount of
Two Hundred and Forty Thousand Dollars and 00/100 ($240,000.00). 
The payment of this sum is in full settlement of any claims that
Plaintiffs have or ever had against Defendants.


<P>IT IS ALSO ORDERED that on or by April 30, 1996, Defendant The
Ohio State University shall deliver a certified check payable to
the Center for Individual Rights in the amount of One Hundred
Twenty Eight Thousand Dollars and 00/100 ($128,000.00).  The
payment of this sum represents full payment of Plaintiffs,
reasonable attorney fees in this case.


  <P>        Plaintiffs shall also execute, on or by April 30, 1996,
a release signifying that the amounts received pursuant to this
order represent full and complete compensation for all alleged
injuries and constitutes full settlement of any claims (including
claims for costs and attorneys' fees) that may have related to
the subject matter of this lawsuit.<BR><BR>

IV. <U>REMEDIES FOR NON-PERFORMANCE</U>

<P>     The parties to this Consent Decree shall endeavor in good
faith to resolve informally any differences regarding
interpretation of and compliance with this order prior to
bringing such matters to the Court for resolution.  However, in
the event of a failure by the Defendants, whether willful or
otherwise, to perform any obligation imposed by, or otherwise
comply with this Decree, they will be subject to all sanctions
and remedies authorized by law-or equity.  The Court shall retain
jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this order.  After five
years from entry of this Order, Defendants may move for
dissolution of the decree and dismissal of the case.  The Court
will resolve that motion pursuant to the legal and equitable
standards governing such proceedings.

<P>IT IS SO ORDERED.<BR><BR><BR>

                                  RACE PREFERENCES IN STUDENT ADMISSIONS</h2>

                                                                          March 19, 1996<BR>

</CENTER>
   <P>     In a widely-followed case, a unanimous panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held
that the University of Texas Law School's use of racial preferences in student admissions is
unconstitutional.

  <P>      In its March 18 decision, Hopwood v. State of Texas, the Fifth Circuit declared that
"diversity" is not a "compelling state interest" that would justify the use of racial preferences. 
The Court stated that "[w]ithin the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the use of
race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims
of equal protection.  Diversity fosters, rather than minimizes, the use of race.  It treats
minorities as a group, rather than as individuals."  The Fifth Circuit held that Justice Powell's
opinion in Board of Regents v. Bakke, in which he advocated the consideration of race to achieve
"diversity," never represented the view of a majority of the Supreme Court.

<P>        The Fifth Circuit held further that the government may employ racial preferences only
as a means of redressing past discrimination by a particular government unit--in this case, UT
Law School.  Racial preferences may not be used to redress alleged discrimination by entire
educational systems. 

 <P>       Theodore B. Olson, the plaintiffs' lead attorney, expressed satisfaction with the ruling. 
"This is a strong opinion that clarifies the law in many important areas," Olson said.  "We
expect that the University of Texas will now comply with the Constitution."  Added his co-
counsel, Michael E. Rosman of the Center for Individual Rights:  "The opinion exposes the folly
of thinking that we can get beyond race by taking race into account.  The decision will be widely
discussed." 

<P>        The Fifth Circuit panel was composed of Judges Jerry E. Smith (who wrote the court's
opinion), Harold DeMoss, and Jacques Wiener. 
  
  <P>      The plaintiffs in the case, white applicants to the 1992 incoming class, were denied
admission on the basis of their race despite their superior qualifications.  Cheryl Hopwood and
Douglas Carvell are represented pro bono by Theodore B. Olson and Douglas Cox of Gibson,
Dunn & Crutcher and by Michael E. Rosman, General Counsel of the Center for Individual
Rights.

<P>        For comments call Theodore B. Olson at (202) 955-8500.  Copies of the opinion and
further information may be obtained from CIR at (202) 833-8400, ext. 103 or 104.    <BR><BR>

</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER"><a href="#erler">By Edward J. Erler</a></P>
</B><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></FONT><A HREF="http://www.claremont.org/dale.htm"><FONT SIZE=2>Go to the Brief</FONT></A></P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The filing of <I>amicus curiae</I> (friend of the court) briefs is an important part of the judicial process.  It gives interested parties the chance to submit arguments to the court that would otherwise not be made by the immediate parties to a case.  The Claremont Institute's amicus briefs concentrate on important issues of constitutional law and the moral underpinnings of the Constitution.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the 1995 case of <I>Dale v. Boy Scouts of America</I>, a New Jersey superior court upheld the refusal of the Boy Scouts to admit an avowed homosexual to a Scout leadership position. James Dale had been a member of the Scouts from the age of eight, eventually achieving the rank of Eagle Scout.  As provided by the By-Laws of the Boy Scouts, his status as a Scout terminated when he reached the age of eighteen.  Because of his exemplary record as a Scout, Dale was offered a commission as Assistant Scoutmaster. In the meantime, Dale had enrolled at Rutgers University and became co-president of the University's Lesbian and Gay Alliance.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1990, a Newark newspaper published an article featuring a picture of Dale with the caption &quot;Seminar addresses needs of homosexual teens&quot; and identifying his position in the Lesbian and Gay Alliance. The article came to attention of the Boy Scouts and Dale was terminated as a Scout Leader.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dale alleged that his dismissal violated New Jersey laws forbidding discrimination in places of public accommodation.  But the New Jersey superior court made the obvious point that &quot;Boy Scouts of America is not a place; it is an entity which embraces and projects through its organization certain moral concepts and values.  It neither owns or controls a 'place' from which Dale has been excluded.&quot; The court noted that Boy Scouts meet in various places-meeting halls, tents, remote mountain and wooded venues-and that &quot;the benefits to the boys spring not from the 'facility' but from their interaction, training and experiences as a group.&quot; Furthermore, none of the Scout activities or places are open to the public.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More importantly, the superior court rightly held that no one has a &quot;right&quot; to become a Boy Scout or a Boy Scout Leader; anyone who wants to be a Scout or a Leader must conform to the standards and conditions of membership. Indeed, the court recognized that the Boy Scouts &quot;is a moral organization&quot; which requires its members to be &quot;morally straight&quot; and &quot;clean.&quot; Thus, &quot;according to its mission and purpose, BSA has determined that an assistant scoutmaster who is an active sodomist is simply incompatible with scouting and is not 'morally straight.'&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The court noted that New Jersey law no longer criminalizes sodomy. But while &quot;the criminal law has changed. . . the moral law-as to the act of sodomy-has not.&quot;  And, as the court laconically notes, &quot;BSA did not change its moral stance thereafter simply because the criminal law changed.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, if &quot;Dale wishes to pursue his own life-style. . . [h]e has a constitutional right to do so, now that the act is no longer criminal. But he cannot compel BSA to continue his volunteer adult leadership status when he is not in compliance with the Scout Oath, the Scout Law and the Statement of Religious Principle.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The court thus properly upheld the right of the Boy Scouts to maintain its character as an organization whose principal purpose is the moral education of young boys and young men, an education that &quot;requires of them a belief in God (the benevolent and loving Creator) and, through the Scout Oath, the Scout Law and the Scout Handbook an adherence to the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule.&quot; These are moral principles that are widely under attack today by groups that seek to promote the tenets of ideological liberalism-self-assertion and sexual diversity.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Claremont Institute's Amicus Brief in support of the Boy Scouts urges the court of appeals to affirm the lower court's ruling in <I>Dale v. Boy Scouts of America</I>.  </P>

<dd>
-- By Charles L. Heatherly

<P>
<I> Where will all this newly acquired coolness leave the Republicans after the dust settles and the Clinton-Gore administration claims credit for whatever compromise legislation is eventually enacted? Do such pale "victories" provide the building blocks for expanding their majority in the 1998 congressional elections? Do they tell the citizens of the nation how a Republican government would differ from the status quo? Will such a me-too strategy give Republicans a platform for recapturing the White House in the year 2000?
These are the questions conservatives are asking themselves these days. </I>

<TITLE>CLINTON'S CRAFT AND THE REPUBLICAN DRIFT</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY LINK="#0000ff" BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<a name="top"> </a>
<B><FONT SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">CLINTON'S CRAFT AND THE REPUBLICAN DRIFT</P>
</B></FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER"><a href="#cheath">By Charles L. Heatherly</a></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his Inaugural Address President Clinton announced an armistice in the war of ideas. He declared, &quot;we have resolved for our time the great debate over the role of government.&quot;  He hailed America's new consensus: for the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century we need a government &quot;that is smaller. . . and does more with less.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same day Rush Limbaugh interpreted the president's Inaugural remarks as a concession speech, and accepted the victory in his usual magnanimous fashion. That Clinton is still a liberal in his heart doesn't matter, argued Limbaugh. The war of ideas is over if liberalism can survive only in conservative garb. Clinton has retooled the Democratic party as a centrist party; thus, Republicans still have the upper hand in the shaping of the policy agenda.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That belief has been popular among beltway conservatives for many years, but it would have more coherence if there were any Republican ideas to challenge liberalism's new cloaking device. Too many Republicans learned the wrong lesson from the 1996 campaign: they envy Clinton his success in disguising himself as a centrist, and they yearn to imitate him. In Washington these days such foolishness passes for deep thinking.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That Clinton now occupies the high ground politically cannot be seriously disputed. The president's Inaugural Address continued the &quot;triangulation&quot; strategy that brought him success in the 1996 presidential campaign against Senator Dole, and we can expect to see that strategy again in his State of the Union speech. Dole never countered it effectively, and most congressional Republicans seem equally impotent.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet the Inaugural speech is also vintage Clinton in taking back with the a wink one moment what he proffered with a smile a moment before. It is in these contradictions and Clinton's hollow tokenism that Republicans should see Clinton's Achilles heel. Behind the cloak of conservative rhetoric beats the heart of a liberal, and no cloaking device can hide that for long.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clinton's faithfulness to core liberal beliefs is clear from a close reading of his Inaugural speech. To serve his ambition to define and occupy the &quot;vital center,&quot; Clinton now seeks to be the champion of &quot;smaller government.&quot; But in what respect smaller? Well, maybe not smaller in every respect, or even in any important respect. He cautions us that &quot;where government can give Americans the power to make a real difference in their daily lives, government should do more.&quot; That small qualification will cover a multitude of new initiatives. He will strive to &quot;give all Americans an opportunity to build better lives.&quot; Thus, neither Clinton nor his liberalism are in retreat; they have merely been enjoying &quot;R and R&quot; and are now ready for renewed battle.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Republicans are beginning to understand that triangulation is not merely a defensive strategy improvised for an election campaign. It has many uses in governance. Clinton will first occupy the muddy middle of American politics, then redefine it in a way that preserves the core programs of Great Society liberalism while also allowing for incremental expansion in education, law enforcement, &quot;health security&quot; and other areas where the public still supports an activist role. This strategy will succeed absent a coherent Republican alternative.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now in control of both houses of Congress for a second consecutive term for the first time in seventy years, Republicans appear to be utterly confused and divided about both principle and program. They await Clinton's State of the Union address in the hope that the president will propose something they can oppose. Then, after a lengthy and honorable debate, they can reach a compromise with Clinton and thus appear statesmanlike.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's a cool thing, this bipartisanship, not as messy and conflict-ridden as the old, uncool ideological politics. The Contract With America was decidedly uncool: it brought confrontation and then defeat in the mismanagement of the budget impasse. If the Contract With America was too risky, a contract with the paymaster is the needed corrective.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where will all this newly acquired coolness leave the Republicans after the dust settles and the Clinton- Gore administration claims credit for whatever compromise legislation is eventually enacted? Do such pale &quot;victories&quot; provide the building blocks for expanding their majority in the 1998 congressional elections? Do they tell the citizens of the nation how a Republican government would differ from the status quo? Will such a me-too strategy give Republicans a platform for recapturing the White House in the year 2000?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are the questions conservatives are asking themselves these days. The answers are not comforting, so some commentators choose to ask only questions that have easier answers. Many otherwise serious analysts trace the current Republican malaise and Clinton's popularity to the strong economy, and they see that as the underlying reason for Dole's defeat. &quot;History was on Clinton's side. What could we do?&quot; By this logic Republicans should pray for a national calamity as the surest road to the White House. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strong economy did not re-elect Bill Clinton, and it will not take a poor one to elect a Republican successor. If such were true, Republicans could pick their presidential nominee by lot, and they could write their next platform by a committee of economists and pollsters. But a party leader and presidential candidate must speak to the great issues confronting the nation, which means he must first see the great issues. They are there, waiting for the political leader who will grasp them and point the way to a recovery of our true greatness.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clinton succeeded-with help from a rudderless Dole campaign-in avoiding those great issues and postponing that needed debate. But his victory may prove hollow if the real divisions afflicting the nation erupt elsewhere in the body politic, as is likely to happen.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clinton's Inaugural Address was mediocre, the symbolism flat, compared to the great inaugural speeches of Washington, Lincoln, FDR, Kennedy and Reagan. That it may nonetheless succeed in its purpose-defining a new center and a new consensus that preserves the liberal welfare state from further erosion-is a sad commentary on the health of the Republican Party.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will take something more than economic determinism to awaken this party from its complacency and drift. That something is called leadership, and it can come only from within the ranks, not from outside. Leadership means direction, and direction requires purpose. At this moment, the Republican party doesn't have one, other than the desire to avoid another budget fiasco. The goals of &quot;expanding the base of the party&quot; and &quot;reaching out to new voters&quot; are laudable, but they are means, not ends. Will these new recruits not want to know where the party intends to take them?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The man who summons the Republican party to a higher purpose, as Lincoln did in championing the exclusion of slavery from new states and territories, will become its leader. And he will have a fair chance of becoming the next president-even without a stock market crash.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTION</P>
</B><P>On November 5, 1996, the California electorate adopted Proposition 209, otherwise known as the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), by a margin of 54-46 percent.  For the purposes of the present paper, the key provisions of Proposition 209, which now comprises Article I, Section 31 of the state constitution, are as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

</FONT><P>Prop. 209: <FONT SIZE=3> (a)  The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * </P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P> (f)  For the purposes of this section, &quot;state&quot; shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the state itself, any city, county, city and county, public university system, including the University of California, community college district, school district, special district, or any other political subdivision or governmental instrumentality of or within the state.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Roman"><P>In an article in the <I>Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly</I>, Vol. 23:4, Summer 1996, pp. 1-39 (&quot;Equal Protection, Unequal Political Burdens, and the CCRI&quot;), Vikram D. Amar and Evan H. Caminker argue that lower courts, at least, must hold Proposition 209 unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court precedent <I>Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1</I> (1982), 458 U.S. 457. </P>
<P>&#9;The present paper is a response to Amar and Caminker. It is argued in this paper that under the <I>Seattle</I> precedent it is not unconstitutional for a state to use a political decisionmaking process (in this case, a statewide initiative) to constitutionalize a prohibition against race-conscious measures, even if the adoption of that policy change makes it more difficult than before for minorities to obtain legislation at lower levels of government that the Court might deem to be in their interest.  According to the analysis provided here, the <I>Seattle</I> ruling invalidates only those enactments that meet both of the following criteria: (1) the enactment addresses a racial matter; and (2) it <I>explicitly</I> alters a political decisionmaking process on that racial matter in a way that places a special burden on minorities.</P>
<P>The paper discusses <I>Crawford v. Board of Education</I> (1982), 458 U.S. 527, and finds important corroborating evidence for its analysis of <I>Seattle</I> in that decision.  It also criticizes the Amar-Caminker interpretation of <I>Seattle </I>on the grounds that it necessarily implies that minorities have political rights under the Fourteenth Amendment that the majority does not have.  The Amar-Caminker interpretation is also criticized on the grounds that it cannot be reconciled with the <I>Seattle </I>Court's clear and explicit statement that states do have the right under the federal constitution to establish race-neutral policies on racial questions.  The recent analysis of <I>Seattle </I>by U.S. District Court Judge Thelton H. Henderson, which is very similar to the Amar-Caminker interpretation and which may very well have been inspired by it, is criticized on similar grounds.<SUP>1</P>
</SUP><I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">WASHINGTON v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1</I> (1982), 458 U.S. 457</P>
</B><P>In 1978, the Seattle School District adopted a desegregation plan that made extensive use of mandatory busing.  Subsequently, a group of citizens in Seattle drafted a statewide ballot measure (Initiative 350) which, they hoped, would result in the termination of the Seattle busing plan, and of racial busing in the State of Washington generally.  The key provision of the measure read as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Init. 350: </FONT><FONT FACE="Roman" SIZE=3>Be it enacted by the People of the State of Washington:</P>
<P>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, after the effective date of this act no school board, school district, educational service district board, educational service district, or county committee, nor the superintendent of public instruction, nor the state board of education, nor any of their respective employees, agents or delegates shall directly or indirectly require any student to attend a school other than the school which is geographically nearest or next nearest the student's place of residence within the school district of his or her residence and which offers the course of study pursued by such student ...</FONT><FONT FACE="Roman">.<SUP>2</SUP><I> </P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

</I><P>In addition, the measure set out a number of broad exceptions to this requirement.  As qualified by the exceptions, the prohibition had the effect of permitting mandatory busing for every purpose <I>other</I> than that of racial balancing or integration of the schools.  The measure also proscribed the use of seven enumerated methods of indirect student assignment-among them the redefinition of attendance zones, the pairing of schools, and the use of &quot;feeder&quot; schools-which had figured in the Seattle plan. The initiative permitted racial busing in only one circumstance: it did not purport to &quot;prevent any court of competent jurisdiction from adjudicating constitutional issues relating to the public schools.&quot;<SUP>3</P>
</SUP><P>&#9;There are a couple of rather obvious differences between Proposition 209 and Initiative 350 that will figure prominently in the following discussion.</P>
<P>&#9;First, Initiative 350 did not establish a statewide policy prohibiting mandatory racial busing, and as the <I>Seattle</I> Court itself noted, it left the state legislature free to order such busing.<SUP>4</SUP>  Clearly, a measure that allows the state legislature to order mandatory racial busing fails to establish a policy against such busing.  In this respect, Initiative 350 is clearly different from Proposition 209, which is a pure policy enactment.</P>
<P>&#9;Second, Initiative 350 effectively eliminated mandatory racial busing in the State of Washington by working an explicit change in the state's political decisionmaking process--and in particular, by removing decisionmaking authority over mandatory racial busing from local school boards.  In this respect, too, it differs from Proposition 209, which has no language that alters California's political decisionmaking process in an analogous way.</P>
<P>&#9;In 1982, the <I>Seattle </I>Court held, 5 to 4, that Initiative 350 altered the political decisionmaking process in Washington State on a specifically racial question in a way that placed special burdens on minorities in that political process, and that Initiative 350 therefore violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.<SUP>5</SUP>  The problem before us is to understand this ruling and its implications, if any, for the adjudication of the constitutionality of California's Proposition 209. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">A DIVIDED COURT</P>
</B><P>&#9;To answer this question, it is necessary to ask whether the <I>Seattle</I> ruling entails that a policy enactment on a racial question by a higher level of government prohibiting race-conscious measures that are arguably in the interest of minorities violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  On this fundamental point, a minority of the <I>Seattle </I>Court thought it did (or might), but the Court itself did not.</P>
<P>According to Justice Powell, who wrote the minority opinion in <I>Seattle, </I>the Court's invalidation of Initiative 350 had arguably committed the Court to the following positions, which he clearly regarded as not merely untenable, but absurd:</P>
<P>&#9;(1)&#9;That the adoption of a neighborhood school policy by a local school board is permissible under the federal constitution, but that the adoption of such a policy at the <I>state</I> level violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  458 U.S. 488-489.</P>
<P>&#9;(2)&#9;That while it would be constitutionally permissible for the Seattle School District to change its mind and cancel its program of mandatory racial busing of its own volition, neither the state legislature nor the people of the State of Washington could alter what the District had decided.  458 U.S. 494.</P>
<P>&#9;(3)&#9;That the ruling barred the Supreme Court of the State of Washington from interpreting a provision of its state constitution to prohibit race-conscious school assignments, despite the fact that such a prohibition would be a facially tenable construction of that provision.  458 U.S.  499, fn. 15.<SUP>6</P>
</SUP><P>&#9;(4)&#9;That in its ruling the Court was reversing its prior dictum in <I>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</I> (1978) that &quot;in the absence of a federal constitutional violation <I>requiring</I> [emphasis in original] race-specific remedies, a policy of strict racial neutrality by a State would violate no federal principle.&quot;  458 U.S. 491.<SUP>7</P>
</SUP><P>&#9;The passage in Powell's dissent to which the <I>Seattle </I>Court responded most directly was the following one:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Roman" SIZE=3><P>Under [the Court's] holding the people of the State of Washington apparently are forever barred from developing a different <I>policy</I> [emphasis added] on mandatory busing where a school district previously has adopted one of its own.  This principle would not seem limited to the question of mandatory busing.  Thus, if the admissions committee of a state law school developed an affirmative-action plan that came under fire, the Court apparently would find it unconstitutional for any higher authority to intervene unless that authority traditionally dictated admissions policies...After today's decision it is unclear whether the State may <I>set policy</I> [emphasis added] in any area where a local governmental body arguably has done &quot;more&quot; than the Fourteenth Amendment requires.  If local employment or benefits are distributed on a racial basis to the benefit of racial minorities, the State apparently may not thereafter ever intervene.  Indeed, under the Court's theory one must wonder whether-under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment-even the Federal Government could assert its superior authority to regulate in these areas.</FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Roman">8</P></SUP></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Significantly, the Court itself <I>denied</I> that its ruling had these implications. In a direct reply to the above passage, the <I>Seattle</I> Court said:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P><A NAME="footnote_23_at_480">Fn. 23 at 480:</A> Throughout his dissent, Justice POWELL insists that the Court has created a &quot;vested constitutional right to local decisionmaking,&quot; ... that under our holding &quot;the people of the State of Washington apparently are forever barred from developing a different <I>policy</I> [emphasis added] on mandatory busing where a school district previously has adopted one of its own,&quot; ... and that today's decision somehow raises doubts about &quot;the authority of a State to abolish school boards altogether.&quot;  ... These statements evidence a basic misunderstanding of our decision<I>.  Our analysis vests no rights</I> [emphasis added], and has nothing to do with whether school board action predates that taken by the State.  Instead, what we find objectionable about Initiative 350 is the comparative burden it imposes on minority participation in the political process-that is, the racial nature of the way in which it structures the <I>process</I> [emphasis in original] of decisionmaking.  It is evident, then, that the horribles paraded by the dissent ... --which have nothing to do with the ability of minorities to participate in the process of self-government-are entirely unrelated to this case.  It is equally clear, as we have noted at several points in our opinion, that the State remains free to vest all decisionmaking power in state officials, or to remove authority from local school boards in a race-neutral manner.<SUP>9</SUP></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</P>
<P>There is no way to read this passage except as a statement that the people of a state are <I>not</I> forever barred from developing a different policy on mandatory busing where a school district previously has adopted such a policy; that a higher governmental authority <I>may</I> intervene to overturn an affirmative action plan that has been approved by the admissions committee of a law school; that a state <I>may</I> set policy in an area where a local governmental body arguably has done &quot;more&quot; than the Fourteenth Amendment requires; etc.  Whatever the <I>Seattle</I>ruling means, therefore, it cannot mean that the people of a state are barred from constitutionalizing a prohibition against discrimination and preferences on the basis of race, sex, or ethnicity, as the people of California did when they adopted Proposition 209.</P>
<P>&#9;As will be argued at some length in the following sections of this paper, the key to interpreting <I>Seattle </I>is simply the distinction between (1) using a political decisionmaking process (such as a statewide ballot procedure) to adopt a policy bearing on a racial matter at a higher level of government, and (2) explicitly altering a decisionmaking process in a way that places a special burden on minorities on a specifically racial question.  It is the contention of this paper that the only possible way to interpret the Court's ruling in <I>Seattle</I> is to construe it as upholding the constitutionality of measures that fit the description in (1) above, even when the policy that has been adopted at a higher level of government makes it more difficult for minorities to obtain legislation that the Court might deem to be in their interest.  </P>
<P>It is evident that there must be a distinction between (1) and (2) above, for if the phrase &quot;alters the political decisionmaking process&quot; is to have any clear meaning, it cannot mean that a decisionmaking process is altered any time a policy is adopted at a higher level of government that precludes contrary policies at lower levels of government.  And if this is not what the phrase can mean generally, it cannot be taken to be the meaning of the phrase in the Court's <I>Seattle</I> decision. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">THE <I>HUNTER</I> AND <I>REITMAN</I> PRECEDENTS</P>
</B><P>Two earlier Court cases, <I>Reitman v. Mulkey</I> (1967) and <I>Hunter v. Erickson</I> (1969), illuminate the Court's hostility to explicit alterations of the political decisionmaking process on specifically racial questions.</P>
<P>&#9;In 1964, the city council in Akron, Ohio enacted a fair housing ordinance and established a Commission on Equal Opportunity in Housing to enforce its provisions.  Subsequently, the Akron electorate amended the city charter by a citywide ballot initiative as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>A.C.C. 137:&#9;</FONT><FONT FACE="Roman" SIZE=3>Any ordinance enacted by the Council of The City of Akron which regulates the use, sale, advertisement, transfer, listing assignment, lease, sublease or financing of real property of any kind or of any interest therein on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin or ancestry must first be approved by a majority of the electors voting on the question at a regular or general election before said ordinance shall be effective.  Any such ordinance in effect at the time of the adoption of this section shall cease to be effective until approved by the electors as provided herein.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The Akron city charter amendment essentially did two things. First, it repealed any housing ordinance regulating real estate transactions in the city on the basis of race and other factors that had previously been enacted by the city council.  Secondly, it required any future housing ordinance bearing on a racial question to be ratified by a majority of the city's voters in a general election.</P>
<P>It is important to note that Akron City Charter  137 did not establish a <I>right</I> to discriminate on the basis of race and other factors in private real estate transactions in the city of Akron.  Furthermore, in the campaign for the city charter amendment, and when defending the amendment in court, the measure's proponents and the city of Akron never said that they favored a policy establishing a right to discriminate in private real estate transactions.  They defended the measure instead on the grounds that any measure on this question was important enough to be submitted to the citywide electorate.<SUP>10</SUP> If the citizens of Akron <I>had</I> wanted to adopt a policy establishing a right to discriminate, moreover, they would have been barred from doing so by the Court's 1969 decision in <I>Reitman v. Mulkey</I>, where the Court struck down Proposition 14, a constitutional amendment which the people of the State of California had adopted in 1964.  This amendment provided in relevant part:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Prop. 14: Neither the State nor any subdivision or agency thereof shall deny, limit or abridge, directly or indirectly, the right of any person, who is willing or desires to sell, lease or rent any part or all of his real property, to decline to sell, lease or rent such property to such person or persons as he, in his absolute discretion, chooses.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;It is clear from the Fourteenth Amendment that a state cannot discriminate on the basis of race in its own real estate or any other transactions.  The question presented in <I>Reitman</I>, however, was the question whether the people of a state could constitutionalize a right to discriminate on the basis of race in <I>private</I> real estate transactions.  The <I>Reitman</I> Court held, 5 to 4, that Proposition 14 went beyond a position of neutrality with regard to private discriminations, and that by establishing a state right to privately discriminate it &quot;encouraged&quot; and &quot;authorized&quot; private discrimination.  The Court held that this involved the state in racial discrimination and hence was invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment.</P>
<P>If the people of the city of Akron <I>had</I> wanted to reserve to themselves the right to discriminate on the basis of race in private real estate transactions, therefore, the way would have been barred by the Court's prior ruling in <I>Reitman</I>. What the voters of Akron did instead was to strike down the city council's prior fair housing ordinances, and then to require in addition that all future housing ordinances bearing on race and certain other factors be submitted to a citywide referendum.  But even this measure was struck down by the Court, on the grounds that it singled out racial matters for special treatment and altered the political decisionmaking process in a way that placed special burdens on minority interests.</P>
<P>Note that the Court did not hold in <I>Hunter</I> that any policy bearing on a racial question that makes it more difficult for minorities to obtain legislation that is arguably in their interest is unconstitutional.  <I>Hunter </I>could not present this question, since the Akron city charter amendment repealed a fair housing ordinance, and the Court had already held in <I>Reitman </I>that laws establishing a <I>right</I> to discriminate in private transactions are unconstitutional.<SUP>11</P>
</SUP><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="CENTER">SEATTLE</I> IN THE LIGHT OF THE <I>HUNTER</I> AND <I>REITMAN</I> PRECEDENTS</P>
</B><P>The Court's opinion in <I>Seattle </I>rests squarely on its prior ruling in <I>Hunter</I>.  The analysis has the following form: (1) Initiative 350 is like Akron City Charter  137 in all constitutionally relevant respects; (2) the <I>Hunter </I>Court held Akron City Charter  137 unconstitutional; therefore (3) Initiative 350 is unconstitutional.<SUP>12</SUP>  To understand <I>Seattle</I>, therefore, it is essential to understand why the Court felt that Initiative 350 presented exactly the same constitutional issue that the Akron city charter amendment had presented to the <I>Hunter </I>Court.</P>
<P> Without taking a position on racial discrimination in private real estate transactions (Akron City Charter  137), or the merits of mandatory racial busing (Initiative 350), the electorate in these two ballot measures had explicitly altered the established political decisionmaking structure and placed decisionmaking power over a racial issue at a higher level of government.  Both measures were deemed by the Court to be violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.  But the Court did not say in either case-and in <I>Seattle</I> explicitly denied-that states have no power to establish a <I>policy</I> on a racial question that makes it more difficult for minorities to obtain legislation the Court might deem to be in their interest.  We have also seen that there are a priori reasons for <I>not </I>interpreting the phrase &quot;alters the political decisionmaking structure&quot; so broadly that it covers policies, adopted at a higher level of government, which make it more difficult for certain individuals or groups to obtain legislation at lower levels of government that is arguably in their interest.</P>
<P>&#9;The following principle HD summarizes these findings about the <I>Hunter </I>doctrine:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>HD: A measure that addresses a racial question, and which explicitly and directly alters the political decisionmaking structure on that question in a way that places special burdens on racial minorities, offends the Fourteenth Amendment. Measures that offend the Fourteenth Amendment in this way include, but are not necessarily limited to, explicit alterations in the political decisionmaking structure that place decisionmaking authority over a specifically racial question at a higher and more remote level of government.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The following principle HD&#180; states what the <I>Hunter</I> doctrine does <I>not</I>prohibit:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P> HD&#180;:&#9;A policy measure that is adopted at a higher level of government through the use of an existing decisionmaking structure does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, even if such a measure make its more difficult for minorities to obtain legislation that the Court might deem to be in their interest (provided, of course, that the measure itself is constitutionally permissible in all other respects).  When a higher level of government adopts such a measure, it is not altering the political decisionmaking structure in a way that violates the <I>Hunter</I> doctrine, but is simply exerting the power which it inherently has to establish any policies, including those bearing on specifically racial questions, that are not prohibited by the federal constitution.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Much if not most of the controversy between the Court and the minority justices in <I>Seattle</I> was on the question whether Initiative 350 violated the <I>Hunter</I> doctrine.  Justice Blackmun, writing for the Court, said that it did; Justice Powell, writing for the minority, said that it didn't.  On this particular point, Blackmun was clearly right, and Powell was clearly wrong.  The Court had no difficulty in showing, for example, that in Washington State decisionmaking authority over racial busing had generally been placed, at least as a matter of practice, in local school boards before the adoption of Initiative 350.  Given this well-established fact, it is obvious from inspection that Initiative 350 violated the <I>Hunter</I>doctrine as formulated in HD above, for it explicitly denied to local school boards decisionmaking authority over a racial question which school boards had previously held.  It was also a <I>non sequitur</I> for Justice Powell to suggest that the Court's holding in <I>Seattle</I> entailed that henceforth no state would be allowed to develop &quot;a different policy on mandatory busing where a school district previously has adopted one of its own,&quot; for Initiative 350 did not establish a policy on racial busing, nor did the Court's analysis imply that it had.</P>
<P>Since Initiative 350 possessed the very features which the <I>Hunter </I>Court had declared unconstitutional in the Akron city charter amendment, the minority justices in <I>Seattle</I> either had to join with the majority in striking down Initiative 350, or they had to qualify the <I>Hunter</I> doctrine, as formulated in HD above.  As it turns out, they did neither--hence the weakness of Powell's dissent.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, it is one thing to claim that Initiative 350 altered the political decisionmaking process on a racial question in the same way that Akron City Charter  137 had done, and quite another to hold that Initiative 350 was unconstitutional on those grounds.  What may well have been haunting the Court in <I>Hunter</I> was the fear that with City Charter  137 the citizens of Akron had achieved by indirect means what the people of the state of California had tried to achieve with Proposition 14.  This would be a legitimate concern for the Court, for the Court had already held Proposition 14 unconstitutional in <I>Reitman</I>.  But the situation was quite different in <I>Seattle</I>, for the Court had never held (and has not held since) that a prohibition against racial busing for the purposes of remedying<I> de facto</I> segregation is per se a violation of the federal constitution.  This suggests that HD may be overbroad, and that what the Court should have done in the face of Initiative 350 is to qualify and reformulate it.</P>
<P>One possibility might be to amend HD to permit explicit alterations of the political decisionmaking structure on a racial question if, but only if, in addition to repealing existing legislation on a racial question, the higher governmental authority could have prohibited all <I>future</I> measures similar to the ones that it repealed.</P>
<P>But there are problems even with this amended rule.  Suppose, for example, that the people of the state of Washington had passed a ballot measure that removed authority to order racial busing from local school boards, and in addition imposed a supermajority requirement for the enactment of mandatory racial busing measures, whether by the state legislature or by statewide initiative.  Such a measure would satisfy the suggested amended rule (because a policy prohibiting racial busing is not itself unconstitutional), but would clearly have been struck down by the <I>Seattle </I>Court, for it is one thing to grant a higher level of government--and only that level of government--decisionmaking authority on a racial question, and quite another to do that and <I>also</I> to place a supermajority requirement on the enactment of future legislation bearing on that question.  That is precisely the kind of alteration of the political decisionmaking process that the Court regarded as unconstitutional in <I>Hunter</I>.<SUP>13</P>
</SUP><P>&#9;Consequently, the amended rule would require further refinement.  But in any case it does not require refinement in order to bar Initiative 350, for that measure was innocuous in this respect: it did place decisionmaking authority over a racial matter at a higher level of government, but racial busing as a cure for <I>de facto </I>segregation is not required by the federal constitution, and the measure did not otherwise explicitly alter the political decisionmaking process.  Indeed, Initiative 350 was less far-reaching than a <I>policy</I> prohibiting mandatory racial busing would have been, for it left decisionmaking authority over such busing to the state legislature and to future ballot initiatives.  Nevertheless, the <I>Seattle</I> Court struck down Initiative 350, while its dicta in footnote 23 at 480 acknowledge that a policy prohibiting non-federally-required racial busing <I>would</I> have been constitutional.  While this is not an untenable result, it is an odd one.  It certainly suggests that it would have been in order for the Court to consider modifications of the doctrine enunciated in <I>Hunter </I>in order to avoid such paradoxical consequences.</P>
<P>The minority chose to argue instead that Initiative 350 did not violate the <I>Hunter</I> doctrine--a manifestly untenable claim.  The result was that the Court held, in effect, that even a measure like Initiative 350 <I>must conform to the strict letter of HD without qualification</I>--even though in its own opinion the <I>Seattle</I> Court declared that a measure embodying the policy choice which Initiative 350 simply left to the discretion of  the state legislature (i.e., a ban on racial busing to remedy <I>de facto</I> segregation) <I>would</I> have been constitutional had the electorate adopted that measure instead.</P>

</B></I><P>For the reasons given, Initiative 350 did not present the Court with a policy enactment by a higher level of government that made it more difficult for racial minorities to obtain race-conscious legislation at lower levels of government that the Court might deem to be in their interest.  Nevertheless, Amar and Caminker have argued that <I>Seattle</I> stands for the proposition that a measure like Proposition 209 is unconstitutional.<SUP>14</SUP>  Quite unaccountably, however, they never once mention that in footnote 23 at 480 the <I>Seattle </I>Court specifically <I>denied</I> that its ruling precluded a state from adopting a different policy on mandatory busing where a school district previously had adopted one of its own.</P>
<P>Amar and Caminker do cite part of the crucial footnote 23 at 480, as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>...<I>see also Seattle</I>, 458 U.S. at 480 n. 23 (&quot;[T]he State remains free to vest all decisionmaking power in state officials, or to remove authority from local school boards in a race-neutral manner. . . . [W]hat we find objectionable about Initiative 350 is the <I>comparative</I> burden it imposes on minority participation in the political process . . . .&quot;) (emphasis added).<SUP>15</SUP></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</p>
<P>This partial citation of footnote 23 omits to mention that the footnote explicitly denies that the Court has created a &quot;vested constitutional right to local decisionmaking,&quot; or that it means that &quot;the people of the State of Washington apparently are forever barred from developing a different policy on mandatory busing where a school district previously has adopted one of its own.&quot;  Since Amar and Caminker never cite this part of the footnote, they never explicitly address the problem that such statements present to their interpretation of <I>Seattle</I>.  But the burden of their argument and partial citation of footnote 23 is clear enough.  On their view, the fact that the people of a state can adopt a different policy on mandatory busing where a school district previously has acted first means that they may do so <I>if and only if </I>they develop a policy on every <I>other</I> matter involving school transportation and school assignments, whether racial or non-racial.</P>
<P>Their interpretation is untenable, for several reasons.</P>
<P>First, as a purely textual point, the authors have reversed the order of the two sentences which they do cite from the footnote, and have omitted the qualifying phrase &quot;It is equally clear that...&quot; from the concluding sentence of the footnote.  That sentence reads in full:  &quot;It is equally clear, as we have noted at several points in our opinion, that the State remains free to vest all decisionmaking power in state officials, or to remove authority from local school boards in a race-neutral manner.&quot;<SUP>16</SUP> This qualifying phrase clearly implies that the points that follow cannot be regarded as providing the rationale for the statement that a state is permitted to adopt a policy on mandatory busing where a local school board has acted first.  In view of the qualification, the last sentence of the footnote can only be read as raising points that are separate from, and additional to, the points raised earlier in the footnote.</P>
<P>Second, the partial citation of footnote 23 by Amar and Caminker gives only the first half of the sentence that begins, &quot;Instead, what we find objectionable about Initiative 350 is the comparative burden it imposes on minority participation in the political process....&quot;  The second half of the sentence, which is omitted, says: &quot;that is, the racial nature of the way in which it structures the <I>process</I> of decisionmaking.&quot;  As it does elsewhere, the Court in this passage stresses the fact that Initiative 350 explicitly and on its face altered the political decisionmaking process.  This repeated emphasis cuts against the Amar-Caminker interpretation of <I>Seattle</I>, for according to their interpretation, this feature of Initiative 350 was ultimately of no importance to the Court.</P>
<P>Third, as a purely linguistic matter, theirs is simply not a natural or plausible reading of the statements in question.  If X is asked if Y has the authority to adopt a policy on a particular subject-matter, and the reply is that Y does have this authority, it is unnatural to interpret that affirmative answer to mean that Y may do so <I>if but only if</I> Y also reserves to himself decisionmaking authority on all <I>other</I> matters.</P>
<P>Fourth, the interpretation could be taken seriously only if the condition that it lays down could be met in the real world--and it obviously couldn't be.  While it might be possible for the people of a state to adopt a statewide measure that deals with the full range of policy choices that might arise in a very restricted domain, they clearly could not do so for a very broad range of governmental action.</P>
<P>Take, for example, the three very broad areas of governmental action covered by Proposition 209: public employment, public education, and public contracting.  According to the Amar-Caminker interpretation of <I>Seattle</I>, the only reason why the people of the State of California are not barred from constitutionalizing a prohibition against racial preferences in all three of these areas of governmental action is that the people of the state are not barred from taking <I>all</I> matters into their hands in these areas.  But it is ludicrous to imply, as this constitutional doctrine does, that the people of California could run all the affairs of the state (or at least withdraw all legislative and policy-setting authority at every level of state government to themselves) through the constitutional amendment process.  To take only one of the three areas covered by Proposition 209 as an example: the people of a state could not, as a practical matter, decide in their constitution all questions about overtime, compensation, pension plans, occupational safety standards and all other matters involving public employment.<SUP>17</SUP>  And if the Amar-Caminker interpretation of <I>Seattle</I> is untenable when applied to a state constitution, it must be rejected for all levels of government, for if it fails to provide an interpretation of <I>Seattle</I> when that precedent is applied to a state constitution, it fails to provide an interpretation of <A NAME="amarcaminker_end">footnote 23 of the <I>Seattle </I>opinion that is of general applicability</A>.<SUP>18</P>
</SUP><P>Although their implicit analysis of footnote 23 at 480 is clearly inadequate, Amar and Caminker do acknowledge that drawing a distinction between using an existing political decisionmaking process to enact a policy change on a racial matter at the highest level of government, on the one hand, and explicitly altering that decisionmaking process on the other, offers an initially plausible, prima facie basis for interpreting <I>Seattle</I>.<SUP>19</SUP>  They contend, however, that there is evidence within the <I>Seattle</I> opinion that the Court regarded the substance/procedure distinction as vague and unimportant constitutionally.  But the passage they cite in support of this assertion, which is given below, is not on point:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Justice POWELL finds <I>Hunter</I> completely irrelevant, dismissing it with the conclusory statement that &quot;the political system has <I>not</I> been redrawn or altered.&quot;  <I>Post</I>, at 497-498.  The evil condemned by the <I>Hunter</I> Court was not the particular political obstacle of mandatory referenda imposed by the Akron charter amendment; it was, rather, the comparative structural burden placed on the political achievement of minority interests.  Thus, in <I>Hunter</I>, the procedures for enacting racial legislation were modified in such a way as to place effective control in the hands of the citywide electorate.  Similarly here, the power to enact racial legislation has been reallocated.  In each case, the effect of the challenged action was to redraw decisionmaking authority over racial matters-and only over racial matters-in such a way as to place comparative burdens on minorities.  While Justice POWELL and the United States find it crucial that the proponents of integrated schools remain free to use Washington's initiative system to further their ends, that was true in <I>Hunter</I> as well: proponents of open housing were not barred from invoking Akron's initiative procedures to repeal the charter amendment, or to enact fair housing legislation of their own.  It is surely an excessive formal exercise, then, to argue that the procedural revisions at issue in <I>Hunter</I> imposed special burdens on minorities, but that the selective allocation of decisionmaking authority worked by Initiative 350 does not erect comparable political obstacles.  Indeed, <I>Hunter</I> would have been virtually identical to this case had the Akron city charter amendment simply barred the City Council from passing any fair housing ordinance, as Initiative 350 forbids the use of all mandatory desegregation strategies.  Surely, however, <I>Hunter</I> would not have come out the other way had the charter amendment made <I>no</I> provision for the passage of fair housing legislation, instead of subjecting such legislation to ratification by referendum.<SUP>20</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

</SUP><P>It is hard to understand why Amar and Caminker regard this passage as evidence that the <I>Seattle</I> Court regarded the &quot;substance/procedure&quot; distinction as unimportant constitutionally.  On the contrary, the point of the passage is to show, <I>contra</I> Justice Powell, that Initiative 350 was in all constitutionally relevant respects exactly like Akron City Charter  137--and as we have seen, neither Initiative 350 nor the Akron city charter amendment was a policy enactment.</P>
<P>&#9;The passage is a direct response to Powell's allegation (1) that &quot;Nothing in <I>Hunter</I> supports the Court's extraordinary invasion into the State's distribution of authority;&quot; (2) that &quot;In this case, unlike in <I>Hunter</I>, the political system has not been redrawn or altered;&quot; and (3) that &quot;<I>Hunter</I>, therefore, is simply irrelevant.&quot;<SUP>21</SUP>  Blackmun has no difficulty showing that these claims are mistaken.  He begins by pointing out that Initiative 350 worked its changes precisely by altering the then-existing political decisionmaking structure.  Before the adoption of Initiative 350, decisions about racial busing were made by local schoolboards in Washington State; after the adoption of Initiative 350, only the state legislature and the people of the State of Washington had this power.  Likewise, in <I>Hunter, </I>he says, &quot;the procedures for enacting racial legislation were modified in such a way as to place effective control in the hands of the citywide electorate.&quot;  The effect in each case, he adds, is to &quot;redraw decisionmaking authority over racial matters.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;In addition, Blackmun has no difficulty dispensing with Powell's claim that Initiative 350 differed constitutionally from Akron City Charter  137 on the grounds that proponents of mandatory racial busing in Washington State could use the initiative process to overturn Initiative 350 and obtain race-conscious legislation they deemed to be in their interest even after its adoption.  Blackmun replied that this did not distinguish Initiative 350 from the Akron city charter amendment, because the same was true of minority citizens seeking fair housing legislation after the adoption of Akron City Charter  137.</P>
<P>Indeed, if one ignores the fact (as Blackmun did in the above passage) that Initiative 350 left the <I>state</I> <I>legislature </I>free to order mandatory racial busing, and focuses solely on Initiative 350's effect on local school boards, the burden that Initiative 350 placed on the interests of minorities in Washington State was actually <I>greater</I> than the burden the Akron city charter amendment had placed on the interests of minorities in the city of Akron.  That is because Akron City Charter  137 established a two-step decisionmaking structure on housing ordinances involving racial issues.  It left the city council with the power to draft and propose housing ordinances involving racial questions, but left decisionmaking authority over such measures with the citywide electorate, which either adopted them or rejected them by majority vote.  (Alternatively, citizens could place such measures on the citywide ballot directly by gathering petition signatures from 10 percent of the citywide electorate.)  To get an exact analogy between the Akron city charter provision and Initiative 350, therefore, one would have to suppose that Akron City Charter  137 had removed even the drafting and proposing powers from the city council, just as, the Court argued, Initiative 350 had completely removed <I>all</I> power over racial busing from the local school boards.  But as Blackmun pointed out, this would have made Akron City Charter  137 even more vulnerable to attack under the <I>Hunter</I> doctrine, for that would have left the city council with <I>no</I> authority over such matters.</P>
<P>&#9;Since neither Initiative 350 nor Akron City Charter  137 involved a policy enactment on a racial question, the passage cited by Amar and Caminker cannot be taken as undermining the &quot;substance/procedure&quot; distinction-all the more so, since the Court explicitly <I>denied</I> that its ruling in <I>Seattle</I> barred such policy enactments in footnote 23 at 480.  The above passage is limited to arguing (quite correctly) that no matter how it is viewed, Initiative 350 is exactly like Akron City Charter  137 in all the respects that matter under the <I>Hunter</I> doctrine.</P>

<B><I><P ALIGN="CENTER">CrawforD v. Board of Education</I> (1982), 458 U.S. 527</P>
</B><P>There are additional reasons for rejecting the Amar-Caminker interpretation of the <I>Hunter </I>doctrine in an opinion that the <I>Seattle </I>Court delivered on the same day, <I>Crawford v. Board of Education</I> (1982), 458 U.S. 527.</P>
<P>Prior to Proposition I, a statewide constitutional amendment by initiative that was adopted by the California electorate in 1970, California courts had interpreted the equal protection clause of the California constitution to require the state to remedy <I>de facto</I> as well as <I>de jure</I> segregation in its public schools.  State courts had accordingly ordered racial busing in some instances where they would have had no authority to do so under the federal constitution.</P>
<P>Proposition I added a lengthy proviso to Article I, Section 7(a) of the California state constitution to prohibit such court-ordered busing.  Following passage of Proposition I, this section of the state constitution now provides in relevant part:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Prop. I: (a) [1]  A person may not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law or denied equal protection of the laws;<I> </I>[2]<I> provided, that nothing contained herein or elsewhere in this Constitution imposes upon the State of California or any public entity board, or official any obligations or responsibilities which exceed those imposed by the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution with respect to the use of pupil assignment or pupil transportation. </I> [3]<I> In enforcing this subdivision or any other provision of this Constitution, no court of this state may impose upon the State of California or any public entity, board or official an obligation or responsibility with respect to the use of pupil school assignment or pupil transportation, (1) except to remedy a specific violation by such party that would also constitute a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, and (2) unless a federal court would be permitted under federal decisional law to impose that obligation or responsibility upon such party to remedy the specific violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">* * *</P>
<P>[4]<I>  Nothing herein shall prohibit the governing board of a school district from voluntarily continuing or commencing a school integration plan after the effective date of this subdivision as amended.</I><SUP>22</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

</SUP><P>The Court upheld the constitutionality of Proposition I, 8 to 1.</P>
<P>If one looked only at [3] above, this might seem surprising, since [3] has exactly the same form as Initiative 350, which the Court struck down the same day in its <I>Seattle</I> decision--i.e., it says &quot;[N]o court of this state shall order...,&quot; just as Initiative 350 said, in effect, &quot;No local school board shall order...&quot; etc.  But [3] cannot be considered in isolation, for it is in fact a mere corollary of [2].  Before the adoption of Proposition I, state courts had interpreted the Equal Protection clause of the state constitution to require the State of California to take race-conscious measures that went beyond anything required by the federal constitution.  Proposition I repealed that interpretation of the state constitution, and thereby brought the California constitution into conformity with the federal constitution on this particular question in every respect.  Thus, state courts could not enforce non-federally-required racial busing after the adoption of Proposition I, because the corresponding right on which such court-ordered busing had been based had been repealed.</P>
<P>This is exactly the point made by Justices Blackmun and Brennan in their concurring opinion in <I>Crawford</I>:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>State courts do not create the rights they enforce; those rights originate elsewhere-in the state legislature, in the State's political subdivisions, or in the state constitution itself.  When one of those rights is repealed, and therefore is rendered unenforceable in the courts, that action hardly can be said to restructure the State's decisionmaking mechanism.  While the California electorate may have made it more difficult to achieve desegregation when it enacted Proposition I, to my mind it did so not by working a structural change in the political <I>process </I>so much as by simply repealing the right to invoke a judicial busing remedy....<SUP>23</SUP></P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Understandably enough, Amar and Caminker regard <I>Crawford</I> as a potential threat to their interpretation of the <I>Hunter</I> doctrine.  They attempt to meet this threat by arguing that the <I>Crawford</I> Court regarded it as an <I>essential </I>aspect of Proposition I that it did not limit the discretion of lower levels of government in California to order racial busing, and that Proposition I was therefore a &quot;mere repeal.&quot;  If it had not been a mere repeal, they argue, the <I>Crawford</I> Court would presumably have struck it down:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Superficially, <I>Crawford </I>seems to establish some limiting principle to the reach of the <I>Hunter</I> doctrine, one that might appear to save the CCRI because it, like Proposition I, is a constitutional amendment that is (arguably) packaged as a substantive policy change rather than an alteration of political process.   On closer examination, however, <I>Crawford </I>represents an unexceptional application of the &quot;mere repeal&quot; rule.  Proposition I simply worked a repeal, <I>by the enacting entity </I>[emphasis in the original], of a substantive constitutional norm favorable to racial minorities.  It did not, by word or effect, withdraw pre-existing or future political authority from lower levels of government.<SUP>24</SUP></P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>It is true that Proposition I explicitly leaves the power to order racial busing with local school boards (cf. clause [4] of the citation of Proposition I above), and it is also true that at several places in its opinion the <I>Crawford</I> Court refers to that particular feature of Proposition I.  But there is no passage in the <I>Crawford </I>opinion that says or implies that the Court regarded this as an <I>essential </I>aspect of Proposition I-i.e., one that no similar measure could omit and still be declared constitutional under the <I>Hunter</I>doctrine.</P>
<P>Not only is there no evidence that the <I>Crawford </I>Court regarded this aspect of Proposition I as essential to a determination of its constitutionality: there are, in addition, compelling affirmative reasons for thinking that the <I>Crawford </I>Court did <I>not </I>view the matter this way. There is, first of all, the fundamental fact that in footnote 23 at 480 of its <I>Seattle </I>opinion, the Court explicitly denied that the <I>Hunter </I>doctrine vested rights to decide racial questions in lower levels of government in the way that the Amar-Caminker interpretation requires.  As if in direct reference to the <I>Crawford</I> decision--and even direct anticipation of Proposition 209--the <I>Seattle</I> Court in that footnote expressly <I>denied</I> that the &quot;horribles&quot; paraded by Justice Powell had any relevance to its decision-including Justice Powell's allegation that as a result of the <I>Seattle </I>decision a state might not be able to <I>set policy</I> in an area where a local governmental body arguably has done &quot;more&quot; than the Fourteenth Amendment requires.  But there is an additional reason as well: the view that the <I>Hunter </I>doctrine immunizes race-conscious measures taken by lower levels of government from policy prohibitions at higher levels of government leads to absurd results.</P>
<P>&#9;According to the Amar-Caminker interpretation of the <I>Hunter </I>doctrine, a state can create a right on the part of its citizens to be free of court-ordered mandatory racial busing, but is barred from creating a right on the part of its citizens to be free of such busing when it is ordered by a local school board.  This constitutional doctrine, besides being inconsistent with both the logic of the Court's analysis in <I>Crawford</I> and the explicit language of the Court's <I>Seattle </I>opinion, is absurd on its face.</P>
<P>If this view were correct, then the Fourteenth Amendment would grant greater political rights to minorities than it grants to whites.  Astonishingly, Amar and Caminker do not shrink from this conclusion:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>A state constitution may be amended so as to repeal or modify pre-existing constitutional provisions, even those that have been interpreted in a manner favoring a racial minority.  But a state constitution may not be amended in a direction that disadvantages the racial minority if the effect of such amendment would be to withdraw pre-existing <I>local or state legislative authority</I> [emphasis added] in a manner that is &quot;racial in character.&quot;  ...</P>
<P>We acknowledge that, so understood, the <I>Hunter</I> doctrine<I> </I>has<I> what some might perceive as a far-reaching consequence</I>.<SUP>25</SUP> With respect to a given issue that is &quot;racial in character,&quot; a state constitution may either remain neutral or prescribe norms favorable to racial minorities (which can later be repealed).  But a state constitution can <I>never </I>entrench a substantive norm with respect to an issue that is &quot;racial in character&quot; in a direction that disadvantages a racial minority.  For example, a constitution can mandate affirmative action, but it can never selectively prohibit it and thus foreclose the possibility of minority success in more accessible political arenas.<SUP>26</SUP></P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>What this means in plain terms is that at the constitutional level of government the people of a state can prohibit preferences for whites, but cannot prohibit preferences for minorities-or to put this another way, that a state can prohibit discrimination against minorities, but cannot prohibit discrimination against whites.  Whites, accordingly, in order to defend themselves against racial discrimination by governmental entities, must be prepared to combat affirmative action preferences now and forever (or at least until the Fourteenth Amendment is repealed) at each and every level of state and local government.  Whites cannot save themselves from this unpleasant task-which we know from experience will subject them to shrill cries of &quot;racism&quot;-by working to amend their state constitution.  Minorities, on the other hand, labor under no such restriction of their political rights.</P>
<P>The asserted constitutional doctrine has particularly absurd consequences at the federal level, which is arguably even more remote from local racial politics than a state constitution.  As Justice John Paul Stevens pointed out in his concurring opinion in <I>Johnson v. Santa Clara Transportation Agency</I> (1987), prior to 1978 the Court construed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as an absolute blanket prohibition against discrimination which neither required nor permitted discriminatory preferences for any group, minority or majority.<SUP>27</SUP>  No one in his or her right mind at the time could possibly have supposed that under this construction the U.S. Civil Rights Act violated the U.S. Constitution, or that a state constitutional provision which fully conformed with the U.S. Civil Rights Act as it was then interpreted was unconstitutional.  According to the Amar-Caminker interpretation of the <I>Hunter </I>doctrine, however, the Civil Rights Act in its original meaning and as it was interpreted by the Court prior to 1978 was arguably unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, and all state constitutional provisions at that time having the same effect were also unconstitutional.<SUP>28</P>
</SUP><P>&#9;Typically, legal opponents of Proposition 209 deny that they are committed to the view that minorities have a constitutional right to preferential treatment.  But the view that a state is permitted to prohibit racial discrimination against minorities but cannot prohibit racial preferences in their favor clearly entails preferential treatment for minorities <I>in some form or other</I>.  Under the Amar-Caminker interpretation of <I>Seattle </I>and <I>Crawford</I>, it turns out that this preferential treatment lies in the domain of political rights.</P>
<P>&#9;It is true that the <I>Hunter</I> Court said, &quot;The majority needs no protection against discrimination and if it did, a referendum might be bothersome but no more than that.&quot;<SUP>29</SUP>  But this cannot be read as an endorsement of a doctrine of special political rights for racial minorities.  In that passage, the Court was simply laying out the conditions under which an explicit alteration of the political decisionmaking process, like that of Akron City Charter  137, violates the Fourteenth Amendment; and it was making the common sense point that a measure of this sort cannot escape constitutional scrutiny simply on the grounds that it subjects &quot;Negroes and whites, Jews and Catholics...to the same requirements if there is housing discrimination against them which they wish to end.&quot;<SUP>30</SUP>  One certainly does not commit oneself to a constitutional doctrine of unequal political rights in favor of minorities simply by acknowledging that the relative numerical strength of various racial groups might be constitutionally relevant in scrutinizing explicit alterations in the political decisionmaking process on racial questions.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the foregoing passage from <I>Hunter </I>surely cannot be interpreted to mean that antidiscrimination laws are irrelevant to the majority.  The Fourteenth Amendment does not provide protection under the laws just for minorities: it provides <I>equal</I> protection under the laws for all citizens.  Similarly, the U.S. Civil Rights Act does not prohibit discrimination only against women and minorities: it prohibits discrimination against anyone on the basis of race or sex generally.</P>
<P>It is as preposterous to read a doctrine of unequal distribution of political rights into the Fourteenth Amendment as it is to read into it a doctrine of preferential treatment on the basis of race in any other respect.  Nor is there any reason to think that the present Court, which has taken an increasingly hostile view towards racial gerrymandering to promote equality of results in the political process for minorities, would find any merit in Amar and Caminker's constitutional analysis, according to which decisional law presently grants political rights to minorities under the Fourteenth Amendment that it does not grant to whites.<SUP>31</P>

</B></I><P>&#9;The Achilles heel of the <I>Seattle </I>line of attack against Proposition 209 is footnote 23 at 480 of the <I>Seattle </I>opinion, where the Court explicitly <I>denied</I> that the people of a state are &quot;forever barred from developing a different policy on mandatory busing where a school district previously has adopted one of its own&quot;; <I>denied</I> that its decision vests special rights in lower levels of government on racial questions; <I>denied </I>that a state is precluded from setting policy in an area where a local governmental body arguably has done &quot;more&quot; than the Fourteenth Amendment requires; etc.  Either this means what it says or it doesn't.  If it does mean what it says, then <I>Seattle</I> cannot provide a rationale for holding Proposition 209 unconstitutional-for Proposition 209 is a pure policy enactment, rather than an explicit alteration in the political decisionmaking structure.</P>
<P>Obviously, one cannot have a policy that precludes racial busing without <I>formulating</I> and <I>enacting</I> such a policy.  Merely repealing all existing ordinances and laws requiring or permitting mandatory racial busing is not a <I>policy</I>: it is an absence<I> </I>of a policy.  Consequently, in asserting that a state could have a policy that precluded mandatory racial busing, the <I>Seattle </I>Court was necessarily committed to the view that a state could do <I>more</I> than merely repeal existing mandatory busing policies.  And this means, in turn, that the <I>Seattle </I>Court was committed to the view that it would be constitutionally permissible for a state to have a policy which might read, for example, as follows: </P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The state shall not bus any student to a school other than the school that is nearest or the next nearest his or her place of residence in order to promote racial balance in the public schools, except in those certain instances where such busing is required by the federal constitution.  For the purposes of this section, &quot;state&quot; shall include, but not be limited to, the state, the State Department of Education, any local school board etc.</P></DIR>

<P>&#9;The attempt by Amar and Caminker to accommodate footnote 23 at 480 of the <I>Seattle</I> opinion doesn't even begin to adequately address the problem.  They conclude their paper with the following two sentences:  &quot;There are, of course, constitutional ways to disestablish affirmative action programs throughout California.  But under the present law of the land, the CCRI does not appear to be one of them.&quot;<SUP>32</SUP>  This is obviously inadequate to deal with the problem, for they fail to provide a single example of how a state could prohibit such measures without doing, in so many words, exactly what Proposition 209 does: i.e., <I>explicitly</I> prohibiting them.  In other words, unless they can spell out some other<I> </I>way in which a state can have a <I>policy</I> prohibiting race-conscious measures in its state constitution, one is compelled to read footnote 23 at 480 in the <I>Seattle </I>opinion as permitting policy enactments like Proposition 209.</P>
<P>Judge Thelton H. Henderson of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District in California has also failed to address this fundamental issue in his analysis of <I>Seattle</I>.  In his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order re the preliminary injunction against Proposition 209 he issued on December 23, 1996, he says:</P><DIR>

<P>Defendants submit that the <I>Seattle </I>and <I>Hunter </I>cases cannot be read to invalidate Proposition 209, because such a reading would necessarily lead to an absurd reordering of the relationship between states and subordinate local government units.  According to this argument, if the Court accepts plaintiffs' position, such a holding would, in effect, permit local governmental bodies to preempt state authority on any racial or gender issue, at least where the local entity has acted to confer a benefit on minorities or women.</P>
<P>In making this argument, defendants rely primarily on concerns expressed by Justice Powell in his dissenting opinion in <I>Seattle.</I> 458 U.S. at 494-95, 498, n. 14.  As the majority in that case pointed out, however, the difficult dilemma posed by Justice Powell was not presented by Initiative 350.  <I>Id.</I> At 480 n. 23.  Similarly, the dilemma posed by defendants does not follow from plaintiffs' equal protection claim in the instant case.  Nothing about plaintiffs' argument requires that the state of California be forever barred from addressing a race- or gender-conscious affirmative action program where a local authority has acted first.  The <I>Seattle-Hunter </I>doctrine merely regulates the <I>manner </I>of any state intervention, preventing the state from nonneutrally reordering the political process to burden the interests of minorities or women.  A state, for example, remains free to restructure the political process in a neutral manner, even where such a change indirectly burdens the political participation of women and minorities.  A state may also intercede where it can articulate a justification that survives equal protection scrutiny.  What a state may not do, according to the <I>Seattle-Hunter </I>doctrine, is single out an issue of special interest to minorities and women and require that such legislation run a unique political gauntlet.</P>
<P>Plaintiffs' argument does not require that, once supporters of race- and gender-conscious affirmative action have suceeded [sic] at the ballot box, their victory can never be undone.  Nothing in the Constitution requires that the political system guarantee victory to those who support affirmative action.  The body that enacts an affirmative action measure is free, of course, to repeal it. ... <I>See Crawford</I>, 458 U.S. at 539.  ....</P>
<P>Once those who support race- and gender-conscious affirmative action prevail at one level of government, however, the Equal Protection Clause will not tolerate an effort by the vanquished parties to alter the rules of the game-solely with respect to this single issue-so as to secure a reversal of fortunes.  Plaintiffs have borne their burden of showing that Proposition 209, by removing authority over race- and gender-conscious affirmative action to &quot;a new and remote&quot; level of government, has precisely such an effect.  Such a reordering of the political process is tantamount to vote dilution in the most literal sense: the relevant voting pool is effectively expanded until the prior victory is undone.  <I>Cf. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, </I>364 U.S. 339 (1960) (holding that a state may not impair the voting rights of minorities under the guise of reapportionment).  Where such a political restructuring is aimed at a subject of particular interest to minorities and women, it is particularly problematic, and the Equal Protection Clause demands that it be subjected to heightened judicial scrutiny.  &quot;A law declaring that in general it shall be more difficult for one group of citizens than for all others to seek aid from the government is itself a denial of equal protection in the most literal sense.&quot;  <I>Romer </I>v. <I>Evans</I>, 116 S. Ct. 1620, 1628 (1996).<SUP>33</SUP></P></DIR>

<P>Like the last two sentences of the Amar-Caminker paper, this passage fails to show how the view that Proposition 209 is unconstitutional under <I>Seattle </I>can be reconciled with the <I>Seattle </I>Court's statement that a state may have a <I>policy</I> that precludes race-conscious measures, even when a lower level of government has enacted such measures.  This point may become clearer by inspecting some of the specific assertions in this passage:</P>
<P> &#9;1.&#9;&quot;<I>As the majority in that case pointed out, however, the difficult dilemma posed by Justice Powell was not presented by Initiative 350</I>.&quot;  This response is inadequate because it fails to say <I>why</I> the difficult dilemma posed by Justice Powell was not presented by Initiative 350.  The obvious explanation is that Initiative 350 did not do so because it <I>did not embody a policy</I>.  If, on the other hand, Judge Henderson has a different understanding of why the <I>Seattle</I> Court held that the &quot;difficult dilemma posed by Justice Powell was not presented by Initiative 350,&quot; he is obligated to say what that interpretation is.  He clearly has not done so in this passage, and so far as the present author knows, he has not done so elsewhere.</P>
<P>2.&#9;&quot;<I>Nothing about plaintiffs' argument requires that the state of California be forever barred from addressing a race- or gender-conscious affirmative action program where a local authority has acted first</I>.&quot;   If the phrase &quot;addressing a race- or gender-conscious affirmative action program&quot; means &quot;having a <I>policy</I> prohibiting race- or gender-conscious affirmative action,&quot; the statement cited concedes the point at issue.  If, on the other hand, the phrase &quot;addressing a race- or gender-conscious affirmative action program&quot; means only that a state may <I>repeal</I> a race- or gender-conscious affirmative action program where a local authority has acted first, it is unacceptable as an interpretation of <I>Seattle </I>footnote 23 at 480, for a mere repeal is obviously different from a statewide policy that precludes race-conscious measures.</P>
<P>3.&#9;&quot;<I>Plaintiffs' argument does not require that, once supporters of race- and gender-conscious affirmative action have suceeded </I>[sic] <I>at the ballot box, their victory can never be undone.  ... The body that enacts an affirmative action measure is free, of course, to repeal it...&quot;</I> Again, this reply is inadequate because the <I>Seattle </I>Court's statement in footnote 23 at 480 cannot be interpreted as limited to mere repeals.   Furthermore, the statement that<I> &quot;The body that enacts an affirmative action measure</I> [emphasis added] is free, of course to repeal it...&quot; must be rejected because it appears to imply that an affirmative action measure can be repealed <I>only </I>by the body that enacted it.  This is plainly inconsistent with Judge Henderson's own statement that &quot;A state may also <I>intercede</I> [emphasis added] where it can articulate a justification that survives equal protection scrutiny,&quot; for intercession surely includes repeals.  It is also inconsistent with numerous passages in the <I>Hunter</I> trilogy of cases.<SUP>34</P>
</SUP><P>4.&#9;&quot;<I>Once those who support race- and gender-conscious affirmative action prevail at one level of government, however, the Equal Protection Clause will not tolerate an effort by the vanquished parties to alter the rules of the game-solely with respect to this single issue-so as to secure a reversal of fortunes.</I>&quot;  If this sentence means that any statement of <I>policy</I> by a higher level of government that precludes minorities from obtaining legislation that is in their &quot;interest&quot; at lower levels of government is an alteration of the &quot;rules of the game,&quot; then it is impossible to see how this statement can be reconciled with the view that a state <I>could </I>have a policy prohibiting racial preferences where another governmental body has acted first.  As was pointed out above, the proposition that the people of a state may adopt a race-neutral policy in their state constitution only on the condition that they also adopt a policy on each and every other conceivable question is totally impracticable.  Since this condition could never be met by any state constitution in the real world, imposing this condition would effectively preclude all race-neutral state constitutional provisions.</P>
<P><A NAME="henderson_gender">5.&#9;&quot;<I>Where such a political restructuring is aimed at a subject of particular interest to minorities </I>and women [emphasis added]<I>, it is particularly problematic, and the Equal Protection Clause demands that it be subjected to heightened judicial scrutiny</I>.&quot; </P>
<P>This statement, by including women in the analysis, betrays a total misunderstanding of the <I>Hunter </I>doctrine.  According to that doctrine, the majority is barred by the Fourteenth Amendment from using its numerical superiority to alter the political decisionmaking process in a way that specially burdens minorities on a racial issue.  The concern underlying the <I>Hunter </I>doctrine is to protect the interest of minorities in the political process, where they are at a disadvantage in obtaining legislation that is arguably in their interest precisely because they are a minority.<SUP>35</SUP>  It makes no sense to apply the same doctrine to women, because women comprise a political majority.</P>
<P>Judge Henderson's application of the &quot;heightened scrutiny&quot; for gender classifications to Proposition 209 also ignores the constitutionally relevant distinction between (1) a measure that uses an existing decisionmaking process to enact a policy on a racial question at a higher level of government, and (2) a measure that explicitly alters an existing decisionmaking process on a racial question. For example, Judge Henderson rejects the view that Proposition 209 serves the important state interest of ending discrimination on the basis of race and gender in the following terms:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>While undoubtedly important, however, this state interest is a non-sequitor [sic] with respect to Proposition 209.  The Court fails to see how this purported interest is related to, much less justifies, the nonneutral reordering of the political process that is at issue in this case.  As <I>Seattle</I> and <I>Hunter </I>make clear, it is <I>not </I>[emphasis in original] Proposition 209's prohibition on affirmative action that raises equal protection concerns; rather, it is the reordering of the political process that triggers exacting judicial scrutiny.  Defendants have not identified any feature of the prior political process that was discriminatory, and thus their invocation of a state interest in eliminating discrimination cannot justify the nonneutral reordering of that process.<SUP>36</SUP></P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;This passage asserts that the <I>purpose</I> of Proposition 209 is to reorder the political process to make it more difficult for women to obtain legislation that Judge Henderson deems to be in their interest.   But this is mistaken.  Unlike Initiative 350 and Akron City Charter  137, Proposition 209 does not explicitly alter the political decisionmaking process at all.  Unlike Initiative 350 and Akron City Charter  137, it <I>does</I> establish a policy, i.e., one of prohibiting discrimination and preferences on the basis, <I>inter alia</I>, of sex.</P>
<P>Judge Henderson acknowledges in the foregoing passage that prohibiting racial and gender discrimination constitutes an important state interest, but he regards that as irrelevant to Proposition 209, since that interest fails to justify what he regards as the &quot;nonneutral reordering of the political process that is at issue in this case.&quot;  But of course that state interest isn't irrelevant to Proposition 209, because the only way that the <I>State of California</I> can have a policy of prohibiting discrimination and preferences on the basis of sex is for the State of California <I>itself</I> to enact a measure prohibiting such discrimination and preferences.  This is precisely what the people of the State of California did on November 5, 1996 when they adopted Proposition 209 as Article I, Section 31 of the state constitution.</P>
<P>&#9;Like Amar and Caminker, Judge Henderson wants to have it both ways.  On the one hand, he would like to accommodate the plain meaning of footnote 23 at 480 of the <I>Seattle </I>opinion, according to which a state may have <I>policies</I> that prohibit race-conscious measures that are not required by the federal constitution, even when they preempt race-conscious measures taken by lower levels of government that the Court might deem to be in their interest.  On the other hand, he wants to hold that, according to the <I>Seattle </I>precedent, a state cannot have such policies.  This is incoherent because it is logically inconsistent.  By arguing that Proposition 209's prohibition of <I>gender</I> discrimination and preferences is likely unconstitutional under the <I>Hunter</I> doctrine, Judge Henderson has only compounded the confusion, for the <I>Hunter </I>doctrine cannot sensibly be applied to women voters, because women comprise a political majority of both the electorate <A NAME="henderson_gender_end">and of actual voters.</A><SUP>37</P>
</SUP><P></A></P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">CONCLUSION</P>
</B><P>&#9;According to the <I>Seattle </I>Court, a state may adopt a policy that precludes race-conscious measures that arguably benefit racial minorities, even though that policy preempts race-conscious legislation at lower levels of government.  What it may not do is explicitly alter the decisionmaking structure on a specifically racial question in a way that makes it more difficult for racial minorities to obtain legislation that the Court might deem to be in their interest.  Since Proposition 209 is a pure policy enactment, and does not explicitly alter the political decisionmaking process on a racial question, it does not offend the <I>Hunter </I>doctrine.</P>
<P>&#9;It would have been astonishing if the <I>Seattle </I>Court had come to any other conclusion.  To reach the conclusion that the federal constitution prohibits such policies and civil rights measures, the <I>Seattle </I>Court would have had to stretch the expression &quot;explicit alteration of a political decisionmaking structure&quot; to the point where it loses any clear, recognizable meaning.  Secondly, it would have had to commit itself to the preposterous constitutional doctrine (which Amar and Caminker actually find meritorious) that a state can have a per se rule prohibiting discrimination against minorities, but cannot have a per se rule prohibiting discrimination against whites.  Minorities, accordingly, would have political rights under the Fourteenth Amendment that the majority does not have.</P>
<P>&#9;Amar and Caminker assure us that even under their interpretation of <I>Seattle </I>there are &quot;constitutional ways to disestablish affirmative action programs throughout California.&quot;<SUP>38</SUP>  But they do not say what these methods are.  Their statement cannot merely mean that each and every program of racial preferences can be repealed, one by one, by the governmental entity that enacted it, for the majority might have to wait forever for that to happen, and even if it did, the end result would fall short of a statewide policy <I>prohibiting</I> racial preferences.  The problem, of course, is that the statement of the <I>Seattle </I>Court in footnote 23 at 480 can sensibly be read only as acknowledging that statewide policy measures preempting race-conscious measures taken by lower levels of government are not per se unconstitutional, and that reading totally undermines the Amar-Caminker interpretation of the <I>Hunter </I>doctrine.</P>
<P>Unless the legal opponents of Proposition 209 can find another, plausible<I> </I>way of interpreting this plain, straightforward statement, <I>Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1</I> cannot be regarded as a court precedent that stands in the way of a judicial determination that Proposition 209 is constitutional, and legal opponents of the measure will have to look elsewhere for a pretext for striking it down. </P>

<P><SUP>1</SUP>Like the Amar-Caminker paper, this one focuses on the issue of race.

<SUP><P>6</SUP> The provision read: &quot;It is the paramount duty of the state to make ample provision for the education of all children residing in its borders without distinction or preference on account of race, color, caste, or sex.&quot;  Justice Powell noted in his dissent that the Supreme Court of the State of Washington had not interpreted this provision to prohibit race-conscious school assignments in the absence of a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  But surely, Powell pointed out, one would suppose that the state court <I>could</I> have rendered such a decision without violating the federal constitution.</P>
<SUP><P>7</SUP> Citing  <I>Bakke</I>, 438 U.S. 265.  Cf. the following passage from the dissent by Brennan et al. in <I>Bakke</I>: &quot;It may be that the Harvard plan is more acceptable to the public than is the Davis 'quota.'  If it is, any State, including California, is free to adopt it in preference to a less acceptable alternative, just as it is generally free, as far as the Constitution is concerned, to abjure granting any racial preferences in its admissions program.&quot;  438 U.S. 379 (<I>Bakke</I>).</P>

<SUP><P>9</SUP>  This is a full citation of the footnote.  Ellipses indicate merely the omission of internal references.</P>
<SUP><P>10</SUP> Cf. &quot;We are unimpressed with any of Akron's justifications for its discrimination.  Characterizing it simply as a public decision to move slowly in the delicate area of race relations emphasizes the impact and burden of  137, but does not justify it.&quot;  393 U.S. 392 (<I>Hunter</I>).</P>
<SUP><P>11</SUP> In <I>Reitman</I>, the Court held that while it would permissible for the people of a state to repeal all existing fair housing laws, the people of a state could not amend their constitution to establish a right to discriminate on the basis of race in private real estate transactions.  There is no constitutionally relevant point in common between the measure held unconstitutional in <I>Reitman</I> and Proposition 209, which contains a stronger prohibition against racial discrimination and preferences than anything that is presently found in either the federal constitution or the constitution of the State of California.  The ban against racial discrimination in Proposition 209 is a per se rule.  Existing state and federal bans against racial discrimination fall short of this.  Consequently, it cannot be argued that in going beyond a &quot;mere repeal&quot; of laws and measures permitting racial preferences, Proposition 209 runs afoul of the Court's ruling in <I>Reitman</I>.  For 209 to run afoul of that ruling, it would have to be shown that Proposition 209's per se ban against racial discrimination implicates the state in racial discrimination.  Such a claim would be absurd.</P>
<SUP><P>12</SUP> Cf. the following passages from <I>Seattle </I>which cite the <I>Hunter</I> precedent:  &quot;In the end, appellants are reduced to suggesting that <I>Hunter</I> has been effectively overruled by more recent decisions of this Court.&quot;  458 U.S. 484.  &quot;For present purposes, it is enough that minorities may consider busing for integration to be 'legislation that is in their interest'.... Given the racial focus of Initiative 350, this suffices to trigger application of the <I>Hunter</I> doctrine.&quot;  454 U.S. 474.  &quot;We are also satisfied that the practical effect of Initiative 350 is to work a reallocation of power of the kind condemned in <I>Hunter.</I>  ...  As in <I>Hunter</I>, then, the community's political mechanisms are modified to place effective decisionmaking authority over a racial issue at a different level of government.&quot;  458 U.S. 474.  &quot;Appellants' suggestion that this analysis somehow conflicts with <I>Hunter</I>, however, misapprehends the basis of the <I>Hunter</I> doctrine.&quot;  458 U.S. 485.</P>
<P>Cf. also 458 U.S. 470, which refers to both <I>Hunter</I> and <I>Lee</I> <I>v</I>. <I>Nyquist</I> (318 F. Supp. 710 (WDNY 1979)):  &quot;We believe that the Court of Appeals properly focused on <I>Hunter</I> and <I>Lee</I>, for we find the principle of those cases dispositive of the issue here.  In our view, Initiative 350 must fall because it does 'not attemp[t] to allocate governmental power on the basis of any general principle.' ... Instead, it uses the racial nature of an issue to define the governmental decisionmaking structure, and thus imposes substantial and unique burdens on racial minorities.&quot;</P>
<SUP><P>13</SUP> Cf. &quot;Certainly, a state requirement that 'desegregation or antidiscrimination laws,' ... and only such laws, be passed by unanimous vote of the legislature would be constitutionally suspect.  It would be equally questionable for a community to require that laws or ordinances 'designed to ameliorate race relations or to protect racial minorities' ... be confirmed by popular vote of the electorate as a whole, while comparable legislation is exempted from a similar procedure.&quot;  458 U.S. 486-487 (<I>Seattle</I>).</P>
<SUP><P>14</SUP> Cf. &quot;The CCRI singles out race and treats it differently from any other criterion for public employment, education, and contracting decisions. In doing so, the CCRI isolates an issue of special interest to minorities-affirmative action programs ... --and relegates this issue to the highest and most entrenched level of governmental decisionmaking.  This would seem to violate the Equal Protection Clause as interpreted by the Court in the <I>Hunter</I> trilogy [<I>Hunter v. Erickson; Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1</I>; and <I>Crawford v. Board of Education</I>].&quot;  Ibid., p. 3.</P>
<SUP><P>15</SUP> Ibid., p. 27, fn. 85.</P>
<SUP><P>16</SUP> The footnote is cited in full at p. <A HREF="#footnote_23_at_480">*</A>, <I>supra</I>.</P>
<SUP><P>17</SUP>Although it is an obvious logical point, it might be worth noting here that within any given domain the category &quot;racial or non-racial&quot; covers <I>everything</I>.</P>
<SUP><P>18</SUP> In fact, the Amar-Caminker interpretation of <I>Seattle</I> is not even plausible when it is applied to the state legislature and to state officials, for the idea that the people of California could designate the state legislature to be the sole policy-making body in the state is also absurd.  An arrangement of this sort would entail a degree of bureaucratic centralism in the governance of the state that was not even approached in the Soviet Union by the Politburo during the era of Josef Stalin.  A monolithic decisionmaking of the required sort would in all likelihood not be feasible, and in any case would certainly be undesirable, in a state the size of California.  But this suggestion is arguably slightly less absurd than the suggestion that the people could write all policies, for all levels of government in the state, into the state constitution through the initiative process.  That suggestion is <I>totally</I> absurd.</P>
<P>The difference between the interpretation of footnote 23 that is advocated in this paper and the one provided (elliptically and implicitly) by Amar and Caminker, can be summarized as follows.  On the interpretation that is advocated here, the assertion in footnote 23 that a state is permitted to adopt a policy prohibiting race-conscious action even when a local school board has acted first means exactly what it says.  According to Amar and Caminker, however, it means that the state government may do so, but only if it also accepts responsibility for setting policy on every <I>other </I>conceivable matter.  But their assertion that the people of a state may establish a race-neutral policy even when a subordinate jurisdiction has enacted a race-<I>conscious</I> policy first is at war with the claim that the people of a state may do so only if they reserve <I>all</I> policy-making responsibilities to themselves, for this condition could never be met in the real world.  There is therefore a contradiction.  Hence the Amar-Caminker interpretation of footnote 23-which is totally unnatural and implausible on its face anyway-is untenable.</P>
<P>Finally, let it be noted that the problem is not with the rule laid down in <I>Seattle</I> that an <I>explicit</I> alteration of the political decisionmaking structure on a specifically racial question that disadvantages racial minorities is unconstitutional.  According to that principle, any <I>explicit</I> change in the decisionmaking structure cannot be specifically directed to a racial question, but must apply generally.  That constitutional principle is workable, and does not lead to the  result that race-conscious measures by subordinate entities preempt race-neutral policies by higher governmental entities unless higher governmental entities are <I>also </I>prohibited from adopting race-neutral policies directly, quite independently of that constitutional principle.  It is the combination of <I>Seattle's </I>constitutional doctrine with the Amar-Caminker assertion that a pure policy enactment like Proposition 209 is <I>also </I>unconstitutional that leads inexorably to the conclusion that race-neutral policies by higher levels of government are preempted whenever race-conscious policies benefiting racial minorities have been adopted by subordinate levels of government.  This result is plainly irreconcilable with the <I>Seattle </I>Court's assertion in footnote 23 that a higher governmental entity is not forever barred from having such a policy when a subordinate entity has acted first.</P>
<SUP><P>19</SUP> Cf. &quot;Some might try to invoke a procedure-substance distinction in an effort to separate the CCRI from the initiatives found wanting in <I>Hunter</I> and <I>Seattle</I>.  In both of these cases, the Court's language repeatedly characterized the initiatives at issue as having 'restructured' the pre-existing political process to impose burdens that are 'racial in character.' ... This repeated emphasis at least raises the possibility that such <I>explicit </I>restructuring is conceived by the Court to be an integral part of the unconstitutional burden driving the <I>Hunter</I> doctrine.  In other words, one might argue, the <I>Hunter </I>doctrine prohibits states from enacting initiatives that <I>on their face</I> directly restructure the pre-existing political process in a manner that is 'racial in character,' but does not similarly prohibit states from enacting initiatives that on their face merely 'work a simple change in policy,' even if they <I>incidentally </I>entrench the new policy.</P>
<P>&quot;We acknowledge that such a purported procedure-substance distinction might at first blush provide a plausible defense of the CCRI.  After all, on its face the CCRI looks more like a mere change of policy rather than a direct attempt to reallocate political power within the state.  Unlike the Akron charter amendment and Initiative 350, the CCRI does not directly declare that it is withdrawing political authority from one government level and vesting it solely in a higher one (i.e., the constitutional amendment process).&quot;  Amar and Caminker, p. 28.</P>

Cited in part by Amar and Caminker, ibid., p. 30, where the passage is adduced as evidence that the <I>Seattle </I>Court explicitly rejected a &quot;bright-line distinction between procedural and substantive changes&quot; (p. 29).  Although the authors opine that this rejection is &quot;consistent with the Court's general concern for real-world effects and its rejection of formalism,&quot; they fail to mention footnote 23 at 480 of the <I>Seattle </I>opinion in this connection.  As argued above (pp. <A HREF="#amarcaminker_start">*</A>-<A HREF="#amarcaminker_end">*</A>), there is no plausible way of interpreting that footnote except as an acknowledgment by the Court that this distinction <I>is</I> a constitutionally important one.</P>
<SUP><P>21</SUP><FONT FACE="Roman"> 458 U.S. 497; 458 U.S. 497-498; 458 U.S. 498 (<I>Seattle</I>).</P>
</FONT><SUP><P>22</SUP> In citing this section of the California state constitution, the square brackets &quot;[1]&quot;, &quot;[2]&quot;, &quot;[3]&quot;, and &quot;[4]&quot; have been inserted to facilitate references to particular phrases in the following exposition.  Before the adoption of Proposition I, Article I, Section 7(a) included only (a)[1]; (a)[2]-(a)[4] were added to it by Proposition I.  The latter portions have been italicized in the citation.</P>
<SUP><P>23</SUP> 458 U.S. 546 (<I>Crawford</I>).  The opinion was written by Justice Blackmun.</P>
<SUP><P>24</SUP> Amar and Caminker, pp. 31-32.</P>
<SUP><P>25 </SUP>Emphasis added.  This is an understatement: the consequence is not just far-reaching, it is preposterous.</P>
<SUP><P>26</SUP> Ibid., pp. 34-35.</P>
<SUP><P>27</SUP> <I>Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, California, </I>et al., 480 U.S. 642-643 (1987) (concurring opinion, Justice Stevens).</P>
<SUP><P>28</SUP> Cf. &quot;Indeed, under the Court's theory one must wonder whether-under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment-even the Federal Government could assert its superior authority to regulate in these areas.&quot;  458 U.S. 498, fn. 14 (from Justice Powell's dissent).  Like all the other &quot;horribles&quot; paraded by Justice Powell in his dissent, this allegation was denied by the Court in footnote 23 at 480 of the <I>Seattle </I>opinion.  It is significant, in fact, that the Court majority did not credit <I>any</I> of Powell's allegations.  All were simply denied, outright.</P>
<SUP><P>29 </SUP>393 U.S. 391 (<I>Hunter</I>).</P>
<SUP><P>30</SUP> 393 U.S. 390 (<I>Hunter</I>).</P>
<SUP><P>31</SUP> See <I>Shaw v. Reno</I> (1993) 125 L Ed 2d 511, where the Court held that a particularly egregious instance of racial gerrymandering constituted a racial classification, and was therefore unconstitutional unless it could be justified as furthering a compelling state interest.</P>
<SUP><P>32</SUP> Ibid., p. 39.</P>
<SUP><P>33</SUP> Judge Thelton H. Henderson, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND ORDER RE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, <I>Coalition for Economic Equity</I>, et al., v. <I>Pete Wilson</I>, et al., No. C 96-4024 THE, December 23, 1996, pp. 44-46.</P>
<SUP><P>34</SUP> Cf. the <I>Seattle </I>Court's explicit denial of Justice Powell's claim that under the Court's ruling no higher authority could &quot;intervene&quot; in a state law school's affirmative action policies unless that authority &quot;traditionally dictated admissions policies.&quot;  458 U.S. 480, fn. 23.  Also: &quot;Had Akron's fair housing ordinance been defeated at a referendum, for example, 'Negroes would undoubtedly [have lost] an important political battle, but they would not thereby [have been] denied equal protection.&quot; 458 U.S. 483 (<I>Seattle</I>).  Many other counterexamples could be cited to the view that race-conscious measures can be repealed only by the governmental body that enacts it. </P>
<SUP><P>35</SUP> Cf. &quot;...when the State's allocation of power places unusual burdens on the ability of racial groups to enact legislation specifically designed to overcome the 'special condition' of prejudice, the governmental action seriously 'curtail[s] the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities.'  <I>United States v. Carolene Products Co</I>., 304 U.S. 144, 153, n. 4, 58 S.Ct. 778, 783-784, n. 4, 82 L.Ed. 1234 (1938).  In a most direct sense, this implicates the judiciary's special role in safeguarding the interests of those groups that are 'relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.'  <I>San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriquez</I>, 411 U.S. 1, 28, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 1296, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973).&quot;  458 U.S. 486 (<I>Seattle</I>).</P>
<SUP><P>36</SUP> Ibid., p. 43.</P>
<SUP><P>37</SUP> As it turns out, the women voters of the state do not even agree with Judge Henderson that preferences on the basis of sex are in their interest-or, if they do believe that they are in their &quot;interest&quot; in some sense, they voted to abolish them anyway.  According to the Voter News Service's exit polling on November 5, 52 percent of those who voted on Proposition 209 were women.  Of these, 52 percent voted for the measure; 48 percent voted against it.  Of white women who voted on the measure, 59 percent voted for it; 41 percent voted against it.</P>

</center>

<hr size=4 noshade>

<P>

<body>THE CLAREMONT INSTITUTE finds the answers to America's problems in the principles on which our nation was founded. These principles are expressed most eloquently in the Declaration of Independence, which proclaims that "all men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. . . ." 

<p>

To recover the Founding principles in our political life means  recovering a limited and accountable government that respects private property, promotes stable family life and maintains a strong defense.

<p>

The Institute's work is only beginning. Today, our state and federal governments spend vast and increasing sums of public money for less and less good. The public sector continues to grow at the expense of the private. Regulations intrude into every corner of our lives. Schools no longer perform. Police and courts no longer protect. Good businesses are being driven to extinction by excessive and discriminatory controls, and as a result good jobs continue to disappear. Dependence grows and opportunity wanes with each passing year.

<p>

The Claremont Institute believes that informed citizens can and will make the right choices for America's future.  Through its books, policy briefings, conferences and seminars, and now through the new electronic media of the World Wide Web, the Institute engages Americans in an informed discussion of the principles and policies necessary to rebuild our civic institutions. 

<P>

Founded in 1979, the Claremont Institute's work is national in scope but gives special emphasis to the problems of our country's largest state, where the Institute is based.  Institute studies like the pioneering 1988 book <I>The Imperial Congress</I> (co-published with The Heritage Foundation), innovative policy proposals such as our 1995 <I>Contract With California</I>, our ongoing work on the cultural attacks on the American family, and our decade-long involvement in the critical debates over environmental regulations and property rights law--all have earned the Institute a reputation for sound scholarship and diligence in the service of constitutional government.

<p>

America's Founders endowed our Republic with sound principles and a framework for governing that is unmatched in the history of mankind.  The prosperity and freedom of America can only be made secure if they are guided by a return to these basic principles as our country enters the 21st Century.</body>

   <h1>Our Programs</h1>

</center>

<hr size=4 noshade>

<P>

<h4>The Center for the Study of Natural Law</h4>

<body>The Center for the Study of Natural Law publishes books and reports on the state of family life and the moral precepts underpinning our political institutions. Its aim is to enhance public understanding of the disastrous decline in morality that follows from failed social policies. In addition to books and studies, the Center conducts Pastors Forums and other meetings to strengthen the understanding of our constitutional heritage and encourage active participation in our nation's civic life.  The Center's newest educational program is a venture into the new technology of learning, a CD-ROM: <I>We Hold These Truths: The Argument and the Action of the American Founding</I>.  Available in early 1997, it will be accessible to millions of students and teachers through the Institute's Internet home page on the World Wide Web.</body>

<p>

<h4>The Golden State Center for Policy Studies</h4>
<body>Through the Golden State Center in Sacramento, 
Claremont Institute scholars produce policy papers and reports that educate policy makers, the media, and interested citizens on issues such as the budget, group preferences and quotas, education reform, environmental regulation, 
taxation, health care, and welfare reform. Golden State Center policy briefings have become an important resource for reform-minded state legislators.</body>
<p>

<h4>The Salvatori Center for the American Constitution</h4>

<body>The Salvatori Center conducts academic programs that educate school teachers, public officials, writers, editors and journalists in the principles and practices of American constitutionalism.  The Salvatori Center's programs include curriculum materials for schools, educational seminars for legislators, scholarly panels at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, the Publius Fellowships for young scholars, and the newly established Abraham Lincoln Fellowships in Constitutional Government for congressional staff and policy analysts at the federal level.</body>

<h4>The Center for Environmental Education Research<h4>

<body>The CEER publishes reports and curriculum materials to provide America's parents and classroom teachers balanced and objective information to help students understand the complexity environmental issues. It also advises state education policymakers in the design of sound curriculum standards and guidelines. A Scientific Advisory Council of eminent scholars and scientists assists the Center with its work.</body>

   "Where do we look for innovative, free market solutions to the problems 
   that confront California and our nation?  We turn to organizations like 
   the Claremont Institute, where some of America's top conservative 
   thinkers do their work."

   "Right now there are very few groups that are effective against the liberal 
   policies and special interests that are corrupting our system.  Fortunately, 
   the Claremont Institute is an exception.  That's why I have chosen to become 
   a part of their efforts."

<H3>A MESSAGE TO HOLLYWOOD: <i>Sleaze Doesnt Sell</i></H3></center>
<p>
<ul>
<li>In the absence of strong families, good schools and faithful churches and 
by the power of their own appeal, movies have become an increasingly 
dominant force on our social landscape.
<li>The real and most important power of film is its capacity to alter moral 
sensibilities, and to mold dispositions, outlooks, and habits of the mind 
and heart. The consistent bombardment of gratuitous violence, sexual 
innuendo, profanity, and degradation from popular movies eventually 
shapes, alters, and colors our sensibility.
<li>Despite the significant number of films in the category of <i>Showgirls, 
Striptease, Pulp Fiction</i>, and <i>Natural Born Killers</i> we have seen a 
resurgence in movies that promote traditional moral values such as: <br>
<center>Honor -- <i>Braveheart</i><br>
Courage -- <i>Apollo 13</i><br>
Patriotism -- <i>Independence Day</i><br>
Faithfulness -- <i>Forest Gump</i><br>
Perseverance -- <i>Babe</i><p></center>

<li>In fact, seven of the ten top-grossing movies of 1995 had ratings of G, 
PG, or PG-13 and all of the ten top-grossing movies of all-time had 
ratings of G, PG or PG-13 and are considered family oriented.

<li>These numbers indicate progress can and has been made through moral 
suasion and market forces, not government intervention. Empower 
America intends to keep making the case that civilization needs cultural 
guardrails and certain reliable standards of right and wrong that may not 
be enforceable in law but must be enforceable through conscience and 
consensus.

<h2><center>
Final Floor Address<br>
U.S. Senator Malcolm Wallop<br> 
(Senate - December 01, 1994)</center></h2>
<right> 
</right>
<P>
<b>U.S. Senator Mr. WALLOP</b>. Mr. President, 18 years ago, and again 12, and again 6 years ago, the people of
Wyoming sent me to Washington to reaffirm their vision of America--to protect the America they
know and love against all enemies foreign and domestic. In each of my campaigns, I made no bones
about who those enemies were, and what we should do about them. Today, as I choose to end my
years in the Senate, I am delighted that our main foreign enemies have collapsed, happy to have
been among the staunchest opponents of communism and the Soviet Union, and thrilled to have
played a major part in leaving our country a splendid new weapon against new enemies who might
arise. But I regret that the domestic enemies against whom I campaigned--big government and the
culture of statism--are a greater threat than ever to the American way of life. The only encouraging
sign on this front is that illusions about the benevolence of government have well-nigh vanished
among ordinary Americans. Perhaps politicians will get the message.
<P>
Far be it from me to claim credit on behalf of conservatives for the fall of communism. I thank God
alone for the fact that the bloody hammer and sickle was hauled down the Kremlin's flagpole on
Christmas Day 1991. And I recognize that the Communist system, corrupt in every way, would still
be aiming missiles at us except for the total, comical incompetence of Mikhail Gorbachev. It is both
presumptuous and futile to speculate what effect, if any, foreigners had on the minds of the Soviet
officials who made decisions that inadvertently destroyed the Soviet Union. Their intramural
discussions at the time contained nothing either about the hardness or the softness of American
policy. Nor for that matter are they about economics. The evidence points to Gorbachev, his friends,
and his antagonists being motivated by the pettiest politics. Moreover, living in the house that Stalin
built, they had lost the will to rule by mass murder, as Stalin had.
But we can be precisely certain of what Americans were trying to do with regard to the Soviet
Union. There can be no doubt about some of us. I told anyone who would listen, every chance I got,
that the Soviet Union and its empire were our mortal enemy, that we ought to do everything in our
power to throw it on the scrap heap of history, and that we ought to prepare to fight, survive, and
win a war against it. President Reagan felt this passion but there is little doubt how ridiculed this point
of view was in high places. Just look up the countless declarations of the Secretaries of State about
how brilliant Gorbachev was, and how dedicated we should be to a United States-Soviet
partnership. Or look up theirs and the prestige press' disdain for the view that communism was
something to be destroyed, not compromised with. These same sophisticates opposed providing the
key weapons to the Afghans who defeated the Soviet invasion of their country. As chairman of the
Budget Subcommittee of the Intelligence Committee, I doubled the budget for our Afghan
operations every time it came before me, and put in provisions for Stinger missiles. I also fought
these same officials to put weapons into the hands of the Nicaraguan Contras who defeated a
Soviet-Cuban takeover of their country that could have put Mexico onto a path far worse than the
excellent one that it is now treading. When these officials, never mind liberal Senators, put their faith
in arms control and in the Soviet Union's observance of treaties, I preferred to trust in American
defensive weapons. The Soviet Foreign Minister acknowledged that the American officials and
Senators felt no inclination to apologize to those whom they had maligned for being right. But that
was not surprising. A press that had joined them in maligning us was not about to insist upon
contrition.
<P>
Most of all I am proud of the role I played between 1978 and 1983 in starting many of the Defense
Department programs that would later be labeled SDI.
<P>
Let me emphasize the difference: The programs I helped to start did not aim at research. Nor did
they aim at abstract, grand schemes: They aimed to produce actual, individual weapons and sensors
to kill missiles that could kill Americans. Then President Reagan put the SDI Program into the hands
of people who, sad to say, wanted to use it for every imaginable purpose--except to build real
weapons. And so, in the name of SDI, hucksters spent billions of dollars for never-never projects,
while arms controllers handicapped real weapons programs diluting, delaying, and usually dooming
them.
<P>
But, I am happy to say, one anti-missile program managed to survive SDI better than might have
been expected. This is the chemical-power space based laser, the very weapon that first raised
interest in serious missile defense 15 years ago. No program was so maligned as this. Everybody
from Edward Teller to Sidney Drell said this laser weapon couldn't be built,
and--paradoxically--said it would be dangerous to try to build it. None was so politically incorrect.
But in a nutshell, by adhering to the guidelines I laid out for it 15 years ago, this program has
produced all the pieces of a weapon that could destroy any missile ever built or designed within 2
seconds, at distances greater than 3,000 miles. If
this country and this Congress want protection against the missiles that Saddam Husseim, Kim
Jong-Il, or anybody else might send against us or our allies, they have only to say so, and this
defensive weapon can be put together. It is there. Now.
<P>
Sure, the arms controllers in the U.S. Government made certain that no program would produce any
component of a weapon. But the good guys can play with definitions as well as the bad guys--and
sometimes the good guys win. The Space-Based Laser Program was broken up into any number of
pieces. But the people running the pieces remembered: Don't build laboratory devices. Build only
things that can be mass-produced. If you must scale down a piece of equipment, do it by using a
fraction of other parts you would use in the real McCoy. Thus the laser you can see at the TRW
facility at San Juan Capistrano, CA develops about 2 megawatts of power. But it has only one-third
of the pieces that an 8-megawatt missile killing device would have. And what is there is laid out in a
frame designed from the outset to accept the remainder of other pieces. So it is with the rest of the
weapon.
<P>
The credit goes to the marvelous American engineers who did it. I hope that the incoming Congress
takes the opportunity to spend some of the money that the American people mistakenly believe is
spent on our mutual protection to buy this device, which could save millions of American lives. If this
happens, I will be glad I had something to do with making it possible.
<P>
But why continue to worry about foreign enemies now that communism is gone? In short, because as
Charles de Gaulle used to say, `The future lasts a long time.' During the past half century we have
been involved in only two major wars, and the parts of the world that are most important to us have
been relatively peaceful because the United States of America has been militarily strong. But in
recent years, under Presidents of both parties, we have been living under the assumption that history
has ended. Nothing could be further from the truth. No assumption could be more dangerous.
American military power--and nothing but American military power--has kept a Pax Americana
over Europe and the Northern Pacific Rim. Now that American power is withdrawing, we see
NATO humiliated on its doorstep, and Japan and South Korea cowering before North Korea's
budding nuclear arsenal. We risk losing the world that our grandfathers won for us in World War II,
and we risk the birth of a world disorder that may require a lot more from our children than the
post-war world has required of us.
<P>
Our country needs better defense policy. Reversing the shrinkage and de-nuclearization of our
Armed Forces, as well as providing a serious anti-missile defense, would be good places to begin.
More important, we need a more serious national discussion of foreign and defense policy. I am
leaving the Senate, but will take part in that discussion.
<P>
The people of Wyoming first sent me to Washington in 1976 in part because I articulated their
frustration with Federal occupational safety and health regulations. Who could be against health and
safety on the job? Who could be against clean air and water? Certainly not the good people of
Wyoming. Certainly not me. Our beef--if you will pardon the expression--is with a government that
uses these and other lofty purposes as a means of exercising arbitrary bureaucratic power.
Government at all levels taxes, spends, and regulates roughly twice as much as when I grew up. It
touches every aspect of our lives, and harms just about everything it touches. It will fine you for not
wearing a seatbelt, but will not protect your life from criminals. It will deliver contraceptives to your
children, but cannot deliver the mail. It prohibits a Jewish community in New York from having a
school district--who knows what politically incorrect things their kids might learn from reading the
bible--and it forces the culture of abortion on the whole country. In the name of racial equality, the
Government forces us to discriminate on the basis of race. Once upon a time, our Government was
a bulwark against domestic enemies. Now big Government has become our chief domestic enemy.
<P>
In 1980 the American people voted for the Republic Party, hoping that the Republicans would
shrink the Government and make it switch sides in the great cultural conflict that is raging among us.
But the Republicans put on their tuxes and spent their time trying to make the system work. And so
taxes rose, regulations multiplied, officials became more arrogant, courts took over more of other
people's powers, and society continued to become less recognizably American. In 1992 the
American people threw out a Republican President who, obviously was on the side of the
Government rather than of the people. Now the electorate has put its hopes in a Republican
Congress, but the American people have made clear that they do not trust Republicans very far.
Almost three out of five Americans say they would like to see a new political party--and most of
those who say so usually vote Republican. To me, this means that the Republican Party has one
more chance to be on the side of the America's people and against their Government. If it muffs this
chance, it will be abandoned--deservedly so. The electorate asked republican politicians to do
something very unnatural to any politician--yield back power. Restore the people's dominion over
turf you have now occupied from democratic plantation managers.
<P>
What should the Republican Party do? Nothing less than to pursue a vision of America radically
opposed to that of contemporary sophisticates--the America our Founding Fathers established, our
fathers fought for, and the America we grew up in. Our Founders--Washington, Jefferson,
Lincoln--set this country on the path to greatness by making sure that our Government would be
small and frugal, that it would be on the side of the virtues necessary to preserve the system. Lincoln,
for example, argued that accepting slavery as an alternative source of labor would undermine respect
for all labor, and that it would foster the habit of living off one another. Lincoln taught that fear of
God, respect for human life, freedom and property, would allow generations of Americans who had
no blood ties to the Founders to become `flesh of the flesh and blood of the blood' with them. The
Government established by the Founders did not make us moral. But it took pains to be on the right
side of the great moral questions.
<P>
This country was peaceful and secure not because the streets were patrolled by Government agents,
but because citizens enforced high standards of civil behavior, because citizens were armed and
protected their own property, and because local police were highly responsive to the demands of
local citizens. The police knew the difference between the decent citizens whom they served, and the
deviants against whom they worked.
<P>
This country was wealthy not because of its natural resources--the Indians had lived in violent
semi-starvation--or because Government gave us this or that, nor because Government forced
wages up nor because it granted privileges to favorite companies. Americans created more wealth
than the world had ever known because Government in America taxed less, regulated less, and gave
fewer privileges than any other government in history.
<P>
This country became a world power not because there are so many of us--the Chinese are six times
as numerous--or because we are so rich--the European Union has a bigger economy--or because
we have so many weapons--Russia has more. Our numbers, our wealth, and our weapons became
military power because the American people are more patriotic, and more apt to think that we have
a duty to do what is right and reasonable than any other people in the world. And we became
powerful because until recently our leaders honored the American people's religion and manliness,
and because they themselves served in the Armed Forces.
<P>
With each passing year, however, our America resembles less and less what the Founders left us
and looks more and more like the countries our immigrant forefathers tried to get away from. This is
happening in large part because the people who are running this country want it to happen and have
used the enormous powers of the U.S. Government to make it happen.
<P>
But Why? It is all too plain that the people who are running this country deeply dislike the America
of the Founders. If the people who run our Government, our universities, our media, the
entertainment industry, the arts, and the so forth had their way, you and I would be placed in
re-education camps--financed by us, of course--to learn new ways.
<P>
What do the elites of this country have against us? They think our patriotism is unsophisticated at
best, and chauvinistic at worst. They thought our opposition to communism was dangerous and
anti-progressive. The current generation of American leaders thought that we were on the wrong
side in the Vietnam war. Two-thirds of our Congressmen have never served in the Armed Fores.
Military service is the rare exception in the families of those who have the most to say about putting
Americans in harm's way. Many in power say that America is nothing special, and that our troops
ought to do the bidding of the United Nations. Moreover, our patriotism exalts qualities that they
abhor: manliness, righteousness, the capacity to use force.
<P>
Often as not American political elites dislike the American people's prosperity. It is the stated policy
of the U.S. Government that the American people consume too much of the world's energy and
natural resources, that our appetite for automobiles, for meat and comfortable houses, is a drag on
the planet and contributes to poverty in the Third World. So, those who run this country want to tax
us to support the United Nations, and they want us to make cars and industry more expensive. They
think that America suffers from public poverty amidst private luxury, so they want to tax more and to
regulate more, to shift power and wealth to people like themselves. Whether the excuse is
environmentalism, or poverty, or crime, the recipe is always the same: Take money away from
independent working Americans and give it to the favorites of the governing class. It transfers only
power--not solutions, only dependency, not liberty.
<P>
Of course, this is a recipe for economic decline. I would remind the Senate that nowhere in the
writings of the Founding Fathers is there anything about managing the economy. Our Founders
wanted to promote prosperity. So they set about ensuring that Government would be small, frugal,
impartial, and moral. We became a wealth country because Government, in Jefferson's words,
would not `take from the mouth of labor the bread it had earned.' If we abandon the Founders'
mores, no economic policy can keep us out of the poorhouse.
<P>
Our leaders dislike our tradition of self-government. They equate local control of crime with brutality and 
racism. Local zoning is racism. Local control of
schools is racist. We are all racists--except they. The have turned laws that prohibit racial
discrimination into mandates for racial preferences in everything from school admissions to
congressional districting, to hiring and firing and promotions, and contracting, and insurance, and
lending. A whole industry has grown up to administer this American form of apartheid. If you want
your town or business to stay out of trouble nowadays, you need highly paid and well-connected
human relations specialists. Within the U.S. Government, in schools and businesses, there are
mandatory counseling sessions--not unlike under communism.
<P>
Of course this sows racial hatred amongst us. It emboldens young blacks to demand menacingly,
and creates new classes of victims among young whites, Hispanics, Asians and politically
unconnected people in general. But in the end, this has nothing to do with race, and everything to do
with leftist politics. The people who run these programs are white men, who are not about to give up
their own privileges to anybody. In the name of racial justice, and at the price of racial harmony, they
are increasing their own power to privilege their friends at the expense of everyone else, and to
diminish competition for themselves.
<P>
The people who run this country don't care about public safety, having made it very difficult for
States and localities to police themselves, having left ordinary citizens with no choice but to protect
themselves as best they can. They are now trying to take our guns away. In fact they blame us and
our guns for crime. This is so wrong that it cannot be an honest mistake. The don't want safety for
us. The want to strike at our culture.
<P>
The people who run this country don't care that our children are being diseducated or that schools
are becoming factories of ignorance and decay. Every proposal regarding education that has come
out of the establishment has called for more money. Over the past 30 years we have tripled the
amount of money that we pay to the public schools per pupil, in real terms. And guess what? Not
only has educational performance dropped everywhere, but it dropped worst where we spent most.
The places where kids are not being hurt too badly, where test scores are highest, are out in the
sticks--in places like Utah, Iowa, and Wyoming, where the establishment has not yet been able fully
to implement its model of big, bureaucratically controlled districts that give out condoms, banish
prayer, teach self-esteem, and bash all American history prior to the 1960's, maybe we hicks aren't
so stupid after all. But the establishment continues to want money, tries to grab more control, and
keeps looking down on us.
<P>
Above all, the people who run this country have deep contempt and enmity for the culture on which
it rests. What must be the moral priorities of those who run the Democratic National Committee,
who declared that the Christian pro-family movement is the most serious threat to America today?
What vision of America must be in their minds that they are frightened by the prospect of more
moms, dads, and children going to church? Clearly their's is a vision very different from George
Washington's and Abe Lincoln's. And are Republican leaders so different? The tell us we are zealots
if we talk about social issues and about the role of religion in public life. I say, what else is worth
talking about? They say: concentrate on the economy. But prosperity comes from the morality and
sense of responsibility of the population, as well as from small government. It comes from the
culture, not from recipes dreamed up in Government offices or think tanks.
<p>
So how do we safeguard, how do we promote the culture that made us prosperous? Do we do it by
celebrating people who terminate their responsibility to the child they have conceived by killing him
or her and at the same time use Medicaid to provide fertility medicines? Do we say, as Stephen
Douglas said about slavery, that we `don't care' one way or the other? I think Lincoln would warn us 
against expecting that any sort
of prosperity, never mind decency, could be built on such views of responsibility and human life.
Again, can education turn out competent workers, never mind decent citizens, if it continues to stress
condoms over continence and relativism over religion? And again, are we going to be healthy
economically--never mind in other ways--if our establishment keeps on talking and spending as if
alternative families and alternative lifestyles were on the same moral plane as mom, dad and the
kids? Not a chance.
<P>
The sum of all this is that our Government is run by people who are using the powers vested in them
by the Constitution, and the powers that come from spending $1.5 trillion per year of our money to
undo what remains of the culture, the habits, the freedoms that made this country unique. There is a
struggle about what kind of country we will be. Government and its allies in the media, education,
and big business are on the wrong side.
<P>
It is all too easy to list the ways in which the U.S. Government is providing incentives to break up
families, to put generations and races at war with one another, to devalue honest work, to
dumb-down and coarsen children, for bureaucrats to seek their own interest, for businesses to court
regulators, to seek protection, and the public be damned. It is also easy enough, as well as satisfying,
to discuss remedies for all these phenomena.
<P>
We can and should end welfare--not `as we know it.' Just end it, period. Charity for those who
deserve it is something with a long and honorable history. But the short history of welfare tells us that
as a Federal program it does no good, only harm.
<P>
We can and should eliminate Social Security. Just as certainly people who are already retired or
about to retire should get every penny already promised. But just imagine if every penny deducted
from us henceforth went into individual retirement accounts. We could all look forward to a lot more
money, and the Government would have a lot less to spend from day to day.
<P>
For the monsters of Medicare and Medicaid we can and should substitute individual medical savings
accounts, backed up by vouchers.
<P>
We can be rid of the ponderous educational establishment by giving parents vouchers for whatever
amount any level of government taxes them to educate their children.
<P>
We can be rid of the most noxious parts of the university world by cutting all direct aid to higher
education and substituting tuition scholarships to individual students which they must repay. Where
this scheme has been tried, students deserted rotten professors in droves.
<P>
We can stop our tax system's pressure against families by increasing deductions for children.
Perhaps those moms who want to will be able to raise their own children again.
<P>
We can be rid of the terrible bureaucracy of the IRS, and of all the distortive inequities of the system
just by instituting a flat tax.
<P>
We can restore self-government by reducing the power of the Federal courts to review the acts of
State courts and the enactments of State legislatures.
<P>
The objective of these and many other provisions would be to shrink Government and to stop it
from doing further harm.
<P>
The good news is that all these things are double. Sure, the American people are sick enough of big
government and have learned to distrust the establishment so much that a reform program of this
kind stands a chance. The bad news is that no set of legislation or even constitutional amendments is
going to sweep away the entrenched interests and bad habits built up over a generation. Our moral
fiber has been damaged. We are no longer quite the virtuous people for whom the Founding Fathers
wrote the Constitution, the people who fought at Gettysburg and at Omaha Beach. That is why to
set us back on the Founders' path we need moral leadership. By this I mean that we must
understand every change we make above all as a means of restoring the character that made
Americans unique.
<P>
We want to cut taxes not primarily because doing so will put more money in our pockets, but
principally because it will put the means of freedom in our hands. We want to cut the Government's
power to grant privilege not primarily because privilege is economically inefficient, but because we
don't want to be a nation of favor-seekers. We want to keep and bear our guns not because we
want to shoot somebody, but because we have an irreducible right to take care of ourselves. Moral 
leadership, today as in 1789, does not mean that the President of the United States forces anyone to go to 
church or synagogue. But it does mean that by word and deed he leads the country in giving unto God the 
things that are God's. Today according to the current Supreme Court, Abraham Lincoln's proclamation of 
Thanksgiving Day would be unconstitutional. I say that Lincoln knew better, and that recent Supreme 
Court decisions on religion are unconstitutional.
<P>
It is impossible to lay out all the instances in which political leaders can exercise moral leadership
precisely because every act of Government influences our habits in some way. Let us not forget that
the Greek philosophers taught that we are the sum of our habits, and that the Greek word for habits
is `Ethics.' If we want to live like Americans, we had better shun the ethics of the people who are
tearing down this country, and strive for the ethics of those who built it.
<P>
Let me conclude by noting that I have not mentioned the name `Clinton,' and that I mentioned both
the Republican and Democratic Parties as part of the problem. America faces a choice between two
radically opposed views of itself and of the good life. On one side is the view you and I grew up
with, the view of the Founders, the way of life of most families in this country. On the other is the
view you can read in the pages of Time magazine, the New York Times, and the Prestige Press.
This is the view that animates the U.S. Government. The great question of our time is whether
Government will continue to work against the original American way of life, or will switch and
support it as it once did. The only possible way of enabling Government to make this switch, I think,
is to cut it down to a small fraction of its current size. Now, this is an issue that transcends parties. It
is an issue that, most likely, will cause a realignment of Parties, or even the death of one or both of
our current parties and the birth of a new one. The more secular we have become the more we pray
to Government for that which we once prayed to God. Nothing happens anymore. Everything is
caused and is therefore to someone's credit or blame. This is nonsense and is unsustainable policy.
Decency yields no more credit than indecency. How can we sustain families on this notion?
<P>
All of that is not so important. The only important thing is that the American people and the
American way of life be defended against their enemies, and that they be defended worthily.
<P>
In all my public life, nothing has cheered and sustained me as much as the constantly recurring
evidence of the good sense and virtue of the American people. And nothing has angered and
dispirited me more than politicians' and other so called elites' disdain for the average American.
<P>
I recall that during the first half of the Vietnam war, the wise men of foreign policy, from McGeorge
Bundy to George Ball, were belittling the American people's demand, echoed by Barry Goldwater,
that we win the war or get out. No, they said. This insistence on victory is simplistic, unsophisticated,
outdated, and lacking in maturity. In our modern age, victory is impossible but involvement is
inevitable. Knowledgeable professionals, namely themselves, were going to adjust the conflict to a
mutually acceptable solution, if only the children of lesser Americans--not their own--would continue
to get themselves shot. Then in the second half of the war, as well as after the war, these same
people told us that our militarism had pushed us in, that we had gotten the lesson we deserved, but
that now we, the American people, had become incapable of supporting a meaningful foreign policy,
namely one led by them.
<P>
This was Henry Kissinger's constant theme in the 1970's. Remember the tones of Spenglerian gloom
with which he justified renouncing the United States' right to protect itself against ballistic missiles?
The weakness of the American people made him do it. By the same token, during the 1980s, from
Strobe Talbott in Time magazine as well as from Harvard and Stanford, we heard how dangerously
stupid the American people were to harken to Ronald Reagan's call to defend this country and to
relegate the Soviet Union to the dustbin of history. The elites knew better--or thought they did. Now
the same people decry as neo-isolationism the elites' call to send the children of average
Americans--surely not their own--to so-called peace-keeping and nation-building missions.
Meanwhile they strip this country's military while their bungling diplomacy stores up future troubles.
And they wonder why the American people think foreign policy is a mess?
<P>
Well, the American people lack neither wisdom nor the capacity for generous sacrifice. The same
year the people of Wyoming sent me to Washington, the country also elected Jimmy Carter. Carter
had campaigned for `A government as good as its people.' He had seemed to reject the
establishment's prescriptions for America's managed decline, most eloquently expressed by Henry
Kissinger. Sadly, he brought in a wing of the establishment that was even further out of sympathy
with America. Almost the same can be said of the
American people's choice of Bill Clinton my point is this: the American people always vote for the
Presidential candidate who seems to embody the old American virtues, the traditional, common
sense view of America in the world. More often than not, alas, politicians have not been worthy of
the people's trust. They have drawn on the well of the American people's generous patriotism, but
have done nothing to refill it. Thank God that well is deep.
<P>
Today it is fashionable among Republican as well as Democratic elites to ascribe the ills of big
government to the American people's supposedly insatiable appetite for government checks and
privileges, combined with their miserly unwillingness to pay for them. According to what one can
hear from practically every talking head in the mainstream media, pork and corruption are
demand-side problems. The politicians and their bureaucratic allies are innocent, just following
orders.
<P>
This is nonsense. The social programs that have done so much harm to this country have been sold
to the American people with false pretenses. Sometimes the very names of the programs are
Orwellian reversals of reality--none more so than `aid to families with dependent children.' Who
would have voted for Social Security if it had been presented as what it is, a chain letter, a ponzi
scheme, that spends the workers money the moment it comes in, and that cannot return it unless
each generation is taxed more heavily than the previous one? Who would have voted for Medicare if
it had been made clear that this would bureaucratize and render much more expensive all health care
in America? And who the heck voted for the Supreme Court decisions that ended America's
tradition of local self-government, and made pornography, abortion, and vagrancy into basic rights
while pushing religion out of public life? Who ever voted to institute a system of racial classification in
this country? Certainly not the American people. All of these things are anathema to the average
American.
<P>
But now comes the crucial questions: How long can any people, no matter how virtuous, remain
uncorrupted when governed by laws and elites that tend to corrupt? This week's New York Times
carries an account of widespread tax evasion in Germany. In Germany? That most order-loving of
countries? Buy why? Simply because it seems that tax burden has grown so great that the people
think it unreasonable. There is no doubt that our own laws and administration, fiscal and otherwise,
have become so burdensome and unreasonable that our own tradition of law-abiding is fading.
<P>
There is no doubt that entitlements and privileges corrupt those who give and those who receive
them, whether they are rich or poor. This list of threats to the American people's virtue is long. No
one can say how long the character and habits bequeathed to us by the Founding Fathers will last
and whether they will vanquish the threats or be overcome by them.
<P>
The size our continent, its fabulous wealth, its indescribable beauty, the ships, tanks, and airplanes in
our arsenal, are no treasure compared to the moral character of the American people. I pray to God
that he will graciously help us preserve and improve it.

While most sites on the World Wide Web request support of $25, $50 or more, the Frontiers of Freedom Institute would like to spend some quality months building our reputation and earning your respect.

<P><b>Therefore, we are asking for $1.  One dollar.</b>  It may not sound like a great deal of money to you, but frankly, thousands of web users log on to our site every week.  If everyone who viewed our site sent us $1, then we could continue producing quality conservative studies, conferences, and op-eds.  Of course, not everyone will send us $1.  However, we can only hope that this material is of concern enough for many people to simply slip a one dollar bill in an envelope and send it to us.  We will put it to constructive use.  It will allow us to continue moving the ball forward in the debate of conservative and limited government principles versus liberal big government dogma.
<P>
Certainly, if our op-eds and mission statement speak to you in a more passionate and personal way, we encourage you to think about a more substantial gift.
<P><blockquote><I>
For now, however, your support of $1 makes the philosophical connection between our organization and you.  It is a symbolic way of saying -- "Youre doing well.  Continue the fight."</blockquote></I><P>

<H1><B>FREE's Mission Statement</B></H1>
<P>FREE is a research and educational foundation.  Its purpose is to advance conservation and environmental values consistent with individual freedom and responsibility.  We develop and advocate environmental policies whose goals are realized through private property rights, market incentives, and voluntary organizations.  </P>
<P>Free works with leaders in universities, businesses, environmental groups, government, the media, and think-tanks.  We conduct seminars and conferences, sponsor and write books and articles, and organize special issues of magazines.  </P>
<P>Our most valuable contributions to public policy and the economy come from our incentive-based, free-enterprise alternatives to the policies of the collective environmentalists.  FREE works with a substantial number of academics and writers who hold principled commitments to the ideals of America's Founding Fathers.  These individuals have earned the respect of the policy community for their intellectual integrity and independence.</P>
<P>Essentially, FREE provides an organized forum for developing and debating approaches to ecological issues consistent with the classical liberal values of free enterprise and individual responsibility.  FREE analyses proposals of environmentalists who reject markets and incentives in favor of a bureaucratic, command-and-control approach.  Many professional policy analysts agree that we have earned the intellectual high ground.</P>
<P>Now that all politicians claim to be environmentalists, and the &quot;green&quot; movement is picking up great momentum, their is huge potential for mischief.  Environmental quality can be harmonized with a society of free and responsible individuals.  FREE shows how these goals can go together.  At this time, support for FREE's work is an especially important investment in the public policy arena.</P>  <!--FOOT--><HR>

<H1>Cowboys of the Old West Need to Clean up Their Act</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>
<P>
The cowboy symbolizes the American West and universal manly virtues.  For a few decades these rugged individualists ran roughshod over the wild expanse of the West, herding cattle, taming broncs, and working dawn to dusk.  In myth, the cowboy still is the West at its best.
</P>
<P>
But times they are a changing.  The West isn't so vast and wild any more.  Thanks to technology, the hours aren't as long, and the winters are more bearable.  Today's cowboys are surrounded by subdivisions, ski resorts, and silicon chips.  In many areas where cattle were dominant, service industries and high technology now swamp the economic significance of cattle.
</P>

<P>
The cowboy is increasingly branded as a historical artifact, environmentally damaging and politically incorrect.  He seems grossly inappropriate for the twenty-first century.  These criticisms are loudest after catastrophes such as the recent floods.
</P>
<P>
One articulate critic, the popular and highly successful nature and travel author George Wuerthner, of Eugene, Oregon, saw cow-caused calamity:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
"There's no doubt it rained a lot, but what isn't readily recognized is how human resource extraction industries may have exacerbated the situation, indirectly contributing to the severity and economic losses 'precipitated' by the recent storms. 
</P>
<P>
"Livestock grazing, perhaps more than any other factor, has contributed to the 'record' floods. It is made even more pernicious since it's the least appreciated human-related impact upon watersheds.
</P>

<P>
"Our domestic cattle breeds evolved in moist woodlands in Eurasian, yet we often attempt to raise them in arid, desert and semi-desert environments.  But this comes at a cost not often recognized by most people. 
</P>

<P>
"Due to their high water needs, and desire for lush, green forage, cattle trample, stomp, and chomp western riparian zones into oblivion.  Riparian areas are the thin green lines of water-dependent vegetation that border streams, seeps, and springs in the West.
</P>

<P>
"Beside being critical for wildlife--with some 70-80% of all species dependent upon them to some degree or another--riparian areas are also one of the major natural 'flood control' mechanisms in nature. 
</P>

<P>
"A healthy riparian zone holds streams banks together, allows stream water to access its natural flood plain, thus dissipating downstream flows, and absorbs water like a giant sponge.  A healthy riparian area reduces a flood peak, and slows the passage of water through a watershed, giving the land time to absorb and dissipate the high flows. 
</P>

<P>
"Unlike healthy riparian areas, cow blasted streams can't access their flood plains--instead water races downstream as a 'flood.'  With little vegetation to hold the banks together, streams channels are torn asunder, causing channel straightening and widening--again contributing to downstream floods.  Finally, in a cow-blasted stream and watershed, water can't soak into compacted banks and soils and runs off in giant sheets, leading to greater peak flows."
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
As Wuerthner explains, too many cows can increase our susceptibility to floods.  Cowboys and their cows may have had free reign of the old West, but the massive flooding of 1997 demonstrates the costs.  Writers such as Wuerthner see the cowboy not for his manly attributes but rather as an environmental vandal imposing serious costs on the environment, taxpayers, and local communities.
</P>

<P>
These outcries against cows and cowboys discount culture, social organization, and rural values.  Environmentalists routinely lambaste economists' myopic fixation on efficiency over humanity.  Are they making an analogous mistake?
</P>

<P>
The cowboy and his accouterments still figure heavily in Western fashion, music, tourism, and old town saloons.  Cowboys influence commerce far beyond the stockyard.  Only a trivially small proportion of horse trailers are sold to genuine cowboys or stockmen.  The great majority are parked on ranchettes or even smaller parcels.
</P>

<P>
Yet the romantic charm of the cowboy seems indelible.  Successful urbanites buy into the culture when they purchase their ranchettes.  Dude ranches punctuate the West, like mini-theme parks and each year they raise their rates in response to demand.  This year in Montana, individuals will pay over $1500 for a weekend at a guest ranch.  The cowboy is not gone.  Cows remain, and his legacy is felt throughout the West.  His mystique still captures America's imagination.
</P>

<P>
But the cowboy's legacy is eroded when the old myth hits ecological and hydrological realities.  Competent and impassioned writers such as Wuerthner blow the whistle and cry foul when environmental damage floods the six o'clock news.  Edward Abbey writes, "Western cattlemen are nothing more than welfare parasites.  They been getting a free ride on the public lands for over a century, and I think it's time we phased it out."
</P>

<P>
The West needs a new cowboy, one who tolerates the wolf in Yellowstone Park, the grizzly bear in northern Idaho, and the jaguar in New Mexico.  To survive he must adapt his practices to the environmental sensitivities of the Next West.  
</P>

<P>
Adapting our vision of the cowboy requires exploding some myths and building them anew.  The cowboy as steward of rangelands and riparian zones, rather than their conquerer, is the place to start.

<P><FONT SIZE=6>T</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>he slogan in the 1994 election was "It's the economy, stupid."  In the 1996 election, environmentalists tried to update this to: "It's the environment, stupid."  After all, the environmental record of the 104th Congress is so misguided that even seasoned observers are left wondering if members of the Republican party are indeed brain damaged.</FONT>
</P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Perhaps they misinterpreted the polls.  A <A HREF="http://www.roper.com">Roper Starch</A> poll shows that most Americans are extremely or very satisfied with their community's air and water quality.  Only 8 percent of young voters consider the environment a high priority in voting.  According to a recent <A HREF="http://www.cei.org">Competitive Enterprise Institute</A> poll, less than 5 percent of voters identified environmental concerns as "the single most important problem facing the country."  The same percentage said the "most important problem" is President Clinton.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Compared to other issues, the environment takes a back seat.  An August 17, 1996 Newsweek poll indicates that only 42 percent all of Americans consider the environment one of the most important issues in the upcoming Presidential election, compared to 74 percent for the economy and 70 percent for crime.  Likewise, a <A HREF="http://www.nwf.org/nwf/home.html">National Wildlife Federation </A> poll found that the environment influences 54 percent of voters, while education affects 76 percent.  Shrewd politicians might disregard the relavtively weak support for the environment and focus on bigger issues, like crime, health care, or education.  Sound policies on these issues, they may have calculated, will garner them more votes come election.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Yet by and large, Americans are environmentalists.  A deeper look at the pools reveals this.  Politicians who ignore the pervasive pro-environmental sentiments are in peril. 
</P>
<P>
<UL><LI>Three-fourths of Americans consider the environment a "high" priority.  
<LI>84 percent of American voters consider environmental issues to be important in the upcoming Presidential election.  
<LI><A HREF="http://www.colostate.edu/">Colorado State University</A> pollsters found that 96 percent of voters consider candidates' commitment to national parks when voting.  
<LI>Four out of five Americans consider themselves to be environmentalists or sympathetic to environmentalists.  </UL>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
	Together, such a broad-based consensus among American voters is both rare and powerful.  Everybody wants a better environment.  Campaigning against such eco-topian sentiments is foolish and, in today's world, increasingly impossible.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
But this didn't stop the Republican-dominated 104th Congress.  The traditional practice of subsidizing natural resource extraction industries continued unabated and even gained momentum -- often at the expense of both the taxpayer and the environment.  Grazing fees were lowered.  Salvage logging was expedited.  The Endangered Species Act came under fire.  Many regulatory burdens and standards were eased.  The Environmental Protection Agency's substantial decline in enforcement actions was blamed on the 104th Congress forcing a federal government shutdown.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Environmental protection took a back seat to Republican efforts to dismantle the existing regulatory system and replace it with one more advantageous to vested interests.  Timber industries finally had renewed access to old growth trees.  Northwestern utilities benefited from exemptions to the Endangered Species Act and Republican opposition to plans to divert more river water for salmon preservation. 
</P><IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="/free/Images/Scape.gif" WIDTH=328 HEIGHT=241>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
The FY 1996 budget passed by the 104th Congress and signed by President Clinton actually increased federal support for U.S. agricultural interests and power utilities.  The Clinton Administration bailed out the beef industry with $50 million in school lunch purchases and by releasing 36 million acres of rangeland for grazing.  Clinton also bailed out Alaskan salmon fishers with school lunch purchases and gasoline consumers by releasing national oil reserves.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Congress attempted to expand the subsidized logging in Alaska's Tongass National Forest.  The Mojave National Preserve was also opened up to mining and commercial development by the 104th Congress.  And, the Presidio national park in San Francisco was very popular among Congressmen from both parties.  This one-time military base has been converted into an office park, the most expensive park in the entire <A HREF="http://www.nps.gov/">National Park System</A>.  There were almost no objections to spending money here or in other regional "park barrel" projects.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Attempts at genuine reform demanded that Republicans confront orthodox command-and-control environmentalism.  However, extreme spokespeople like <A HREF="http://www.state.ak.us/local/akpages/CONGRESS/youngpg.htm">Don Young</A> of Alaska and <A HREF="http://www.vote-smart.org/congress/id/id-01-a/">Helen Chenoweth</A> of Idaho undermined the credibility of their reform.  They and their "wise use" constituents paraded under the banner of free enterprise while demanding a continuation of subsidies for outmoded, environmentally destructive exploitation of resources on public lands.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Despite the merits of some of their changes, we can see why the Republicans were branded "anti-environmentalist".  Almost everybody favors environmental protection; the big difference is in how we achieve it.  Voters did not reject environmental goals in the 1994 election.  Rather they found repugnant the statist, bureaucratic, command-and-control means to green ends exemplified by the EPA's approach to wetlands and its management of Superfund sites.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Although the 104th Congress capitalized on their majority, they failed to articulate a vision linking economy with ecology.  They ultimately supported traditional, subsidized destruction of natural resources.  Under Republican leadership, oil interests gained, timber companies gained, hydroelectric utilities and ranchers benefited, and commercial fishermen were favored for the short run.  Republicans brought home the pork to industries that extracted natural resources, industries long ago left behind in a rapidly changing West.  Instead of a "new vision" for a new America, the Republican majority bolstered traditional political and special interests.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
The 1996 election failed to either affirm the Republican attack on environmentalism or give environmentalists a mandate over the resource extractionists.  The reason is that both sides are confused about the true nature of our resource problems.
</P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Republican Platforms At Cross Purposes</H2></FONT>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
<FONT SIZE=5>T</FONT>he Republican's position on the environment is opportunistic and counterproductive in the long run.  Here's why:
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Some non-environmental reforms hold great promise for improving America's economy and citizens' well-being.  School choice is coming and will improve the education and welfare of Americans everywhere.  With improvements in education and entrepreneurial innovation, hard-working Americans will be more productive.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Successes will ultimately conflict with Rupublicans' lack of environmental sensitivity.  Across time and across space, as wealth and education increase so does environmental sensitivity.  If Republican reforms successfully improve the education and increase the prosperity of Americans, then demand for environmental quality will increase.  As Americans become richer, they will demand ever more environmental protection.  As Don Coursey, Dean of the <A HREF="http://www.spc.uchicago.edu/orgs/gspps/">Harris School of Public Policy</A> at the University of Chicago, has demonstrated, the elasticity of demand for environmental quality is the same as for BMWs and foreign travel.  As income rises 1 percent, demand for environmental quality increases 2.5 percent.
</P><A HREF="http://www.free-eco.org/free/FP/Pasture.gif"><IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="/free/FP/Pasture.gif" WIDTH=321 HEIGHT=144></A>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
But we've already seen the Republican party line sell out the environment to parochial special interests, outmoded extractive industries, and regional subsidies.  Protecting favored industries and constituents undermines environmental quality.  Making Americans wealthier and wiser will only increase their abhorrence for these policies.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
<I>Simply put, the Republican environmental platform is at cross purposes with its domestic agenda.</I>  Rolling back environmental protections is not only inconsistent with making a prosperous, educated nation, it appears diametrically opposed.  They've set up a no-win situation.  Republican success in one arena will be turned against them in another.  Rich, (sub)urbanite, well-educated Americans will demand environmental quality if not "eco-topia".  Instead, Republicans offer them ethanol subsidies, salvage logging, and lax efforts to preserve endangered species.
</P>
<FONT COLOR="3A3ABD">
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Environmentalists Equally Confused</H2></FONT>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
<FONT SIZE=5>I</FONT>ronically, the Republicans' weaknesses are precisely the flip-side of shortcomings of the traditional environmentalist position.  Where the GOP fights for economic progress even at the expense of higher environmental standards, the environmental camp has been willing to sacrifice economic development for environmental quality.  For nearly two decades, this environmental dogma has reigned largely without challenge.  The traditional environmentalist agenda relied on greater bureaucratic powers, increased federal control, and heightened paranoia over environmental problems.  Since the first Earth Day, the means to environmental goals were federal management, political mandates, and stringent regulations.  They have imposed costs on everyone and pitted the environment against prosperity, rather than harmonizing these two complementary values.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Some environmental gains were well worth the costs.  But ever-increasing environmental regulation ultimately costs society more than it benefits.  In <CITE>Breaking the Vicious Circle</CITE>, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer identifies the rising costs of regulations like CAFE fuel economy requirements, EPA restrictions on benzene, and Superfund.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Inflexible and exorbitantly expensive regulations are predictable consequences of separating power from responsibility.  When pollution is free to polluters, we get too much pollution.  Likewise, when regulations are free to the regulators, we get too much regulation.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
It's irresponsible to ignore trade-offs inherent in every policy.  Pursuing environmental goals with what Justice Breyer calls "tunnel vision" will squander billions of dollars.  This process will also trample individuals, communities, and even endangered species.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
The Framers of the Constitution understood these pathologies of interventionist, command-and-control government.  After 200 years of American history and 25 years of traditional environmentalism, we are finally re-learning our Founding Fathers' lessons.
</P>
<FONT COLOR="3A3ABD">
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">A New Environmental Vision</H2></FONT>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
<FONT SIZE=5>A</FONT> new environmental vision is emerging which learns from the shortcomings of both the orthodox environmentalism and the reactionary Republican (anti)environmentalism.  This new vision stresses the importance of harmonizing environmental quality and economic well-being.  Such a vision should hold great appeal for politicians whose constituents are increasingly environmentally sensitive and whose supporters are increasingly aware of their interdependence with the environment.  An April, 1996 Roper Starch poll indicates that sixty-six percent of Americans believe that environmental protection, economic growth and the health and happiness of communities can be achieved simultaneously.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
The environmental movement now stands, potentially, on the threshold to a new vision, a new orthodoxy.  This environmental perspective seeks to improve environmental quality through well tested but generally misunderstood principles.  They rely on:
</P>
<UL><LI>Prosperity and environmental quality go together.
<LI>Different systems promote different results.  There is no one perfect system.
<LI>It is impossible to do just one thing.  
<LI>There are no solutions, only trade-offs.
<LI>Incentives influence behavior.
<LI>Various institutions differ significantly in the information and incentives they provide.
<LI>Resources are conserved when decision-makers are held accountable.
<LI>Scarcity requires rationing.  Allocation by political means exacerbates scarcity and erode ethics.
<LI>Nothing of value is free.  Entrepreneurial innovation can give us greater value from equal or fewer resources, but imagination is neither free nor can it be taken for granted. 
<LI>Features which characterize ecological systems, such as evolution, decentralization, and adaptability, can guide policy reform.  Ecological systems are much like economic systems.  Shared principles provide the key for a new environmental vision.</UL>

<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Politicians of any political party will be able to capture the spirit and the benefits of this environmentalism by articulating such a vision.  The 104th Congress is indeed cowardly when they accept a milder version of orthodox environmentalism or when they continue the old, pork-barrel subsidies.  They also seem dim-witted when they fail to articulate an alternative environmental vision which promotes environmental goals and economic development in harmony.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Some political entrepreneur will catalyze a new era of environmentalism -- a new shade of green.  Taking control away from bureaucracies and their advocates (be they industry or environmentalist) means allowing flexible adaptation to govern environmental stewardship.  <A HREF="http://www.tnc.org/">The Nature Conservancy </A> demonstrates flexible, innovative responses to Americans' demands for stewardship.  The Nature Conservancy has tripled the acres it protects in the last 10 years by stressing its decentralized, local approach.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
What the 104th Congress ought to have done, and what politically savvy successors will attempt to do, is reject the command-and-control environmentalist model at the same time they discard the financially and environmentally wasteful subsidies.  Risking political capital in this way will earn politicians the support of the public, of businesses, and, most importantly, of the voters.  Perhaps the biggest threat to environments, economies, and communities are federal pork projects and using government as an engine of plunder.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
The new environmental vision would advocate new strategies to bring economic prosperity and environmental quality into unison.  In the place of regulatory, bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all, top down solutions, it would introduce decentralized, incentive- and community-based, market-oriented tradeoffs.
</P>
<FONT COLOR="3A3ABD">
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Rewarding Environmental Entrepreneurs</H2></FONT>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
<FONT SIZE=5>T</FONT>he political climate today should favor, rather than punish, environmental entrepreneurs.  Politicians should encourage innovative efforts to "tread lightly" on the earth.  We can reform institutions to reward environmental sensitivity.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Until recently, environmental entrepreneurship has been ignored or punished.  This was not the appropriate direction for the environmental movement.  The movement is undergoing a wrenching change.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Recently, <A HREF="http://www.hispanic.org/coors.htm">Adolph Coors Company</A> in Golden, Colorado voluntarily conducted a self-audit of its environmental impact.  The 17-month audit which cost Coors $1.5 million discovered previously unknown emissions in the brewing process.  These emissions were not covered by environmental regulations but far exceeded all of the company's other emissions.  When Coors disclosed this information as a step to obtain permits, the Colorado Department of Health and the Environment fined Coors more than $1 million for their troubles.  
</P><IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="/free/Images/Briefcase.gif" WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=171>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
The message of these incentives was perverse: don't be a good citizen -- hide, don't disclose.  Nearly half of the companies recently surveyed by Price Waterhouse expressed reluctance to conduct self-audits because they feared possible punishment.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Coors' observation that "voluntary initiatives are more effective than mandated actions because they create flexible solutions, foster innovation and promote collaboration rather than adversarial relationships" merits the close attention of reformers.  Voluntary activities like Coors' clearly foster environmental quality.  Since 1988, Coors has lightened its bottles, cans, and packing by 21 percent and reduced its contribution to landfills by 850,000 tons.  In 1994 alone, Coors re-used 964,359 tons of packaging materials.  And they saved money in the process.  As the <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/PCSD">President's Council on Sustainable Development</A> recently reported, "Pollution is waste, waste is inefficient, and inefficiency is expensive."
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
"Cyberfarms" are another excellent example of entrepreneurial innovation fostering environmental quality and economic progress.  Satellite-based Global Position Systems (GPS) track variations in elevation, soil composition, weather, and productivity -- down to the square foot.  Cyberfarmers can then make minute adjustments in seeding, fertilizing, and irrigating their fields.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
In addition to being more productive, cyberfarmers have a "green" thumb.  With GPS technology farmers no longer need to uniformly blanket their fields with pesticides, water, fertilizer, and other potentially environmentally damaging inputs.  Now they can target specific amounts to the areas where they'll be most beneficial.  They save money on chemicals while reducing their use of insecticides, herbicides, and water.  High-technology farming helps meet the growing demands of a hungry planet by reducing our use of the land itself.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
As another example, "Cybercommuting" allows workers to work from home, to transmit projects and ideas instantaneously across long distances, and even to develop "virtual offices".  Technological progress makes possible new, environmentally friendly ways to work by decreasing costs and increasing productivity.  Conversely, environmentally sensitive commuting and communicating leads to economic gains.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
More and more, economic development comes from innovating new technologies and business practices -- not discovering more natural resources to conquest.  By encouraging "green" entrepreneurs, we can continue to find better ways to detatch ourselves from the environment. Whether their green thumb grows better crops with satellites or hitches a ride to work on the Internet, their creative resources need to be tapped.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
We can learn from Coors, cyberfarms, and cybercommuters.  They represent efforts to harmonize economic progress and environmental protection.  They reject the romantic "return to nature" dictum and offer economic progress through environmentally sensitive innovations.  Environmentalists finally recognize that environmental protection increases because of, not in spite of, economic prosperity.

<FONT SIZE=5>T</FONT>he time is ripe for this new environmental vision to reshape our institutions.  Our experiments in command-and-control environmentalism and Progressive Era resource management have run their course and proven financially and environmentally bankrupt.  Sylvan socialism, as embodied in the <A HREF="http://www.fs.fed.us/">US Forest Service</A>, epitomizes the failures of central federal planners to act as sensitive stewards of the environment. The progressive management practices of private timber companies have surpassed the USFS, while the federal government incurs $1 billion in annual net losses each year.  As we prepare to celebrate the centennial of the Forest Service, it is incumbent on us to consider the deficiencies of the socialist model
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Environmentalism is becoming an increasingly salient political issue.  The means at our disposal for dealing with environmental threats are improving every day.  We need to tap into and foster these human resources, so that we don't depend on natural ones so much.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
In order to unleash that entrepreneurial creativity to foster harmony with nature, we need political entrepreneurs.  These public policy entrepreneurs stand to gain immense political capital for themselves if they can articulate such a cohesive environmentalism.  They can implement reforms at the federal level to correct the fundamental flaws in public land management agencies, wasteful regulatory quagmires like the ESA, EPA, and others, and environmentally destructive federal subsidies.  Creating new institutions in their place, following the principles outlined above, holds the best key to satisfying the growing environmental interests as well as the business community.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
The intellectual tide is shifting.  The paradigm for the environmental movement is being rewritten.  In October of 1993 a new benchmark of environmental thinking was established at Airlie House.  Leading conservationists from around the world concluded that despite elaborate efforts the conventional approach to conservation wasn't working.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Their new strategy emphasized positive local participation, not prescription and enforcement alone.  They sought ways to make local communities the beneficiaries and custodians of conservation efforts.  The phrase "community-based conservation" captures the essence of their approach.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Their "View from Airlie" (published by the Liz Claiborne and Art Ortenberg Foundation) offers an innovative perspective on effective and viable protection of ecological values.  This is progress.  We've tried command and control and found it wanting.  It's time for community-based conservation and for rethinking environmentalism.  (The complete proceedings of the Airlie conference were published in a 1994 Island Press book titled <CITE>Natural Connections</CITE>, edited by David Western and R. Michael Wright.)
</P>
<P>
The environmental movement born at the first Earth Day had noble goals.  It's well-intentioned policy prescriptions, however, were fatally flawed.  It's very difficult and extremely rare to get public policy right the first time.  The lessons learned from traditional environmentalism are helping to elaborate a new, evolved environmentalism that recognizes and appreciates environmental entrepreneurs.

<H1>Cowboys of the Old West Need to Clean up Their Act</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>
<P>
The cowboy symbolizes the American West and universal manly virtues.  For a few decades these rugged individualists ran roughshod over the wild expanse of the West, herding cattle, taming broncs, and working dawn to dusk.  In myth, the cowboy still is the West at its best.
</P>
<P>
But times they are a changing.  The West isn't so vast and wild any more.  Thanks to technology, the hours aren't as long, and the winters are more bearable.  Today's cowboys are surrounded by subdivisions, ski resorts, and silicon chips.  In many areas where cattle were dominant, service industries and high technology now swamp the economic significance of cattle.
</P>

<P>
The cowboy is increasingly branded as a historical artifact, environmentally damaging and politically incorrect.  He seems grossly inappropriate for the twenty-first century.  These criticisms are loudest after catastrophes such as the recent floods.
</P>
<P>
One articulate critic, the popular and highly successful nature and travel author George Wuerthner, of Eugene, Oregon, saw cow-caused calamity:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
"There's no doubt it rained a lot, but what isn't readily recognized is how human resource extraction industries may have exacerbated the situation, indirectly contributing to the severity and economic losses 'precipitated' by the recent storms. 
</P>
<P>
"Livestock grazing, perhaps more than any other factor, has contributed to the 'record' floods. It is made even more pernicious since it's the least appreciated human-related impact upon watersheds.
</P>

<P>
"Our domestic cattle breeds evolved in moist woodlands in Eurasian, yet we often attempt to raise them in arid, desert and semi-desert environments.  But this comes at a cost not often recognized by most people. 
</P>

<P>
"Due to their high water needs, and desire for lush, green forage, cattle trample, stomp, and chomp western riparian zones into oblivion.  Riparian areas are the thin green lines of water-dependent vegetation that border streams, seeps, and springs in the West.
</P>

<P>
"Beside being critical for wildlife--with some 70-80% of all species dependent upon them to some degree or another--riparian areas are also one of the major natural 'flood control' mechanisms in nature. 
</P>

<P>
"A healthy riparian zone holds streams banks together, allows stream water to access its natural flood plain, thus dissipating downstream flows, and absorbs water like a giant sponge.  A healthy riparian area reduces a flood peak, and slows the passage of water through a watershed, giving the land time to absorb and dissipate the high flows. 
</P>

<P>
"Unlike healthy riparian areas, cow blasted streams can't access their flood plains--instead water races downstream as a 'flood.'  With little vegetation to hold the banks together, streams channels are torn asunder, causing channel straightening and widening--again contributing to downstream floods.  Finally, in a cow-blasted stream and watershed, water can't soak into compacted banks and soils and runs off in giant sheets, leading to greater peak flows."
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
As Wuerthner explains, too many cows can increase our susceptibility to floods.  Cowboys and their cows may have had free reign of the old West, but the massive flooding of 1997 demonstrates the costs.  Writers such as Wuerthner see the cowboy not for his manly attributes but rather as an environmental vandal imposing serious costs on the environment, taxpayers, and local communities.
</P>

<P>
These outcries against cows and cowboys discount culture, social organization, and rural values.  Environmentalists routinely lambaste economists' myopic fixation on efficiency over humanity.  Are they making an analogous mistake?
</P>

<P>
The cowboy and his accouterments still figure heavily in Western fashion, music, tourism, and old town saloons.  Cowboys influence commerce far beyond the stockyard.  Only a trivially small proportion of horse trailers are sold to genuine cowboys or stockmen.  The great majority are parked on ranchettes or even smaller parcels.
</P>

<P>
Yet the romantic charm of the cowboy seems indelible.  Successful urbanites buy into the culture when they purchase their ranchettes.  Dude ranches punctuate the West, like mini-theme parks and each year they raise their rates in response to demand.  This year in Montana, individuals will pay over $1500 for a weekend at a guest ranch.  The cowboy is not gone.  Cows remain, and his legacy is felt throughout the West.  His mystique still captures America's imagination.
</P>

<P>
But the cowboy's legacy is eroded when the old myth hits ecological and hydrological realities.  Competent and impassioned writers such as Wuerthner blow the whistle and cry foul when environmental damage floods the six o'clock news.  Edward Abbey writes, "Western cattlemen are nothing more than welfare parasites.  They been getting a free ride on the public lands for over a century, and I think it's time we phased it out."

The West needs a new cowboy, one who tolerates the wolf in Yellowstone Park, the grizzly bear in northern Idaho, and the jaguar in New Mexico.  To survive he must adapt his practices to the environmental sensitivities of the Next West.  
</P>

<P>
Adapting our vision of the cowboy requires exploding some myths and building them anew.  The cowboy as steward of rangelands and riparian zones, rather than their conquerer, is the place to start.

<P>
<DD><B>Alexandria, VA</B> -- The television networks substantially increased the number of labels they
applied to Democrats during their 1996 convention over 1992, but at both the Republican and
Democratic conventions this year the networks demanded answers to a barrage of questions from
the left. For Republicans gathered in San Diego, GOP intolerance on abortion was the issue. For
Democrats convened in Chicago, going too far to the right on welfare reform became the media
focus. Adding up both questions and statements made by reporters to one another, abortion or
exclusion of pro-choice voices were raised as an issue 55 times in San Diego, while viewers
heard about welfare reform 43 times in Chicago.
<BR>
<DD>After producing a daily Media Reality Check '96 newsletter during the August political
conventions, the Media Research Center's (MRC) news division staff organized its analysis of
prime time coverage into this special 15-page report. This analysis covers ABC, CBS, CNN
(starting at 8pm ET), NBC and the joint NBC/PBS broadcast. Key findings:
<BR>
<h4>Democrats labeled liberal more often than Republicans tagged conservative.</h4><BR>
 Studies of the 1984,
1988 and 1992 conventions found Republicans labeled much more frequently than Democrats. In
1992, the MRC determined the networks applied 118 conservative labels during the GOP conclave,
but just 38 liberal labels during the Democratic gathering. This year, Republicans were tagged
59 times (13 moderate, 30 conservative, and 16 more extremist terms), but Democrats were labeled
119 times (44 moderate, 71 liberal and four more extremist terms).
<BR>
<DD>In Chicago, Bill Clinton got 28 moderate labels and captured about half as many liberal tags
with 16. In San Diego, the networks focused most of their labeling on conservative delegates and
speakers as Bob Dole went largely untagged -- three moderate and two conservative labels. The
Republican platform was never called moderate and the Democratic platform was never described as
liberal. See page 3 for a summary table and graph, pages 6-14 for examples.
<BR>
<h4>Convention attendees pummeled with questions from the left side of the political
spectrum.</h4><br> On 51 occasions in San Diego Republicans were hit with questions from the left,
especially about intolerance and abortion, but they heard just six inquiries from the right. Two
weeks later instead of questioning Democrats from the right, the networks posed 47 from the
left, the vast majority on how many Democrats opposed President Clinton's decision to sign the
welfare reform bill, but just 11 questions from the right. In this area the networks have grown
more biased. Four years ago, while the GOP got the same treatment, hearing 131 questions from
the left compared to 17 from the right, Democrats got a more even going over with 46 questions
from the left and 38 from the right. See page 4 for a table and graph, pages 7-15 for examples.
<BR>
<h4>Republicans blamed repeatedly for displaying a negative tone, but Democrats go unscathed despite
some pretty vitriolic speeches.</h4>
<BR>In San Diego the networks characterized Republicans with terms
like "negative," "harsh," "strident" or "mean" or described GOP speeches as an "attack," 34
times. Democrats were hit with the negative descriptions just six times during their convention,
but even in Chicago Republicans got hammered more with 23 references to GOP negativity. In 1992,
the networks questioned the Republican tone as too negative 70 times, but never once raised the
subject against Democrats at their convention. See page 5 for a summary table and examples of
the contrast.
<BR>
<h4>Controversies such as Whitewater and Travelgate barely acknowledged.</h4><br> The Clintons are under
active investigation by an independent counsel, but the networks made only seven references to
Democratic scandals. NBC and the joint NBC-PBS broadcast aired two mentions; ABC, CBS, and CNN,
only one. Topics never mentioned: the FBI files scandal, the Iran-Bosnia scandal, and the
special counsel investigations of Cabinet members such as Henry Cisneros and Mike Espy.
Controversies about Republicans, such as questions about Elizabeth Dole's blind trust, were also
ignored.

<BR>
<DD><I>Sam Donaldson, ABC News: </I>
<DD>At both conventions his podium reports provided even-handed observations on what each speaker
hoped to accomplish. In San Diego he refrained from gratuitous attacks on the Republicans for
being too intolerant. In Chicago, on the first day of the convention, Donaldson offered a
balance appraisal of the party delegates, noting that the Democratic delegates "are far to the
left of the mainstream just as the Republicans were to the right of the mainstream." In the
midst of network hoopla over Clinton's acceptance speech, only Donaldson realized that while
Clinton gave a "great speech," the "record shows that the next day he may give a different
speech, change his mind, trim it a little bit, do something else."
<BR>
<DD><I>Lisa Myers, NBC News</I>
<BR>
<DD>One of the few reporters to pose questions from both the left and right. In San Diego, she asked
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from the right about how she "has generally opposed efforts to cut
off benefits to illegal immigrants, particularly education and health benefits. Why would
hardworking American taxpayers pay for people who are here illegally?" Then she asked her about
how people who saw her speech "found it too negative. They didn't particularly like the degree
to which you attacked the President. In retrospect, do you think you went too far?" On the first
night in Chicago Myers quizzed a delegate about whether liberals or New Democrats control the
party. Myers was the only broadcast network reporter to provide details in prime time from the
Star story on Dick Morris.
<BR>
<DD><I>Brian Ross, ABC News</I>
<BR>
<DD>Although CNN's Brooks Jackson appeared early in prime time with stories on corporate
contributions and union influence, ABC's Ross must be highlighted despite the fact his pieces
did not air in prime time. In a series of World News Tonight stories, Ross went after, with
equal vigilance, the big money contributors to both parties. Ross raised issues never mentioned
anywhere else on the networks, such as "the giant media corporations," which are "very much in
the middle of the mix." In San Diego he noted that "Last night, the ABC hospitality was a
lobbyist's dream." In Chicago he looked at one big donor, "His name is Arthur Coia, who despite
being President of a labor union the FBI says has long been controlled by the Mafia...has become
one of the Democrats' top money people."
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="worst">
<DD><FONT  SIZE=+1><B>Worst reporters</B></FONT>
<BR>
<DD><I>Maria Shriver, NBC News</I>
<BR>
<DD>Seemed baffled why a rape victim would have anything to do with Republicans and her interview
with Hillary Clinton following the First Lady's address was more two like old friends sharing
tales of their suffering than a dispassionate interview. Just after rape victim Jan License
addressed Republicans about victim's rights, Shriver asked her: "But why [speak] at a Republican
convention? So many people have said that they don't think this ticket, or perhaps this party,
is supportive of women's issues. Why make this stand here?" Shriver's under the podium interview with the First Lady assumed Mrs. Clinton had been unfairly attacked by Republicans. Shriver
posed questions like "This has been a difficult couple of years for you. Did that applause, the
way you've been treated here, the way people have been reacting to you, kind of make it all go
away?" And, noting GOP criticism of her book, Shriver wondered "How did that affect you when you
heard about that?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Judy Woodruff, CNN</I>
<BR>
<DD>In San Diego she repeatedly demanded that Republicans explain why there weren't more female
delegates, but in Chicago instead of challenging Democrats on their pro-partial birth abortion
stand, she worried about welfare reform going too far and defended Hillary Clinton from
Republican attacks. She peppered Hillary Clinton with six welfare reform questions, all assuming
that it is going too far. By the end she was pleading with Mrs. Clinton to do something:
"Eleanor Roosevelt, whom you admire, mentioned her again just now, said that much of the time
she kept her disagreements with the President to herself in private, but there were times that
she felt it was important to disagree publicly. Does there ever come a time with you, and if not
welfare reform, the what?" 
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw, NBC News</I>
<BR>
<DD>Found Republican speakers threaten to be perceived as too mean, took a pot shot at Ronald
Reagan, and portrayed Republicans as insensitive to rape, but praised the speaking power of
Democrats. In San Diego he warned that the GOP knows "it has to lower the threshold of perceived
meanness on the part of the country. In Chicago, after Jesse Jackson's speech which attacked
conservatives, he admired how his words grew "out of a very deep passion." Brokaw did at least
mention Whitewater in Chicago, but after the moving tribute to Ronald Reagan in San Diego he
took this swipe: "Ronald Reagan will have to learn how history will judge his time in office --
the deficits, the Iran-Contra affair." At the GOP conclave he told a rape victim "this is a
party that is dominated by men," so he wondered, "do you think before tonight they ever thought
about what happens in America with rape?" 
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="networks">
<DD><FONT  SIZE=+1><B>In 1992, the networks questioned the convention's tone</B></FONT>
as too negative 70 times during the GOP convention, to zero at the Democratic convention. This
year, analysts again searched for questioning of negative tone (such as the use of words like
"attack" or "bash"), and found a similar tilt. In San Diego, prime-time network analysts
suggested Republican negativity on 34 occasions, to one NBC reference to Clinton "pummeling"
Dole in TV ads. In Chicago, the network suggested Republican negativity again on 23 occasions,
to only six occasions for the Democrats. In total, a negativity discrepancy of 57 to 7.
<BR>
<B>Republican convention:</B>
<BR>
<DD>On August 13, keynote speaker Rep. Susan Molinari said: "Americans know that Bill Clinton's
promises have the lifespan of a Big Mac on Air Force One." Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison remarked
earlier: "America -- it's time to wake up to President Clinton and his high-taxing,
free-spending, promise-breaking, Social Security-taxing, health care socializing, drug-coddling,
power-grabbing, business-busting, lawsuit-loving, UN-following, FBI-abusing, IRS-increasing,
200-dollar-haircutting, gas-taxing, over-regulating, bureaucracy-trusting, class-baiting,
privacy-violating, values-crushing, truth-dodging, Medicare-forsaking, property-rights-taking,
job-destroying friends."
<BR>
<DD><I>Network Reaction: </I>On NBC, Tim Russert warned: "I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas
is dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be interpreted by some people as mean." On
CBS, Dan Rather announced Hutchison was "expected to hit President Clinton, rhetorically, with
everything short of a tire tube." CBS's Bob Schieffer called her "Attack Dog Hutchison." CNN's
Judy Woodruff announced: "A Clinton-bashing night." 
<BR>
<B>Democratic convention:</B>
<BR>
<DD>Jesse Jackson said: "President Clinton has been our first line of defense against the Newt
Gingrich Contract, America's right-wing assault on our elderly, our students, and our civil
rights." Mario Cuomo charged: "The Republicans are the real threat. They are the real threat to
our women. They are the real threat to our children. They are the real threat to clean air,
clean water, and the rich landscape of America...in the end, Bill Clinton spells hope and the
Republicans spell disaster."
<BR>
<DD>On August 29, Sen. Ted Kennedy used the same literary device that caused Hutchison to be bashed
for negativity, in this case describing the GOP platform: "It is the radical wish list of the

<DD><I>Network Reaction:</I> On Jackson, "The most stirring speech of the convention so far," cooed Dan
Rather. "The old lion has not lost its roar," oozed Tom Brokaw. "Convention rhetoric has not
been much better than it was tonight," exclaimed Ken Bode on CNN. On Cuomo, ABC's Jim Wooten
noted wistfully: "For a quick moment, deja vu...That old-fashioned voice, full-throated, fierce,
raising the rafters worth of Chicago conventions...This was a glimpse of conventions past, when
liberals were still the lions of the party, and rhetoric roared." CNN's Bob Franken asked Andrew Cuomo about his father: "You really are a fan of his speaking style.
It's amazing, isn't it?"
<BR>
<DD>On Kennedy,  Tom Brokaw came out of the speech on NBC/PBS: "Senator Edward M. Kennedy, still in
full voice after all these years in the United States Senate. The proud champion of the liberal
cause, addressing this convention hall once again as he does every four years." On CNN, Ken Bode
observed: "You need a partisan speech, one that puts it to the other party. You get it at any
convention. Ted Kennedy does it as well as anybody could do it. Elder statesman of the party.
Eloquent."

Christians who make up a very large part of this convention. What's the challenge there?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Michel McQueen, 8/12:</I> "Peter, there is no mistaking the passion and the conviction of the
Christian conservative movement to this convention. We told you before that about half of the
delegations are controlled by people who consider themselves to be pro-life and very
conservative...."
<BR>
<DD><I>Michel McQueen to a black delegate, 8/13:</I> "Contrary to the stereotype many people have of
African Americans who are active in politics, Mr. Fobbs is very conservative, he is pro-life, he
is not a life-long Republican, isn't that true?" 
<BR>
<DD><I>Jim Wooten, 8/15:</I> "Bob Dole and Jack Kemp have to identify themselves tonight and they have to
choose whether they're going to be the ticket of the Ralph Reed, religious right, Christian
Coalition Republicans or whether they're going to be the ticket of the more inclusive party
we've seen from the podium this week."
<BR>
<DD><I>Lesley Stahl, 8/12:</I> "You know, TV programmers have an expression: target audience. The target
audience tonight is women, particularly those 30 to 60. The whole purpose of tonight's
convention, the whole program, is to diminish the image of this party as extreme because that's
what's turning the women off. Four years ago, the main speaker at the convention, the Republican
convention, was Pat Buchanan. He was yelling, his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be
Colin Powell, he will appeal for civility. On the platform, women find that extreme, it's
turning them off."
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to U.S. Rep. Susan Molinari, 8/12:</I> "I want to read you a quote, a party official here
said that the role of the prime time speakers, that would include you, is to confuse voters
about the real influence of your party's most conservative wing and the, quote, `Christian
right.' Are you part of that effort?"

<DD><I>Dan Rather to Pat Robertson, 8/13:</I> "True or untrue: that if elected, a President Dole would be
more to the right than candidate Dole."
<BR>
<DD><I>Ed Bradley to two Missouri delegates, 8/13:</I> "We had talked earlier about the fact that polls
show that most of the delegates of this convention are more conservative than Republicans at
large. How do you get that message out to people who are not, perhaps, not as conservative as
you? How do you convince them to support the Republican ticket, the Republican platform?" Lesley
Stahl, 8/14: "We're hearing a lot of grousing about the re-packaging of the party. We've spoken
to delegates in Louisiana, Missouri, other delegations, who are saying, Where are our issues? In
gagging opponents of abortion, affirmative action, those kinds of issues, Bob Dole may be
turning off the very people he needs to leave the convention gung ho. They say putting three,
pro-choice women on last night was too much. But Bob Dole has a dilemma: In order to win, he
does have to change the perception of this party as too extreme. Dan."
<BR>
<DD><I>Ed Bradley to a Buchanan delegate, 8/14:</I> "There's been an effort to paint a moderate face to
this convention. How does this sit with you?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Bob Franken to Gerald Ford, 8/12:</I>  "President Ford do you worry  the Republican Party in the last
couple of years became a more conservative, or at least was pictured as a more conservative
sometimes a party that seemed to be going away from the politics that you stood for?"
<BR>
<DD><I>William Schneider, 8/12:</I> "President Ford mentioned what he called a drift to the right in the
Republican party. He was always known as a moderate Republican from the center of the party. And
he says it's been reversed by this convention. Well, I'm sure he believes that, a lot of people
do. But they wrote a platform that is very much a right wing platform. It was written by a lot
of social conservatives."
<BR>
<DD><I>Gene Randall to an Idaho delegate, 8/13:</I> "Do you feel that the line-up of speakers at this
convention reflects a platform which seems to be much more conservative than the speakers?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Gene Randall to Phyllis Schlafly, 8/13:</I> "With me is Phyllis Schafly, an ardent anti-abortion
rights advocate. Do you think the speakers do not reflect the conservatism of the platform?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Bernard Shaw, 8/13:</I> "Bob Dole did not get the tolerance language he wanted in the abortion plank
which came out of this platform committee earlier in the week. He didn't get a few other things.
The conservatives have iron clad control over this convention."
<BR>
<DD><I>Bob Franken, 8/14:</I> "It's interesting they just had a moment ago a very brief tribute to the
Republican freshmen in the House of Representatives. Why brief? Because they are highly, highly
controversial. It's the freshman of the House of Representatives that really gave Bill Clinton
the extremist issue, fairly or unfairly."
<BR>
<DD><I>David Bloom, 8/12:</I> "There is a sense of pride among these Republicans that he [Colin Powell]
will articulate why he is a Republican. Frankly, there is some trepidation on part of some of
the more conservative delegates. They do not see eye-to-eye with him on their views."
<BR>
<DD><I>Tim Russert, 8/13:</I> "Key word: mean-spirited and extremist. They want to avoid those labels. They
have thus far after two days and that's why you're not going to see Newt Gingrich in prime time
tonight. I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is dangerous, Tom, because she uses
words that could be interpreted by some people as mean."
<BR>
<DD><I>Tim Russert after Dole's speech, 8/15:</I> "These are difficult speeches to give as you know, Tom.
He's appealing to a very conservative audience in the hall here but he's trying to reach
independent voters out in the country."

convention is designed to undo the damage done to the Republican image by you and the Republican
Congress, which fairly or unfairly the voters seem to see as extreme, you've heard all the
words. Do you think that's true and does it make you feel repudiated at all?"

conservative from Senator Lott, but tonight on the NewsHour, Pat Buchanan said most of his views
were consistent, most of Senator Dole's views, were consistent with his own, and he cited
specifically, affirmative action, and the platform position on illegal immigration. And as you
all know, Pat Buchanan is on the farthest extreme of the right wing of the party. How does that
set with you?"

<DD><I>Dan Rather to CBS analyst Kevin Phillips, 8/26:</I> "We said in San Diego, we pointed out, that a
large percentage of the actual delegates on the floor, not people who spoke from the podium,
were members of the quote `religious right.' A very large percentage of these delegates
represent organized labor, but we're not seeing that many union/labor people speak from the
podium itself." Dan Rather to Jesse Jackson, 8/26: "Bill Clinton's been running pretty hard to
the right, so far that some Democrats now call him a `Republicrat.' Do you go that far?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to AFL-CIO leader John Sweeney, 8/29:</I> "Who do you think Bill Clinton is: liberal,
moderate?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to Senator Ted Kennedy, 8/29:</I> "A liberal has been defined as a person too
broad-minded to take his own side in an argument. That's never been a problem for our guest in
the booth now, Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. Thanks for being here. They say Bill
Clinton is the ultimate pragmatist; That he fakes left, runs right, but has really no immovable
core principles of his own. Has that been your experience?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Rather:</I> "You know that Senator Dole, Jack Kemp, House Speaker Gingrich say, to the public, Bill
Clinton's posing as a centrist but as soon as he gets elected he's going to be right in there
with Ted Kennedy and they'll be working the same old liberal agenda. True?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Sam Donaldson, 8/26:</I> "Well first of all they want to accomplish the same thing the Republicans
accomplished -- showing a unified party, even though we know from our survey that these
delegates are far to the left of the mainstream just as the Republican delegates were to the
right of the mainstream...."
<BR>
<DD><I>Jeff Greenfield, 8/26:</I> "What's interesting to me, Peter, is the delegates who clearly are way to
the left even of rank and file Democrats, much less the country, have signed on to a moderate
centrist platform." 
<BR>
<DD><I>Cokie Roberts 8/26:</I> "What the delegates there [Texas, Oklahoma, Virginia delegations] and the
politicians there have been telling me tonight is this convention has got to look very moderate
for their Democrats to win in those states..."
<BR>
<DD><I>Sam Donaldson, 8/26:</I>  " Cuomo and Jackson were supportive of the President, but they preached the
liberal line."
<BR>
<DD><I>Peter Jennings, 8/27:</I> "Well, whether this is orchestrated or not, it's almost as if Democrats
here who share many of Mrs. Clinton's liberal views are saying to the Republicans we like you as
they liked Mrs. Dole."
<BR>
<DD><I>Jeff Greenfield, 8/27:</I> "That's right, which is why I have come to think of her speech as
liberalism lite. This was a speech in the first place aimed at Democrats who do believe in a
much more communal concept of family..."
<BR>
<DD><I>William Schneider, 8/27:</I> "Well I think the word Kennedy or Kennedyism to Democrats means tough
liberals. It's a combination that's become very rare these days."
<BR>
<DD><I>William Schneider on Mario Cuomo's speech, 8/27:	</I> "And he had a unique twist on Clinton's move to
the center. Very controversial among liberal Democrats when he said, the President actually
lifted the albatross from the party so that we could better sell our core Democratic
principles."
<BR>
<DD><I>William Schneider, 8/27:</I> "You know if this night, this day of the convention, the afternoon,
evening, remembered for anything I think it's two things really. One is Jesse Jackson and Mario
Cuomo early in the evening who were making the liberal case for the reelection for Bill
Clinton."
<BR>
<DD><I>David Broder after Cuomo and Jesse Jackson, 8/27:</I> "Well, they've [Democrats] let the country in
on a big secret, there are still liberals in the Democratic party. In fact this convention hall,
delegates, are filled with liberals. And the Congressional Democratic party is still a liberal
party. But most of the message so far has been, `We've changed, we're new, we're different.'
What you heard tonight was a very old fashioned partisan Democratic message."
<BR>
<DD><I>Judy Woodruff to Senator Bob Kerrey, 8/28:	</I> "The Republicans are now saying, `Just wait. If you
think Bill Clinton's been liberal up until now. Just wait. When he's reelected he's gonna feel
free to move to the left and do all those liberal things that he's really wanted to do all
along.' And you're aware of this debate that's going on about whether it's gonna be Bill Clinton
to the center or Bill Clinton to the left. What do you think?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw to Vice President Al Gore, 8/26:</I> "Let me ask you about the state of the Democratic
Party and President Clinton's fortunes particularly. It seems to me that he's doing a lot better
now because the win by the Republicans in 1994 really forced your administration to move much
more swiftly to the center. Is that proposition wrong?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Brokaw, 8/26:</I> "The Vice President was saying no no no, this is not forced on us by the
Republicans, we really always had this kind of thing in mind in the first place. But since 1994
they have slid across the political spectrum to really right of center. And they've got a guy by
the name of Dick Morris who's advising them on a daily basis how to be more pragmatic."
<BR>
<DD><I>David Bloom, 8/27:</I> "Tom, I'm down here with Joe Kennedy, son of Robert Kennedy, a liberal
legacy. When many Americans look to that podium tonight, they'll say that's a liberal First
Lady. What does she need to say, what ought she say tonight?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw to James Carville, 8/29:</I> "Lot of buzz out there about Dick Morris having to leave the
campaign. He was the man who moved him to the right. I know that you had some philosophical
differences with Dick Morris. Does this mean that the door has been opened again for those of
you who believe that the President probably ought to move a little more left of center?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw, 8/29:</I> "Clinton will have something tonight for the more liberal Democrats who are
here and not happy that he signed the welfare reform bill, which they believe is too radical.
He's going to talk about a proposed program to encourage job creation for welfare recipients and
businesses, especially in the inner city."

<BR>
<DD><I>Mark Shields, 8/26:</I> "Bill Clinton has another great advantage that Bob Dole didn't have. Bob
Dole had to deal with the most activist wing of his party, which in this case are the cultural
conservatives. He had to appease them, he had to mollify them, he had to best them at some
times. Bill Clinton, because of the fact as we've discussed in the past, is unchallenged and has
been unchallenged for renomination within his own party, that the party has accepted him as the
standard bearer, for the last 12 months has been able to run for the middle, so there is no
faction of the party that he has to spend any time, effort, or energy this week really
mollifying."

[Hillary] may not change the numbers for her husband, that she either helps or hurts in the
intensity of the feeling. That for instance, liberals like the delegates here feel more
enthusiastic about the President because they know she's really a committed liberal?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw, 8/27:</I> "There will be other speakers tonight as well, some stars from conventions
past; the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Mario Cuomo, two of the, of course, large liberal voices in
this party of diminishing liberal voices, so we have a full night ahead here, Jim."
<BR>
<DD><I>Lisa Myers to Senator John Breaux (D-LA), 8/28:</I> "I'm here with one of the smoothest operators in
the United States Senate. A man who worked very hard to pull President Clinton to the center,
Senator John Breaux of Louisiana. Senator, you said today, that you thought the President went
left in the first two years, not because he is a liberal at heart, but because he wanted the
liberals to like him. Explain what you mean."
<BR>
<DD><I>Gwen Ifill, 8/28:</I> "Barney Frank certainly is an outspoken liberal, one of the last few standing.
And I'm interested in finding out whether pragmatism has replaced true liberalism at this
convention?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Margaret Warner to Clinton/Gore Deputy Manager Ann Lewis, 8/29:</I> "Alright, let's talk briefly
about campaign strategy. As we've heard a million times tonight, Dick Morris was the strategist
that helped Bill Clinton figure out how to move back to the center and so on and it was
controversial as Dee Dee Myers just said, even inside the White House. Do you think that that
course will be maintained, Ann Lewis, with Dick Morris gone?"

family. I'm a little confused. Bob Dole says this is the party of inclusion, but Governor Weld,

<DD><I>Wolf Blitzer to AFL-CIO chief John Sweeney, 8/28:</I> "Many of your members are Republicans. How do
you explain to them that you're using, in effect, their dues to help elect Democrats?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw to former Texas Governor Ann Richards, 8/27:</I> "You paid the price to some degree. You
lost the governership of Texas because this country still is a little bit schizoid, isn't it,
about the role of women in American politics?" 
<BR>
<DD><I>Maria Shriver to Hillary Clinton after her speech, 8/27:</I> "You are credited with really
redefining the role of First Lady and for doing that you've taken a lot of heat, a lot of
criticism. As you look back, do you wish you'd redefined it a little less?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Shriver:</I> "You talked a lot tonight about It Takes A Village, your book. And as you well know,
that was a lightning rod for criticism at the Republican convention. Kay Bailey Hutchison took
off on it, Bob Dole took off on it. How did that affect you when you heard about that?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the Right:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>David Bloom to James Carville about Hillary Clinton's speech, 8/27:</I> "I was struck by the fact
that she talked about health care and the need for more health care insurance for the
unemployed. That's a topic that got her and Bill Clinton into a lot of trouble two years ago.
Why would she revisit that tonight?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Elizabeth Farnsworth to White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, 8/26:</I> "We're looking
tonight at this whole question of who the Democrats are. Did the President turn his back on
fundamental Democratic principles when he signed the welfare bill?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Farnsworth to Ickes:</I> "Does it worry you that the welfare, signing the welfare bill is unraveling
the safety net that took so long to put together?" Tom Brokaw to HHS Secretary Donna Shalala,
8/26: "If you were a poor single mother in a poor rural state in America, without many
resources, and you wanted to go to work, you want to do all the right things, but there aren't
many jobs for people who have real skills, wouldn't you be slightly terrified looking into the
next two years?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Maria Shriver to Georgia Governor Zell Miller, 8/27:</I> "We were just hearing Tim Russert talk
about the platform. A lot of the delegates here don't feel that the platform reflects the
Democratic Party that they joined five, ten years ago. Why are they wrong?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Shriver:</I> "But how concerned are you about the divisions, that people would say tension, this
isn't reflective, the Democratic Party sold out, it's a, it's a Republican Party with a
different name?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Shriver:</I> "But when you get out and you walk this floor of this convention center, do people come
up to you and say, `I am really angry about welfare reform, this is not what the Democratic
Party is about.'"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the right:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Lisa Myers to Senator John Breaux, 8/28:</I> "Doesn't that [Clinton moving to center] reinforce
claims of the President's critics who say that he is a man without many deep convictions, who in
fact is guided by the need to be liked, and by a burning desire to get re-elected?"

<CENTER><h2>Media Research
Center History</h2>
</CENTER>
<P>
<dd>Founded by <a href="/mrc/about/bozelbio.html">L. Brent Bozell III</a> in 1987 with a mission
to bring political balance to the nation's news and entertainment
media, the Media Research Center has become the nation's largest
and most respected conservative media watchdog organization.<BR>

<P>
<dd>With the most sophisticated computerized tape archive
(over 115,000 hours of footage) and database of its kind in the
world, the MRC tracks and analyzes virtually everything in the
national media. Every day teams of MRC analysts input into a custom
designed computerized database everything the leftist press is
saying. And then confront liberals in the press directly with
evidence of their slanted reporting.<BR>

<P>
<dd>The <A HREF="/mrc/news/"><B>News Division</B></A> publishes two newsletters,
<I><B><A HREF="/mrc/mediawatch/">MediaWatch</A></B></I> and <I><B><A HREF="/mrc/nq/">Notable Quotables</A></B></I>,
which document the leftist bias in the news media every month.
At a national press conference on June 5th in Washington, D.C.,
the MRC formally launched <B><A HREF="/mrc/reality/">&quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot;</A></B>a $2.78
million campaign that represents the most ambitious, comprehensive,
and technologically advanced effort ever undertaken to neutralize
the left-wing news media. And the MRC's new book <I><B><A HREF="/mrc/bookstore/">Pattern of
Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency</A></B></I>
is a result of four years of research and analysis.<BR>

<P>
<dd>The <B><A HREF="/mrc/entertainment/">Entertainment Division</A></B> exposes the left-wing
agenda in the entertainment media.  In 1995, it opened
an office -- the <B><A HREF="/mrc/ptc/">Parents Television Council</A></B> (PTC) -- right
in the heart of Hollywood. Its two missions are to bring family
programming back to television and to identify, recruit, and mobilize
the emerging conservative movement in Hollywood. In early February,
the MRC held a bipartisan press conference featuring Senator Joseph
Lieberman (D-CT) and Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX). Seventy-four
lawmakers also signed a letter calling for a return to the <B><A HREF="/mrc/entertainment/famstuff.html">Family
Hour</A></B> which would enable parents and their children to
share in quality programming.<BR>

<P>
<dd><B><A HREF="/mrc/freemarket/">The Free Market Project (FMP)</A></B>
is another division of the MRC and works to educate the media
on what they know so little about -- the free market system. FMP
publishes a monthly newsletter, <I><B><A HREF="/mrc/medianomics/">MediaNomics</A></B></I>, as well as other books, monographs, and <A HREF="/mrc/news/sreport.html"><B> Special Reports </B></A>.
FMP also hosts <B>Quarterly Breakfast Forums</B> which bring together
conservative public policy makers and the media. The goal is to
teach the media to report more accurately conservative positions
on key economic and business issues.<BR>

<P>
<dd>MRC spokesmen challenge reporters with evidence of
liberal bias regularly on television programs like NBC's <I>Today</I>; CNN's <I>Crossfire</I> and <I>Reliable Sources</I>;
CNBC; and NET programs.  MRC research is used by every major national
(and local) conservative talk show host, like Rush Limbaugh, G.
Gordon Liddy, Ollie North, Paul Harvey, Mark Rosen, and dozens
of others.  The MRC produces a nationally-syndicated newspaper column
and articles for the top newspapers in America, including
<I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, the <I>Washington Post</I>, the
<I>Washington Times</I>, the <I>New York Post</I>, the <I>L.A.
Times</I> and many others.<BR>

<P>
<dd>In 1992, the MRC founded the <a href="/mrc/about/internad.html">
<B>Montgomery Internship
Program</B></a>, with the purpose of helping young conservatives in
their pursuit to bring balance to journalism.<BR>

<TITLE>The Real Clinton</TITLE>
<CENTER><img src="/nationalreview/images/real2.gif" ALT="The Real Clinton"></center>
<P>
<hr width=50%>
<P>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
The Real Clinton is more or less the opposite of the Real McCoy. What you see is very definitely not what you get, and indeed it may not be what you see a moment or two later. There is a chameleon quality about the 42nd President of the United States, a quicksilver opportunism, that enables him to don and doff identities like cloaks: the New Democrat who promises to end welfare as we know it, the paleo-liberal who takes on the Klan in defense of black churches, the economic statesman who steers by the bond market, the policy wonk avid to socialize one-seventh of the U.S. economy, the moralist who crusades against illegitimacy, the redneck roue with Astroturf in the back of his pick-up, the nostalgia-merchant who wants teenagers home by seven, the futurist with visions of an information superhighway, and at all times and on all occasions the bringer of empathy who feels the pain of that day's audience, whether millionaires or the poor, feminists or Good Ol' Boys, labor unions or blue-chip managements.
<P>
Underneath all the empathy, however, there is a set of policies and attitudes that gives a sort of consistency to his Administration, and even to his personality. In the following pages, we examine this Real Clinton from several angles. We look at Clintonism, that ambidexterity of campaigning right and governing left; at Clinton's steering of the economy by the stars of focus group and polling data; at the multicultural refashioning of the American identity in which he nervously colludes; at his stumblings down the multilateral by-ways of foreign policy, talking loudly and carrying a small stick; at his high-minded healing and sly exploitation of America's most entrenched problem -- race; at the manifold ways in which he, Hillary, and their confederates hidden in the last agencies of the alphabet, have abused federal power to extend their own personal power; and, finally, at that most extraordinary amphibian, Clinton the Bully Pulpiteer. Tales, in short, to / <I>``harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood</I> / <I>make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres</I> / <I>thy knotted and combined locks to part / and each particular hair to stand an end</I> / <I>like quills upon the fretful porpentine.''</I> Now read on.

I agree with Karen. The real underlying problem is in the fact that the
complete elimination of Israel is the ultimate goal of the Arabs. Making
any concessions in such a situation is very unwise for Israel. Nearly all
parties involved prefer to pretend that the only problem is Israel's
control of some territories in Judea, Samaria and Gaza and that Arab
control of these territories would insure lasting peace. Quite the
opposite is true. In fact Israel gained control over these territories
in the course of war initiated by Arab countries with the purpose of the
total destruction of the Jewish state. So the territories (or their
inhabitants) have nothing to do with the issue (by the way, during two
decades of Jordanian control Palestinians on the west bank of Jordan
were not given any autonomy, moreover their political activities in that
direction were brutally suppressedironically, Israeli security forces
never came even close to that level of brutality against Palestinians). <br>

Ever since 1948 the Moslem nations in the middle east have been
determined to annihilate the Jews in Israel. One way or another this is
still their purpose. The only way that Israel will continue to be able
to exist in such a sea of hostility is to have a big stick ready to
thump anyone trying to harass them. This problem has been faced by
hundreds of nations over the centuries. Let's pray that America
continues to support Israel or else one day we might see another
holocaust. The Moslems should read their own Koran and be at peace with the Jews.<br>

The PM is not going to agree to any terms as long as Arabs are killing Jews. The former PM sold his countrymen down then river; more Jews have been killed during the so-called peace than during the previous ten years in America. We need to stand up for legitimate rightsI'm tired of always placating certain groups. It's time to take charge, which is what Israel and the USA resent.<br>

Most recently, he seems to be drifting away from a hard-line policy, but if
he should resume catering to the extremist in his party alliances, Congress
should start reviewing funds allocation. He will soon continue talking of peace. 
Since the Arabs have little to bargain with, Israel must lead the way in peace negotiations. 
The longer the Palestinians experience peace, the less inclined they will be toward renewed
attacks on Israel.<br>

Mark, who do you think is not on the right track?  Do you think that
Netanyahu is placing any trust in Arafat?  Pulling his troops out of
Palestinian territory demonstrates no trust in Arafat.  Arafat is not to
be trusted and I don't think Netanyahu will make that mistake.  With
regards to U.S. policy towards Israel, Clinton fails  as he has failed
in all foreign policy.  As long as he regards advice from the likes of
Barbara Streisand as sage, or the diplomacy of Jimmy Carter as
indeipensable, then we will have to conclude it is Clinton that is on
the wrong track.  However we will have to dismiss his lousy foreign-
policy record as simply poor judgment until we find out how much
Iranian money contributed to his re-election. Iran has, after all,
had closer ties with the Soviets than Israel ever has, and Clinton has
demonstrated how easily U.S. policy can be bought.  If it weren't for the
Jewish wealth in this country, Clinton would have sold them down the
Jordan river already!<br>

Tend to agree with Ravitch on this one, but we must chart the course  
that preserves American leadership without being everyone's keeper. We  
should pay our fair share where people are willing to work/fight for  
democracy and economic prosperity. We do not need to get involved in the  
side issues that Israel and D'Amato keep pitching in the fire. Curious  
that Ms. Albright suddenly discovers her history in the related fray! <br>

No. It seems as though the lesson will never be learned: surrender to and appeasement of aggression and terrorism only feeds the flames of such deplorable behavior. Why Arafat is seen as one with any control over his "principals," the Palestinians, and would thus be in a position to be taken seriously as a negotiator on their behalf is another question altogether. However, Netanyahu obviously takes a superior approach to negotiation when compared to his predecessors' desire to cede as much as possible for as little as possible in return.<br> 
<I>Mark G. Heiman, heiman@fas.harvard.edu</I>

Netanyahu's unwise attempt to essentially rewrite the agreements reached with Arafat by the previous Israeli government will ultimately redound to the detriment of the Israeli people. Unlike many of my brethren on the right, I am far from sanguine on chances of survival for the nation of Israel, and "in your face" arrogance from the right in Israel has always reminded me of the proverbial whistler walking by the graveyard. Israel relies on technological and tactical superiority to keep the Arabs at bay, as well as the strength of its most important ally, the United States. Parity between Arabs and Israelis in technology and military sophistication is not far off. After this event arrives, as it surely will, how then will the United States keep 140 million Arabs from working their will in their ancestral homeland against a few million Israelis?<br>

It is about time that American policy towards Israel became what its policies towards Italy and Ireland are: friendly interest but no more. We don't anymore get involved with Italian elections; something could be said for having done so in the immediate post-WWII period. We try in Ireland to be relatively even-handed, even though politicians do try to cater to the IRA proclivities of all too many Irish Catholic Americans. I guess Italy is the proper example. Let Israel be like Italy and our government more indifferent to the Zionist lobby. Pat Buchanan got a lot of flack for his perhaps blunt statement about the Zionist Amen Lobby in Washington but he was probably right. Currently such stalwart exemplars of virtue like Senator D'Amato are catering to the NY Jewish vote by browbeating the Swiss about Jewish assets in Swiss bank vaults. Certainly the Swiss will be found somewhat less than sterling in their doings, but D'Amato's demagoguery is obvious in its political purpose. Let's say Good Luck to Netanyahu and the rest of the Israelis. If Israel is so wonderful why are so many Jewish and possible pseudo-Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe preferring to come to the United States?<br>

I never thought I'd say this, but I think Netanyahu is doing a pretty good job. When he was first elected I was convinced his arrogance and zealotry would deliver the Middle East to full-scale warhis election rhetoric was harsh, and he seemed determined to undo the great strives toward peace forged by Prime Ministers Rabin and Peres. But since then he has moderated his approach, and by continuing the peace processdespite the constant fuming of Israel's right winghe is enabling the possibilities of lasting peace in the Middle East and a free Palestine.<br>

Netanyahu does what Clinton is not capable of doing. Leading his country and doing what his strength of character tells him is best for his country. We in the US would do well to see our national security threatened economically and culturally as the Israelis see theirs threatened militarily. Netanyahu defends his country's right to exist as a Jewish state by confrontational force when necessary, rather than the kinder-gentler sympathetic abetting practiced by the Clinton Administration. I would trade a leader like Netanyahu for Clinton, but I'm sure Israel would pass!<br>

<font size=5 color="#2F4F2F">The Individual Investment Account Act</font><br>
<font size=4>(S. 159 and H.R. 328)</font><br>
<hr width=50%>
This important, bipartisan legislation has been sponsored in the 104th Congress<br>
by Senator John Breaux and Representative Jim McCrery.  Briefly, this Act establishes accounts available to all taxpayers that would permit:<br> 
</center>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited tax deductions for all contributions.
<br>
<li>No penalty taxes nor forced distributions at any age.  Taxes are paid solely upon withdrawals.
<br>
<li>No income tax nor estate tax at death.  Beneficiary has benefactor's tax basis. (See Note A)
<br>
<li>Home Purchase/Sale Tax Deferred Rollovers (See Note B)
<br>
<li>Tax-deductible purchase of life insurance, provided the proceeds are added to the tax-deferred account.<br>
</ul>
<p>
Note A: With all withdrawals being taxed at ordinary income tax rates,
there is no rational need for income tax nor estate tax at death.
 The beneficiary can maintain the account and assumes the benefactor's
tax basis, if any.
<br><p>
Note B: Principal Residence Rollovers:<br>
<P>
Home Purchase:  up to $15,000-indexed for inflation-of otherwise
taxable distributions may be rolled over from the account without
tax for first purchase of principal residence.  However, the tax
basis of residence is reduced by like amount.
<br>
<P>
Home Sale:  proceeds from sale of a principal residence may be rolled over
into the investment account without tax.  The tax basis of the account is
thereupon adjusted to reflect the tax basis of former residence, plus the
existing law's $125,000 exemption on the home's sale after age 55.<br>

 1st Session 
 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a deduction for 
 contributions to individual investment accounts, and for other 
 purposes. 
                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
                            January 4, 1995 
 Mr. McCrery introduced the following bill; which was referred to  
     the Committee on Ways and Means 
                                A BILL 
 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a deduction for 
 contributions to individual investment accounts, and for other 
 purposes. 
   Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
 United States of America in Congress assembled, 
 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
   This Act may be cited as the `Individual Investment Account Act  
 of 1993'. 
 SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. 
   (a) In General: Part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the 
 Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to additional itemized 
 deductions for individuals) is amended by redesignating section 220 
 as section 221 and by inserting after section 219 the following new 
 section: 
 `SEC. 220. INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. 
   `(a) Deduction Allowed: In the case of an individual, there shall 
 be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to the aggregate amount 
 paid in cash for the taxable year by such individual to an 
 individual investment account established for the benefit of such 
 individual. 
   `(b) Definitions and Special Rules: For purposes of this section-- 
       `(1) Individual investment account: The term `individual 
     investment account' means a trust created or organized in the 
     United States for the exclusive benefit of an individual, but 
     only if the written governing instrument creating the trust 
     meets the following requirements: 
           `(A) No contribution will be accepted unless it is in cash. 
           `(B) The trustee is a bank (as defined in section 408(n)) 
         or another person who demonstrates to the satisfaction of 
         the Secretary that the manner in which that person will 
         administer the trust will be consistent with the 
         requirements of this section. 
           `(C) No part of the trust assets will be invested in any 
         collectable (as defined in section 408(m)). 
           `(D) The assets of the trust will not be commingled with 
         other property except in a common trust fund or common 
         investment fund. 
       `(2) Time when contributions deemed made: A taxpayer shall be 
     deemed to have made a contribution on the last day of a taxable 
     year if the contribution is made on account of such taxable  
     year and is made not later than the time prescribed by law for 
     filing the return for such taxable year (not including 
     extensions thereof). 
   `(c) Tax Treatment of Distributions:  
       `(1) In general: Except as otherwise provided in this 
     subsection, any amount distributed out of an individual 
     investment account shall be included in gross income by the 
     distributee unless such amount is part of a qualified 1st-time 
     homebuyer distribution. 
       `(2) Qualified 1st-time homebuyer distribution: For purposes 
     of this subsection-- 
           `(A) In general: The term `qualified 1st-time homebuyer 
         distribution' means any payment or distribution received by 
         a 1st-time homebuyer from an individual investment account 
         to the extent such payment or distribution is used by the 
         individual within 60 days to pay qualified acquisition  
         costs with respect to a principal residence for such 
         individual. 
           `(B) Dollar limitation: The aggregate amount which may be 
         treated as qualified 1st-time homebuyer distributions for 
         all taxable years shall not exceed $15,000. 
           `(C) Basis reduction: The basis of any principal  
         residence described in subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by 
         the amount of any qualified 1st-time homebuyer distribution. 
           `(D) Definitions: For purposes of this paragraph-- 
               `(i) Qualified acquisition costs: The term `qualified 
             acquisition costs' means the costs of acquiring, 
             constructing, or reconstructing a residence. Such term 
             includes any usual or reasonable settlement, financing, 
             or other closing costs. 
               `(ii) 1st-time homebuyer: The term `1st-time 
             homebuyer' means any individual if such individual had 
             no present ownership interest in a principal residence 
             during the 3-year period ending on the date of 
             acquisition of the principal residence to which this 
             paragraph applies. 
               `(iii) Principal residence: The term `principal 
             residence' has the same meaning as when used in section 
             1034. 
       `(3) Transfer of account incident to divorce: The transfer of 
     an individual's interest in an individual investment account to 
     his former spouse under a divorce decree or under a written 
     instrument incident to a divorce shall not be considered a 
     taxable transfer made by such individual notwithstanding any 
     other provision of this subtitle, and such interest at the time 
     of the transfer shall be treated as an individual investment 
     account of such spouse and not of such individual. Thereafter 
     such account shall be treated, for purposes of this subtitle,  
     as maintained for the benefit of such spouse. 
   `(d) Tax Treatment of Accounts:  
       `(1) Exemption from tax: An individual investment account 
     shall be exempt from taxation under this subtitle unless such 
     account has ceased to be such an account by reason of paragraph 
     (2). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any such account 
     shall be subject to the taxes imposed by section 511 (relating 
     to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of  
     charitable, etc. organizations). 
       `(2) Loss of exemption of account where individual engages in 
     prohibited transaction: 
           `(A) In general: If, during any taxable year of the 
         individual for whose benefit the individual investment 
         account is established, that individual engages in any 
         transaction prohibited by section 4975 with respect to the 
         account, the account shall cease to be an individual 
         investment account as of the first day of that taxable year. 
           `(B) Account treated as distributing all its assets: In 
         any case in which any account ceases to be an individual 
         investment account by reason of subparagraph (A) on the 
         first day of any taxable year, paragraph (1) of subsection 
         (c) shall be applied as if there were a distribution on  
         such first day in an amount equal to the fair market value 
         (on such first day) of all assets in the account (on such 
         first day). 
       `(3) Effect of pledging account as security: If, during any 
     taxable year, an individual for whose benefit an individual 
     investment account is established uses the account or any 
     portion thereof as security for a loan, the portion so used 
     shall be treated as distributed to that individual. 
       `(4) Rollover contributions: Paragraph (1) shall not apply to 
     any amount paid or distributed out of an individual investment 
     account to the individual for whose benefit the account is 
     maintained if such amount is paid into another individual 
     investment account for the benefit of such individual not later 
     than the 60th day after the day on which he receives the  
     payment or distribution. 
   `(e) Cost-of-Living Adjustment:  
       `(1) In general: In the case of any taxable year beginning in 
     a calendar year after 1992, the dollar amount contained in 
     subsection (c)(2)(B) shall be increased by an amount equal to-- 
           `(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by 
           `(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under 
         section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable 
         year begins. 
       `(2) Rounding: If any dollar amount (as increased under 
     paragraph (1)) is not a multiple of $10, such dollar amount 
     shall be increased to nearest multiple of $10 (or, if such 
     dollar amount is a multiple of $5 and not of $10, such dollar 
     amount shall be increased to next higher multiple of $10). 
   `(f) Custodial Accounts: For purposes of this section, a  
 custodial account shall be treated as a trust if the assets of such 
 account are held by a bank (as defined in section 408(n)) or  
 another person who demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the 
 Secretary, that the manner in which he will administer the account 
 will be consistent with the requirements of this section, and if  
 the custodial account would, except for the fact that it is not a 
 trust, constitute an individual investment account described in 
 subsection (b). For purposes of this title, in the case of a 
 custodial account treated as a trust by reason of the preceding 
 sentence, the custodian of such account shall be treated as the 
 trustee thereof. 
   `(g) Reports: The trustee of an individual investment account 
 shall make such reports regarding such account to the Secretary and 
 to the individual for whose benefit the account is maintained with 
 respect to contributions, distributions, and such other matters as 
 the Secretary may require under regulations. The reports required  
 by this subsection shall be filed at such time and in such manner 
 and furnished to such individuals at such time and in such manner  
 as may be required by those regulations.' 
   (b) Deduction Allowed in Arriving at Adjusted Gross Income: 
 Subsection (a) of section 62 of such Code (defining adjusted gross 
 income) is amended by inserting after paragraph (15) the following 
 new paragraph: 
       `(16) Individual investment account contributions: The 
     deduction allowed by section 220 (relating to individual 
     investment accounts).' 
   (c) Individual Investment Accounts Exempt From Estate Tax: Part 
 III of subchapter A of chapter 11 of such Code is amended by 
 redesignating section 2046 as section 2047 and by inserting after 
 section 2045 the following new section: 
 `SEC. 2046. INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. 
   `Notwithstanding any other provision of law, there shall be 
 excluded from the value of the gross estate of the value of any 
 individual investment account (as defined in section 220(b)). 
 Section 1014 shall not apply to such accounts.' 
   (d) Nonrecognition of Gain on Sale of Principal Residence Where 
 Amount Equal to Otherwise Taxable Gain Deposited Into Individual 
 Investment Account: Part III of subchapter B of chapter 1 of such 
 Code is amended by inserting after section 121 the following new 
 section: 
 `SEC. 121A. EXCLUSION OF GAIN FROM SALE OF PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE IF 
                   REINVESTMENT IN INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNT. 
   `(a) General Rule: Gross income does not include gain from the 
 sale or exchange of property if, during the 5-year period ending on 
 the date of the sale or exchange, such property has been owned and 
 used by the taxpayer as his principal residence for periods 
 aggregating 3 years or more. 
   `(b) Limitation: The amount of gain excluded from gross income 
 under subsection (a) shall not exceed the amount paid in cash 
 (during the 1-year period beginning on the date of the sale or 
 exchange) to an individual investment account (as defined in  
 section 220(b)) established for the benefit of the taxpayer or his 
 spouse. 
   `(c) Certain Rules On Ownership and Use To Apply: Rules similar  
 to the rules of section 121(d) shall apply for purposes of 
 determining ownership and use under this section.' 
   (e) Tax on Prohibited Transactions: Section 4975 of such Code 
 (relating to prohibited transactions) is amended-- 
       (1) by adding at the end of subsection (c) the following new 
     paragraph: 
       `(4) Special rule for individual investment accounts: An 
     individual for whose benefit an individual investment account  
     is established shall be exempt from the tax imposed by this 
     section with respect to any transaction concerning such account 
     (which would otherwise be taxable under this section) if, with 
     respect to such transaction, the account ceases to be an 
     individual investment account by reason of the application of 
     section 220(d)(2)(A) to such account.'; and 
       (2) by inserting `or an individual investment account 
     described in section 220(b)' in subsection (e)(1) after

     regarding an individual investment account at the time and in 
     the manner required by such section shall pay a penalty of $50 
     for each failure unless it is shown that such failure is due to 
     reasonable cause.'

 Account: Subsection (a) of section 1016 of such Code is amended by 
 striking `and' at the end of paragraph (24), by striking the period

SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. 
  (a) In General: Part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to additional itemized 
deductions for individuals) is amended by redesignating section 220 
as section 221 and by inserting after section 219 the following new 
section: 
`SEC. 220. INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. 
  `(a) Deduction Allowed: In the case of an individual, there shall 
be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to the aggregate amount 
paid in cash for the taxable year by such individual to an 
individual investment account established for the benefit of such 
individual. 
  `(b) Definitions and Special Rules: For purposes of this section-- 
      `(1) Individual investment account: The term `individual 
    investment account' means a trust created or organized in the 
    United States for the exclusive benefit of an individual, but 
    only if the written governing instrument creating the trust 
    meets the following requirements: 
          `(A) No contribution will be accepted unless it is in cash. 
          `(B) The trustee is a bank (as defined in section 408(n)) 
        or another person who demonstrates to the satisfaction of 
        the Secretary that the manner in which that person will 
        administer the trust will be consistent with the 
        requirements of this section. 
          `(C) No part of the trust assets will be invested in any 
        collectible (as defined in section 408(m)). 
          `(D) The assets of the trust will not be commingled with 
        other property except in a common trust fund or common 
        investment fund. 
      `(2) Time when contributions deemed made: A taxpayer shall be 
    deemed to have made a contribution on the last day of a taxable 
    year if the contribution is made on account of such taxable  
    year and is made not later than the time prescribed by law for 
    filing the return for such taxable year (not including 
    extensions thereof). 
  `(c) Tax Treatment of Distributions:  
      `(1) In general: Except as otherwise provided in this 
    subsection, any amount distributed out of an individual 
    investment account shall be included in gross income by the 
    distributee unless such amount is part of a qualified 1st-time 
    homebuyer distribution. 
      `(2) Qualified 1st-time homebuyer distribution: For purposes 
    of this subsection-- 
          `(A) In general: The term `qualified 1st-time homebuyer 
        distribution' means any payment or distribution received by 
        a 1st-time homebuyer from an individual investment account 
        to the extent such payment or distribution is used by the 
        individual within 60 days to pay qualified acquisition  
        costs with respect to a principal residence for such 
        individual. 
          `(B) Dollar limitation: The aggregate amount which may be 
        treated as qualified 1st-time homebuyer distributions for 
        all taxable years shall not exceed $15,000. 
          `(C) Basis reduction: The basis of any principal  
        residence described in subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by 
        the amount of any qualified 1st-time homebuyer distribution. 
          `(D) Definitions: For purposes of this paragraph-- 
              `(i) Qualified acquisition costs: The term `qualified 
            acquisition costs' means the costs of acquiring, 
            constructing, or reconstructing a residence. Such term 
            includes any usual or reasonable settlement, financing, 
            or other closing costs. 
              `(ii) 1st-time homebuyer: The term `1st-time 
            homebuyer' means any individual if such individual had 
            no present ownership interest in a principal residence 
            during the 3-year period ending on the date of 
            acquisition of the principal residence to which this 
            paragraph applies. 
              `(iii) Principal residence: The term `principal 
            residence' has the same meaning as when used in section 
            1034. 
      `(3) Transfer of account incident to divorce: The transfer of 
    an individual's interest in an individual investment account to 
    his former spouse under a divorce decree or under a written 
    instrument incident to a divorce shall not be considered a 
    taxable transfer made by such individual notwithstanding any 
    other provision of this subtitle, and such interest at the time 
    of the transfer shall be treated as an individual investment 
    account of such spouse and not of such individual. Thereafter 
    such account shall be treated, for purposes of this subtitle,  
    as maintained for the benefit of such spouse. 
  `(d) Tax Treatment of Accounts:  
      `(1) Exemption from tax: An individual investment account 
    shall be exempt from taxation under this subtitle unless such 
    account has ceased to be such an account by reason of paragraph 
    (2). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any such account 
    shall be subject to the taxes imposed by section 511 (relating 
    to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of  
    charitable, etc. organizations). 
      `(2) Loss of exemption of account where individual engages in 
    prohibited transaction: 
          `(A) In general: If, during any taxable year of the 
        individual for whose benefit the individual investment 
        account is established, that individual engages in any 
        transaction prohibited by section 4975 with respect to the 
        account, the account shall cease to be an individual 
        investment account as of the first day of that taxable year. 
          `(B) Account treated as distributing all its assets: In 
        any case in which any account ceases to be an individual 
        investment account by reason of subparagraph (A) on the 
        first day of any taxable year, paragraph (1) of subsection 
        (c) shall be applied as if there were a distribution on  
        such first day in an amount equal to the fair market value 
        (on such first day) of all assets in the account (on such 
        first day). 
      `(3) Effect of pledging account as security: If, during any 
    taxable year, an individual for whose benefit an individual 
    investment account is established uses the account or any 
    portion thereof as security for a loan, the portion so used 
    shall be treated as distributed to that individual. 
      `(4) Rollover contributions: Paragraph (1) shall not apply to 
    any amount paid or distributed out of an individual investment 
    account to the individual for whose benefit the account is 
    maintained if such amount is paid into another individual 
    investment account for the benefit of such individual not later 
    than the 60th day after the day on which he receives the  
    payment or distribution. 
  `(e) Cost-of-Living Adjustment:  
      `(1) In general: In the case of any taxable year beginning in 
    a calendar year after 1994, the dollar amount contained in 
    subsection (c)(2)(B) shall be increased by an amount equal to-- 
          `(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by 
          `(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under 
        section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable 
        year begins, by substituting `1994' for `1989' in 
        subparagraph (B) thereof. 
      `(2) Rounding: If any dollar amount (as increased under 
    paragraph (1)) is not a multiple of $10, such dollar amount 
    shall be increased to nearest multiple of $10 (or, if such 
    dollar amount is a multiple of $5 and not of $10, such dollar 
    amount shall be increased to next higher multiple of $10). 
  `(f) Custodial Accounts: For purposes of this section, a  
custodial account shall be treated as a trust if the assets of such 
account are held by a bank (as defined in section 408(n)) or  
another person who demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the 
Secretary, that the manner in which he will administer the account 
will be consistent with the requirements of this section, and if  
the custodial account would, except for the fact that it is not a 
trust, constitute an individual investment account described in 
subsection (b). For purposes of this title, in the case of a 
custodial account treated as a trust by reason of the preceding 
sentence, the custodian of such account shall be treated as the 
trustee thereof. 
  `(g) Reports: The trustee of an individual investment account 
shall make such reports regarding such account to the Secretary and 
to the individual for whose benefit the account is maintained with 
respect to contributions, distributions, and such other matters as 
the Secretary may require under regulations. The reports required  
by this subsection shall be filed at such time and in such manner 
and furnished to such individuals at such time and in such manner  
as may be required by those regulations.' 
  (b) Deduction Allowed in Arriving at Adjusted Gross Income: 
Subsection (a) of section 62 of such Code (defining adjusted gross 
income) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new 
paragraph: 
      `(14) Individual investment account contributions: The 
    deduction allowed by section 220 (relating to individual 
    investment accounts).' 
  (c) Individual Investment Accounts Exempt From Estate Tax: Part 
III of subchapter A of chapter 11 of such Code is amended by 
redesignating section 2046 as section 2047 and by inserting after

`SEC. 2046. INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. 
  `Notwithstanding any other provision of law, there shall be 
excluded from the value of the gross estate of the value of any 
individual investment account (as defined in section 220(b)). 
Section 1014 shall not apply to such accounts.' 
  (d) Nonrecognition of Gain on Sale of Principal Residence Where 
Amount Equal to Otherwise Taxable Gain Deposited Into Individual 
Investment Account: Part III of subchapter B of chapter 1 of such 
Code is amended by inserting after section 121 the following new

sale or exchange of property if, during the 5-year period ending on 
the date of the sale or exchange, such property has been owned and 
used by the taxpayer as his principal residence for periods 
aggregating 3 years or more. 
  `(b) Limitation: The amount of gain excluded from gross income 
under subsection (a) shall not exceed the amount paid in cash 
(during the 1-year period beginning on the date of the sale or 
exchange) to an individual investment account (as defined in  
section 220(b)) established for the benefit of the taxpayer or his 
spouse. 
  `(c) Certain Rules On Ownership and Use To Apply: Rules similar  
to the rules of section 121(d) shall apply for purposes of 
determining ownership and use under this section.'

    individual for whose benefit an individual investment account  
    is established shall be exempt from the tax imposed by this 
    section with respect to any transaction concerning such account 
    (which would otherwise be taxable under this section) if, with 
    respect to such transaction, the account ceases to be an 
    individual investment account by reason of the application of 
    section 220(d)(2)(A) to such account.'; and 
      (2) by inserting `or an individual investment account 
    described in section 220(b)' in subsection (e)(1) after

<P>
Dear Colleague:
<P>
I have re-introduced the Individual Investment Account Act-H.R.
328 in the 104th Congress-to make long overdue improvements to
our tax law to boost personal savings.
<P>
This legislation provides for unlimited tax deductions for IRA-type
savings, tax-deferred earnings growth, no penalty tax, no forced
distribution at any age, and no income tax or estate tax at death.
 Ordinary income taxes are paid solely when withdrawals take place
from the Investment Account into the first purchase of a principal
residence and the tax-free roll-over into the Investment Account
of the proceeds from the sale of a principal residence.
<P>
As we all know, personal savings is far too low for our nation's
economy to achieve robust economic growth and increased national
wealth.  A major impeding factor is the senseless &quot;double
tax&quot; on savings imposed by the ordinary income tax.  Under
the &quot;double tax,&quot; personal income is first taxed when
earned.  Then, if the resulting post-tax disposable income is
used for consumption of goods and services, no further federal
income taxes are imposed.  If the income is saved, the earnings
that accrue to the savings are taxed again.  Thus, the cost of
saving is higher than the cost of consumption-a policy which needlessly
restricts both savings and growth.
<P>
I believe the differential in the tax treatment of savings vs.
consumption can best be resolved by creating a universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible, IRA-type plan as provided in H.R. 328.  This bill
removes the income tax's recognized bias against saving.  I urge
you to read the article on this plan written by syndicated columnist
Donald Lambro and provided on the back of this Dear Colleague.
 (H.R. 3179 of the 103rd Congress is identical to H.R. 328.)
<P>
If you are interested in encouraging savings and promoting economic
growth, please call Heather Hanson of my staff (x52777) to join
me as a cosponsor of H.R. 328.
<P>
Sincerely,<p>

<title>Letter from John Breaux</title>

<br>Washington, DC 20510-1803</center>
<p>
<center>March 24, 1995</center><p>
<p>
<p>
<pre>
Dear Colleague: <p>

As you well know, we in Congress have been deeply concerned about the very
low level of saving within the United States.  As a result, there have
been many bills introduced in this 104th Congress to increase personal
saving.  A number of Senators have cosponsored more than one. 

<p>

In addressing this vital need to increase household saving, and the
related tax revenue impact arising therefrom, it is important to recognize
a position that is widely accepted by economists:  the ordinary income tax
is biased against savings and favors consumption.  Thus, the only
remaining questions are:  how bad is the bias; how can we correct it; is
the government's tax revenue impacted; and what are the economic losses or
gains from change? 

<p>

This letter applies to a bill I have sponsored, S. 159.  This legislation
is unique in a number of ways, Most importantly, S. 159 totally removes
the income tax bias against personal saving in a simple, sound way.  My
legislation would permit unlimited tax deductible contributions to
Individual Investment Accounts (IIAs) by all taxpayers. 

<p>

Please review the enclosed summary of S. 159 and article by the Institute
for Research on the Economics of Taxation (IRET) which describes S. 159 as
&quot;...one of the boldest, most imaginative, and most constructive
pro-growth tax initiatives in many years.&quot; 

<p>

I hope that you will join me in this effort by cosponsoring S. 159. 
Please contact Geoff Culbertson (4-4623) for any additional information. 

                                      Sincerely, 


                                      JOHN BREAUX

<P>
&quot;The right to pursue personal liberty, opportunity and economic prosperity is the promise of America.  To create new jobs and increase the standard of living for all, we must relieve the punitive tax burden on productive Americans who invest in their fellow men.  Tragically, the existing U.S. tax code penalizes this investment and thereby forestalls economic growth.<br> 
<p>
The Individual Investment Account (IIA) Act corrects this serious flaw - attacks code which has increasingly robbed America of greater GDP growth, new jobs, increased living standards, and even government tax receipts.<br>
<p>
Succinctly, IIAs allow unlimited, fully tax-deductible contributions to IRA-type accounts.  All investment activity is tax free until withdrawn by the saver or beneficiary, thereby eliminating redundant taxation on the same capital.  With IIAs, there are no penalty taxes, no forced distributions, nor estate taxes.<br>
<p>
This common sense bipartisan legislation is the springboard to an American economic renaissance.  All members of Congress, and their constituents, should actively urge its enactment.&quot;<br>

<P>
&quot;America's small business is the powerful economic engine that innovates, creates jobs and spurs economic growth.  The vital fuel for this engine is capital.  Capital is derived from the accumulated and ongoing savings and investments of people.  In fact, there is no other source.<br>
<p>
The existing income tax as applied to personal saving and investing is severely biased against saving and investing.  The effect of this nonsensical bias compounds over time thereby progressively curtailing all economic growth -- and particularly so the job creating growth of small businesses and entrepreneurs.<br>
<p>
The Individual Investment Account Act simply and effectively strips away this tax bias against saving and investing.  IIAs are IRA-type plans that allow each person to contribute unlimited, fully tax-deductible amounts.  Investment activity accumulates tax free until withdrawn by the owner or the beneficiary.  There are no penalty taxes, or forced distributions, nor estate taxes upon death.<br>
<p>
The SBSC urges all voters and their respective members of Congress to actively support this extremely important remedial legislation.&quot;<br>

<P>
&quot;I looked through the proposed savings plan of Senator Breaux and Representative McCrery<br>
[S. 159 &amp; H.R. 328] and agree with its content entirely.<br>
<P>
No country can grow and prosper without a healthy savings rate.  There is a very simple way to raise savings and investment in America.  It is to remove the tax bias against savings by allowing taxpayers unlimited annual contributions to IRA-type plans.<br>
<p>
Several reputable studies have shown conclusively that IRAs in their current form increase personal savings. Removing the caps and expanding the eligibility for tax deductible saving could double America's savings rate overnight.&quot;<br>

&quot;The ACCF supports IRA-type plans such as those in this Act as a way of encouraging the savings necessary for increased investment.  High levels of investment, particularly in productive equipment, is a key element in increasing U.S. economic growth.  S. 159 and H.R. 328, which provide an unlimited tax deduction for saving and eliminate penalty taxes and forced distributions, could make a significant contribution to our economic future.&quot;<br>

<P>
&quot;As has long been recognized, the United States suffers from a low level of new capital formation which in turn has depressed economic growth.  This lack of capital formation is mainly a result of the U.S. tax code being far more biased against productive saving and investment than our foreign competitors face in their tax laws.  Senator John Breaux and Representative Jim McCrery propose to eliminate much of this tax bias [via the] Individual Investment Account Act, which would establish universal, unlimited, tax deductible IRA-type plans.<br>
<p>
Those members of Congress who are truly committed to reigniting economic growth in America, creating millions of productive new jobs, and reducing poverty and increasing economic opportunity and prosperity, will support this needed legislation.<br>
<p>
There will be those who say it will favor the rich, but they will ignore the fact that a rich man can only benefit from the legislation by productively investing his money and refraining from consumption.  As a result, this investment will create jobs for poor men.<br>
<p>
There will be those who say this legislation will add to the federal deficit.  Such an argument ignores the reality that the federal deficit is in large part a result of too little economic growth, and of increased demand for government support by people without jobs or economic opportunity.  Expanding IRA-type plans over the long run will reduce the federal deficit by increasing jobs, total wage payments, and payroll taxes, and diminishing the need for government payments as a result of expanded economic opportunity.&quot;<br>

Why It's So Hard To Save<br>
<p>
</font>
<b>By Edwin Feulner<br></b>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As any economist can tell you, when you subsidize something, you get more of it.  Give welfare checks to people who don't work, for example, and the number of people who don't work increases.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The flip side is equally clear: if you tax something, you get less of it.  For example, a few years back the government slapped a &quot;luxury&quot; tax on cabin cruisers and yachts costing more than $100,000.  The result: Boat buyers decided not to buy new boats, and several U.S. boat builders went belly up -- throwing their workers into the unemployment line.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which brings me to the point: Just as taxes on new boats kill demand for new boats, taxes on savings lead Americans to save less.  Go ahead, try to squirrel away a few dollars for a rainy day (or a sunny day in Florida or Arizona when you retire).  The government will thwart you at every turn, taxing your savings more heavily than just about anything else in the economy.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Think about it: Assume you take $1,000 and put it in a certificate of deposit earning 5 percent.  After one year, you've earned $50.  Now, you already paid steep federal income taxes on that original $1,000 (between 15 percent and 39 percent) when you earned it.  But that's not enough.  The government taxes your modest $50 gain too, leaving only $30.50 in your pocket if you're in the highest tax bracket.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Welcome to the tax code: You're taxed when you work for your money, and you're taxed again when your money works for you.  It's one of the worst features of our tax system, taxing people twice on money they're trying to save.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
About the only way to get some relief from this double tax burden is through Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA's), which let you sock away a few dollars and have the money earn interest tax-free.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But IRAs have their limits, the worst being that the government only lets you contribute $2,000 per year.  The government also slaps you with a steep penalty if you withdraw the money before Uncle Sam says you can (currently age 59-and-a-half), so forget about using the money to buy a home or cope with a financial emergency.  And don't think you can pass the money in your IRA on to your children without going another few rounds with the tax man.  The government forces you to start withdrawing the money at age 70-and-a-half so it can collect income taxes again.  Then when you die, the money falls prey to estate taxes and, when your children finally receive what's leftover, inheritance taxes.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Alas, that's Washington: It takes a good idea like saving money -- which provides the capital to grow the economy and create jobs -- and piles on so many regulations, penalties, and layers of taxation that saving hardly becomes worth the effort.  If there's so little reward for thriftiness, why not spend, spend, spend?
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There's a better way.  A proposal by Tom Kelly, president of the Savers &amp; Investors League of Villanova, Pa., would eliminate the red tape and double taxation that makes saving so hard.  IRAs?  In Kelly's view, they're at best a good start.  He proposes Individual Investment Accounts, a more muscular savings tool that would let you deposit as much of your money as you want tax free (no $2,000 limit), withdraw it for any purpose (hello new house), withdraw it at any age (early retirement anyone?), and let you pass it on to your children with no inheritance or estate taxes (sorry Uncle Sam, my kids come first).
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's not a hard concept to grasp: If you want people to save more, you have to tax their savings less.  So no more preaching from politicians about our low national savings rate until they do for savers what they've already done for yacht buyers.

<BLOCKQUOTE>GOP candidate Bob Dole's tax plan has put tax policy squarely at the forefront of the presidential debate this year, but as far as Tom Kelly is concerned, the plan doesn't go far enough.  Kelly, the ebullient founder and president of the Savers and Investor League (SIL), says that &quot;it is a step in the right direction,&quot; but complains that it &quot;doesn't touch the entire question of taxing savings.&quot;<BR>
<P>
&quot;Reducing the income tax on investment return by 15% is certainly an improvement, but is far short of the proper tax reduction of 100%,&quot; says Kelly.  After you have had your wage or salary income taxed once, he observes, &quot;whatever you have left can only be spent or saved.&quot;  If you save it, he argues, the government will continually tax it, penalizing and discouraging savings.  The result, he maintains, is that &quot;the American people are being ripped off.  People ask, 'Why aren't young people saving?'  Well, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure that one out.&quot;<BR>
<P>
According to Kelly, &quot;All of your savings and investments should be tax deductible and tax deferred.&quot;  Accumulating wealth in the form of either savings or investments, Kelly says, &quot;is the only way to become self-sufficient.  Penalizing savings takes away our self-sufficiency.&quot;<BR>
<P>
The Savers and Investors League lobbies Congress to change the antisavings bias of the tax code, while its affiliated Savers &amp; Investors Foundation carries out research on the impact of taxes on the American economy, taxpayers and government.  The mission of SIL, says Kelly, is to &quot;educate and motivate grassroots voters/taxpayers to challenge and change the way our government measures the tax revenue impact of tax-deferred savings.&quot;<BR>
<P>
A self-described &quot;entrepreneurial businessman,&quot; Kelly founded SIL in 1988 after a run-in with government destroyed his investment business.  &quot;This is not my vocation.  It's a labor of love, believe me.  I refuse to accept the notion that our government and our people can let this happen.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Kelly had been in business 15 years selling policyowner self-directed variable annuities when the IRS and Treasury Department obtained a court ruling overturning 70 previous rulings favorable to firms such as Kelly's and shut it down.  Kelly sued, and the U.S. District Court agreed with him, stating that the Treasury and IRS rulings were in fact arbitrary, capricious, illegal, and unreasonable and that the IRS had usurped the power of Congress.<BR>
<P>
In response to an IRS-Treasury petition, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled, as technical matter and not on the substance of the suit, that the District Court did not have jurisdiction and overturned its decision.  Kelly hired Robert Bork, then a Yale Law School professor, to assist with his appeal to the Supreme Court, but, without stating its reasons, the Supreme Court refused to accept the case.  Thus, the Treasury and IRS won - but not on the merits of their tax law position - and Kelly was forced to liquidate his business in 1978.<BR>
<P>
This experience prompted Kelly to become an activist and after studying up on the matter, Kelly &quot;concluded that the way our nation taxes savings is absolutely, flat-out stupid.&quot;  The current mode of taxing, he argues, &quot;not only kills the accumulated capital and savings of individuals and collectively, our nation, it also kills the tax base of our government, and the government collects less taxes than they otherwise would...  Our nation has lost trillions and trillions of dollars of economic growth because of it.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Kelly does not fault legislators, who are not economists, for failing to understand the economics involved, but thinks that once tax policy got off track, precedent and habit kept it there.  He lays partial blame on accounting practices that began with the Budget Act of 1974, which basically assumes that all money somehow belongs to the government and that failure to tax any existing account, such as personal savings, is a government &quot;tax-expenditure.&quot;<BR>
<P>
As a result, says Kelly, government tax policy views allowing individuals to keep and save their own money as a subsidy.  &quotThis is 100% wrong!&quot; he says.<BR>
<P>
Observing that all the other major economic powers largely exempt savings and capital gains from taxation, Kelly sees his efforts beginning to bear fruit here as well.  SIL test mailings have shown tremendous popular support for the idea of tax-deferred savings, Kelly says, and &quot;we have a bill [H.R. 328 and S. 159] introduced, with very good sponsorship in Congress.  It's sponsored by John Breaux [D. - La.] in the Senate and Jim McCreary [R. - La.] in the House, and has a lot of support.  Dick Armey [R. - Tex.], who's an economist, is a cosponsor.&quot;<BR>
<P>
&quot;This whole taxation of savings question is right on the front burner,&quot; says Kelly, noting that all major tax proposals now include some form of totally tax-exempt savings, including The USA Tax Act (S. 722) sponsored by Senators Pete Domenici [R. - N.M.] and Sam Nunn [D. - Ga.].  &quot;I believe it's just like the Berlin Wall.  No one thought the Berlin Wall would ever come down, but because it was built on quicksand - poof! - the whole thing imploded, and the wall came down.  The same thing's going to happen with the way our nation taxes savings.&quot;<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>They Might Help But They Aren't Sufficient</FONT><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
Washington, D.C., August 7, 1996 - U.S. savers and investors, individually and collectively, suffer under an oppressive tax system; one that doubles, triples and quadruples the taxes applied to the same investment return or gain.  Whoever labeled investment return or gain as &quot;unearned income&quot; had to have a sinister sense of humor.  Securing a reasonable income from saving and investing is not an easy task, and is one that calls for eternal vigilance.
<P>
Reducing the income tax on investment return by 15% is certainly an improvement but is far short of the proper tax reduction of 100%.  After you have had your wage or salary income taxed, whatever you have left can only be spent or saved.  If you spend it there is no investment income for Uncle Sam to tax year after year thereafter.  If you save it, you are creating economic growth for yourself and everyone else - including the government.  It is this added economic growth, derived solely from increased saving, that creates more jobs, and more production at lower costs, and higher standards of living for everyone - including the saver.  All of this expanded economic activity also creates more tax dollars for Uncle Sam than otherwise collected under the annual income tax as applied to saving.
<P>
You don't have to be a rocket scientist to accept the fact that eliminating the tax on saving will increase our peoples rate of saving significantly.
<P>
Is it any wonder all economists recognize the existing inherent tax bias against saving.  A 15% reduction in that bias against investment income is only a small step in the right direction.

<i>The Right Tax Plan For Dole</i></font><br>
By VICTOR A. CANTO<br>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>
Less than a month before the Republican Convention, Bob Dole has yet to present a tax-cut plan.  Why?  Most likely because he hasn't seen one he likes.  The answer may be an unlimited, front-loaded individual retirement account.
<p>
Everyone expects a Republican candidate to set down a tax-cut plan.  And, aside from naming a running mate, a tax cut is Dole's best chance for a fresh, strong appeal to the voters.  But he needs a plan that makes economic sense, wins support within his party and in the country at large and also fits with the Dole we all know.
<p>
The right IRA reforms fill that bill.  They would open a new opportunity for all Americans to save, boosting our national rates of saving and investing, and thus economic growth.  The plan would promote economic efficiency by taxing each economic transaction only once and by end-running the job-killing capital gains tax.
<p>
Early in the campaign, Dole commissioned a group headed by Jack Kemp to draw up a tax plan for the future.  Kemp landed on a refined version of the Hall-Rabushka flat tax.  Dole balked at that, though he has supported a flatter tax structure over the years.
<p>
Kemp then threw his support to Steve Forbes, who based his surprisingly successful campaign on the flat tax.  But when Forbes left the race, so too did the flat tax.
<p>
An unlimited, front-loaded IRA plan can reap some of the benefits of a flat tax - but has stronger political &quot;wings.&quot  It would increase our nation's savings rate and also free up cash trapped in slow-performing investments.
<p>
Current law limits each of us to a maximum IRA contribution of $2,000 a year.  Income taxes don't apply to the money paid into the fund, but do to the money withdrawn from it.
<p>
The $2,000 limit is an arbitrary figure.  Raising it - increasing the chance for tax-deferred investment - would likely boost our national savings rate, which many analysts say is too low.  Removing the limit altogether should boost the savings rate considerably.
<p>
But IRAs are limited for a reason: the fear that, given the chance, too many people would defer too many taxes for too many years.  The loss of tax revenues, though temporary, would seem to increase the federal budget deficit.
<p>
We can solve that problem by front-loading the IRA - by taxing money as it goes into the fund, not as it is withdrawn.
<p>
Think of the tax on IRAs as a sales tax - a tax that is levied when people spend money, rather than when they earn it.  A tax imposed at the end of the time of possession is said to be &quot;back-loaded.&quot;
<p>
A front-loaded tax, by contrast, resembles an income tax, levied when people earn money.  The tax is levied as money is placed into the account, not when it is removed.
<p>
The two taxes generate equivalent amounts of revenue for the government - but the timing of the actual tax receipts is quite different.  Front-loading generates revenue sooner, back-loading later.
<p>
Either way, the program delivers the same amount to the saver at retirement.
<p>
The government could generate extra tax revenues by adding one more twist: allowing all current IRA holders to convert their accounts to the new program.  this would generate a one-time revenue windfall.
<p>
The unlimited, front-loaded IRA indirectly addresses another issue dear to Republican hearts; the capital gains tax.
<p>
The plan adheres to the single taxation philosophy.  Under it, all income earned on the IRA would be tax-free.  The sale of assets in the account would also be tax-free, provided the proceeds are reinvested in the IRA.
<p>
The unlimited IRA is a way to prospectively unlock capital gains and allow for a more efficient resource allocation.  And the &quot;front-loading&quot; feature avoids the need to index gains for inflation, because gains within the retirement account would be liquidated without additional taxes.
<p>
In short, the unlimited, front-loaded IRA provides a way to defuse the capital gains issue, while delivering most of the benefits of single taxation and indexation.
<p>
In is also a way to help each American save for his or her own retirement - a cause Bob Dole can support with real enthusiasm.

<TITLE> Is a Balanced Budget the Key... </TITLE>

<font size=6>Is a Balanced Budget the Key to<br>
Our Economic Future?<br>
</font>
<b>by CHARLES I. PLOSSER</b>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
I am probably not much different from most of you when I say that I listened - first with interest, then with laughter, and finally with complete dismay - to the verbal sparring among supposedly bright and able politicians during the recent budget debates.
<p>
<ul>
<li> Why must we be subjected to all the nonsensical and misleading posturing intended to gain support in the overnight opinion surveys by pitting one interest group against another?
<p>
<li> Why does the Secretary of the Treasury incite the fear of default on U.S. debt obligations when he knows fully well that there is no immediate threat?
<p>
<li> Why should members of Congress take the ludicrous stand that the budget must be balanced in seven years - not six, eight, or none, but seven and only seven years?
</ul>
...

If you could cut through all of the political grandstanding and use of the media to pander to specific interest groups, you would find, of course, claims that important philosophical issues are at stake.  These issues involve fundamental questions over the role and size of government and the structure of the tax system.  Indeed, that is where the real issues lie.
<p>
Unfortunately, these important questions are unlikely to be resolved or to dramatically change the way government affects the allocation of resources during the current Congress.  The very nature  of the legislative process, which entails compromise and a strong preference for the status quo, makes progress difficult and slow.  Instead, the Congress, Administration and policy gurus have, as a practical matter, chosen to make the budget deficit the focal point for the debate.
<p>
...
<p>
Attempting to reduce the deficit, of course, leads to a debate over the nature of the spending reductions and/or tax changes required to accomplish this goal.  The real danger of making deficit reduction the yardstick by which we measure the success of the budget process is that we may succeed in reducing the deficit, but not in resolving the more fundamental problems.
<p>
...
<p>
If I asked a group of Americans why they thought the budget deficit was a problem, I would get a variety of different answers.  But I think a common thread in their answers would be a concern over the health of our economy and the fear that our current high standard of living is likely to be at the expense of not just our own future, but that of our children and generations to come.
<p>
This is a real and justifiable concern.  But the fact is that even if we eliminate the budget deficit - however good that may make us feel - we will not necessarily deal a decisive blow to these more deeply rooted concerns.  In fact, eliminating the deficit is not even the most important step that the government can take towards addressing these concerns.  Much more important than the magnitude of the deficit - and whether it goes to zero in seven years, ten years or at all - is where and how the government spends the resources it takes from us and the nature of the incentives created by the way those revenues are raised.
<p>
If we wish to ensure the health and well-being of our future and that of our children, then we must increase the amount of savings and productive investments we undertake today so that we achieve continued growth of our standard of living.   Slow growth in domestic investment means slower growth in the amount of capital per worker.  This means slower growth in labor productivity and slower growth in real wages.  Make no mistake about it, growth is the key.  The difference between an economy that grows at 2 percent a year and one that grows at 3 percent a year becomes enormous due to compounding.  After 30 years the economy growing at 2 percent is about 80 percent wealthier while the economy growing at 3 percent is almost 150 percent wealthier.
<p>
I am troubled that too many people, in and out of government, are under the misguided impression that, as soon as we balance the budget, we can start congratulating ourselves for saving the nation from economic calamity and moral degradation.
<p>
You have no doubt heard or read that Americans don't save enough.  Among the major developed countries of the world, the U.S. has one of the lowest rates of gross saving.  For example, gross national saving as a percentage of GDP is 33 percent in Japan, 29 percent in Switzerland, 20 percent in Germany, 19 percent in France and only about 14 percent in the U.S.  This relatively low rate of saving means that any investment in productive capacity that exceeds our domestic savings must be supplied by foreigners.  Low domestic saving is the primary cause of our trade deficit - not the fact that some foreign markets are more closed to U.S. goods than we would like.
<p>
If we think of savings as the resource we choose to set aside for investment, then the investment rate represents that portion of output actually invested.  Here again, the U.S. has one of the lowest investment rates among the major industrial countries.  For example, gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of GPD is 31 percent in Japan, 23 percent in Germany, 21 percent in France, but only about 15 percent in the U.S.
<p>
...
<p>
...if we are not careful about how we shrink the deficit we could easily do so in a way that could actually make our low savings and investment patterns worse.  By increasing the tax on savings and investment and directing more government spending toward consumption or to entitlements for individuals with high rates of consumption, we could reduce the deficit but would actually further reduce the motivation to save and invest for the future.
<p>
As a matter of fact, our budget deficit is simply not that big relative to other countries, even countries that have substantially higher savings and investment rates.
<p>
...
<p>
If the deficit is the wrong focus for the debate, how should we think about addressing the real concerns about our economic future?  There are, of course, many factors that influence our individual decisions to save and invest.  It is important that Congress and the American people debate the impact of government spending decisions and tax policies, not simply in terms of their impact on the budget deficit, but in terms of their impact on investment and saving, and thus our ability to grow and enhance our standard of living.
<p>
Under the current patterns of spending and taxation, our government systematically biases individuals away from saving and investing and towards consumption.  This bias in the way the government spends our tax dollars and the way it raises those dollars is a significant contribution to the lower savings patterns that exist here relative to other industrialized nations.
<p>
...
<p>
Our current system which relies heavily on the income tax, is a system that taxes income that we use for consumer purchases only once, but taxes income that we save two and sometimes three times.  For example, under the income tax, wages, salaries, dividends, interest and capital gains are all taxed as personal income.  If we spend that money on a new car, there is no further income tax liability on the car or on the return or value we get from driving the car.
<p>
On the other hard, if we take those same after-tax dollars and save them or invest them in a business, then the return or the value received for those savings is taxed first at the level of the business and is then taxed again when the business distributes the profits back to the investors in the form of dividends or capital gains.  This system penalizes saving and investing and thus encourages consumption.  Since interest on debt is tax deductible to the business, this system also favors debt over equity as a means of financing business expansion.
<p>
For these reasons, economists have long argued in favor of some sort of consumption tax that would not have the same disincentives to save.  Under a consumption tax all savings would be exempt from tax until they were used to consume goods and services.  This approach is in sharp contrast to the current income tax, which penalizes future consumption by taxing it more heavily.
<p>
...
<p>
In the past, there has never been a strong political constituency for tax reform.  After all, as George Bernard Shaw once said, &quot;A government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always count on the support of Paul.&quot;  In this case, we are denying the benefits of our investments to future generations who, to my knowledge, have not yet found a lobbyist to represent their interests and thus seem to be easy prey for the government looking for someone to tax.
<p>
There is now an increasing awareness that fundamental tax reform is important if we are to come to grips with our low savings and under-investment problems.  We are coming to realize that deficit reduction alone is likely to result in a bitterly disappointing change in our savings patterns.
<p>
...
<p>
...we can rest assured that every group that believes they have a vested interest in specific provisions of the current tax code will argue strongly for preserving the status quo.  Who we won't hear from are those whose wages and living standards will be raised by the increase in capital a less distortionary tax code would promote.  These individuals are not nearly so organized - some of them haven't even been born.
<p>
We must come to grips with the concern that we are not investing enough to ensure real growth in capital and labor productivity that will enhance real wages and living standards in the future.  Additionally, we must also tackle the fundamental issue of tax reform.  If we reduce the deficit without reducing the double and triple taxation on savings and investment, we will have failed.  If the 1996 Presidential campaign does not make tax reform a defining issue, we will miss the greatest opportunity for fundamental tax reform since the 16th Amendment, which created the income tax 82 years ago.
<p>
There is little doubt in my mind that in the short run, the prospects for the economy are good.  The long run opportunities, however, are more troublesome.  We must move beyond the simple-minded and misguided forces on a balanced budget and come to grips with the underlying weakness in our savings and investment patterns that threatens the standard of living of our children.  The current debates in Washington have opened a small crack in the door of the entrenched interests of the bureaucracy that invites a serious discussion of these fundamental concerns.  Combine this with the fact that 1996 is a presidential election year and we have perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make fundamental tax reform a major political issue.  The political risks will be high, but so could the economic rewards to the nation.  It should make for a very interesting 1996.

The Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation (IRET) is a 
non-profit, non-partisan, tax exempt 501(c)(3) public policy research 
organization devoted to informing the public about economic policies, 
especially those concerning the federal tax system, that will contribute 
to economic growth, efficiency and competitiveness.  To this end, IRET 
provides policy makers in the private as well as the public sector with 
objective, closely-reasoned analyses of the economic effects of public 
economic policy initiatives.<br>
<p>
Constructive public policies, in IRET's view, are those that reduce 
government interference in the operation of the private, free market 
system.  Such policies must recognize two basic facts of American 
economic life - one, that individuals' decisions about personal effort, 
saving, investment, and consumption, as reflected in voluntary and free 
exchange in the market place, provide the signals for efficient conduct 
of business, and two, that business is the prime mover on which the 
nation's economic progress depends.<br>

<H1>Time To Terminate Tax Bias Against Saving<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I><B>... a tax deduction for income that is saved ... can be incorporated in a complete overhaul of the income tax [or] adopted as a stand-alone measure that would accomplish a large part of the tax restructuring agenda, but without some of the complications of a full-scale rewriting of the tax code.</CENTER> </B></I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<P>
Tax time has rolled around again, and the income tax bias against saving continues to depress economic growth, wages, and personal income.  In January, the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform called for elimination of the income tax bias against saving.  The commission's report reviewed several generic approaches to providing neutral tax treatment for saving and investment.  One approach is to allow a tax deduction for income that is saved, deferring tax on that income until it is withdrawn at a later date for consumption.  Such an approach can be incorporated in a complete overhaul of the income tax.  Alternatively, it can be adopted as a stand-alone measure that would accomplish a large part of the tax restructuring agenda, but without some of the complications of a full-scale rewriting of the tax code.<br>
<p>
Such a stand-alone measure has already been introduced in the Congress by Senator John Breaux (D-LA) as S. 159, and by Representative Jim McCrery (R-LA) as H.R. 328.  Their bills, based on a proposal by the Savers &amp; Investors League, would permit unlimited tax deductible contributions to individual investment accounts (IIAs) by all taxpayers.<br>
<p>
The Nunn-Domenici tax reform proposal, the Armey flat tax bill, and the American Dream Savings Accounts in the GOP House Contract With America would also reduce the bias against saving to various degrees.  The Nunn-Domenici and Armey reforms are likely to require extended debate before any chance of passage.  The American Dream Savings Accounts would eliminate some of the existing penalties on saving, but only for limited uses.  The Individual Investment Account proposal, on the other hand, is a clean, stand-alone measure that would itself by a major income tax reform.<br>
<P>
Renewed interest in the Congress in reducing the tax bias against
saving is all the more important since enactment of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93). OBRA93 increased
the tax bias against saving by raising individual and corporate
marginal income tax rates, permanently extending phase-outs of
itemized deductions and personal exemptions, tightening rules
limiting contributions to private pension arrangements, and limiting
capital gains treatment of several types of financial transactions.
These provisions are bound to retard private sector saving, capital
formation, and economic growth.
<P>
The Breaux and McCreary bills, similar to the unlimited savings
deduction legislation introduced in the 102nd Congress by Representatives
Dick Schulze (R-PA) and Ed Jenkins (D-GA), continues the campaign for one of
the boldest, most imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth
tax initiatives in many years. The bill would permit taxpayers
to defer taxes on saving without restrictions as to the amount of
saving or time of withdrawal. The bill would all but eliminate
the individual income tax bias against personal saving. It would contribute
to higher levels of saving, investment, productivity, and income
than now exist.
<P>
IIAs would have these features:
<UL>
<LI>Unlimited tax deduction of amounts saved.
<LI>Tax-free investment growth until withdrawal.
<LI>No penalty tax on withdrawal at any age.
<LI>No forced distribution at any age.
<LI>No income tax at death. Heirs may maintain the IIA with the
benefactor's cost basis.
<LI>No estate tax on IIA assets.
<LI>Rollover of up to $15,000 (indexed for inflation) from an
IIA into the first purchase of a principal residence (with an
equal reduction in the tax basis of the house).
<LI>Tax-free rollover into the IIA of the proceeds from the sale
of a principal residence.
<LI>In addition to currently-allowed IRA vehicles, tax deductible
premiums for life insurance if proceeds are payable into an IIA.
</UL>

<P>
IIAs, unlike IRAs, would not be limited to retirement saving.
IRAs have been justified as an incentive for taxpayers to save
for retirement. This is too narrow a focus. IRAs should be thought
of as a very limited means of offsetting the current bias in the
income tax against saving.
<P>
Income is taxed when earned. If the income is used for consumption,
there is no further federal income tax imposed (though there may
be small sales or excise taxes). However, if the income
is saved, the earnings of the saving are taxed repeatedly (and,
if later used for consumption, may also face excise or sales taxes).
The income tax thus raises the cost of saving compared to that
of current consumption.
<P>
A neutral tax code would not penalize saving relative to consumption.
There are two ways to make the taxation of saving and consumption
neutral. Either income that is saved should be exempt from tax
(as in traditional IRAs, 401(k) plans, etc.) and the earnings
of the saving and the principal taxed upon withdrawal, or the
amounts saved should be taxed when earned but the earnings should
be tax exempt (as with tax free securities or the &quot;back-ended&quot;
type of IRA offered in the Bentsen-Roth bill in the 102nd Congress).
<P>
The bias in the income tax extends to all taxable saving, not
just that for retirement. To create a neutral tax
system, all saving, whether for retirement, buying a house, college
tuition, a new car, or protection against a rainy
day, should receive the same treatment as in a tax-deferred income
plan.
<P>
IRAs, as currently constituted, have several short-comings. There
are limits on the amounts that can be deducted. Consequently,
IRAs give no added incentive to save to those who are already
doing long-term saving in amounts above the limits. Amounts withdrawn
from an IRA before age 59-1/2 are subject to a penalty in addition
to tax. This makes IRAs unattractive to lower income savers who
cannot afford to save separately for emergencies, to buy a home,
to pay tuition and other near-term goals, as well as a more distant
retirement. There is a mandatory age (70-1/2) for beginning to
withdraw from IRAs to force commencement of recapture of the tax
deferral.
<p>
All saving contributes
to capital formation, productivity, and national income, regardless
of the motive behind it. There is no economic reason for the government
to discriminate against or discourage any type of saving.  In addition, paying for the projected costs of providing for the retirement of the baby boom and generation Xers will only be possible if private saving is increased substantially and soon.
<P>
The IIA proposal avoids all these pitfalls. IIAs will
generate a greater incentive to save among upper-income savers,
be of far greater safety and appeal to lower-income savers, and
encourage more saving by the elderly and their heirs than current
IRAs.
<P>
Some might object that the near-term cost to the Treasury would
make unlimited IIAs too expensive for the federal budget. This
fear if groundless for several reasons.
<P>
First, when the contribution to an IIA constitutes new saving
that would not have been done in the absence of the incentive,
there would be no loss to the Treasury over the lifetime of the
IIA. The tax on the contribution would be deferred, not lost.  The contribution would grow with interest, and
the tax on the compounded principal would equal in present value
the tax foregone when the contribution was made. There would be
no loss of tax, relative to current law, from letting the interest
accumulate tax-free, because the saving would not otherwise have
been done, and there would have been no interest to tax without
the IIA treatment.
<P>
Second, insofar as a portion of the saving would have been done
in the absence of the IIA treatment, the deferred tax on the compounded
contribution would be recouped with interest. The annual taxation
of the interest would be foregone, but would be more than offset
as that portion of the IIA which constituted new saving added
to the GNP and raised revenues from other taxes on the added income.
<P>
For the most part, then, the present value of the taxes collected
by the Treasury would not be reduced, only altered in its timing
as a result of IIA treatment of saving.
<p>
 Might the delay in collection
of the tax and greater near-term government borrowing decrease national saving and an increase in &quot;crowding
out&quot; of private borrowing?  In practice, the answer is &quot;No.&quot; The amount of added
government borrowing would equal the IIA contribution times the
taxpayer's marginal tax rate - 15%, 28%, 31%, 36%, etc. If the
fraction of new saving in each IIA contribution equaled the tax
rate, e.g., if $28 of a $100 contribution were new saving by a
middle income contributor, then that saving 
would equal the added borrowing by the government, and national
saving would not fall. The leading researchers into the effect
of traditional IRAs on saving behavior have concluded that some
60% to 80% of IRA saving was new saving by contributors, well
above the minimum needed to produce &quot;crowding in&quot; of
added saving, not crowding out. Similar results would be expected
from IIAs.
<P>
Because IIA saving would in large part be new saving, IIAs would
add to the amount of investment and growth of the economy, and
would raise productivity, employment, wages, and profits. The
added income would be subject to tax. When the higher corporate
and personal income taxes and the added payroll taxes are factored
in, IIAs are seen to be clear revenue raisers for the government
over time.<BR>

The merits of reducing the income tax bias against saving have
become more urgent in light of the work of The Bipartisan Commission
on Entitlement and Tax Reform.  The Commission projects that unless
current policies are changed exploding entitlement spending to
pay for the retirement and health care of the baby boom and subsequent
generations will produce budget deficits that will preempt all
projected private saving early in the next century with devastating
economic consequences.  Increasing private saving now is an urgent
necessity to avoid this outcome.
<P>
Legislation based on a proposal by the Savers &amp; Investors
League would permit unlimited tax deductible contributions to
individual investment accounts (IIAs) by all taxpayers.  Identical
bills embodying this proposal, called the Individual Investment
Account Act, have been reintroduced in the Senate and the House
in the 104th Congress by members of both parties:  by Senator
John  Breaux (D-LA) as S. 159, and by Representative Jim McCrery

All saving contributes to capital formation, productivity, and
national income, regardless of the motive behind it.  There is
no economic reason for the government to discriminate against
or discourage any type of saving.  In addition, paying for the
projected costs of providing for the retirement of the baby boom
and generation Xers will only be possible if private saving is
increased substantially and soon.
<P>
The IIA proposal avoids all these pitfalls.  IIAs will generate
a greater incentive to save among upper-income savers, be of far
greater safety and appeal to lower-income savers, and encourage
more saving by the elderly and their heirs than current IRAs.
<P>
Some might object that the near-term cost to the Treasury would
make unlimited IIAs too expensive for the federal budget.  This
fear is groundless for several reasons.
<P>
First, when the contribution to an IIA constitutes new saving
that would not have been done in the absence of the incentive,
there would be no loss to the Treasury over the lifetime of the
IIA.  The tax on the contribution would be deferred, not lost.
 The contribution would grow with interest, and the tax on the
compounded principal would equal in present value the tax foregone
when the contribution was made.  There would be no loss of tax,
relative to current law, from letting the interest accumulate
tax-free, because the saving would not otherwise have been done,
and there would have been no interest to tax without the IIA treatment.
<P>
Second, insofar as a portion of the saving would have been done
in the absence of the IIA treatment, the deferred tax on the compounded
contribution would be recouped with interest.  The annual taxation
of the interest would be foregone, but would be more than offset
as that portion of the IIA which constituted new saving added
to the GNP and raised revenues from other taxes on the added income.
<P>
For the most part, then, the present value of the taxes collected
by the Treasury would not be reduced, only altered in its timing
as a result of IIA treatment of saving.  
<P>
Might the delay in collection of the tax and greater near-term
government borrowing result in a decrease in national saving and
an increase in &quot;crowding out&quot; of private borrowing?
<P>
In practice, the answer is &quot;No.&quot;  The amount of added
government borrowing would equal the IIA contribution times the
taxpayer's marginal tax rate &#190; 15%, 28%, 31%, 36%, etc. 
If the fraction of new saving in each IIA contribution equaled
the tax rate, e.g., if $28 of a $100 contribution were new saving
by a middle income contributor, then that saving would equal the
added borrowing by the government, and national saving would not
fall.  The leading researchers into the effect of traditional
IRAs on saving behavior have concluded that some 60% to 80% of
IRA saving was new saving by contributors, well above the minimum
needed to produce &quot;crowding in&quot; of added saving, not
crowding out.  Similar results would be expected from IIAs.
<P>
Because IIA saving would in large part be new saving, IIAs would
add to the amount of investment and growth of the economy, and
would raise productivity, employment, wages, and profits.  The
added income would be subject to tax.  When the higher corporate
and personal income taxes and the added payroll taxes are factored
in, IIAs are seen to be clear revenue raisers for the government
over time.

<P>
The merits of reducing the income tax bias against saving seem
to be gaining bipartisan attention in Washington. Legislation
based on a proposal by the Savers &amp; Investors League would
permit unlimited tax deductible contributions to individual investment
accounts (IIAs) by all taxpayers. Identical bills embodying this
proposal, called the Individual Investment Account Act, have been
introduced in the Senate and the House by members of both parties:
by Senator John Breaux (D-LA) as S. 929, and by Representative
Jim McCrery (R-LA) as H.R. 3179.
<P>
Deferral of tax on any income that is saved is also a key feature
of the Nunn-Domenici tax reform proposal presented on Oct. 5.
The Nunn-Domenici proposal contains additional, major changes
in the income tax to reduce excessive taxation of saving and investment,
but offsets the perceived static revenue loss with higher taxes
on labor. The Nunn-Domenici reform is likely to require extended
debate before any chance of passage. The Individual Investment
Account proposal, on the other hand, is a clean, stand-alone measure
that would itself be a major income tax reform.
<P>
Renewed interest in the Congress in reducing the tax bias against
saving is all the more important since enactment of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93). OBRA93 greatly increased
the tax bias against saving by raising individual and corporate
marginal income tax rates, permanently extending phase-outs of
itemized deductions and personal exemptions, tightening rules
limiting contributions to private pension arrangements, and limiting
capital gains treatment of several types of financial transactions.
These provisions are bound to retard private sector saving, capital
formation, and economic growth.
<P>
The Breaux and McCreary bills, similar to the unlimited savings
deduction legislation introduced in the last Congress by Representatives
Dick Schulze and Ed Jenkins, continues the campaign for one of
the boldest, most imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth
tax initiatives in many years. The bill would permit taxpayers
to defer taxes on saving without restrictions as to amount of
saving or time of withdrawal. The bill would all but eliminate
the income tax bias against individual saving. It would contribute
to higher levels of saving, investment, productivity, and income
than now exist.
<P>
The IIAs would have the following features:
<UL>
<LI>Unlimited tax deduction of amounts saved.
<LI>Tax-free investment growth until withdrawal.
<LI>No penalty tax on withdrawal at any age.
<LI>No forced distribution at any age.
<LI>No income tax at death. Heirs may maintain the IIA with the
benefactor's cost basis.
<LI>No estate tax - IIA assets would be excluded from the gross
estate.
<LI>Rollover of up to $15,000 (indexed for inflation) from an
IIA into the first purchase of a principal residence (with an
equal reduction in the tax basis of the house).
<LI>Tax-free rollover into the IIA of the proceeds from the sale
of a principal residence.
<LI>In addition to currently-allowed IRA vehicles, tax deductible
premiums for life insurance if proceeds are payable into an IIA.
</UL>

<P>
IIAs, unlike IRAs, would not be limited to retirement saving.
IRAs have been justified as an incentive for taxpayers to save
for retirement. This is too narrow a focus. IRAs should be thought
of as a very limited means of offsetting the current bias in the
income tax against saving.
<P>
Income is taxed when earned. If the income is used for consumption,
there is no further federal income tax imposed (though there may
be a small sales or excise tax to be paid). However, if the income
is saved, the earnings of the saving are taxed repeatedly (and,
if later used for consumption, may also face excise or sales taxes).
The income tax thus raises the cost of saving compared to that
of current consumption.
<P>
A neutral tax code would not penalize saving relative to consumption.
There are two ways to make the taxation of saving and consumption
neutral. Either income that is saved should be exempt from tax
(as in traditional IRAs, 401(k) plans, etc.) and the earnings
of the saving and the principal taxed upon withdrawal, or the
amounts saved should be taxed when earned but the earnings should
be tax exempt (as with tax free securities or the &quot;back-ended&quot;
type of IRA offered in the Bentsen-Roth bill in the 102nd Congress).
<P>
The bias in the income tax extends to all taxable saving, not
just that for retirement. Consequently, to create a neutral tax
system., all saving, whether for retirement, buying a house, college
tuition, a new car, a vacation, or protection against a rainy
day, should receive the same treatment as in a tax-deferred income
plan.
<P>
IRAs, as currently constituted, have several short-comings. There
are limits on the amounts that can be deducted. Consequently,
IRAs give no added incentive to save to those who are already
doing long-term saving in amounts above the limits. Amounts withdrawn
from an IRA before age 59-1/2 are subject to a penalty in addition
to tax. This makes IRAs unattractive to lower income savers who
cannot afford to save separately for emergencies, buying a home,
paying tuition and other near-term goals, as well as a more distant
retirement. There is a mandatory age (70-1/2) for beginning to
withdraw from IRAs to force commencement of recapture of the tax
deferral, yet the saving done by the elderly is as economically
valuable as saving done by the young. Indeed, all saving contributes
to capital formation, productivity, and national income, regardless
of the motive behind it. There is no economic reason for the government
to discriminate against or discourage any type of saving.
<P>
The Breaux and McCrery bills avoid all these pitfalls. IIAs will
generate a greater incentive to save among upper-income savers,
be of far greater safety and appeal to lower-income savers, and
encourage more saving by the elderly and their heirs than current
IRAs.
<P>
Some might object that the near-term cost to the Treasury would
make unlimited IIAs too expensive for the federal budget. This
fear if groundless for several reasons.
<P>
First, when the contribution to an IIA constitutes new saving
that would not have been done in the absence of the incentive,
there would be no loss to the Treasury over the lifetime of the
IIA. The tax on the contribution would grow with interest, and
the tax on the compounded principal would equal in present value
the tax foregone when the contribution was made. There would be
no loss of tax, relative to current law, from letting the interest
accumulate tax-free, because the saving would not otherwise have
been done, and there would have been no interest to tax without
the IIA treatment.
<P>

in the absence of the IIA treatment, the deferred tax on the compounded
contribution would be recouped with interest. The annual taxation
of the interest would be foregone, but would be more than offset
as that portion of the IIA which constituted new saving added
to the GNP and raised revenues from other taxes on the added income.
<P>

of the tax and greater near-term government borrowing result in

<FONT SIZE=5>Tips on Writing a Member of Congress</FONT><BR>
<HR WIDTH=75% ALIGN=center>
</CENTER>
<P>
Senators and Representatives pay attention to their mail.  It is good politics.  Responding to mail is crucial to reelection.  A member knows your vote can be won or lost by his/her response.  The most effective letter is a personal one, not a form letter.  It should be concise, informed, and polite.  Some specific tips:<br>
<P>
1.  Try to stick to one typewritten page.  Two pages at most.  Don't write on the back of a page.  If writing longhand, take care to write legibly.<br>
<p>
2.  In a short first paragraph, state your purpose.  Stick with one subject or issue.  Support your position with the rest of the letter.<br>
<p>
3.  If a bill is the subject, cite it by name and number.<br>
<p>
4.  Be factual and support your position with information about how legislation is likely to affect you and others.  Avoid emotional philosophical arguments.<br>
<p>
5.  If you believe legislation is wrong and should be opposed, say so, indicate the likely adverse effects, and suggest a better approach.<br>
<p>
6.  Ask for the legislator's views but do not demand support.  Remember, Senators and Representatives respond to a variety of views, and even if your position is not supported on one issue or bill, it may be the next time.<br>
<p>
7.  Be sure your name and return address are included and legible.<br>
<p>
8.  The suggested address style is:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
The Honorable ________________<br>
United States Senate<br>
______________ Senate Office Building<br>
Washington, D.C. 20510<br>
<p>
Dear Senator ________________,<br>

<center>Constituent Clout...The Power of the Pen...</center><br>
</font><hr>
<p>
During a recent symposium on various tax matters to be considered by Congress, an opinion was expressed by a participant that &quot;there's a certain hopelessness about trying to write a letter to Members of Congress and expecting action.&quot;<br>
<p>
Another symposium participant with extensive lobbying experience on the Hill responded as follows as recorded by a court reporter:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>&quot;Let me tell you something:  10 letters, 20 letters to a House Member from his District is a wake up call like you can't believe.  Fifteen telephone calls on one issue in a given two-day period is a wake up call like you can't believe.<br>
<p>
What is very sad about this country is that they---a lot of folks, not everyone---have no clue of the influence they have on their Members of Congress either in the House or the Senate.  Let me tell you, if they sit down and write a letter or they pick up the phone and call that guy, they have a person there who takes count of the calls and what the subject is.  And, that's given to the Member every day, even if he doesn't---does not speak to the Member.<br>
<p>
And all the lobbyists in the world could call in 20 times a day---and I hate to say this in front of my superiors here, but I don't have the influence that 10 people out there calling in from his District who votes in his District will have on that Member.  And that's a definite wake-up call.  All they have to do is pick up the phone.  All they have to do is write a letter.&quot;<br>
<p>
</blockquote>
This commentary is absolutely correct.  You, and your fellow voter/taxpayers within your Congressional District have enormous clout.  Far too often this latent power lies dormant!<br>

Constituent Clout...You Have Political Power!</font></center><br>
<hr>
<p>
Early in 1996, the Sunday New York Times Magazine presented an excellent article that touched on political action.  One paragraph read as follows:<br>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The N.R.A. doesn't have demonstrations.  They write letters.  In fact, direct action, as a political tactic, is second-choice.  The first choice is to exercise political power, to scare them into voting the right way.  Direct action is what you do when you have no power.  Blacks in the South had to use direct action until they got a voting rights act.  Another problem is, we listen to the critics who say, 'Oh, these politicians don't want to listen to the voters, all they do is listen to campaign contributions.'  In fact, votes will beat money any day.  Any politician forced to choose between his campaign contributors and strong public sentiment is going to vote public sentiment.  Campaign contributions are fungible, you can get new ones.  You can't get new voters.&quot;<br>
<p>
</blockquote>
We, individually and collectively, must exercise our right of protest.  The Savers &amp; Investors League is trying to do its part.  You have political power! Your active participation is vital!<br>

<p>
Welcome.<BR>
<P>
The Savers &amp; Investors League has developed and installed this Web site to help individuals across the country better understand a most serious problem: the irrational taxation of saving and investing.
<P>
Savers and investors do not fare well when it comes to tax legislation.  Not only is the existing income tax severely and improperly biased against saving and investing, savers and investors, as a group, have little political muscle within Congress or Administrations.  This must change.
<P>
There are many excellent organizations and associations that support the needs and desires of savers and investors, such as mutual fund, banking, stock broker, and insurance associations.  However, when priorities are paramount, as is so evident when legislation is formulated, the vital business interests of trade associations, not savers and investors, predominate. 
<P>
Savers and investors are found in all walks of life, in every geographic location, and their interests are fully compatible with the interests of labor; one can't exist and prosper without the other.  It is increasingly being realized that the tax-efficient accumulation of capital is vital to the interests of <EM>all</EM> segments of our society, whether it be labor, capital, or government.  The government produces nothing on its own; its basic sustenance  is from the taxation of capital and labor. When government needlessly and improperly impedes the economic growth of capital, it increasingly impedes the economic growth of labor.  Concurrently, the government  curtails its own tax base.
<P>
The Savers &amp; Investors League is aggressively fighting to remove the government's existing improper and self-defeating tax bias against saving and investing.  The League's activities have political strength directly related to its grass-roots membership within each Congressional District.  Members of Congress do pay attention to the expressed interests of their constituents.  You can easily recognize that each vote counts.  Thus, the League urges and warrants your enthusiastic and active support.  Only by the collective, focused, and sustained action of voter/taxpayers will corrective legislation become law.  The sound taxation of saving and investing will increase jobs and increase our peoples' standard of living.
<P>
 We invite you to explore our Web site.  Read about the actual legislation pending in Congress that could dramatically change the way our Nation taxes your savings and investments.  Review related articles and research reports that support the need for sound, concise tax laws.  Join us as our newest member by filling out and sending in our <A HREF="/savers/member.html">Membership Form</A>. 

We hope the information provided will interest you and prompt you to want to know more and do more about this vital subject.  We stand ready to respond to your enquiries and comments.

<center><b><i>All of your savings and investments should be tax deductible and tax   
deferred<br>  
until you, or your beneficiary, consume it.</i></b></center><br>  
<p>  
The Savers &amp; Investors League was organized in 1988 by <a   
href="/savers/library/tkbio.html">Tom Kelly</a> who recognized the compelling,   
critical need for increased personal savings and investment to foster healthy economic growth in the    
United States. <br>   
<p>   
Without question, private savings and investment is the  foundation for increased personal and national     
prosperity.  Whether these savings are in bank accounts, stocks, bonds, CDs, IRAs, insurance, annuities,    
pension funds, mutual funds, etc., they constitute the vital capital base needed and utilized by individuals,    
families, businesses, and government.<BR>   
<p>   
 On a personal level, insufficient savings creates uncertainty for future retirement, as well as uncertainty   
as to the family financial resources of home and health care needs and desires.  A diminished supply of    
private capital on a national scale causes interest rates to rise and economic growth to slow. Also,    
wages,jobs, and standards-of-living suffer.<br><br>   
 Disastrously, the government continues to pass or maintain self-defeating, senseless laws that   
limit and penalize tax-deferred savings plans such as IRA's, 401(k) s and pensions.<BR>   
<p>   
The annual income tax imposed upon investment return and   
realized gain needlessly and scandalously decreases  the country's   
vital capital base year after year. Not only do taxpayers suffer,   
the government's tax base is progressively reduced too.<BR>   
<P>   
The Nation must maximize personal savings and investment,   
so that private capital will grow and expand as quickly, and as   
soundly, as possible.<BR>   
<P>   
The Individual Investment Account, Senate Bill  
 <a href="/savers/legislation/s159.html">S. 159</a> and House Bill  
 <a href="/savers/legislation/hr328.html">H.R. 328</a>, accomplishes   
this simple but vital objective.<br>  
<p>  
The League helped develop this legislation and works diligently to secure its   
enactment.  The bipartisan sponsors are: Senator John Breaux</a>, Democrat,  
 Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Jim McCrery, Republican,  
 House Ways &amp; Means Committee.<br>  
<p>  
This simple, straight-forward legislation creates IRA-type accounts that provide -   
<br>  
<ul>  
<li>Unlimited, tax-deductible contributions for everyone<br><br>  
<li>No penalty taxes on any account withdrawal<br><br>  
<li>No forced distributions at any time<br><br>  
<li>No income tax nor estate tax at death<br><br>  
<li>Account holder, or beneficiary, only pay taxes on account withdrawals<br><br>  
</ul>  
<p>  
The Individual Investment Account Act has been described by leading tax economists   
as <i>&quot;one of the boldest, most imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth   
tax initiatives in many years.&quot;</i>

<TITLE>Tom Kelly Biography</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#2F4F2F" vlink="#3232CD">
<img src="/savers/images/tkellysm.gif"><FONT SIZE=5><B>&#32;Tom Kelly, President 
and Founder</B></FONT> <HR>
<P>
Tom Kelly, League President and Founder, likes to explain that he is not an actuary, accountant, lawyer or economist.  Instead, he describes himself as an &quot;entrepreneurial businessman&quot; within the pension and life insurance areas who has &quot;a 
facility for conceptualizing and implementing new solutions to old problems&quot;.<BR>
<P>
He began his career in 1948 as a pension and employee benefits consultant with Towers, Perrin, Forster, &amp; Crosby.  In 1962, Tom raised capital to underwrite the First Investment Annuity Company (FIAC).  The Investment Annuity, invented by Tom, was a 


policyowner self-directed variable annuity which had never been offered 
by any insurer previously.<BR> <P>
After fifteen years of product and financial success, the Treasury and 
IRS reversed over 70 favorable rulings issued over prior years to FIAC and other insurer emulators.  FIAC sued the Treasury and the IRS for &quot;arbitrary, capricious, and illegal 
acts&quot;.  The D.C. District Court agreed and stated that indeed the 
Treasury and IRS ruling was in fact arbitrary, capricious, illegal, and 
unreasonable.  Furthermore, the court stated that the IRS had usurped the 
power of Congress, and that deference to their 
expertise on this matter was unwarranted.  The Treasury and the IRS appealed.  The Appellate Court didn't look at 

the merits of the case but ruled that the District Court didn't have 
jurisdiction.  The District Court Judge had previously concluded 
that if FIAC couldn't be 
in District Court, FIAC was being denied due process of law - a 
constitutional matter...<BR> <P>
FIAC employed Robert Bork, Esq., then a Yale law professor and outstanding 
constitutional scholar, to assist in a Supreme Court petition.  For 
unspecified reasons, the 
Supreme Court did not accept the case.  Thus, the Treasury and IRS won - 
but not on the merits

 of their tax law position.  FIAC was thereupon forced to liquidate in 
1978.<BR> <P>
It was this encounter with arbitrary, capricious and illegal government 
acts that prompted Tom's strong interest and on-going great concern about 
the misguided 
driving force behind the government's tax policy in regard to saving.<BR>
<P>
That same year, 1978, Tom formed Insurer Central Services (ICS) that 
assists 
insurers enter the specialized field of variable annuities and variable life insurance.<BR>
<P>
The Savers &amp; Investors League was started in 1988 to educate and 
motivate grass roots voter/taxpayers to challenge and change the way our 
government measures the tax revenue impact of tax deferred savings.  
Towards this end, over the 
intervening years, Tom has worked with legislators, economists, and think tanks to develop legislation that meets the proper criteria for the sound taxation of personal saving.<BR>

<P>    
Because the League lobbies Congress on behalf of voter/taxpayers,
 it is a 501(c)(4) non profit corporation.     
Therefore, contributions to the League are not deductible as charitable contributions for Federal income     
tax purposes. However, contributions to the League may be deductible as an ordinary and necessary     
business expense, or an expense incurred in the production of income.<BR>    
<p> The League's affiliated Savers &amp; Investors Foundation carries out research endeavors that     
explore the impact of taxes on our economy, as well as on taxpayers, our government, and our nation. The     
Foundation is a 501(c)(3) research and educational nonprofit organization. 
Contributions to it are tax     deductible.    
<BR>    
<P>    
Neither the League nor the Foundation have a minimum or    
maximum contribution limit. All contributors choose the contribution    
amount most suitable for themselves.<b> While voluntary contributions    
from all sources are vital to the League's and Foundation's work,    
each voter/taxpayer's active participation via on-going communications    
with his or her Senators and Representative, regardless of contribution    
level, is what really counts. </b> Members of Congress respond to    
strong constituent interest. As a result of the League's activities, 
savers and investors become an increasingly powerful, focused force 
before Congress and the Administration.<BR>

<font size=6><b><i>Membership Information</i></b></font></center>
<hr>
<p><br>
The Savers &amp; Investors League is a nonpartisan, nonprofit 
501(c)(4) grass-roots lobbying organization.  Its purpose is to promote 
private saving and 
investment to foster healthy economic growth in the United States.  To
this end, the League develops sound legislative proposals, as well as
circulates information relating to existing and proposed legislation 
which it believes has either a positive or negative effect on saving 
and investing.  It intends to affect such legislation through grass
roots and direct lobbying efforts.<br>
<p>
The League is committed to action-oriented, legislative projects.
Every effort is made to distribute its views and proposals to Congress, 
the Administration, and other policy and opinion leaders nationally and 
locally to ensure that they are widely examined and discussed.  The 
League also disseminates its view via an active media and Internet 
program.<br>
<p>
Every voter/taxpayer (regardless of age or tax bracket) who saves and 
invests has a vital, personal interest in removing the severe income tax 
bias against saving and investing.  As we all know, Congress and the 
Administration pay close attention to public pressure.  Thus, <i>your</i>
 membership is most important because you join with many others to create 
and build the powerful political force so badly needed for success.<br>
<p>
While the Savers &amp; Investors League does not require any kind of annual 
fee to initiate or maintain membership, it does rely on 
voluntary contributions 
from individuals and corporations for its support.<br>
<p>
Because the League lobbies on your behalf, contributions paid to the League 
are not deductible 
as charitable contributions for Federal income tax purposes.  However, 
such contributions may be deductible as an ordinary and necessary 
business expense, or an expense incurred in the production of income to 
the extent permitted by law.<br>

<P>    
<center><b><i>All of your savings and investments should be tax deductible and tax    
deferred<br>   
until you, or your beneficiary, consume it.</i></b></center><br>   
<p>   
The Savers &amp; Investors League was organized in 1988 by <a    
href="/savers/about.html#tkelly">Tom Kelly</a> who recognized the compelling,    
critical need for increased personal savings and investment to foster healthy economic growth in the     
United States. <br>    
<p>    
Without question, private savings and investment is the  foundation for increased personal and national      
prosperity.  Whether these savings are in bank accounts, stocks, bonds, CDs, IRAs, insurance, annuities,     
pension funds, mutual funds, etc., they constitute the vital capital base needed and utilized by individuals,     
families, businesses, and government.<BR>    
<p>    
 On a personal level, insufficient savings creates uncertainty for future retirement, as well as uncertainty    
as to the family financial resources of home and health care needs and desires.  A diminished supply of     
private capital on a national scale causes interest rates to rise and economic growth to slow. Also,     
wages,jobs, and standards-of-living suffer.<br><br>    
 Disastrously, the government continues to pass or maintain self-defeating, senseless laws that    
limit and penalize tax-deferred savings plans such as IRA's, 401(k) s and pensions.<BR>    
<p>    
The annual income tax imposed upon investment return and    
realized gain needlessly and scandalously decreases  the country's    
vital capital base year after year. Not only do taxpayers suffer,    
the government's tax base is progressively reduced too.<BR>    
<P>    
The Nation must maximize personal savings and investment,    
so that private capital will grow and expand as quickly, and as    
soundly, as possible.<BR>    
<P>    
The Individual Investment Account, Senate Bill   
 <a href="/savers/legislation/s159.html">S. 159</a> and House Bill   
 <a href="/savers/legislation/hr328.html">H.R. 328</a>, accomplishes    
this simple but vital objective.<br>   
<p>   
The League helped develop this legislation and works diligently to secure its    
enactment.  The bipartisan sponsors are: Senator John Breaux</a>, Democrat,   
 Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Jim McCrery, Republican,   
 House Ways &amp; Means Committee.<br>   
<p>   
This simple, straight-forward legislation creates IRA-type accounts that provide -    
<br>   
<ul>   
<li>Unlimited, tax-deductible contributions for everyone<br><br>   
<li>No penalty taxes on any account withdrawal<br><br>   
<li>No forced distributions at any time<br><br>   
<li>No income tax nor estate tax at death<br><br>   
<li>Account holder, or beneficiary, only pay taxes on account withdrawals<br><br>   
</ul>   
<p>   
The Individual Investment Account Act has been described by leading tax economists    
as <i>&quot;one of the boldest, most imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth    
tax initiatives in many years.&quot;</i>   
<p>   
<hr>    
 <FONT size=5><b><a name="obj">Objectives</a></b></FONT><BR>    <hr>   
<P>    
<center><b><i>Your wealth is &quot;wealth&quot; no matter how small or large.<br>    
You must protect it from improper, confiscatory, taxes.</i></b></center><br>    
<p>    
The League's primary objective is to remove the government's senseless     
tax bias against private savings and investments. By building a broad base of voter/taxpayer activists,    
spanning all age groups and income     
levels, the League:<BR>     
<p>    
<ul>    
<li> Works toward the development and adoption of clear, concise, tax laws that    
 promote increased private saving and investing.<BR>    
<br>    
<li> Works with members of Congress and the Administration to support     
or defeat legislation which affects the taxation of private savings and     
investments.<BR>    
<br>    
<li> Communicates with voter/taxpayers, as well as with financial     
institutions, employers, unions, and the media.<br>     
<br>    
<li> Builds coalitions with like-minded groups, unions, and associations.<br>    
<BR>    
<li> Tracks and reports upon relevant legislation as it makes its     
way through the congressional maze.<BR>     
<br>    
<li> Informs the media on current savings and investment taxation issues in     
order to generate broad, public appreciation and understanding     
of this vital subject.<BR>    
</ul>    
<p>  
<hr>    
<FONT size=5><b><a name="sands">Structure and  
Support</a></b></FONT><BR>    <hr>   
   
<P>     
Because the League lobbies Congress on behalf of voter/taxpayers, 
 it is a 501(c)(4) non profit corporation.      
Therefore, contributions to the League are not deductible as charitable contributions for Federal income      
tax purposes. However, contributions to the League may be deductible as an ordinary and necessary      
business expense, or an expense incurred in the production of income.<BR>     
<p> The League's affiliated Savers &amp; Investors Foundation carries out research endeavors that      
explore the impact of taxes on our economy, as well as on taxpayers, our government, and our nation. The      
Foundation is a 501(c)(3) research and educational nonprofit organization.  
Contributions to it are tax     deductible.     
<BR>     
<P>     
Neither the League nor the Foundation have a minimum or     
maximum contribution limit. All contributors choose the contribution     
amount most suitable for themselves. <b>While voluntary contributions     
from all sources are vital to the League's and Foundation's work,     
each voter/taxpayer's active participation via on-going communications     
with his or her Senators and Representative, regardless of contribution     
level, is what really counts.</b>  Members of Congress respond to     
strong constituent interest. As a result of the League's activities,  
savers and investors become an increasingly powerful, focused force  
before Congress and the Administration.<BR>

<img src="/savers/images/tkellysm.gif"><FONT SIZE=5><B><a name="tkelly">&#32; Tom 
Kelly</a>, President and Founder</B></FONT> <HR> 
<P> 
Tom Kelly, League President and Founder, likes to explain that he is not an actuary, accountant, lawyer or 
economist.  Instead, he describes himself as an &quot;entrepreneurial businessman&quot; within the pension 
and life insurance areas who has &quot;a  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
facility for conceptualizing and implementing new solutions to old problems&quot;.<BR> 
<P> 
He began his career in 1948 as a pension and employee benefits consultant with Towers, Perrin, Forster, 
&amp; Crosby.  In 1962, Tom raised capital to underwrite the First Investment Annuity Company (FIAC).  
The Investment Annuity, invented by Tom, was a  
 
 
policyowner self-directed variable annuity which had never been offered  
by any insurer previously.<BR> <P> 
After fifteen years of product and financial success, the Treasury and  
IRS reversed over 70 favorable rulings issued over prior years to FIAC and other insurer emulators.  FIAC 
sued the Treasury and the IRS for &quot;arbitrary, capricious, and illegal  
acts&quot;.  The D.C. District Court agreed and stated that indeed the  
Treasury and IRS ruling was in fact arbitrary, capricious, illegal, and  
unreasonable.  Furthermore, the court stated that the IRS had usurped the  
power of Congress, and that deference to their  
expertise on this matter was unwarranted.  The Treasury and the IRS appealed.  The Appellate Court didn't 
look at  
 
the merits of the case but ruled that the District Court didn't have  
jurisdiction.  The District Court Judge had previously concluded  
that if FIAC couldn't be  
in District Court, FIAC was being denied due process of law - a  
constitutional matter...<BR> <P> 
FIAC employed Robert Bork, Esq., then a Yale law professor and outstanding  
constitutional scholar, to assist in a Supreme Court petition.  For  
unspecified reasons, the  
Supreme Court did not accept the case.  Thus, the Treasury and IRS won -  
but not on the merits 
 
 of their tax law position.  FIAC was thereupon forced to liquidate in  
1978.<BR> <P> 
It was this encounter with arbitrary, capricious and illegal government  
acts that prompted Tom's strong interest and on-going great concern about  
the misguided  
driving force behind the government's tax policy in regard to saving.<BR> 
<P> 
That same year, 1978, Tom formed Insurer Central Services (ICS) that  
assists  
insurers enter the specialized field of variable annuities and variable life insurance.<BR> 
<P> 
The Savers &amp; Investors League was started in 1988 to educate and  
motivate grass roots voter/taxpayers to challenge and change the way our  
government measures the tax revenue impact of tax deferred savings.   
Towards this end, over the  
intervening years, Tom has worked with legislators, economists, and think tanks to develop legislation that 
meets the proper criteria for the sound taxation of personal saving.<BR>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<hr>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<br>
<p>
The current tax code -- with its high marginal tax rates and thousands of pages of rules, 
regulations, and red tape -- poses a formidable barrier to economic growth. 
<p>
<ul>
<li>It punishes the most dynamic forces for growth in our economy -- the small business owners 
and entrepreneurs who turn bold ideas into new businesses, new jobs, and new products.
<p> 
<li>It discourages working Americans who are trying to save for the future to build a better life 
for themselves and their families.
 <p>
<li>It is endlessly complex and confusing, costing literally billions of dollars in lost time and 
effort.
</ul>
<p>
Tax reform must move toward making the tax code more family friendly and create incentives 
for savings and investment.    
<p>
The congressional leadership has <a href="/taxcom/dole.html">asked</a> the National Commission on Economic Growth and 
Tax Reform to start with a blank piece of paper and design a system that is flatter, fairer, and 
simpler -- one that will encourage strong economic growth and greater opportunity for all.
<p>
The commission will gather the views of American citizens from all walks of life and will 
gather the best  available analysis and evidence from the experts who study and analyze tax 
policy.  The commission is expected to issue its recommendations and its report in December.  
<p>
The commissions report should provide recommendations that will contribute to 
reinvigorating entrepreneurship, risk-taking, savings, investment, and work efforts.  Its goal is 
to produce a report that will make America more competitive and expand the nations 
worldwide leadership in the twenty-first century global economy.

"It is very curious, and perhaps even unprecedented."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The top-secret clearance, requested by Commerce Department executives, was issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) on Dec. 12, 1995 -- after Mr. Huang left the department as deputy assistant secretary for international economic policy and before he reported to work at the DNC.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It remained in effect until Dec. 9, 1996, DISCO records show, although it is not clear how he used the clearance as a top DNC fund-raiser. It could have gained him access to classified meetings and documents.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Huang initially was issued a top-secret security clearance in January 1994, five months before he resigned as a top executive at the Indonesia-based Lippo Group, a multibillion-dollar investment conglomerate, to go to Commerce. He was a vice president at Lippo Bank in Los Angeles and resigned in July 1994 to take over as deputy assistant secretary at Commerce.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Commerce and DNC records are not clear as to when Mr. Huang actually left the government and began as a fund-raiser. The DNC said he started work on Dec. 4, 1995. Commerce said he left the department on Jan. 17, 1996.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>A Commerce memo dated Jan. 31, 1994, said Mr. Huang was granted an interim top-secret clearance before his arrival at Commerce "due to the critical need for his expertise in the new administration for Secretary [Ronald H.] Brown."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The same reasoning was used in December 1995, when the assistant commerce secretary, Charles F. Meissner, asked in a "request for personnel action" that Mr. Huang be retained as a consultant despite his pending departure to the DNC.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Meissner said Mr. Huang would help in the transition period in finding a replacement and his "expertise" on the Asia-Pacific region would be vital to the department's commercial policy planning there. Records show the consultancy eventually was not approved, but the top-secret clearance was granted and remained valid for a year.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Congressional investigators want to know if there was concern at Commerce of a possible conflict of interest regarding Mr. Huang's role as a DNC fund-raiser while serving as a department consultant with a top-secret clearance.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>They also are trying to determine if Mr. Huang was given classified information that may have been leaked to Lippo. Telephone records show that while at Commerce, he made and received dozens of calls from Lippo lobbyists and executives while he worked on sensitive trade missions.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Meissner was among 34 persons, including Mr. Brown, killed in an April plane crash in Croatia.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Huang, who became a U.S. citizen in 1976, is believed to have returned to California. He previously has denied any wrongdoing. As a DNC fund-raiser, he solicited $2.5 million from contributors with Asian business links, $1.5 million of which has been returned.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Meanwhile, Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, New York Republican and chairman of the House Rules Committee, on Jan. 29 asked Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright for copies of letters written by Clinton supporters Ernest G. Green and Charles Yah Lin Trie to help a Chinese arms dealer, Wang Jun, get a visa to visit the United States.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Green, managing director at Lehman Brothers Inc. in Washington and a former Little Rock resident, and Mr. Trie, an Arkansas businessman, made significant contributions to the DNC and to Mr. Clinton after Mr. Wang met with the president in the Oval Office on Feb. 6, 1996.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>According to Federal Election Commission records, Mr. Green gave $50,000 to the DNC on Feb. 7, 1996. Mr. Trie delivered $640,000 to Mr. Clinton's legal-defense fund within a month of the visit. The two men wrote letters of endorsement for the Wang visa, issued by the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>At the time of the White House visit, Mr. Wang headed a Chinese arms company known as Poly Technologies Inc., which makes weapons for the Chinese military. The firm was under investigation by the U.S. Customs Service in a major smuggling operation, and it had been identified by agents as a supplier of 2,000 AK-47s to drug dealers and street gangs in the United States.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"The granting of a visa to the chairman of a weapons-trading company owned by the Chinese military is a matter of great concern," Mr. Solomon said.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Congressional probes of the Lippo Group have since expanded to include a look at the holding company headed by Mr. Wang, known as the Poly Group.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Green has not returned calls for comment. Mr. Trie and Mr. Huang have not been available.</TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=9><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top> <TD ALIGN=left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN="1" ROWSPAN="1"><IMG SRC="../images/vertical.gif" WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" border=0></TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=180><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top><TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><A HREF="mailto:wtadvt@wt.infi.net"><IMG SRC="../ads/house_ad.180.gif" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="TWT House Ad 1" border=0></A></TD></TD></TABLE></TD></TD></TABLE><center><p><a href="#linkTOP">Go back to the top of this article.</A></center></TD></TR>

"I said because it went to the heart of how you define America."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Gingrich said he consistently notes that the Declaration of Independence says "we are endowed by our Creator -- unlike the European model, where rights go from the God to the king."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>From Mr. Gingrich's perspective, the infusion of God into public discourse is both good practice and good politics. In a nation where more than 90 percent of the people profess belief in God, and nearly as many voice frustration with an immoral society, calling on God seems a reach toward reason as Congress wrestles with social problems such as crime, drugs and teen pregnancy.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"There is in America a kind of hunger for people to address the morals and values vacuum that has existed in the public arena," said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, Arkansas Republican, who was once a Baptist preacher.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"I have noticed that the speaker has been speaking more frequently about the need for spiritual renewal and the need for faith in our public life," he said. "I am never reticent about expressing my own personal faith either. That is different than what we do in public policy to release rules or laws or regulations to eliminate the charitable sector from doing more."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The message also plays well within the GOP because more and more elected Republicans profess to be "people of faith," Mr. Hutchinson said.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Moreover, socially conservative Republicans have the backing of the Christian Coalition, which likes the sound of the speaker's religious rhetoric.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Some Democrats have suggested privately that the speaker is following in the footsteps of D.C. Mayor Marion Barry and others who find God a help in rehabilitating themselves after falling on hard times.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But a House leadership source said senior members were "as surprised as you were" to hear Mr. Gingrich's more frequent and fervent mentions of God. He insisted the speaker is not motivated by political gain, but conceded that the message helps with conservative Christian members of the House, who think Mr. Gingrich is too moderate and are frustrated by his ethics problems.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Most members of the 105th Congress are active in some religion --the majority in Protestant denominations, such as Episcopal, Baptist, Methodist and Presbyterian. There is also a large contingent of Roman Catholics. The rest profess to be Greek Orthodox, Jews, Mormons or Christian Scientists.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Partly because of the nation's religious diversity, as reflected in Congress, some are not comfortable with the speaker's new calls on God.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Americans United for Separation of Church and State fired off a letter last month reminding Mr. Gingrich that the Constitution gives public officials no right or duty to involve themselves in the religious life of this country.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Government leaders are not empowered to serve as religious leaders," wrote Barry Lynn, the group's executive director. "It is not your responsibility to determine 'God's will' and then attempt to impose that religious agenda on all Americans through force of law."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>While generic references to God are acceptable, Mr. Lynn said, the speaker directing members to find the will of God is not.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Lynn said one of the main problems with the speaker's position is that it is impossible to find a "nonsectarian" approach.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"We have 1,500 faiths that are practiced in the United States," he said. "Unless he's managed to produce a single set of truths, you cannot have a nonsectarian-but-still-religious solution to public problems."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Lynn said Mr. Gingrich's rhetoric is more troubling than that of others, including President Clinton, who occasionally mention God in a generic sense, because the speaker has a history of advocating issues that erode the constitutional wall between church and state.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Gingrich said he found Mr. Lynn's letter "amazing."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"I would presume they want an entirely secular conversation," he said. "I would ask the author of the letter if they would delete 'Creator' from the Declaration of Independence, and would they delete 'sacred honor,' since both are antithetical from their viewpoint."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The First Amendment forbids government from undertaking any action "respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." That has been interpreted by courts to mean that government may not finance, sponsor or endorse religion but protects its "free exercise."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>These are the parameters around congressional decisions on issues such as prayer in school and federal funding for faith-based organizations that perform social work such as drug rehabilitation. Religious speech has not been considered by the courts to overstep the amendment.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Rep. Charles T. Canady, Florida Republican and chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution, said it is not the speaker's place to dictate what others believe. "But he's not doing that. He's expressing his views.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"The kind of thing the speaker is talking about is for members to seek wisdom from the Creator and seek His blessing on what we are doing. That involves a level of humility that is not very common in our public life."</TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=9><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top> <TD ALIGN=left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN="1" ROWSPAN="1"><IMG SRC="../images/vertical.gif" WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" border=0></TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=180><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top><TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><A HREF="mailto:wtadvt@wt.infi.net"><IMG SRC="../ads/house_ad.180.gif" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="TWT House Ad 1" border=0></A></TD></TD></TABLE></TD></TD></TABLE><center><p><a href="#linkTOP">Go back to the top of this article.</A></center></TD></TR>

Both the president and the first lady have asked me to make this my top priority," Miss Scott wrote on Dec. 7, 1993, to Thomas F.

It even included lists of donors to unrelated Senate campaigns, according to a copy provided to The Times.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The existence of the database was first revealed by The Washington Times last summer.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Federal laws, especially the Hatch Act, prohibit the White House from sharing the information in the list with the Democratic Party.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But another memo obtained by The Washington Times shows that the Democratic National Committee got the list in 1994 as part of their program to send out White House Christmas cards.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Toiv said that the 1994 Christmas-card list was different from the database of political supporters sought by the first lady.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Jan. 30 Los Angeles Times, meanwhile, quoted Truman Arnold, a Texas oilman and former DNC finance chairman, as saying he used the database.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"I started checking back with the White House just as a routine matter," he told the Times. "It didn't seem to be very privileged to me. It was open to a lot of people."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>His comments shocked the administration, which is grappling with other charges that it used the White House to raise money in potential violation of federal laws and doled out invitations to special White House events to big donors.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The DNC issued a statement for Mr. Arnold in which he denied knowing about the database. It included a statement by DNC spokeswoman Amy Weiss Tobe claiming that the party never tapped the database.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Rep. David M. McIntosh, Indiana Republican, is probing the uses of the database, nicknamed "big brother," for the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>He said in an interview that the White House has repeatedly refused to release unedited information about the system and the full committee may seek a subpoena for it this week.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"The database was probably the central brain in their effort to sell the White House" in the re-election campaign, Mr. McIntosh said.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The lawmaker said he plans to call Mr. Arnold in for an interview by the committee.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Toiv on Jan. 30 denied that the administration broke any laws and said the DNC was allowed extremely restricted access to the database.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"The database was not used by the White House to -- for any sort of fund-raising capacity," said Mr. Toiv, rejecting the suggestions by Mr. Arnold that he used the information system to contact donors.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>He said the database could be used only for "official purposes" such as preparing lists of people to invite to social functions.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>In those cases, said Mr. Toiv, the DNC would have a role. "If the DNC, in the context of putting together a list of people that they might want to ask to be invited to an event here, asked the question 'Was this particular person invited to previous events? Or did this person previously attend events at the White House?' then it would be entirely appropriate for the Social Office to answer that question," he said.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The spokesman said that the database included skimpy information on each person, including date of birth, Social Security number and reason for attending a White House event.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But pages of the database shown to The Washington Times show that the White House kept track of donors and identified them with a dollar sign and one entry carried the notation, "major contributor to the DNC."</TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=9><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top> <TD ALIGN=left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN="1" ROWSPAN="1"><IMG SRC="../images/vertical.gif" WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" border=0></TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=180><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top><TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><A HREF="mailto:wtadvt@wt.infi.net"><IMG SRC="../ads/house_ad.180.gif" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="TWT House Ad 1" border=0></A></TD></TD></TABLE></TD></TD></TABLE><center><p><a href="#linkTOP">Go back to the top of this article.</A></center></TD></TR>

After all, without compulsion, what else would induce parents to keep sending their children to schools where costs have skyrocketed at the same time academic standards and performance have declined, where politically correct but historically dubious "history" is taught and Christmas is now just the anniversary of the winter solstice.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Only compulsion could have created an educational bureaucracy so bloated, inefficient and politically driven as ours is, with its enormous cost contributing to an onerous tax burden that leaves the average family with no choice but to send their children to public school.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>No, Judge Higginbotham, I don't buy your argument that expanding school choice to include parochial schools violates the Wisconsin constitution, though it would clearly violate the state's monopoly over the education of its children.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Several years ago I was told that school boards were first created in colonial New England in the late 17th century to preserve orthodoxy.

I was seated next to a rather verbose feminist-activist at the culminating conference banquet along with several other legislators.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>After listening to about 20 minutes of her non-stop advocating that the faculty force administrators to adhere to her prescribed agenda, I dropped her a bombshell in order to turn off the faucet. I commented, "if I were president of a university, I would lay down a set of no-nonsense rules and expect them to be followed. The first breach of the rules would earn the perpetrator 25 strokes of the cane. The second would earn 24 hours in the stocks on the campus lawn."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>She looked at me in shock and dismay, while the others at the table attempted unsuccessfully to suppress giggles, and frowningly said, "that's just like a macho male. How could you do that to your poor students?"<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I promptly replied, "dear madam, I was not referring to the students, I was referring to the faculty!"<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>She sank back in her chair, holding her head as if about to faint, while the surrounding guests broke out in uncontrollable laughter.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>As I write this letter, her reaction reminds me of the well-known television ad where the pompous old lady faints when the country bumpkin says, "would you please pass the jelly?"<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=0>Joseph Plunkett, Ph.D<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=0>Black Rock, Arkansas<FONT SIZE=6><BR><BR>Dale Brown should<BR>share the blame</FONT><BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It was difficult to believe that you would waste print on Dale Brown (Jan. 19 edition), who recently resigned as head basketball coach at Louisiana State University because he said he could no longer hide his disgust with the system. Fans at LSU have been hiding their disgust with him for years.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>If college basketball is rotten, Dale Brown should share the blame. Mr. Brown says he arrived here in an old Volkswagen with $800 in his pocket. He can leave in a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce with perhaps millions in the bank.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It's hard for me to tell if you wrote this as a serious piece of journalism, or to portray the braying of a jackass.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Goodbye, Dale, don't bother to write.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=0>Med Hogg<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=0>Baton Rouge, Louisiana<FONT SIZE=6><BR><BR>Three dollar Bill</FONT><BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>On Monday, Jan. 20, 1997, America witnessed the inaugural Bacchanal of William Jefferson Clinton, the man with a bumper-car set of values capable of rebounding from any opposing force to careen in whatever direction offers a path of less resistance.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>There in the nation's capital were food, drink and games of the circus beyond the wildest imaginings of Gaius and Tiberius Gracchi, the Roman emperors who first drew up the Democratic Party's blueprint for voter control.

Where two years ago, the press were telling us all that the Republicans wanted to throw grandma and grandpa out into the street by daring to propose Social Security reform, those same people in the press are now telling us that the nation's economy is doomed unless we enact that reform now. Everyone is beginning to see Social Security for what it really is, the world's largest Ponzi scheme. That "giant sucking sound" we heard a few years ago was Social Security going down the toilet.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Why don't we let each taxpayer decide if they want to be in or out of the Social Security program?  Just let us have control over our money that is currently being put in. I guarantee that I can do better with that money than the government can.

Insufferable. Unique. Legendary. Courageous. Magnifique.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>By evening's end, the Oct. 22 birthday dinner roast of Arnaud de Borchgrave, the last of the swashbuckling foreign correspondents and the former editor in chief of The Washington Times, was a rich ragout of deliciously conflicting emotions.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Amusement was combined with admiration, together with teasing tributes to the man celebrated for his derring-do -- what Abe Rosenthal, formerly the executive editor of the New York Times and now a columnist there, cited as bravery beyond the call of duty -- and impeccable sang-froid, as well as a wardrobe beyond envy.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Ben Bradlee, the former executive editor of The Washington Post and now the vice president at large, recalled that he was Arnaud's successor as Paris bureau chief of Newsweek. "I have more in common with Wes Pruden than either of us would care to admit. We both succeeded Arnaud. When all is said and done, Arnaud is a pro, a rogue with great charm and wit."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Life begins again at 70," in the words of the tribute from Boutros Boutros-Ghali, secretary-general of the United Nations, brought to the party by his wife, Leia, and this was confirmed by the bonhomie rampant in the ballroom at The Washington Times, attended by 225 colleagues, friends and fans who had flown in from as far away as London and Dubai to honor the man needled as "a legend in his own mind."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Belgian-born count, who renounced a title to embrace U.S. citizenship and a career covering 17 wars in 90 nations, was roasted to a gentle turn between courses by Mr. Bradlee; Osborn Elliott, former editor in chief of Newsweek who was once Arnaud's boss; columnist Taki Theodoracopoulos; and David Abshire, president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and a former assistant secretary of state and U.S. ambassador to NATO. The party was hosted by Dong Moon Joo, the president of The Washington Times.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Elliott called Mr. de Borchgrave "an irreproachable reporter" and "the only person I know who could plant a story about himself just to see how long it would take to come back to him."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Bradlee recalled their days in Newsweek's Paris bureau when Mr. de Borchgrave was Mr. Bradlee's boss, full of stories of such one-upmanship as hiring limos of a size too large to fit between the gates of the estates of the titled people Arnaud was sent to interview. This was Mr. Bradlee's first visit to the newspaper with whom he has traded pointed barbs and sharpened needles over the years, and he was introduced by Wesley Pruden, the editor in chief of The Times, as "a man who has been an inspiration to us at The Times, sort of, particularly in the lean early years when he taught us what Dr. Johnson meant when he said that the prospect of hanging focuses the mind in a wonderful way."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Grace under fire never being his problem, the man who is now the editor at large of The Times and resident foreign-policy expert at CSIS, returned roaster-toaster witticisms with some of his own, culled from a lifetime of experience in a trade he learned from the ground up, first as a clerk at United Press.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"The operative word is truth," he said. "When you learn to fake that, the rest is easy," he said, quoting the slogan that "'Life is really what happens when you make other plans.' I was one of those lucky ones."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Much of the party's zip and flair was credited to Mr. de Borchgrave's wife, Alexandra, radiant in red Chanel. She gathered a cross section of movers and shakers who dance almost as well as they deliver bons mots. A '50s and '60s band, the Hubcaps, played what Mr. Pruden, the emcee, called "what some of us here remember as music."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"It was as sophisticated a gathering as anything put together in this city for a long time," State Department official Patrick Daly said. "I could have spent an entire evening with everyone at each table."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>If so, he might have talked with ambassadors from Britain, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Switzerland, Brazil, Egypt, the Netherlands, Morocco, Thailand, Italy and Qatar; author Christopher Buckley; author and journalist Sally Quinn; television's Sam Donaldson and his journalist wife, Jan Smith; scientific entrepreneur William Haseltine; and such past White House and administration luminaries as Robert Mosbacher, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Fred Malek, Frank Carlucci, Boyden Gray, Lloyd Hand, Robert Kimmitt, Richard Allen, James Schlesinger and William Simon; journalist-historian Michael Beschloss; and such other high-profile journalists as Daniel Schorr, William Safire, Tony Snow, William Tuohy, Emmett Tyrrell, Bernard Kalb and Georgie Anne Geyer.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0><I>By Ann Geracimos</I></TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=12><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top> <TD ALIGN=left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN="1" ROWSPAN="1"><IMG SRC="../images/vertical.gif" WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" border=0></TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=180><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top><TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><A HREF="about.map"><MAP NAME="clientmap2"><AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="1,3,180,59" HREF="aboutnwe.html"></MAP><IMG SRC="images/about.gif" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=MIDDLE border=0 USEMAP="#clientmap2" ISMAP></A></TD></TD></TABLE></TD></TD></TABLE><center><p><a href="#linkTOP">Go back to the top of this page.</A></center></TD></TR>

<title>President's Message</title>
</head>

<body background="/yaf/ground2.gif">


<img alt="Picutre of Reagan and Robinson" src="r&r.gif" align = ><br><h2>President's Message</h2>

You would be very disappointed if you knew what was going on in our schools.<p>

America's public schools and colleges have relinquished their role of defending and transmitting our history, religious heritage, and culture.<p>

Schools are hotbeds of violence, disrespect and failure.<p>

School administrators pass out condoms and teach "tolerance" for deviant lifestyles, but insist they can't "impose" religious values or even ask students to say the Pledge of Allegiance.<p>

Students learn the latest environmental theories but they aren't taught to adequately read, write, or add. <p>

College admissions programs and faculty hirings are rigged. It's better to be designated a member of an "oppressed" class than to be an honor student or an effective teacher.<p>

Our heroes are demeaned. Long-standing American role models are replaced with obscure but "politically correct" characters in a new "multicultural" curriculum.<p>

Thomas Sowell notes that every one of Karl Marx's works is available in our schools' bookstores. But Sowell no longer finds The Federalist Papers.<p>

The Bible is taboo; it's replaced in our grade schools with Heather Has Two Mommies!<p>

The Radical Left decided that its most important goal was to gain control of our educational system.<p>

Radical teachers and administrators promote an agenda that attacks traditional values, causes racial strife, and is preoccupied with envy and class warfare.<p>

Radical feminists institutionalize an anti-family agenda through "Women's Studies" departments and programs.<p>

Militant homosexuals design freshmen orientation programs to force acceptance of their lifestyles and consequently demand a ban on religiously oriented free speech.<p>

Leftist control is so complete that students on many campuses are denied the right to attend ROTC or they are told they cannot form religious clubs.<p>

At the University of Maryland students weren't permitted to display the American flag during the Persian Gulf war!<p>

In 1992 Bill Clinton spoke at fifty campuses, appeared on youth-related television programs, and otherwise targeted the student audience.<p>

President Clinton frequently dispatches his Administration's officials to the college campus, especially Hillary Clinton, Joycelyn Elders, Al Gore, and Robert Reich.<p>


College administrators who have a sordid history of violating students' Constitutional rights, as Donna Shalala did at the University of Wisconsin and Sheldon Hackney at the University of Pennsylvania, are given choice governmental positions.<p>

Our educational system, in which we invest our fortunes and our children, are controlled by people who are hostile to the values we hold dear.<p>

Most of us know there is a problem but we are tempted to underestimate how bad or how damaging it is. <p>

Abraham Lincoln expressed it best, "The philosophy of the school room in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next."<p>

If that holds true, we are in for some very, very hard times.<p>

Can it be more obvious?<p>

Conservatives need to be more active in the education of our nation's young people.<p>

We must demand that our schools be balanced and fair institutions.<p>

That is the mission of Young America's Foundation.<p>

Unfortunately, those who control our schools are not about to voluntarily share power.<p>

In fact, one lesson conservatives have learned is that the Left covets a monopoly over information and education in America.<p>

Young America's Foundation's twenty-five year record is a history of struggle to break the Left's monopoly in our schools.<p>

Leading scholars and policy makers who lecture for the Foundation have made a dramatic impact. Recent nationwide tours by William F. Buckley, Jr., Dinesh D'Souza, Bay Buchanan, Edwin Meese, Bill Bennett, Walter Williams, and Oliver North have been large enough and effective enough to change our campuses for good.<p>

Young America's Foundation has benefited by the involvement and help of Ronald Reagan, Milton Friedman, Phyllis Schlafly, Patrick Buchanan, Dana Rohrabacher, Caspar Weinberger, Robert Dornan, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Jack Kemp, Phil Gramm, and Robert Novak.<p>
	
But it is the students, faculty members and financial supporters are the real heroes of Young America's Foundation's first twenty-five years.<p>

Students invest tremendous time and energy to put on our programs, publish independent papers and journals, and fight faculty and administration pressure to conform to a "politically correct" agenda. Often these young men and women make great personal sacrifices to participate in our activities.<p>

Conservative faculty members are a rare group indeed. Yet those who have dedicated their careers to truly educating their students merit our eternal gratitude. Many deserve mention but I am especially thankful for the help given by Burt Folsom, Forrest McDonald, Richard Ebeling, Walter Williams, Thomas DiLorenzo, Alan Sabrosky, Charles Kesler, Jeffrey Hart, the late Russell Kirk and M.E. Bradford.<p>

Financial supporters have made these programs possible. You have backed up these students and faculty members with the financial support their schools should have provided but didn't.  They have helped create a successful model to inform students of the greatness of our country, its free enterprise heritage, and our many blessings from God.<p>

Each of us must do more to achieve our goal of passing on a heritage of which we can be proud. But it is appropriate to take a short time to reflect on how far we have come. Thank you.<p><p>

<title>Job Prospects for College Graduates</title>
</head>

<body background="/yaf/ground2.gif">

<img alt="Employment Services" src="em-logo.gif"><p>

<p>

<i>	College students, don't despair!  Though the job market is tight, Young America's Foundation can give you a leg up on your competition.  Through our jobs program, Job Prospects for College Graduates, you will know what employers are looking for.  Bring a corporate leader to your school who will tell you what you need to do in college to get a good job when you graduate.  And he will tell you about the realities of the job market.  In addition, a free market economist will tell you about the benefits of the free market system. . . a perspective you won't find often on campuses!<p>
</i>
	College students are wise to be particularly concerned this year about finding a job after graduation.  Studies show that as of graduation day, only 40 percent of the class of 1995 had found a job appropriate for their degree.  That number goes up only to 50 percent by November.  To make matters worse, studies show that employers are losing faith in the ability of colleges to prepare students for the workforce.  They are looking more at the experience of a potential employee rather than their academic record.<p>

	What is the reason for these phenomena?  There are two explanations.  First, the quality of our colleges and universities are eroding.  Except at a few select schools which have maintained their commitment to academic instruction, multicultural and politically correct courses supplant classes with practical value for future employment.  And second, the Clinton Administration's regulatory policies are forcing businesses to forgo expansion.  When employers must hire, they opt for trained, experienced individuals, rather than taking a chance on a new graduate.  Government regulations make the expense and hassle of bringing on even an experienced worker prohibitive.  Why, then, would an employer opt to hire someone fresh out of college, with no experience, and very likely in need of remedial education, in addition to basic job training?<p>

	Do not despair!  Young America's Foundation has a program which will help students maximize their college degree so that employers will snatch them up, or at least give them a chance.  In addition, students will learn the real reasons why it is so tough to get a job for which befits their degree.<p>

<i>	Job Prospects for College Graduates</i> is a program designed to promote an accurate understanding of our free market system of economics.  We seek to dispel the widespread myth, promoted by leftist professors, that "big business" is responsible for the difficulty recent college graduates encounter when they attempt to enter the work force.  Specifically, we are examining the impact of burdensome federal regulations and of the federal government itself in constraining the job market.  In addition, we are focusing on the devaluation of today's college degree given the politicized curricula, and the consequent skepticism of employers of higher education's ability to prepare students for the workplace.<p>

	During the fall of 1995, Young America's Foundation will cosponsor a series of<i> Job Prospects for College Graduates</i> programs on campuses.  At each program, a free market economist and a corporate leader will speak to students giving them the insights they need to maximize their educational opportunities and avoid the pitfalls of a politically correct degree.  In addition, students will gain a unique understanding of their job opportunities and of the qualities employers are seeking in new recruits.<p>

	Young America's Foundation is publishing a monograph written by Dr. Thomas J. DiLorenzo for the Foundation entitled,<i> Job Prospects for College Graduates:  The Role of Government and The Responsibilities of the University.</i>  The monograph will be available to all students.<p>

	If you are interested in hosting Job Prospects for College Graduates at your campus, please contact <a href="mailto:yaf@yaf.org">Steve Slivinski</a> (yaf@yaf.org) at Young America's Foundation: 1-800-292-9231.<p><p>

</td></tr></table>

<P>
<DD>

Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI) soon will introduce the Mandates Information Act of 1997 to amend the existing Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) of 1995 so that new costs and requirements imposed by Congress on the private sector will be subject to as much careful analysis and deliberation as those mandates affecting state and local governments. The 1995 Act permits House and Senate members to raise a point of order on any bill when its intergovernmental mandates, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), exceed $50 million in annual cost. Unless waived by a majority vote, a point of order prohibits further floor action on the measure. Although the <a href="http://www.regulation.org/pl104-4.html">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</a> (P.L. 104-4) also directs the CBO to estimate whether a bill's private-sector mandates exceed $100 million in annual cost, it does not establish a point of order if the mandates exceed that threshold. Senator Abraham's bill would correct this deficiency.

<P>
<DD>

A review of the impact of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act on new intergovernmental mandates strongly suggests that Congress should give serious consideration to extending the point of order to private-sector mandates. Over the past two years, the UMRA has played a significant, positive role in helping Congress more carefully deliberate and assess (and reassess) the financial impact of new mandates. As a result, Congress has eliminated hundreds of millions of dollars in potential new mandate costs.

<P>
<DD>

Extending the UMRA's point of order to private-sector mandates will put the necessary "teeth" behind the CBO's estimates and put these mandates on equal footing with those affecting state and local governments. The Mandates Information Act would extend the point of order for private-sector mandates that exceed a $100 million threshold, and it would direct the CBO to inform Members of Congress about the effects of these mandates on consumers, workers, and small businesses. This bill represents a commonsense improvement to a law that clearly has helped Congress make more informed legislative decisions.

<P>
<B>THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF MANDATES</B>

<P>
<DD>

In an era of fiscal budgetary restraint, private-sector mandates represent a politically appealing alternative to new programs and higher direct taxes. Policymakers rationalize the shifting of new burdens to the private sector on the grounds that the incremental costs of each new social program, when dispersed across all industry, will not be so great as to place U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage. But these mandates really represent a hidden tax, because the costs of implementation are passed on to consumers, employers, employees, and stockholders in the form of higher prices, reduced wages, and lost productivity. <A HREF="fyi129t1.gif">Table 1</A> presents just a small sample of the scope of the already existing federal mandates on employers.

<P>
<DD>

Each separate mandate may be small and appear inconsequential. Taken as a whole, however, mandates and their implementing regulations stretch the ability of firms to adjust and offset their costs. Firms and industries respond to new mandates in ways that are not often obvious. For example:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The Cable Act of 1992 was supposed to protect consumers by lowering the price of basic cable rates by 17 percent. In reality, the legislative mandates lowered the value of cable TV service and raised its effective price.<SUP>1</SUP>  C-SPAN reports that 4.2 million homes have had their service hours reduced and a few towns have lost C-SPAN entirely.<SUP>2</SUP>  Moreover, by reducing cable industry cash flow, the Cable Act has slowed the investment in new technologies that would improve service.
<P>
<LI> Legally mandated benefits, such as family and medical leave and unemployment insurance, are not "free" to the worker, as many policymakers imply. A range of studies indicates that, on average, 88 percent of the cost of all employer-paid government-mandated benefit taxes is shifted to workers in the form of reduced cash compensation.<SUP>3</SUP>
<P>
<LI> Over the years, more and more mandates and higher and higher taxes have increased the cost of hiring workers. In 1995, the cost of government-mandated benefits accounted for 8.9 percent of total employer payrolls, up from 6.3 percent in 1971 and 3.5 percent in 1951.<SUP>4</SUP>
<P>
<LI> The recently enacted increase in the minimum wage will cost consumers and workers about $2.2 billion per year as the cost of entry-level jobs is passed on through higher prices and lower real wages. It also will cause employers to create over 200,000 fewer entry-level jobs each year until 1999.<SUP>5</SUP>
</UL>

<P>
<DD>
Regulatory mandates emanating from legislation impose the heaviest burden on small and medium-sized businesses. For firms with fewer than 20 employees, the regulatory costs<SUP>6</SUP> per employee are estimated to be about $5,500. For the largest firms (those with more than 500 employees), the cost is about $3,000 per employee.<SUP>7</SUP>  Unfortunately, Congress has responded to the disproportionate burden on small business by exempting different sizes of companies from different regulatory statutes. The effect of this approach has been to discourage companies that are near an established threshold from hiring new employees.<SUP>8</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
Over the past 30 years, the cumulative effect of federal mandates has had a significant impact on productivity and take-home pay.<SUP>9</SUP>  Sound policymaking requires that basic information is provided to permit a thorough evaluation of the impact of any new federal mandate under consideration.
<P>

<B>THE SUCCESSES OF THE UNFUNDED MANDATES REFORM ACT OF 1995</B>

<P>
<DD>
In response to the increasingly hostile reaction of states and localities to unchecked and costly federal mandates, Congress passed, and President Clinton signed on March 22, 1995, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. One of the objectives of the act is to give Members of Congress information about the costs of proposed new public- and private-sector mandates so they can deliberate more carefully about them. In doing so, Congress would be less likely to make state and local governments and the private sector pay for programs and projects it refuses to pay for itself.<SUP>10</SUP>  A 1996 report by the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations noted, on the origins of the act, that the "Washington tendency has been to treat as a national issue any problem that is emotional, hot and highly visible. Often this has meant passing a federal law that imposes costs and requirements on state and local governments without their consent and without regard for ability to comply."<SUP>11</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
Beginning on January 1, 1996, the CBO began providing congressional committees with estimates of the direct costs of mandates in bills reported out of committee and, to the extent practicable, for conference agreements.<SUP>12</SUP>  Since that time, the CBO has reviewed more than 400 bills. Because of the CBO's role in estimating the costs of new public- and private-sector mandates, many Members of the 104th Congress and their staffs worked closely with the budget office in the earliest stages of developing legislation. Members did not want to risk being embarrassed by introducing a bill that subsequently would be subject to a point of order (in the case of a public-sector mandate) for having a huge unfunded mandate. There are a number of examples of how these additional consultations and deliberations initially resulted in important policy changes in legislation considered during the 104th Congress:<SUP>13</SUP>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Health care reform.</B> The CBO performed one of its most complex analyses under the UMRA on health care reform legislation (H.R. 3103), which included provisions to improve insurance portability and to require insurers to cover mental health services the same as they cover acute care services. The CBO estimated that premiums for traditional fee-for-service plans would increase by 5.3 percent because of this provision alone, while managed care plans would see an extra increase of 4 percent.<SUP>14</SUP>  Recognizing that workers and their families, rather than employers, invariably bear the real cost of any mandated benefits, the CBO stated that many employers would respond simply by dropping benefits -- or even health insurance altogether -- for employees and their families.<SUP>15</SUP>  For employers who retained the congressionally mandated package, the higher costs simply would be passed back to employees in lower wages. This reduction in family income also would mean a reduction in federal tax revenues of approximately $9.3 billion between 1997 and 2002.<SUP>16</SUP>  Although not subject to a point of order, the mental health coverage parity provisions were eventually dropped. But many of the other requirements of the Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Care Coverage and Affordability Act (P.L. 104-191), including the requirement of health care portability, remained intact.<SUP>17</SUP>  A modified version of the mental health parity provision subsequently was reconsidered and adopted, but the CBO estimates helped to ensure that a more flexible, less costly option was chosen.

<P>

<LI><B>Immigration.</B> The benefits of CBO input were evident in the development of the immigration bill. Originally, the Senate bill required that all driver's licenses without valid Social Security numbers would be invalid immediately upon the date of enactment of the law. The CBO estimated that this would cost the states in the range of $80 million to $200 million to make the necessary changes to handle the volume of people who would suddenly need to obtain new licenses.<SUP>18</SUP>  This provision was changed in the final legislation to include a 10-year phase-in period, allowing states to renew licenses whenever they normally would come up for renewal. This lowered the costs to states to around $20 million. A similarly structured provision to standardize all birth certificates also was changed to allow for a gradual phase-in period.

<P>
<LI><B>Agriculture.</B> The House version of the farm bill contained provisions that would require milk sold for fluid uses to contain greater amounts of nonfat solids than currently required and lock in higher fluid milk prices under the archaic Milk Marketing Order System. The CBO estimated the direct costs of this provision on dairy processors and manufacturers would fall somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion annually.<SUP>19</SUP>  The final farm bill did not contain the higher fluid milk standards, and the CBO's estimates were used to help make the case for their elimination.

<P>
<LI><B>Minimum wage.</B> The CBO estimated the cost of the Senate proposal to increase the minimum wage in two annual steps from $4.25 to $5.15 per hour. The private-sector costs were estimated to be in the range of $2 billion to $4 billion between 1997 and 2000.<SUP>20</SUP>  The costs to state and local government were in the range of $180 million to $300 million between 1997 and 2000.<SUP>21</SUP>  Because proposals to raise the minimum wage were politically very popular, a point of order based on the public-sector costs did little to stop the legislation because it had overwhelming support. Nevertheless, the CBO's estimates certainly helped to highlight for the public the significant costs of raising the minimum wage, and the need to override a point of order to enact the proposal meant that Members would be subject to a recorded vote on the question of an unfunded mandate.

</UL>
<P>
<DD>
As these examples illustrate, Congress initially appeared to deliberate as carefully about private-sector mandates as it did about public-sector mandates.
<P>

<B>THE BACKTRACKING: A WEAKENING OF WILL IN THE 104th CONGRESS</B>

<P>
<DD>
Unfortunately, by the end of the 104th Congress, Members had become much more willing to accept costly new private-sector mandates. The will of Congress to carry out the spirit and intent of the act appeared to be weakening. Although Congress and the American people had rejected two years earlier the wholesale attempt by the Clinton Administration to have the government dictate what kind of health care Americans should get and how much they should pay for it, Members began -- measure by measure, benefit by benefit -- to federalize and standardize private health insurance toward the end of the 104th Congress. They were laying the foundation for the kind of Clinton-style health care system, replete with new bureaucracy and federal regulatory controls, that they once had opposed steadfastly.<SUP>22</SUP>
<P>
<UL>

<LI> For example, the 104th Congress adopted an amendment offered by Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) to the FY 1997 Veterans Administration and Housing and Urban Development (VA-HUD) appropriations bill that requires insurers to cover a mother and newborn for at least two nights in the hospital after a normal birth, and at least four nights after a Cesarean section. Coverage for fewer days would be permissible if agreed to by the attending physician in consultation with the mother. The CBO estimates that Senator Bradley's maternity benefit mandate would cost the federal government alone some $223 million over four years in increased outlays for Medicaid and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and in lost revenues due to lower wages from increased health costs. The CBO also says that the new maternity benefit would increase aggregate premium payments for employee-based and individually purchased health plans by 0.06 percent. In addition to the extra costs for government programs, the CBO estimates that direct private-sector costs would increase by $180 million in 1998 and by $220 million in 2001.<SUP>23</SUP>

<P>
<LI>In addition, Congress adopted a mental health "parity" amendment offered by Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Paul Wellstone (D-MN). This amendment is a scaled-down version of the mental health parity provision dropped from the recently enacted Kennedy-Kassebaum health insurance reform bill. According to a CBO analysis conducted on behalf of the Senate Budget Committee, it is estimated that the Domenici-Wellstone mental health parity provision of the VA-HUD appropriations bill would cost the federal government $590 million in lost revenues between 1997 and 2002 (the provision will sunset in 2001). The intergovernmental mandate would cost just under $50 million, and the private-sector mandate probably would exceed the threshold.<SUP>24</SUP>  The potential cost was reduced somewhat by a modifying amendment, offered by Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX), stipulating that if a group health policy experienced a premium increase of 1 percent or more in a given year due to this provision, that insurance policy could be exempted from the mandate.<SUP>25</SUP>
</UL>
<P>
<DD>
Commenting on these new federal health mandates, <I>The Washington Post</I> warned:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Because the estimated cost of these [proposals] is low, the sponsors say the question isn't real, not now at any rate. But sooner or later as Congress yields to the understandable impulses to help people who need it without, of course, appropriating funds, it becomes real.... What's troubling about the agreements that have just been reached is not so much what they themselves actually do as what they portend.<SUP>26</SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>THE 105th CONGRESS: A FLOOD OF NEW MANDATES?</B>

<P>
<DD>
Indeed, the agreements reached at the end of the 104th Congress portend that the 105th Congress is poised to continue down this path in health care reform and other areas. Recent proposals include:
<P>
<UL>

<LI> Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Representative Greg Ganske (R-IA) have expressed their intention to sponsor legislation that would prohibit the contractual restrictions -- or "gag clauses"--by which certain health maintenance organizations limit the communications of participating doctors with their patients regarding the patients' condition or treatment options. An earlier attempt in the 104th Congress to attach the proposal to the FY 1997 omnibus appropriations bill failed. A recent study by Multinational Business Services, Inc., a consulting firm, estimated that this bill would require hiring between 3,000 and 7,000 new federal employees to monitor complaints affecting more than 345 million contracts between physicians and HMOs.<SUP>27</SUP>

<P>
<LI> Representatives Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) and Anna Eschoo (D-CA) have introduced a bill (H.R. 164) to require private insurance companies to pay for "minimum" hospital stays of two days for mastectomy and one day for a lymph node removal unless doctor and patient "decide less time is appropriate."  This proposal would put Congress in the position of setting benefits and legislating, in effect, the kinds and conditions -- and even the duration -- of medical treatments and procedures that must be covered by health insurance policies. This is arguably far beyond Congress's constitutional authority, and certainly beyond its professional competence.

<P>
<LI> Congress is considering proposals to extend health care coverage for children. Senators Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and John Kerry (D-MA) are considering a proposal to provide block grants to states for a health care voucher program. States would be required to contract with a private health insurer to provide a federally approved health benefits package to eligible pregnant women and children. Although the CBO has not prepared a formal cost estimate, the sponsors of the proposal have estimated the cost to the federal government to be in the vicinity of $25 billion over five years in direct outlays to the states.

<P>
<LI> Representative William Clay (D-MO) has introduced a bill (H R. 109) to expand coverage of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to include businesses with 25 or more workers, as well as adding another three working days (24 hours) of leave that can be taken on an intermittent basis for school functions and routine doctor visits. Although such a change is politically appealing, mandating such leave takes away the ability of the employer and employee to craft the benefits package they want. The federal government increasingly is restricting the ability of workers and employers to negotiate the balance between salary and benefits. In the end, employees lose because the mandates will reduce real wages and other benefits. A much better alternative to expansion of the FMLA is the concept of "flex-time."  Senator John Ashcroft (R-MO) has introduced a bill (S. 4) that would enable employers to offer their employees a choice between taking overtime pay as cash or taking extra time off.<SUP>28</SUP>  Employers also could offer paid flexible leave and a biweekly work schedule to their workers similar to those now available to employees of the federal government. Under paid flexible leave, a salaried employee may choose to work additional hours (more than the traditional 40 hours) during one work week in order to use those extra hours to "fill in" for hours in a shorter work week later.

<P>
<LI> Representative Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) has introduced a bill (H.R. 182) that would require federal contractors (with contracts over $10,000) to pay an hourly wage equivalent to the poverty level for a family of four, or $7.50 per hour (whichever is greater), to all workers. Mandating federal contractors to pay each of their workers at least $7.50 per hour regardless of the size of their family or the region in which they live will raise the cost of federal contracts -- an increase that will be borne by all U.S. taxpayers.
</UL>
<P>

<B>WHAT THE ABRAHAM BILL WOULD DO</B>

<P>
<DD>
These new mandates are just a handful of the proposals that are being considered or that already have been introduced in the first month of the 105th Congress. Although the CBO currently is required to estimate whether a bill's private-sector mandates exceed $100 million, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act does not allow for a point of order for mandates that meet this threshold.

<P>
<DD>
Senator Abraham's bill would strengthen the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act to ensure that Congress has the best information possible on the impact of these types of proposed new federal mandates -- especially on consumers, workers, and small businesses -- by requiring the CBO to provide more detailed analyses than it is currently required to provide. Moreover, armed with that information, a Member could raise a point of order on a mandate affecting private individuals and firms -- not just government entities, as is the case today. A point of order would require more careful deliberation, and a recorded vote, on the mandate.

<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>

<P>
<DD>
Americans are justifiably concerned about the growing attractiveness of using new mandates as a way to expand the size and cost of government. The costs of these mandates are largely hidden. Although the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act does little to address the serious concerns state and local governments and the private sector have about existing mandates,<SUP>29</SUP> it has been a success in making the costs of proposed new mandates less hidden to Congress and the public. The UMRA has a unique track record of helping Congress make more informed decisions by providing necessary information on the cost of legislation before Members vote. Its passage in 1995 was the beginning of a positive, fundamental change in the scope and nature of federal actions affecting state and local governments and the private sector. But the lack of a point-of-order provision for private-sector mandates blunts its effectiveness.

<P>
<DD>
By adopting Senator Abraham's Mandates Information Act, Congress can reaffirm its commitment to moving forward and doing an even better job than the 104th Congress. Unfortunately, the 105th Congress already is poised to impose new private-sector mandates as alternatives to costly new programs and higher taxes. If Congress fails to take control of the use of both public- <I>and</I> private-sector mandates as a substitute for spending, however, the economic and social benefits of efforts to control federal spending and balance the budget will be diminished significantly.

<blockquote>

"Deregulation often is a cost-saver, but in the hands of a bureaucracy, it can lead to additional waste. Consider the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Native American Housing Program, which has enjoyed aspects of regulatory freedom in the last three years. The program was designed to remedy poor housing conditions among tribes, but instead, the agency has poured millions of tax dollars into upscale housing for tribe officials.
<P>
"Since 1992, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, has been transferring control of this program from Washington to the tribes, a decision that appears to reflect a commitment to federalism, a return of governmental power to the states and local areas. But a six-month investigation by <I>The Seattle Times</I> recently found that tribal housing officials, many in northwestern states, skimmed program funds and used them to upgrade their own real estate. Among the findings:
<P>
<LI> A tribal official in Washington State built a house worth $400,000, with grants intended for low-income tribe members.
<P>
<LI> Also in Washington, $800,000 in HUD funds earmarked for emergency home repairs went to custom remodel ten houses.
<P>
<LI> In Idaho, $1.8 million from HUD was spent building four large houses.
"New England also had its fair share of waste. A tribe in Connecticut that earns$1 million a day through its casino and has no low-income members received a $1.5 million HUD grant, which it is using to build fifteen large houses."

<h2>The Citizen Senator</h2>
<b>By Nick Schulz </b>
<p>
<b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i><br>
<a href="/heritage/p_review/jan97/toc.html">January-February 1997, Number 81</a></b> </center>

<p> 
<dd>
<h3>
Members of Congress have traditionally defined compassion by how much of other people's money they spend on their favorite causes. Perhaps it's time for a new definition: How senators and representatives use their own time and leadership skills to help organizations that aid the needy. Here are the stories of four legislators who, without relying on government tax collectors, are making an extraordinary difference in people's lives:</h3>
<p>
<center><h3> Rep. Mark Neumann</h3></center>

<p> 
<dd>	<a href="http://www.house.gov/neumann/welcome.html">Mark Neumann</a>, a sophomore congressman from Wisconsin, is a risk-taker. In 1980, he started a homebuilding company that promptly lost money. He pressed on. By 1991, he had established a thriving construction firm, Neumann Developments, that employs several hundred workers.
<p> 
<dd>
	But if you ask Neumann about success and overcoming the odds, he'll tell you to talk to Eileen McCaffrey. As head of the Orphan Foundation of America (OFA), she works with a lot of children who find the odds stacked against them. The OFA is a scholarship and grant program that offers college tuition to kids who have bounced around foster homes their whole lives. "Kids who come from disadvantaged backgrounds need help on three fronts if they are going to succeed," McCaffrey says. "They need to know they belong in a community, they need to develop some life skills, and they need opportunity. And that's where we and our scholarship program come in." 

<p>
<table width="210" align="right" cellpadding="4"><tr>
<td>
<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>Some members of Congress are helping the needy the old-fashioned way -- one on one.</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>  

<p> 
<dd>	That's where Neumann comes in as well. Though he sits on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, Neumann -- if pressed -- might tell you raising money for the OFA is the most significant thing he does in Washington.
<p> 
<dd>	Neumann rarely passes up an opportunity to ask his colleagues to support the charity. "Sometimes when we are assembled on the House floor for a vote, I'll go up to other members and ask them if they could help out the foundation," he says. "In my Christmas cards, I've included donation slips in case people want to send the OFA some money." He, along with several congressional colleagues, belongs to a ragtag rock band called "The Amendments," which performs benefit concerts for the Orphan Foundation. His efforts have translated into thousands of dollars in scholarship money for needy kids. In June, the congressman announced that five new scholarships worth $500 each were available for foster children in his Wisconsin congressional district.
<p> 
<dd>	In most states, foster-care assistance runs out when a recipient hits his 20th birthday. Once foster care ends, those in the system are immediately left to their own devices, which makes it difficult for them to escape the cycle of dependency. More than 40 percent of homeless adults spent time in foster care as children, McCaffrey says. Only 50 percent of children in foster care ever graduate from high school. Those who do typically have trouble getting into college, for both economic and academic reasons.
<p> 
<dd>	"All too often these kids have been in four or five different schools and maybe they don't have a lot of extra-curriculars," McCaffrey says. "They aren't too attractive to the traditional scholarship sources."
<p> 
<dd>	The OFA targets at-risk youngsters and helps them gain access to universities, community colleges, and trade and technical schools so they can make the transition from foster care to self-sufficiency. Toward that end, Neumann is helping McCaffrey organize an OLIVER project fund-raiser. OLIVER (an acronym for "Orphan Leadership Initiative: Values, Education, Resources") is a week-long Washington event in which orphans meet with public officials and policymakers, attend career workshops to help them develop the skills needed to look for a job, and set up internships with government officials and businesses.
<p> 
<dd>	"Mark has done so much to help us get recognized on Capitol Hill by talking our organization up with his friends," McCaffrey says. Even social workers in Neumann's district -- adversaries when it comes to policy issues -- are taking note. "They may not be sympathetic to what some in the Republican Congress and Mark are trying to do politically," she says, "but they respect what he does for us. They think he's terrific."
<p><center><h3>Senator Dan Coats</h3></center>
<p> 
<dd><a href="http://www.senate.gov/~coats/">Dan Coats</a> remembers that day in 1985 as if it were yesterday. Standing with his family in an anxious crowd, the music playing softly, he turned to the back of the church as the doors opened. C.J.'s bride made her way down the aisle to greet her groom on the most important day of their lives. Coats was struck at how much the bride reminded him of his wife Marcia on their wedding day 20 years earlier. Dan Coats was immensely proud. C.J., he thought, he's going to make it. 	
<p> 
<dd>In the early 1970s, when the Hoosier first met C.J. in a Big Brother program in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, he wasn't so sure. C.J. was growing up on some of the toughest streets of Ft. Wayne, where good male role models are hard to find, and it had taken its toll.	
<p> 
<dd>Big Brothers is a mentoring program that matches fatherless youngsters with responsible, caring men. It has 500 chapters nationwide. "These are kids coming from extremely underprivileged backgrounds," Coats says. "They have suffered an assortment of unfortunate experiences at an early age. They have trouble forming coherent opinions and values about the world in part because they've never had strong male role models to look to for guidance." 	
<p> 
<dd>Big Brothers is one of the most effective mentoring programs on the map: According to Public/Private Ventures, participation in Big Brothers cuts first-time drug use by 46 percent, reduces school absenteeism by 52 percent, and reduces violent behavior by 33 percent. The numbers, according to the Philadelphia-based research group, are consistent across all races.	
<p> 
<dd>Although Coats last year proposed an ambitious legislative package of tax credits and programs to empower needy families, he is quick to acknowledge the limits of government action. Government programs, he says, rarely get at the root causes of social problems.	
<p> 
<dd>That's a warning he picked up from a black minister in Macon, Georgia. The minister bluntly told Coats and other politicians at a hearing that "resources and money are not enough. The moral and spiritual sides of the person are more important." The warning has stuck with Coats, and helped cement his commitment to Big Brothers. 	
<p> 
<dd>In recent years, Coats has served on the National Board of Big Brothers, raising funds and drawing attention to the need for more mentors. With more kids entering the program every year, mentors are being assigned groups of five youngsters, which Coats says dilutes its effectiveness. "Programs such as these can have such a powerful impact because they provide more than just material needs. They are able to address the needs of the whole person, which makes them quite different from government programs."<p>
<center><h3>Senator Thad Cochran </h3></center>

<p> 
<dd>	We walked together in the shadow of all the great monuments on the Mall here in Washington, D.C. We even got to see Connie Mack and the Philadelphia Athletics play in Boston against the Red Sox." These were some of <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~cochran/">Thad Cochran's</a> earliest memories as a Boy Scout in Mississippi. 	
<p> 
<dd>Cochran was a devoted Scout as a young boy. Later he helped found a new Scout troop at Spring Ridge Methodist Church and served as its first junior assistant Scout master. Of the nearly 100 million scouting alumni of the 86-year-old program, Cochran is among the 2 percent who reached the rank of Eagle Scout, an accomplishment of which he is immensely proud. The senator has hung up his uniform, but still considers himself an "honorary Scout master" as he helps the Boy Scouts of America today by raising funds nationwide and by escorting Scout troops around Capitol Hill for a first-rate civics lesson. 	

<p>
<table width="180" align="left" cellpadding="4"><tr>
<td>
<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>"We cannot sustain a nation," says Senator Thad Cochran, "whose citizens have no sense of obligation to others or their country."</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p> 
<dd>Cochran has for many years been an active spokesman for the Boy Scouts. "Within the Scout troop, young men learn the role of a good citizen," he says. "They learn that there are rules in life that need to be obeyed and that emergencies and dilemmas will confront you that cannot be ignored. These are lessons that need to be learned and at a very young age." Indeed, these are lessons which, when learned early and put into practice, can produce substantial accomplishments. Just ask William Lugg. 	
<p> 
<dd>An Eagle Scout, William was one of 10 recent winners of the Presidential Environmental Youth Award. Lugg, along with the rest of Scout Post No. 220 from Van Nuys, California, logged more than 9,500 hours of building and maintaining trails in forests, parks, and camps in an effort to "make nature available to everyone." They built access paths to local lakes; developed booklets and signs in various languages, including Braille, for nature trails; and restored the habitats of endangered fish in canyon riverbeds. They also initiated programs to encourage other concerned citizens to do the same. Brought to Washington for a tour of the capital and the presentation of the award by Vice President Gore, Lugg received private grants to continue his environmental restoration projects. 	
<p> 
<dd>Cochran applauds the Scouts for fostering the work ethic and for expanding children's goals and horizons. "The conferral of merit badges for excellence in achievement and good works reinforces the notion that hard work will be rewarded," he says. "Nothing comes for free." The Boy Scouts confer merit badges for everything from the study of art or atomic energy to excellence in public speaking or wilderness survival. All Scouts are subjected to high standards for demonstrating sufficient ability in each merit field. More than 85 million merit badges have been conferred since the Boy Scouts were founded, in 1910. 	
<p> 
<dd>"The Scouts helped me by expanding my world view," says Cochran. "I came from a small, rural community in Mississippi. Our Scout troop went to Washington, D.C.; Valley Forge, Pennsylvania; and New York City. Those trips have a great impact on a young man's horizons. Given my background in Mississippi, I might never have thought of becoming a civil servant on a national level had it not been for my visit to Washington as a Scout." Cochran was one of more than 300 former Scouts in the 104th Congress. 	
<p> 
<dd>How does Cochran's devotion to the scouting ethic affect his political views as a U.S. Senator? Cochran doubts the wisdom of some recent proposals to remove all incentives for charitable giving or civic action from the tax code. "I had a friend donate some property of his to the Boy Scouts, and I can assure you he wouldn't have done it if it hadn't been for the tax incentive to do so. That's just the way people are. We need to understand the implications of removing [the charitable deduction]. There are other problems that could be created if we're not careful." 	
<p> 
<dd>The transmission of values from one generation to the next, says Cochran, is the most important obligation adults owe their children, their communities, and their country. No sooner do we forget this than our experiment in liberal democracy is lost. "We cannot sustain a nation whose citizens have no sense of obligation to others or their country. We need to support the groups and associations, like the Boy Scouts, that do a good job in promoting strong citizenship. It's a reciprocal relationship." <p>

<center><h3>Rep. Jim Ramstad</h3></center>

<p> 
<dd> 	It was the winter of 1982 and Minnesota state senator <a href="gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/1d-1%3A11169%3ARep.%20Ramstad%2C%20Jim%20MN03">Jim Ramstad</a> could hardly believe his eyes. When Shemsiya "Mimi" Ayanew arrived at the hospital, her skin was blue. She couldn't walk. She suffered from atrial septal defect -- a hole in her heart. She would not live another month without serious corrective heart surgery.	
<p> 
<dd>A few months earlier, Mimi's family had sought help from the Children's Heart Link, a medical charity, as a last, desperate hope for their daughter. Ramstad, having offered his services to Heart Link, sponsored Mimi to fly her from her home in Ethiopia to Minneapolis for corrective surgery.	

<table width="210" align="right" cellpadding="4"><tr>
<td>
<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>"When I first saw Mimi, " says Rep. Jim Ramstad, "she was in terrible shape. The next time I saw her she had her life restored."</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p> 
<dd>"I remember it vividly," Ramstad says. "When I first saw Mimi, she was wheeled into the hospital and was in terrible shape. Then the next time I saw her, she had a big smile on her face and she was running up and down the hospital halls. She had her life restored. It is an incredible feeling to know that you've touched someone's life in that way."	
<p> 
<dd>The Children's Heart Link is an international medical charity founded in 1969 to treat and help prevent heart disease in children. An American G.I. stationed in Vietnam encountered three village children with heart defects in need of surgery, but the only place with the necessary technology and skills was the United States. He arranged for them to be flown to Minnesota, and the only international heart-care charity of its kind was born.	
<p> 
<dd>Today, Heart Link works in conjunction with cardiovascular units located in developing countries throughout the world, providing treatment for needy kids who otherwise might not have access to quality heart care. Sometimes Heart Link sends American doctors overseas -- to places like Costa Rica, Kenya, and Ethiopia -- to perform surgery. 	
<p> 
<dd>The charity also is establishing clinics and training centers in Central and South America and Africa. American doctors and nurses are sent to teach local medical students and technicians a range of skills, such as giving echocardiographic exams, administering cardiac catheterizations, and performing surgery.	
<p> 
<dd>About 1 percent of children around the world are born with some sort of heart condition. Of those, one-third will die without some medical treatment, either in the form of medicine or surgery. The clinics sponsored by Heart Link received 24,000 pediatric patients last year and performed more than 1,500 heart surgeries. And over $200,000 in medical supplies and devices was donated and distributed to developing countries. By establishing clinics overseas and educating and training the local medical caregivers, Heart Link is better able to provide the vital follow-up care that children with heart conditions need.	
<p> 
<dd>Heart Link raises funds from private donors by hosting celebrity benefits and auctions. Last year, it held its biggest annual event, a gala in Minneapolis featuring Kirby Puckett, then an all-star outfielder for the Minnesota Twins. Puckett enlisted some fellow sports stars, including the Baltimore Orioles' Cal Ripken, to play in a celebrity billiard tournament to raise money. The remainder of funds come through direct-mail solicitation.	
<p> 
<dd>Today, Ramstad is a congressman from Minnesota's Third District. He still helps out his favorite charity as a board member, raising funds for the medical supplies necessary to sustain the operation.

<B>The Cost.</B> The rising cost of higher education is one of the major concerns facing American families today. The cost of public higher education has risen sharply over the past two decades compared with the average family income and general rate of inflation. Since 1980, average tuition costs at public universities have increased 234 percent, but the general rate of inflation and the average household income have increased only about 80 percent.<SUP>1</SUP>


<P>
<DD>
<B>The Reward.</B> A college education significantly increases an individual's earning power. According to the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), "a graduated college student in 1980 earned about 43 percent more per hour than a person with a high school diploma. By 1994, this earnings advantage increased to 73 percent."<SUP>2</SUP> Thus, while families are finding it increasingly difficult to pay for college without incurring a tremendous amount of debt, the cost of not going to college makes these sacrifices difficult to avoid.


<P>
<DD>
<B>The Uncertainty.</B> The problem is not just that college costs a lot, but that the cost is uncertain, making it hard for families to know how much they must put aside or what debt they or their children will have to incur to pay for a college education. Over the past decade alone, increases in annual private college costs have fluctuated between 5 percent and 8.6 percent. Increases in tuition at public universities have fluctuated even more.

<P>
<DD>
To understand just how big a difference this fluctuation makes in a family's financial planning, consider a young couple saving for their newborn child's college costs. If tuition and fees at a private university keep rising at the same rate they have over the last few years, parents with a new child today will have to come up with just over $100,000 -- <I>in today's dollars</I> -- when that child heads off to college. If those costs rose two percentage points faster than today's pace, more like the average increase since 1980, the tab would be over $150,000. Two points less than today's rate of increase would mean about $75,000. This kind of financial uncertainty makes planning difficult, to say the least.

<P>
<DD>
<B>Federal plans.</B> To date, the federal government has responded to rising tuition costs by creating programs that 1) give cash grants to qualified students, 2) guarantee private student loans, or 3) lend money directly to students. For most families, this means the federal government makes it easier to get into debt. But the government does little to help families save for college and nothing to deal with the uncertainty of costs.

<P>
<DD>
<B>State prepaid plans.</B> Fortunately, several states and a handful of private firms have taken an innovative step forward in making saving for college easier and more certain. The most innovative of these plans -- prepaid tuition programs -- allow parents to purchase what amounts to a bond denominated in units of education (like one semester). These bonds typically can be purchased at today's tuition prices even if the buyer's children will not reach college age for many years. When the time for college arrives, parents redeem the pre-purchased bond for education credits regardless of the cost at that time. The only major drawback is that the bonds must be used in-state; otherwise, much of the interest is lost upon redemption.

<P>
<DD>
Typically, the accrued interest in the state savings program is not taxed at the state level. Last year, Congress and the President made the state savings plans even more attractive by deferring federal income taxes on the bond's interest until the student enters college and the bond is redeemed; the interest is taxed at the child's tax rate, which usually is lower than the rate that applies to parents. Since the measure was passed, several more states have begun to investigate the feasibility of establishing an education savings plan.

<P>
<DD>
<B>What's needed to boost savings for college.</B> Congress and the President should go even further in their support of both state and private plans which encourage family savings for higher education rather than debt. Specifically, Congress and the President should:
<P><UL>

<LI><B>Make</B> the buildup of earnings in state-sponsored tuition savings plans completely tax-free;
<LI><B>Extend</B> the tax-free status of earnings to investments with private firms that offer special higher education savings vehicles; and 
<LI><B>Direct</B> the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to sanction a private futures market for education savings bonds.
</UL>

<P>
<DD>
<B>Encouraging savings rather than debt.</B> These steps are significant because they help reduce uncertainty and will enable more American families to afford college education. But they also will achieve another long-term goal: Rather than shackle families and graduates with years of debt, as current methods have done, these plans will encourage families to finance their children's college education through savings.

<P>
<B>UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEMS</B>

<P>
<DD>
<B>The Rising Costs of Higher Education.</B> The cost of higher education has been rising sharply for the past 25 years. The General Accounting Office recently reported that average tuition costs at public universities have increased since 1980 by 234 percent, much faster than earnings and general inflation.<SUP>3</SUP>  Tuition expenses at private universities have increased even more rapidly over the same period (see <A HREF="bg1101c1.gif">Chart 1</A>). These increases have outstripped the general increase in prices as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which has increased by 85 percent since 1980, and the average family's ability to pay for college as measured by household income, which has increased only 82 percent since 1980.

<P>
<DD>
There are many important reasons for the explosion in college costs. These include:

<P>
<DD>
<B>The increasing value of a college degree.</B> The most important reason college costs have escalated is that the value of a college education has increased. The GAO reports that in 1980, the average college graduate earned about 43 percent more than the average high school graduate. Today, the difference in earnings between the same two workers is more than 70 percent.<SUP>4</SUP>  Therefore, more and more families are finding it necessary to send their children to college so they will have a better opportunity to succeed in the job market. The real value of a college education has increased. The increased demand for a college education has driven up the price of college just as increased demand for any commodity drives up prices if demand is not met with a sufficiently increased supply.

<P>
<DD>
<B>Increases in research activities at universities and colleges.</B> Another factor affecting tuition costs at many colleges and universities is an increased emphasis on research. The prestige of a college or university today is driven in large part by the publishing prowess of the institution's professors. Publishing requires research, which requires time. This means that professors are doing less teaching and more research; and less teaching on the part of each professor means either that course and class selection are reduced, which forces students to take longer to finish a degree, or that more professors are required on staff, which forces the institution to spend more for salaries.<SUP>5</SUP>  Either way, the result is higher fixed or overhead costs, which typically are passed on to students and parents through higher tuition and fees.<SUP>6</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
<B>Reduced state funding.</B> In addition, the current era of fiscal austerity in government has meant slower growth in state budgets, which often has meant slower growth in financial support of public universities. Increased tuition has been the only recourse for public institutions faced with higher salaries and increased demand.

<P>
<DD>
<B>Federal programs that facilitate family debt.</B> Finally, federal programs meant to assist students facing steep college costs have themselves added to the rise in tuition.<SUP>7</SUP>  Starting with passage of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), the federal government has guaranteed student loans extended by private banks. The Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae) was established in 1972 as a government-sponsored enterprise to establish a secondary market in student loans. In addition, a limited direct government loan program was established in 1993. These loan programs not only facilitate indebtedness, but also boost the scale of that indebtedness by encouraging steeper tuition increases. As Thomas Donlan recently wrote in <I>Barron's</I>, "The faculty and staff can vote themselves higher salaries and more resources if the only consequence is that students and parents just have to sign on the dotted line to borrow some more money."<SUP>8</SUP>  With federal debt assistance so readily available, schools have no incentive to control the costs of education.

<P>
<DD>
The increase in tuition costs because of increased demand and a rise in value is a natural market occurrence and should not be addressed by government involvement. Similarly, any overemphasis by universities on research will be corrected as students seek out schools focused on education. As for the fiscal restraint manifesting itself at the state level, it is the result of a decision by Americans who feel overtaxed. Therefore, federal policy should focus on correcting the remaining cause of escalating tuition: the effect of federal programs and their consequences for families.

<P>
<DD>
One side effect of any policy designed to make money more available to families to afford college will be to boost tuition somewhat. But the wisest approach would be to make it easier for families to save for college rather than to make it even easier for families and students to go deeply into debt.

<P>
<DD>
<B>The Uncertainty.</B> The second problem to address concerning the rising costs of higher education is not just that college costs a lot, but that the cost is uncertain, which makes it hard for families to know how much they must put aside, or what debt they or their children will have to incur to pay for a college education. Over the past decade alone, private college inflation, as measured by the Independent College 500 Index, has ranged from a low of 5.05 percent in 1996 to a high of 8.61 percent in 1989.<SUP>9</SUP>  Tuition at public universities has fluctuated just as much, from a high of 8.90 percent in 1986 to a low of 4.69 percent in 1994.<SUP>10</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
The uncertainty of college costs makes saving particularly difficult because parents can never be sure they are saving enough money to cover the full costs of tuition, fees, room, and board. Or families may save too much for higher education costs, in which case they will be sacrificing savings for other expenses such as retirement or a house. The uncertainty surrounding saving for college is like taking out a mortgage without knowing what the final price of the house will be when the closing date arrives.

<P>
<DD>
To understand how much fluctuations in tuition rates can mean when planning financially for college, consider again the young couple who want to save for their newborn child's education. If tuition and fees at a private university were to rise at the 1994 rate of 4.69 percent, the couple would have to save $47,320 in today's dollars. If tuition and fees at the same school were to rise at the 1986 rate of 8.90 percent, the couple would have to save $102,407 in today's dollars.<SUP>11</SUP>  It is impossible to plan efficiently for expected college costs under such uncertain conditions.

<P>
<B>EXAMINING SOME CURRENT ALTERNATIVES</B>

<P>
<DD>
<B>The beginning of a solution.</B> Several states and private interests have begun to address the problems of escalating tuition costs and the uncertainty of those costs by offering savings plans for parents with young children. Although details differ from plan to plan, the state plans generally have two core characteristics. First, parents can save money for their children's education without paying state income tax on the interest. And second, parents may purchase an amount of higher education at today's tuition rates to be redeemed in the future when their children enter college. As Peter Mezereas, Executive Director of the Massachusetts plan, explains, "These plans are a way to lock in tomorrow's tuition at today's rates."<SUP>12</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
The first of these state savings plans was established by Michigan in 1986. Florida and Ohio followed in 1988 and 1989, respectively. Today, 42 states either have implemented some form of tax-favored education savings plan or are studying the feasibility of such a program. These programs range from simple savings trust funds that allow parents to save whatever amount they wish, without having to pay state income taxes on the earnings, to complex pre-paid tuition plans that allow parents to purchase a semester of education at a school within the state at a specific date in the future. The accompanying <A HREF="bg1101m1.gif">map</A> and <A HREF="bg1101t1.gif">table</A> highlight the activities of the states.<SUP>13</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
<B>The advent of private savings plans.</B> States are not the only entities creating innovative savings programs for parents and future students. Private savings instruments have developed as well. For example, the College Savings Bank of Princeton, New Jersey, offers the CollegeSure Certificate of Deposit (CD), a federally insured savings vehicle whose rate of return is tied to an index of the tuition inflation at 500 public and private colleges and universities. The CollegeSure CD is more flexible than the state plans because the savings can be used at any school in the United States and can be applied toward tuition, room, board, or any other cost associated with a student's education. If the beneficiary decides not to attend college, the money can be withdrawn without losing interest income.<SUP>14</SUP>  Because it is indexed, the purchaser knows the investment will cover average increases in college costs -- though it does not lock in a specific amount of education at any particular institution.

<P>
<DD>
The plan offered by the College Savings Bank does have drawbacks, however, largely due to state and federal law. Most important, interest earned on the CD is fully taxable at both the state and federal levels, and the profits of the bank are also taxed at both the state and federal levels. To cover these four taxes and plan for a semester of college costs ten years in the future, parents have to invest more than that semester actually costs in present dollars. For example, if a semester at a particular university currently costs $2,012, then an investor with the College Savings Bank must deposit $2,318 today to cover fully the expenses of a semester ten years from now as well as the taxes paid by the bank at the state and federal levels. In addition, the investing family must consider that they will be responsible for paying personal taxes on the interest they earn. In this example, the principal will increase from $2,318 to $3,848, thus earning $1,530 in interest. While the family is guranteed a rate of return tied to future tuition costs, it is at a premium to cover all the applicable taxes.<SUP>15</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
<B>Recent action by Congress.</B> Last year, the 104th Congress and President Clinton made the state savings programs even more attractive by deferring federal income taxes on the interest earned by investors. This provision was passed as part of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (H.R. 3448, P.L. 104-188). It was proposed originally by Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) in S. 386 and was supported strongly by Senator Bob Graham (D-FL). Moreover, at the time the plan is cashed in, the accrued interest income is taxed at the child's tax rate, which is usually less than the tax rate faced by parents. Since passage of this special tax treatment, many more states have chosen to consider or implement tuition savings plans; more than 15 states have announced plans to study the feasibility of establishing such tuition plans.

<P>
<DD>
Unfortunately, Congress and the President did not extend this preferential tax treatment to similar private education savings plans such as those offered by the College Savings Bank. This has placed these private investments at a distinct disadvantage compared to state-sponsored plans, because investors in the private plans must continue to pay taxes on the annual earnings of their savings.

<P>
<B>TAKING EFFECTIVE CONGRESSIONAL ACTION</B>

<P>
<DD>
Existing state savings programs have enabled thousands of families to overcome the high costs and uncertainty of college tuition. However, much remains to be done to extend these benefits to all families and all institutions of higher education -- public and private alike. Several additional reforms would make the state and private savings plans even more attractive to parents who are trying to save for their children's higher education and who are looking for predictability in tuition costs. Specifically, Congress and the President should adopt the following strategies:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Strategy #1: Make investments in all state savings programs completely tax-free.</B><SUP>16</SUP>  The legislation passed last year by Congress and signed by the President makes the state-based plans tax-advantaged compared to other savings options; however, there is still room for improvement. All earnings from the savings plans purchased with after-tax dollars should be completely tax-free. For plans that invest in equities and private bonds, this would eliminate the inequitable double taxation that currently exists.<SUP>17</SUP>  For the plans that are financed by a state's general obligation fund, tax-free status would place education savings bonds on a par with other general government bonds. Eliminating all federal income taxes on the imputed interest earned through the state programs also would create an additional incentive for savings which would help fuel greater economic growth.

<P>
<DD>
The most comprehensive way to eliminate all taxes on interest earned on the state prepaid tuition bonds would be to adopt the proposal of Senator William Roth (R-DE) for a super IRA. This proposal would allow parents to invest money in their individual retirement account (IRA) that can then be withdrawn tax-free for certain expenses, such as a first-time home purchase, major medical expenses, and higher education costs. Classifying the existing state-based prepaid tuition plans as qualified IRAs would preserve the unique characteristics of the various programs while extending fair tax treatment to all investors in education savings plans.

<P>
<DD>
Short of this, Congress should allow interest income earned from the existing private and state savings plans (and income earned from any higher education bonds that are issued by private investors or colleges) to be deductible from federal income taxes. This could be accomplished simply by deducting interest income from taxable income.
<P>
<B>Strategy #2: Extend tax-free status to private education savings programs.</B><SUP>18</SUP>  Many innovative private savings plans are available to parents who want to save for their children's education. However, none of these plans currently qualifies for any special tax treatment. Therefore, they are at a disadvantage compared with current state plans which are free of state taxes and tax-deferred at the federal level. This disadvantage should be corrected by allowing tax-free investment in private as well as state programs. The same rationale for tax-free status applies to private plans as well as state plans. Tax-free status would eliminate double taxation and provide incentives for personal saving.

<P>
<DD>
Private programs also offer several advantages to families when compared with state programs. They are not limited to schools within a specific state; therefore, parents can save for their children's education without locking themselves into a limited number of institutions. Private plans also offer the innovation of the private market. Although only a handful of private plans currently exist, there is no reason why more companies could not offer innovative products if they are given the same tax treatment as state-sponsored plans. Any increase in competition among providers can only benefit families by allowing them a greater selection of products with which to save for college.
<P>
<B>Strategy #3: Direct the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to sanction a private "futures" market for education savings bonds.</B> Although the federal government should not take an active role in the creation of a private futures market for education bonds, it also should not stand in the way of such a development. A futures market would be a valuable addition to "locked in" plans by introducing greater flexibility and sophistication.

<P>
<DD>
<B>Benefits to parents.</B> In a futures market, independent investors or schools would offer bonds denominated in educational units (semesters or credit hours, for example) at particular schools. Parents could purchase the bonds for the year in which their child was expected to enter college. But there would be an additional choice -- for a small price. A parent could buy a "call" option at a small price for the <I>right</I> to buy a bond at a later time at a fixed price. That time might be when the family could expect a higher income, or when the parents sold their house and became "empty nesters."  As with any other futures market, parents essentially would be locking in a future price without paying for the product today.

<P>
<DD>
Not only would this guarantee to parents that their savings would be sufficient to pay for the educational needs of their children at a particular college, but a family could trade one bond for another bond good at a different college if the family's means or desires changed. In other words, a market would develop in which investors who hold a bond for one school could trade the bond with other investors who hold bonds redeemable at another school. For example, if Mr. Jones has purchased a bond for one semester at Harvard University but his daughter decides to attend the University of Notre Dame, he could trade the Harvard bond on the futures market with Mr. Smith who previously purchased a bond redeemable at Notre Dame, and the difference in value would be made up in cash.

<P>
<DD>
<B>Benefits to bond issuers.</B> Private issuers of education bonds would benefit from a stronger market because they could reinvest the savings and earn a higher rate of return than would be necessary to cover the cost of tuition even in the future. Again, the principle is exactly the same as with any other futures market or mutual fund. The issuer of the bond guarantees to pay to the purchaser the cost of tuition in the future. Any income earned on investing the money above that level is reserved for the issuer. As long as the actual rate of return is higher than the future cost of education, the transaction is profitable for the investor and the purchaser of the bond is guaranteed to meet his goal of covering the expenses of higher education. To protect consumers against fraud, these private bonds would be covered by the same rules and regulations covering all other futures contracts.

<P>
<DD>
If schools themselves were the issuers of the education bonds, which is a likely development, they would also benefit. By issuing bonds, schools could raise money to build additional classrooms, upgrade computer systems, or pay for any number of other capital-intensive projects. Issuing bonds would be an attractive offer to schools that otherwise would have to borrow money from a bank or solicit private donations. The bondholders also would represent a pool of potential future students.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>HELPING FAMILIES WHO NEED IT</B>

<P>
<DD>
Historical participation patterns indicate that the primary beneficiaries of the state and private plans are working, middle-income American families. For example, the average annual income of families participating in the Florida higher education savings program -- the largest of the state-based prepaid tuition plans, with 316,000 active contracts -- is $50,000.

<P>
<DD>
Most of the state plans have options for families with limited incomes. The Florida program, for example, offers Community College contracts for as little as $11 per month. And a joint private-public program known as the Florida S.T.A.R.S. program offers free prepaid tuition contracts to exemplary students from low-income families. Kentucky has a lower limit of only $25 annually on the amount of money that can be saved by parents in their education savings fund. The average monthly savings in Kentucky is a mere $48 dollars per year. The private College Savings Bank requires a minimum investment of only $1,000 per year ($83 per month, payable in quarterly installments). The key to all of the programs is that they allow parents <I>of all income levels</I> to save at least a portion of their income for their children's education.

<P>
<DD>
A private bond and futures market would give families with modest incomes greater flexibility to finance the high cost of many private colleges. For example, young couples may purchase a "call option" on education bonds that would lock in current college tuition rates while deferring the actual purchase of the bond until such time as the couple's income has increased and they can afford to purchase the bond outright or begin to make installment payments.

<P>
<DD>
Alternatively, families would be able to purchase higher education for their children one piece at a time. This is one of the many advantages of the existing state-sponsored prepaid tuition plans: Parents can purchase one semester or any number of credit hours each year until they have accumulated a full education. However, the existing plans are limited to in-state schools, and more often to in-state <I>public</I> schools. A private bond market would allow families -- even those of limited means -- to purchase pieces of education at any institute of higher education in the country, including private universities. Moreover, because these bonds would be tradable, parents would not be restricted to a specific school or state school system. The uncertainty of tuition inflation would be eliminated because rates would be locked in; private schools would be more accessible for all families because private bonds would not be limited to in-state schools; and flexibility would be introduced because the bonds would be tradable.

<P>
<B>THE EFFECT ON FEDERAL GRANT AND LOAN PROGRAMS</B>

<P>
<DD>
The goal of all the education savings plans -- both state and privately operated plans -- is to increase savings for college. Since there are only three ways to pay for college (save, work, or borrow), any increase in savings will likely result in a decrease in work or borrowing. Therefore, a decrease in student loans and decreased participation in work/study programs would be expected. However, this is a desirable outcome. The more parents and students are paying in advance for their education and the less they get into debt, the better.

<P>
<DD>
Moreover, an increase in family savings would mean that existing federal grant programs can be better targeted to the truly needy. During the 1995-1996 school year, 46 percent of students from families with incomes between $30,000 and $39,999 received Pell Grants worth an average of $1,060 each. The state and private savings programs are most attractive to families in this income range. Thus, as middle-class families save more, federal grants could be redirected to those who are most in need (i.e., those who cannot afford to save even a small amount of money).

<P>
<DD>
It is true that, under current law, many families who save money for higher education costs are penalized in the federal grant process. This is because any money saved by the family is counted as income and can offset federal grant money dollar for dollar. This is also true of the tax credit and deduction proposed by President Clinton. In fact, Lawrence Gladieux and Robert Reischauer reported that "nearly 4 million low-income students would largely be excluded from the tax credit because they receive Pell Grants which, under the Clinton plan, would be subtracted from their tax-credit eligibility."<SUP>19</SUP>  However, this is a deficiency of the federal grant programs, not an argument against college savings programs. Federal grants that discourage independent saving promote dependency on the government and lead to all the correlated problems. These programs should be reevaluated this year during reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, not held up as a red herring to stop progress toward enactment of education savings plans.

<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>

<P>
<DD>
The return on a college education is sufficiently valuable that, given the opportunity, parents undoubtedly will save for their children's education. The question is whether they can. Today, families face steeper taxes than at any other time in history; since 1940, the total tax burden faced by the average family has increased from 5 cents to more than 40 cents for each dollar earned. Moreover, college tuition costs are higher than ever, and the rapid rate of tuition inflation has been fueled by federal government programs that are nothing more than a free pot of money at the end of the rainbow for colleges and universities.

<P>
<DD>Fortunately, several states and a handful of private companies have developed innovative programs that facilitate family saving for college. These efforts should be encouraged and expanded. Congress and the President can do this by taking steps to make all of the earnings from all of the state and private plans tax-free. This approach would eliminate the double taxation investors now face. It would encourage families to save for college rather than force them to strap themselves with debt and their children with years of student loan payments.

</ol>
<p>
<a name="1">
<dd>
1) During his Tuesday press conference President Clinton got
some pretty tough questions about his fundraising and all the
networks aired evening news stories on his admission that
"mistakes were made." But not from everyone took an adversarial
approach. Two network reporters portrayed Clinton as the victim.
<p>
<dd>
Newly-installed ABC News White House reporter John Donvan
asked Clinton: 
<br>
<dd>
"Mr. President, in your Inaugural address eight days ago you
outlined some quite lofty goals -- for example, the education
proposals you were speaking about today. But in the days since,
many questions in the press and in Congress have focused on issues
like campaign fundraising. My question is whether you are worried
that the well is being poisoned even now for the realization of
these goals before you can get out of the gate, particularly on
the issue of bipartisanship?"
<p>
<dd>
After the press conference CNN anchor Judy Woodruff demanded
of Senator Phil Gramm why the Republicans were so unforgiving:
<br>
<dd>
"Senator, you said that you don't think there's any comparison
in any other administration with what happened at this White
House...And yet the President acknowledged mistakes were made. He
said either deliberately or inadvertently. He said we're going to
find out. He said we're going to find out exactly which it was.
How much more does the President need to say, to apologize, to say
he wants to clear the air or however you want to put it?"
<p>
<dd>
CNN's Candy Crowley posed a couple of questions before
Woodruff made this query right out of the Democratic Party
talking points booklet:
<br>
<dd>
"Senator Gramm, just one other question. How important is it
do you think that Senator Thompson's committee look equally or
proportionately into what may have been Republican excesses in
campaign financing as well as those on the Democratic side?"
<p>
<a name="2">
<dd>
2) What "chilling effect"? Last week reporters worried that
the Food Lion decision would lead media bosses to pull back from
hard-hitting investigative stories on big companies. But
Wednesday's (January 29) CBS Evening News ran a piece on the
supposed misdeeds of a Food Lion competitor: the Albertsons
grocery store chain. And like ABC's Food Lion report it appeared
to rely on charges promoted by the United Food and Commercial
Workers union.
<br>
<dd>
Dan Rather introduced the story with a bit of hyperbole for
dramatic effect:
<br>
<dd>
"In tonight's Eye on America, a behind the scenes, under the
surface investigation. We looked into allegations of a type of job
abuse that's rarely talked about. It may cheat working people out
of untold millions of dollars. These are said to be workers who
produce for and serve the American public but are not hidden away
in sweat shops overseas. Sandra Hughes looked into allegations
about the nation's fourth largest supermarket chain."
<br>
<dd>
Sandra Hughes began: "Some two thousand hourly employees claim
Albertsons grocery stores are ringing up the profits at their
expense. They say for years the company has been forcing them to
work after hours with no pay. That's why John Lee submitted this
letter of resignation..."
<br>
<dd>
After a soundbite from Lee and another employee who was afraid
of being fired, Hughes noted: "Joe Peterson of the food worker's
union is compiling a growing list of complaints."
<br>
<dd>
Hughes then talked to another employee who explained how the
company duty lists contained more duties than could be
accomplished in a shift. Hughes allowed an Albertsons spokesman to
say the charges are a union organizing tactic, before concluding
with a former employee who insisted short-changing employees was
company policy.
<p>
<dd>
As a salaried employee I'm not sure how much sympathy I should
have for those not paid more for working a few extra hours. But
however wrong it is to not fully pay hourly wage earners,
comparing their plight to "sweat shops overseas" is just the kind
of hype that's leading the public to mistrust the media.
<p>
<a name="3">
<dd>
3) Bryant Gumbel just may stay with NBC after all. Peter
Johnson reported in the January 29 USA Today that while Gumbel had
been expected to jump to ABC or CBS, "General Electric Chairman
Jack Welch has intervened, kept Gumbel on NBC's payroll and
ordered execs to make every effort to keep him. A couple of weeks
ago Welch flew Gumbel to Seattle to meet Microsoft's Bill Gates
and tour MSNBC's Microsoft-run operation in Washington State.
<br>
<dd>
Johnson discovered: "Word is that NBC has offered Gumbel a
laundry list of high-profile duties, along with a yearly salary
well into seven figures. Discussed: Gumbel hosting NBC's National
Geographic specials five times a year, anchoring Dateline NBC one
day a week, developing a syndicated show for NBC's local stations
and having some MSNBC duties."
<br>
<dd>
Gumbel will play in a golf tournament this weekend and next
week, Johnson noted, he will meet "again with ABC News chief Roone
Arledge and CBS News President Andrew Heyward, to see what they've
cooked up for him."
<p>
<dd>
The next time you hear someone arguing the networks are
controlled by wealthy, conservative businessmen, remember this
effort by Jack Welch to maximize the visibility of arguably the
most liberal network star. 
<p>
<a name="4">
<dd>
4) An item in Wednesday's Washington Post "Reliable Source"
gossip column, by Annie Groer and Ann Gerhart, began: "Look what
Great Society warrior is speaking before the ultra-right Heritage
Foundation today: Joseph Califano..."
<p>
<dd>
How far left must you be to consider a conservative group like
Heritage, which tried to silence critics from the right of George
Bush in its ranks, an "ultra-right" group?

<h2>Doctor, Can I Have This Agency Removed?</h2>
<b>By Jessica Gavora</b>

<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
<dd>
Six years ago, during the buildup to the Persian Gulf War, the deployment of military medical personnel threatened to create shortages of medical professionals in some parts of the country. No problem: the U.S. Government was, at least in theory, ready. This was precisely the sort of situation for which the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service -- a federally funded corps of medical shock troops -- was created.	


<p>
<dd> In fact, the agency had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Defense in 1988 for just such a contingency. It explicitly stated that Corps members could be called upon to relieve shortages caused by military deployments in wartime.<p>
<table width="195" valign=top align=right cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">

<h3>Our uniformed corps of medical personnel is costly, unnecessary -- and reluctant to serve its country.</h3>
</FONT>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=center>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
<dd>	So when duty and country called, what did these highly paid, generously pensioned medical personnel do while other doctors and nurses mobilized for the front lines? They marched before Congress to demand that the Corps not be deployed. The Department of Defense, the Corps contended, should exhaust all possible options -- including recruiting civilian volunteers -- before asking the Corps to serve. And so the call-up never came.<p><b>Mission Implausible</b>
<p>
<dd>	Like the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines, the Commissioned Corps is a uniformed service of the United States. But unlike the armed services, the members of the PHSCC are not soldiers but doctors, nurses, even dietitians and veterinarians. Originally designed to provide the nation with a mobile, readily deployable cadre of medical personnel, over the years the PHSCC has drifted far from its mission. Today, no one is sure what it's supposed to do, but there is growing agreement on this: What it does, it does too expensively, and probably shouldn't be doing at all.	
<p>
<dd>Remember James Felsen, the Styrofoam cup bureaucrat? A Commissioned Corps officer, Felsen was made infamous last summer by the Washington Post as a bureaucrat paid $117,000 a year to pass the time reading newspapers, telephoning friends, and constructing an arch of used Styrofoam coffee cups in his office at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). By his own reckoning, he did "virtually nothing" -- and got an annual $15,000 "valuable employee" retention bonus in return.	
<p>
<dd>If the glare of the media spotlight has been unwelcome for Felsen, it has been doubly so for his boss -- the Surgeon General of the United States.  The Surgeon General is the highest-ranking and most prominent member of the Corps. Although the office has remained vacant for more than a year and a half, little attention has been paid to the 200-year-old, $600-million-a-year program over which he presides. 	
<p>
<dd>The Commissioned Corps traces its roots to 1789 and the federal government's first entry into the field of health care under President John Adams. Adams created a series of government-funded hospitals to care for merchant seaman who showed up, broke and sick with scurvy, in strange ports. The Marine Hospital Service later broadened its mission and became the Public Health Service (PHS). In 1889, Congress created the Commissioned Corps as a mobile cadre of medical professionals within the PHS with military rank, pay, allowances, and benefits. 	
<p>
<dd>The Corps justified its quasi-military status -- and benefits -- on the grounds that it would go anywhere and do anything to respond to medical emergencies. And through the end of World War II, the Corps fulfilled its mission. It battled smallpox, typhus, and yellow fever outbreaks at the turn of the century and served alongside the armed services in both world wars. 	
<p>
<dd>But the history of the Corps since the New Deal is considerably less heroic, recorded in the rapidly proliferating acronyms of an expanding health-care bureaucracy. Today its 6,276 members are significantly less mobile, "seeded" throughout the federal government -- at NIH, the Indian Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control, even the Environmental Protection Agency -- and are virtually indistinguishable from the 40,000 civilian Public Health Service employees with whom they work.<p><b>Dollars for Doctors</b>	

<p>
<dd>Virtually indistinguishable, that is, but for one thing: they are more expensive. The General Accounting Office (GAO) has found that the taxpayers could save as much as $130 million a year -- or 22 percent of the program's cost -- by replacing it with civilians. Although the wage disparity between Corps members and PHS civilians has varied over the years, the difference in salary can be as high as $10,000 to $30,000. Corps members also qualify for a host of military and veterans' benefits, and they and their dependents receive free health care. After 30 years, they can retire at 75 percent of their base pay.
<p>

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=center>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>	
<p>
<dd>All of which might be justified if the Corps were providing a unique and valuable service. In fact, the GAO has found that civilians could easily replace Corps members without causing a ripple in the flow of public health services. The PHS already has more than 19,000 civilians performing the same duties as Corps officers. Officials at three government agencies that together employ more than 1,000 Corps members told the GAO that civilians could replace Corps members in every case.	
<p>
<dd>The story of why they have not is a case study in bureaucratic survival techniques. The Corps has burrowed deep into the federal bureaucracy, keeping its profile low and its costs hidden in the federal budget. In short, it owes its existence to the same combination of public ignorance and bureaucratic self-interest that allowed James Felsen to spend three years building a polystyrene bridge to nowhere in his office in the suburbs of Washington. 	
<p>
<dd>Like other programs that have outlived their missions, the PHSCC benefits from its anonymity. Unlike most federal programs, there is no line in the budget that shows how much is appropriated each year for the Commissioned Corps. Each agency that hosts Corps members finds money in its own budget to pay their salaries. But they are still a bargain, because the individual agencies do not pick up the retirement costs of Corps members -- resulting in an unfunded pension liability of almost $4 billion in 1994.<p><b>No Accountability</b>

<p>
<dd>	The real secret to the longevity of the PHSCC, however, is its refusal to establish standards by which taxpayers can judge its performance. Despite its origins in the pomp and circumstance of the military -- with uniforms and insignia all its own -- the contemporary Corps has refused to allow itself to be defined by anything more than the basket of benefits that its member "officers" enjoy. 	
<p>
<dd>C. Everett Koop, the Surgeon General under President Reagan, came into office determined to restore some of the faded military luster of the Commissioned Corps. But when Koop suggested in 1987 that Corps members wear their uniforms more often, howls of protest went up at the federal health agencies, particularly the NIH. Some PHSCC physicians, it turns out, had joined the Corps during the Vietnam War as an alternative to military service. By the 1980s, they occupied senior research positions at the NIH and made it clear to Koop that they regarded their Corps uniforms as a "routinized expression of loyalty" that would stifle their creativity. "I regard this as an academic institution," an NIH laboratory chief told Science magazine. "Uniforms create a distinction that is detrimental and divisive." Sniffed another NIH physician, "I am not here because of the Corps, but in spite of it." Dissent was so great that Koop eventually backed down.	
<p>
<dd>And so it has fallen to James Felsen to push this elusive federal program back into the sunshine of public review. What happens next is anybody's guess, but the omens are not good. After the Post blew the whistle on Felsen, the government convened a retirement board to see if he could be forced out of public service. It determined he couldn't, and so he was given a new job at the CDC. He expects to receive his old salary and carry the title "senior program management officer consultant."

<h2>A Job Tree Grows in Brooklyn</h2>
<b>By Barbara von der Heydt</b>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
<dd>
One of the most controversial provisions of last year's welfare reform is the denial of government social services to legal immigrants who aren't citizens. The new law bars noncitizens from receiving food stamps until they become citizens or have worked in America for at least 10 years. In the future, legal immigrants will be denied most benefits and social services during their first five years of residence. These provisions reflect a new consensus on immigration policy: America should be open to foreigners who come here for an opportunity to work, not for welfare. But critics say that denying social services will hurt the communities where immigrants live.

<p>
<dd>	A job-training program run by a Catholic priest in Brooklyn shows how private programs can equip immigrants to become self-sufficient. Called Resources, the program takes English-illiterate immigrants from China, El Salvador, and the former Soviet Republics, as well as refugees from Haiti and elsewhere, and turns them into successful, English-speaking chefs, professional cleaners, and graphic designers. The program's success in training and placing immigrants in well-paying jobs -- all without government assistance -- could help shift the immigration debate from the language of exclusion to that of empowerment. <P><b>Modern-Day Sweatshops</b>
<p>
<dd>	It all started with a wrong turn. Father Ronald T. Marino worked for 15 years at the Catholic Migration Office in New York, but had never confronted the problem of immigrant employment. On a sweltering day in July 1994, however, he found he couldn't avoid it. While scouting for used office furniture in a building on Brooklyn's 65th Street, Marino stumbled upon a room overflowing with perhaps 150 women and children, most of them Chinese. They were sewing, and all the windows were painted over to hide their existence from outsiders.	
<p>
<dd>Marino demanded an explanation from the manager, seated in his air-conditioned office. He was promptly escorted to the door. Marino realized he had stumbled upon a nest of illegal immigrants working in a sweatshop. "The church has to do something about this," the Catholic priest recalls thinking. "At that moment, I started to get obsessed with the work issue for immigrants."	
<p>
<dd>Two years later, Marino directs one of the most innovative and successful job-training programs for immigrants in Brooklyn. His Resources program has helped about 100 men and women -- many with no work experience and no English-speaking ability -- to become literate and qualify for good-paying jobs. If the passport to economic independence is effective job-training, Marino is the sort of man you want stamping the papers: He trains immigrants in one of three nonprofit businesses owned by Resources. About 98 percent of his graduates are employed and off the welfare rolls. 	
<p>
<dd>Finding the right training formula took some undercover work. Marino posed as a man in search of a career change to see how government job-training programs worked. He found they were both costly and ineffective. Vocational schools taught some skills, but the participants were still virtually unemployable. The programs were rewarded with subsidies for keeping large numbers of participants in training, but not for placing them in jobs. Neither were they penalized for failing to make the trainees marketable.	
<p>
<dd>Marino told the <I>Washington Times</I>, "The people running the programs would say to me, off the record, that I as an American who could speak the language so well stood a pretty good chance of getting a job, but that these immigrants basically had no hope."
<p>
<dd>	The clergyman drafted a proposal for an employment training program and distributed 20 copies. Nineteen business people who received it said he was crazed. One copy went to his bishop, who encouraged him. That was enough.
<p>
<dd>	Marino went on a speaking tour in Italy, where he shared his vision with a group of Italian businessmen. In gratitude for what America has given Italian immigrants, the businessmen offered him $50,000 for the program, stipulating only that the money aid other nationalities as well. Marino launched Resources in 1994 with this seed money, and has since received no funds from either the government or the diocese, although both have been offered. The successful training program owns the businesses where its trainees work, and their work helps fund the program. It is now nearly self-supporting, grossing almost $500,000 in 1996.<p><b>Five Principles</b>

<p>
<dd>	The Resources concept has been honed to five tenets:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Require proficiency in English and provide instruction to those trainees who need it;<li> Teach a trade through both hands-on training and classroom instruction;<li> Strengthen the character of participants; teach the dignity of excellence in work;<li> Create companies to employ the trainees;<li> Help graduates gain clients within the community, ultimately launching them in their own businesses.	
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
<dd>
Besides its entrepreneurial focus, Resources is distinguished from other programs by its underlying philosophy. A summary graces the stairway to the group's offices: "The aim of work is not the work itself, but rather it is man." The words are those of Pope John Paul II, from the encyclical on "Human Work" (1980). They reflect the modern Catholic understanding that honest work -- whatever it may be -- has an ennobling effect on the human spirit. This is because work encourages the virtues of discipline, cooperation, honesty -- all essential to fostering the dignity of the worker.
<p>
<dd>	"I try to communicate an attitude toward work to the participants," says Michael A. Campo, a job trainer and manager with Resources. "The attitude is very important. Some think work is what you do for a wage, but it is far more. The feeling in the heart comes first before the technical procedures. If you put your heart into your work, and do whatever you do well, it's contagious."	
<p>
<dd>When Dave Ali arrived in America from Trinidad, he did not know how to turn on a computer. Now, after two and a half years in the program, he is a full-time assistant in computer graphics at Resources. "I'm very excited about it," he says. "I never knew I had any artistic talent, but they put a lot of effort into teaching me. Now I help other people discover their own ideas."	
<p>
<dd>Trainees are tested in their English ability, and are required to take remedial English until they demonstrate proficiency. As Marino explains, "If you're serious about living and working here, you have to be able to understand a supervisor's instructions in English." Trainees attend one of 30 English schools run by the Catholic Migration offices in Brooklyn and Queens.	
<p>
<dd>Once they learn enough English, immigrants get professional training in one of the three businesses run by Resources: commercial cleaning, computer graphics, or culinary arts. If they pick professional cleaning, they receive 100 hours of instruction. For graphics and culinary arts, students get three semesters of instruction totaling 300 hours. Then they receive on-the-job training through an apprenticeship.	
<p>
<dd>Participants pay $400 per semester, either in advance or from their salaries. This is not the make-work approach of many government job-training efforts. The clients of Resources Graphic Design have included Italian fashion designer Max Mara and Telesoft USA, a global telecommunications company. Professional Cleaning did more than $130,000 worth of business in its first year alone.<p><b>How It Works</b>

<p>
<dd>
	Here's the nuts and bolts: After completing the training and apprenticeship, worker get a company uniform and joins a supervised team at a work site, earning from $7 to $10 per hour. At the end of the first year, these workers are invited back to be trained as supervisors making at least $10 an hour. Supervisors are taught to manage a crew, handle employee problems, order supplies, and deal effectively with customers. Each such promotion frees up a work space for a newly graduated student.
<p>
<dd>	Supervisors can then be trained as managers, who are responsible for bidding on new contracts, ascertaining the needs of customers, obtaining machinery and chemicals, and dispensing work crews. In the final step, Resources will invite a small group of competent managers to form their own small business and award them two Resources contracts to get started.	
<p>
<dd>Students of culinary arts are given 200 hours of sophisticated instruction. Then they are ready to apprentice in a real restaurant. Restaurateurs are each asked to contribute $1,000 toward a scholarship for a student; in return, they receive that student's services for a semester. In this way the student learns on-site from a professional chef. Many are offered a permanent position with their sponsor after graduation. All of the students who have graduated from the culinary-arts program are now gainfully employed.	
<p>
<dd>The Resources program effectively combines job training with job creation: Most of its graduates work  in businesses owned by Resources. The local business community and Catholic parishes and schools in the diocese are regular clients for cleaning and graphics services. Local businesses and printing shops that cannot afford in-house graphics staff also contract with Resources, as do parishes and schools. Churches in need of cleaning but short on staff and cash have found a godsend. Catering is the next planned expansion.<p><b>An Alternative to Welfare</b>

<p>
<dd>	Marino's concept was designed to help immigrants, but it could address a bigger problem -- the welfare caseload. The basic strengths of the model -- teaching not only marketable skills but also the inherent value of work and vocation -- are in urgent demand among welfare recipients. As the work requirements of welfare reform take effect, politicians will be especially anxious to create jobs and job-training programs. They had better start looking at what works.	
<p>
<dd>Marino likes to reflect on the purpose of work -- and of life -- and how his program helps to strengthen the character of immigrants and those who are working with them. Because poverty is a moral issue as well as an economic one, he believes, those who empower the needy to live in dignity and provide for their families reap spiritual fruits for themselves. "We are made in the image of Christ," Marino says. "In order for me to find my dignity, I need to help you find yours. If you serve Christ, you see Him in the person you serve. You discover your own dignity in seeing Him in others."

<title>IDEOLOGY OR PARTISANSHIP FOR THE GOP?</title>

<center><h2>IDEOLOGY OR PARTISANSHIP FOR THE GOP?</h2></center> 
<center><a href="/townhall/columnists/pascoe.html"><i>Bill Pascoe</i></center></a>
<p>          
Ideology, or partisanship?  Which is more important for Republicans trying to win elections?  For those concerned with such deep thoughts, last Friday was a day to behold.  Within a span of just a few hours, three events occurred that signaled the supremacy of one vision and the failure of the other:  at the White House, Robert J. Dole was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom; on Capitol Hill, Speaker Newt Gingrich's ethics case was argued before the House Ethics Committee; and uptown, at the Renaissance Hotel, a new chairman of the Republican National Committee was elected to replace Haley Barbour.
<p>
These unrelated events highlighted the three different wings of the Republican Party -- the presidential wing, the congressional wing, and the state and local wing -- and their conflicting answers to the question stated above.  The presidential wing has taken the view in the last two elections that simple partisanship is enough, and has failed; the congressional and state and local wings have taken the view that ideology is paramount, and have achieved historic successes.
<p>
To begin, Mr. Dole's award.  Mr. Dole represents both the best and the worst of the Republican Party at the presidential level: the best, in that truly no man loves his country, and made more sacrifices for it, than he.  But at the same time, he represents the worst of the GOP: the stoic, harsh image; the near-obsession with balancing budgets at the cost of all else (even if it means increasing taxes on a regular basis); the fuzziness about ideology and Athe vision thing. 
<p>
Mr. Dole's Republican Party was a party that offered only a cheaper version of the Democratic vision of bigger government, and one that would be paid for as we go along, thank you very much.  It was a party that felt uncomfortable talking about the things that win elections -- the social issues.  And it was a party that lost the last two presidential elections.
<p>
On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, we were hearing the full charges against Mr. Gingrich.  While the controversy over whether or not he took liberties with arcane tax laws (and his resulting fine) will attract the most attention, what was most significant about Friday's hearing was the defense offered by his counsel, Randy Evans, who gave a detailed explanation of the difference between the Party and Athe [conservative] movement.
<p>
Critics of the Speaker, Mr. Evans stated, fundamentally misunderstand the nature of what the Speaker was doing in the early part of this decade.  They focus on what they believe to be the use of tax-exempt charitable organizations to further a partisan goal -- when in reality, he pointed out, it was precisely the other way around:  the Speaker intended to use partisan organizations to achieve the supremacy of the movement and its ideological vision.  Using charitable foundations was not a means to achieve a desired partisan end, to wit, Republican victory; rather, a Republican victory was the means to achieve the desired IDEOLOGICAL end, to wit, conservative dominance over the intellectual and political life of the nation.
<p>
This is not merely a semantic distinction, as it goes to the very core of the Republican Party's strength, and why it will remain strong so as long as -- AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH -- it is the political vehicle through which the conservative movement manifests its political power.
<p>
The validity of this statement can be seen in recent election returns: when the GOP put forth a presidential candidate with a conservative vision who ran an ideological campaign (as it did with Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984, and even George Bush in 1988), it won; when it put forth a presidential candidate with no conservative vision who failed to run an ideological campaign (as it did with Mr. Bush in 1992 and Mr. Dole in 1996), it lost.
<p>
Meanwhile, Republicans became the dominant party at the congressional and gubernatorial levels in the last two election cycles precisely by running ideological campaigns.  The result was the Republican capture of the Congress for the first time in four decades and a near-doubling of the number of Republican governors.
<p>
All of which brings us to the election of James Nicholson of Colorado to replace outgoing national chairman Haley Barbour.  Unlike Mr. Barbour's predecessor, Rich Bond -- who in his farewell address to the committee four years ago warned Republicans about the political Adangers' of the party's principled pro-life stand, and urged its removal from the party platform -- Mr. Barbour understood that by its nature the GOP is a conservative party, and that conservatives will walk away from the party, leaving it an army with many generals and no troops, should it ever abandon its conservative principles.
<p>
Mr. Nicholson, heretofore a little-known national committeeman from Colorado, owes his victory to conservatives on the national committee who blocked New Jersey committeeman David Norcross because he was perceived as too liberal, and former New Hampshire governor Steve Merrill because he was too closely associated with the failing, consultant-driven presidential wing of the party.  A Vietnam veteran who holds to strong pro-life views and backed conservative Texas Sen. Phil Gramm in the 1996 GOP presidential primaries, Mr. Nicholson assumes control of a party that's made extraordinary progress at the congressional and state levels, but needs to get back to a winning message and a winning messenger on the presidential level. 
<p>
By all indications, Mr. Nicholson is a man who understands that ideology, not partisanship, is and should be the key to winning elections.  Here's hoping he can use his influence to ensure that the next GOP presidential nominee comes from the ideological wing of the party.  If he can, he'll be remembered as the man who finished the job Mr. Barbour started.

<dd> Under the modern doctrine of judicial review, the federal judiciary can invalidate any state or federal law or policy it considers inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution. This doctrine gives unelected federal judges awesome power. Whenever these judges exceed their constitutional prerogative to interpret law and instead read their personal views and prejudices into the Constitution, the least democratic branch of government becomes its most powerful as well.<p>
<dd>	America's Founding Fathers created a democratic republic in which elected representatives were to decide the important issues of the day. In their view, the role of the judiciary, although crucial, was to interpret and clarify the law -- not to make law. The Framers recognized the necessity of judicial restraint and the dangers of judicial activism. James Madison wrote in <I>The Federalist Papers</I> that to combine judicial power with executive and legislative authority was "the very definition of tyranny," and Thomas Jefferson believed that allowing only the unelected judiciary to interpret the Constitution would lead to judicial supremacy. "It is a very dangerous doctrine to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions," said Jefferson. "It is one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy."

<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>The doctrine of judicial review gives unelected federal judges awesome power to usurp the democratic process.</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>	
<p>
<dd> 	Unfortunately, the federal judiciary has strayed far beyond its proper functions, in many ways validating Jefferson's warnings about judicial power. In no other democracy in the world do unelected judges decide as many vital political issues as they do in America. We will never return the federal government to its proper role in our society until we return the federal judiciary to its proper role in our government.<p>
<dd>	Supreme Court decisions based on the Constitution cannot be reversed or altered, except by a constitutional amendment. Such decisions are virtually immune from presidential vetoes or congressional legislation. Abraham Lincoln warned of this in his First Inaugural Address when he said: <p>
<dd>	"[T]he candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government, upon vital questions, affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court . . . the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having, to that extent, practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal."<p>
<dd>	When the most important social and moral issues are removed from the democratic process, citizens lose the political experience and moral education that come from resolving difficult issues and reaching a social consensus. President Reagan explained how judicial activism is incompatible with popular government:	
<p>
<dd>"The Founding Fathers were clear on this issue. For them, the question involved in judicial restraint was not  --  as it is not  --  will we have liberal courts or conservative courts? They knew that the courts, like the Constitution itself, must not be liberal or conservative. <I>The question was and is, will we have government by the people?</I>" [Emphasis added.]

<p><b>Judicial Excesses</b>

<p>
<dd> 	When federal judges exceed their proper interpretive role, the result is not only infidelity to the Constitution, but very often poor public policy. Numerous cases illustrate the consequences of judicial activism and the harm it has caused our society. Activist court decisions have undermined nearly every aspect of public policy. Among the most egregious examples: 
<p>
<table width="170" align="left" cellpadding="4"><tr>
<td>
<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>Federal judges have diverted our civil-rights laws from a color-blind ideal to a complex and unfair system of racial and ethnic preferences.</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>	
<p>
<dd> <b>Allowing racial preferences and quotas. </b> In <I>United Steelworkers of America v. Weber</I> (1979), the Supreme Court held for the first time that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 permits private employers to establish racial preferences and quotas in employment, despite the clear language of the statute: "It shall be an unlawful employment practice for any employer . . . to discriminate against any individual because of his race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." Had the Court decided Weber differently, racial preferences would not exist in the private sector today. The Weber decision is a classic example of how unelected government regulators and federal judges have diverted our civil-rights laws from a color-blind ideal to a complex and unfair system of racial and ethnic preferences and quotas that perpetuate bias and discrimination.<p>
<dd><b>Creating a "right" to public welfare assistance.</b> In <I>Goldberg v. Kelly</I> (1970), the Supreme Court sanctioned the idea that welfare entitlements are a form of "property" under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court's conclusion: Before a government can terminate benefits on the grounds that the recipient is not eligible, the recipient is entitled to an extensive and costly appeals process akin to a trial. Thanks to the Court, welfare recipients now have a "right" to receive benefits fraudulently throughout lengthy legal proceedings, and never have to reimburse the government if their ineligibility is confirmed. The decision has tied up thousands of welfare workers in judicial hearings and deprived the truly needy of benefits. By 1974, for example, New York City alone needed a staff of 3,000 to conduct <I>Goldberg</I> hearings.<p>
<dd><b>Hampering criminal prosecution.</b> In <I>Mapp v. Ohio</I> (1961), the Supreme Court began a revolution in criminal procedure by requiring state courts to exclude from criminal cases any evidence found during an "unreasonable" search or seizure. In so holding, the Court overruled a previous case, <I>Wolf v. Colorado</I> (1949), which had allowed each state to devise its own methods for deterring unreasonable searches and seizures. The Supreme Court in effect acted like a legislature rather than a judicial body. As a dissenting justice noted, the <I>Mapp</I> decision unjustifiably infringed upon the states' sovereign judicial systems and forced them to adopt a uniform, federal procedural remedy ill-suited to serve states with "their own peculiar problems in criminal law enforcement."<p>
<dd>	In fact, nothing in the Fourth Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution mentions the exclusion of evidence, nor does the legislative history of the Constitution indicate that the Framers intended to require such exclusion. Instead we ought to explore other means of deterring police misconduct without acquitting criminals, such as permitting civil lawsuits against reckless government officials and enforcing internal police sanctions against offending officers with fines and demotions.<p>
<dd>	Since <I>Mapp v. Ohio</I>, the exclusionary rule has had a devastating impact on law enforcement in America. One recent study estimated that 150,000 criminal cases, including 30,000 cases of violence, are dropped or dismissed every year because the exclusionary rule excluded valid, probative evidence needed for prosecution. 

<p>
<dd> 	<b>Lowering hiring standards for the U.S. workforce.</b> In <I>Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</I> (1971), a plaintiff challenged a company's requirement that job applicants possess a high-school diploma and pass a general aptitude test as a condition of employment. The lawsuit argued that because the diploma and test requirements disqualified a disproportionate number of minorities, those requirements were unlawful under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 unless shown to be related to the job in question.<p>
<dd>	The Court ruled that under the Act, employment requirements that disproportionately exclude minorities must be shown to be related to job performance, and it rejected the employer's argument that the diploma and testing requirements were implemented to improve the overall quality of its work force. Moreover, the Court held that "Congress has placed on the employer the burden of showing that any given requirement must have a manifest relationship to the employment in question."<p>
<dd>	In fact, the Act explicitly authorizes an employer to use aptitude tests like the one challenged in <I>Griggs</I>. This insidious court decision has lowered the quality of the U.S. workforce by making it difficult for employers to require high-school diplomas and other neutral job requirements. It also forced employers to adopt racial quotas in order to avoid the expense of defending hiring practices that happen to produce disparate outcomes for different ethnic groups.
<p>
<dd><b>"Discovering" a right to abortion.</b> In <I>Roe v. Wade</I> (1973), the Court considered the constitutionality of a Texas statute that prohibited abortion except to save the life of the mother. Although the Court acknowledged that the Constitution does not explicitly mention a right of privacy, it held that the Constitution protects rights "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty." The Court ruled that "the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision," and it struck down the Texas statute under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court then went on, in a blatantly legislative fashion, to proclaim a precise framework limiting the states' ability to regulate abortion procedures.
<p>
<dd>	The dissenting opinion in <I>Roe</I> pointed out that, in order to justify its ruling, the majority had to somehow "find" within the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was unknown to the drafters of the Amendment. When the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in 1868, there were at least 36 state or territorial laws limiting abortion, and the passage of the Amendment raised no questions at the time about the validity of those laws. "The only conclusion possible from this history," wrote the dissenting justices, "is that the Drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter." <p>
<dd>	One of the most pernicious aspects of the <I>Roe</I> decision is that it removed one of the most profound social and moral issues from the democratic process without any constitutional authority. For the first two centuries of America's existence, the abortion issue had been decided by state legislatures, with substantially less violence and conflict than has attended the issue since the <I>Roe</I> decision. <p>
<dd><b>Overturning state referenda.</b> In <I>Romer v. Evans</I> (1996), the U.S. Supreme Court actually negated a direct vote of the people. This case concerned an amendment to the Colorado constitution enacted in 1992 by a statewide referendum. "Amendment 2" prohibited the state or any political subdivisions therein from adopting any policy that grants homosexuals "any minority status, quota preference, protected status, or claim of discrimination." The Court ruled that the amendment was unconstitutional because it did not bear a "rational relationship" to a legitimate government purpose and thus violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<p>
<table width="190" align="right" cellpadding="4"><tr>
<td>
<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>The Supreme Court has desecrated the principle of self-government and appointed itself the arbiter of the nation's moral values</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>	

<p>
<dd>	The state of Colorado contended that this amendment protected freedom of association, particularly for landlords and employers who have religious objections to homosexuality, and that it only prohibited <I>preferential treatment</I> for homosexuals. But the Court rejected these arguments and offered its own interpretation of what motivated the citizens of Colorado, claiming that "laws of the kind now before us raise the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the class of persons affected."<p>
<dd>	The dissenting opinion argued that Amendment 2 denies equal treatment only in the sense that homosexuals may not obtain "preferential treatment without amending the state constitution." Noting that under <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I> (1986), states are permitted to outlaw homosexual sodomy, the dissent reasoned that if it is constitutionally permissible for a state to criminalize homosexual conduct, it is surely constitutionally permissible for a state to deny special favor and protection to homosexuals. The Court's decision, the dissent charged, "is an act not of judicial judgment, but of political will."<p>
<dd>	It is hard not to regard the <I>Romer</I> decision as the pinnacle of judicial arrogance: Six appointed justices struck down a law passed by 54 percent of a state's voters in a direct election, the most democratic of all procedures. In one of the most egregious usurpations of power in constitutional history, the Court not only desecrated the principle of self-government, but appointed itself the moral arbiter of the nation's values.
<p><b>Turning the Tide</b>

<p>
<dd>	Fortunately, Congress has a number of strategies at its disposal to confine the judiciary to its proper constitutional role: 

<p>
<I><b><font size="+2">1.</font> The Senate should use its confirmation authority to block the appointment of activist federal judges. </b></I>
<p>
<dd> 	When a president appoints judges who exceed their constitutional authority and usurp the other branches of government, the Senate can properly restrain the judiciary by carefully exercising its responsibilities under the "advise and consent" clause of Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. 	
<p>
<dd> Normally, the Senate Judiciary Committee conducts a hearing on the president's nominees. Those nominees who are approved by the committee or submitted without recommendation go to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. 	
<p>
<dd> Unfortunately, the confirmation process in recent years has been relatively perfunctory. The Senate has been reluctant to closely question a nominee to ascertain the candidate's understanding of the proper role of the judiciary. The Senate committee hearing provides an excellent opportunity to discern a judicial candidate's understanding of a constitutionally limited judiciary. It also provides a public opportunity for judicial watchdog organizations to testify in support of or against a particular nominee.	
<p>
<dd> The Constitution established Senate confirmation to ensure that unqualified nominees were not given lifelong judgeships. In carrying out this important responsibility, senators should ascertain a prospective judge's commitment to a philosophy of judicial restraint and fidelity to the Constitution. In so doing, they should carefully review all the opinions, legal articles, and other materials authored by the candidate, the personal background report prepared by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the testimony of judges and other attorneys who have had ample opportunities to view a candidate's work.In the name of efficiency, the full Senate sometimes votes to confirm judicial nominees in bundles. This practice should cease. Senators should vote on each nominee individually, in order to remind the prospective judge and the public of the awesome responsibility of each new member of the judiciary and to hold themselves accountable for every judge they confirm to the federal bench.
<p>
<I><b><font size="+2">2.</font> Congress should strip the American Bar Association of its special role in the judicial selection process. </b></I><p>
<dd>	The American Bar Association (ABA) has shown itself to be a special-interest group, every bit as politicized as the American Civil Liberties Union or the National Rifle Association. In the 104th Congress, for example, the ABA officially supported federal funding for abortion services for the poor, racial and ethnic preferences, and a ban on assault weapons; and it opposed a ban a flag-burning, reform of the exclusionary rule and of death-penalty appeals, and a proposal to restrict AFDC payments for welfare mothers who have additional children. Hence it should be removed from any official role in evaluating judicial nominees. It would still be free to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee concerning potential judges, but it would not have any special status or authority.	
<p>
<dd> The Senate will always need the impartial assessment of judges and lawyers who have a detailed knowledge of the work and background of a judicial candidate. In place of the ABA, the Senate should appoint a special fact-finding committee in each of the 94 federal judicial districts. These lawyers would be selected for their objectivity, ideological neutrality, and understanding of the constitutional role of the judiciary. They would obtain the detailed information the Senate needs to evaluate a candidate, and would give that information directly to the Judiciary Committee without subjective comments or evaluation. <p><I><b><font size="+2">3.</font> Congress should exercise its power to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts.</b></I><p>
<dd>	Congress has great control over the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts. Article III, Section 1, of the Constitution provides that "[t]he judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, <I>and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish</I>." [Emphasis added.] It is well-established that since Congress has total discretion over whether to create the lower federal courts, it also has great discretion over the jurisdiction of those courts it chooses to create. In fact, Congress has in the past withdrawn jurisdiction from the lower federal courts when it became dissatisfied with their performance or concluded that state courts were the better forum for certain types of cases. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld Congress's power to do so. <p>
<dd>	Congress also has some authority to limit the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and to regulate its activities. Article III of the Constitution states that the Supreme Court "shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, <I>with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.</I>" [Emphasis added.] Although we recognize that the scope of Congress's power to regulate and restrict the Supreme Court's jurisdiction over particular types of cases is under debate, there is a constitutional basis for this authority.<p>
<dd>	In the only case that directly addressed this issue, the Supreme Court upheld Congress's power to restrict the Court's appellate jurisdiction. In <I>Ex Parte McCardle</I> (1869), the Court unanimously upheld Congress's power to limit its jurisdiction, stating:
<p>
<dd>	"We are not at liberty to inquire into the motives of the legislature. We can only examine into its power under the Constitution; <I>and the power to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of this court is given by express words</I>. What, then, is the effect of the repealing act upon the case before us? We cannot doubt as to this. Without jurisdiction, the court cannot proceed at all in any case." [Emphasis added.]

<p>
<dd>	Although some respected constitutional scholars argue that Congress cannot restrict the Supreme Court's jurisdiction to the extent that it intrudes upon the Court's "core functions," there is no question that Congress has more authority under the Constitution to act than it has recently exercised.The 104th Congress displayed an encouraging willingness to assert its authority over the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts. For example, the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 reduced the discretion of the federal courts to micromanage state prisons and to force the early release of prisoners. The Act also makes it more difficult for prisoners to file frivolous lawsuits. (An incredible 63,550 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal court in 1995 alone.) Congress also passed the Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995. This Act limited the power of the federal courts to entertain endless habeas corpus appeals filed by prisoners on death row, significantly expediting the death-penalty process. <p>
<dd>Other issues are due for some congressional muscle-flexing to restrain an activist judiciary:<p>
<table width="200" align="left" cellpadding="4"><tr>
<td>
<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>Congress should consider restricting the courts' jurisdiction over school choice, same-sex marriage, and other issues best left to the people.</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>	

<p>
<dd><b>Private-school choice.</b> Some radical groups like the American Civil Liberties Union argue that the government would violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause if it gave a tuition voucher to a family who uses it at a religious school. Under current Supreme Court precedents, school vouchers are almost certainly constitutional. Nevertheless, some federal judges have indicated that they would invalidate private-school choice plans under the Establishment Clause. Moreover, if more activist justices are named to the Supreme Court, a liberal majority could crush one of the most promising educational initiatives in recent years by judicial fiat. To ensure that the issue of private-school choice is decided through the democratic process, Congress should consider restricting the Court's jurisdiction over this issue.<p>
<dd><b>Judicial taxation.</b> "Judicial taxation" refers to federal court orders that require a state or local government to make significant expenditures to pay for court-ordered injunctions. For example, one federal judge ordered the state of Missouri to pay for approximately $2.6 billion in capital improvements and other costs to "desegregate" the school districts of St. Louis and Kansas City, which in recent years had lost many white students. To attract white students back into the system, a federal judge required Kansas City to maintain the most lavish schools in the nation, and actually ordered the city to raise property taxes to pay for his court-ordered remedies. <p>
<dd>	There's a name for tax increases imposed by appointed, life-tenured federal judges: taxation without representation. Under the Constitution, only Congress can lay and collect taxes; our Founding Fathers would be appalled at the thought of federal judges doing so. In <I>Federalist No. 48</I>, James Madison explained that in our democratic system, "the legislative branch alone has access to the pockets of the people." To codify this principle, Congress should consider restricting the federal courts' authority to order any government at any level to raise taxes under any circumstance.<p>
<dd><b>Use of special masters.</b> Federal judges sometimes appoint "special masters" to micromanage prisons, mental hospitals, and school districts. In the past, these special masters have been appointed to carry out the illegitimate excursions of judges into the province of the legislative and executive branches. Moreover, the use of special masters has been a form of taxation, in that state and local governments are required to pay their salaries and expenses -- which have often been extravagant. In some cases, special masters have hired large staffs to help execute the court order. Congress should outlaw special masters; without them, federal judges would be constrained by the limits on their time and resources from managing prisons or other institutions.<p>
<dd><b>Same-sex marriage.</b> No area of the law has been more firmly reserved to the states than domestic relations. Nevertheless, the Court's reasoning in <I>Romer v. Evans</I> suggests the possibility that some federal judges will "discover" a constitutional right to homosexual marriage, and thus remove the issue from the democratic process.<p>
<dd>	The Hawaii Supreme Court recently indicated that it would soon recognize homosexual marriages, which all other states would then have to recognize under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution (Article IV). This possibility motivated Congress to pass the Defense of Marriage Act, which authorized any state to refuse to recognize a same-sex marriage performed in another state. The Act does not, however, prevent the federal judiciary from usurping this issue. Congress should consider going one step further to remove the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts over same-sex marriages to ensure that this cultural issue is decided by the legislative process in each state.<P><I><b><font size="+2">4.</font> The states should press Congress to amend the Constitution in a way that will allow the states to ratify constitutional amendments in the future without the approval of Congress.</b></I>

<p>
<dd>	One reason judicial activism is so dangerous and undemocratic is that reversing or amending federal court decisions is so difficult. When a decision by the Supreme Court or a lower federal court is based on the Constitution, the decision cannot be reversed or altered except by a constitutional amendment. Such constitutional decisions are immune from presidential vetoes or congressional legislation.<table width="190" align="right" cellpadding="4"><tr>

<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>	
<p>
<dd>	The existing means of amending the Constitution, however, are seldom effective in halting judicial activism. The amendment procedure set forth in Article V of the Constitution is difficult and lengthy for good reason: to avoid hasty changes spurred by the passions of the moment. But history has shown that even the most egregious court decisions -- particularly those that affect the balance of power between the national government and the states -- have been impervious to correction by constitutional amendment. One reason for this is that Congress, which must initiate such amendments, is loath to give up federal power.	
<p>
<dd>The amendment procedure of the U.S. Constitution led Lord Bryce to conclude in his 1888 study, <I>The American Commonwealth</I>, that "[t]he Constitution which is the most difficult to change is that of the United States." This difficulty has encouraged judicial activism and allowed the unelected federal courts to "twist and shape" the Constitution, as Jefferson predicted, as an "artist shapes a ball of wax." The reason that the difficult amendment procedure encourages judicial activism is simple: Life-tenured judges are less likely to show restraint when the possibility that their rulings will be rejected is slight.

<p>
<dd>	Consequently, one strategy to rein in the federal judiciary is to revise the amendment procedure in Article V of the Constitution to allow the states to amend the Constitution without Congress's approval and without a constitutional convention.	
<p>
<dd>Here's how it would work: When two-thirds of state legislatures pass resolutions in support of a proposed amendment to the Constitution, Congress would have to submit it to all the states for ratification. The proposal would then become part of the Constitution once the legislatures of three-fourths of the states ratify it. Congress's role would be purely ministerial. This process would give the states equal power with Congress to initiate an amendment and would further check the power of the federal courts and of Congress. 

<p>
<I><b><font size=+"2">5.</font> Congress should stop the federalization of crime and the expansion of litigation in federal court. </b></I>

<p>
<dd>	Whenever Congress enacts a new federal criminal statute or a statute creating a cause-of-action in federal court, it enlarges the power and authority of the federal courts and provides more opportunities for judicial activism. At the same time, the federalization of crimes that have traditionally concerned state and local governments upsets the balance between the national government and the states. The following steps can help reduce the federalization of the law and once again restore balance to the federal-state relationship.	
<p>
<dd><b>Recodify the U.S. Code.</b> In the present federal criminal code, important offenses like treason are commingled with insignificant offenses like the unauthorized interstate transport of water hyacinths. The Federal Courts Study Committee found that the current federal code is "hard to find, hard to understand, redundant, and conflicting." Ideally, Congress would start with a blank slate, recodifying only those offenses that truly belong under federal jurisdiction. Due to the highly political nature of crime, such an undertaking might require the creation of an independent commission, modeled after the recent commission for closing unneeded military bases.<p>
<dd><b>Require a "federalism assessment" for legislation.</b> This idea would require that all federal legislation offer a justification for a national solution to the issue in question, acknowledge any efforts the states have taken to address the problem, explain the legislation's effect on state experimentation, and cite Congress's constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation. <p>
<dd><b>Create a federalism subcommittee within the judiciary committees of the House and Senate.</b> First proposed by President Reagan's Working Group on Federalism, federalism subcommittees would attempt to ensure compliance with federalism principles in all proposed legislation. <p>
<dd>	Judicial activism has harmed virtually every aspect of public policy in America. Liberalism has accomplished much of its agenda in the last 30 years not through the electoral process, but instead in the federal courts. Conservatives will never be able to shape public policy until they can curb activist judges. Congress can and should move to do so.<p>

<b>The Curious Case of Edward Luttwak</b><br>

George Gilder remarked some years back that one of the unforeseen costs of the defense conversion after the Cold War was that military theorists would start trying their hands at domestic policy, with dolorous consequences. He was speaking of Edward Luttwak, who's launched a second career in economic declinism. In the <I>Washington Post</I> over the weekend, he assailed what he called "Central Bankism"i.e., hostility to inflation. This "religion" forgets that deflation is just as bad as inflation, and leads to excessive unemployment. In fact, the evidence suggests that unemployment and inflation are positively correlated over the long run. And his point about deflationwhich he confuses with disinflationis the conventional wisdom of the very central bankers he attacks. What's most surprising about Luttwak's article, however, is what it suggests about the author's political trajectory. He calls the 1996 election "a contest between a far-Right candidate, Bob Dole, and a plain right-wing candidate, Bill Clinton." The mind boggles.

<P>
<DD>
Now that the 105th Congress has convened, new opportunities exist for Washington to reestablish America's global leadership in international trade.<SUP>1</SUP>  During the coming year, several key trade issues will be addressed. Among the most important will be fast-track trade negotiating authority, most favored nation (MFN) status for China, reducing trade barriers between members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Caribbean Basin nations, and bringing Chile into NAFTA. All of these issues directly affect America's long-term economic security and competitiveness.
<P>
<DD>
Even though these issues involve lowering barriers to U.S. exports and widening the market for American goods, however, some policymakers remain unconvinced of the practical benefits of free trade. The answer to their concern is simple: Free trade has enabled America to become the economic powerhouse that it is today. Continuing America's free trade tradition will allow U.S. citizens to become even wealthier in the future. It will also help developing countries become wealthier.

<P>
<B>THE BENEFITS OF FREE TRADE</B>

<P>
<DD>
U.S. trade represented a mere 9 percent of gross domestic product in 1960. Today, it accounts for 23 percent of GDP,<SUP>2</SUP> and some 12 million Americans owe their jobs to U.S. exports.<SUP>3</SUP>  Opportunities for overseas sales often affect a company's investment choices, hiring decisions, and research and development expenditures. Over the last three years, export of U.S. goods and services has risen by 20 percent -- about one-third of real GDP growth.
<P>
<DD>
Not only is the growth in American exports important, but so is the composition of the international marketplace in which this occurs. In 1970, for example, 29 percent of U.S. exports went to developing countries. Today, it is some 41 percent. This growth highlights the importance of U.S. trade and investment to the international economy in general, and to the less developed world more specifically. Because trade often is an engine of economic growth, if America fails to regain its leadership role in promoting free trade, the economies of less developed countries could stagnate, reducing the demand for U.S. exports and threatening America's long-term economic security.

<P>
<DD>
An open and competitive international marketplace promotes the economic prosperity of all countries engaged in trade. It does so by allowing businesses to be more competitive, by encouraging innovation, by spreading technological advances, and by increasing wealth. For example:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Free trade broadens the variety of "inputs" available to producers of goods.</B> More and more American companies are importing components and raw materials to manufacture their final products. In the computer industry, for example, American manufacturers of the world's most advanced computers import components like low-tech circuit boards to produce the higher-tech finished products. To produce or purchase all the components they need within the U.S., these companies would have to divert labor, capital, and other resources from the high-end, advanced processes involved in production of their finished goods.
<P>
<DD>
Free trade therefore maximizes a company's ability to produce better products by leaving the production of minor components to countries that do not have high-end manufacturing capabilities. This international division of labor has paid off in many high-tech industries. For example, America now produces more of the technology that makes up the worldwide Internet computer network, and more of the computer hardware needed to access it, than any other country. America also leads the world in the number of computer hosts accessing the Internet (see <A HREF="fyi127c1.gif">Chart 1</A>).
<P>
<LI><B>Free trade increases domestic competition, which in turn spurs innovation. </B>
Supporters of protectionism argue that foreign competition threatens U.S. jobs and the profitability of American firms. In most cases, however, competition forces companies to become more efficient and innovative. Indeed, it is the foundation of the free enterprise system. Without competition, companies are under no external pressure to build better and cheaper products, the innovative cycle breaks down, and companies become bloated and inefficient. In the end, consumers pay higher prices and have fewer good products from which to choose.

<P>
<DD>
The U.S. automobile industry is an example of how foreign competition has helped to propel American companies to world leadership. Despite years of trade protection, U.S. auto manufacturers have endured competition from Japanese and European auto manufacturers. This competition came not from imports; it came from Japanese and European plants located in the U.S. During the 1980s, as the Japanese were outproducing and outselling their American counterparts, Detroit responded by building better, higher quality cars. Not only are cars produced by these American companies now outselling many Japanese models, but they are becoming major U.S. exports.

<P>
<LI><B>Free trade maximizes comparative advantage and economies of scale.</B> No country can produce all the products that its citizens want to consume. Barriers to trade reduce the ability of companies to focus on the kinds of goods and services they produce best. For example, many Americans used to perform jobs like gluing soles onto tennis shoes or sewing labels onto sweaters; today, more and more Americans are employed producing products like supercomputers, semiconductors, and computer software. Free trade allows American companies to use the better educated and more productive U.S. workforce to produce goods and services of higher value.

<P>
<DD>
The U.S. today enjoys a virtual world monopoly in providing Internet services. A recent survey of the world's 50 largest Internet services companies, according to the industry magazine <I>Interactive Week</I>, found that all are American firms.<SUP>4</SUP>  This is due at least in part to the ability of America's labor force to focus on producing high-tech products.

<P>
<LI><B>Free trade quickens the flow of technology.</B> Most of the products made today by industrialized countries involve technology that did not even exist two decades ago. Much of this recent technology, however, was pioneered and developed outside of the U.S. No one country can produce all the technologies necessary for the development of new and innovative products. Free trade allows U.S. firms to enter into crucial partnerships with foreign firms. These partnerships, called strategic alliances, allow American companies to gain access to, and to benefit from, the new manufacturing, marketing, and distributing techniques that are being developed overseas. These new techniques can then be used to produce new products in the U.S.<SUP>5</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
In the late 1980s, for example, Japan had achieved a commanding lead in the production of circuitry for such products as laptop computers. American firms responded by seeking partnerships with various Japanese firms involved in that production. As a result, those American firms gained firsthand experience in the production of faster and smaller electronic components. This development helped save the U.S. semiconductor industry from bankruptcy.

<P>
<LI><B>Free trade increases the size of markets.</B> Free trade allows American firms to sell their goods to a larger market instead of just within the U.S. Thus, as demand for U.S. products overseas increases, so does American production needed to meet this demand. This allows American firms to hire more workers, pay higher wages, and invest more money in research and development of new products. Trade barriers overseas affect U.S. firms in the same way shutting the doors to the California market would affect a firm in New York. Free trade expands an American company's market, and this in turn expands sales and provides increased capital for that company's future production needs.

<P>
<LI><B>Free trade appears to produce global economic prosperity.</B> While some policymakers may doubt the merits of free trade, the available evidence suggests that the wealthiest countries are those whose borders are the most open to trade, and that the poorest are those whose borders are least open to trade. The available data show, for example, that countries with lower average tariff rates generally are the richest, and countries with higher average tariff rates generally are poorer.<SUP>6</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
There is a statistical correlation between lower tariff rates and higher levels of economic wealth (see <A HREF="fyi127c2.gif">Chart 2</A>). Moreover, the average per capita income level of countries with an average tariff rate of 4 percent or below is over $17,000.<SUP>7</SUP>  By contrast, the average per capita income level of countries with average tariff rates above 20 percent is below $2,000.

<P>
<DD>
Of course, tariffs are not the only forms of protectionism a country can use. A government may have a relatively low average tariff rate but still heavily protect its market. Thus, to demonstrate fully the connection between free trade and economic prosperity, it is necessary to analyze other forms of trade protection that go beyond tariffs and duties. These "non-tariff barriers" include import bans and quotas, strict licensing and labeling requirements, inspection requirements, corrupt customs officials, and strict antidumping and antitrust laws, among others.

<P>
<DD>
While such non-tariff barriers often are hard to measure, The Heritage Foundation has been quantifying them on a global basis for more than three years. Its <A HREF="/heritage/index"><I>1997 Index of Economic Freedom</I></A><SUP>8</SUP> includes an in-depth economic analysis of 150 countries based on ten broad economic factors, including international trade. The international trade component of the <I>Index</I> measures the average tariff rate and non-tariff barriers to trade per country. Using the <I>Index</I> trade scores, it is possible to identify a country's overall level of trade protectionism.<SUP>9</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
It is then possible to compare the individual trade scores with per capita GDP for each country. Such a comparison shows that countries with the lowest barriers to trade also are the richest, while those with the highest barriers to trade generally are the poorest.10  In fact, all the countries scored by the <I>Index</I> and determined to have "low" to "very low" barriers to trade have an average per capita income level of almost $15,000. By contrast, all the countries scored by the Index and determined to have "high" to "very high" barriers to trade have an average per capita income of less than $2,000. <A HREF="fyi127c3.gif">Chart 3</A> shows that countries having "mostly free trade" to "free trade" policies have higher levels of wealth per capita than those countries with "protectionist" to "partly free" trade policies.

<P>
<DD>
Perhaps an increase in a country's wealth precedes its free trade policies; perhaps the reverse is true. Either way, however, the correlation between lower barriers to trade and higher levels of wealth is real. The facts indicate that as countries open their borders more and more to trade, the wealth of their people is more and more likely to grow.
</UL>
<P>

<B>CONCLUSION</B>

<P>
<DD>
The Clinton Administration and the U.S. Congress should understand this relationship: Countries that pursue free trade are more likely to become wealthy than those that do not. This has important implications for the United States. What is good for the developing countries is good for America. Free trade must become a priority for the Clinton Administration and for the 105th Congress. Policymakers need to move quickly in this legislative year to enact important legislation on trade policies that will benefit America. Above all, Congress needs to grant the President fast-track authority to pursue the negotiation of new trade agreements. Armed with the statistical evidence linking free trade with prosperity and economic growth around the globe, policymakers will find it easy to support something that has been part of U.S. foreign policy since America's inception: a strong dedication to free trade.

<p><hr width=75% size=3><p>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

Atlantic City officials made a shocking discovery last week when
they entered a crumbling house and found 10 children who'd been 
abandoned.

<p>

For three weeks -- <i>three weeks</i> -- these children
were left to fend for themselves with no electricity or running
water.  Drug paraphernalia was found in the house and the smell
of crack cocaine hung in the air.  The children's only sources
of heat, during some of the year's most bitter cold, were two
kerosene heaters.

<p>

Why any parent would leave a child in such miserable conditions
is beyond comprehension.  There's no doubt that Washington has done 
a lot to make conditions in America's inner cities worse.  The 
welfare system has devastated the black family.  And politicians 
have failed to take the drug problem seriously enough, exposing 
more and more children to its deadly effects.

<p>

But at the end of the day, my friends, it's really a problem
of the human heart that leaves children in the cold.  It's a problem
that's beyond the realm of politics, and the answers won't be
found in the solutions of the right or left.  They will only come
with a renewal of the human soul.

America's electricity market is massive. Its total assets are worth approximately $500 billion and it has net profits of over $200 billion annually. The size of this market is not surprising, considering that almost every American is a consumer of electricity. Unfortunately, despite the fact that millions purchase and use electricity, few have a true choice in deciding from whom they will receive their service. And a confusing set of outdated, inefficient, and overlapping laws and regulations continue to govern the electricity industry at the federal, state, and local levels.

<P>
<DD>
Throughout this century, regulators have been conducting an experiment in America's electricity market that can be judged only as a failure. A lack of price competition and consumer choices, limited innovations, and a lackluster environmental record are some of the deleterious side effects of the current regulated monopolistic system. Consumers and the industry itself stand to benefit in important ways, however, once choice and free-market principles are substituted for the unsuccessful command-and-control methods of a regulated monopoly model. Kenneth Costello and Robert Graniere of the National Regulatory Research Institute (established by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners) have argued that the deregulation of industries in general has been beneficial:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The more scholarly studies have shown that deregulation has generally been a success story. Consumers have benefited greatly and the overall efficiency of the deregulated industries has improved greatly as well. Firms in these industries have reduced their costs, lowered their prices, introduced new services and reconfigured old services to better accommodate consumer preferences, and deployed new technologies and practices.<SUP>1</SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<DD>

Just as consumers, shareholders, and industry have benefited from deregulatory initiatives in aviation, natural gas, telecommunications, and transportation, the deregulation of the electricity marketplace promises similarly rich rewards.
<P>
<B>The Benefits of Deregulating the Market</B>

<P>
<DD>
The benefits of deregulating the electricity market fall into the following seven principal areas:

<P><UL>
<LI> Increased competition
<LI> Lower prices
<LI> Lower operating costs for businesses
<LI> Lower regional cost differences
<LI> More jobs
<LI> Increased reliability of service
<LI> A cleaner environment
</UL>

<P>
<DD>
First, deregulating the electricity market will create <B>a level playing field</B> for future rivalry and competition in the industry, ensuring that all companies have an equal chance to provide service to consumers. No longer will regulators determine which firms will be granted exclusive franchising arrangements. Furthermore, incumbent firms no longer will have their market turf protected through generous returns on their investment, which were guaranteed by regulatory fiat. In other words, deregulation means consumers, in free-market fashion, will call the shots in the electricity market, not regulators. Jonathan Marshall, an economics/energy reporter for the <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I>, wrote that "High-voltage transmission lines, veritable electron superhighways, carry power thousands of miles with low losses, expanding the scope of regional markets. With more computer power and intelligent metering, nothing stands in the way of extending retail competition down to the household level."<SUP>2</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
Second, deregulation will <B>lower prices</B>, which will empower residential consumers by letting them choose their own electricity supplier to find the best service. The current regulatory system forces consumers to bear very high costs. An important study by Clemson University professors Michael T. Maloney, Robert E. McCormick, and Robert D. Sauer for Citizens for a Sound Economy, a Washington-based think tank, revealed that in the long run the average monthly electricity bill of $69 for a typical residential customer could fall by approximately $30 -- a decline of 43 percent -- if consumers had a real choice in who served them.<SUP>3</SUP>  Short-run savings also would be significant. The authors estimated an average drop of $18 for those with an average monthly bill of $69. Overall, the study reported that consumers would save almost $107.6 billion annually if a truly competitive market were developed.<SUP>4</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
Such cost savings would come not only from direct competition as new firms enter the market, but also from the higher quality of service that this competition will foster. Wake Forest University professor of economics John C. Moorhouse observed that "[T]he variety of generating equipment and the large number of independent producers adds diversity to the system, lowering the probability of widespread equipment failure, and, thereby, reducing the amount of excess capacity required to provide a given level of service reliability."<SUP>5</SUP>  Moorhouse has argued that competition will mean a broadening of choices for electricity consumers and an overall increase in innovation within the industry. "Under competitive electricity generation, the market will provide an array of service standards that more closely match the mosaic of consumer preferences."<SUP>6</SUP> Furthermore,

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Competition not only leads firms to be more responsive to consumer demands, monitor costs more closely, and compete on the basis of price, it provides an incentive to be innovative because that may be the only way to get a temporary jump on rivals. Developing a new consumer service, a better method of reducing costs, or a faster way of dealing with problems promises the innovator a competitive edge.<SUP>7</SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<DD>
Third, deregulation will generate <B>lower prices for commercial businesses</B>, especially small businesses. Electricity usually represents a substantial portion of the overhead cost of doing business. Unfortunately, these costs do not disappear during the production process and are not freely absorbed. They are factored into the final cost of goods and services. Therefore, because businesses cannot shop for better electricity bargains, higher electricity prices are passed on to the customer. According to the Food Marketing Institute, in 1994 grocery stores spent approximately 4 percent of their net sales on electricity expenses. Roughly $700 of the sticker price of every new General Motors automobile purchased in the United States is attributable to electricity expenses.8  Such "pass-through" costs, which ultimately raise the prices consumers pay for goods and services, could be reduced significantly if America's corporate sector could shop for competitively priced electricity. 

<P>
<DD>
Moreover, although opponents of change may argue that only the large corporate users of electricity want reform, in reality it is the small business that stands to benefit most. Electricity bills can represent a much greater burden as a percentage of overall costs for a small business, especially a retail business with a low margin of profit.

<P>
<DD>
Fourth, deregulation will <B>equalize unjustifiable regional differences</B> in electricity prices. Wayne Crews, an economist with the Washington-based Competitive Enterprise Institute, noted that although the average price of electricity in the United States is about 7 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), this price varies widely from state to state, from roughly 5 cents to as much as 10 cents per kWh. Crews argues, therefore, that there are "extraordinary inefficiencies. If customers could bypass their local utilities and gain access to power generators located elsewhere, billions could be saved."  Consequently, he notes, "A mere one cent per kWh drop in the average cost of 7 cents would save industrial, commercial, and residential customers $28 billion per year."<SUP>9</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
Luckily, a number of state initiatives are under way around the country that foreshadow the benefits to come under nationwide deregulation. New Hampshire instituted a pilot project in electricity competition in May 1996 that allowed an unlimited number of companies to enter a small portion of the market to serve customers. Many companies involved in the New Hampshire experiment offered unique billing incentives and programs to encourage customers to switch providers, including free bird feeders and the opportunity to dedicate a certain portion of their monthly bills to an environmental group or program of their choice. Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York also have initiated successful pilot projects.

<P>
<DD>
These pilot programs have proved two important points. First, many companies exist that desire to serve customers in this field, and many more are likely to emerge if open entry is allowed. Just as the long-distance telephone market flourished once rivals had access to networks, these state-by-state experiments illustrate the desire of electricity entrepreneurs to offer new and innovative services directly to customers. Second, electricity consumers of all kinds can expect savings if the market is deregulated. The Illinois program has yielded average savings of 15 to 20 percent for residential customers, 20 to 25 percent for small businesses, and 25 to 35 percent for large commercial customers.<SUP>10</SUP>  The New Hampshire experiment has resulted in savings of 15 to 20 percent for non-industrial customers and 20 to 30 percent for industrial customers. Similar savings have been forthcoming in the New York and Massachusetts pilot programs. 

<P>
<DD>
Fifth, deregulation can <B>increase jobs</B> and benefit local communities. Some of the large monopolistic utilities that do not want consumers to have the opportunity to choose alternative providers have used scare tactics, intense lobbying, lavish campaign donations, and outright deception to convince their local communities that deregulation will cost them in jobs. Nothing could be further from the truth. Most of the large workforce cutbacks these firms warn may happen under deregulation have taken place already as a natural reaction to downsizing in this industry in general. If anything, competition is likely to increase employment in the industry as new firms enter the market or existing firms look to innovate in the face of increased rivalry.

<P>
<DD>
Sixth, deregulation will <B>increase service reliability.</B> Increased innovation by competing suppliers is also likely to bolster service reliability as utility firms realize their profits and markets are no longer protected. Under the regulated monopoly model, consumers are not able to switch to a new provider if their current provider proves unreliable. But under competitive conditions, service failures will be met with consumer rebellion and, consequently, a loss of profit. Nothing can strengthen the incentive to maintain high service standards more than this.

<P>
<DD>
The occasional claims that competition is already stretching the limits of the current networks' reliability and may cause major outages are patently obvious scare tactics used by the proponents of the status quo to derail reform legislation. Just as deregulation and competition in other industries have resulted in improved safety and reliability, so too will electricity markets benefit when liberalization occurs.

<P>
<DD>
Finally, deregulation can <B>benefit the environment.</B> In empowering consumers to be smarter, more demanding shoppers, deregulation forces power companies to meet higher standards of efficiency and cleanliness to ensure that the local communities are provided the power they want without increased pollution or other negative side effects. Competition breeds innovative solutions and alternatives to less efficient production methods in use today, which can only benefit the environment in the long run.

<P>
<B>The Key Principles for Reform</B>

<P>
<DD>
In recognizing the benefits of a reformed and restructured electricity market, a handful of deregulation bills were introduced during the 104th Congress. These bills may foreshadow the debate that will take place in the new session of Congress, as the authors of a 1993 study for Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. have noted:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The argument within the industry and regulatory circles is no longer whether there will be increased competition but how that increase should be managed, what role regulators should play and how transition costs can be smoothly and fairly apportioned.... <SUP>11</SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<DD>

In other words, although everyone may purport to champion the cause of deregulation, what really matters in the liberalization process is how to get from point A to point B. The major electricity deregulation bills introduced during the 104th Congress addressed this important question in markedly different ways. As the 105th Congress begins this process anew, legislators should keep eight important principles and strategies in mind to ensure a comprehensive deregulation of the electricity market:

<P>
<DD>
<B>1. Immediately eliminate</B> all barriers to entry in the market.

<P>
<DD>
<B>2. De-monopolize</B> the industry through divestiture or open access.

<P>
<DD>
<B>3. Enact</B> clear guidelines governing stranded cost recovery.

<P>
<DD>
<B>4. Privatize</B> the federal Power Marketing Administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority, and close the Rural Utilities Service.

<P>
<DD>
<B>5. Do not mandate</B> private sector use of alternative energy sources.

<P>
<DD>
<B>6. Avoid</B> new mandates, exclusions, and pork-barrel spending.

<P>
<DD>
<B>7. Avoid</B> costly new federal universal service mandates.

<P>
<DD>
<B>8. Establish</B> a timetable to abolish the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy.

<P>
<DD>
These principles form the foundation of effective electricity regulatory policy that will enhance the beneficial transition from government regulation to market competition. Congress should:

<P>
<DD>
<B>1. Eliminate barriers to entry that impose a constitutionally impermissible burden on commerce and competition within the electricity sector.</B> This is an important first step toward the creation of a free market in electricity. Such barriers include the Federal Power Act and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA), which federalized numerous responsibilities regarding electric holding company management. These should be repealed. Beyond these statues, almost all previous Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) orders must be overturned and other, more recent, statutes must be superseded by a more deregulatory-minded strategy. All regulations involving rate setting or price controls must end as companies enter a competitive market. Finally, exclusive state franchising must end and the "state action doctrine," which allows states to ignore federal antitrust laws and establish state-sanctioned monopolies, must be put to bed forever.

<P>
<DD>
<B>2. De-monopolize the industry through divestiture or an open access policy.</B> Tearing down the old laws will not prove to be thorough enough. Policymakers must devise methods to enable electricity consumers to choose their own service providers in a truly free market situation. The two models for achieving this are divestiture and open access. Divestiture, or mandatory vertical disaggregation, would separate generation facilities from transmission/distribution facilities. It is probably the easiest deregulatory path to follow. Incumbent utilities currently holding both generation and transmission/distribution facilities would be required to sell one side of their business to ensure that monopolistic vertical integration of the industry came to an end. This immediately would open transmission/distribution facilities to competition and thereby guarantee to consumers a choice in providers. A less controversial but more difficult deregulatory strategy to implement is that of <B>open access</B>. Like vertical disaggregation, open access would ensure consumer choice by requiring vertically integrated utilities to open transmission/distribution facilities to rivals to give competitors direct access to customers. Although this pro-competitive policy certainly would offer choice in providers, it also would require ongoing regulatory oversight to ensure that rivals were granted access to existing networks on non-discriminatory terms. Continuous legal squabbles and court battles are likely under such an approach.

<P>
<DD>
<B>3. Place clearer guidelines in legislation governing stranded cost recovery.</B> Do not allow states to use this process to hinder interstate commerce by favoring incumbent producers. Perhaps the most contentious issue in the debate of electricity deregulation is that of stranded costs--business investments that may be rendered obsolete by the rise of competition. Large regulated monopoly utilities claim that in allowing rivals to enter the market, policymakers will force incumbent utilities to bear the full burden of investments that have been made to serve customers in the past, many of which were demanded by regulators. Although the merits of stranded investments are often questionable, some are legitimate. Federal policy makers should let state and local governments make the compensatory determinations because those officials are most likely to have required the majority of such investments in the first place. Minimal federal guidelines may be needed to prevent "bad actor" states from using the process to discriminate against new rival producers, forcing them to incur outrageously excessive costs for compensation of stranded cost incurred by the incumbent utilities. This would serve as a barrier to entry and it would diminish the beneficial effects of other deregulatory efforts.

<P>
<DD>
<B>4. Privatize the federal Power Marketing Administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority, and close down the Rural Utilities Service.</B> The federal government operates four Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) to sell electricity generated by dams maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. It also operates the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the Rural Electrification Administration (REA), now known as the Rural Utilities Service (RUS). PMAs sell a sizable percentage of electricity each year, which begs the question of why the federal government remains in this business when its facilities could be run privately for profit. Congress recently put in place a plan to sell the Alaska Power Marketing Administration. Federal assistance to PMAs should end and the PMAs should be privatized before the turn of the century. This would result in significant budgetary savings between $15 billion and $30 billion.

<P>
<DD>
<B>5. Do not mandate the use of any particular source of energy, including renewable energy.</B> Beginning with the energy crisis of the 1970s, the federal government has been searching for alternative energy sources to help lessen America's dependence on fossil fuels, specifically oil. Unfortunately, this search led to a series of misguided federal investments and mandates on the private sector to force greater reliance on solar, wind, hydrothermal, synthetic fuels, and other alternative energy sources. These investments have proved too costly to continue or have failed to produce any hopeful signs that alternative energy and fuels can satisfy consumer demand successfully. Although policymakers seem willing to abandon failed federal energy programs when the price tag grows too large, many legislators continue to push for private sector mandates that require greater dependence on alternative or renewable energy sources. This is a mistake. Competitive markets, not more mandates, are the best way to encourage greater energy efficiency and the growth of alternative fuel sources.

<P>
<DD>
<B>6. Avoid including new mandates, exclusions, or pork-barrel spending in final legislation.</B> Deregulation legislation should not become a vehicle for other forms of pork-barrel spending or for new mandates on the private sector. Calls for the funding of new energy research and development programs or to mandate that electric companies devise special programs and rates for certain consumers should be ignored. Such meddling is not needed in a competitive free market. More important, legislators should not fall into the trap of allowing exclusions and carve-outs to be inserted into deregulation legislation because this will lead to calls for preferential treatment in the process by affected parties. All entities affected by the deregulatory process should be required to abide by the same laws to ensure the creation of a truly level playing field.

<P>
<DD>
<B>7. Avoid costly new federal universal service mandates or programs; leave such concerns to the states.</B> During the 1996 telecommunications debate, universal service was one of the foremost topics. Although Congress is understandably concerned that all U.S. households are served by modern utility networks, creating massive new spending programs or imposing federal universal service mandates to achieve this goal will be counterproductive. Complex subsidy mechanisms and pricing regulations only add burdensome new rules and regulations as Congress looks to repeal old ones. Furthermore, any assistance that is deemed necessary should not be administered at the federal level. The states and localities are in a better position to gauge and deliver assistance to those truly in need. If legislators insist on extending aid to individuals, it should be targeted through strict means-testing and delivered through a pro-competitive mechanism such as vouchers.

<P>
<DD>
<B>8. Establish a timetable to abolish the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Department of Energy (DOE).</B> Once competition comes to the electric world, federal regulation of the electricity marketplace can end. Abolition of the FERC and DOE should be vital components of any deregulatory plan because liberalization will not be completed until federal oversight ends. Any important regulatory functions that remain can be turned over to the states eventually or sunset on a specified schedule. 

<P>
<DD>
Without considering and embodying all of these principles, Congress will be unable to pass effective legislation to deregulate the electricity market. And deregulation is desperately needed.

<P>
<DD>
Reform of the electricity market will be the most important economic deregulation initiative taken up by Congress for the rest of the decade. If true comprehensive reforms are instituted, their effects will be felt well into the next century in the form of greater technological innovation, expanded economic output, and significant consumer savings.

<P>
<DD>
"The technical and economic knowledge exist to permit the substitution of market competition for state ownership or government regulation in the electricity generation industry," according to economist John Moorhouse from Wake Forest University.<SUP>12</SUP>  Congress must take the necessary steps to ensure this beneficial transition occurs immediately and without unnecessary encumbrance. Loading the legislation with payoffs to well-heeled special interests and favored constituents will not help this effort in the long run. A clean break with the past must occur that severs all ties to the regulated monopoly model of this industry. 

<P>
<B>HOW REGULATION SHORT-CIRCUITED THE ELECTRICITY MARKET</B>

<P>
<B>Natural Monopoly or Competitive Industry?</B>

<P>
<DD>
Although it is popular for analysts to speak of the electricity industry as a natural monopoly, even a brief review of the development of the industry will lead to the opposite conclusion. Industry historian Robert L. Bradley, Jr., president of the Houston-based Institute for Energy Research, has noted, "The opening era of the electric industry was characterized by competing franchises and `regulation by competition.'"<SUP>13</SUP>  In other words, rivalry, not regulation, protected consumers. In fact, as economist Burton N. Behling noted in 1938, "There is scarcely a city in the country that has not experienced competition in one or more of the utility industries."<SUP>14</SUP>  Behling noted that six electrical companies were organized in 1887 to serve New York City and five companies vied for customer loyalty in Chicago in 1907. Smaller cities also saw competitors rise up to serve their citizens. Duluth, Minnesota, was served by five electrical companies in 1895, and Scranton, Pennsylvania, was served by four firms in 1906.<SUP>15</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
The result of this free market experience, which lasted from 1882 to 1907, was, in Bradley's words, "very positive for consumers.... [T]he quantity [of electricity] supplied was rapidly increasing from technological advances and expanding affordability, and prices were falling from declining costs and open competition."<SUP>16</SUP>  This era also saw a staggering increase in generation capacity and overall production capability. As Bradley aptly noted, "This expansion rate, which would not be subsequently equaled, hardly suggests the 'monopolistic' practice of restricting output to maintain or increase prices."<SUP>17</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
This evidence strongly suggests that the electric industry was never a natural monopoly. Technically, a natural monopoly exists when a single firm can produce the entire amount of output demanded by consumers at a lower cost than multiple suppliers might provide; yet, as Bradley notes, when multiple competitors served customers during this period, costs and prices were falling. Some economists argue that the electric market is a natural monopoly because of the nature of the transmission and distribution facilities required to deliver power to consumers. Because there are substantial costs associated with the construction of independent transmission facilities, some economists have postulated that it might be more efficient if a single firm built and controlled the entire transmission network; it would be inefficient to duplicate these expensive existing facilities. The evidence illustrates, however, that this is only conjecture; many firms during this period sought to build independent, competing infrastructures and did so while turning a profit.

<P>
<B>The Rise of Public Utility Commissions and Public Monopoly</B>

<P>
<DD>
Real monopolies eventually developed within the electric market for reasons that had little to do with the operation of the free market. Large incumbent electric firms, primarily led by the head of the Chicago Edison Company, Samuel Insull, set out to solidify their market share and power in the early years of this century by effectively excluding the entry of new rivals. "New entry and price wars from entry were continually making life difficult for the incumbent firms," according to historian Bradley.<SUP>18</SUP>  Therefore, instead of beating back rivalry by cutting prices or expanding consumer options, the large incumbent electricity producers concocted "natural monopoly" theories to justify intervention by state regulatory bodies -- commonly referred to as public utility commissions (PUCs). As Bradley states, "'Natural monopoly' was not natural, and a political monopoly was sought instead."<SUP>19</SUP>  Thus, state regulatory commissions were born and given the power to establish exclusive monopolistic service areas, or franchises, for these incumbent firms and to regulate the rates and quality of service.<SUP>20</SUP>  In essence, the PUCs required electric companies to serve a given area at a given price, but simultaneously guaranteed that these companies would receive stable and, in many cases, very generous profits, and freedom from the threat of rivals' competitive entry.

<P>
<DD>
Although this model of regulation was undertaken in the name of consumer protection and the "public interest," in hindsight it is obvious it had more to do with the protection of producers from competition and, as a consequence, did little to benefit consumers. "[S]tate regulation of electric utilities was primarily a pro-producer policy," economist Gregg A. Jarrell noted in a 1978 article describing how and why state regulation of the electric market developed.<SUP>21</SUP>  In his seminal piece, Jarrell reveals that those states that were among the first to institute state regulatory commissions did not exhibit higher prices, restricted output, and exorbitant corporate profits like natural monopoly theorists have suggested. In fact, exactly the opposite was the case. Utility companies in the states that created the earliest PUCs "had 46 percent lower prices, 38 percent lower gross profits, and 23 percent higher output than did utilities in later-regulated states....  These empirical results are difficult to square with the traditional explanation that state regulation was designed to minimize the undesirable social consequences of a naturally monopolistic electric industry."<SUP>22</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
Jarrell's findings prove that something besides an uncompetitive naturally monopolistic marketplace drove policymakers and large utility companies to agree to establish the regulatory regimes in the early years of this century. And what drove the creation of state commission regulation was vigorous competition, not the lack thereof. This led Jarrell to conclude appropriately, "[S]tate regulation potentially had much to offer public utilities. The electric utility interests were not acting suicidally when, around 1910, they became the main champions of the movement for state regulation."<SUP>23</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
History has shown that competition is not only possible, it has been a better servant of the consumer; yet it met its demise in the electricity market as PUCs began popping up in state after state at the behest of large utility companies. Thought to be less susceptible to political corruptibility than municipal legislators, PUCs were viewed as scientific regulators that could micromanage successfully the day-to-day operations of a highly technical industry. It quickly became apparent, however, that PUCs were just as easily controlled by those they regulated because they had to rely on those entities to carry out their policy goals.<SUP>24</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
This fact should not be surprising. Noted regulatory economist Alfred E. Kahn argued in 1971:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	When a commission is responsible for the performance of an industry, it is under never completely escapable pressure to protect the health of the companies it regulates, to assure a desirable performance by relying on those monopolistic chosen instruments and its own controls rather than on the unplanned and unplannable forces of competition.<SUP>25</SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>
<DD>
Furthermore, Kahn notes, "Responsible for the continued provision and improvement of service, [the regulatory commission] comes increasingly and understandably to identify the interest of the public with that of the existing companies on whom it must rely to deliver goods."<SUP>26</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
<B>The Advent of Federal Intervention.</B> As the industry matured, complex corporate holding structures developed that allowed many utilities to become national in scope. Most large electric utilities had become completely vertically integrated -- single companies controlled not only the bulk of the generation facilities, but also the transmission and distribution lines that represented the only link to final customers. The resulting development of a complex, vertically integrated interstate electricity marketplace meant states no longer had clear jurisdiction over these national entities. The combination of regulatory failure at the state level and the simultaneous expansion of the interstate electricity market led to calls for federal intervention. In 1935, a watershed was marked in the history of electricity regulation when Congress passed two major statutes providing federal policy makers greater authority over the industry: the <B>Federal Power Act</B> (FPA) and the <B>Public Utility Holding Company Act</B> (PUHCA).

<P>
<DD>
The Federal Power Act of 1935 initiated the federal regulation of interstate and wholesale electric power transmission and transactions. Wholesale electricity transmission involves the sale of power by generators to other generators that control transmission and distribution facilities. The FPA also created the Federal Power Commission (FPC) to regulate interstate rates and quality, promote interconnection among firms, and restrict mergers and acquisitions if its members felt this was necessary. Four decades later, in 1977, the FPC was replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as part of the Department of Energy Organization Act.

<P>
<DD>
The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 proved to be very significant in the historic development of the industry, for it federalized certain responsibilities regarding holding company management. Electric holding companies, the umbrella companies that manage many smaller utilities, popped up across the United States in the 1920s and 1930s. Policymakers feared that these much larger and concentrated entities could deceive their investors by shuffling finances among the many different branches, divisions, or affiliates they managed. It was also widely feared that states no longer could control the actions of holding companies, which were national in scope and therefore outside state jurisdiction.

<P>
<DD>
As a result, the PUHCA was passed. It requires holding companies that own or control more than 10 percent of another utility to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and provide detailed records of their financial transactions and holdings. The law also restricts merger and acquisition activity, curtails investment in non-utility industries, prohibits intercompany loans, and strictly regulates other financial transactions such as the issuance of new securities. Most important, the statute constrains and even narrows the powers of holding companies -- allowing them essentially to control only utilities within a given state -- to maximize state control, a primary objective. Finally, the PUHCA created and maintains a regulatory distinction between "registered" and "exempt" holding companies. To qualify for an exemption from the PUHCA, a holding company primarily must be intrastate in geographic scope and limited in business operations to the provision of a basic utility service. Not surprisingly, this generally has discouraged firms from expanding operations; only 14 "registered" holding companies currently exist in the United States. Over 150 "exempt" holding companies exist that exclusively serve customers within their own states.

<P>
<DD>
Over time, critics of the PUHCA have noted that the law's impact was obviously to restrain or at least delay beneficial economies of scale from developing via expanded interstate integration of facilities.<SUP>27</SUP>  This is still somewhat the case, although the larger problem posed by the continued existence of the PUHCA lies in the way it prohibits innovative state and local experiments to foster a competitive marketplace. As Michael Block, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Progress and Freedom Foundation, notes, the PUHCA is "a major barrier to reform efforts underway in the states" because it "greatly hinders and complicates... state efforts at introducing competition."<SUP>28</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
Despite the fact that almost every state is considering plans to restructure its respective utility sectors, the PUHCA discourages such mutually beneficial experiments. It prohibits the states from opening up the retail electric market to competition through "unbundling," the process of separating the functions of the electric industry into its three distinct components -- generation, transmission, and distribution -- in order to allow consumers to purchase electricity from generators of their choice. By generally restricting or discouraging interstate integration and expansion, state-by-state restructuring efforts become difficult, since the unbundling process might serve to create new federal holding companies and thereby create a vicious circle of regulatory and legal battles among state and federal policymakers. A number of other requirements under the PUHCA might shift these newly restructured entities effectively into new regulatory classifications. Both the states and the industry players would be discouraged from advocating such actions while the PUHCA remains in place.<SUP>29</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
It is both ironic and unfortunate that although the PUHCA's intent was to encourage primary control over utilities to remain with the states, it has had the effect of restraining their efforts to encourage greater competition in the electric industry. Furthermore, as a recent Progress and Freedom Foundation report noted: "Although PUHCA is viewed as serving consumers' interest by limiting market power through merger control, in fact the Act <I>increases</I> market power by raising barriers to entry into newly restructured markets."<SUP>30</SUP>  In other words, if the PUHCA remains intact much longer, efforts to expand competition are less likely to move forward successfully in the near future.

<B>The Federal Power Producers.</B> The New Deal period brought not only the rise of direct federal regulation of the electric industry, it also marked the beginning of the direct federal provision of power through the Rural Electrification Administration (REA), the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and a handful of federal Power Market Administrations (PMAs). Legislators in the 1930s believed federal action was needed to facilitate the development of rural America and ensure that rural citizens were guaranteed access to certain technologies that were becoming fairly ubiquitous throughout urban America. To make certain that electric power was available to the poorest and the most remote areas of the nation, federal legislators implemented an "alphabet soup" package of programs in the 1930s:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>REA (RUS).</B> The Rural Electrification Administration (now the Rural Utilities Service, or RUS) was created in 1936 to electrify rural America by providing subsidized loans and grants to rural electric cooperatives. In the 1930s, only a fraction of farms and rural households had access to electricity, but by the mid-1950s the proportion of rural homes with electricity matched suburban penetration. REA continued to expand into the 1990s despite this achievement, and it continued to provide deeply subsidized credit to eligible electric co-ops until 1993, when Congress lessened the interest rate subsidy available on these federal loans. Currently, the highest rate paid by an electric co-op borrower is the lesser of 7 percent or the rate the U.S. Treasury pays to borrow.
<P>
	<B>TVA.</B> The Tennessee Valley Authority was created in 1933 to serve the power needs of much of the Appalachian region and ensure it developed commercially over time. Over the past few decades, the TVA has developed numerous nuclear facilities that, for a variety of reasons, have proven uneconomic and non-operational. This has caused the accumulation of billions of dollars worth of TVA debt. Worse, the TVA continues to hold the Appalachian region hostage to its monopoly -- customers in that region have even fewer purchasing options than residents of other regions of the United States.
<P>
	<B>PMAs.</B> The Department of Energy (DOE) operates five Power Marketing Administrations, which sell at the wholesale level electricity that has been generated by approximately 130 power plants (mostly dams) built and maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. In 1994, the Alaska, Bonneville, Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western Area PMAs sold nearly $3 billion worth of electricity, according to the Energy Information Administration. Like the TVA, PMAs have continued to receive generous subsidies to remain in business.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<DD>
Despite the radical demographic and economic alteration of America's rural communities since the New Deal era, these federal power programs have remained intact. Although rural America has grown and prospered in relation to urban communities in the postwar era, the New Deal power programs continue to be run as if rural America was an economic wasteland incapable of supporting itself. In fact, Douglas A. Houston, professor of business economics at the University of Kansas and one of America's leading experts on federal power issues, has observed that federal power programs are nothing more than old-fashioned redistributionist programs that inefficiently attempt to continue a mission that was completed long ago. Houston notes that the TVA and the PMAs receive roughly $7 billion to $10 billion in subsidies per year.<SUP>31</SUP>  In his words, "These subsidies simply transfer wealth to a set of lucky citizens who are no less affluent than their fellow citizen-taxpayers."<SUP>32</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
<B>The Privatization Option.</B> Although privatization options for the electricity industry have been advocated by various parties for quite some time, supporters of the status quo argue that federal power producers are not subsidized in the first place. The opposite is the case: Public power entities certainly receive generous subsidies. The TVA and PMAs receive federal loan guarantees and below-rate interest charges on federal loans, tax-exempt status from federal and state income taxes, and other important tax breaks including lower property taxes and smaller excise taxes.<SUP>33</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
Although supporters of the status quo also argue that privatization options would "hurt" consumers, there is an overwhelming consensus among experts that privatization would benefit all Americans. Douglas Houston has estimated that privatizing the TVA and the PMAs would generate between $15 billion and $30 billion for federal coffers.

<P>
<DD>
The continued existence of these federal power programs does more than just squander taxpayer money. It will hurt consumers by discouraging the development of competitive opportunities in those areas in which the federal power providers remain active because these entities are accorded favorable treatment relative to private power providers. In other words, if legislators attempt to open electric markets to competition without simultaneously privatizing the TVA and PMAs, a most uneven playing field will be the result, which will diminish the beneficial effects of liberalization for consumers.

<P>
<DD>
Dozens of public power privatizations have taken place in the past few years across the globe, yet only one of the five American PMAs -- the Alaska Power Marketing Administration -- is scheduled to be privatized. Furthermore, the RUS remains intact despite the fact that its mission has also been completed. Hence, unfair and anticompetitive subsidies remain in the electricity marketplace that must be eliminated if deregulation is to be a success.
<P>

<B>The Development of the Modern Industry</B>

<P>
<DD>
The result of the growth of federal and state regulatory policies in the electricity marketplace was an industry structure that changed little from the New Deal era to the late 1970s. The four primary types of service providers that dominated the post-New Deal era were investor-owned utilities, publicly owned utilities, cooperative utilities, and federally operated utilities.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Investor-owned utilities:</B> Most Americans are serviced by private, investor-owned utilities (IOUs) with publicly traded stock that is freely traded in the market by their shareholders. Although IOUs must operate under the regulatory constraints imposed by state PUCs, their financial health is all but guaranteed. That is, although PUCs must impose certain restraints on the profits and the prices IOUs can charge consumers, PUCs also are careful to ensure the financial viability of these IOUs by shielding them from competitive forces and other risk factors. As a result, any IOU inefficiency is actually rewarded -- <I>the higher the costs they incur, the greater their revenues and profits because their rate of return is set by regulators to cover their costs plus a profit.</I> This is referred to as "rate of return" or "cost-plus" regulation. Thanks to cost-plus regulation, IOUs are one of the most popular stocks with long-term institutional investors; they yield generous returns while posing little risk to the stockholders' portfolios. But, although IOUs are accorded certain protections and guarantees from the PUCs that regulate them, IOUs are taxed and treated like all other private business.
<P>
	<B>Publicly owned utilities:</B> From the late 1800s through the New Deal era, numerous municipalities across the United States established their own public power facilities to serve their communities exclusively. Publicly owned utilities still serve such large cities as Los Angeles and Seattle. They are exempted from state and federal taxes and can sell tax-exempt securities on the open market, a benefit that caused many private sector investor-owned utilities to charge that publicly owned utilities have an unfair advantage that allows them to acquire capital more cheaply.

<P>
	<B>Cooperative utilities:</B> Many utilities are collectively owned by a group of organizations that run the utility exclusively for their own use. They primarily serve co-op organizations in rural communities, such as groups of farmers. These cooperative utilities can incorporate within their state and be taxed by the state accordingly, but they are often exempted from all state and local taxes. Cooperatives also are able to draw on funds and technical expertise from the RUS and are not forced to pay federal taxes.

<P>
	<B>Federal electric utilities:</B> The federal government owns and operates a handful of large power companies. The TVA and the PMAs are funded by federal tax dollars and therefore pay no taxes. Federal electric utilities resell much of their generated power to publicly owned and cooperative utilities at cheap rates; this power is then resold to the end users.

<P>
<B>The Resurrection of Competitive Power Generation Facilities</B>

<P>
<DD>
The late 1970s witnessed -- quite accidentally -- the birth of an important new segment of the electricity industry known as the independent power producers, or the IPPs. During the energy crisis in the 1970s, Congress felt compelled to do more to encourage energy conservation within the electricity industry.

<P>
<DD>
<B>The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA)</B> was enacted largely to encourage the use of alternative energies. Its method of doing so was by designating certain small IPPs (such as solar, wind, and geothermal producers) and co-generators (which simultaneously produce both electricity and steam, heat, or other forms of useful energy) as "qualifying facilities" (QFs). Alternative energy producers that were designated QF earned exemptions from existing laws, most notably the PUHCA. More important, incumbent regulated utilities were required to purchase electricity wholesale from these qualifying facilities at their "avoided cost."  This meant regulated utilities were forced to purchase QF-produced electricity at the same cost they would have incurred producing it themselves or purchasing it from another comparable provider.

<P>
<DD>
Ironically, although the PURPA was meant to be an environmental statute, it had the more remarkable -- and entirely accidental -- effect of fostering increased competition within the field of electricity generation. According to data from the Energy Information Administration's <I>Annual Energy Review 1995</I>, prices dropped rapidly after the introduction of the PURPA, from roughly 7.8 cents per kWh in 1980 to roughly 6.4 cents per kWh in 1995. As prices fell and supplier options multiplied, it became increasingly obvious to industry watchers that a viable free market might exist in the electric industry. And since 1990, IPPs have made over half of all new investment in new generating facilities.<SUP>34</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
A 1992 report by President George Bush's Council on Competitiveness noted that "The experience gained through PURPA shows that non-utility firms can build innovative, economic, and reliable power plants."<SUP>35</SUP>  President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers agreed, and stated in its 1996 <I>Economic Report of the President</I>, "PURPA demonstrated that independents could build generators on time and on budget and could be reliably integrated into the transmission grid, subject to utilities' control."<SUP>36</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
And Richard F. Hirsh, author of <I>Technology and Transformation in the Electricity Industry</I>, argues that perhaps the most important outcome of the PURPA is that it "has furthered moves for even more deregulation by stimulating discussions about the rationale for the utility industry's status as a natural monopoly" because independent power producers proved they could make better use of resources and also help reduce costs (which is not supposed to happen in a market thought to be naturally monopolistic).<SUP>37</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
Under the <B>Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992</B>, the pro-competitive benefits of the PURPA were extended and enhanced. The Act gave non-utility generators the right to engage in wholesale "wheeling," whereby they could sell power to any other utility along the transmission lines, not just the local utility that was situated the closest to them. To foster this activity, the EPAct created an important new legal classification known as the "exempt wholesale generator" (EWG) that would not be considered a traditional utility and, therefore, would not be covered by regulations the other utilities faced (most notably, the PUHCA). Legal scholars Jeffrey D. Watkiss and Douglas W. Smith noted that the Energy Policy Act "fundamentally changes federal regulation of the electric utility industry, greatly facilitating the development of a competitive market for wholesale electric power" and that it "may prove to be the watershed event leading to a restructured U.S. power market."<SUP>38</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
In April 1996, to implement and extend further the pro-competitive benefits of the PURPA and EPAct, the FERC issued <B>Orders No. 888 and No. 889</B>; these orders provided more specific guidelines on how transmission lines are to be opened up to competitors on a non-discriminatory basis. The orders require vertically integrated monopolistic utilities to offer access at a single-tariff rate comparable to what they would charge themselves for similar access. The FERC has estimated that approximately $3.8 to $5.4 billion in benefits will be generated each year under these proposals.<SUP>39</SUP>

<P>
<B>PULLING THE PLUG ON REGULATION</B>

<P>
<B>The Avenues of Choice</B>

<P>
<DD>
The PURPA, the EPAct of 1992, and the latest FERC orders seeking to open up the electricity marketplace to competition all build on the open access philosophy of deregulation. Complete open access within the electric market would require all vertically integrated utilities to open their transmission and distribution facilities to rivals so they could "wheel" their power across those lines to customers. Currently, under the PURPA, the EPAct, and FERC No. 888, only "wholesale wheeling" has been required; independent producers have been given only the ability to sell their power to other generating utilities who then make that power available for resale to customers along their lines. "Retail wheeling"  would allow these independent generators to sell their power directly to any sort of final customer along the transmission/distribution lines, whether they are commercial, industrial, or residential consumers.

<P>
<DD>
<B>Open access.</B> Open access to existing networks is a somewhat controversial deregulation strategy because its application and continuation does require a small degree of transitional regulation and raises legal concerns about ownership and control of transmission networks. Open access has proven itself vastly superior, however, to the current regulatory arrangement. As Competitive Enterprise Institute analyst Matthew C. Hoffman noted of the superiority of access regimes in 1994:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	A retail wheeling regime... would reduce the scope of regulatory oversight significantly. Regulators who are currently charged with monitoring utility expenditures and second-guessing a range of utility investment decisions through "prudence reviews" would confine their focus to expenditures associated with the absorption and retransmission of power, and the maintenance of transmission capacity by the host utility in its capacity as transactor on behalf of retail buyers within its service territory. Although utilities have nominal ownership of transmission and generation capacity, those assets were obtained by utilities through a system of monopoly privilege protected by state and federal governments. Requiring utilities to facilitate any transactions of an open electricity market by wheeling power for customers in their service areas is hardly unreasonable.<SUP>40</SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<DD>

Open access would provide a smooth transition to a truly free and competitive electricity marketplace. Competitive forces and incentives would be active in the market. Going "cold turkey" in approaching deregulation, on the other hand, would allow the large regulated monopolies, which were put in their advantageous position by government officials, to continue operating on a significantly uneven playing field. Open access requirements level the playing field, as new entrants prepare to battle existing incumbents in a deregulated environment. Regulatory economist Clyde Wayne Crews of the Competitive Enterprise Institute asks, "Does it make sense for monopoly utilities suddenly to enjoy a massive expansion of access to customers over monopolized transmission lines while non-utility power generators remain shut out, and while the final customer is denied direct access over those same semi-public rights of way?"<SUP>41</SUP>  Crews argues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	PUHCA repeal might afford some added efficiencies in provision of electric service, but a far more important issue -- which should be the sine qua non for repeal -- is that of direct customer access and choice in the marketplace. Direct access should be the price of repeal.<SUP>42</SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<DD>
In the natural gas market, open access policies initiated by Congress under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and carried out by the FERC throughout the 1980s have proved to benefit that industry and its consumers greatly in just this fashion. Economists Michael J. Doane and Daniel Spulber noted that "open access has brought competition to the national market for natural gas," with superior pricing polices and more efficient contractual arrangements.<SUP>43</SUP>  Open access arrangements also are being utilized in the telecommunications market to spur competitive forces. In passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress made open access and interconnection the centerpiece of its deregulatory strategy for an industry that shares a common regulatory history with the electricity sector.<SUP>44</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
Open access, therefore, would <I>functionally unbundle</I> distinct network components and ensure that the monopolistic utilities could not restrict access to the transmission network unfairly. This would provide consumers a real choice in who supplies them with electricity.

<P>
<DD>
<B>Divestiture.</B> Vertical disaggregation, or divestiture, is the only other realistic deregulatory method beside open access policies that legislators could employ to ensure competition takes hold in this industry. Monopolization of transmission and distribution facilities was forced on the electricity marketplace when vertical integration was viewed as the most efficient method of "energizing America."  But once individual utilities were handed control of all transmission and distribution facilities, vigorous competition no longer was possible. Disaggregation can correct this historical mistake by requiring that the monopolistic electricity companies divest either their generation or transmission/distribution facilities, and sell them in an open-market auction. This <I>structural unbundling</I> requires the distinct breaking apart of the major components of the electric industry.

<P>
<DD>
Such divestiture, similar to that required of AT&T in the early 1980s, would have the effect of immediately creating a competitive market for electricity generating and primary transmission/distribution facilities in a given region. Under divestiture, the large monopolistic utilities would choose the segment of the electricity business in which they preferred to remain -- generation or transmission/distribution, and they would sell the other facilities and assets in open market sale.

<P>
<DD>
In all likelihood, most large utilities would opt to retain their transmission lines and divest their generation facilities because the transmission business promises to be extremely lucrative. This might help solve one of their dilemmas -- the recovery of stranded costs -- because they could sell off their generating assets if they are less profitable or economic. The revenues generated by auctioning less efficient generating facilities, for example, would allow utilities to recover at least some of the costs associated with undesired plants and assets.

<P>
<DD>
Divestiture presents a slightly more radical, although easier, method of ending the state of uncompetitive vertical integration in the electricity market. It is more radical in that it requires the legal separation of assets previously controlled by individual monopolies. Yet it is simpler than enacting an open access solution; it would not require detailed transitional rules and new regulations that could prove counterproductive. Once divestiture is pursued, the complete and immediate deregulation of all other rules can be undertaken safely.

<P>
<DD>
<B>The Case Against "Cold Turkey" Deregulation.</B> The only remaining option beside divestiture or open access would be to take a "cold turkey" deregulatory approach and simply eliminate existing rules without any serious attempt to de-monopolize the industry. Although this approach has great appeal, in principle it suffers from practical defects. Among them are:
A de-monopolization period is needed to right the regulatory wrongs of the past. State and federal legislative and regulatory actions led to monopolies within the market initially, and a deregulatory period would offer legislators a unique opportunity to re-establish the industry on the correct, pro-competitive track.

<P>
<DD>
The physics of producing electricity means that alternative, independent utility transmission and distribution networks cannot proliferate as rapidly as have the telecommunications networks. De-monopolization efforts are needed to ensure that, until competing lines can be constructed, customers can access multiple suppliers.<SUP>45</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
If monopolies are not broken up by legislative action soon, a host of legal battles regarding network access will arise quickly, forcing court-mandated divestiture upon monopolistic utilities. If the courts are to be kept out of the process so that elected, accountable representatives determine which de-monopolization strategy should be pursued, legislators at the state and federal levels must craft the strategies to deal with the uncompetitive structure of the industry.

<P>
<DD>
Open access or vertical disaggregation, therefore, are transitional mechanisms that, over time, could move the industry away from the archaic regulated monopoly model toward a new free market model based on consumer choice. 

<P>
<B>The Biggest Hurdle: Stranded Costs</B>

<P>
<DD>
Although the benefits of competition are relatively clear, an important impediment to reform exists -- the problem of stranded costs or the investments regulated utilities made over time that may become uneconomical with the onset of competition. For example, if competitors with superior generating facilities are able to enter the market and offer power directly to customers, the assets and facilities owned by the regulated utilities quickly may become obsolete or uneconomical to operate. Historically, deregulation often has been followed by the anticipated shake-out of inefficient services and facilities, whether it occurred in the telecommunications, transportation, or natural gas industries. Irwin M. Stelzer, director of regulatory policy studies at the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute, observed:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The argument that regulatory rules should not be changed, especially after billions have been invested pursuant to those rules, has considerable appeal, but it is in the end not entirely compelling. Every utility executive has always known, and many have loudly proclaimed, that regulators are fickle, responding to changing fashions, the political winds, and, often at the urging of the industry, to changing economic circumstances. Surely, it is not implausible to assume that intelligent investors factored the risk of rule changes into the return they have demanded for exposing their capital to the tender mercies of [regulators].
<P>

	Is it not... plausible to argue that investors knew that regulatory rules change, that they made their investments forewarned of that possibility, and that they have in the past been compensated for the risks for such changes?  Also... utility shares have often sold at prices that suggest that shareholders anticipated and received earnings well above those that strict regulation might produce. So... it is arguable that investors have received rewards that have amply compensated them for the risk that rules would be changed.<SUP>46</SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<DD>
Holman W. Jenkins, business columnist for <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, echoed these sentiments: "[W]hy should utility investors be uniquely indemnified against change?  That favor was not forthcoming to the owners of airlines, railroads, and natural gas and trucking companies. And anybody who was paying attention saw that electricity was destined for the same buzzsaw."<SUP>47</SUP>  A large number of utilities already have absorbed their losses by gradually writing off a large number of assets they feel may prove to be uneconomical in the future. Utilities that waited to make such sound business decisions hardly should be rewarded when other firms absorbed these losses for years. In addition, most large utility stocks are held in portfolios that are controlled by institutional investors on Wall Street, not by old grandmothers or retired couples -- as many utilities would lead the public to believe. Institutional investors write off such losses by downgrading utility stocks that appear risky in a competitive future. Because of these facts, further stranded cost recovery is difficult to justify.

<P>
<DD>
The monopolistic utilities that stand to lose the most if stranded investments are not recoverable argue that a "regulatory compact" existing among legislators, the public, electric companies, and their shareholders must be honored. They argue that they have made investments in good faith, believing that their companies would always have a safety net if things went wrong.<SUP>48</SUP>  Beyond Stelzer's arguments, little substantive evidence can be offered by these utilities to show such an explicit compact or contract existed. Although a handful of court cases allude to the general concept of a compact among monopolistic utilities, the government, and the public, these cannot seriously be held up as the equivalent of an actual contract signed by all parties affected, especially the consuming public. There is no reason to believe the public would have accepted voluntarily restricted choice, mediocre service, and high electricity prices. As Wayne Crews has argued, "this so-called compact is one-sided; ratepayers were never asked if they wanted to take part in it, nor did they ever sign such an agreement. And even if ratepayers had signed such a deal, a rational contract would have included the right to opt out once cheaper service became available."<SUP>49</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
Monopolistic utilities also argue that they have been unfairly required by policymakers and regulators to make numerous investments that may prove uneconomic in the competitive future. When utilities can show that they invested in certain facilities or projects as a result of a direct written order or the strict request of a regulator or legislative official, then they have grounds for recovery. Yet claims currently being made by such utilities greatly exceed such reasonable judgments. In fact, aggregate stranded cost estimates that are frequently tossed around in industry discussions and trade journals range from a low of $50 billion to an amazing $500 billion. Most utilities that stand to gain the most use an approximate figure of $200 billion. Even this figure is absurd when it is compared with annual industry revenues that are approximately the same. If monopolistic utilities argue that their past investments were so ill-considered that their potential losses in a competitive market are roughly equal to the amount of money they now earn collectively each year, then this is a serious indictment of the current monopolistic system. It is difficult to imagine that a free electricity market would produce inefficiencies of this extent.

<P>
<DD>
Even worse, if recovery of stranded investments of the magnitude the industry estimates is mandated by policymakers, then any savings that America's electricity consumers expect as a result of deregulation would be negated by increased payments to large monopolies. If large utilities successfully make stranded cost recovery the quid pro quo for competitive entry, not only will electricity users have to foot the hefty bill in the form of higher prices, but they will also have fewer options and less sophisticated service. This certainly will be true if the potential new industry entrants are discouraged from tapping the new markets because they will face such a high entry fee.

<P>
<B>A BLUEPRINT FOR DEREGULATING THE ELECTRICITY MARKET</B>
<P>
<B>Why Federal Action Is Needed</B>

<P>
<DD>
Immediate legislative action is needed at the federal level to ensure that consumers reap the rewards of a more competitive electricity market in the future. Policymakers should be prepared for opposition. Industry representatives may argue that government action is not needed or that, if any legislative action is called for, it needs to take place only at the state level. Such arguments represent the kinds of "stall tactics" that will be used by the large monopolistic utilities who hope to delay the deregulatory process or at least to move the debate into the state legislatures, where they believe their lobbying with have a better chance of achieving a more favorable outcome.

<P>
<DD>
Although there is certainly an important role for the states and localities in the deregulatory process, federal action must be pursued for three principal reasons:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>The electricity market is increasingly becoming a seamless web of interconnected networks that will resist being carved into neatly defined and clearly distinct markets or regulatory jurisdictions.</B> Like the airline, telecommunications, and trucking industries that required federal deregulatory action, the U.S. electricity market has become so large and interacts so smoothly across state lines that regulation based primarily on geographic boundaries makes little sense today. When electrical current travels over state borders, the physical nature of that current does not change, yet the laws governing it do change. This causes unjustifiable differences in rates from one region of the United States to another and other unnecessary burdens on interstate commerce that only federal action can rectify.
<P>
<LI><B>Large service areas that could be served by many alternative power providers across the United States are restricted by the single firm monopolies that have been given exclusive franchising arrangements.</B> Unfortunately, exclusive franchises remain across the United States and continue to prohibit competition. These franchises present an unjustifiable burden on interstate commerce and should therefore be ended. Fred Smith, president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, aptly argues, "There is no theory of 'states rights' that legitimizes a state's barring citizens within its borders from purchasing power from outside the state.... Nor is there any 'right' to prohibit a generator from selling outside of its state's borders. The interstate commerce clause of the Constitution was intended to prohibit such restraints of trade."<SUP>50</SUP>  Yet many states, comfortable with their monopolistic franchises, are not likely to end this system on their own. Hence, federal action is required.
<P>
<LI><B>Many of the problems associated with the modern electric industry were created by federal statutes and regulations.</B> These statutes and regulations are still on the books and continue to distort or disallow competition from developing in this industry. The Federal Power Act, PUHCA, and other FERC orders must be repealed or radically reformed if competition is to take hold. Clearly, only the federal government can initiate this task. Furthermore, only federal action can solve the problems posed by the PMAs and TVA.

</UL>
<P>
<B>The Eight Guiding Principles for Federal Action</B>

<P>
<DD>
The need for federal action is obvious from the economic as well as the policy standpoint. But not all deregulatory plans are equal. Any deregulatory legislation crafted by Congress should be based on clear, free market-oriented principles that will complete the job of electricity liberalization as rapidly as possible. The following principles and strategies provide Congress with a useful blueprint for electricity reform legislation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>1. Congress immediately should eliminate all barriers to entry into the electricity market and all impediments on commerce and competition within the interstate electricity sector. </B> This is most important first step toward the creation of a free market in electricity. Congressional action should include repeal of the Federal Power Act and the PUHCA. Beyond these statutes, almost all previous FERC orders must be overturned and more recent statutes such as the PURPA and the EPAct of 1992 must be superseded by a more deregulatory-minded strategy, as outlined below. All regulations involving rate-setting or price controls affecting the utility companies must end as utilities enter a competitive marketplace. Finally, exclusive state franchising must end, and the "state action doctrine" that allows states to ignore federal antitrust laws and establish state-sanctioned monopolies also must be terminated.

<P>
<B>2. Efforts must be taken to de-monopolize the industry through mandatory vertical disaggregation of industry segments, or through an open access plan that allows competition in the transmission grid.</B> Traditionally, individual generation companies have been granted regional monopolies over transmission and distribution lines. Government action is needed to ensure other generating companies can gain access to commercial and residential electricity customers served by those lines. Mandatory vertical disaggregation would cause the immediate creation of a competitive electricity market because no single utility would be allowed to own both generation or transmission/distribution facilities in a given region. Utilities opting to sell their generation assets and hold on to their transmission facilities would have an immediate incentive to solicit customers and generate profits. On the generation side, disaggregation would mean no single company would be granted preferential access to transmission networks. All firms would compete on equal terms for customer allegiance. Once vertical disaggregation is complete, other regulations should be repealed to free up the competitive market environment.
<P>
The only foreseeable problem in divestiture may arise when a firm wants to reintegrate its generation and transmission facilities. A simple interim prohibition on reintegration of past facilities could be put in place as competition takes hold, and then phased out a few years later when multiple firms have the ability to counter such a move on their own in the free market through mergers and acquisitions. Furthermore, newly divested firms should be allowed and encouraged to build new generation or transmission facilities if they so desire.

<P>
In recent years, a handful of states have put plans on the table for opening their electricity transmission grids to competition. At the heart of this philosophy lies the belief that new rivals will emerge to serve consumers if they have the ability to do so through the existing power transmission lines, just as competitors share networks in the telecommunications, railroad, and airline industries. Congress could encourage the continuation of these open access efforts in the states, and it should encourage reluctant states to pursue similar reforms to harmonize the national marketplace.

<P>
Although on the surface the open access solution seems like easier medicine to swallow, in reality open access and interconnection policies are difficult to enforce and they are more likely to face regulatory delay and legal battles. The separation of monopolistic transmission facilities from incumbent generation companies is only <I>functional separation</I> under open access, whereas it becomes <I>complete structural separation</I> under mandatory vertical disaggregation. Although large incumbent utilities that continue to own transmission facilities are required to open their networks to competitors on non-discriminatory terms, it is quite difficult to enforce. Regulators must pay constant attention to interconnection terms to ensure that all competitors are granted access to customers on fair terms.

<P>
Recent efforts to carry out open access plans in the telecommunications industry resulted in costly legal battles and federal court intervention. This has delayed the opening of communications facilities to competition. In addition, open access may discourage the construction of new transmission/distribution networks since competitors could always demand access to existing networks. Under a vertical disaggregation policy, companies would be more likely to consider building new networks if they felt it was possible to gain a competitive advantage over independent transmission/distribution companies.

<P>
Open access must be considered the second-best solution behind mandatory vertical integration because the latter policy would be more likely to advance industry competition in the short term without the regulatory headaches and legal hang-ups likely to accompany open access. Still, if mandatory vertical disaggregation proves too difficult to sell politically, an open access solution would be worth pursuing to ensure competition can take hold in this industry at some point in the near future. If open access rules are imposed, however, it is important that they are as limited in scope as possible and designed to sunset within five to seven years. Congress must not replace one complex, burdensome regulatory regime with another.

<P>
Congress must work in conjunction with the states when devising de-monopolization strategies. Congress should consider itself more of a backstop in this process because many states are already moving forward with their own reform initiatives. States should be encouraged to take the lead and continue this process without cumbersome federal intervention. Later, as the reform process unfolds state by state, federal action should supplement and equalize state initiatives by encouraging straggling states to move forward while simultaneously monitoring the potential uncompetitive activities of "bad actor" states seeking to protect monopolies within their borders. Optimally, a federal-state partnership or "competitive compact" will evolve out of this process that sees policymakers at both levels working together to smooth the transition to a competitive market as quickly as possible.

<P>
<B>3. Congress should place clearer guidelines in any bill governing stranded cost recovery; no state should be able to use this process to hinder interstate commerce by favoring incumbent producers.</B> The inevitable debate over stranded cost recovery has the potential of sinking the entire reform effort, but it does not have to. There is a sensible balance that can be struck to ensure reform moves forward and utilities with genuine uneconomic, mandated investments are compensated appropriately.

<P>
Federal legislators and regulators should formulate a pro-competitive stranded cost recovery mechanism that gives broad authority to the states to define the level of stranded cost recovery -- because state officials were the parties most responsible for any uneconomic investments or activities mandated on investment in the first place. The federal role in this process would be minimal; it would focus on ensuring that the stranded cost recovery mechanisms used by the states did not discourage competitive forces from taking root. Federal guidelines should be established that outline the utility investments that are "clearly recoverable" or "clearly unrecoverable."  For example, "clearly recoverable" investments that could be considered worthy of compensation might include costs incurred by utilities to comply with federal mandates under the PURPA, or generation facilities that were built at the explicit request of regulators, despite reluctance by the utility. "Clearly unrecoverable" investments, on the other hand, might include ridiculous claims by utilities whose routine business costs such as renovations, remodeling, or maintenance are worthy of compensation by competitors. If states were to allow recovery on these types of items, it would be clear they were attempting to grant utilities under their jurisdiction an unfair advantage over competitors, which would constitute an unjustifiable burden on commerce.

<P>
There will be many stranded cost claims that lie between the extremes of what the federal government would outline as "clearly recoverable" and "clearly unrecoverable."  This gray zone should be left to the discretion of the states. The only other general prohibitions or guidelines that could be justified from the federal level would involve the overall level of compensation provided to any single utility and the method of stranded cost compensation imposed by state regulators. Concerning the latter, it would be sensible for federal policy makers to outline mechanisms that would recover the costs associated with stranded cost recovery fairly in a nondiscriminatory, pro-competitive fashion, and those that would not. Federal guidelines also should warn the states that stranded cost recovery of excessive amounts will be considered an anti-competitive attempt to restrict entry, which will be prohibited. For example, if a given state required new rivals to incur outrageously excessive costs in stranded cost compensation to incumbent utilities via a discriminatory interconnection charge, this could serve as an indication that the state was acting to protect the incumbent utility from competition and would be disallowed. If vertical disaggregation/divestiture is pursued by federal policy makers instead of open access, this issue may be moot, however, because the sale of facilities by a monopolistic utility would likely provide them with ample returns on whichever set of assets they chose to divest.

<P>
Under any scenario, it is important that federal policy makers not allow the heated stranded cost debate to derail the deregulatory process. Furthermore, legislators should not allow monopolistic utilities to demand hefty amounts of stranded cost compensation as quid pro quo for opening the transmission network to competition. If they succeed in doing so, the deregulatory process will actually prove counterproductive.
<P>

<B>4. Congress must take steps to privatize the Power Marketing Administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority, and to close down the Rural Utilities Service.</B> Privatization of the TVA and PMAs would benefit Americans in their capacity both as taxpayers and electricity consumers. Privatizing these entities will generate between $15 billion and $30 billion for the federal Treasury, and end $7 billion to $10 billion in annual subsidies. As a consequence, competition would have a better chance of taking hold in areas traditionally controlled by monopolistic federal power providers.
<P>

Privatization does not have to be completed all at once. Congress can put forward a structured privatization program that gradually divests assets in whatever fashion they consider the most politically sensible. Since some TVA and PMA employees may find the notion of going private somewhat uncomfortable, Congress can assuage their fears by offering them stock shares in the newly privatized power company. And if power consumers in the regions traditionally served by the TVA or PMAs fear rate shock due to privatization, temporary price freezes can be established to ensure a gradual balancing of rates. Electricity consumers could be given the option of purchasing stock shares themselves in a general auction and perhaps even be allowed to pay for the stock purchase through installment payments on their monthly electric bills. It would be wise for policymakers to break the public power entities into distinct segments (generation/transmission/distribution) before they are privatized. This would help create a more competitive setting in markets traditionally served by these entities, and it may help bring in higher revenues through multiple auctions.
<P>
Many creative privatization options and alternatives exist that will ensure a smooth and beneficial transition.<SUP>51</SUP>  As policymakers institute this plan, they should abolish the Rural Utilities Service, whose job was finished long ago.
<P>

<B>5. Congress should not mandate the use of any particular sources of energy, including renewable energy.</B> Congress will be tempted, and perhaps even threatened, by environmental groups and the Clinton Administration to load the deregulatory legislation with environmental mandates and programs as the price of their support for any bill. It will be a serious mistake to cave into these threats and demands. Electricity deregulation itself will be the most environmentally friendly action Congress can undertake. As journalist Jonathan Marshall notes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Competition will force electricity suppliers to price according to true marginal cost, rather than average cost, and this will encourage customers to control their energy demand more precisely. Competition will also give power companies an incentive to sell more than just electrons, including energy services like efficient lighting, innovative building design and heating, more informative metering, and energy controls that respond to changing prices.<SUP>52</SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Furthermore, mandating that private companies use specific alternative technologies that have not yet proved themselves feasible on the open market could set back the original goals of deregulatory legislation. If solar, wind, hydrothermal, or other forms of alternative power production prove sustainable in the open market, then companies will adopt those means of production as their own. Prematurely mandating their use, however, could prove uneconomical to companies struggling to compete in newly liberalized markets, and it could drive up consumer prices significantly just as benefits of competition begin to take hold. It makes no sense for policymakers to argue boldly that they trust the market to provide better service and prices to consumers only to turn around and contend the market will fail to serve Americans better in terms of safer, more environmentally friendly alternatives.

<P>
<B>6. Congress should avoid including new mandates, exclusions, or pork-barrel spending in the final bill.</B> Beyond the predictable push by environmental special interests to insert unnecessary mandates and programs into deregulatory legislation, many policymakers may feel tempted to insert programs or policies that are favorable to narrow interests in their home states. But carving out special exemptions to deregulation quickly will become a zero-sum game because if there are enough exemptions or new mandates added, they will effectively nullify any beneficial effects generated through liberalization.
<P>

Before debate over legislation begins, legislators should make a pact with one another that they will make every effort to keep bills clean of unnecessary spending, bureaucracy, and exemptions. If they fail to reach such an agreement, not only will the legislation fail to produce the results they desire, but it may put final passage of any measure in jeopardy -- because such insertions or amendments undoubtedly will prolong committee and floor debate.

<P>
<B>7. Congress should avoid costly new federal universal service mandates or programs.</B> Federal policy makers will be justifiably concerned about how well the least fortunate members of society are served in the new electricity environment. Clearly, electric power is an essential good in the lives or all Americans regardless of their lifestyle or income. Therefore, legislators will be tempted to greatly expand programs such as the Rural Utilities Service or to impose new universal service mandates or programs on private companies. This would be highly unfortunate and counterproductive. Almost all Americans have electricity lines running to their homes, so there is no need for grand new subsidies or programs that pretend an imaginary infrastructure crisis exists in the United States requiring big government solutions. Such efforts would burden the newly liberalized companies with unworkable and costly mandates that would actually hinder their efforts to compete effectively and serve customers better.
<P>

Furthermore, legislators should not buy into the outdated, New Deal-era notion that rural America will require preferential treatment or a special subsidy program if deregulation moves forward. Geography no longer can serve as a good gauge of which Americans are most in need of assistance. Rural America is now better developed than most of urban America and is likely to be in a much better position to reap the rewards of a competitive electric industry.
<P>

Yet, if there is a justifiable need to ensure the poorest Americans do not go without electricity, Congress, or state and local officials, can create targeted, means-tested programs. In-state officials can better identify at-risk households. Under no circumstance is it justifiable to mandate that private companies provide an array of services to consumers without being compensated for such actions. It is vital that government officials are honest about how much it costs to provide assistance, and then appropriate those funds from general tax revenues at the state or local level, just as they would with any other entitlement program. Voucher programs are best suited to this task. With the rise of a competitive marketplace, however, it is unlikely any such programs will be needed in the future as the price of electricity falls and companies create superior means of serving disadvantaged customers.
<P>

<B>8. Congress should establish a timetable to abolish the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy.</B> Once a pro-competition policy has been put into effect nationwide, there will be little remaining need for federal intervention or regulation of the electricity marketplace. As part of their plans to deregulate, policymakers should include a strategy and timetable for the eventual elimination of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the entire Department of Energy. DOE tasks that are deemed essential for national security purposes should be transferred to the Department of Defense, where they rightly belong. Federal labs should be privatized. As for the FERC, its remaining regulatory functions can be taken over by the states eventually or sunset outright over time. This process could be accomplished within five to ten years.

<B>CONCLUSION</B>

<P>
<DD>
Although nearly every other economic sector of the U.S. economy has undergone significant deregulation, legislators have yet to tear down the regulatory walls that surround what is commonly referred to as "America's last regulated monopoly" -- the electricity market. With the success of deregulation in aviation, trucking, natural gas, and telecommunications, ample evidence exists warranting the embrace of free markets for electricity. Consumers of electricity -- both industrial and residential--stand to reap rich rewards from competition in this market, just as they have in other deregulated industries. Furthermore, with numerous countries across the globe liberalizing their electricity sectors, Congress must take action soon to ensure U.S. electric firms retain and enhance their competitive international advantages in this field. The regulated monopoly model that has governed this industry throughout this century is hopelessly broken and cannot be fixed. It must be replaced completely and wholeheartedly by an unfettered free market in which consumers, not regulators, make the decisions.

<A NAME="terms">
<P>
<B>Key Electricity Terms</B><SUP>53</SUP>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Access:</B> The ability to use transmission/distribution facilities that are owned or controlled by a third party, usually a monopolistic investor-owned utility.
<P>
<B>Access charges:</B> Fees charged by the owner of a transmission/distribution network to independent producers that want to gain access to the grid.

<P>
<B>Ancillary services:</B> Services provided by a utility in conjunction with transmission service that ensure generation services are delivered in a safe and effective manner.

<P>
<P>
<B>APPA:</B> The American Public Power Association, a national association representing municipally owned and other publicly owned electric utilities.

<P>
<B>Avoided cost:</B> Costs that an electric utility avoids by purchasing power from an independent producer rather than building a new generation facility itself. Under PUHCA and subsequent statutes and regulations, federal officials required monopolistic utilities to purchase power from qualifying independent generators for no more than the avoided cost it would cost them.

<P>
<B>Baseload capacity:</B> The minimum amount of electric generating capacity required for the steady, around-the-clock provision of power.

<P>
<B>Bilateral contracts:</B> Detailed contracts between producers and buyers of electric power to deliver a given amount of electricity at a given time according to pre-established specifications.

<P>
<B>Bundling:</B> The combination of generation, transmission, and distribution services into a packaged whole that is sold at a single rate to customers. (Also see "Unbundling.")

<P>
<B>Cogeneration:</B> The simultaneous production of electricity and thermal energy. Cogenerators are considered qualifying facilities under the PURPA and thereby are able to sell their power at avoided cost to investor-owned utilities.

<P>
<B>Co-op: </B> Industry jargon for a cooperative electric utility. A co-op is a common form of business organization owned and operated by a group of individuals, businesses, and organizations in similar occupations. Co-ops are located primarily in rural areas and are exempt from federal, state, and local taxes. Most co-ops received their initial funding from the Rural Electrification Administration.

<P>
<B>Demand side management (DSM):</B> Entails efforts of utilities to encourage conservation of electricity usage, including demand and consumption patterns. Many of these demand/load management measures have been required, or strongly encouraged, by regulators.

<P>
<B>Disco:</B> Industry jargon for distribution facilities or companies engaged primarily in the provision of distribution service.

<P>
<B>Distribution facilities:</B> Equipment used to deliver electric power at lower voltages from the transmission system to the final user. Although considered a distinct segment of the market, distribution facilities generally can be grouped with transmission facilities because these assets perform a similar function that is wholly distinct from generating facilities.

<P>
<B>Divestiture:</B> The process of requiring monopolistic utilities to spin off one segment of their business; this is done to ensure that uncompetitive advantages created by former government actions are removed so that competition can develop. Divestiture, or vertical disaggregation, serves as a viable alternative to open access to de-monopolize the industry.

<P>
<B>EEI:</B> The Edison Electric Institute, a national association representing the majority of America's investor-owned utilities. EEI members produce almost 80 percent of all the electricity produced annually.

<P>
<B>ELCON:</B> Acronym for the Electricity Consumers Resource Council, the national trade association that represents America's largest industrial and commercial electricity customers. ELCON's members consume roughly 5 percent of all electricity consumed in the United States.

<P>
<B>Energy brokers:</B> Companies that act as middlemen in an electronic marketplace in which electric power is priced, purchased, and traded. Energy brokerage works like other commodities that are traded in major markets, such as commodity futures markets.

<P>
<B>EPAct:</B> The Energy Power Act of 1992 allowed the FERC to introduce greater elements of competition in electric generation by ordering monopolistic utilities to provide access for a new category of power producers known as exempt wholesale generators, or "EWGs," to any other generation company along the transmission grid. These are exclusively wholesale transactions, however; retail contracts and transactions between independent producers and EWGs are not authorized under the EPAct.

<P>
<B>EWGs:</B> Exempt Wholesale Generators were created under the Energy Power Act of 1992 and are exempt from the PUHCA. They sell power exclusively to other power producers in the wholesale market and, therefore, still are not allowed to sell the power they produce directly to electricity customers.

<P>
<B>FERC:</B> The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission replaced the Federal Power Commission as the agency responsible for regulating the price, terms, and conditions of transactions in the U.S. wholesale electricity market, and any other electricity issues that are interstate in nature. Intrastate electricity issues and retail electric transactions are regulated primarily by state public utility commissions (PUCs).

<P>
<B>FERC orders No. 888 and No. 889:</B> FERC regulations issued in 1996 that implemented the wholesale access and competition required under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The orders required the unbundling of service components by monopolistic utilities, established a computer-based information sharing system known as OASIS to allow electricity marketers and brokers to conduct transactions more efficiently, and required further actions to identify potentially stranded costs that could arise due to these requirements.

<P>
<B>FPA:</B> The Federal Power Act of 1935, which created the FERC's predecessor, the Federal Power Commission, and granted it the power to regulate the interstate electricity transactions that could not be controlled by any single state PUC. The Federal Power Act was passed in conjunction with the PURPA.

<P>
<B>Genco:</B> Industry jargon for generation facilities, or companies that are primarily involved in the generation of electric power.
<P>
<B>Generation facilities:</B> The equipment and assets used to convert various forms of energy input into electrical power. Generating facilities are wholly distinct from transmission and distribution facilities and are considered highly competitive in their own right.

<P>
<B>Grid:</B> Industry jargon referring to the interconnected power lines that constitute the transmission/distribution networks of the United States.

<P>
<B>IPP:</B> An independent power producer; a generating company that produces electric power but does not operate as an integrated utility because it has no transmission or distribution facilities. IPPs proliferated rapidly after the passage of the PURPA because the statute required monopolistic utilities to purchase IPP-producer power. IPPs are also commonly referred to as non-utility generators (NUGs).

<P>
<B>IOU:</B> Investor-owned utilities are shareholder-owned, publicly traded corporations that are taxed like other private businesses but regulated strictly by both state and federal officials. IOUs were granted regional monopolies via express government actions that simultaneously protected their service territory from competition while guaranteeing their profits and ensuring them against any market or financial risk. IOUs are collectively represented by the Edison Electric Institute.

<P>
<B>kWh:</B> Acronym for kilowatt hour, the most common unit of measure within the electric industry. Consumers are charged in cents per kilowatt hour.

<P>
<B>Load:</B> The aggregate amount of power demanded by electricity consumers at any given time and then placed on the grid by generating companies to fulfill that demand.

<P>
<B>Muni:</B> Industry jargon for a municipally owned electric utility. Municipalities are electric utilities owned and operated by a municipal government to serve citizens within their geographic boundaries. They typically consist of a generating plant or plants and a short-haul distribution system.

<P>
<B>NARUC:</B> The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners represents the collective interests of state and local regulators across America.

<P>
<B>Open access:</B> A deregulatory model that requires monopolistic utilities to allow rivals access to the transmission and distribution facilities they possess on non-discriminatory terms at cost-based rates. Many legislators and regulators view open access as the preferred method of de-monopolizing the industry and ensuring greater competition in the electric market.

<P>
<B>Power pools/PoolCo:</B> Centralized, independent organizations that would be responsible for purchasing all wholesale electric power in a given service region and then reselling power to final customers. Power pools would act as a short-term spot market where buyers and sellers could conduct electricity transactions. Many regulators argue PoolCo solutions represent the optimal method of coordinating operations and improving system reliability in the future. PoolCo critics argue the system would interfere with many existing and future contractual obligations and require too much on-going, centralized regulatory oversight.

<P>
<B>Power marketer:</B> Any middleman firm that buys and resells power but does not own its own generating or transmission facilities. Power marketers must file with the FERC to conduct business because they resell power across state boundaries.

<P>
<B>PMAs:</B> Five Power Marketing Administrations are operated by the Department of Energy. PMAs sell electricity at the wholesale level that is generated by approximately 130 power plants (mostly dams) built and maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. The five PMAs are Alaska, Bonneville, Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western Area. The Alaska PMA is scheduled to be privatized first.

<P>
<B>PUHCA:</B> The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 federalized the regulation of multi-state utility holding companies after they grew beyond the reach of state regulators. The PUHCA requires holding companies that own or control more than 10 percent of another utility to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and provide the agency with detailed records of their financial transactions and holdings. The law restricts merger and acquisition activity, curtails investment in non-utility industries, prohibits intercompany loans, and regulates other financial transactions strictly (such as the issuance of new securities). The statute also constrains and even narrows the powers of these holding companies, allowing them to control utilities essentially only within a given state, which maximizes state control -- a primary objective of the act. Finally, the law created a regulatory distinction between "registered" holding companies and "exempt" holding companies. To qualify for an exemption from PUHCA, a holding company must be primarily intrastate in geographic scope and limited in business operations to the provision of a basic utility service. Not surprisingly, this has generally discouraged firms from expanding operations; only 14 "registered" holding companies currently exist in the United States. Over 150 "exempt" holding companies exist that exclusively serve customers within their own states. 

<P>
<B> PURPA:</B> The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 was passed in the 1970s during the energy crisis to encourage the use of alternative energies and conservation techniques. It designated certain small IPPs as qualifying facilities (QFs) under the law. As a QF, alternative energy producers earned exemptions from existing laws and were able to sell electricity wholesale to utilities. This had the beneficial, albeit unintended, effect of proving competition was feasible within the industry because independent generation proliferated over time.

<P>
<B>PUC:</B> The Public Utilities Commission regulates intrastate electricity transactions and retail electric service. Although the various PUCs work independently of the FERC, they still must abide by FERC guidelines as established by various federal statutes. They are also commonly known as Public Service Commissions or PSCs.

<P>
<B>QF:</B> Industry jargon for a "qualifying facility" under the PURPA. If an independent power producer is granted QF status from the FERC, it is then allowed to sell its power to IOUs at avoided cost and is exempted from most federal regulations that evolved from the PUHCA. Qualifying facilities generally produce electricity via cogeneration or renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, or hydro-power.

<P>
<B>REA/RUS:</B> The Rural Electrification Administration (now called the Rural Utilities Service or RUS) was created in 1936 to electrify underdeveloped rural areas by providing subsidized loans and grants to rural electric cooperatives.

<P>
<B>Regulatory compact:</B> Theory advocated by most regulators and electric utility companies that argues that in exchange for the construction and operation of a monopolistic, regional electrical system, utilities would have their profitability and overall financial viability guaranteed. The theory will be referred to often in the upcoming deregulatory debates; utilities will argue that because they have been guaranteed traditionally a fair return on any investment they made, assets or facilities that become uneconomic or "stranded" due to the rise of competition should be compensated for by competitors or captive ratepayers.

<P>
<B>Retail wheeling:</B> Non-utility generating companies that do not own transmission facilities sell the electricity they produce directly to residential, industrial, and commercial consumers. Currently wholesale wheeling is mandated under federal law.

<P>
<B>Stranded benefits:</B> Benefits many regulators and environmental groups argue will be lost with the move to competition in electricity: namely, mandated environmental conservation programs or those on the overall network integrity and reliability. Proponents of competition argue such benefits would be augmented in new ways if competition were allowed.

<P>
<B>Stranded costs:</B> Assets owned by utilities that supposedly would become uneconomical in a competitive marketplace: for example, non-depreciated generating facilities or pre-established long-term contractual obligations.

<P>
<B>Transco:</B> Industry jargon for transmission facilities, or a company engaged almost exclusively in the provision of transmission service.

<P>
<B>Transmission facilities:</B> Equipment used to deliver electric power at higher voltages in bulk quantity, from generating facilities to local distribution facilities, for final retail use. Industry officials often include distribution facilities with transmission facilities, however, when discussing transmission services relative to generation services.

<P>
<B>Unbundling:</B> The separation of the various components of electricity production, shipment, and service in order to introduce greater elements of competition to these segments of the industry. "Functional unbundling" would require monopolistic utilities to provide access to their transmission and distribution network in exchange for an access fee. "Structural unbundling" would require complete vertical disaggregation such that monopolistic utilities would be required to divest either their generation assets or their transmission/distribution assets.

<P>
<B>Wheeling:</B> The transmission of electric power by a utility that does not own or directly use the power it is transmitting.

Costello and Graniere went on to say: "Further, distributional effects have not been dramatic... shareholders have not gotten rich at the expense of consumers. In fact, in most instances, consumers have gained much more from deregulation than shareholders. Yet, shareholders have been able to earn adequate rates of return, attributed in part to the greater freedoms firms have enjoyed since deregulation." Other experts also argue that past deregulatory experiments in other fields foreshadow the beneficial changes reform could bring to the electricity market.

<LI>     <I>Ibid.</I> The validity of the natural monopoly theory has been questioned by numerous economists and historians. As economist James R. Nelson noted in 1966, "One of the most unfortunate phrases ever introduced into law or economics was the phrase 'natural monopoly.'  Every monopoly is a product of public policy. No present monopoly, public or private, can be traced back through history in a pure form. ' [N]atural monopolies' in fact originated in response to a belief that some goal, or goals, of public policy would be advanced by encouraging or permitting a monopoly to be formed, and discouraging or forbidding future competition with this monopoly." James R. Nelson, "The Role of Competition in Regulated Industries," <I>The Antitrust Bulletin</I>, Vol. 11, No. 1 & 2 (1966), p. 3. Thomas Hazlett, professor of economics at the University of California-Davis, has argued: "The economists' analysis of the inefficiency of unregulated natural monopoly markets did not spring from a scientific or particularly scholarly research program but in response to 'a growing clamor for more government.'  Indeed many of the early natural monopoly writers had attacked the problem because of personal ideological agendas; their politics preceded their studies." Thomas Hazlett, "The Curious Evolution of Natural Monopoly Theory," in <I>Unnatural Monopolies: The Case for Deregulating Public Utilities</I>, ed. Robert W. Poole, Jr. (Lexington, Mass.: Lexington Books, 1985), p. 21. Also see Harold Demsetz, "Why Regulate Utilities?" <I>Journal of Law and Economics</I>, Vol. 11 (April 1968), pp. 55-65.

<LI>     Although Massachusetts was the first state to establish a state regulatory commission in 1887, not until 1905 (New York) and 1907 (Wisconsin) was the modern incarnation of the state regulatory commission born. The charters of these bodies (especially the Wisconsin PUC) would provide the model for states across the nation because almost all states creating PUCs after 1907 endowed them with similar powers: the right to require "certificates of convenience and necessity" or operating permits for all new utilities to initiate service; the authority to regulate the rates of service; and the power to control the issuance of securities by regulated public utilities. See Gregg A. Jarrell, "The Demand for State Regulation of the Electric Utility Industry," <I>The Journal of Law and Economics</I>, Vol. 21, No. 2 (October 1978), pp. 270-71. Thus, 1905 makes the beginning of the era of state regulatory commission management of the electric industry.

Primeaux argues, "Public utility commissions are powerful influences, and empirical data show that their hostility toward direct competition tends to undermine its continued existence in actual markets."

The sharply increasing economies of scale in generation and long-distance transmission at high voltages counselled integration of the industry over wider and wider areas. Largely because of the traditional, localized structure of the industry, a tradition intensified by the unhappy experience with the holding companies and by the 1935 Act, the necessary coordination was achieved principally by voluntary collaboration among operating companies. The collaboration fell considerably short of achieving the full possible advantages of complete integration, and particularly the integrated planning of investment." <I>Ibid</I>., p. 73. Kahn goes on to note that the resulting loss of scale economies that resulted from the PUHCA's restrictive guidelines simultaneously raised the overall cost of power and discouraged technological progress within the industry.

<LI>    Specifically, prohibitions on diversification into other lines of business under the Act, the important determination of "exempt" versus "registered" under the law, and other sections of the PUHCA compelling increased SEC oversight and filing requirements could all serve generally to discourage restructuring and expansion efforts. It is also worth noting that these PUHCA provisions might serve to discourage firms in other lines of business, such as telecommunications, from entering the electric industry as a potential competitors.

<title>Reforming Social Security: Understanding the Council's Proposals - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>REFORMING SOCIAL SECURITY: UNDERSTANDING THE COUNCIL'S PROPOSALS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a><br>
Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 128<br>
January 24, 1997<br>
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
<dd>
The Advisory Council on Social Security,<sup>1</sup> a statutory body chaired by Edward Gramlich, Dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, has finally released its much-anticipated <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/policy/adcouncil/toc.htm">report</a> on the future of the Social Security system, the nation's largest entitlement program.<sup>2</sup>  The report emphasizes the urgent need for Congress and the Clinton Administration to reform this financially troubled system and outlines three major options to improve the rate of return for future retirees, including private investment of Social Security funds.

<p>
<dd>
The best of the three options offered by the Advisory Council would change a portion of a worker's payroll tax into a personal savings account (PSA). This option would enable Americans to secure higher rates of return on their retirement contributions, energizing the economy while avoiding the dangers associated with proposals to allow the government to invest in private firms.

<p>
<dd>
Recent surveys, notes the Council in its historic report, indicate that "younger people have unprecedentedly low levels of confidence that Social Security benefits 'will be there' for them when they retire."  And while there is no consensus on exactly how the federal government could restore this confidence, each of the Council's three proposed options includes investing in the stock market as a tactic to secure the stability of the system and improve the rate of return for future retirees. The report states that:
<p><blockquote>
	[t]he Council is breaking new ground by dealing so explicitly with money's worth issues. It does so because of concerns about the equity from one generation to another. The Council feels that equity among generations is a serious issue and that it is important to improve the return on retirement saving for young people. All members of the Council favor the objective of improving the money's worth given by Social Security to younger generations. There are again differences on how this objective should be achieved.
</blockquote>
	<p>
<b>THE SIMILARITIES</b>

<p>
<dd>
In a number of other key areas, there is widespread agreement among the Council's members. They agree that:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Given mounting demographic and financial pressures, the Social Security system must be changed to guarantee solid future retirement benefits for the American people.</b> Unlike Medicare, which faces imminent bankruptcy, Social Security will enjoy income (including tax revenues and interest on accumulated funds) that exceeds expenses over the next few years. In 2012, however, the Social Security trust funds are expected to start paying out more in annual benefits than they collect in payroll and income taxes. Only the interest in the trust fund investments in government bonds, notes the Council, will keep the trust funds in a positive balance until 2020.
<p>
<dd>
Beginning in 2030, if Congress and the Administration do not make changes, it will not be possible to pay full benefits. In addition, the system will be burdened with the huge costs of the aging baby boomers. The Council notes that an additional 2.17 percent payroll tax increase would eliminate the long-term (75-year) deficit but adds that "Little support exists today for increasing payroll tax rates by 2.17 percentage points to provide long term balance."  Even raising taxes to bolster the program's finances would not improve the rate of return for workers  --  indeed, it would reduce it.
<p>
<dd>
To improve the system's financial stability, as well as to improve value for money, all three major plans offered by the Council would be changed from the current "pay as you go" financing system (in which taxes are collected to keep up with the payment of current benefits) to a system of "partial advanced funding," or "full funding" of a portion of Social Security, and, for the first time, a new investment in private-sector stock equities.
<p>
<li><b>Policymakers must move expeditiously to reform the system.</b> As the Council observes:
<p>
<blockquote>
	Expenditures are expected to rise rapidly once the baby boom generation begins retiring in little more than a decade. The difference between expected expenditures and expected revenues will grow in the future. Actions taken now to trim the growth in benefits, raise taxes or raise income in other ways could generate additional assets immediately. These additional assets could be invested (whether directly or through individual accounts) and these investments could raise money's worth ratios for younger workers.
</blockquote>
<p>
<dd>
(Technically, this ratio is the "present value" of expected benefits compared with the present value of expected taxes paid by the employee and the employer on behalf of the employee.)
<p>
<dd>
For Congress and the Administration to put off reforming Social Security merely guarantees that they will have to make even tougher and more politically unpopular choices in the future, either by cutting retirees' benefits or by raising taxes  --  each of which would mean less retirement return per payroll dollar. The Council's report notes that:
<p>
<blockquote>
	If the nation delays making any changes in Social Security for another 10 years, it would require a 25 percent reduction in benefits to rebalance the system without tax increases. By that time the baby boom generation will be on the cusp of its own retirement. The sooner the nation adopts changes and puts people on notice the less disruptive the changes will be.
</blockquote>
	<p>
<li><b>Workers should have "realistic" information on their retirement income.</b> The Council supports current Labor and Treasury Department efforts to increase the knowledge among American workers of the level of savings that will be required for them to have an "adequate retirement living standard" beyond what they are likely to get from Social Security. In spirit, this recommendation is compatible with a Heritage Foundation proposal that the Social Security Administration be required to give all Americans information on the rate of return from their Social Security contributions so that they can compare it with the rates paid by other retirement investments and options.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Social Security funds should be invested in the private market.</b> All of the Council's members favor changing the current "pay as you go" system for financing Social Security and propose changes to address the financial and structural problems of the system.
</ul>
<p>
<b>THE DIFFERENCES</b>

<p>
<dd>
The Council's members not only failed to reach consensus on a plan, but also were deeply divided on the structural details of how Social Security's future should be secured. Three different proposals emerged from the Council's deliberations.

<p>
<b>Proposal #1:  The Maintenance of Benefits.</b>
<p>
<dd>
Backed by Robert Ball and five other Council members, this option appears to be the most "conservative" because it retains the defined benefit and tax structure of the 1930s and deviates least from the status quo. This plan would increase Social Security trust fund revenues by including all state and local employees hired after 1997 in the program; by redirecting some taxes from the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund to the Old Age and Survivors Disability Insurance (OASDI) trust funds;<sup>4</sup> by increasing the computation base of benefits from 35 years to 38 years of work; and by increasing the payroll tax by 1.6 percent (in 2045) to assure long-term balance. Beyond this, the plan looks to private investment:
<p>
<blockquote>
	It envisions, after a period of study and evaluation, the possibility of a large scale investment of OASDI Trust Fund monies in the equity market in order to help bring the program into balance and greatly improve the money's worth ratios for young workers and future generations. The analyses in the report assumes [sic] that this change would be made within a few years.
</blockquote>
<p>
<dd>
Under this plan, the government would invest 40 percent of trust fund surpluses in private equities by 2014. The stated and "sole" purpose of this new investment, according to the report, is to get a higher return for Social Security than can be achieved simply by investing in government bonds, which are projected to generate a real return of 2.3 percent while stocks are projected to generate a real return of 7 percent. The trust fund investment would be overseen by an "investment policy board" nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. This board would select among "alternative passive market indexes" (such as the Standard & Poor's Index) and would choose portfolio managers on the basis of a competitive bid.
<p>
<b>Proposal #2: Publicly Held Individual Accounts.</b>

<p>
<dd>
Backed by Council Chairman Edward Gramlich and Marc Twinney, former Director of Pensions for the Ford Motor Company, this plan preserves Social Security's "existing protections" while giving "a boost" to the nation's retirement savings. Like the Ball proposal, the Gramlich proposal would enroll all state and local government employees hired after 1997 in the program and extend the base of the benefit computation from 35 to 38 years. Its distinguishing feature is the establishment of a mandatory defined contribution to an employee's account, funded by a new 1.6 percent employee payroll tax.

<p>
<dd>Under the plan, individuals would have "constrained choice" of how their tax money would be invested in these individual accounts, which would be excluded from the federal budget and converted to annuities when the individual elects to retire. Accounts also would be subjected to limited taxation, either when the monies in them are paid out in benefits or when they are on deposit. This plan is coupled with a gradual increase in the age of eligibility from 65 to 67 by the year 2011, as well as a limited taxation of benefits and a slower growth in basic Social Security benefits for middle- and upper-income beneficiaries.
<p>

<b>Proposal #3: Basic Benefits Plus Personal Security Accounts.</b>

<p>
<dd>In the third plan, all workers age 55 and older in 1998 would be covered under the existing (but slightly modified) Social Security system. For younger workers, however, a new federal retirement program relying even more heavily on private investments would be created. Backed by Sylvester Schieber of Watson Wyatt Worldwide Company, Carolyn Weaver of the American Enterprise Institute, and three other Council members, this plan would establish a two-tiered national retirement system. The first tier would be a "flat retirement" benefit for all "full career" workers, financed by 7.4 percent of the current Social Security payroll tax and adjusted for age and length of work. When fully phased in, it would provide a "floor of support" for retirees equal to, or greater than, the official poverty level and would be indexed to inflation. The second tier would be a new national system of personal savings accounts (PSAs), financed by allocating 5 percent of the existing payroll tax to retirement saving.

<p>
<dd>
This new tax allocation would apply to every worker under age 55 in 1998. The interest-bearing accounts would be owned personally by the beneficiaries and privately managed, much as individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) plans are today, but subject to "necessary regulatory restrictions to make sure they were invested in financial instruments widely available in financial markets and that they were held for retirement purposes."  Under this plan, individuals could begin withdrawing from their accounts at age 62, and any funds plus accumulated interest in these accounts could be included in their private estates.

<p>
<dd>Because of the magnitude of the existing Social Security system's future obligations -- the payment of future benefits to existing and future retirees -- moving to the new system necessarily involves a "transition cost."  This cost, according to the proposal's authors, is to be financed through government bonds and an additional 1.5 percent payroll tax over the next 72 years. Meanwhile, the retirement earnings test (the current practice of reducing Social Security benefits if a retired person earns a certain amount) would be abolished. In addition, like the Ball and Gramlich plans, the PSA plan calls for including state and local government employees in the system and changing the base of the benefit calculation to 38 working years. It also would continue to cover disability and survivors' insurance through the 7.4 percent payroll tax.
<p>

<b>OTHER AREAS OF AGREEMENT</b>

<p>
<dd>
While sharply divided on the details of structural change, the Council members agree on a number of key policy areas. These include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Maintaining the compulsory character of Social Security;
<li>Maintaining full cost of living adjustments;
<li> Opposing "conventional means testing" of Social Security;
<li> Solid financing for the system based on taxation and interest without drawing on general revenues from the federal Treasury;
<li> Protecting the benefits of low-wage employees;
<li> Creating incentives for Americans to work in their older years;
<li> Promoting private retirement plans;
<li> Changing rules to encourage workers to keep their retirement savings in tax-free accounts until retirement; and
<li> Easing limitations on the ability of private employers to fully fund their defined benefit pension plans.
</ul>
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>

<p>
<dd>
In attempting to preserve Social Security for future retirees, responsible officials in Washington can and must avoid a repeat performance of the ugly and polarizing politics surrounding Medicare. Members of Congress and officials of the Clinton Administration now possess the historic report of the Advisory Council on Social Security. They have an equally historic opportunity to build on this report by taking early and decisive action to reform the Social Security system and guarantee a solid retirement for the next generation of Americans.

<p>
<dd>A key element common to all three proposals presented in the Council's report is the need for policymakers to take advantage of the growing number of opportunities available to Americans to invest in private-sector stock options. From the standpoint of personal freedom, of the three options developed by members of the Advisory Council, the personal savings account (PSA) plan holds the greatest promise in terms of giving younger Americans greater control over their own retirement.

<p>
<dd>As future Heritage studies will indicate, reformers also can learn from the success of other programs that promote private investment, including the British and Chilean retirement systems and even Congress's own Federal Thrift Savings Program. In crafting Social Security reform, Congress should seek not only to secure guaranteed protection of the most vulnerable members of society, but also to assure younger working Americans the opportunity to get the best value for the money they are investing in their own futures.

<H1>A Place for Wild Wolves and a Reason to Kill Them</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
The timber wolf is an icon of the changing West.  It also offers a litmus test of the ability to think clearly.  Emotional baggage is chained to the species like a # 4 Victor, the trapper's tool of choice.  
</P>

<P>
Ranchers I've known for 30 years have come untrained, loudly sputtering at me for defending the wolf's place in the West.  And I've  brought environmentalists to tears when explaining that problem wolves should be, and will be, killed.  
</P>

<P>
Here is the key to understanding.  The wolf is programmed to kill large mammals but we want them to be selective.  By all means spare cows, horses, and sheep.
</P>

<P>
There's a place for the wolf.  In Yellowstone Park elk and bison numbers are exploding.  With numbers far exceeding carrying capacity, the ecology of Yellowstone is being dramatically simplified and degraded.  The wolf can help restore nature's dynamic balance where politics precludes responsible management by federal agencies. 
</P>

<P>
The wolf has been successfully reintroduced but its return must be actively managed--and not from afar.  Here's why.
</P>

<P>
The wolf is, at base, a cautious, indeed cowardly killing machine.  That is precisely why they are valuable additions to ecosystems like Yellowstone that are threatened by over browsing.  But a wolf in the wild has a hard life.  Most die before reaching five years of age.  
</P>

<P>
Handling big animals is inherently dangerous.  An injured cowboy or ferrier can usually make it to the ER.  Killing large hoofed animals with one's teeth, is much more risky.   And a wolf with teeth kicked out, ribs broken, or shoulder dislocated can't check into the vet clinic.  Hence, the selective sieve of time has produced wolves that attack the young, the weak, the sick, and those bogged down in snow.  
</P>
<A HREF="/free/Images/wolf.gif"><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/wolf.gif" WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="131"></A>
<P>
Brave wolves, those which attacked healthy animals on firm terrain, were less likely to survive and prosper then those more cautious.  We know that today's wolf descended from animals which avoided strong prey and sought out weakness.   Evolution produced an optimal mix of cowardice and ferociousness.
</P>

<P>
How does the above square with the claims by wolf advocates that there's no record wolves killing humans in the United States?  Quite well indeed.  The historical record indicates that wolf attacks on humans go down as weapons improve.   
</P>

<P>
Barry Lopez's respected book, <I>Of Wolves and Men</I> includes a conversation with an old Eskimo.  The wolf used to sometimes kill Eskimo.  "Now Nunamiut (an Eskimo) can reach out and kill Amaguk (the wolf) from a distance with a rifle.  Now Amaguk leaves Nunamiut alone."  In 1972 Erwin A. Bauer, a defender of wolves, observed;  "Wolves once had an unnerving habit of closing in around a man, under the right circumstances, often getting within a few yards or even a few feet.  And if these animals have killed few or no humans on this continent (since 1920), they have scared many half to death".  
</P>

<P>
In a book dealing with guard dogs, Mitchell Jones notes that "as man has become more formidable, the wolf has responded by becoming more reluctant to attack him".  The old wolf is gone, exterminated.  As Jones says, "The modern wolf is an animal with a radically different attitude toward man."  
</P>

<P>
So what happens when we "save the wolf"?   Montana ranchers are finding out.  They need a confirmed livestock kill before they can act.  In the Big Hole country, rancher Wayne Turner used a radio monitor to track two transplanted wolves, B7 and B11.  In one week he trailed them and found two carcasses of moose calves, a cow moose, a cow elk and a yearling heifer, the last a confirmed wolf kill by wildlife officials.  The wolves were darted with tranquilizers and relocated to an enclosure in Yellowstone Park.  Last week in the nearby Deer Lodge Valley, four wolves killed or maimed seven Angus cows.  The wolves were shot by federal agents.
</P>

<P>
This is not a happy ending but rather a preview.  Some conservation groups, specifically <A HREF="http://www.defenders.org">Defenders of Wildlife </A>, understand the costs which necessarily follow reintroduction. Defenders established a program to compensate stockmen for wolf kills and thereby reduce opposition to recovery efforts.  
</P>

<P>
Icons have different meanings to different people.  Newcomers to the West and urbanites insulated from rural Western traditions see the wolves as displaced natives who must be returned to the ecosystem.  Conversely, many native Westerners  view wolf reintroduction as the imposition of an alien culture.  To them, the wolf causes a whimsical waste of resources that threatens ranching and the traditional culture.  
</P>
<P>
Wolves have evolved as careful killers.  That's why we want them returned to wild ecosystems.  However, we want them to be discriminating in their preadation.  This requires that we permit stockmen to shoot wolves that kill livestock.  As wolf numbers increase, so will this problem.  It is irresponsible to pretend otherwise.

<center><h4>MRC Study Finds ABC Censored News At Peaceful Pro-Life Rallies</h4></center>
<center><h4>But Covered Many Liberal Protests; CBS, NBC Just As Bad</h4></center>

<BR><p>
Alexandria, Va. --- An explosion in downtown Washington, D.C. near Planned Parenthood's legislative headquarters this morning is guaranteed to spur a flurry of media coverage of the abortion issue. But this is the only time the news media will find it newsworthy to cover the pro-life cause. As a <I>Media Research Center</I> study has found, the news media, particularly ABC News, have actually censored peaceful pro-life demonstrations in favor of virtually any liberal group with a grievance.
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><b>"Our findings reveal that if you're a liberal activist with a cause your chances of getting prime network airtime on ABC News to air your grievance are terrific. But to literally millions and millions of pro-lifers, ABC's message is simple: 'You don't even exist,'" said Media Research Center Chairman Brent Bozell.</b></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<center><b>What ABC News Censored</b></center><p>
<BR>
<p>
One year ago today some 60,000 pro-lifers participated in the annual March For Life in Washington, and ABC News ignored the story in its entirety. In April, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops held a historic vigil outside the White House asking President Clinton to sign a ban on partial-birth abortion, and even though two American Cardinals participated, ABC again ignored the story.<p>
<BR>
<center><b>What ABC News Covered</b></center><p>
<BR>
<p>
<I>January 31</I>: ABC News anchor Peter Jennings announced "a major demonstration on behalf of the environment" by religious liberals opposed to Republican reforms of the Endangered Species Act. There was only one problem: according to the Environmental Information Center, which coordinated the activities of this coalition, there was no demonstration.<p>
<I>June 1:</I> The left-wing Children's Defense Fund's "Stand For Children"received six national stories on ABC's <I> World News Tonight</I>, five more on <I>Good Morning America</I>.<p>
<I>June 23: World News Tonight</I> did a full story on an animal rights march in Washington.<p>
<I>June 30:</I> ABC's Anderson Cooper offered a long, sympathetic portrait of an elderly couple of homosexual males marching in New York City's annual gay pride parade.<p>
<I>August 16:</I> ABC's Bill Blakemore filed a report on a Greenpeace protest in Washington state.<p>
<I>September 30:</I> Peter Jennings reported about an anti-gun group laying out 40,000 pairs of shoes on the Washington Mall as a "silent march" against guns.<p>
<I>October 12:</I> The AIDS quilt was laid on the Washington Mall, and <I>Good Morning America</I> aired three full segments - one of which led off the show. Minutes later, "another demonstration," the Latino march on Washington was also mentioned.<p>
<I>October 13: World News Tonight</I> ran a full story on the AIDS quilt.<p>
<I>December 1: World News Tonight</I> led with a story on "World AIDS Day" demonstrations.<p>
<BR>
<center><b>Other Noteworthy Findings</b></center>
<BR>
<I>Foreign Protests:</I> ABC found protests in foreign countries more important than Pro-Life demonstrations here, running full stories on <I> World News Tonight</I> on French protests regarding deportations of Africans (August 17), a Belgian child molestation verdict (October 20), and beauty pageants in India (November 19).<p>
<I>CBS and NBC:</I> Both CBS and NBC devoted just 19 seconds of airtime each to the March For Life one year ago. CBS ran three stories on the "Stand For Children," NBC ran two full stories on the animal rights march.<p>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><b> "We know there will be thousands of Americans in Washington today peacefully protesting the slaughter of innocent preborn children, and the fact that they still turn out in huge numbers to protest 24 years after the supreme court's decision is more than newsworthy. One can only conclude the networks refusal to cover the pro-life movement is not ignorance, is not an oversight, it is censorship," Bozell said.</b></blockquote>.

<h2>Who Needs the SBA? </h2>
<b>By Stephen Glass</b>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>
Speaking last June at the White House Conference on Small Business, President Clinton praised the "leaner, more invigorated, more committed" Small Business Administration (SBA). The loan-guarantee program of this small federal agency, he said, is the best way to get venture capital into the hands of America's entrepreneurs. Nine months later, the SBA followed up with a report identifying the most "small-business-friendly" banks in the country. Among the nation's very best: First Capitol, in York, Pennsylvania. But a close look at First Capitol doesn't reveal how the federal government builds what Clinton called tomorrow's Intel, Apple, and FedEx. Instead it shows how banks can boost small businesses better <I>without</I> government help.<p>

</td></tr>

</tr>
</table>
<p>
<dd>	With three branches in central Pennsylvania, First Capitol has lent more than $50 million to local small businesses -- 15 percent of which are headed by women or minorities. Their loan default rate is a meager 1.5 percent. By contrast, the default rate on SBA loans in the area is 6.2 percent. Its default rate nationwide is even higher.<p>
<dd>	First Capitol's clients include high-tech startups, construction companies, retail franchises, and mom-and-pop grocers. Its loan officers write business plans for their clients and meet with the entrepreneurs monthly, if not weekly. All this made First Capitol the fastest-growing bank in the region, boosting assets 16-fold from $5 million to more than $90 million in just eight years.<p>
<dd>	Most remarkable, First Capitol refuses to get the SBA or any government agency to guarantee its loans. "Why should we?" asks Tom Capello, First Capitol's president. "We pick winners."<p>
<dd>	Since First Capitol was founded in 1988 with only a card table and a telephone in shared office space, it has specialized in loans to small businesses. Other banks had written off York as a Rust Belt city doomed to sputter as the local Caterpillar tractor factory laid off workers. So depressed were regional expectations that no new bank had opened in York in nearly 60 years. First Capitol's founders saw the changing labor market as an opportunity to make money investing in startups.<p><b>Character as Asset</b>
<p>
<dd>	Ever since Thom Anstadt was in grade school, he had worked in his family's downtown printing shop. Eventually he and his uncle took over the company. When desktop publishing transformed the industry in the late 1980s, Anstadt proposed that the firm seek a niche in high-quality color printing. His uncle balked at the change, so Anstadt quit the business to start Colorgraphics, Inc.<p>
<dd>	"Most banks are allergic to startups," Anstadt says. "We had nothing. No equipment. Just an idea." He drafted a proposal and visited countless banks. According to Anstadt's own proposal, Colorgraphics would lose money for at least one and a half years because of its high start-up costs. Most scoffed. It was a loan, some bankers said, that the SBA would never guarantee.<p>
<dd>	But First Capitol did. The now-profitable printing firm has 22 employees and $2 million in yearly revenues. It has not only met every loan payment, but it has borrowed three additional times to expand.<p>
<dd>	Anstadt's story is typical of First Capitol. York, according to a top city official, is having "a small-business renaissance because of that bank." How does First Capitol do it? By counting on character.<p>
<dd>	Unlike other banks, First Capitol doesn't get Washington to guarantee its loans. At other banks, if the small business fails, most of the lost money is reimbursed by the government. These banks make money just by making loans. First Capitol only makes money if the startups succeed. And First Capitol has found that the best way to predict a business's prospects is to evaluate the owner's honor. While his competitors talk about the "two C's" of lending (credit and collateral), Capello has added another: "character."<p>
<dd>	To this end, Tom Sauer, the bank's chief loan officer, personally reviews each application. He and his staff spend hours talking with applicants about their businesses. He even meets with their families to make sure they'll have the necessary emotional support.<p>
<dd>	Most important, Sauer was not trained as a banker. Before coming to First Capitol, he had managed a local munitions factory. Although Sauer modestly says that means he "won't bump into the machines" when he tours businesses, it also means he understands them. "The other [banks] I applied to just looked at my numbers," says a local grocer who got a loan from First Capitol. "That doesn't tell them much. [Sauer] would smell the fruit to make sure it was fresh. He walked the aisles. He knows what I'm about."<p>
<dd>	Ultimately, each loan applicant also meets with Capello. First Capitol has found that letting even the smallest applicants meet with the bank's president strengthens their commitment to meeting the payments.<p>
<dd>	It works. Since March 1994, more than three-fourths of the bank's loans have gone to small businesses. In that same period, the bank's stock has risen more than 60 percent. And, the trend is upward: Profits in the third quarter of 1996 were the best ever -- 48 percent better than 1995. First Capitol thrives, not in spite of their SBA-free policy, but because of it. The rigidity and bureaucracy of the SBA's textbook loans may  invite failure. For entrepreneurs like Patricia Cumor, failures cost jobs.<p><b>A Nimble Response</b>
<p>
<dd>	Six years ago, Cumor's company, First Capitol Insulation, needed a credit line. (Many local businesses are named "First Capitol" because York was the home of the Continental Congress.) As prices for labor and raw materials soared, she couldn't bill homebuilders for projects until they were completed -- a lag of four months or so.<p>
<dd>	Cumor called several of the region's biggest banks. Although her stellar credit history and client list virtually ensured repayment, the SBA couldn't accommodate her unorthodox loan. The banks rejected her application. She made plans to close her business, laying off two dozen employees. Somehow she heard of First Capitol Bank, which -- unrestricted by SBA guidelines -- extended her the credit. Cumor's company now employs 40 people.<p>
<dd>	Similarly, First Capitol supplied the seed money for a family-owned stationery store. Although profitable, its business is seasonal. Capello allows the stationer to skip payments during the summer and pay more in the busier winter. The SBA would have closed the store down after a few missed installments. "What we do is good business," explains Capello.<p>
<dd> 	The government's inflexibility is also reflected in the paperwork its loans require. If Cumor had secured an SBA loan, she would have spent days filling out more than 100 pages of forms. Once First Capitol approves a loan, the process takes minutes. In fact, one way that Capello keeps interest rates low (usually about 1 point over prime) is by cutting bureaucracy. He estimates that he would have to increase his loan staff by nearly 50 percent to handle all the government paperwork.<p>
<dd>	SBA loans also hamper small-business expansion. For most of his life, Bill Crone has collected rare coins. He bought a small, profitable coin shop from his father, but changing tastes and the popularity of baseball cards have eroded the industry. Collectible coins and coin-boards (a gambling device legal in most states for use by charities), on the other hand, were becoming more popular. So, Crone opened the First Capitol Mint to make gold and silver collectibles wholesale.<p>
<dd>	When Crone secured the rights to stamp famous coins like one honoring baseball hero Cal Ripken, the mint took off. Within weeks he had eight distributors. Weeks after that he had 15, then 22, including some in neighboring states. Every time he adds a distributor, Crone secures credit from First Capitol to buy the gold and silver.<p>
<dd>	Why not the SBA? It's too slow. Small businesses like Crone's can't compete if they have to rely on government. Under the SBA system, securing approval for each distributor might take up to two months. Crone says if it took that long, he'd lose the account. "If that were the case, I'd never have opened up," he adds. The loan-approval board of First Capitol, on the other hand, meets weekly, so applications are always approved within a few days. For one important account, Crone was even able to get approval within 72 hours. For First Capitol, prompt service is not just a nice touch, it's vital. Better service, Capello says, boosts profits by giving the bank a competitive edge.<p><b>Good for Minorities</b>
<p>
<dd>	Likewise, First Capitol proves skeptics wrong when they say the private sector will leave women and minorities behind. Businesses owned by members of these groups account for about 15 percent of the bank's loan portfolio -- 7 points higher than SBA-backed banks in the region. To Capello, it just makes good business sense. "These are the fastest growing areas of the market," he says. "We want to be in on them."<p>
<dd>	First Capitol's loans are also more likely to succeed. The bank's flexibility and emphasis on character rather than business experience pays off. In his free time, Capello sits on a local nonprofit lending organization that makes direct loans to minority-owned small businesses. Of the last 12 businesses that received loans, 11 have failed. At First Capitol, on the other hand, minority- and women-owned businesses fail at the same rate as those owned by white men. Even President Clinton has conceded that the SBA was holding small business back. Small businesses, he said, needed less paperwork and regulation to thrive. He's describing the private sector.

<title>January 21, 1996 Press Release</title>

<center><h2>MEDICAL MARIJUANA<br>
BLOWING SMOKE?</h2></center>

<p>

<b>RICHMOND, VA --</b> Family Research Council Senior Policy Analyst
Robert L. Maginnis testified Tuesday before the Virginia General
Assembly that no reliable evidence exists to support the idea
that so-called medical marijuana is either safe or effective.
Maginnis said the &quot;marijuana for medicine&quot; strategy
that the pro-legalization lobby has spent 25 years developing
is merely a ploy designed to undermine public resolve against
legalization.

<p>

Virginia's legislative hearing is one of several that will be
held around the country at the state level as the concept marijuana
for medical purposes gains nationwide attention.  Twenty-five
states currently have laws permitting the use of marijuana for
so-called medical purposes.

<p>

Maginnis said: &quot;The most frightening aspect of these laws
is the message they send to our children.  At a time when teens'
pot use is skyrocketing, continuing to officially label marijuana
as anything other than a dangerous drug is wrong.&quot;

<p>

Maginnis added:  &quot;Most doctors would never recommend smoking
tobacco to lose weight; foxclub plant for heart failure; or utrebark
for breast cancer.  These materials may contain chemicals with
therapeutic value for the affliction, but doctors would never
think to recommend smoking as a health therapy.  Pot is crude
and impure.  Using it for medicine is like offering a patient
pond water rather than bottled water.  It's bad medicine.&quot;

<p>

Maginnis concluded:  &quot;Laws permitting marijuana as medicine
are not compassionate but a bad practice.  We should never encourage
our doctors to recommend something that is harmful and addictive
when effective therapies are readily available.&quot;

<p>

<b>For more information or scientific studies that expose the
fallacy of so-called medical marijuana call the FRC Media office.

Bob Maginnis is available for interviews.</b>

<LI> George Will recently reprinted this colloquy on partial-birth abortion between Sens. Rick Santorum (R., Pa.) and Russ Feingold (D., Wisc.). Santorum: "My question is this:   . . . if that baby were delivered breech style and everything was delivered except for the head, and for some reason . . . that baby's head would slip out . . . would it then still be up to the doctor and the mother to decide whether to kill that baby?" Feingold: ". . . the standard of saying it has to be a determination, by a doctor, of health of the mother, is a sufficient standard that would apply to that situation . . ." Santorum: "That doesn't answer the question. Let's assume . . . the head is accidentally delivered. Would you allow the doctor to kill the baby?" Feingold: ". . . That is a question that should be answered by a doctor, and by the woman who receives the advice from the doctor." Later Santorum engaged Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.). Santorum: "If the baby was delivered accidentallythe head slipped outwould you allow the doctor to kill the baby?" Lautenberg: "I am not making the decision . . ." Santorum: "But that's what we are doing here, Senator; we are making decision." Lautenberg: "You are making decisions that say a doctor doesn't have" Santorum: "So two inches make the difference as to whether you'll answer that question?" Lautenberg: "No, what makes the difference is someone who has the knowledge and intelligence and experience making the decision . . ." Someone, obviously, who is not a pro-choice senator. Lucky for them there are no bans on partial thought.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

One of the most important lessons of Watergate is that the abuse
of presidential power is very dangerous.  That's why the latest
reports of the Clinton administration conducting politically-motivated
tax audits are so troubling.

<p>

The IRS is headed by Margaret Milner Richardson, a close friend
of Hillary Clinton.  Miss Richardson is conducting audits of several
high-profile conservative organizations.  Some of these groups
have been characterized as &quot;enemies&quot; by the White House.
What's really fishy about this is not a single comparable liberal
group is being audited.

<p>

Tax audits are intrusive; they drag out for months and cost hundreds
of thousands of dollars in legal fees.  They have the power to
destroy these groups, and they're an awesome weapon in silencing
political opponents.  But it's illegal for any administration
to use the IRS for political purposes.

<p>

That's why we are calling for a Congressional investigation of
the IRS's selection of targets for audit.  Using law enforcement
to punish political opponents is an intolerable abuse of power
in a free country.

<p>

<p>
<dd>	There is a story the late publisher Henry Regnery liked to tell about one of his first conversations with Russell Kirk, the founder of postwar American conservative thought and a native of Michigan. In 1952, Kirk submitted a major book manuscript to Regnery and suggested that it be titled The Conservative Rout. Regnery talked him out of it. That title seemed too gloomy, too fatalistic. What if conservative ideas made a comeback? Would not <I>The Conservative Mind</I> be a better title in the long run? And so it was.  <p>
<dd>
	Were Kirk and Regnery alive today, they might revisit the word "rout" -- and this time apply it instead to liberalism. Apologists for the most liberal ideals of FDR, JFK, and LBJ are in serious retreat on the eve of the 21st century.

<p>
<dd> 	Bill Clinton had enough liberal credentials to win the nomination (and renomination) of the Democratic party. But his re-election in 1996 can hardly be viewed as a victory for the left wing of his party. The Man from Hope remains at best a "plurality president," having failed to win a majority of votes in both 1992 and 1996. After Democrats finished off the champagne on Election Night last November, they were no doubt sobered by the realization that, beyond the Oval Office, the Democratic Party is now much weaker than it was in November 1992 when Bill Clinton was first elected. The composition of the nation's legislatures and governorships shows why: In 1997, there are 11 more GOP senators than in 1992, prior to Clinton's election. What's more, Americans returned a more conservative Senate to Washington than occupied that chamber during the last Congress. Not since the 1920s have so many Republicans filled the U.S. Senate. 
<p>
<dd> 	Americans expressed their confidence in most of the conservative freshmen from the Class of '94 by sending them back to the House. At press time, several elections were undecided, but this much is clear: Today there are about 50 more House Republicans than in 1992. Only twice since the onset of the New Deal (in 1947-49, during the 80th Congress, and during the last Congress) have there been more GOP representatives on Capitol Hill. <p>
<dd>	Today there are 14 more Republican governors than in 1992. More Americans are represented by Republican governors than ever before in our nation's history -- 192 million. That's 74 percent of the American people. In state senates, there are 172 more Republicans today than in 1992. And in the lower chambers of state legislatures, there are 228 more Republicans today than in 1992. These numbers suggest that a major realignment of American politics is underway. Even before the votes were counted, <I>New York Times</I> reporter R. W. Apple remarked, "No matter who wins the presidency on Tuesday, no matter who gains or loses control of Congress, the returns, like the conduct of candidates great and small these many months, will confirm the nation's drift to the right." <p>
<dd>	So what of President Clinton's re-election? Two factors helped the silver-tongued Arkansan retain control of the White House, and both have to do with the conservative temper of the 1990s. The first concerns Bill Clinton's political instincts and his skill as a campaigner. In response to the 1994 elections -- a debacle for liberal Democrats across the nation -- Clinton recast himself to fit the <I>Zeitgeist</I> and campaigned on the premise that "the era of Big Government is over." Sounding positively Reaganesque, he offered the most conservative rhetoric of any Democratic president this century. (One wonders whether Clinton has recently graced the walls of the Oval Office with portraits of Grover Cleveland and Martin Van Buren -- the only Democratic presidents in history who both preached and practiced the virtues of a limited federal government.)<p>
<dd>	With the help of consultant Dick Morris and a bevy of polls and focus groups, Clinton succeeded in marketing himself as a centrist considerably to the right of his liberal friends and his liberal past. He ran on such conservative themes as deficit-cutting, targeted tax cuts, job growth, welfare reform, school uniforms, youth curfews, and more cops on the street. An English observer recently mused, "If you imagine a president committed to a balanced budget, welfare reform, and a stronger death penalty, would you say conservatism was losing?" <p>
<dd>	The second factor has little to do with Bill Clinton himself, yet it played an enormous role in his re-election. Few commentators noticed, but the campaign themes of 1996 were determined largely by politics and policies in the states, where conservative ideas have long been ascendant. It was the achievements of the nation's 32 Republican governors and their legislatures, not those of the White House, that made a majority of Americans believe the nation was on the right track. Their record of reform helped Bill Clinton win re-election. The Man from Hope adroitly, if shamelessly, took credit for the many impressive accomplishments of GOP administrations from Albany to Sacramento, and from Lansing to Austin. <p><b>Cutting Taxes and Spending </b>
<p>
<dd> 	One of the critical debates before American voters in the 1990s has been the proper size and scope of government at every level. All sides have reached a consensus that government should serve citizens better, limit its role in society, and give taxpayers more value for their dollar. <p>
<dd>
 Quietly, without fanfare, Republican governors and legislatures beyond the glare of Washington politics have been balancing budgets, cutting taxes, and making government more responsive to the people. Over the past four years, while Bill Clinton has consistently refused to support the Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, every GOP governor has been submitting a balanced budget to his or her legislature on an annual basis. <p>
<dd>	In just one year, Connecticut governor John Rowland turned a $174-million deficit into a $74-million surplus. Ohio governor George V. Voinovich has held state spending to its lowest rate of growth in four decades, and turned a $1.5-billion deficit in 1991 into an $800-million surplus. Similarly, in Minnesota and Michigan, respectively, Governor Arne Carlson and I each inherited deficits of $1.8 billion. Governor Carlson not only erased that deficit; he turned it into a $824-million surplus for 1996. In Michigan, we transformed a $1.8-billion deficit into a surplus of more than $1 billion. Today Michigan's "rainy day" fund is among the largest in the nation. <p>
<dd>	At the same time they were submitting balanced budgets, most GOP governors and legislatures were -- guess what? -- cutting taxes. Liberal Democrats have ignored an overwhelming body of evidence that tax cuts help create new jobs and  fill the treasury at the same time. Yet the examples are legion. In recent years, many governors have seen significant growth in jobs after enacting significant tax cuts, including Massachusetts's William Weld, New Jersey's Christine Todd Whitman, Pennsylvania's Tom Ridge, Virginia's George Allen, Idaho's Phil Batt, and Arizona's Fife Symington.<p>
<dd>	Since 1991, Michigan has cut taxes more often than any other state -- 21 times. These 21 tax cuts have resulted in a savings of $6.5 billion to taxpayers. The average family of four has been able to keep $2,000 more in their wallets every year; it is they, not government bureaucrats, who get to choose whether to save or spend the money. <p>
<dd>	The economic results of these tax cuts have been nothing short of spectacular. They have helped create more than a half-million new jobs. Remember that Michigan used to be thought of as a Rust Belt state suffering high unemployment rates. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s -- in fact, for 192 months in a row -- our unemployment rate was consistently above the national average. By contrast, it has been at or below the national average for the past 34 consecutive months. As of this writing, Michigan's unemployment rate has been below 5 percent every month in 1996, while the U.S. rate has hovered above 5 percent. That makes Michigan's unemployment rate for 1996 the best since 1969. The Michigan experience shows that significant tax reductions do help cut the deficit, balance the budget, and turbocharge the economy. <p>
<dd>	Last September, the Cato Institute released a study that compared the 10 states that raised taxes the most during the 1990s with the 10 states that cut taxes the most. Just what were the economic and fiscal results of these "laboratories of democracy"? <p>
<dd>	The 10 tax-cutting states economically outperformed the 10 tax-hiking states. Measured in current dollars, the economies of the tax cutters grew by 33 percent from 1990 to 1995, while the economies of the tax hikers lagged behind, with 27 percent growth. More striking is the contrast in job growth. The top 10 tax-cutting states gained 1.84 million new jobs between 1990 and 1995, while the top 10 tax-hiking states created zero net new jobs over that same period. <p>
<p
<dd>
	Income for a family of four grew by $1,600 more in the tax-cutting states than the tax-hiking ones. The tax-cutting states have experienced more vigorous population growth in the 1990s: 7.4 percent, compared with just 4.2 percent average growth in the tax-hiking states. The tax-cutting states have not only balanced their budgets; but they also now enjoy a budget reserve that amounts on average to 7.1 percent of state expenditures. The tax-hiking states, by contrast, have a budget reserve on average of only 1.7 percent. As a result, Moody's bond ratings are higher for states that cut taxes than for states that raised them. <p>
<dd>	Expanding economies, robust job growth, rising personal income, vigorous population growth, historically large "rainy day" funds -- no wonder Clinton could claim that it looks like morning in America. But odds are that it is only dawning brightly if you live in a fiscally conservative state. Bill Clinton owes his re-election in part to the policies of these GOP governors. <p><b>Regulatory Reform</b>

<p>
<dd>
	The top tax-cutting states are doing relatively well, no doubt about it. But the United States is currently experiencing its slowest economic recovery this century. Bureaucratic strangulation is a major factor in the long-term slowdown of the national economy. In 1965, there were about 17,000 pages in the Federal Register. Just since 1992, the volume of federal rules and regulations has grown by 231,000 pages -- the most prodigious growth rate since Jimmy Carter. It appears that Messrs. Clinton and Gore are not so much reinventing government as simply inventing it -- and doing so prodigiously. Richard Vedder at Washington University's <a href="http://csab.wustl.edu/">Center for the Study of American Business</a> estimates that government regulations now cost our nation a staggering $1.3 trillion each year.
 
<p>
<dd>	Most governors believe government should be less intrusive. Many are aggressively attacking unnecessary rules and regulations wherever they can. In California last year, Governor Pete Wilson abolished some 4,000 useless and outdated rules and regulations. In Kansas, Governor Bill Graves imposed a six-month moratorium on new government regulations, then eliminated 530 of the most burdensome and obsolete ones. In the past year, we in Michigan have rescinded more than 2,000 rules and regulations. 

<p>
<dd>	With Republicans in control of the 105th Congress and GOP governors at the helm in about two-thirds of the states, the Clinton administration will be thwarted in its attempts to promulgate new rules and regulations. GOP governors support the efforts of congressional Republicans to reform the federal regulatory system and impose cost-benefit analysis before the Federal Register grows any larger. <p><b>Welfare Reform </b>
<p>
<dd> 	The so-called Great Society turned out to be neither great nor good for society. By the 1990s, it was clear that the federal welfare system was discouraging work, financial independence, and the formation of families. Yet Bill Clinton twice vetoed welfare reform and held his nose last August when he signed the third bill Congress sent to his desk. Four years into his presidency, Clinton had done little to fulfill his 1992 campaign pledge "to end welfare as we know it" -- but he was happy to take credit for the success of the states while masking his party's hostility to transferring power out of Washington. <p>
<dd>	Shortly after Clinton signed the welfare-reform bill, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala told the <I>New Yorker</I> magazine, "Everyone agrees that [Clinton] signed [welfare reform] and he has to fix it, and to fix it we need to elect a Democratic president and Democratic Congress in 1996, so we can repeal the parts of the bill we hate." <p>
<dd>	There's more than a little irony to the fact that for three years, Clinton talked the talk of welfare reform while refusing to sign a bill. New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan aptly observed of Clinton's decision to sign this legislation 14 weeks before the election, "If it were 14 weeks after the election, he'd say no." <p>
<dd>	Once again, the governors deserve the credit for leading the welfare-reform movement. They understood that the welfare system could not be transformed unless it was linked to personal responsibility and accountability. Throughout the 1990s, many governors have applied for and received federal waivers to loosen Washington's grip on the welfare system. Waivers are cumbersome, bureaucratic procedures, but they have at least enabled the states to begin finding innovative solutions to the social and economic problems caused by dependency. The results have been dramatic. States with Republican governors for at least the last four years have already seen the number of people receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) decrease by an average of 16 percent since 1993. <p>
<dd>	No GOP governor has garnered more national attention for his welfare reforms than Wisconsin's Tommy Thompson. Building on the highly successful "Work Not Welfare" program, his administration in 1996 launched "Wisconsin Works," or "W-2." This program requires welfare recipients to participate in employment and job training to receive benefits. Since Wisconsin implemented these and other reforms, its welfare caseload has decreased by 33 percent. <p>
<dd>	Common-sense welfare reforms have also been implemented by, among others, New Hampshire's Steve Merrill, Connecticut's John Rowland, New York's George Pataki, Illinois's Jim Edgar, Iowa's Terry Branstad, Tennessee's Don Sundquist, Mississippi's Kirk Fordice, Texas's George W. Bush, Utah's Mike Leavitt, and Arizona's Fife Symington.<p>
<dd>	Our experience with welfare reform in the Great Lakes State has also been encouraging. Michigan requires welfare recipients to seek work, receive job training, or perform community service for at least 20 hours a week. Since we implemented our program "To Strengthen Michigan Families" in 1992: 

<P>

<ul>
<li> The AFDC caseload has dropped for 30 consecutive months; <li> The number of welfare recipients in Michigan has fallen to its lowest level in a quarter-century;<li> 101,652 families no longer receive cash benefits because they are working and earning paychecks; <li> Almost one in three Michigan welfare recipients on AFDC is working; nationally, only one in 11 is working. In our state, moreover, about half of all two-parent families on welfare are working. </ul>
<p>
<dd>	The success of Michigan and other states shows that the 104th Congress was right to try to get Washington out of the way of welfare reform. Some, like Virginia under Governor Allen, have passed time limits for benefits so that welfare cannot become a way of life. Others, like California, require beneficiaries to stay in school and earn educational credentials, a crucial step toward achieving independence. Still others, such as Massachusetts under Governor Weld, have ended the financial incentive to have additional children while on welfare by requiring teen mothers under the age of 18 to live at home. Whatever the particulars of reform, the 50 laboratories of democracy will continue to find innovative solutions to help the poor help themselves. Washington should just stay out of the way. <p><b>Education Reform </b>
<p>
<dd>
	As William Bennett and Lamar Alexander have frequently noted, education in America is the constitutional responsibility of our states, the social responsibility of our communities, and the moral responsibility of our families. Our nation does not need a $31-billion federal Department of Education. This agency contributes 7 percent of the funding of our nation's schools while mandating about 50 percent of the paperwork. And for all that meddling, not one bureaucrat in the Education Department teaches our students to be more competent in math, science, English, history, and government. It is time to return the money held hostage in Washington to the states and their citizens. After all, it's their money. <p>
<dd>	The national leaders in education reform have been the states, not Washington bureaucrats. More parental involvement, higher standards, greater discipline, increased autonomy for teachers, more choice for students and their families -- these are the keys to improving our public schools and making them the best in the world. <p>
<dd>	Governors have long understood that. They have led the burgeoning charter-school movement, which is injecting competition into the nation's public schools. Now there are hundreds of these innovative schools around the nation -- including 116 in California, 114 in Arizona, and 74 in Michigan. In my state alone, charter public schools are serving more than 10,400 students. And contrary to union propaganda, they are not elitist. In Michigan, for example, one in every three charter public schools was founded by African-American educators; more than 50 per cent of the enrollment in charter schools is African American or at-risk students. As a result, charter public schools serve more than twice the minority population that conventional public schools do. Michigan's first charter school, in the heart of Detroit, was so popular that its 300 slots drew more than 5,000 applications. One child was so eager to be admitted that he applied more than 100 times! <p>
<dd>	Even more sweeping plans have been enacted in Wisconsin and Ohio, giving students in the lowest performing and least disciplined schools the opportunity to choose better schools for their children. Bureaucrats and special interests can no longer keep our nation's children chained to a monopoly of mediocrity. The states will be in the vanguard of educational liberation, ensuring educational options for all families. <p>
<b>Free the States!</b>
<p>
<dd>
	Observers of all political persuasions agree: Liberalism is suffering a rout. America is choosing to go right and return to its conservative roots. In the 1990s, Republican governors have worked closely with legislatures to spearhead needed reform. Year after year, it is the governors who are slashing deficits and balancing the budget; who are cutting taxes and eliminating red tape; who are restoring personal responsibility to and reducing dependency on the welfare system; who are making public schools more accountable to parents and their communities.

</table><p>
<dd>	In 1996, Bill Clinton was able to parlay the governors' accomplishments into a successful re-election bid. But more enduring than any cleverly run campaign is the legacy of state-driven reform. For the foreseeable future, the domestic reforms that are most needed and most attuned to the conservative temper of the American people will continue to come from the nation's governors, working with their respective legislatures. They have a proven record of success. And they are more accountable to the people than any Beltway bureaucrat. Thus it is critical that Washington do the right thing for our nation. <p>
<dd>	Our message is: Free the states! Unshackle us from overweening federal control. Let us in the states govern as the U.S. Constitution meant us to govern. This is already beginning to happen, of course. During the past two years, the Republican-led 104th Congress ushered in a new spirit of cooperation with the governors and began the process of returning power to the states. All indications are that the Republican-led 105th Congress will try to devolve even more power, consistent with the Tenth Amendment. <p>
<dd>	But what of the Democrat in the White House? Although Bill Clinton is a former governor and has lately learned to speak like a conservative, deep down he probably has little sympathy for the states and their drive for reform. Therefore those of us beyond the Beltway dare not take devolution for granted. We know all about the false starts of the past. <p>
<dd>	In 1935, when the New Deal was taking root, Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis told a top aide to Roosevelt, "This is the end of this business of centralization, and I want you to go back and tell the president that we are not going to let this government centralize everything. It's come to an end. As for your young men, you call them together and tell them to get out of Washington -- tell them to go home, back to the states. That is where they must do their work." <p>
<dd>	Amen to that. 
<p>
<dd>	Let us hope that enough people in the Washington establishment see the wisdom of these words. Let us also hope that, during the presidential campaign four years from now, there will be candidates who do not merely speak like conservatives, but who truly believe in conservative ideas and know how to implement conservative policies consistent with the best in our nation's tradition. <p><dd>

a lot of foreigner bashing as a subtext in some of the
criticism."</b> -- NBC News reporter Gwen Ifill on PBS's <I>Washington

please....Gradually, even the most rabid partisans on the
committee seemed to understand they were confronted with a case
of serious numbskullery rather than clever skullduggery....But if
Clinton does survive this pounding, it may mean the revulsion
against the  -gate' phenomenon -- 20 years of ever-diminishing
scandals -- is now more intense than the disgust caused by any
individual charge. If so, it would be the President's most

<img src="/mrc/images/checkmark.gif"><b>"[Clinton] knows that he is consigning helpless people to
terrible hardship, and some to premature burials. He called the
press conference to announce that he will sign the bill
anyway....Mr. Shumyatsky is in the U.S. legally, but is not a
citizen. Thus his SSI checks will cease when the welfare bill
becomes law. He will have no money at all. Perhaps he will set up
light housekeeping in a park. Maybe he'll curl up on a grate.
Maybe he'll do the politicians a favor and just die."</b> -- Former
NBC News reporter Bob Herbert in his <I>New York Times</I> column on the
welfare reform bill, August 2. [88 points]<br><P>

<I>Runners-up</I><P>
<b>"Let me go to the minimum wage though for a minute...Ten million
people would be affected by it. Most of them live at or below the
poverty level. And this Congress which is trying to cut the
Earned Income Tax Credit, which conservatives used to tell us was
the alternative, and refuses to do anything about the minimum
wage makes Marie Antoinette look like Mother Teresa. It is just
an outrage!"</b> -- <I>Wall Street Journal</I> Executive Washington Editor
Al Hunt, March 30 edition of CNN's <I>Capital Gang</I>. [72]<BR><P>

<B>"For the fourth time this year Washingtonians were warned to boil
the drinking water because more than 10 percent of samples tested
positive for bacteria. The warning was lifted late Thursday but
not before thousands of people from all over the world, here to
see the fireworks in the nation's capital, were treated to water
that would embarrass a Third World country and Bob Novak. Maybe
this is enough to get your Republicans bent on cutting spending
for clean water to reconsider."</b> -- <I>Time</I> columnist Margaret

liberal bias made in a <I>Wall Street Journal</I> op-ed, quoted by
Howard Kurtz in the February 15 <I>Washington Post</I>. [67]

the constant, especially, far right-wing criticism that the news
on CBS is mainstream biased?"</b><P>
Dan Rather: <b>"...Well, my answer to that is basically a good Texas
phrase, which is bullfeathers....I think the fact that if someone
survives for four or five years at or near the top in network
television, you can just about bet they are pretty good at
keeping independence in their reporting. What happens is a lot of
people don't want independence. They want the news reported the
way they want it for their own special political agendas or
ideological reasons."</B> -- CNN's <I>Larry King Live</I>, March 11. [49]<br><p>

<img src="/mrc/images/checkmark.gif"><b>"I'm all news, all the time. Full power, tall tower. I want to
break in when news breaks out. That's my agenda. Now
respectfully, when you start talking about a liberal agenda and
all the, quote, liberal bias in the media, I quite frankly, and I
say this respectfully but candidly to you, I don't know what
you're talking about. Now if you want to talk about an issue,
what do I believe as a citizen of the United States of America, I
can tell you what I believe in. I believe in a strong defense,
clean water, and tight money."</b> -- Dan Rather to talk radio host

<center><h2>Quote of the Year</h2></center><P><P>

<img src="/mrc/images/checkmark.gif"><b>"In her Wednesday Commentary page column, Linda Bowles stated
that President Clinton and his former campaign adviser Dick
Morris both were `guilty of callous unfaithfulness to their wives
and children.' Neither man has admitted to being or been proven
to have been unfaithful. The Tribune regrets the error." </b> --
<I>Chicago Tribune</I> correction, September 5. [88 points]<br><P>

<I>Runners-up</I><P>
<b>"The Rapture, and I quote, `is the immediate departure from this
Earth of over four million people in less than a fifth of a
second,' unquote. This happily-volatilized mass of the saved were
born again in Jesus Christ. Everybody left behind will basically
go to Hell, but not before experiencing Armageddon, which is a
really bad end of the world. If you find yourself in this
situation, there isn't much you can do except one, starve
yourself, and two, get your head cut off. This loving Christmas
message coming as it did amid the jingle of the mall Santa and
the twinkling manger at the corner of Canal and the Ramparts made
it clear that the Rapture is indeed necessary. The evaporation of
four million people who believe this crap would leave the world
an instantly better place."</b> -- New Orleans-based National Public
Radio commentator Andrei Codrescu, December 19, 1995 <I>All Things
Considered</I>. [79]<br><P>

<b>"He [Jack Kemp] is a rare combination -- a nice conservative.
These days conservatives are supposed to be mean. They're
supposed to be haters."</b> -- CNN analyst Bill Schneider, August 9
<I>Inside Politics</I>. [71]<br><P>

<b>"He [Ted Kaczynski] wasn't a hypocrite. He lived as he wrote. His
manifesto, and there are a lot of things in it that I would agree
with and a lot of other people would, that industrialization and
pollution all are terrible things, but he carried it to an
extreme, and obviously murder is something that is far beyond any
political philosophy, but he had a bike. He didn't have any
plumbing, he didn't have any electricity."</b> -- <I>Time</I> Washington
reporter Elaine Shannon talking about the Unabomber, April 7

<title>Daily Commentary - January 14, 1997</title>

<body>

<center><h1>Daily Commentary<br>
January 14, 1997</h1></center>

<p><hr width=75% size=3><p>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

Have you ever noticed how America's elites always assume it's
inevitable that our young people are increasingly liberal in their
values?  Well there's a new survey out that shows the elites are
wrong once again.

<p>

The Higher Education Research Institute's survey of over 250,000
college freshmen shows that students are actually becoming --
listen to this -- more conservative.  For the fourth year in a
row, the number of students who support legalized abortion has
declined.  And there's no &quot;gender gap&quot; on the question.

<p>

The survey also showed that support for casual sex has reached
an all-time low. Over half of students now say that promiscuity should 
be avoided. They also say criminals should be punished, not coddled. 
Today's young people are also more self-confident and civic-minded, with
record numbers performing volunteer work and community service.  And 
up to 30 percent identify themselves as &quot;Born Again Christians.&quot;

<p>

These are exciting trends.  They show that conservatism is borne
out in practical experience.  It looks like increasingly young 
Americans are concluding that liberalism is a dead end.

<p>

For Family Research Council, this is Gary Bauer with today's
Washington Watch.  For more information about us, call 1-800-225-4008.
That number again:  1-800-225-4008.

<dd>When the American people gave Republicans the majority in both houses of Congress in 1994, many journalists and pundits called it a sea change, a transformation of the political landscape brought about by an upsurge of voter discontent.

<p>
<dd> In 1996, President Clinton was re-elected on a campaign platform that echoed much of the GOP agenda, and Republicans retained their majorities in both Houses for the first time since 1928. It is clear that American politics and government are being transformed not by sudden upheaval, but by the steady current of common-sense conservatism.
<p>

<dd> There is no longer any question that the nation wants smaller and more effective government, lower taxes, and a return to the values of freedom and responsibility. Exit polls from the election show that more voters identify themselves as conservative than liberal by a margin of almost two to one.

<p>

<dd> It is now up to elected officials on both halves of the political spectrum to fulfill the expectations so clearly expressed by American voters. Both presidential candidates campaigned on conservative principles, as did most winning candidates for House and Senate seats, Republican and Democrat alike.

<p>

<dd> One of the first priorities of the 105th Congress will be to work with the moderate Democrats who campaigned on conservative principles. Since the election, I have made more than 30 calls to the more moderate of the Democratic members of Congress to invite them to work with us on reforms at a pace the president can handle. We learned in the last Congress that Bill Clinton can't take change in big doses, and we'll continue to reduce wasteful Washington spending and unnecessary government programs, although at a somewhat slower pace.

<p>

<dd> The American people returned a Republican majority in both chambers in part because they know they can trust Republicans to hew to a conservative path and hold Bill Clinton to his campaign promises. One priority of the next Congress will be to help Bill Clinton keep the promises he has made to the American people.

<p>

<dd> Last year, Bill Clinton responded to the conservative call to balance the budget by promising voters a balanced budget with family tax relief. By law, he is supposed to submit a budget proposal to Congress in early February. We will thoroughly examine the president's budget to ensure that it lives up to the promises he made during the campaign. Now that the GOP has retained a majority in the House and increased its majority in the Senate, the president will find it difficult to back out of a real balanced budget agreement. And with the addition of two more GOP Senators, the American people are virtually assured passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment in the 105th Congress, perhaps even with the president's support.
   
<p>

<dd>The president has promised to get tough on crime and drugs, two of the biggest threats to America's families. The Republican Congress will make certain that crime stays on the top of the president's post-election agenda, and that during Bill Clinton's second term the nation will take the necessary steps to stem illegal drug use among our children.

<p>

<dd> Bill Clinton also promised to save Medicare from bankruptcy without imposing any untenable hardships upon Medicare recipients. As the polemics of this last election showed, Medicare can be used as a powerful political tool, but we will ensure that the long-term solvency of the program and the needs of Medicare recipients will supersede politics.

<p>

<dd> With its continued majorities in both houses, the Republican Congress will also be able to pursue those issues that speak to American families and their values, including -- with the stronger majority in the Senate -- an increased likelihood that we will be able to override the president's veto of the ban on partial-birth abortions. And, as promised by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a vote on a constitutional amendment to limit congressional terms will be the first substantive vote of the 105th Congress.

<p>

<dd>We will also move forward on Superfund reform so that the money now going to lawyers will go instead to speed the cleanup of toxic waste in neighborhoods across America. Building on last year's historic welfare reform, we will continue to replace dependency with opportunity through enterprise zones, public housing reforms, and opportunity scholarships. And now that we've seen union officials openly trying to buy Congress and foreign interests trying to buy the White House, we must address the role of money in politics before the next election.

<p>

<dd> The 105th Congress will also continue to maintain and develop effective congressional oversight and review of the executive branch. One of Congress's key constitutional responsibilities is to assess whether government programs work and how they might be improved.

<p>

<dd> The move toward conservative government has been a steady tide, and the 1996 elections exposed the erosion of support for decades of liberal policies. For the first time in many years, we will see not a battle between liberal ideas and conservative principles, but rather a debate over how to apply conservative principles to repair the damage caused by decades of Big Government liberalism.

<p>

<dd> Elected officials no longer argue over whether to balance the budget, but how and when; not over whether to shrink the size of the government, but by how much and to what aim; not over whether to eliminate harmful welfare programs, but over how best to end the cycle of dependency and reward work and personal responsibility.

<p>

<dd> Conservatives should be pleased that common-sense conservatism has occupied the center of political debate. There is no longer any argument over whether the American people want to move our country in a more conservative direction; only a debate over how quickly we can get there.

<dd>The lesson of the election is this: there will be no end to the era of Big Government until there is a Republican president, and there will be no Republican president until conservatives can say what America will look like in the post-Big Government era. The voters knew what they were doing. They elected a Democratic president who said the era of Big Government is over and, for insurance, a Republican Congress that actually believes it. They refused to put conservatives completely in charge because President Clinton persuaded enough voters that a Republican government would make tomorrow worse than today for everyone, except perhaps for men making more than $75,000 a year. So in the time of great change, the voters made sure not much will change.

<p>

<dd>The worst mistake conservatives could make would be to back away from a bold agenda. The country is moving our way. If we want to be a governing party instead of a congressional party, we must learn to paint a conservative picture of the future in a more compelling way than liberals paint theirs. All our recent presidential losses  --  1976, 1992, and 1996  --  have come because of our failure to do just that.

<p>

<dd>Our success has, in part, been our undoing. In 1964, Ronald Reagan defined our twin enemies: an evil empire abroad and an arrogant empire at home. Now we have won. The Cold War is over and the end of the era of Big Government has been proclaimed. In defeating our enemies, we have become good at saying what we are against, but not at saying what we are for. 
        
<p>

<dd>Our task is harder than that of liberals. Their message of hope is a feint to the right plus a trivial federal program. Our message of hope is a real step to the right plus a dose of inconvenience: expect less from government and more of ourselves. Our message is a lot of trouble. It would be nice to be able to hire someone else  --  say, the government  --  to save our children from drugs, make our streets safer, strengthen our families, and restore our values. But only we can. Our advantage is that our message of hope actually works.

<p>

<dd>We conservatives have our work cut out for us. We must learn to say what we are for in plain words. We need choir practice. We sing the right song, but we are embarrassingly out of tune when we get to the part about the future. Sometimes the voters must listen to us and think we don't have a clue. We need to stop sounding like a convention of Washington lawyers who have not yet heard, for example, that family life is harder because schools close at 3 p.m. and parents work until 5:30.        
        <p><dd>

Bob Dole was at his best when he explained that his tax cut would pay for four months of day care at Casey's General Store Child Development Center, in Ankeny, Iowa. The working mother at Casey's didn't need to believe in the tax cut to vote for Senator Dole. She did need to believe that he understood her struggles with day care. Eliminating the U.S. Department of Education and encouraging home schooling alone do not answer the education question for about 90 percent of American families. We must paint a vivid picture of how we will help create the best schools in the world.
        <p><dd>

In Congress, the greatest opportunities for conservatives are: (1) Enact the Balanced Budget Amendment; (2) make welfare reform work; (3) cut the capital gains tax in half; (4) eliminate chunks of overbearing laws and regulations and start over; (5) create a citizens' Congress with term limits. With a Democratic president, I hold no hope for two of the most important initiatives: a new tax system (I favor two low rates and just a few deductions) and a GI Bill for Kids that would convert federal money now spent on programs into scholarships that middle- and low-income students could use at any school.
        <p><dd>

The most ominous liberal initiatives? (1) Supreme Court Justice appointments; (2) a tilt toward labor; (3) more federal control of local schools.
<p><dd>

        I worry far less about what Bill Clinton will do than about what we will fail to do. We could become comfortable as a congressional party, a perpetual Republican insurance policy against the excesses of a moderate Democratic president. Some conservatives are even suggesting that the presidency has become miniaturized, barely worth having. This is very dangerous thinking.
        <p><dd>
The president's job is to recognize our urgent needs, develop strategies to deal with them, and to persuade at least half of us that he is right. The president should be the nation's agenda setter. Conservatives should see as indispensable a strong Republican president who can tell us where we are going and how we will get there. Without such a president, this country will never see a new tax system, parental choice among the best schools, a strengthening of national defense and of families, a balanced budget, or an end to the era of Big Government. 
        <p><dd>

What I fear most about Bill Clinton's second term as president is that conservatives will fail to do what is necessary to persuade at least half the people that tomorrow will be better than today only if we expect less of government and more of ourselves.

        The election of 1996 confirmed that the Reagan Republican coalition is the natural governing majority in the United States. In January, Republicans will hold a majority in the House of Representatives, an increased majority in the Senate, the governorships of 32 states that represent 75 percent of American voters, 51 percent of state legislative seats outside the South, and unified control of the governorship and state legislature in 12 states (compared with complete Democratic control in six).
<p><dd>
        Bill Clinton's re-election with a 49 percent plurality does not mitigate the depth of conservative strength any more than Eisenhower's twin victories or Nixon's 1972 landslide hindered the growth of government and the consolidation of the welfare state.

If the AFL-CIO spent a mere 10 percent of its members' dues on political activities this year, then it spent $600 million in "soft money," "volunteer" staff time, and phone and photocopy costs to supplement the well-publicized commitment of $35 million in television, radio, and mail attacks upon Republican representatives. Yet even this tsunami of money from unions, environmental groups, and even foreign interests could not erode the firmly entrenched gains of the Republican Party at all levels of government.
        <p><dd>
The failure of the Dole candidacy does not indicate that the tax issue has lost its potency. The 105th Congress will have 200 House members and 44 Senators who have signed and campaigned on the Taxpayer Protection Pledge against raising income taxes. And more than 700 state legislators have signed the state Taxpayer Protection Pledge forswearing <I>any</I> tax hike. Initiatives placed before voters on November 5 also spoke loudly to the tax issue: Florida voted to require a two-thirds supermajority of the people to enact any new constitutionally imposed tax  --  in effect, any state income tax. Nevada voted to require a two-thirds vote of the state legislature to enact any tax increase. South Dakota voted to require either a majority vote of the people or a two-thirds vote of the legislature for any tax increase. California voted to require a vote of the people for any local tax increase. Florida voters rejected a penny a pound tax on sugar to "save" the Everglades. Nebraska voters defeated an initiative sponsored by the teachers union to make "quality education" a "fundamental constitutional right." Oregon voted down an effort to expand a light-rail system.
        <p><dd>
Conservatives have several opportunities in the 105th Congress. First, corporate welfare spending should be eliminated. The abolition of corporate welfare spending saves taxpayers money, eliminates a source of corruption, and reduces the role of government in the economy.
        <p><dd>
The labor unions' misuse of compulsory union dues to play politics gives Republicans an opportunity to recreate the Kefauver Commission that examined corruption in labor unions in the 1950s. The <I>Beck</I> decision by the Supreme Court in 1988 specifically forbids the use of compulsory union dues for purposes beyond the negotiation and maintenance of a member's contract. Yet the Clinton administration refuses to enforce this right of workers and the labor union bosses have unconstitutionally spent money that does not belong to them. Congress must shine some sunlight on the inner workings of this corruption.
        <p><dd>
And Congress should continue three crusades. First, school choice: Clinton will veto a plan to give America's poorest families control over their education. But let's make this father of a child in private school publicly and repeatedly expose his own hypocrisy. Second, tort reform: Clinton's party is owned by the trial lawyers. Make him sing for his supper and publicly admit that he is bought and paid for by vetoing reform measure after reform measure. And third, the Republican leadership in the House has promised a vote every April 15 on a constitutional amendment to require a supermajority of two-thirds to raise any tax. Congress should continue this anniversary tradition.
        <p><dd>
The experience of the 104th Congress teaches us to continue to push for a balanced budget by 2002 with tax cuts. Placed in this box, Clinton cannot expand government and must reduce both discretionary spending and entitlement costs. In just two years, with this strategy, Republicans ended two seemingly immortal programs: the welfare entitlement and farm subsidies. And Republicans should continue to be both persistent and patient. The welfare state was not built in two years. It will not fall to the forces of freedom in two, four, or even six years.
        <p><dd>
The greatest dangers of a Clinton second term are his judicial appointments, his vacillation in world affairs, and his willingness to abuse and corrupt the FBI and the IRS to attack and harass his political enemies. Republicans will have to work hard and learn fast to ensure that our foreign policy does not implode and to keep Clinton's bureaucracy from continuing to misuse its power.

        For the first time in 60 years, a majority friendly to small business has taken root in Congress. As measured by National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), the 103rd Congress voted with small business about 55 percent of the time. That number shot up to 70 percent in the 104th Congress. We expect it to be even higher in the 105th Congress.
        <p><dd>

The 104th Congress was gratifying for those of us who spent the last 40 years fighting the legislation of anti-business majorities. At the end of the 104th Congress, NFIB recognized a record number of "Guardians of Small Business": members of Congress who voted with small business at least 70 percent of the time. But the 104th Congress was by no means perfect. It was necessarily partisan, and its reform-by-leaps agenda provoked opposition from the press and the White House. We at NFIB hope to see a more incremental approach to reform in the 105th Congress and a bipartisan approach to passing conservative legislation. 
        <p><dd>

The new Congress will have the opportunity to address fundamental issues such as tax reform, increased affordability and availability of health care, reform of the civil-justice system, elimination of the death (estate) tax for the family farm, ranch, and business, relief of crushing and unnecessary business regulations, and balancing the federal budget. The incremental steps on tax reform and health-care reform made at the end of the 104th Congress laid the groundwork for more changes in the 105th.
        <p><dd>

I am optimistic about this second term, based on President Clinton's statements during the campaign, in which he often mentioned small business, and his appointment of Erskine Bowles, former head of the Small Business Administration, as White House chief of staff. 
        <p><dd>

However, we are urging small-business owners to be alert to small steps by the administration that, taken together, could result in health-care "reforms" that kill businesses by a thousand cuts. We hope President Clinton will not seek to enhance his legacy by increasing mandated health benefits, loading the costs of those mandates on the backs of hardworking small-business owners and their families. This is not the way to make health care more available or affordable, and it would destroy jobs and endanger the health of our economy.
        <p><dd>

The president has indicated he wants to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act. This, too, would be an unnecessary mandate on small business. It will be a sad day in America when we need the government to facilitate parent-teacher meetings or doctors' visits. In small business, employees are often the family members of the owner, and those who are not family members are nevertheless treated as such. Small-business owners and their employees get along very nicely without help from Washington.
        <p><dd>

Congress should fight such mandates by simply drawing a line in the sand. Tell the president, with all due respect, that he cannot dictate the way Americans run their lives, and that he cannot pay for government solutions with payroll taxes. Conservatives need to build a bipartisan coalition that will turn back every attempt to expand the role of government and prevent the cumulative effect of a thousand deadly cuts.

        In 1994, the American electorate put liberalism to the sword and severely wounded the Democratic Party. The results were a clear mandate for change, but euphoric Republicans mistook it as a mandate for revolution. Now the 1996 election results are in, President Clinton has been re-elected, and the opportunity for swift and total change is over.

<dd>
        This is not to say that the country is any less conservative in 1996 than in 1994 or that the Republican Party is no longer in ascendance. In fact, the policies that President Clinton ostensibly embraced during his re-election campaign are clear evidence that conservatism is still setting the political and economic agenda in America and will do so for the foreseeable future.
        <p><dd>
The electorate's conservatism, however, is instinctive, not logically consistent or intellectually rigorous. The election of 1996 should remind conservatives that American voters generally care less about ideological labels and the impassioned pursuit of principle than about "getting the job done." The American people want their children to learn in school, they want to feel secure in their homes, they want to know they will be cared for in their old age, and they want a culture and economy that is family-friendly. Policy people and politicians covered in the dust and sweat of the arena may rejoice at calling this "conservatism." Average Americans call it looking out for their loved ones and their pocketbooks. 
        <p><dd>
On Election Day, the American people chose a president who worked hard to show he was looking out for their loved ones and their pocketbooks, too. Although conservatives may have had better ideas, Bill Clinton had compassion. He came across as the family physician, while conservatives were portrayed as eager surgeons. 
        <p><dd>
In the end, we failed to explain why our policies for devolution and privatization and less government were more compassionate. Ultimately, that is the reason why the electorate settled for the therapeutic model of Clinton's "Little Things Presidency," based on concerns like school uniforms, teenage smoking, illiteracy, and church burnings.
        <p><dd>
Voters may have reined in the Republican Party in 1996, but they objected less to the substance than to presentation and pace. The message from the American people is this: "Go ahead, but go slow. Offer us a competing vision that is convincingly compassionate, not cavalier. If you are saying less government is compassionate, tell us why. And, be careful on Medicare, on devolution of power to the states, on deregulation of the American economy, and a host of other issues. We only put Bill Clinton there to act as an emergency brake on any rash moves by a Republican Congress."
        <p><dd>
Humility, rhetorical moderation, and patience are the principal lessons that conservatives in the 105th Congress should learn from the failures and successes of the 104th. There is no presidential campaign on the horizon, so the 105th Congress should focus on policy, not personalities. It should aim to improve the lives of the average American by applying conservative principles to government policy, not by pillorying Bill Clinton. If the president wants to join in -- or even lead -- a conservative initiative, then conservatives should welcome him to the team. And whenever he reverts to his liberal instincts, conservatives should oppose him fiercely but without the bombast, arrogance, and hard-edged ideological rhetoric that so colored public perceptions of GOP legislative controversies during the first Clinton administration.
        <p><dd>
In terms of legislative opportunities, conservatives must defend welfare reform from the attacks that will inevitably follow Bill Clinton's reelection. Tax cuts and continued deregulation of the economy must remain priorities. The devolution of power to the states on everything from education to Medicaid must go forward. Term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment are certain winners with the public and good policy to boot. And ensuring the financial stability of Medicare without alienating older voters or increasing taxes remains the Gordian knot of national politics. 
        <p><dd>
With or without a Republican Congress, the presidency is still the most powerful office in the world. There are other, more discreet ways for the president to advance a liberal agenda. The "gays in the military" policy was decreed by executive order, as were most of his foreign policy and national security initiatives. And, the president still retains the awesome power of appointing judges to the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts. A Clintonesque judiciary could undo conservative accomplishments in the Congress, in state legislatures, and through ballot initiatives. 
        <p><dd>
The 1996 elections were a lesson in compassion, not a repudiation of conservatism. We will achieve the dream of a generation of conservative governance once we offer our vision of effective compassion.

<dd>    Now, the people who brought us the Bush campaign of 1992 and the Dole campaign of 1996 are receding, temporarily, into the shadows. They have escaped, as Churchill would have said, "unsung and unhung." It is critically important that we conservatives understand why the Republicans lost in 1992 and 1996.

<dd>The morning after the election, a friend of mine told the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>: "The evolution of the Republican Party into a confident, conservative, aggressive, pro-family Southern and Western party is complete." I respect my friend's superb political skills, but this way of looking at the Republican future will only bring the party permanent minority status. Looking at the electoral maps of 1992 and 1996, we see that a party limited to the South and West will never regain the White House. Barry Goldwater joked about sawing off the Northeast, but Ronald Reagan carried New York and Massachusetts <I>twice</I>. I'll go with Reagan.

<p><dd>
        Our analysis of the 1996 results brings forth this startling conclusion: The GOP was defeated in the past two presidential elections because the Catholic vote collapsed. Exit polls will not tell us this. What we learn from them  --  and it is important  --  is who came to the polls and what they did. But the Family Research Council's examination of selected counties with high Catholic populations show that the GOP turned off huge numbers of Catholic voters who had been powerfully trending toward the conservative social positions of Ronald Reagan and George Bush in the 1980s. These counties may be the keys to the electoral lock.
        <p><dd>
It is not that Bill Clinton was so popular in these counties. (In many of them, Clinton's 1996 vote tally is little better than that of Michael Dukakis in 1988.) It is that the "bread alone" Republican campaigns of 1992 and 1996 were so unpopular. The GOP turned off voters by talking about money, only money, and avoiding family and social issues. The party must find a way to regain the support of "soccer moms," to be sure. But it can't afford to alienate the "bocce uncles" in ethnic Catholic communities either.
        <p><dd>
Partial-birth abortion is a horrific procedure. It shocks the conscience just to think of it. Even such liberals as Mary McGrory, Pat Moynihan, and Richard Cohen recoil from it. But Bill Clinton approves of it. His veto of the ban on partial-birth abortions was the cruelest act of any American president. Yet he paid no political price because the Dole-Kemp campaign refused to confront him about it. Joe Barrett, a perceptive analyst of the Catholic vote, says: "Bill Clinton knew the Republicans were afraid to confront him on partial-birth abortion. He knew he could get away with it." And he did. Dole might have turned to Clinton in the first debate and said: "You vetoed a bill to save unborn children at the very threshold of life. You approve of a procedure where the abortionist forces sharp scissors into the back of the child's skull and then inserts a catheter to suck out her brains. You say this is necessary because the child might have a handicap. Well, Mr. President, I know more about handicaps than you do. If I'm elected president, I'll sign that bill with my <I>left</I> hand."

<p><dd>
        On quotas and set-asides, Dole was not silent, only late and woefully incoherent. This is a powerful issue of justice. He could have made it a centerpiece of his national campaign. Instead, his message was garbled, confused, muted. Thus, while Dole got trounced in the Golden State, the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI) carried the state handily. Clinton was allowed to say he opposed quotas. When? The party that nominated him has imposed rigid quotas on its own delegations since 1972. His own Cabinet was an exercise in quota-mongering, employing the now famous formula: EGG  --  ethnicity, gender, geography.
        <p><dd>
The impact of these two vital issues on voters in crucial counties with large Catholic populations can only be imagined. Any inclination to write off the Northeast and Midwest, therefore, in the vain pursuit of a Southern and Western strategy must be resisted. 
        <p><dd>
Of course the Republican party must continue to be the party that Reagan built. Of course it must continue to strengthen its growing dominance in the South and West. It must stand for a strong defense, smaller government, and lower taxes. But it must stand for more than that. The sanctity of human life, the defense of marriage, the rebuilding of a vibrant and decent culture, these things matter most. If the Republicans cannot speak to these matters of the heart, they will never become the majority party. Indeed, the party may not survive at all.

The American electorate is still clearly trending to the right of center, and the 105th Congress will be the most conservative legislative body in the modern American political era. The newly elected Republican senators are decidedly more conservative than the Democrats (and Republicans) they replaced. 
        <p><dd>

The ideological makeup of the next Congress is no accident. The American people are telling Washington they still want a social safety net, but with greater emphasis on personal responsibility. They want a government that is smaller and more efficient. They are not comfortable with one-party control of the White House, Senate, and House because the GOP offered no vision and optimism in this election. But they overwhelmingly prefer a conservative direction to a liberal one. Just look at President Clinton's tack to the right in favor of a balanced budget, welfare reform that ends the federal entitlement to government assistance and shifts money and power back to the states, a tougher approach to crime, and even limited tax cuts. 
        

<p><dd>
Conservatives face a great opportunity now that Bill Clinton is worried about establishing his place in history and is willing to distance himself from congressional Democrats. We should, therefore, press for passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment (with a supermajority provision for boosting taxes), tax cuts, and entitlement reforms. 
        <p><dd>

True tax reform isn't likely with Bill Clinton in the White House. But the GOP must keep articulating a pro-growth vision for the future whose centerpiece is turning the initials "IRS" into "RIP"  --   Rest in Peace. In the interim, while we press for a capital-gains tax cut and a major increase in exemptions for children, we must keep our eye on the real goal: fundamentally overhauling the federal tax code and replacing it with a simple, fair, low flat tax. 

<p><dd>

        On Medicare, the GOP made an enormous mistake in the 104th Congress by constantly talking about increased deductibles, higher copayments, managed care, and "slowing the rate of growth." The key to communicating a positive message on Medicare reform is medical savings accounts. MSAs can give seniors more choices, more control, and more money in their pockets, without having to enter a dreaded HMO. We use a variation of MSAs at <I>Forbes</I> magazine. Even the United Mine Workers use MSAs. They work. It's time to make the case for MSAs before the American people. 
        

<p><dd>

It is also time to find our voice on Social Security reform. We must preserve the current system for those entering the system in the next 12 to 15 years. But we should start a new Social Security system for younger people, in which part of their payroll taxes would flow to their own Individual Retirement Account. Under this plan, they, not Washington politicians, would own the assets and invest them in the real American economy.
<p><dd>
Perhaps the most important lesson from the last Congress is that we must first explain to the American people the magnitude of the problems we want to solve before we try to legislate solutions. Next we must build support for our solutions by creating grassroots coalitions and getting our message directly to the public through paid advertising. 
<p><dd>
My biggest concern about the 105th Congress is that conservatives may lose their nerve. The status quo is our enemy. We should strive for steady progress over the next two years while we prepare public opinion for substantial reform of taxes and entitlements. We need to get back on offense, set the national agenda, and avoid getting sidetracked by liberals. For example, we shouldn't balk at trying to ban partial birth abortions. 
<p><dd>
        Congress will be tempted to place more limits on campaign giving. We tried that approach after Watergate and got the mess we have today. Instead, Congress should remove or substantially raise limits on individual giving as long as there is full and prompt disclosure. We should require independent campaign committees to make weekly disclosures of their spending and the sources of their money. Trust the voters to decide whether the candidate is selling his soul to some special interest. Do the same thing on campaign spending caps, which independent groups have already blown to smithereens. Stop the hypocrisy. 
        <p><dd>
The bottom line: Conservatives have a golden opportunity to force President Clinton to deliver on his conservative-sounding rhetoric. Carpe Diem.

        The conservative agenda of the 104th Congress was validated not only by the results of the 1996 election, but by the fact that President Clinton ran on much of the same platform. President Clinton knows a winning agenda when he sees it. What happens now? We carry it out. But this time, we must act as a long-term majority party. We must not act as though we have two years to win or lose. We will have to march to a more methodical pace.

<dd>As members of the first Republican Congress in 40 years, we changed the way Washington did business. Now both political parties agree that we must balance the budget by cutting spending, not by raising taxes. We all agree that the best decisions are made closest to the people, not by a remote government. We have all learned that the people want the government to perform its core functions better, and to stop wasting their money on programs that are no longer effective or necessary. Now most parts of the political spectrum supports a national effort to achieve strong families and revive "civil society" through personal responsibility and freedom.
        <p><dd>
This war of ideas is over. The people have chosen these ideas over bigger government. Now we must move patiently forward in implementing them.
        

<p><dd>

I see a number of opportunities for the 105th Congress. We must continue our push for a smaller, more focused, more efficient federal government concerned with core principles and functions. We should pass the Balanced Budget Amendment. We must also eliminate corporate welfare  --  those direct spending subsidies that only benefit very narrow groups. We should start by eliminating the two cabinet-level agencies that contain the most corporate welfare of all: the departments of Energy and Commerce. Obviously we must maintain the vital core programs of those agencies, including Nuclear Weapons Development, the National Weather Service, the Patent and Trademark Office, and the Census Bureau. But many others can be eliminated, privatized, or devolved to state and local levels of government. I support a proposal that would save $23 billion over five years by eliminating the Department of Energy and $6 billion for eliminating the Department of Commerce. These savings should be used to reduce the deficit and cut taxes.
<p><dd>

        Fundamental reform of the tax code and the IRS is also long overdue. Our tax code of 500 million words doesn't make sense to even the sharpest tax attorney. The code punishes families, entrepreneurs, and growth. There is also growing support in Congress to require every bill to cite precisely the constitutional authority for the statutory changes it proposes.
        

<p><dd>
My greatest fear for the 105th Congress is that the people elected on the conservative agenda will lose confidence in our own ideas even though they clearly reflect the direction the American people want to go. We should not retreat in the face of victory. We cannot afford, for the sake of our children, to continue spending as we have. We can preserve such programs as Medicare and student loans while still reducing government and adhering to core governing principles.
        

<p><dd>

I could not be more optimistic about the future of this nation. We are on the right track. We must press forward with confidence, compassion, wisdom, inclusiveness, and a smile. We must each look within ourselves for solutions to our terrible social problems of crime, loss of family, drugs, and welfare dependency. When we change individually, we will change the nation. I think people are beginning to realize that this, not more government, is the answer. This, above all else, is why the conservative movement is alive and well.

        We are in a dealignment, not a realignment. Old parties are weakening, many voters split tickets in pursuit of divided government, and new party loyalties are slow to form. The challenge for conservatives, then, is to articulate a simple, cogent message based on first principles and their applications to specific policies.

<dd>Please indulge a California example. The elections in our state were, in many instances, disappointing, with the Republicans losing their majority in the state assembly. But the silver lining was the passage of the California Civil Rights Initiative. CCRI will abolish race and gender preference programs sponsored by the state and local governments. The proponents' campaign was largely based on a single principle: It is wrong for a government to discriminate based on race. The underfunded campaign was led by a man of unwavering principle and an ability to articulate his principles in both speeches and soundbites. CCRI prevailed even in the face of a well-organized campaign of distortion abetted by the free media.
        <p><dd>
CCRI wasn't enough to deliver California to Dole. In fact, Dole's last-minute embrace of the bipartisan initiative probably drove away potential supporters, because his campaign egregiously mishandled the issue. If Dole had sparked a national conversation on the meaning of rights and citizenship in a free society, beginning at the Republican convention and continuing through the election, he would have done a great service to his party and his country.
        
<p><dd>

If conservatives are going to relimit government, or even halt the progress of Clinton's myriad of small welfare-state initiatives, they must convince the public that a government in a free society simply may not do certain things, even though some people would benefit from them. Affirmative action has benefited many people, proponents of racial preferences contend. The best response to this claim is not to deny it, but to ask, "So what?" It is wrong for the government to discriminate, therefore it should be proscribed from doing so.
        <p><dd>

This critique applies to many popular welfare-state initiatives, such as the recent debacle over raising the minimum wage, the violation by government of private-property rights, and intrusive education policies; conservatives must use it. Without a principled position, opponents of welfare-state programs easily yield to "yes, but": "<I>Yes</I>, I realize that all 212 federal job-training programs have been complete failures up to this point, <I>but</I> through careful study and the application of the latest social-science techniques, this latest one will succeed. Surely you don't deny there's a problem?"
<p><dd>

        The biggest danger facing Republicans in the 105th Congress is that they will be unable to fend off Clinton's endless string of targeted welfare-state programs, from expanded family leave, scholarships for community college students, mandates on health-care companies, health care for children, and so on. Aiding Clinton's cause is a sympathetic media establishment and a citizenry eager to receive its slice of the government pie. Our best hope of relimiting government is, as Amherst College professor Hadley Arkes is fond of saying, to start using principles we didn't even know we had.

        At the presidential level, Republicans proved in 1996 that you can't beat the Michael Jordan of political candidates with a tired Washington insider whose communication skills predated television, or even radio. At the congressional level, Republicans demonstrated they still have a chance to become a true majority party if they can convince Americans they are problem solvers and not merely stingy accountants obsessed with shrinking the federal fisc. We live in a post-partisan environment where it is difficult for a party to retain brand-name loyalty. Exit polls and the outcomes of various popular initiatives show the electorate often supports Republican solutions so long as they aren't identified with the GOP (as when Californians rejected higher tax rates on the rich while backing color-blind government).

<dd>Republicans need to show they really are for smaller government by abolishing the scandal-ridden Department of Commerce. Not only is the agency a slush fund for corporate welfare, but it also exemplifies the heart of campaign-finance scandals, which is the power of Washington to direct economic outcomes. Conservatives must also push to expand the concept of medical savings accounts that got a foot in the health-care door last year. The failures of the 104th Congress were writ in stone the day the Republicans decided not to take control of the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Tax Committee and adjust the ways they calculate budgetary and tax issues. They will continue to limit their liability to govern to the extent they leave the Congressional number-crunchers alone.
        <p><dd>
I worry that Republicans will try to bridge the gender gap by throwing many of their long-held principles into it. It's one thing to rethink how best to communicate why a smarter, smaller government can improve women's lives. It's quite another to buy Bill Clinton's salami-slice increases in state power because they fear the wrath of soccer moms and waitress moms. A majority of white women and married women voted Republican for Congress. There is no reason for panic on gender.
        <p><dd>
Unions  --  especially the teacher-monopolies that control public education  --  must be confronted. The last election proved they can't be placated. Congressional hearings and commissions must subpoena their records and expose how they spend their money. If just some of their members begin to publicly question where their dues are going, the unions' effectiveness in the 1998 elections and beyond can be curbed.
<p><dd>
        Finally, the GOP Congress must work even more closely with the 32 Republican governors to fashion legislation. Whether they cooperate and present a unified message to voters in the 1998 elections will dictate in large part if Republicans can cement and extend their grassroots gains.

Two years ago, the Democratic Party was imploding. Democrats were losing elections almost everywhere. They even lost mayoral elections in Los Angeles, New York City, and Jersey City  --  places where there virtually are no Republicans. They had no platform and no agenda. They still have no platform and no agenda. Yet in 1996 they retained the White House, ran credible races for the U.S. House and Senate and gained 96 seats in state legislatures. How did this happen? 
<p><dd>
        There are three lessons for the GOP: (1) Message trumps no message; (2) at the margin, the female vote can be won with rhetoric and small policy changes; and (3) a new kind of strategic liberalism has emerged from the Democrats' desperate attempt to regain power. 
<p><dd><b>Message.</b> When Americans entered the voting booths last November 5, everyone remembered the Democratic message: Republicans want to cut spending for Medicare, Medicaid, and education in order to lower taxes on the rich. Very few people could remember Bob Dole's message. Why? A simple idea repeated over and over again is easily remembered, whereas complex ideas, each explained in many different ways, are not. 
<p><dd><b>Gender Gap. </b>
In the congressional elections, men favored Republicans by 9 percentage points; women favored Democrats by 10 points. Among suburbanites, men favored Republicans by 12 points; women favored Democrats by 6. Thus the gender gap can hurt either party. But Republicans must nevertheless be concerned. In 1996, many women who ordinarily might be expected to vote Republican (and whose husbands vote Republican) voted for a Democrat instead  --  perhaps supplying the margin of victory in many races. This tendency has deepened over time. Between 1992 and 1994, the preference for congressional Democrats grew from 6 to 10 percentage points among all women and switched from 6 points for Republicans to 6 points for Democrats among suburban women. 
<p><dd>

        What explains the gender gap? Apart from differences between the two parties over abortion, Democratic candidates repeatedly used the words "children" and "education" at their convention and in their campaigns, and addressed other issues of special concern to women. By all rights, candidates who are beholden to teachers unions should not be viewed as friends of children. Yet Bill Clinton successfully campaigned as the pro-education candidate. By contrast, Bob Dole's plan to abolish the U.S. Department of Education made him seem hostile to education. 
<p><dd>

        Clinton promised more money for breast cancer research and Internet access in all schools. He signed legislation to allow women to stay in the hospital for two days after childbirth. (In focus groups, women indicated that the two-day mandate was one of the most important reasons why they preferred Clinton.) President Clinton and Democratic congressional candidates also highlighted issues over which the federal government has virtually no control, such as school uniforms and report cards for schools. 
<p><dd>

        <b>Strategic Liberalism.</b> President Clinton may have declared that "the era of Big Government is over," but focus groups reveal that people do not equate health-insurance mandates with "Big Government." In this and in other areas, liberals have discovered that they can expand the power of government incrementally without appearing to be liberal, and can often woo women voters at the same time. 
<p><dd>

        During the campaign, the president demonstrated his capacity to advance ideas inconsistent with his own past positions and inimical to key constituencies in order to gain electoral advantage. The mandate for two-day hospital stays is a perfect example. It is completely inconsistent with the HillaryCare plan of 1993, which sought to encourage everyone to join health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and to allow health-care specialists to make such decisions based on medical needs and cost effectiveness. The mandate also goes against the president's managed competition constituency.
<p><dd>
        This is a new kind of liberalism. The old liberalism was special-interest liberalism. One could predict the agenda of old liberalism based on the demands of its special-interest constituents. Strategic liberalism is much harder to predict. Counterstrategies are much harder to devise. Moreover, since strategic liberalism involves a new way of thinking, initiatives could come from younger members of Congress rather than the leadership. Expect strategic liberals to begin the 105th Congress with mandates of special interest to women: annual mammograms with no deductible; no deductible for mastectomies; annual pap smears with no deductible; checkups for children with no deductible.
<p><dd>

        The onslaught will continue, as special interests descend on the Capitol: chiropractors, naturopaths, acupuncturists, <I>in vitro</I> fertilization centers, et cetera. At the same time, the administration will push for KidCare -- Hillary Clinton's health-care plan adapted for children. 
<p><dd><b>Conservative Response.</b> The conservative response to traditional liberalism has been a completely defensive strategy: resist and retreat, resist and retreat. This would be a disastrous response to strategic liberalism. Conservatives would die a death of a thousand cuts. After two years, marginal voters would come to believe that only liberal Democrats care about health care for women and children. 
<p><dd>

        The conservative counterstrategy must couple the traditional commitment to such "conservative" issues as lower taxes, deregulation, and privatization with a focus on such "liberal" concerns as health, education, environment, pensions, and other issues of interest to women. In each area, conservatives must offer an aggressive, free-enterprise agenda for solving problems.

        In 1994, conservatives were in a biblical frame of mind. After 40 years in the wilderness, House Republicans were finally crossing into the promised land of majority status. The 1996 election should prompt another look at the Bible, particularly the 41st chapter of Genesis. After Pharaoh discloses his dream about healthy cows and ears of grain consuming sickly ones, Joseph interprets its meaning: Egypt will enjoy abundance, but a famine will follow. During the fat years, Joseph tells him, make preparations to survive the lean years.

<p>

<dd>For conservatives, a period of plenty probably lies in the near future. They should not assume that the abundance will last forever; instead they should prepare for serious challenges a few years beyond.
<p><dd>
        Things look fine right now. Perhaps even more significant than the GOP retention of Congress is the party's strength in statehouses. Republicans continue to hold 32 governorships, their highest level in a quarter century. Despite some recent losses in state legislatures, the GOP has held most of its 1994 gains. In Florida, Republicans now control both chambers in a Southern state for the first time since Reconstruction.
        <p><dd>
So just when power is starting to flow from Washington to the states, Republicans are waiting at the receiving end. Furthermore, GOP strength at the state level translates into a much deeper reserve of congressional candidates.
        <p><dd>
The GOP will probably do even better in 1998. In 33 of the past 34 midterm elections, the party holding the presidency has lost ground in the House. The historical pattern has been less consistent in the Senate, but Republican prospects look especially bright this time. They hold half of the 34 seats up in 1998, and only a couple of GOP incumbents face trouble. Meanwhile, Republicans could even beat several Democrats, especially extreme liberals such as Barbara Boxer of California. Early signs favor Republicans in state races as well.
        <p><dd>
The political community knows all about these trends, which makes the GOP's situation even cheerier. Access-hungry PACs will give heavily to Republicans. Many frustrated Democrats will retire, thereby opening a number of seats to strong Republican challenges.
        <p><dd>
Some optimistic conservatives have thus concluded that the GOP can expect a generation of political dominance. They should take another look at the 1996 returns, which offer clear signs of future trouble. In 1996, Republican House candidates got only 27 percent of the Latino vote nationwide. Previous elections yielded similar results, but the Latino electorate is growing in size and importance. Preliminary results suggest an increase in Latino turnout in 1996, at least in certain districts. The Clinton administration speeded up the naturalization of Latino resident aliens, and Democrats mounted a drive to get the new citizens to register and vote.
        <p><dd>
By 2025, says the Census Bureau, the number of Latinos will double from the current 27 million, accounting for 44 percent of the country's population growth. Not all will vote, but this dramatic demographic change will inevitably leave its mark at the polling booth. And if Democrats hold on to three-quarters of the Latino electorate, Republicans will have a growing problem.
        <p><dd>
Another trouble sign is regional. In the 1996 elections, the Northeast gave all of its electoral votes to Bill Clinton and accounted for two-thirds of the Democratic gains in the House. Among New England legislatures, Republicans control only New Hampshire, and they cling to the New York Senate only through gerrymandering. If Republicans begin to falter elsewhere, the Northeast will supply the Democrats with a firm base for revival.
        <p><dd>
In the 105th Congress, conservatives must begin a serious, long-term effort to counter such trends. They should take great care with their rhetoric: While adhering to a principled stand against illegal immigration, they must emphasize repeatedly that they are not criticizing Latinos who have arrived by lawful means. Through both legislative proposals and partisan communications, they must explain to Latinos how free-market policies benefit people who, like them, are climbing the economic ladder.
        <p><dd>
For the ecologically sensitive Northeast, conservatives need to develop the doctrine of free-market environmentalism. During the 104th Congress, Republicans stumbled when they attacked the EPA bureaucracy without explaining how they would replace command-and-control regulation with market incentives. Many voters concluded that Republicans were pro-pollution, not pro-reform. Now Republicans must show that cutting red tape does not mean befouling blue skies.
        <p><dd>
These efforts will require patience. Fortunately, conservatives have enough time, provided they remember what Joseph told Pharaoh.

<dd> Republican victories in the House and Senate would seem to indicate that the American people are moving in a conservative direction. Conservatives cannot assume, however, that a vote for Republicans is a mandate for their ideological agenda. They should remember that in exit polls during the 1994 elections, only 13 percent of voters surveyed said they had voted for Republicans. More than half had simply voted <I>against</I> Democrats. In truth, the election of 1994 was not a mandate for a Republican or conservative agenda, but an <I>opportunity</I> to develop a mandate. After that election, conservatives should have listened to the concerns of the American people. Instead, they became as insensitive to their constituents as the liberals they had replaced. It is clear, for instance, that the American people want smaller, more cost-effective government, but they didn't elect Congress to shut the government down.

<p>

<dd>Though conservatives are right in critiquing liberal policies, they must go beyond the role of opposition to offer a competing vision, communicated through powerful symbols. Time and again, liberals have defended a government-dominated agenda in the name of "saving the children." This is the political equivalent of child abuse. In fact, liberal policies have always focused on custodianship, usurping the roles of the family and community that provide a natural and sustainable system of support. They have, in effect, sentenced our nation's low-income children to a lifetime of dependency on government help. 
        <p><dd>
The conservative alternative cannot rely on ideological arguments about the excesses of government. We need a new vision to resurrect the family and the neighborhood as the primary support network for children -- as well as for adults in need. Such initiatives as the Community Renewal Act, parental choice in education, and charitable tax credits have been important steps in this direction.
        <p><dd>
Conservatives can learn a great deal from grassroots community leaders who embody conservative principles and values in their daily efforts to reclaim and revitalize their neighborhoods. One such example is Alverta Munlyn, a resident of a low-income neighborhood in Washington, D.C., where city services are notoriously inadequate. 
        <p><dd>

Although a city-run health center, which operates at a cost of $1.6 million a year, is just blocks away from Alverta's neighborhood, it has not met the medical needs of her community. Several elderly women have had their legs amputated because their diabetes went uncontrolled. One woman who was fearful that a lump in her breast might be cancerous was told that she would have to wait months to see a doctor. The clinic sometimes runs out of the insulin and syringes needed to treat diabetics and, at times, has been unable to deliver blood and urine samples to the city's medical lab because no drivers were available. The infant mortality rate, often considered a barometer of the health of a community, is four times the national average.
        <p><dd>

Alverta could not sit by as her neighborhood suffered. She developed a plan for alternative health care  --  a community-owned and operated clinic  --  and took steps to enact it. Networking with two private hospitals, Alverta secured the services of doctors as well as the use of their medical labs, X-ray facilities, and pharmacies. A site for a new clinic was chosen in an abandoned school building in the center of the neighborhood. Munlyn organized her neighbors, who raised $3 million, to prepare the building. The cost of operating this community health-care facility was projected to be one-third that of the existing clinic, saving the cash-strapped city $1 million a year.
<p><dd>
        With support from residents and city officials alike, Alverta's dream seemed close to being realized. But then it hit a roadblock: the unions of the city's service providers. A spokesperson for the 260 doctors who work for the city government warned that the clinic might interfere with plans to create a "public benefits corporation," and a labor leader from the union for city workers declared that such a clinic would result in a loss of jobs. Just two weeks after all players had signed on to this creative proposal to improve health care for the neighborhood, city officials changed their minds and blocked the health-care facility project.

Conservatives need to make common cause with America's Alverta Munlyns. How much more powerful their arguments for the devolution of resources and authority will be when they stand side by side with grassroots leaders and declare, "Here are the principles and values we promote, embodied and implemented by a resident of a low-income community." They need to market themselves in a way that will illustrate that point and will help the community.
        <p><dd>

Conservatives tend to argue that private is better than public. But the issue is not public vs. private. It is effective vs. ineffective. The effectiveness often lessens as its size and its distance from the people it serves increases. Large private charities, large private hospitals, and educational institutions can be just as indifferent and insensitive as large government. Conservatives should be in the front line, pushing devolution from large institutions to individuals and community-based civic organizations. In return for the support they offer, they will enjoy greater moral authority, because the grassroots leaders with whom they partner are the embodiment of the principles for which they stand. 
When conservatives can stand shoulder to shoulder with grassroots leaders and design their programs in accord with a practical problem-solving neighborhood initiatives, then they will deserve popular support. Otherwise, they will not, and should not, get that support.

        In his new book, James Michener writes about the predictable course of civilizations. He cites eight states of existence: genesis, exploration, accomplishment, expansion, and then loss of courage, contraction, loss of mobility, and decline. This framework builds upon Will and Ariel Durant's warning in 1944 that "a great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within. The essential causes of Rome's decline lay in her people, her morals, her class struggle, her failing trade, her bureaucratic disposition, her stifling taxes, her consuming wars."
        
<p><dd>
America, this is our wakeup call. I believe Americans are listening, but are confused by what they see.
        
<p><dd>
In the last two elections, voters have shown their support for a conservative agenda: rolling back government, reasserting traditional values, ensuring economic opportunity for all, and lifting the heavy burden of bureaucracy and regulation from our entrepreneurs. They thought that both President Clinton and Republican members of Congress offered these conservative ideals.
        <p><dd>

President Clinton did, in fact, cherry-pick our ideas and principles and make them his own. Whether it's family values, law and order, lower taxes, a balanced budget or government accountability, voters in 1996 validated the so-called "extremist" agenda of the 104th Congress. The 105th Congress must seize this national momentum toward less government and more freedom.
        <p><dd>

I remain concerned, though, that we have yet to address the more difficult challenge outlined by Michener. We cannot reassert our principles at home without coming to grips with our global policies.
        <p><dd>

As we approach the 21st century, Bill Clinton has yet to set a foreign policy. The Clinton era has been marked by inordinate attention to far-flung places like Mogadishu, Somalia; Port au Prince, Haiti; and Sarajevo, Bosnia, while the future of our children depends on what happens in Tokyo, Bonn, London, Paris, Moscow, Mexico City, and Beijing.
        <p><dd>

Conservatives must help anchor our country's foreign policy to principles of stability, predictability, and a clear vision of what the world's lone superpower should do. Some conservatives see us in a defensive crouch  --  afraid to compete because we are doomed to lose. These conservatives favor trade protectionism, withdrawal from our overseas commitments, and isolationism.
        <p><dd>

I reject that vision. Our challenge is to establish a foreign and defense policy that is consistent with a bold, confident America not in retreat, as Michener warns, but standing tall astride the globe, expansive but not expansionist. Fundamental to such a policy is knowing when to put American lives at risk. Answering this question is the first step toward defining a coherent national security policy. Absent that, we lapse into an increasingly dangerous pattern: reinventing our national security policies, issue by issue, crisis by crisis.
        <p><dd>
We must develop a systematic policy for U.S. engagement, so that our actions in a crisis will be predictable for both our allies and our detractors. President Richard Nixon established that the United States would commit its military forces overseas:

<p><ul>
<li> To honor treaty commitments;
<p>
<li> To provide a nuclear umbrella to protect the world from weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, or biological);

<p>
<li> To supply weapons and technical assistance to other countries where warranted -- but not commit American forces to local conflicts; 

<p>
<li> To protect American citizens in a crisis.

</ul>
        <p><dd>
Together with former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger's doctrine of how to deploy force  --  overwhelmingly and confidently  --  these principles form a good foundation for a 21st-century security policy. Desert Shield and Desert Storm were based on these convictions. 
<p><dd>
        Yet President Bush's great victory stands in stark contrast to the way his successor has managed the civil war in Bosnia. Neither our allies nor our adversaries know what to expect of the United States. This vacuum of unpredictability pulled us into Bosnia. Our policy did not create the vacuum; the vacuum created the U.S. policy. We allowed others to set conditions for American leadership, and we ended up placing thousands of American troops in an area where we have no security interests. We must distinguish between a U.S. interest, which we do have in Bosnia, and a U.S. security interest, which we do not. Deployment of troops should hinge on the latter not the former.
<p><dd>

Integral to our conservative vision of engagement in the world must be a trade policy that is also continually advancing. NAFTA and GATT are good first steps, but there is more to be done. The future of our global leadership depends on free trade, and this administration's record is meager. We must strengthen the Western Hemispheric trade alliance and commit to an hemispheric free-trade agreement by the end of the century. Why not engage Japan and China with free and fair trade, instead of managing our trade relationships issue by issue, product by product? No engine of economic growth is more powerful than trade. It is waiting to be engaged. 
        <p><dd>

Finally, we have always helped victims of disaster  --  natural and man-made, and we should continue to do so. But we must distinguish between humanitarian efforts and national security interests, between our commitment to peace for others and our commitment to strength for our children's future.
        <p><dd>

America is obligated to continue to inspire democracy in other countries, as we have done for more than two centuries. We will accomplish this by promoting our virtues, expanding commerce through trade, and vigorously identifying and defending our vital interests, not by needlessly sacrificing our sons and daughters or draining our resources in ankle-biting civil wars.
        <p><dd>

This is our duty as Americans. And this must be our vision in Congress as we take the helm of America's journey into the new millennium.

        History will record the failure of the Democrats to win back control of either House of Congress as the story of the 1996 elections. Conservatives have successfully repelled the liberal counterattack following the 1994 elections, and on many fronts actually gained strength. Traditional Democratic liberalism is moribund.

<dd>Conservatives actually gained strength in many areas. In the U.S. Senate, conservatives gained seven seats, including Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, and two from Kansas. In spite of the loss of 67 state legislative seats and control of some legislative houses, the party's gains of more than 600 state legislative seats in the last two years are essentially intact.
        <p><dd>
In the 90 or so referenda around the country, conservatives won, too. The California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI) leads the list, and tough tax limitations passed in half a dozen states while green initiatives failed. And it's no accident that the only two successful Democratic presidential candidates in the second half of the 20th century  --  Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton  --  were Southerners who campaigned as the most conservative of the candidates in the Democratic primaries, and then ran moderate-conservative presidential campaigns. President Clinton got elected in 1992 as the candidate of the middle-class income-tax cut who would "end welfare as we know it." In 1996, he wanted to balance the budget, fight crime, and end teenage drug abuse. 
<p><dd>
        So where to from here? Congress will likely begin by presenting the President with legislation that, at one time or another, he has supported. The middle-class tax cut is a prime candidate for prompt action. Fighting teenage drug abuse is another. In 1996, all the candidates talked about crime. It remains to be seen whether something can be done about it at the federal level without repeating the problems of the last crime bill. Continued, careful progress toward a balanced budget and regulatory reform are also good bets.
        <p><dd>
Liberals, frustrated with the political success of the "leave us alone" coalition, will probably eschew costly new governmental programs and embrace employer mandates and other indirect methods of satisfying their constituencies. Liberals will try to achieve their social objectives through employer mandates in the health-care arena as well as through the regulation of telecommunications and energy. Another danger is Jesse Jackson's suggestion at the Democrat National Convention that if only 5 percent of the $6 trillion in private pension funds could be tapped, social activists could reap a $300 billion windfall. Employers and employees, watch your pension funds!
        
<p><dd>
Besides conservative legislative successes, the elections of 1994 and 1996 will also encourage individual freedom, private solutions, and local responsibility to deal with our nation's challenges in the next two years. Already educational-choice initiatives and experiments are flourishing throughout the country. Educational-choice programs will continue until eventually, like the Berlin Wall, the government monopoly of our children's education will collapse into rubble  --  and with it the teachers unions.
        
<p><dd>
Nor is it any longer impossible to contemplate the first baby steps toward moving our nation's government retirement system slowly toward to a more private system. Over the next four years, these steps will comprise expansion of IRAs and 401(k)s and tax benefits for private systems. As this shift occurs, the next generation of Americans will realize that there is a better way to plan for their retirement than relying on the government. They will be its strongest supporters. 
<p><dd> 
A final prediction: Eventually the U.S. Postal Service will also be stripped of its monopoly and replaced by a more private system.
<p><dd>

        And what will be the legacy of the first Democratic president re-elected since Franklin Roosevelt? If he can avoid the perils of Whitewater, it seems a good bet that Clinton's finely honed political instincts will tell him which way the wind blows, and history will say, "Oh, he was there, too."

Conservatives should understand the following lessons from the 1996 elections: American voters (and the stock market) prefer divided government. For 30 of the past 50 years, at least one house of Congress has been controlled by a different party than that of the president, and this pattern will now continue for at least two more years. Most voters, I suggest, do not wholly trust either major party and prefer those policy outcomes that require a bipartisan agreement to those approved by a partisan majority.

<dd>The election strengthened the status quo distribution of political power. President Clinton was re-elected. The Republicans won a few seats in the Senate and lost a few seats in the House. There was no change in the number of state governors by party. The conservative-libertarian shift reflected in the 1994 election was neither repudiated nor strengthened; the voters are willing to give conservatives another chance but not an unlimited line of credit.
        <p><dd>
A final lesson is more a consequence of the passage of time than of the election: Almost all the old-guard Republican senators have now retired. The new Republican leaders in the Senate are younger, more conservative, and more like their counterparts in the House. This should make it easier to coordinate Republican policy positions and tactics between the House and the Senate.
        <p><dd>

Strategy for the 105th Congress should be based on a recognition <i>that the 104th Congress was unusually successful</i>. Congress approved several important reforms of congressional procedures that were part of the Contract With America and are likely to survive: subjecting Congress to laws that apply to other employers, limiting unfunded mandates, granting the president a line item veto, and establishing a process for reviewing and blocking major new regulations. The 104th Congress also approved the most important substantive legislation in 60 years affecting agriculture, telecommunications, and welfare. This record should prove that divided government is not a barrier to substantial reform. Conservatives made their major recent mistakes when they abandoned their principles to resolve some ephemeral crisis or to avoid controversy in the rush to adjourn.
<p><dd>

        My list of issues that the 105th Congress should address is too long to summarize briefly; those who are interested can read the new <i>Cato Handbook for Congress</i>. I do have a short list, however, of measures that conservatives should not initiate:
<p><dd>

<b>1. Do not initiate a Medicare reform proposal.</b> Clinton has fouled his own nest on this issue; let him sort this program out on his own without the cover of a bipartisan commission.
<p><dd>

<b>2. Do not press the social conservative agenda.</b> Most of these issues can and should be sorted out by state and local governments.
<p><dd>
        <b>3. Do not initiate new hearings on old scandals.</b> Let special counsel Kenneth Starr and the courts deal with these charges. The authority of Congress to hold hearings on the behavior of public officials is more valuable as a club in the closet. Try a cooperative strategy first; it might be productive, and you don't really want to deal with a President Gore.
<p><dd>

        The 1996 election set the stage for continued progress on the conservative agenda. I worry more about missed opportunities than setbacks. I doubt if Clinton will propose any major new domestic initiative; the danger of a misconceived foreign venture is much greater. The conservatives' biggest challenge is capturing the moral high ground from those who exhibit compassion by spending other people's money, from those who propose an expansion of government power in response to almost any perceived problem.

If conservatives are serious about reducing the cost and size of government, we must ask ourselves how government came to be so large and so expensive in the first place. The answer is that many conservatives were as happy as liberals to cede to government what had been the primary responsibility of individuals and charities.

<dd>Every study I've seen suggests that the premier problems in America are not economic and political, but moral and spiritual. Their solutions will not be found inside the Beltway, but inside the human heart. In fact, putting American families back together again would do more to solve social ills and reduce government's size and cost than any other proposal I've heard.
        <p><dd>So what's a conservative to do following a mixed-message election?

<p><dd> 
First, the congressional Republican majority must seize from Democrats the compassion issue, which has allowed them to denounce even reductions in spending increases as insensitive to grandmothers and little children. To do this, Republican leaders should call a summit meeting with the nation's religious leaders asking them to reclaim their former (even God-mandated) role of feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and visiting those in prison. The clergy should be given lists of those local families and individuals receiving public assistance and encouraged to begin the process of redemption in those lives. Marvin Olasky's <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i> could serve as a textbook for those who don't recall how religiously based societies fought poverty a century ago.
<p><dd>

        Nothing will kill liberalism and its costly programs quicker than a reduction in the perceived need for such programs. And nothing will rekindle compassion in people's hearts more quickly than a chance to help another person rebuild his or her life. Reducing the need for programs should at least parallel, if not precede, reducing the programs. Otherwise, Democrats will accuse Republicans of lacking compassion and reprise the battle over Medicare reform. When compassion is the issue, Democrats always win. But if the need for the welfare state is diminished, Republicans can cut programs and get credit for proper stewardship of the taxpayers' money.
        <p><dd>

Next, Republicans should continue to explain that the reason so many families earn two incomes is that one parent works to support the family while the other must pay the family tax bill. Bob Dole tried to sell that message during his campaign, but he was a poor salesman. The message, however, remains a good one -- if it is not seen as selfishness.
        <p><dd>

Freeing families from their huge tax burden would expand choices and opportunities and relieve some of the pressures that sometimes lead to divorce or neglect of the children. Such a policy could quickly close the "gender gap."
        <p><dd>
The 104th Congress suffered from nearsightedness. The Republican majority was so excited about the end of 40 years of wandering in the political wilderness that its exuberance overwhelmed sound judgment. Great social movements take time, but the GOP majority treated change like fast food when it should have found the time and ingredients necessary for a gourmet meal. Or, to use another metaphor, after four decades submerged under the welfare state, the conservative agenda rose too fast and suffered the political equivalent of the bends.
        <p><dd>
The biggest danger in a second Clinton term is the fate of the Supreme Court. Liberalism's worst excesses have come through the federal judiciary, not the legislative branch. The congressional majority should apply "strict scrutiny" to the records of Clinton nominees. A high rating from the American Bar Association is no reason for automatic confirmation, especially if the nominee's rulings favor Big Government at a time when voters want to reduce its size and cost.
        <p><dd>
Above all, Republicans must keep the public informed about what they are doing. Never again should they wait too long to respond to Democrat lies, distortions, and demagoguery. In addition to appearances on the regular news shows with their slanted questioners, Republicans should get their message out through year-round advertising on TV and in newspapers, pounding it home over the defenses of a hostile media, a disingenuous and sometimes lying Democratic leadership, and a shameless president.
        <p><dd>
Since the New Deal era, liberals have peddled a perverted form of the 23rd Psalm: The government is my keeper, I shall not want. Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of poverty, the Health and Human Services department is there, comforting me with food stamps and AFDC payments.
        <p><dd>

Republicans should counter this from the bottom up, highlighting success stories and role models and encouraging others to emulate good behavior. Congress might experiment with incentives in the form of tax credits or outright cash gifts to companies and individuals who succeed in relieving government of the burdens of maintaining a welfare state.
        <p><dd>

Congress cannot do any of this alone. The conservative movement should ask something of every American -- but without using the word "sacrifice." We are investing in our future and our children's future, not with more money, but with more of ourselves.

        Americans are deeply divided between two competing visions of government. One of them, clearly, is conservative -- limited government, deregulation, decentralization, lower taxes, and reduced government spending together forming a sometimes uneasy alliance with conservative positions on "social issues." The other vision is not easily characterized, partly because it is not yet fully formed. It is not liberalism -- liberalism cannot speak its name in American politics today. But neither is it liberalism-in-disguise, as many conservatives apparently believe. Elements of both the honest and the veiled liberalism survive, but their influence has diminished. The Democratic Party today not only wishes to be seen as having moved to the right; it <I>has</I> moved to the right. But that does not mean it has moved into anything like conservative territory.

<dd><b>The trouble behind.</b> The most conspicuous failure of the 104th Congress was its irresistible impulse to set its actions in a broader context. There is nothing wrong, and much right, about cutting taxes, cutting spending, deregulating. and so on. People like those things fine all by themselves. It is not necessary to try to persuade them that these changes are the Third Wave, or that they are consistent with libertarian philosophy, or that the streets should run red with the blood of counterrevolutionaries. Republicans had become so persuaded that they were speaking to Everyman's real concerns -- and they were, by the way -- that they imagined that they were doing so every time they opened their mouths. In this remarkably honest period in American politics, there was occasionally such a thing as too much candor. This is a case not for dishonesty, but for less matter and more art.
<p><dd>

<b>The trouble ahead.</b> It is impossible to know what legislation President Clinton might sign. Some have advocated waiting for him to make the first move on controversial issues like Medicare reform, so that Republicans won't take it on the chin in the realm of public opinion. This may work in some areas, but it lets Clinton pick the space he will work in.
<p><dd>

        Far better to let a hundred flowers bloom on the Republican side. Legislate, legislate, legislate. Keep sending him tax cuts until he finally likes one well enough to sign it, and then send him the rest anyway. There are, to be sure, certain practical obstacles, such as the senate filibuster wielded by Minority Leader Tom Daschle. But idle hands are the devil's workshop, so Republicans ought to busy themselves on Republican things.
<p><dd>

The danger for conservatives is that Bill Clinton and Al Gore may delineate and capture a political space somewhere to the right of the Left but to the left of the Right, and that this space contains enough votes to allow Democrats to rebuild a majority coalition. The new Democratic policy agenda is unlikely to contain anything like government-guaranteed health insurance, huge stimulus packages, or massive job-training programs. The more likely model for Democrats is the Family and Medical Leave Act -- a program that is mandate-laden but unbureaucratic, pitched to middle-class concerns, and much harder to attack than massive programs like ClintonCare.
        <p><dd>

The best way to avoid that trap, once again, is to keep Republicans at work on Republican things. If a united Democratic congressional caucus and White House reach across the aisle to Republicans more often than Republicans reach across to Democrats, then conservatism is in trouble.

        The electorate, sometimes a brutal tutor, has been kind to the Republicans. The lesson of the 1996 election is that the American people generally support the direction the party is traveling in, but are worried about the driving. Don't change direction, they are saying, your policies are sensible and necessary. But slow down and navigate more carefully. This republic is not the land of revolutionary jihads.

<dd>Three areas require attention: mindset, message, and messenger. Republicans must think and talk in the language, not of revolution, but of governmental reform and social renaissance. The past two years proved just how natural is the impulse among conservatives to oppose rather than propose. For decades, this tendency was well honed through the daily practice of confronting the totalitarian state abroad and the welfare state at home. The former is now functionally gone, the latter is at least ideologically spent. 
        <p><dd>

The challenge now is to create something new -- a humane and viable American society. The resuscitation of society is dramatically different work than the demolition of government. A society ravaged by cultural decay and social regression needs a politics of persuasion and prudence. Republicans must quickly evolve from political wrecking balls to architects of a prudently redesigned federal system and a revived civil society.
        <p><dd>

All this requires a different message. To use a football analogy, American politics is played between the 40-yard lines. The greatest gains for conservatism came in convincing the country that liberals had pulled America and the Democratic party too far to the left. These converts to conservatism were not looking to replace the ideological stridency of the Left with a rigid triumphalism of the Right. What they wanted was nonideological common sense, which is what conservatism has historically been about.
At stake is nothing less than a realignment that favors conservative ideas. America will be governed from neither the Left nor Right, but from the middle, albeit a middle dramatically redefined by conservatism. On a host of domestic policy issues -- welfare, crime, affirmative action, taxes, and decentralization -- today's center was yesterday's Right. Properly guided, these trends can be guided toward more important reforms, from downsizing government to voucherizing housing and health care to privatizing retirement programs. 
        <p><dd>

Finally, regarding the messenger, Republicans must think generationally. Half of Clinton's advantage was generational -- he embodied the <I>Zeitgeist</I> of the Baby Boomers, and to a lesser extent of Generation Xers. For the vast majority of the new electorate, the complexity and diversity of life obscures core certainties. The great temptation in an age of complexity is nostalgia. If the conceit of the Left is that it often ignores the past, the folly of some on the Right is thinking we can live in the past. 
<p><dd>

        The Republican party should skip a generation or two in its leadership to bring up talented women, minorities, and young people. To think that Republicans can govern for long on the Anglo vote alone is fantasy. The party must find a way to connect its principles to the aspirations of new generations and emerging constituencies. Hence the party would be unwise to nominate anyone over the age of 55 in the next presidential campaign. 
        <p><dd>

The greatest legislative priority of the new Congress must be entitlement reform. Republicans need to seize the historic moment to craft a bipartisan package to reform Medicare and Social Security. This is both a moral imperative and a political opportunity. There is a new antientitlement constituency forming, led by Generation X, which is deeply concerned about the crushing burden of debt it will carry. Entitlement politics are already beginning to shift as politicians are forced to pay greater attention to this emerging generation.
        <p><dd>

Republicans must also address the threat that judicial review poses to constitutional balance. Increasingly, the courts have arrogated to themselves the power to decide controversial moral and political questions. The result has been a serious erosion of self-government and of the credibility of the judiciary. To avoid a constitutional crisis, we will need to restore judicial restraint. This might well require congressional action to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts. Ultimately, the success of such efforts will depend upon increased conservative influence in America's culture-forming institutions, particularly the academy and the legal profession. 
        <p><dd>

Finally, we must recognize that many of our urgent national problems can't be solved through legislative fiat. Our efforts instead should be directed toward facilitating the efforts of citizens to solve problems at the local level. For example, Republicans need to develop and refine policies which encourage local involvement and private charity. The nation is on the verge of a historic turn-of-the-century civic and moral transformation, promising to curb teen pregnancy, renew fatherhood, recover character, and inspire faith-based charity.
        <p><dd>
Republicans have been in the classroom, cramming for two years of tests in parliamentary skills that the other party perfected over 50 years. Confounding the naysayers, it has received pretty decent grades and is now poised to excel.

        The election of 1996 demonstrated that when candidates articulate and believe in a conservative agenda, they generally win. When candidates take contradictory positions on major issues and convey with their every action that their positions are campaign props and not a reflection of their core beliefs, they generally lose. The American public clearly supports a conservative agenda of lower taxes, a balanced budget, and strong action against crime and drugs. The re-election of President Clinton is a testament to the essentially conservative message he adopted (tax cuts, balanced budget, welfare reform, school uniforms, et cetera), and to Bob Dole's implausible stand as a pro-growth presidential candidate.
<p><dd>

        In hindsight, it is clear that the crowning achievement of Republicans in the 104th Congress was the Contract With America. Their biggest mistake, however, was their failure to articulate a second Contract. Once the Contract votes were completed, congressional Republicans lost their momentum. And the GOP erred in selecting Medicare as the key issue of the 104th Congress. The Democrats were able to step into this vacuum with liberal issues such as health care and the minimum wage. Without a unified position, the Republicans were left looking defensive and divided.
        <p><dd>

Republicans must offer the public an agenda for the next two years. They would be wise to force President Clinton to offer a detailed Medicare rescue plan, but wait-and-see is not a sensible long-term strategy. The Republican agenda should include cutting taxes across the board, rolling back regulatory burdens that afflict small business and individuals, eliminating federal intrusion into education and the arts, combating drugs, and affirming the rights of parents.
        <p><dd>
As well, someone in Congress should step forward and defend the right of individuals to have fun. If adults enjoy smoking or drinking, let them. If we expect adults to sacrifice their lives on foreign soil and turn over half of their income to the government in taxes, they should at least be entitled to smoke if they so desire without fear of condemnation by the FDA or the president of the United States. Similarly, if someone likes to collect guns or hunt -- or even wear fur coats, let them. It is, after all, a free country. Politicians should stand up to the politically correct. Fun-loving Americans across the nation would applaud.

        Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the 1996 election is that half of the registered voters didn't bother to show up. The 1996 elections saw the lowest percentage of voter turnout since l924. That suggests that neither political party is connecting with the American public. Without recognizing it, both parties may already be on life-support systems. Most candidates refused to discuss the values-related issues that contributed to the large increase in turnout in 1994. Absent that, many voters saw little difference between the Republicans and the Democrats. Thus, when we hear about President Clinton's "mandate," it is helpful to keep in mind that only about 24 percent of the total eligible electorate voted him back into office.

<dd>Was Bob Dole's defeat inevitable as some of his supporters are now saying? The Zogby poll, the only one which was right on the money, suggested otherwise. A week before the election, Bill Clinton was attracting only 44 percent of the vote. Bob Dole was within striking distance. He simply didn't connect. Voters gave him every chance to tell them why he should be elected President instead of Bill Clinton. He never did so in a fashion that could be easily understood by the voters.
        <p><dd>

The election of 1996 is significant because it is the first time that Republicans have kept control of the Congress in back-to-back elections since 1928, and because Republicans held on to most of the ground they gained in state legislatures in the 1994 elections and subsequent defections by Democrats. It is extraordinary that Republicans lost only 67 state legislative seats nationwide (net), after gaining more than 600 seats from 1994 to 1996. Many of those losses were in New Hampshire's huge house of representatives, as well as in Vermont and Maine, so the actual number of chambers affected was relatively small. 
        <p><dd>

The election results of 1994 were not, as the media contended, a fluke, and not likely to be reversed soon. Indeed, 1998 will be the six-year-itch of the Clinton administration. Throughout U.S. history (except during the Civil War, every party that occupies the White House over an eight-year span suffers significant losses in the sixth year of that cycle. That means Republicans should be able to look forward to controlling the Congress at least until the year 2000. That fact alone will cause many older Democrats, who were used to power and who have been in limbo for the past two years, to throw in the towel in 1998. Republican opportunities will be legion, although the weakest Senate incumbents of both parties are up for re-election in 1998.
        <p><dd>

The 1996 elections have produced a more ideologically-polarized House and Senate. Newly-elected Republicans are more conservative than the retiring congressional incumbents they replace. Newly-elected Democrats are more liberal than their predecessors. As a result, fewer moderates remain in both chambers.
<p><dd>

        So now what comes next? So far, Republicans have behaved correctly since the election. It is time for Bill Clinton to take responsibility for governing the country. If he moves left, he will become again as unpopular as he was in his first term. If he moves right, he will enrage his base. Either way, Republicans would do well to make no moves until Clinton is forced to take a stand.
        <p><dd>

Organized labor is the big loser in the election. It spent a fortune (probably $300 million or more) to win back the Congress. It failed. The Religious Right saved the Republicans, but some in the GOP have already drawn the long knives to further disassociate the party from issues of concern to social conservatives. The Republican establishment risks precipitating a new party if they persist on alienating these conservatives.
        <p><dd>

Our military continues to suffer greatly under the Clinton regime. We have been blessed by not having any world threats we can't handle. It is amazing that we got through the first four years of Clinton without a major collapse. If Clinton stretches American forces any thinner, however, that collapse is nigh.
The most dangerous outcome of the 1996 election is that by the time he leaves office, Bill Clinton will have had the opportunity to appoint nearly 60 percent of the federal judiciary (if he lasts the whole term, and I believe he will not). He may get to appoint three more Supreme Court justices. If so, the Clinton legacy will linger for more than another generation. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has warned Bill Clinton that he had better temper the sort of judges he is sending up for Senate confirmation. It will take only 41 of the 55 GOP Senators to block a confirmation.
        <p><dd>

And what of the Clinton scandals? Most Republicans are interpreting the elections as a message from voters to ease up on their investigations. I don't see it that way. Of course Republicans need to be careful how they go about their investigations, but I think it would be a dreadful mistake for the GOP to surrender this territory to Clinton.

Exactly what did this last election tell us about what the American people want? Half the American people -- the nonvoters -- didn't tell us directly what they want. But their indifference tells us that no one has reached their minds and hearts.

<dd>Half the people who did vote chose to re-elect a moderate-sounding Bill Clinton because he is a man of the '90s and seems to understand us. But they retained a Republican House and Senate because the economy is doing pretty well and because President Clinton is a little loose with the truth and the national checkbook. 
<p><dd>
        The American people don't want their entitlements axed, but neither do they want to pay for loafers on welfare. They want regulatory barriers lifted, but not if it means relaxing environmental standards. 
<p><dd>
        Voters embraced a moderate to conservative campaign message. Gone were radical social policies and government-run health-care plans. Suddenly tax cuts were a good idea and the budget deficit could be reduced in less than 10 years. President Clinton was spouting lines like: "Families are the foundation of American life."
<p><dd>
        Voters heard a message they liked -- a conservative message of tax cuts, balanced budgets, welfare reform, tough crime policies, education choices, family values, and neighborhood and personal charity -- all items on the agenda of the 104th Congress.
<p><dd>
        So how did Bill Clinton replace his abysmal record with that of the 104th Congress? Conservative leaders in Congress failed to remind Americans in simple, compelling language, what they were doing and why they were doing it. They used the language of the head and forgot about the heart. Clinton co-opted the successes of the 104th Congress, got on his white horse, and took the high road to the White House, while his henchmen in Big Labor did the dirty work.
<p><dd>
        The lesson for the 105th Congress is that it was not the meat of the conservative message that troubled voters, but the presentation. The 105th Congress need not please everybody -- just the majority of voters who sent conservative lawmakers back to Congress and sent a conservative-sounding president back to the White House. 
<p><dd>
        Conservatives should call the president's bluff on his campaign promises. They should refuse to discuss compromises until Clinton offers the budget he discussed during the 1996 campaign. For example, the president said he would agree to balance the budget in seven years. This means the federal government will spend about a trillion fewer dollars between now and 2004. Conservatives should hold the president to his agreement. 
<p><dd>
        If the 105th Congress wants to take big or controversial actions, like wiping out a whole federal department, it must do so early and completely. If, instead, the budget for an agency slated for the scrap heap is merely cut, special interests will the opportunity to mobilize against those "mean conservatives." 
<p><dd>
        We can expect to see more of Bill Clinton's "triangulation" strategy -- steering a course between conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats. If Republicans do not have a clear game plan, Clinton will get 75 percent of what he wants and conservatives will get 25 percent. Both will declare victory. Conservatives need a sensible agenda with a compassionate public face.
<p><dd>
        The 105th Congress can expect labor unions and liberals to seek government-run health care. A unified front of special interests will try to block entitlement cuts and a Balanced Budget Amendment. The payoff for labor's campaign spending will be pension "reform" and federal protection from independent contractors. Stronger environmental regulations will be proposed. The National Education Association will insist that the federal government use the public-education system to provide health care and day care for all preschool children.
<p><dd>
        Liberals are opening a can of worms. But conservatives can use worms to bait their own hooks.

        In re-electing GOP majorities in both houses of Congress, the American people rejected the scare tactics of the Left and ratified its movement toward limited government. The Big Government coalition, however, will not disappear in the 105th Congress. The greatest menace to the conservative agenda over the next two years is the White House, aided by the Left's deft and well-funded demagoguery.

<dd>After seeing his grand health-care scheme go down in flames, while other initiatives such as the minimum-wage hike and the Kennedy-Kassebaum health-care reform sailed through the Congress, President Clinton and his allies will aim to expand government a little at a time. Instead of openly attempting to socialize health care or the workplace, for example, President Clinton will likely emerge during his second term as an "aggressive incrementalist." 
<p><dd>
        "Aggressive incrementalism" remains the president's most practical option to appease the Democrat Party's left wing. It is a crafty way to avoid the label of "Big Government liberal" while offering to ease the life of middle-class families. These initiatives -- mostly in the form of mandates on business -- will be sold individually as little ways that employers should help their workers. But as most businesses know, the weight of all these "little ways" add up to big costs. Of course, any new mandate on business, especially in the area of workplace issues, presents a new opportunity for employment lawyers to exploit these foggy areas of the law. President Clinton gets a "twofer" -- he pleases both Big Labor and the trial lawyers.
<p><dd>
        These incremental reforms include an expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act; universal health insurance for children; a six-month health-care safety net for the "temporarily unemployed"; and a list of other health insurance requirements like mastectomies (following the recent law requiring 48-hour hospital stays for new mothers and mandating parity for mental-health coverage). And, of course, government agencies will move forward with their own aggressive rulemaking. From indoor-air quality to ergonomics and the like, Big Labor will be pushing government bureaucrats to micromanage our workplaces like never before.
<p><dd>
        President Clinton will likely move ahead with various executive orders to pay back key political supporters like labor and the environmental lobby. Chairman William Gould of the National Labor Relations Board will continue to act as a labor advocate rather than an impartial arbiter of labor law. For example, he will aggressively promote his "single-site organizing rule" to make it easier for unions to organize small businesses.
<p><dd>
        
The aggressive incrementalists can be stopped. With the passage of the Congressional Review Act and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, regulatory agencies have been curbed on paper, but Congress needs to make sure the agencies are complying with the new laws. Congress must show due diligence to ensure that regulators are not operating uncontrollably (as they now are). If it fulfills its oversight function aggressively, Congress has the tools to slow down the pace of regulation.
<p><dd>

        Now that everyone "agrees" that government is too big, conservatives have a great opportunity to further cut government spending. Corporate welfare is the perfect place to start, but Republicans and Democrats alike must join to wean their friends in business from the government dole.
<p><dd>

        Small businesses continue to support a big cut in the capital-gains tax. Cutting the tax in half is the best thing Congress and the president can do to spur growth. If an economic slowdown becomes the main issue of the 1998 mid-term elections, Clinton will deepen his party's losses in the House and Senate.  A cut in the capital-gains tax is his best insurance against the possibility that an economic downturn may threaten the health of both the economy and his party.

        The 1996 election was simply not a referendum on public policy. The Left learned in 1994 not to fight elections on the issues. President Clinton so obscured the policy differences between conservatives and liberals that the public did not perceive that any such differences existed. 
        <p><dd>
Unfortunately, most Republicans actually helped him in this regard; very few ran on the principles embodied in the party's Contract With America. Apparently intentionally, they failed to make the case that the Contract needed to be augmented and extended.
        <p><dd>
Exit polling suggests that those who voted for Clinton were not supporting any particular policy or even policy direction. Clinton voters voted primarily on personality issues and their perceived self-interest as members of a favored group. The old political bromides were correct on this point: In times of relative prosperity, voters seldom see a need to take any political risk or to tolerate significant change. Republicans failed to supply the incentive necessary to induce voters to inconvenience themselves. And, of course, Bill Clinton was the perfect candidate for a media-intense age marked by voter apathy. 
        <p><dd>
Clinton's core liberal constituencies hope that this lame-duck president will now have an unfettered opportunity to enact the liberal agenda. However, Republicans were granted legislative majorities to prevent this. Their task probably won't be difficult. For one thing, the press is much less likely to protect a president who faces no more elections and whose past behavior may very well yield Pulitzer Prize material to enterprising reporters. 
        <p><dd>
A much more perplexing problem for conservatives is how to achieve important public-policy goals such as the structural reform of Medicare, restraint of federal spending (including defunding the Left), tort reform, and the reduction or elimination of the federal role in education. These issues all involve tradeoffs between short-term political concerns and lasting results. Conservatives must figure out how to take their case directly to the people, emphasizing our courage and contrasting that with the shortsightedness of the president and his backers.
        <p><dd>
Conservatives need to explain to voters that we are not so much anti-government as ungovernment. For example, our vision of welfare reform is not improving the design of the program, but truly getting the government out of the business of inducing dependency. In education, we favor control by parents, not bureaucrats, and we believe that teachers and principals, not administrators, should set policy. We do not stop to calculate whether we can "pay for" tax cuts, but rather insist that we are reducing the ultimate government intrusion into personal economic affairs.
        <p><dd>

We also need to take our legislative victories wherever we find them and keep moving the policy debate to the right. Home runs are great, but they're not the only way to win. We should not fear to appear doctrinaire or radical when speaking the truth. We should always contrast ourselves with politicians and bureaucrats. Ours is a message of hope and optimism that can appeal to a public weary of business as usual.

<center><h2>RIGHT TO KILL NOT OBVIOUS IN CONSTITUTION,</h2>
<h4>CLEAVER NOTES HIGH COURT CONCERNED WITH WHO DECIDES<br>
WHO DIES -- AND WHY</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In today's euthanasia case before the
U.S. Supreme Court, the justices made the most pro-states' rights
arguments heard in years, noted Family Research Council Director
of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver on Wednesday. Cleaver attended
the arguments as attorney of record for FRC which filed a brief
in the case.

<p>

&quot;The justices seemed reluctant to seize the power of life
and death. The nature of the justices' questions seemed to indicate
that they were concerned about imposing a blanket ruling on the
complex issue of arming physicians with a right to kill,&quot;
Cleaver said. &quot;The court also relied heavily on the centuries-old
tradition that doctors should be healers and not killers. We agree.&quot;

<p>

For example: Justice David Souter asked the attorney general from
Washington state about how the court could weigh the risks of
empowering physicians with a right to kill and how it could be
controlled. The attorney general replied that we can look at the
Netherlands and Germany and see that death could not be contained
... it's been &quot;tried and failed.&quot;

<p>

(Editor's note: Family Research Council's amicus brief dealt with
the historical record of the culture of euthanasia -- so called
&quot;good death&quot; -- in Germany which was expanded from the
killing of the handicapped, elderly and mentally ill to the killing
of others deemed undesirable.)

<p>

Justice Souter commented that the court might want to wait until
it could understand the ramifications of such a decision. Justice
Stephen Breyer, talking about what he learned in the many amicus
briefs, noted that good pain control was available and that almost
all of the 25 percent of people who die in pain, do so needlessly.
The justice asked whether it was right to assume that if we create
a right to assisted suicide, will that not be a disincentive to
improve pain care? Justice Breyer got into the cost of medical
care, mentioning that it would certainly be cheaper to give a
lethal dose than to give aggressive treatment.

<p>

Cleaver noted, &quot;The justices as a whole were very concerned
about whether giving physicians the power to kill was something
for the courts to decide at all or something for states to decide
democratically after discussion and study.&quot;

<p>

Along those lines, Justice Antonin Scalia noted that those favoring
physician-assisted death claim that it would be confined to the
terminally ill, in insufferable pain, who competently request
death. He asked, if you want to legalize a physician's ability
to kill, why would the U.S. Constitution narrowly define those
with a right to die? He asked, if pain gives a person the right
to die, why should the line be drawn with the terminally ill?
Why should those who will be in pain for a 10-year illness be
denied? By what reasoning do you prevent the death right from
expanding?

<p>

&quot;The High Court is clearly weighing the tough questions surrounding
granting physicians the power to kill. There is no greater issue
facing a people than who has the power to take life. It is of
paramount importance that all Americans can trust that the medical
profession is devoted to saving life -- not destroying it,&quot;
Cleaver said.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

Here's a chilling phrase.  &quot;Lives unworthy of being lived&quot;
-- that's the translation of a German phrase that goes all the
way back to 1920.  That's when influential German doctors advocated
a euthanasia program.  The mentally retarded, people who were
insane, and terribly wounded World War I veterans were the first
victims.  Later this same philosophy was used by Adolph Hitler
and served as the philosophical foundation for the Holocaust.

<p>

Today, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in two
euthanasia cases. It is just weeks before we observe the twenty-fourth
anniversary of the Court's infamous <I>Roe v. Wade</I> decision.
That unjust decision gave us partial-birth abortions and the
death of 30 million unborn children.  And it has seriously undermined
the respect that we should give to the courts.

<p>

America is not Germany.  But we must take care not to remove
those safeguards that have historically protected vulnerable lives.
Remember, the oldest rule in medicine: &quot;Do no harm.&quot;
If we forget it, the so-called right to die will become a right
to be killed.

<p>

For Family Research Council, this is Gary Bauer with today's
Washington Watch.  For more information about us, call 1-800-225-4008.
That number again:  1-800-225-4008.<BR>

<H3>CUTTING CRIME AND RESTORING ORDER:
WHAT AMERICA CAN LEARN FROM
NEW YORK'S FINEST</H3>
by William J. Bratton<br>
Delivered October 15, 1996
<P>
<DD>William J. Bratton served as Commissioner of Police for New York City from 1994 to 1996. He spoke at The Heritage Foundation on October 15, 1996, as part of a conference entitled "If New York Can Cut Crime by 36%, Why Can't D.C.?"
<P>
<DD><B>Edwin Meese III:</B> William J. Bratton is one of the most distinguished law enforcement leaders in the United States today. While serving as Commissioner of Police for New York City from 1994 to 1996, Bill Bratton successfully instituted major management initiatives and the strategic deployment of public safety resources. During this period, the city achieved a phenomenal 36 percent decrease in serious crime, including a 45 percent drop in murder. Commissioner Bratton previously had served as the chief executive of other large law enforcement agencies, including the Boston Police Department and the New York City Transit Police. Widely respected by his professional colleagues, he was elected president of the Police Executive Research Forum, a leading institute of modern police management. Bill Bratton continues his efforts in the private sector as a foremost authority on effective law enforcement and the improvement of public safety.
<P>
<DD><B>William J. Bratton:</B> I am an optimist when it comes to the issue of crime in this country.  I believe that over the last several years we have begun to find answers to a problem for which many felt there were no answers. We have begun to turn the corner, and American police forces are becoming better at what they do. I think society, in general, understands more significantly what causes crime, what can be done about it, and -- most important, from my perspective as a former police official -- what police departments can be expected to accomplish.
<P>
<DD>
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, I had the privilege of working at Harvard University on an initiative with <a href="/heritage/staff/meese.htm">Edwin Meese</a>, in his former capacity as Attorney General of the United States, and with a group of very distinguished academics, mayors, press people, community activists, and federal officials regarding the issue of the development of the community policing philosophy. The federal government played a very significant role funding that initiative, which literally was the birthplace of what we have come to understand and appreciate as community policing, with all of its manifestations. I want to talk to you today about one of those manifestations: specifically, what has happened within the New York City Police Department and in the city of New York over the last several years regarding crime; what is continuing to happen in that city; and the impact that police strategies have had on the quality of life in the city, and the lessons to be learned from all of this. They are important not only for Washington and for the country, but for countries around the world as well.
<P>
<DD>To understand fully the impact of what has happened in New York in the last few years, we need to take a walk back through time -- to the late 1960s and early 1970s, to the time when I went into the police department in Boston as a young patrolman. To understand the impact of changes in New York City today, we need to have an appreciation of what policing and crime were like in the 1970s and the 1980s, and indeed what they <I>are</I> like as we move through the 1990s. But before I begin that walk back through time, you may be wondering: Where <I>is</I> New York City today with respect to crime? I will give you the end of the story before I tell you the beginning, so that you can appreciate how important the figures I am about to give you are, why so much attention is being paid to the New York City Police Department, and why its successes over the last few years have begun to generate such optimism in this country and around the world. Something <I>can</I> be done about crime.
<P>
<DD><B>"Miracle on 42nd Street."</B> By the end of 1996, recorded incidents in New York City of the seven top crimes measured by the Uniform Crime Reports will be down from their 1990 figures by almost 50 percent -- a 50 percent decline in America's largest city, over a six-year period of time, in the seven major crime categories of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, auto theft, larceny, and burglary. In the city's subway system, which I was privileged to lead from 1990 to 1992, crime has gone down dramatically as well. In 1992, this decline provided me with the opportunity to meet then-mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani, who asked me to explain to him why crime had gone down so dramatically in the subway system and if this could work in the city as a whole. That conversation ultimately led to my appointment, upon his election as Mayor, to the position of Police Commissioner of New York City. Subway crime has continued to decline, and by the end of this year will be down 80 percent from what it was in 1990.
<P>
<DD>These percentages sound great, but what do they mean in terms of the actual number of people who have not been victims of crime this year in New York City?
 <UL>
 <LI><B>Homicides:</B> In 1990, there were 2,246 homicides in New York City, a figure somewhat inflated because of 85 deaths in one fire. Even if you deduct those 85 deaths from the total, this was an historic all-time high for New York City -- 2,246 murders in one city, in one year. Yet by the end of 1996, New York City will report fewer than 1,000 homicides for the year -- a decline of almost 55 percent.
 <P>
 <LI><B>Shooting victims:</B> In 1990, there were 6,000 shooting victims in New York City. By the end of 1996, there will be about 3,000. Shooting victims are a category that police have tended not to track, but one that we track very closely in New York City because of the many things that are done now to save lives, like quicker police response and improved medical services. To understand changes in the incidence of crime, we need to look at the larger issue of crime -- not only at the number of homicide victims, but also at the number of people who may have been homicide victims and were not.
 <P>
 <LI><B>Auto thefts:</B> There were 143,000 auto thefts in New York City in 1990. In 1996, there will be about 65,000.
 <P>
 <LI><B>Robberies:</B> From approximately 85,000 robberies in 1990, it is estimated that the number will fall to the 50,000 range this year.
 <P>
<LI><B>Victims of crimes:</B> Finally, when 1996 comes to a close, there will be approximately 200,000 fewer victims of crime in New York City than there were in 1990.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>
To understand the significance of these figures, we need to understand how New York got to the position it held in 1990, and then look at what began to happen in 1990 and accelerated in 1994 to allow New York to be able to claim now, without fear of contradiction, that it is definitely one of the safest cities in the United States with populations over 100,000 and, among the major cities of the world, one of the safest in the world.
<P>
<B>Rethinking the Methods of Conventional Policing</B>
<P>
<DD>
In 1970, when I joined the Boston Police Department, the country had just begun to emerge from the civil rights era -- an era of race riots and assassinations, if you will. The Kerner Report had come out on what to do about crime in the United States, and American police forces began to enter a new era -- one that has been described as the professional or reform era of policing. This was an era marked by what I describe as the three R's:
 <P>
 <UL>
<LI><B> Reactive policing:</B> In the 1970s, 1980s, and -- unfortunately for many departments in this country -- into the 1990s, policing consisted of something I have come to understand as reactive policing. In the 1970s the intention was to emphasize the ability of police to respond quickly to calls for assistance. The emergency number 911 came into being in the early 1970s and spread rapidly across the country, and police departments began to focus their attention on how quickly they responded to those calls.
 <P>
 <LI><B>Random patrols:</B> The principal means of policing city streets in the 1970s and 1980s became random, not targeted, patrol. When officers were not chasing 911 calls, they were expected to randomly patrol their assigned sector and, by the visibility and randomness of their patrol, deter criminals from committing other crimes.
<P>
<LI><B>Reactive investigation:</B> Lastly, there was a significant effort to improve the professionalism of our detectives to investigate -- but this was reactive investigation.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>What do all of these elements have in common? They are all actions taken after the fact. American police forces began to measure their impact, not on what crime they were preventing, but on how they were responding to crime -- which was a sea change in terms of how the police were policing American cities and why they were invented in the first place. Sir Robert Peel and the Metropolitan Police in London in the early 1800s had officers in uniform -- the British "bobbies" -- patrolling their beats and preventing crime by their presence, by their activity. Somehow, in the 1960s and in the increasingly permissive society of the 1970s, we began to excuse police from having any responsibility for the prevention of crime. We began to espouse that there were so many causes of crime that were beyond the control of police: How could we hold the police accountable for preventing crime when so many of the things that we believed caused crime were beyond their control?
<P>
<DD>Many of these causes have been reported on widely, and they still afflict the city and the country: the breakdown of family values, schools that no longer teach, and an increasingly permissive society that -- using Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's famous explanation in his essay in <I>The Public Interest</I> -- defined social deviancy down. Rather than trying to correct misbehavior or improve standards and norms of behavior, we found it increasingly easier just to excuse it away. We also had a number of societal issues that began having an impact in the 1970s and that now, 25 years later, are having a tremendous impact:
 <UL>
 <LI>The de-institutionalization of patients from mental institutions around the country was intended to put people back into the neighborhoods, and into home-care and local care facilities. But the reality was that the cracks in the floorboards of that plan were so immense that hundreds of thousands fell through them and eventually became the homeless populations in our cities in the 1970s and 1980s.
 <P>
 <LI>An increasing use of drugs during that period culminated in the mid-1980s with the explosion of crack cocaine. It has had a devastating effect.
<P>
<LI>An increasingly permissive society and our tendency to explain away aberrant behavior rather than to try to correct it has compounded the problem of policing our streets -- a problem that many police departments had great difficulty handling in the first place.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>In addition, during the 1970s and 1980s, many police departments in major cities began to shrink in size due to budgetary restraints. In the 1970s, the New York City Police Department laid off thousands of police as the city dealt with its budget crisis. In Boston, as Superintendent of the Boston Police in 1980, I had the unenviable responsibility for laying off 25 percent of the police force, closing half of their police facilities, and reducing the overall size of the department from the 2,800 officers when I joined in 1970 to 1,544 in the summer of 1982. Even as society was increasing the number of things that police were expected to deal with -- not to solve, not to prevent, but to <I>deal</I> with, to respond to -- we saw that we were falling farther and farther behind. By the 1980s, American police by and large were excused from controlling behavior in our streets or changing behavior that was aberrant, to the extent that they were also excused from doing anything about the prevention of crime.
<P>
<DD>I know for a fact, from my experience as a young police officer, as a young sergeant and lieutenant in the Boston Police who was involved in initiating neighborhood policing programs and "team" policing in the Boston area, and ultimately as the Superintendent of the Police, what I was measuring with systems that I designed using the new computers that were coming on board. I was measuring response time -- how quickly could we get cars out to the scene, how quickly could we clear calls? And our policing measures were very impersonal. We took police off the streets of America at just the time when the streets of America were beginning to flood with the worst results of the societal conditions -- conditions caused increasingly by the breakdown in the social values that have been so important in the past. As society was changing, the local police force, the very institution that had been so important in terms of controlling neighborhood streets, was shrinking and removing its officers from those streets.
<P>
<DD>The 1970s and 1980s also saw the popular culture celebrate a kind of "Adam-12" or Jack Webb "Badge 714" type of system. Jack Webb, who played the central role in the popular television series "Dragnet," was viewed as the model of American policing -- very efficient and very stern-faced. That bleeding victim or that very seriously injured rape victim was never offered a word of comfort, never an arm around the shoulder. Police wanted "just the facts, ma'am, just the facts." They had 28 minutes to solve the crime and had to get going. They did not have time to be concerned about prevention. Similarly, on the television series "Adam-12," the two handsome uniformed L.A. cops spent most of their time solving crime by chasing calls. In the 1970s and '80s, this is largely what policing looked like.
<P>
<DD>As a police executive in the late 1970s and early 1980s, I managed these organizations. I speak to you today, in 1996, having been on both sides of the equation: the way we policed in the 1970s and '80s, and the way we began to police in New York City in the 1990s. The policing of the 1990s -- which many would liken to the policing of the 1940s and '50s, with some significant modifications -- is a much better system than the one we used in the 1970s and '80s.
<P>
<DD><B>A City Falling Apart.</B> To appreciate the sea change that has occurred in New York City, we should revisit the New York City of 1990. Like many of you, I had been to New York as a tourist during the 1970s and 1980s, but not with any great frequency. My first visit as a 12-year-old in the 1950s was with my parents. I had a love affair with this great city for many, many years from a distance. In 1990, as Superintendent of Police with the Metropolitan Police in Boston, I was asked by David Gunn, then-president of the Transit Authority (who also ran the Metro system here in Washington, D.C., for a while), to come to New York and see about taking over the position of Transit Police Chief. The transit system was losing hundreds of thousands of riders a year. It is a system that carries 3.5 million riders every day on its subways, and another 1.5 million on its buses; 5 million people a day, 5 million trips a day. But in 1990 it was a system that was ridden with crime and disorder. The impact of societal breakdown was most evident in the city's subway system. I decided to come down to be interviewed.
<P>
<DD>I remember flying into New York City and the gantlet I had to run at LaGuardia Airport. There were all these cab drivers and livery drivers; it was sheer chaos, like in a Third World country, with all of them haranguing, "Take my cab, take my cab!" Finally I found a cab, got in, and off we went. I was now in the hands of somebody I did not know, who did not speak a great deal of English, in a cab that literally did not look like it was going to make it, and we were traveling down roads that were by all accounts incredible -- riddled with potholes, dirty, with graffiti everywhere, and with abandoned cars, litter, and rubber tires all along the highway from LaGuardia heading into Manhattan. "Welcome to New York."
<P>
<DD>And as we entered New York and the island of Manhattan through one of the over 15 ways to get onto the island, we encountered the notorious "squeegee pests," phalanxes of them with five, ten, and 15 at the intersection. One wondered if they were going to take the torch out of the Statute of Liberty's hand and replace it with a squeegee. This could be the official symbol of the city there; it had become that bad. This was everybody's first impression of New York: Whether you were a tourist, a visitor, a person on business, or anybody coming to the city strictly by car, people intimidated you into giving them money for what passed as washing the windshield. This was your "Welcome to New York."
<P>
<DD>I remember going down the "miracle mile," Fifth Avenue. Fifth Avenue is often described as one of the richest shopping areas in the world. Once again, I saw illegal peddlers, beggars, panhandlers, filth, graffiti, and no sign of police. The only police were riding by in police cars that looked as though they were in worse shape than the taxi I was riding in. There just did not seem to be any control, or any pride, or any sense of ownership in the streets of New York.
<P>
<DD>And then I toured the subway. If I thought the streets were bad, the subways were something else. There are 700 entranceways into the city's 450 or so subway stations. Every one of those entranceways seemed like a walk down into Dante's <I>Inferno</I>. They were dirty and grimy. The whole idea of walking below ground can be disheartening to the average person, but especially so when all the turnstiles are disabled. Vandals disabled the turnstiles so that they could stand at the entrance gates with their hands out like the squeegee pests. The only thing they offered you, though, was not to be spit upon or harangued. It was, simply, "Give me your money and I'll let you through this gate."
<P>
<DD>On every platform, there were encampments of homeless people in cardboard cities. In 1990 it was estimated that 5,000 homeless people were living in the subway system in New York City -- a system that killed about 178 of them that year as they fell onto the trains, or were hit by trains, or were murdered in the system. Subways are not for sleeping, and we had to initiate a major campaign to deal with that issue. Then we stepped onto the subway cars, which were remarkably free of graffiti. They were probably the only public entity in New York that was not marked with graffiti because there had been a major campaign in the 1980s to get rid of the graffiti on the cars. But on every car, it seemed, there were aggressive beggars or, once again, homeless people who had taken up residence there. It was not a very encouraging environment.
<P>
<DD>Because I like a challenge, I accepted the job and went to New York in 1990 as Chief of the Transit Police. Crime had been going up 25 percent a year in the three years previous to 1990, and ridership had been falling by the hundreds of thousands. Fare evasion was estimated to run about 200,000 to 250,000 occurrences a day. You could not walk in the station without seeing people leaping over or crawling under the few turnstiles that were still working.
<P>
<DD><B>A Legacy of the 1960s.</B> What you were seeing in the streets and in the subways was the result of 20 years in which cities, in particular, gave up their streets to the criminals and excused police from policing those streets -- phenomenal changes in this country. Disorder had overtaken the quality of life, as witnessed by the so-called signs of crime, as I describe them. These conditions, if left unchecked over time -- and we have conclusively shown this to be true in New York City -- will lead to more significant crime, more significant disorder, and more significant fear. This issue was eloquently addressed in an important article in the <I>Atlantic Monthly</I> in the 1980s, written by James Wilson and George Kelling, scholars who understood the importance of disorder's relationship to crime. In the article, they discussed the "broken windows" syndrome, a term which came out of an experiment conducted in Palo Alto in which the researchers put a car on the street. At first, it was in good shape. Nothing happened to that car. But whenever they broke a window or removed a tire, within a short period of time vandals swarmed around that vehicle and dismantled it.
<P>
<DD>These signs of social disorder include:
<P><UL>
 <LI><B>The first broken window.</B> You and I have seen the old factories where every window pane on their thousands of windows is broken. It started, however, with that first broken window. If you don't correct the problem, you cannot check it.
 <P>
 <LI><B>Graffiti.</B> A remarkable article published in the 1970s -- I saved it for future reference -- in <I>The New York Times</I> celebrated the arrival of graffiti in America as a new form of urban art in which the poor and the indigent could express themselves -- even though it was on everybody else's property and on city walls and parks. In the 1970s we began to celebrate graffiti, but we did not understand what this celebration would cost, projected over time. We were encouraging a form of disorder and a disrespect for other people's property, something that also engendered fear. When gigantic "murals" are covering every conceivable inch of bridge or conduit, people wonder, "What is going on here? Where are the police? Who's in control?" Graffiti lends itself to increasing a sense of social disorder. <P>
 <LI><B>Shocking headlines about crime.</B> Other elements came into play to make New York in 1990 look like a city totally out of control. Two very famous headlines appeared around the time David Dinkins had been elected as Mayor and I came down to New York. In one particular week, 14 or 15 homicides or shootings had occurred. Although they were mostly random in nature, and not against targeted victims, the victims were primarily people who were just walking down the street, even babies in carriages. People who were going about their daily business were shot, killed, and injured in the gunfire on New York City streets as drug dealers fought for turf. It was a continuation of the retreat of policing, of our streets being given up to the criminals; and it provided fertile ground for the crack epidemic of 1985 which quickly took over New York City's streets. In that one terrible week, when it seemed like everything was falling apart, <I>The New York Post</I> proclaimed, in a famous headline, "Do Something Dave!" A month later, <I>Time</I> magazine published a cover story on "New York City, The Rotten Apple" and talked about the same issues I have talked about here today.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>So, in 1990, America's largest city seemed to be falling apart. Crime had been going up, directly fueled by drugs, crack cocaine, and new types of 9mm weaponry in the hands of drug dealers and, unfortunately, increasingly in the hands of younger and younger individuals -- children who had no societal values because none were given to them either in the schools or the homes from which they came. We were losing our streets, and we were losing our homes and our schools as well -- the traditional entities that instruct and shape and guide our young people. By tolerating disorder in the streets, we effectively had given up societal control over our city. In some of our poorest neighborhoods, so much of what had helped to shape and guide and control behavior on the streets had fallen apart. New York City was probably the most vivid example of this breakdown in 1990. Fortunately, Mayor David Dinkins had just hired Lee Brown as his new Police Commissioner. Lee Brown had worked with Ed Meese and others in the development of the community policing philosophy and model. There was a developing recognition by American police chiefs, political leaders, government leaders, and academics that something was terribly wrong, and there were attempts to figure out what could be done -- more specifically, what the police could do -- to contribute to a turnaround. It was quite apparent that the professional reform model of policing was just not cutting it; crime was going up, and disorder in the streets was increasing. The genesis of community policing arose, then, from an idea of what the police should be expected to do. Out of this effort came community policing strategies as they are now practiced throughout the country. Community policing has been embraced by the President, and it has been embraced by America's police leaders as well.
<P>
<B>The Rise of Community Policing in the 1990s</B>
<P>
<DD>I have a simplistic definition of a community policing program: it must have three elements. We talked about the traditional three R's of  rapid response, random patrol, and reactive investigation. And we talked about what a failure policing by this model has been. Community policing from my perspective involves three P's, which should be merged with the three R's. These three elements are:
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI> Partnership;
 <P>
 <LI> Problem solving; and
 <P>
<LI> Prevention.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>
First, community policing involves something that American police lost sight of in the 1970s and 1980s -- partnership. The police are the most effective when they work in partnership with the community and when they are of the community, not apart from it. Police officers are the most effective when they are responding to citizens' needs and working with citizens on determining priorities, as well as when they are working as part of government. For instance, the police can coordinate their efforts with the Parks Department and the Transportation Department regarding the issues of graffiti and cleanup.
<P>
<DD>Partnership should exist as well among the local, state, and federal crime-fighting levels on the coordination of resources. No matter how much money government gave us in the 1970s under the L.E.A.A. [Law Enforcement Assistance Administration] program, no matter how many cops we hired, we were trying to do it on our own. We in law enforcement cannot do it on our own. There are just not enough cops in America for us to do it on our own. So the beauty and strength of community policing is the appreciation and understanding that, with partnership, we can immediately strengthen those 700,000 to 800,000 American police by adding 100 million citizens who are willing to work with the police.
<P>
<DD>And what are they going to work on? Problems. Not 911 calls, the individual incidents, but the problems that generate all those calls, and problems that generate those signs of disorder in our streets. At one point, Lee Brown had advanced an idea that we should look at crime in a medical sense. I responded to this idea when I heard it described this way: Think of malaria; for years and years the response to malaria was to swat at all those mosquitoes. But we are never going to kill all those mosquitoes. What was generating all of those mosquitoes? Swamps. Not until people went in and drained the swamps did they start dealing effectively with the problem. We have developed an inoculation to help, but draining the swamps is something that is still done to this day to control mosquitoes. Problem identification, and going after the problem, is the second P of community policing. Policing must be more focused on the problems that generate crime, whether it is actual crime or the signs of crime -- something we had not been doing well in the 1970s and '80s.
<P>
<DD>Partnership and problem solving are important, but for what purpose? Prevention -- to prevent crime in the first place, and to prevent all those victims. One of the things I feel good about is that during the two and a half years I was Police Commissioner in New York City, by  working within the administration and with those 38,000 cops, we saved over 2,500 lives. And we saved several hundreds of thousands of people from becoming victims of serious crimes. This became such a powerful motivation, such a powerful inspiration, because we saw that we could find ways to prevent crime from occurring in the first place.
<P>
<DD>While community policing has many manifestations, I would argue that any program that does not include these three elements -- partnership, problem solving, and a focus on prevention -- will not enable police to effect change in their communities effectively. Take a look at New York City in 1994. In 1990, David Dinkins hired Lee Brown. Lee Brown brought the concept of community policing to New York City and told David Dinkins that, to put community policing in and to deal with the crime problems that were already here and growing, the city needed to increase the size of its police forces. At that time there were three forces: transit police, housing police, and the city police. In the Transit Authority, I had about 3,600 cops. And there were about 2,600 in the housing police force, who were responsible for the 600,000 people living in the city's 1,000 housing developments.
<P>
<DD>
The city subsequently passed a very significant piece of legislation -- the Safe Street legislation -- as a tax initiative to raise money specifically for hiring 7,000 more police, but also to provide funds for programs that would help prevention, programs within the schools, and something that unfortunately oftentimes has been sloughed off as nonessential, "midnight basketball." In New York City we had beacon schools, and we utilized the school buildings after hours as places for kids to go rather than hanging out on street corners. The Safe Street legislation had quite a bit of money initially for these types of issues; the funds were not to be used exclusively by police, but rather to provide a way to look at the bigger picture -- the prevention picture, if you will.
<P>
<DD>By 1994, when the next mayoral election rolled around, the city had witnessed the addition of several thousand police out of the 7,000 promised (many were in the pipeline), and the community policing philosophy had become an integral part of the NYPD. The department was structured around community policing. But the crime situation did not appear to be getting better. Starting in 1990, crime began to go down, and by the end of 1993, crime had gone down over four years something like 9 percent or 11 percent. But it had been going down in only small, incremental ways. Of the police that were promised, only 2,000 to 3,000 had been hired because it takes time to add 7,000 police officers to a force of 38,000. Consequently, the street conditions had not improved significantly, and people were not feeling that anything had changed.
<P>
<DD><B>Understanding the Quality-of-Life Issues.</B> One of the flaws, if you will, of the community policing initiative of the early 1990s is that a lot of the quality-of-life issues that I believe were causing so much fear remained visibly unchanged, uninterrupted. Quality-of-life issues in New York City are many, since New York is a very large city -- with 8 million people concentrated in 350 square miles, and covered by 76 police precincts. I would argue that no two police precincts in the city have the same set of problems that are of concern to the people that live in them, at least in terms of crime and fear of crime.
<P>
<DD>I live in mid-town Manhattan on Central Park South. Central Park is one of the premier addresses in the world. My front yard is Central Park. In my neighborhood, the issues that generate fear and that are raised at police precinct community council meetings are not about rapes or murders; they are about delivery boys on bicycles riding down the elderly as they make deliveries to buildings. People raise issues about aggressive begging. They also raise the issue about something that is also one of my pet concerns -- and which I can witness from my front window -- and that is public urination in back of the beautiful statue that sits at the front entrance of Central Park, an area that is costing millions to renovate. This statue had become a public urinal. In one of the most beautiful parks in the world, the situation had deteriorated to the extent that nobody was correcting these conditions, conditions that were seen every day by the residents of that neighborhood. It is a neighborhood that has so few murders, so few rapes, and so few burglaries that people were not fearful of these types of crime to which police traditionally respond. Instead, they were fearful of quality-of-life types of transgressions.
<P>
<DD>Meanwhile, in east New York, the 75th precinct had 140 murders in 1990. People there were concerned about shootings, about randomly being shot down on the street, and about the drug dealing that had been allowed to continue uninterrupted, or seemingly uninterrupted, by the police for many years. The quality-of-life issues were different in each of the city's 76 precincts, yet the police were attempting to deal with them throughout the early 1990s as they had done in the 1970s and '80s, with a monolithic police structure.
<P>
<DD><B>The Centralized Bureaucracy.</B> As the New York City Police Commissioner, I was an all-powerful individual. In that organization, everything had to go to the top of the pile to get approval -- even the community policing program. The many thousands of extra police and the well-thought-out programs my predecessors attempted to put into place had created a centralized type of community policing in which the precincts were told exactly how many officers they would have in community policing. Within the precincts, the community police officers were separate from the rest of the precinct officers who were still chasing 911 calls and doing random patrols. The entities were not talking to each other. But each precinct was mandated to have 40 or 50 officers and was told how many officers they could have in plain clothes. It was a centralized bureaucracy that was not capable of responding to the many different needs around the city. It was also, from a management perspective, an entity that had become overspecialized -- and this is an important element in understanding why New York was not doing a good job in many respects at reducing crime. Although it was containing crime, and it was beginning to reduce it, it was not making the wholesale types of reductions that we saw in 1994 and 1995, and that we are seeing now in 1996.
<P>
<DD>The one thing we know about the criminal element is that they work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Those are awful working conditions because they have to work all the time. But New York City's police department, by and large, worked from 9 to 5. Our response units were working 24 hours a day responding to the crimes that occurred, but the gun squad in New York worked Monday to Friday, 9 to 5; the auto theft squad in New York worked Monday to Friday, 10 to 6. In the community policing program, we had authorized thousands of young police officers to make their own hours in response to the neighborhoods' concerns. We gave them flex-time. Interestingly, most of them were still working Monday to Friday, 9 to 5. We were a department that was not where the problems were, so we were not making a great change in crime, and because we were not focused on the quality-of-life issues, we were making no change in what people were seeing everyday. They still saw police walk by all those conditions on the streets.
<P>
<DD><B>Crime and Corruption.</B> I should point out that the factor that drives most of the serious crime in New York City is the use and sale of illegal drugs, though we might argue whether it accounts for 40 percent or 70 percent of the serious crime, because you hear different figures. But New York's real drug problem, which began back in the 1970s, was a problem that most of America's police departments did not experience. It was a problem that compounded New York's difficulty in trying to deal with drugs, particularly when the crack cocaine epidemic exploded in the 1980s. What real problem was this? It was corruption in the police department. In the 1970s, the Knapp Commission reported on its investigations of corruption in the police department. As a result, one of my predecessors, former Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy, was saddled with trying to reduce, remove, or eliminate the systemic corruption that the commission had identified. This corruption reached from the bottom to the top, from the cop on the beat to the police chiefs. It was a systemic corruption that was largely, in today's jargon, somewhat benign in that cops were taking payoffs to look the other way about licensing and premise violations, prostitution, and gaming types of activities -- somewhat minor crimes, if you will, in the overall scheme of things. But this corruption had the same overall effect on the public: The police were not trusted. Police had crossed the line from being protectors to being abusers.
<P>
<DD>In any event, Pat Murphy did a wonderful job in a very short period of time in removing the systemic corruption in that department. But because of this fear of corruption, one way the police in the 1970s and '80s tried to remove the systemic corruption was not authorizing the uniformed police workforce to interact in the drug problems on the street. When the crack cocaine epidemic exploded in 1985, drug dealers were on every street, even on Wall Street; yet the uniformed police in New York City were discouraged from interacting with them. The uniformed cops reported their information to a very heavily supervised Organized Crime Control Bureau, with 2,000 detectives working in squads under sergeants. The problems were so big, however, that this specialized headquarters unit could not possibly solve the drug problem in New York City. Meanwhile, the other 30,000 New York cops were riding on by.
<P>
<DD>In the 1970s and in the 1980s, we were attempting to deal with crime the way we always had, but the nature of the corruption had changed. The corruption now was much worse, much more insidious -- with drug dealers paying off cops not only to look the other way, but at times to protect their shipments. In the 1990s, it had gotten so bad that, by the time of my appointment in 1994, a new anti-corruption commission -- the Mollen Commission -- had issued a report on the widespread corruption in the NYPD. This commission found pockets of corruption -- not systemic corruption throughout the organization, but pockets centered particularly with patrol officers in the city's most crime-ridden, most drug-ridden precincts: the 30th, the 44th, the 48th, the 75th. Wherever you had drugs, you had police corruption in the form of officers who were stealing the drugs and stealing the guns, reselling them, and protecting the drug dealers. Cops themselves had become the criminals. And the organizational structure at this time was such that the department was not policing the problems of the 1990s. They were still policing the problems of the 1970s, and these problems had generated a further pull-back of New York City's police officers from effectively controlling the streets.
<P>
<DD>In 1993, mayoral candidate Giuliani campaigned on three issues: crime, schools, and the economy. The economy lost 400,000 jobs in the previous four years. The schools had ceased to teach 1.1 million school children who, upon graduation, could not take even the most menial jobs in the private-sector economy because they were just not educated. Based on an increasing sense as well that, despite more cops being hired, the crime situation was not getting better, New Yorkers by a very slim margin took David Dinkins out of office and put Rudolph Giuliani in.
<P>
<DD>One of Giuliani's first appointments was to ask me to come back as Commissioner of Police. During the period between 1990 and 1992, while crime had gone down 1 percent to 3 percent in the city as a whole, in the subway system it had gone down 22 percent. We had begun to put in place within the transit system a set of strategies that I would later employ in 1994 as Police Commissioner in New York City. And these strategies were quite simple: They were not only focused on solving the causes of the subway crimes, but they also aggressively attacked those quality-of-life signs of crime. The duality of these two elements, the causes and the signs of crime, was generating fear in New York City, in the subways, and in the streets.
<P>
<DD><B>Making Subways Safer.</B> In the subway system, we began by aggressively arresting the fare evaders and ejecting disorderly people from the subway. I had more tools to work with than the city police, so we began strategically to go after what little crime there actually was in the subway system. For a system serving 5 million riders a day with bus and subway passengers, there were only about 60 to 70 reported crimes a day. The chances of being a victim of a crime in the subway system were statistically like the chances of winning the lottery. But what people saw every day -- the disorder, the fare evaders, and police who were not doing anything about it -- reinforced their fears and, rather than subjecting themselves to the cause of this fear, people were beginning to stay away.
<P>
<DD>We began to turn this around for the first time in years by having our officers enforce quality-of-life rules in the subway system. And what did we find? We found that one out of every seven people that we arrested for fare evasion was wanted on a warrant, and one out of every 21 was carrying some type of weapon. Crime in the subways was crime of opportunity, committed by people who were not paying the fares but who were carrying a weapon and were wanted on warrants. Chances were good that they were not coming into the subway just to commute back and forth to work: They were at work, and you and I were the people they were looking to work on. By arresting them as they came in, and by doing it on a large scale and putting police out in so many different ways, we began to change behaviors. We began to control behavior in the subway system.
<P>
<DD>We began to change the environment so much that, in 1996, the number of estimated fare evaders on any given day in New York City's subway system is between 30,000 and 40,000, which is down from the 200,000 to 250,000 occurrences in 1990. We changed that behavior. How do I know that we changed it? By looking at the statistics of fare evaders who were arrested this year: Only about one in 100 are wanted on a warrant, and one in many hundreds are actually carrying a weapon. People did not voluntarily start paying the fares and stop carrying their weapons into the system; they did these things because they knew the police were there and the police were going to act on any type of misbehavior.
<P>
<DD><B>Making the Streets Safer.</B> When Mayor Giuliani interviewed me for the position of Commissioner of Police, he asked: What could you do in the streets? Could you do the same thing you did in the subways? I told him I believed we could, but it was going to take several things. First, it would require his political will, as Mayor, to focus on the issues of primary concern -- the economy, crime, and the schools -- and second, to coordinate all the activities of the agencies of government. On the crime issue, this meant that the Parks Department and the Transportation Department would work with other city agencies on the quality-of-life issues that were generating fear. They would aggressively go after graffiti and littering; they would aggressively go after public drinking and all the other things that generated fear. While the police are enforcing these laws, the rest of city government would be involved in remedying and removing the visible signs. If graffiti was put up on a wall, it would be taken off very quickly. By implementing this partnership to address the signs of crime as well as the crime itself, we began to reduce the fear.
<P>
<DD><B>Decentralizing the Bureaucracy.</B> In the New York City Police Department, we did several things. First, I decentralized. I gave away many of my powers not -- as my predecessors wanted -- to the cop on the beat, but rather to the precinct commander. I did not want to give more power to the cops on the beat. They were, on the average, only 22 years of age. Most of them never held a job before becoming New York City police officers, and had only high school or GED qualification. These kids, after six months of training, were not prepared to solve the problems of New York City; sorry, but it just was not going to work that way. However, my precinct commanders typically had an average of 15 years of service, and they were some of the best and the brightest on the police force. All of them were college educated; all were very sophisticated; and they were at the appropriate level in the organization to which power should be decentralized.
<P>
<DD><B>Establishing Managerial Accountability.</B> My form of community policing, therefore, versus former Police Commissioners Lee Brown's and Ray Kelly's, put less emphasis on the cop on the beat and much more emphasis on the precinct commanders, the same precinct commanders who met with community councils and with neighborhood groups. They were empowered to decide how many plain clothes officers to assign, how many to put in community policing, on bicycle patrols, and in robbery squads. They were empowered to assign officers as they saw fit -- in uniform or in plain clothes -- to focus on the priorities of that neighborhood. If it was a 75th precinct, they would focus on the shootings and the drug dealings. If the problem was the bicycle messengers on the sidewalks of Manhattan, they would go after that. Whatever was generating the fear in their precinct, they were empowered to address it by prioritizing their responses. We decentralized the organization, and I eliminated a few levels in the organization of the force and in the hierarchy as well.
<P>
<DD>Second, we put into place a system called COMPSTAT (for computer statistics) to manage our 38,000 police officers and a 44,000-person organization. When I began running the NYPD in 1994, the crime statistics were gathered only twice a year for the sole purpose of submitting the statistics to the FBI for their semiannual and annual reports. The NYPD did not use crime statistics to manage the routine assignment of resources. At first, they told us we could not get crime stats on a daily or weekly basis -- there were just too many of them. Finally, with a lot of prodding, pushing, kicking, and replacement of personnel and the naysayers, we developed a system so that I could get crime statistics every day and, more important, every week to share with the rest of the department. It was timely, accurate intelligence. Imagine trying to run a business without timely, accurate information on where your customers are and where your markets are; it is not an efficient or profitable way to operate.
<P>
<DD><B>Using the Private-Sector Model.</B> We began to run the NYPD as a private profit-oriented business. What was the profit I wanted? Crime reduction. I wanted to beat my competitors -- the criminals -- who were out there working seven days a week, 24 hours a day. I wanted to serve my customers, the public, better; and the profit I wanted to deliver to them was reduced crime. All of my franchises -- my 76 precincts -- were measured, not on how many calls they responded to, but on how much crime was reduced. And every one of the 76 precincts in New York City saw a double-digit decline in crime, so the results were not just happening in the war-torn neighborhoods. Crime reductions were happening throughout the city by our empowering the precincts to act. We were running the police department as a business, and we developed the COMPSTAT process to facilitate it.
<P>
<DD>The city of New York is divided into eight geographical areas, or boroughs. We call them patrol boroughs, and each one has 8 to 10 precincts. Once a month from 7:00 to 10:00 in the morning, we would have a borough come down with its precinct commanders and detective squad commanders to meet with all the headquarters specialized units, all the super chiefs in the departments, myself as Police Commissioner, probation, parole, and District Attorney representatives, crime analysis representatives, and representatives from each of the other seven boroughs. For three hours we would work on the issue of crime in that borough: Why is it up? Why is it down? What's happening? We utilized computerized statistics. Using very large computerized pin maps to show where the crime is occurring, we would ask ourselves: What are we doing about it? Where are we making arrests? Where are the parolees living? Large amounts of information were reduced to the simplest form by such computer analysis.
<P>
<DD><B>Sharing Information.</B> Another major element of what we did in this new process at NYPD was inclusion, not exclusion. The NYPD had been run as an exclusive organization; it would exclude people from information. We approached it from the other direction -- inclusion: Give everybody as much information as they need and want. The sharing went on in that room from 7:00 to 10:00 in the morning; everybody was sharing information. If an issue was raised, such as why someone could not make an arrest, and the answer came out that it was because the District Attorney would not give them the complaints, I could confront the District Attorney's representatives who were right there. Instead of spending three or four days trying to track the D.A. down, I could get answers directly from someone right there in the room. And if that representative did not have the answer, then I would call the D.A.  Intimacy, the sharing of information in as wide a range as possible, inclusion, and COMPSTAT were important to this process.
<P>
<DD>It is my belief that the COMPSTAT process can be utilized effectively by any police department, in this country and abroad. The COMPSTAT process is made up of four very simple elements:

 <P>
 <UL>
<LI><B>Timely, accurate intelligence.</B> What good is crime statistics information for preventing crime when it is gathered only twice a year?
 <P>
 <LI><B>Rapid response.</B> Using the COMPSTAT process, we could identify a trend developing with only two or three incidences, instead of waiting for 40 or 50 over six months. Sharing this information so that everybody is aware of a problem and works together on providing resources very quickly to address that problem allows us to rapidly respond to where the crime is happening -- using plain clothes, uniforms, specialized units, or whatever is required.
 <P>
 <LI><B>Effective tactics.</B> We were able to ask ourselves: What works? The answer could be plain clothes, uniforms, or coordinated activity with the Feds or the D.A.
 <P>
<LI><B>Relentless follow-up.</B> People in that meeting knew they were coming back the next month, and that next month we were going to talk about the same issues that were raised this month. The issues don't go away. We weren't discussing something that happened one time and then could be put on the shelf. In the COMPSTAT process, everyone knew they were coming back to explain why crime is up or why it is down. Over the last two years, every precinct commander in the police department has been replaced. Many of them have been promoted up because they were doing such a good job, but many others were moved out because they were not doing a good job. They were not moved out because they were not reducing crime. They were moved out because they didn't understand the problems in their community and they were not responding to these problems effectively; after several tries, if they still were not responding, they were replaced.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>
Timely, accurate intelligence is a very important element in this process. Let me give you an analogy. In World War II, Germany was getting ready to invade the British Isles. They had forced the British to flee Dunkirk. The British had only 450 Spitfires scattered around all of England to protect its cities. The Germans had thousands of bombers that they were flying over English cities every day. However, the British had one thing that the Germans didn't have: They had radar. As German bombers began coming out of bases in Europe and headed toward Britain, the radar allowed the British to vector where those bombers were heading while they were still over the English Channel. Using that information, the British were able to mobilize the 450 Spitfires and vector them right onto the German bombers. Timely, accurate information, rapid response, effective tactics. Despite very few resources, they knew where the enemy was. That's what won the Battle of Britain.
<P>
<DD>
<B>Getting Results.</B> Similarly, in New York City, we now know where the enemy is, up to the minute; we know where the problems are, and we go after them. That COMPSTAT meeting room is a high-pressure environment, with 200 to 250 police officials and others looking at crime. It is show time. In one of our meetings, Jack Maple, my principal crime strategist, asked the commander of one of the east New York precincts to put on the map all of the drug complaints in that precinct; and up they went. The whole map was covered with complaints, but there were clusters, the hot spots. Then he asked the commander to mark where his drug units were making arrests last month. Those went up right off the bat. Interestingly, the complaints were on one side of the map; the drug arrests were on the other side. You would think they would overlap each other. This process graphically showed what was going on under the old system, where police were rated "effective" by the number of arrests they were making, not by the problems they were solving. They were rated on the incidents they responded to, not on the problems they were solving.
<P>
<DD>When we asked the drug unit commander why his officers were making arrests on that side of the precinct and not over where the complaints were, he responded that the complaints were coming from the public housing developments. When asked why they were not making arrests there if the drug complaints came from there, he responded that it was hard to make arrests there. Can you imagine what it is like to live there if the police will not even go there to make arrests? That was the mentality running the NYPD, and I guarantee it is still running many major police departments. Cops are still being measured on their arrests, not on their solutions to problems.
<P>
<DD>In New York, the major turnaround came because we began to focus -- unlike professional reform policing of the 1970s and 1980s -- on the three P's of partnership, problem solving, and prevention. I would also argue that the principal reason (and there are many) that crime is down in New York City is that there is the political will to utilize the police in different ways. But it is also due to the strategies we are employing, with the focus on problem solving rather than incidence response. Specifically, we are getting better at understanding the importance of the quality of life, of changing behavior at the street level and controlling behavior, and thus preventing crime farther down the line.
<P>
<DD>We have seen time and time again that when those 38,000 cops interrupt somebody drinking on the street, or a gang of kids drinking on a corner, pat them down, and find a gun or a knife, they have prevented what would have happened two or three hours later when someone who was drunk pulled out the gun or knife. Usually this would have ended with another murder victim, but we prevented the crime before it happened. New York City police are now all about prevention, and we are doing it lawfully.
<P>
<DD>This is not to say that there have not been any circumstances -- and I will be very truthful about this -- causing complaints against police officers in New York City. But when I match the 9,000 or so complaints against the 38,000 cops who are making 300,000 arrests and issuing several million summonses, and against the millions upon millions of street encounters by police who are encouraged to get out there and take back the streets, I think that 9,000 complaints is a fair exchange -- if in fact the police are being supervised, if they are being trained, and if they are being encouraged to do all that they do with one underlying principle, the issue of respect. Police have to do their work in such a way that they do not lose the respect of their communities. In a very celebrated case recently in New York City, a police officer did not treat residents with respect. That one incident has reversed so much of the good hard work of the police in that neighborhood because, once again, the police are not being trusted, and it is all due to the action, the aberrant behavior, of a single officer. One incident like that can be used against any other police officer in New York City. All your good work can get washed away when you do not police communities with respect.
<P>
<DD>We have come a long way in New York City. We have come a long way in this country as well. Many communities are now embracing community policing. The Heritage Foundation has also come out with <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1089b.html">21 recommendations</a>.<sup>1</sup> A lot of people are coming up with ideas, and the good news is that many of those ideas are good. In New York City, an old adage says that "If you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere." This applies to community policing. What arguably was once America's most dangerous, most crime-ridden city is now being pointed to -- and rightfully so -- as one of America's safest cities. If we can make it happen in New York City, with many of the difficulties we faced in New York, then I would argue that hope and optimism should be out there for everybody else.
<P>
<DD>I believe that as a profession we found better ways of policing in New York City, and a lot of our success lies under the umbrella of community policing and the philosophy it espouses. You and I -- you as the public and I in my former capacity as a member of the police force -- can work together to deal with the problems that you and I identify. And we will work from the basic premise that it is much better to prevent a crime than to solve it after the fact.

	ACU: RE-ELECT GINGRICH 
</h3></center>
<a href="/conservative/press/keene010697.html">Statement by David A. Keene</a>
<br><a href="/conservative/press/res010697.html">ACU Board Resolution</a>
<p>

<blockquote>

WASHINGTON, DC.--- "Two major factors have led us to the unprecedented position we announce today on the re-election of Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the American Conservative Union (ACU). "Regardless of any minor differences we have had with the Speaker in the past, there is no question that under his leadership, the national debate is now being conducted in conservative political terms. From our perspective as the leading grassroots conservative ideological organization, this is vital. To defeat Gingrich is to effectively cede control of the House to the liberals who oppose him. 
<P>
"The second relates to the hypocrisy of Gingrich's liberal Democrat critics. They have transformed the struggle from a routine partisan difference into an ideological battle. They oppose him not just because he is a Republican, but because he has helped reinvigorate the Republican Party and brought conservative initiatives to the forefront of the nation's political agenda. These same liberal leaders have had little or nothing to say about illegal and unethical shenanigans within the Clinton Administration, the Democratic National Committee, and the House Democratic leadership itself."
<P>
ACU's 33-member Board of Directors has endorsed a <a href="/conservative/press/res010697.html">resolution</a> supporting Gingrich's re-election as 
Speaker, observing that "conservative Congressional leadership is required to promote and advance conservative legislative initiatives the American people support in the 105th Congress and beyond" and that Gingrich's critics are attempting to force him from office "for purely partisan political reasons while ignoring extremely serious ethical lapses plaguing the Clinton Administration, the House Democratic leadership, and the Democratic National Committee." It marks the first time that the organization has taken a formal position on a Congressional leadership election.
<P>
"By supporting Newt Gingrich for re-election as Speaker, ACU is not condoning or excusing unethical conduct," Keene said. "If the Speaker has acted contrary to House rules, then he should be held to account just like any other member. What concerns us is that the ethics charges have been exploited by his critics not simply to bring him down personally, but to derail the conservative agenda in Congress.

<P>
<DD>As the United States prepares to enter the 21st century, its educational system is in crisis. Despite the more than $175 billion in program dollars that have been spent by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) over the past 16 years on elementary and secondary education, achievement scores continue to stagnate as increasing proportions of America's youth drop out of school.<sup>1</sup>  Most of America's students are not meeting proficient levels in reading, and, in 1994, 57 percent of high school seniors lacked even a basic knowledge of U.S. history.<sup>2</sup>  In addition, impoverished children in inner-city and rural areas often lack access to schools that adequately equip them to escape the cycle of poverty and dependency. In some of these school districts there are twice as many school-related crime incidents as there are graduating seniors.<sup>3</sup>  Such statistics strongly suggest the need for Congress to require a closer evaluation of where the ED's dollars go and whether they have any measured impact on educational achievement.
<P>
<DD>
In order to determine where the ED allocates elementary and secondary education dollars and their effects, ideally we would want to know how much of every elementary and secondary education program dollar reaches classrooms in local schools and what effect each program dollar has on achievement. In addition, to determine the full value of ED elementary and secondary education spending, we also would want to determine what states must spend of their own money to receive federal dollars and comply with its regulations and requirements. Comprehensive data such as these, however, do not currently exist.
<P>
<DD>
Based on data available at this time, we can calculate what portion of each tax dollar that funds ED elementary and secondary education programs reaches school districts. According to The Heritage Foundation Education Finance Model, which tracks the ED funds reaching local school districts using data from the ED and other federal agencies,<sup>4</sup> our initial examination of the ED's spending on elementary and secondary education found that 85 cents of each dollar the ED allocates for elementary and secondary programs is sent to school districts. To put it another way, based on 1993 data, of the more than $14 billion allocated to the ED elementary and secondary education programs included in our analysis, $2 billion was allocated to entities other than local school districts.<sup>5</sup>  This money was used to pay for administrative overhead, as well as state and national programs of unknown effectiveness. 
<P>
<DD>
At the national level, there has been considerable debate about the proper role of the federal government in education and, more specifically, the need for the ED itself. The continuing poor educational performance of America's schoolchildren suggests a need to reexamine the role of the U.S. Department of Education in funding elementary and secondary education. This paper is the first in a series that will look at the federal role in education: It examines where the ED's elementary and secondary education dollars go, and what steps Congress needs to take in order for each state to evaluate what it is getting from the funds received from the ED.
<P>

<B>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SPENDING ON ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION</B>
<P>
<DD>
The vast majority of all federal education funds does not go to schools or school districts. In 1995, 33 percent of the total $100 billion the federal government allocated for education was spent by the ED; less than half of all ED funds went to elementary and secondary education (see see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/education/fyi126c1.gif">Chart 1</a>); and less than 40 percent of ED funds went to local educational agencies, 13.1 percent of total federal education spending.<sup>6</sup>  Contrary to what many Americans believe, the ED actually funds very few elementary and secondary education programs in their local communities.
<P>
<DD>
In fact, ED spending amounts to only about 4.5 percent of all the money, including state and local revenues, spent for elementary and secondary education. Yet it has a significant influence on state and local education agencies and on schools all across the country.<sup>7</sup>  These programs fundamentally shape how states and local school districts allocate their resources to meet the unique educational needs of their student populations. In order to receive federal money, state and local educational agencies must spend their own state and local tax dollars to apply for funds and to comply with the regulations that often dictate not just how the federal money is spent, but also how state and local money must be spent.<sup>8</sup>  Therefore, it is all the more important to understand where ED elementary and secondary education dollars go and how they affect academic achievement.
<P>
<DD>
The majority of the funds appropriated for elementary and secondary education programs is dedicated to addressing the needs of disadvantaged and disabled students through Chapter 1/Title I and Education for Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) programs. In FY 1993 (the year for which this analysis was performed), about 70 percent of the ED's $14 billion in elementary and secondary appropriations funded such programs. 
<P>
<DD>
In addition to programs addressing the needs of special populations, Congress has appropriated funds for various programs in which there is a perceived need or federal role, such as Safe and Drug Free Schools and Bilingual Education. This paper's <a href="#app1">Appendix 1</a> lists the ED elementary and secondary programs that primarily send their money to local school districts, either directly or via state educational agencies. There is a wide range in the amounts of total program funding that reach local school districts. 
<P>
<DD>
What portion of all ED spending on elementary and secondary education actually goes to local school districts for their direct use?  Based on The Heritage Foundation's Education Finance Model using 1993 tax and budget data, about 15 cents of every tax dollar sent to Washington, D.C., for ED elementary and secondary education programs -- more than $2 billion -- is spent on state and national programs and administration.<sup>9</sup>  This spending breaks down as follows:
<p>

</table>
</center>
<P>
<DD>The ED, like all other federal Cabinet agencies, is funded with revenues appropriated by Congress and composed primarily of individual and corporate tax revenues. Based on the proportion of all individual taxes sent to the federal government from each state and what that state receives as a proportion of ED elementary and secondary education spending, we are able to calculate each state's net "return."  Because the majority of the funds local school districts receive from the ED is allocated to address the needs of students who are disadvantaged or have special needs, certain states receive a greater return per tax dollar than others. According to our analysis, school districts in Connecticut, for example, receive only 39 cents in return for every dollar sent to Washington for elementary and secondary education programs operated by the ED (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/education/fyi126t1.gif">Table 1</a>). School districts in Alaska, on the other hand, have relatively smaller school populations and receive additional funds from Impact Aid and Indian Education; consequently, they receive more than $3 for every tax dollar sent to Washington for ED's elementary and secondary education programs. 
<P>
<DD>
But, as the Heritage model shows, not all of the individual and corporate tax revenue that goes to Washington goes back to local school districts. More than $2 billion is spent on state and national programs and administration. How is that extra money being spent?
<P>

<B>Department of Education Elementary and Secondary Spending on Administration and National and Federally Funded State Programs</b>
<P>
<DD>
Slightly more than $2 billion -- 15 cents of every tax dollar appropriated by Congress to fund the ED's elementary and secondary education programs -- is being spent by the ED, state governments, universities, libraries, and private organizations on administration, national programs, and federally funded state programs.
<p>
<B>National Programs</B>
<P>
<DD>
The ED funds many national programs and activities that are administered directly by the ED and designed to effect change at the national or regional level rather than just at the local level.<sup>10</sup>  Many programs that send funds to the states to be distributed to local school districts have national components that are operated at the federal level. The Safe and Drug Free Schools program, for example, sends funds to the states in its State Grants program, but it also has a "National Programs" component that is operated at the federal level. The recipients of funds from these programs are primarily universities and private organizations. A few programs award competitive grants to individual schools and school districts<sup>11</sup> (see <a href="#app2">Appendix 2</a>).
<P>
<DD>
<B>Lack of Evaluation.</B> Most of these national programs have not been subject to the level of critical evaluation or oversight that one normally would expect, such as a review by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), the financial investigative arm of Congress. Evaluating national programs often is difficult and subjective, and these evaluations frequently are not conducted because funds are not going directly toward increasing student achievement. In these cases, the sole remaining determination is whether the program is run efficiently; even these kinds of data, however, rarely are collected.
<P>
<DD>
Several of the evaluations that do exist indicate the funds are not being used effectively. Some examples:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> An audit of Women's Educational Equity (WEEA), a program designed to promote equity in education for women that specifically targets elementary and secondary students, was described by the GAO as a "program with no director, with a staff of one and one-quarter persons in two different offices of the Department... with too many resources [going] for direct services to small numbers of persons."<sup>12</sup>  Only 17 percent of WEEA awards go to state and local school districts, and the GAO found little evidence that the other recipients were working with state or local education agencies to address equity problems in public schools.<sup>13</sup>  According to the GAO, there is "little evidence of their effectiveness in eliminating sex bias in education."<sup>14</sup>
<P>
<LI> A study of the Ellender Fellowships program found that, although federal and private funding for the program had increased significantly, the number of fellowships had declined steadily. The study also found that more teachers and administrators had received funds than students.<sup>15</sup>
<P>
<LI> The Media and Captioning Services, funded under the Individuals with Disabilities Act, spends $19 million to close-caption television shows, targeting those that enrich the "general, educational and cultural experiences and advancement of individuals with hearing impairment."<sup>16</sup>  In the second half of the 104th Congress, the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee discovered that, according to the ED, such programs as "Baywatch," "Regis and Kathie Lee," and "The Young and the Restless" fit this category and are included in the close-captioning project.<sup>17</sup> 
</UL>
<P>
<B>State Programs</B>
<P>
<DD>
Under such programs as Eisenhower Math and Science and Title I, as well as others among those listed in the Appendix, states have the option of keeping funds for state programs and activities. In addition, the ED often allows -- and often requires -- state governments to allocate elementary and secondary appropriations to universities, libraries, and private organizations. More than 5 cents of every education tax dollar sent to the states is allocated by state governments to recipients other than local education agencies. The types of programs funded with these allocations range from university research in the area of elementary and secondary drug curriculum to awards for private organizations for the purpose of operating community activities.

<P>
<B>Administrative Costs</B>
<P>
<DD>
The ED uses approximately $130 million just for administering elementary and secondary education programs, which includes salaries, expenses, and departmental management. Because the ED currently does not track administrative expenditures by program, it is difficult to determine whether a program is being operated efficiently. Calculating an "overhead" percentage per program would enable Congress to determine whether a program is being operated in an efficient manner, or even if it is possible to administer certain types of programs at the federal level in a cost-effective manner.
<P>
<DD>
The ED also permits states to keep a certain percentage of their federal program dollars in order to administer and operate these programs.<sup>18</sup>  About 5 cents of every tax dollar spent by the ED on elementary and secondary education goes toward this purpose. For example, states are permitted to keep 1 percent of funds they receive for Chapter 1/Title I for administrative expenses. 
<P>
<DD>
According to the GAO, the states fund a significant portion of their state education agencies with federal funds.<sup>19</sup>  In FY 1993, for example, federal funds constituted about 41 percent of all state education operating funds, and 41 percent of the staff were federally funded.<sup>20</sup>  For all education programs, the states keep 5.8 percent of all federal funds they receive in order to administer and operate federal programs, about four times greater than the percentage of state funds retained for the same purpose. According to the GAO study, state officials found that federal education programs had more significant administrative and regulatory requirements than state programs, and that these requirements contributed to higher administrative costs, as evidenced by the higher proportion of funds retained for federal programs.<sup>21</sup>
<p>
<B>What Actually Makes It to the Schools and Classrooms?</B>
<P>
<DD>
The Heritage Foundation Education Finance Model tracks only what portion of ED elementary and secondary education dollars reaches school districts: districts, however, are still several layers of bureaucracy away from classrooms. School districts are not required at this time to track what portion of their ED dollars is sent directly to schools and classrooms. And few districts -- and virtually no parents and taxpayers -- have any accurate data with which to figure out how many cents on the dollar reach the classroom.<sup>22</sup>
<P>
<DD>
There are studies, however, that indicate just how little in general gets from school districts to the classroom. Audits around the country have found as little as 26 percent of school district funds is being spent on classroom expenditures.<sup>23</sup>  But Coopers & Lybrand, an accounting firm, has designed a new financial model to analyze what portion of school district education money actually reaches schools and classrooms. This model was released recently after it was field tested in 118 school districts and 17 states, and is now being implemented statewide in South Carolina and Rhode Island. The Coopers & Lybrand model is not designed to address the issue of specifically tracking ED funds, but results from the districts in which the model has been tested give an overall idea of the portion of each federal tax dollar that is returned to schools and classrooms. For example, New York City Public School System Chancellor Rudy Crew recently released an analysis that was built on a 1994 Coopers & Lybrand analysis of the city's public school system. The report found that only 43 percent of the district's total funds were spent on direct classroom expenditures.<sup>24</sup>  
<P>
<DD>
If the New York City Public School System provides any indication of what portion of federal dollars reaches the classroom nationwide, then there is an even more serious need to determine what schools are receiving in fact from ED elementary and secondary education funds, and how they are benefiting.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
<DD>
The U.S. Department of Education currently spends over $2 billion of individual and corporate tax dollars on programs and administrative costs that do not directly involve local school districts. Some states see a return on this investment; others do not, however, and, in some cases, the loss may be significant. Because of stagnant achievement results over the past 15 years, and the range and amount of funds states receive in return for their investment in the ED's programs, state and local communities and Congress have a right to know what they are getting for their money. 
<P>
<DD>
In order for Congress and state and local school districts to evaluate properly what they are receiving from the ED, Congress should:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B> Take steps to evaluate the effectiveness of national and state programs that do not allocate funds primarily to local school districts or schools.</B> Programs that do send funds primarily to schools should also undergo evaluation, of course. If such programs do not benefit students, money should be sent back to state and local communities to be used as they deem necessary to meet the unique needs of their student populations.
<P>
<LI><B>Require the ED to track their administrative costs by program,</B> so that policymakers can determine whether a program is being operated efficiently and can keep administrative costs to a minimum. 
<P>
<LI><B>Encourage states that receive ED funds to track expenditures of federal and state revenues for the administration of federal programs.</B> State education agencies have little or no specific information at this time on the proportion of federal and state revenues they expend to administer federal programs.
<P>
<LI><B>Encourage states and local school districts to employ the use of financial models</B> that would allow them to account for how scarce educational resources are being spent.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>
Before there can be any serious debate as to whether states and local communities benefit from the tax dollars they send to Washington for elementary and secondary education as funded by the Department of Education, more information is needed about how the money is being spent and whether the programs benefit the educational well-being of children.

<P>
<B>Design of Model</B>
<P>
<DD>
In order to determine what portion of Department of Education elementary and secondary education dollars reaches local school districts, the following questions needed to be answered:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>How much money does each state receive for elementary and secondary education programs from the U.S. Department of Education (ED)?</B>
<P>
The amount of money received by the states is collected by the National Center for Education Statistics. We used their file, entitled "The Distribution of StateAdministered Federal Education Funds in FY 1993," as well as data from the Departments of Education and Commerce and the General Accounting Office (GAO).
<P>
<LI>
<B>How much does each state contribute in individual tax revenues to fund the ED? </B>
<P>

IRS statistics of income data for tax year 1993 provide data on what each state sent to Washington in individual taxes. By multiplying total individual tax revenue by the percentage of general revenues composed of ED elementary and secondary program dollars, we were able to calculate the portion of tax revenues funding those programs. 
<P>
<LI>
<B>What is the net return to each state for every individual tax dollar sent to the ED to fund elementary and secondary programs? </B>
<P>

This calculation is based on the proportion of general revenues used to fund ED elementary and secondary education programs, adjusting that percentage to include only revenues from individual tax dollars. We subtracted what each state received from the ED in elementary and secondary appropriations from their proportionate "share" of elementary and secondary funds based on their relative share of individual taxes.
</UL>
<P>
<B>
Data Adjustments and Assumptions</B>
<P>

<DD>Most of the education programs included in this analysis are "forward funded."  Thus, FY 1993 appropriations correspond roughly to the 19931994 school year. Although the 1993 tax year does not correspond exactly, we concluded that any difference would be negligible.
<P>

<DD>
Wherever possible, we included outlays, not obligations, in our calculations. 

<P>
<B>Tax Data</B>
<P>

<DD>We adjusted the state-by-state individual tax data downward in order to match aggregate data from the Office of Management and Budget on the portion of general revenue composed of individual taxes. This was necessary because the state breakdown of individual tax revenues is estimated by the Internal Revenue Service using a sample of the tax returns from each state.
<P>
<DD>
Because of the difficulties associated with breaking down corporate tax revenues by state, we examined only individual taxes to determine what portion of each tax dollar is received by local school districts. Seventy percent of the U.S. government's general revenues is composed of individual tax dollars. We adjusted the total amount of individual tax dollars spent at the department and state level accordingly, assuming a constant rate of loss per corporate tax dollar as well as for individual tax dollars in order to come up with the total $2 billion in taxes spent. Thus, the sum of what each state nets from the ED does not amount to $2 billion, because the state totals reflect only individual taxes.
<P>
<B>Education Data</B>
<P>
<DD>
In order to control most efficiently for differences in state reporting of funds received from the ED, for the purposes of this model we assumed that states disbursed 100 percent of the funds received from the ED during the fiscal year in question. Consequently, we distributed among the types of recipients the difference between the total allocations reported by each state and what each state actually was appropriated.
<P>
<DD>
When a state receives funding from the ED, it either retains it for use by state agencies or allocates it to five other types of recipients: state institutions, local education agencies, universities, libraries, or some other entity or organization. We distributed the difference between appropriated funds and reported funds among these categories based on reported allocations and data from the GAO on the percentage of federal funds retained by states in order to distribute them as accurately as possible.<sup>25</sup>
<P>
<DD>
For this analysis, we combined recipient categories in order to minimize allocation discrepancies. The categories we used for analysis were: state agencies, local school districts, and "other."
<P>
<DD>
We also adjusted budget data so that they reflected only the funds going to the 50 states, excluding the territories and Puerto Rico.

<P>
<B>Why 15 cents per tax dollar is a conservative estimate:</B>
<P>
<DD>
Most states do not allocate these funds within one year, and thus there is a certain amount of what is known as "carryover."  In reality, local school districts actually receive less than our calculation of 85 cents per tax dollar during a calendar year. According to ED calculations based on state-reported data (not appropriations), for every dollar sent to the states for local school districts, less than 85 cents makes it to school districts. Combined with the 5 cents spent at the federal level, this amounts to only about 80 cents returning to school districts. 
<P>
<B>Data Limitations </B>
<P>
<DD>
Education data used in this model are based on state-reported data, with some improvements and corrections made by the ED's National Center for Education Statistics. As previously mentioned, many states reported only low percentages of total funds appropriated; thus, the data required adjustment to be comparable. There also are inherent limitations on data of a "self-reported" nature.
<P>
<DD>
Data used in this analysis represent more than 94 percent ($13.2 billion) of the ED's $14 billion FY 1993 elementary and secondary education budget. Certain smaller programs were left out because of inadequate or non-existent state-level and sub-allocation data. In addition, although the ED collects data on the Foreign Language Assistance Centers program, it was excluded from this analysis because the percentage reported by the states of total funds appropriated was less than 70 percent, with some states reporting less than 5 percent. Our conclusion that 15 cents per tax dollar allocated to ED elementary and secondary programs amounts to $2 billion is reflective only of the budget included in our analysis. Consequently, it is possible that the figure understates the total amount by about 6 percent.
<P>
<DD>
Using budget and ED data, we are able to determine where most of the money was spent, but gaps remain to the extent that it is not possible to itemize each expenditure at the federal and state level that figures in to the 15 cents per tax dollar spent at the state and departmental level.

<LI>      The submission of such applications requires the use of state and local revenue, with no guarantee of what they will receive based on federal/state funding formulas or grant awards. Many federal forms for optional programs require special expertise to complete properly, discouraging smaller and poorer school districts from applying unless they can afford to hire a trained grant-writer. A study completed a few years ago by the state of Ohio found 170 forms totaling over 700 pages that could be attributed to participation in federal programs, with over 40 percent of them classified as "mandatory" or "virtually mandatory." Over one-half of the forms identified in their study of public-school reporting requirements were attributable to federal programs, although when the study was conducted Ohio was receiving only 5 percent of its education revenues from the federal government.

<H3>A Strange New Regime: 
The Naked Public Square and the Passing of the American Constitutional Order</H3>

By Richard John Neuhaus<br>
A Salvatori Lecture at The Heritage Foundation<br>
Delivered October 8, 1996
<P>
<DD>
The phrase "one nation under God" was only added to the Pledge of Allegiance in 1954. Observers have frequently noted that it appeared at an unseemly time and for dubious reasons -- during the allegedly paranoid national hysteria called McCarthyism. There is an element of truth in that way of telling the story. But I expect there is a much greater significance to the phrase "one nation under God."  Politics is in largest part a function of culture, and at the heart of culture is morality, and at the heart of morality is religion. The word "culture," we need always to be reminded, is derived from <I>cultus</I>. Whether in Athens of 5th century B.C. or in Rome of 2nd century A.D. or in the United States of America at the end of the 20th century, culture is most importantly the reflection of what we most venerate; it is the expression of the commanding truths of the time, the truths by which we are obliged, the truths that hold us together -- as in "religion," from the Latin <I>religere</I>, which means to fasten or bind.
<P>
<DD>
That Congress thought it necessary in 1954 to formally declare that this is "one nation under God" reflected not simply a fear of communism, but a deeper anxiety about the culture, about who we are as a people. Supposedly, the 1950s of the Eisenhower era was a time of quiescence, even complacency, in American life. There was an enormous "religion boom," measured by almost every index of belief and behavior, that climaxed in 1959. Intellectuals of the time assured us that it was a period marked by the "end of ideology," when all the really big questions about how we ought to order our life together had been resolved. Yet I expect that such smooth and frequently smug assurances were attended by a deeper anxiety. I expect that many, if not most, who voted to declare that this is "one nation under God" did so because they sensed that it could no longer be taken for granted that this is one nation under God. The 1960s and what followed vindicated such anxiety in spades.
<P>
<DD>
For some, the phrase "one nation under God" means that America is somehow God's elect nation, a chosen people exempt from the corruptions and tragedies that mark the histories of other peoples. I take it to mean, first of all, that we understand ourselves to be a nation under judgment. That is the meaning consonant with the numerous statements of the Founders who explained what they meant by this <I>novus ordo seclorum</I> -- this new order of the ages -- as it is called on the Great Seal of the United States of America. Thus Jefferson, "I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just."
<P>
<DD>
1954 was already far removed from the constituting truths of the founding era. And how far we have now come from 1954. I hold no brief for the idea of a "Christian amendment" to the Constitution, an idea that some have agitated for decades. Such an amendment is unnecessary and mischievously provocative. More important, no nation, and certainly not this nation, is worthy of calling itself Christian. But I do believe, with the Founders, that this experiment in a free and virtuous society cannot be sustained apart from the commanding truths of the culture that gave it birth. How far we have come from the founding, and even from 1954, is made evident in innumerable ways. Not least, it is evident in the fact that those who appeal to the founding vision are today widely condemned as religious fanatics, as aliens and sectarians who would "impose their values on a pluralistic society."
<P>
<DD>
I could easily take up several hours in citing the copious statements that reflect the founding vision of this republican experiment in democratic governance. But simply to jog our memories, permit me to allude to a few. John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court: "Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers, and it is the duty of our Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers."  John Adams, the first Vice President and second President: "Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."  And as recently as 1952, Justice William O. Douglas (of all people!): "We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being."
<P>
<DD>
In 1954, the year in which the Pledge of Allegiance was amended, Chief Justice Earl Warren had this to say: "I believe no one can read the history of our country without realizing that the Good Book and the spirit of the Savior have from the beginning been our guiding geniuses....  Whether we look to the first Charter of Virginia or to the Charter of New England or the Charter of Massachusetts Bay or to the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, the same objective is present... a Christian land governed by Christian principles. I believe the entire Bill of Rights came into being because of the knowledge our forefathers had of the Bible and their belief in it: freedom of belief, of expression, of assembly, of petition, the dignity of the individual, the sanctity of the home, equal justice under law, and the reservation of powers to the people. I like to believe we are living today in the spirit of the Christian religion. I like also to believe that as long as we do so, no great harm can come to our country."
<P>
<DD>
That was 1954. This is now. You may recall that in April of this year, Justice Antonin Scalia spoke of his Christian faith at a law school in Mississippi. Unlike Warren, Scalia did not set forth religious and moral truths that he claimed are normative for the country. Rather, he gave a personal testimony and discussed the difficulties in being a Christian in thoroughly secularized sectors of our elite culture. This was news; this was scandal; and pundits weighed in with alarmed commentary on Scalia's alleged challenge to the separation of church and state. Not only is it no longer permissible to suggest that Christianity is socially normative, as Earl Warren did; it is now no longer permissible for a justice of the Supreme Court to declare in public his personal allegiance to the Christian faith. Scalia described Christians as "fools for Christ," and some commentators, magnificently ignorant of the origins of the phrase, opined that Scalia was admitting his mental incompetence to sit on the Court.
<P>
<DD>
I do not wish to make too much of this one incident. Not because it is unimportant, but because it is only one out of so many incidents reflecting a pattern that I analyzed 12 years ago as "The Naked Public Square" -- public life stripped of all reference to religion and religiously grounded morality. The forthcoming issue of <I>First Things</I> carries a symposium that is titled "The End of Democracy?"  With equal merit, it might have been entitled "The End of Politics?"  The best short definition of politics is given us by Aristotle. Politics, he said, is free people deliberating the question, How ought we to order our life together?  The "ought" in that definition indicates that politics is essentially a moral enterprise. Not, of course, that all politicians are moral, but the enterprise itself is moral in nature.
<P>
<DD>
It is frequently said that you cannot legislate morality. In fact, you cannot legislate anything but morality. Any question of political moment has to do with questions such as justice, equality, fairness, and the common good. All of these are inescapably moral categories. However confused may be their understanding of the connections between morality and religion, for the overwhelming majority of Americans, morality is derived from religion. To interpret the separation of church and state as the separation of religion from public life is, quite simply, a formula for the end of politics. This is why Tocqueville could call religion "the first political institution" of American democracy. His point was that it is from religion, and within the context of religious associations, that most Americans learn the virtues and habits that they bring to the deliberation of the question, How ought we to order our life together?
<P>
<DD>
This is called self-governance, which for the Founders was the key metaphor for understanding our form of government. The late Christopher Lasch wrote incisively in <I>The Revolt of the Elites</I> that in the last half-century, the meaning of "democracy" has changed from self-government to upward mobility. It is now commonly claimed, Lasch observed, that the proof that we are a democratic and open society is that people have the opportunity to move out of the governed masses into the governing elite. The end of politics is accompanied by the rule of judges, regulatory agencies, and other institutions that are least accountable to We the People. To complain about this is not simply a populist twitch. Rather, it is to point out -- soberly, cautiously, and in full awareness of the implications -- that we may no longer be living under the constitutional order that the Founders established, that all of us learned about in our civics textbooks, and that public officials are solemnly sworn to uphold.
<P>
<DD>
Many factors have contributed to the displacement of the former constitutional order and the establishment of the present regime. I realize that, except for the Straussians among us, there is resistance to the term "regime."  Regimes, Americans like to think, are what other countries have. By the term "regime," however, I mean simply the actual, existing system of government, as distinct from the system of government prescribed by the Constitution of the United States. No factor has contributed so powerfully to the new regime as the separation of culture -- meaning <I>cultus</I> -- from the making of law, especially from the making of law by the courts.
<P>
<DD>
Consider, for example, the recent <I>Romer</I> decision in which the Supreme Court overruled the people of Colorado in their democratically approved amendment against special protections for people who define themselves by their homosexual behavior. I ask you to set aside for the moment any views you may have about homosexuality or what laws, if any, there should be about homosexuality. Rather, I would direct your attention to the logic of the majority decision written by Justice Kennedy. According to the Court, the Colorado amendment served no legitimate public purpose and is "inexplicable" apart from an irrational "animus" against homosexuals. Consider what is being said here. The highest court of the land is declaring that five millennia of moral teaching about the right ordering of human sexuality for the personal and communal good has no place in our law. The teaching of Athens, Jerusalem, and 2,000 years of Christian tradition is cavalierly dismissed as irrational animus. The people of Colorado do not believe that; nor, I am confident, do the people of any other state of the Union. But the Supreme Court declares it to be the law of the land. Little wonder that the Court has in recent years worried out loud about the moral legitimacy of the law that it is making.
<P>
<DD>
We are incessantly told that it is impossible to return to the days of the Founders. The Constitution, it is said, is a "living document" responding to the ever-changing needs of a rapidly changing society, and so forth and so on. I believe it is not too much to say that those who talk about a "living Constitution" are in fact saying that the Constitution is dead. For them, it is an infinitely pliable text that, in the words of contemporary literary criticism, has no authorial voice, but only the voice that we attribute to it. We should not want to deny that there have been important changes since the founding period. Of course much has changed in America, and much has changed also for the better. One has only to mention slavery, the thought of which occasioned Jefferson's trembling before the justice of God.
<P>
<DD>
But the changes for the better have always been in obedience to, not in rebellion against, the constituting truths of the American experiment. The most dramatic example in our time is the civil rights movement as it was given magisterial expression by Martin Luther King, Jr. His justly celebrated "I Have a Dream" speech of August 28, 1963, resonates with the constituting and commanding truths, calling for the fulfillment of a promise long delayed. Those who today fear the assertion of moral truth in public argue that ours is an increasingly pluralistic society in which there is no moral truth, but only claims to moral truth in conflict. Such critics typically and greatly exaggerate the change in American society. The survey research of the last 70 years suggests that the American people are at least as committed -- possibly more committed -- to what is broadly construed as the Judeo-Christian moral tradition as they were when Tocqueville described religion as the first political institution of American democracy.

<P>
<DD>
Even were the social changes as dramatic as some suggest, that is all the more reason to reaffirm the constituting truths. Jefferson understood this. Jefferson asked in 1781, "Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God?"  His answer -- and, in similar and frequently identical words, the answer of the other Founders -- was emphatically in the negative. This is an argument that is not being made effectively today. It is precisely as a society becomes more pluralistic, as there are more claims to rights in conflict, that we must appeal to truth that transcends such conflicts.
<P>
<DD>
Why should the majority respect the liberties of troublesome or disagreeable minorities?  The only sustainable answer is that the majority believes that those in the minority possess, in the words of Jefferson, "liberties [that] are of the gift of God."  Remove that transcendent warrant, and all politics is reduced to Nietzsche's "will to power."  Minorities that many Americans find disagreeable are today, I believe, making a fatal mistake. Repudiating the transcendent and commanding truths of our cultural story line, they seek power and protection in a judiciary that has joined in the same act of repudiation. Thus do they stand behind the robes of judges, defying the people who are, in democratic theory and practice, the repository of political sovereignty.
<P>
<DD>
Such minorities seeking rights refuse to join in the democratic deliberation of the question, How ought we to order our life together?  Abandoning the great political task of persuasion, they resort to judicial fiat. What they cannot get from the people and their representatives they believe they can get from the courts. And who can deny that they have had astonishing success with that strategy?  But it is, I believe, a perilously shortsighted strategy. It can lead only to the definitive end of democracy or to a majoritarian reaction that may also be profoundly anti-democratic. In either case, they lose. This is why I have argued that the naked public square is a very dangerous place, especially for minorities. Where there is in the public square no transcendent aspiration to the good, there is no transcendent barrier against the inclination to evil. And so Jefferson's question: "Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God?"  The answer, I am convinced, is "No."
<P>
<DD>
There is a new pluralism in American life, and it is a moral pluralism. It is not because the American people are less attached to what is called the Judeo-Christian moral tradition. It is, rather, a pluralism created by the rise of a new class -- call it the knowledge class, if you will -- that has entrenched itself in the institutions least accountable to the people, and especially in the judiciary. This is the phenomenon that gives form to what are called "the culture wars."  When I first began to write about the culture war many years ago, critics thought the term excessive, especially when I referred to the <I>Kulturkampf</I>, an analogy to Bismarck's campaign of the 1870s to eradicate the influence of religion in German public life. I believe the analogy is apt. What has happened in subsequent years has, in my judgment, only provided added confirmation of the culture war analysis.
<P>
<DD>
Let me say what I mean by culture war. We are two nations: one concentrated on rights and laws, the other on rights and wrongs; one radically individualistic and dedicated to the actualized self, the other communal and invoking the common good; one viewing law as the instrument of the will to power and license, the other affirming an objective moral order reflected in a Constitution to which we are obliged; one given to private satisfaction, the other to familial responsibility; one typically secular, the other typically religious; one elitist, the other populist.
<P>
<DD>
These strokes are admittedly broad, but the reality is evident enough to anyone who attends to the increasingly ugly rancor that dominates and debases our public life. And, of course, for many Americans, the conflicts in the culture wars run through their own hearts. The conflicts also run through our institutions, including the courts. But I believe it is accurate to say that, in a long series of decisions, the Supreme Court -- and therefore, in due course, the entire federal and state judiciary -- has tended to put the law on one side of the culture war.
<P>
<DD>
How I wish -- and perhaps you wish as well!  -- that we could continue this analysis without reference to abortion. Is there no end to this rancorous debate?  The answer is that there is no end in sight. The abortion debate is about ever so much more than abortion. It is about the nature of human life and community. It is about who belongs to the "we" in the question, How ought <I>we</I> to order our life together?  It is about whether rights are the product of human assertion or the gift of "Nature and Nature's God."  It is about doctor-assisted suicide, euthanasia, eugenic engineering, and the protection of the radically handicapped. But the abortion debate is most inescapably about abortion. It is most crucially in that debate that the Supreme Court has gambled its authority, and with it our constitutional order, by coming down on one side in the culture war.
<P>
<DD>
This is most explicitly spelled out in the 1992 decision <I>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</I>, which, of course, is in continuity with the turn taken by <I>Roe</I> and <I>Doe</I> in 1973. The logic, or illogic, is of a piece with <I>Romer</I>, and the Ninth and Second Circuits were justified this year when they appealed to the abortion decisions in claiming that doctor-assisted suicide is a constitutional right. In <I>Casey</I>, the Court most clearly declared its belligerency on one side of the culture war. The decision endorses the radically individualistic concept of the self-constituted self. In what some critics have called "the mystery passage," the Court waxes metaphysical in its assertion that the abortion liberty is necessary in order "to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life."  "Beliefs about these matters," says the Court, "could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State."  Not only does authentic personhood require freedom from the state, but it also requires freedom from other potentially encumbering communities. It requires freedom from spouses, for example. The Court therefore struck down the requirement that fathers be notified before mothers get an abortion. That, it is said, would be an "undue burden."  If abortion is a constitutional right, one might ask, how can it be permissibly burdened at all?  But, of course, it was only declared a constitutional right on January 22, 1973. Before that, it was not only burdened; it was, for the most part, prohibited.
<P>
<DD>
Marriage, the Court declares, is only an "association" of individuals entered into for the fulfillment of personal needs. The notion of the unburdened, unencumbered, autonomous self drives the entirety of the Court's reasoning. In <I>Casey</I> and other decisions, liberty is not the "ordered liberty" of the Founders; nor is it liberty directed to the good and formed by communities of memory and obligation. Rather, liberty is, without remainder, the liberty of self-will, self-expression, and indeed self-constitution. For the Court, as for many Americans, that pitiably reduced concept of liberty "trumps" every other consideration. Which is why the slogans of "choice" serve the pro-abortionists so well.
<P>
<DD>
In the otherwise unfortunate decision, <I>Lee v. Weisman</I>, handed down only a few days before Casey, the Court wisely cautions against the establishment of a state-sponsored "civic religion."  The same justices seem to be blithely unaware, however, that in Casey and other rulings, they are in fact asserting and endorsing a philosophy of at least quasi-religious status. Addressing the "concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life" crosses into those ultimate concerns by which religion is ordinarily defined. As I have argued elsewhere, the naked public square cannot remain naked. Politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum. Something is not simply eliminated; it is displaced by something else. Against alternative understandings of the self in relation to community, normative truth, and even revelation, the Court recognizes no other reality than the isolated individual defining his or her reality.
<P>
<DD>
Thus does the Court reinforce the Hobbesian idea that we are a society of strangers, perhaps of enemies, and it is the chief business of the state to prevent others from interfering with or obliging the Sovereign Self. The result is the atomistic and potentially totalitarian doctrine that society is composed of only two actors, the state and the solitary individual. This is a "civic" religion in the sense of being sponsored by the state, but it is hardly civic in character and consequence. It is in fact the undoing of the <I>civitas</I>, of the "civil society" of myriad persons, associations, and communities of moral tradition interacting within the bond of civility and mutual respect. The description of the self, of community, and of ultimate meaning that is espoused by the Court is incompatible with Christian and Jewish teaching and, I am confident, with the belief and experience of most Americans. It is, in effect although not in name, another religion. It is in fact the Supreme Court's definition of the "concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life."  It is, according to the Court, the national creed established by the Constitution.
<P>
<DD>
I and others have been criticized for raising the question of the moral legitimacy of the existing regime and whether it can any longer command the obedience of conscientious citizens. We did not raise the question. The majority in <I>Casey</I> raised the question of the legitimacy of its authority. The justices of the Court say that they are putting the authority of law itself on the line, and call upon the American people to follow their lead. "Where in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case in such a way as to resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in <I>Roe</I>... its decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry. It is the dimension present whenever the Court's interpretation of the Constitution calls the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution."
<P>
<DD>
That is a truly astonishing assertion, as though We the People have no higher allegiance than our allegiance to the Supreme Court. The Court goes further. It says that citizens will be "tested by following" its decision. Suddenly, it is not the Court but the American people who have been put on trial. We as a people have been here before, and the precedent is not a happy one. Abraham Lincoln had the notorious <I>Dred Scott</I> decision in mind when he said in his First Inaugural Address: "The candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the Government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court... the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their Government into the hands of that eminent tribunal."
<P>
<DD>
As Lincoln contended in his time, a decision of the Supreme Court is not, by virtue of being a decision of the Supreme Court, "the law of the land."  <I>Casey</I>, like <I>Dred Scott</I>, is not the law of the land. It is one wrong decision affirming earlier wrong decisions. So long as it and related decisions stand, they must guide the decisions of other courts, and those in government office must be mindful of that. But the Constitution is the law of the land; contrary to so-called judicial realists, the Constitution is not just whatever the Supreme Court says it is. In this land, in this constitutional order, the people, through their representatives, make the law of the land. Or so it was thought.
<P>
<DD>
Before and after he became President, Lincoln strove earnestly for the overturn of <I>Dred Scott</I>. He failed, and war came. It is almost impossible to imagine that there could be a civil war like the last one. But the destructive effects of anomie and anger are already evident as a result of law divorced from constitutional text, moral argument, and democratic accountability. The ever-fragile bonds of civility are unraveled as politics becomes, to paraphrase Clausewitz, war pursued by other means. Lawless law is an invitation to lawlessness. Four justices dissented in <I>Casey</I>. Justice Scalia wrote in dissent, "Against the Court are the twin facts that the American people love democracy and the American people are not fools."  We must hope he is right; that the people will not forever -- they will not for long -- be denied democracy and treated like fools.
<P>
<DD>
William Lloyd Garrison and his fellow abolitionists publicly burned the Constitution, calling it "a covenant with death and an agreement with hell."  The Court today worries about the angry disillusionment of millions of Americans who have been denied their right to make the case in the political arena for protective abortion law, and for so much else. The justices are right to worry about the moral delegitimation of the Court and the undermining of the rule of law. The course that the majority has chosen is the surest way to the result that they fear.
<P>
<DD>
We do not know what all Congress had in mind back then. No doubt, as is the way with politics, motives were mixed, and some representatives did not know themselves what, if anything, they had in mind. But I would like to think that they were guided, even providentially guided, when they added to the Pledge of Allegiance "one nation under God."  Perhaps they sensed that the implicit assumptions no longer held. It had to be said. Forty-two years later, it is too early to say that their effort, and the experiment they sought to protect, has failed. Or maybe not. Maybe Americans have become so supine, so accustomed to being denied democracy and treated like fools, that they no longer notice or no longer care that they are ruled by government without the consent of the governed. We are in honor bound to hope that is not the case.

<center><h2>MARIJUANA-FIGHTING TEAM LACKS<br>
PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In response to California and Arizona
drug legalization propositions, a Clinton Administration team
presented Monday its campaign against further drug legalization.
&quot;The only problem was that the team was missing its quarterback.
President Clinton needs to personally tackle this national crisis,&quot;
Family Research Council Senior Policy Analyst Lt. Col. Robert
Maginnis said.

<p>

The success of the referenda, which were funded in part by billionaire
legalization entrepreneur George Soros, gives new life to the
national movement towards drug legalization.

<p>

Even before the ballot initiatives passed, marijuana use had been
on the rise for five years.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse's
recent Monitoring the Future Survey shows one in five 10th graders
used marijuana within the past month.

<p>

&quot;Use is up because the pop culture is pro-marijuana,&quot;
Maginnis said, &quot;and using marijuana is lightly portrayed
or treated as inconsequential behavior.  The recent propositions
will further weaken adolescent risk perception.

<p>

&quot;The consequences of not treating this as a crisis are severe.
Medical costs will increase as adolescent use continues to skyrocket,
the number of marijuana-related automobile accidents will rise,
law enforcement problems will abound, and both business and foreign
policy concerns will be complicated.&quot;

<p>

Maginnis said that pot legalization is more widespread than the
California and Arizona propositions, yet the Administration's
plan does not address other pro-marijuana laws.  At one time,
34 states had passed &quot;some endorsement of a medical use of
marijuana.&quot;  Some of these laws are still on the books and
have been re-energized by the recent referenda successes.  Virginia,
for example, has a criminal law that permits crude marijuana use
solely based on the recommendation of a physician from any state.

<p>

&quot;This is a national problem that requires the president's
personal attention,&quot; Maginnis said.  &quot;President Clinton
has already said: 'We cannot walk away from the fight against
drugs...we have to walk right into it.'  Mr. President, you must
now 'walk right into' this battle.  Don't send your subordinates
out to do what only you can do.  Pro-pot forces will stop at nothing
to advance their cause -- they already have a big foot in the
door.  Don't turn your back on our children.&quot;

<P>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
<dd>On July 1, 1997, Britain will cede sovereignty over the territory of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China. This transfer of sovereignty is the result of negotiations between Britain and China during the 1980s, and is an outcome the United States cannot change. The United States, however, does have substantial interests at stake in Hong Kong -- interests that will endure long after the transfer of sovereignty next July. The foremost concern of the United States during the transition from British to Chinese sovereignty is the security of the more than 35,000 U.S. citizens and 1,000 U.S. firms that reside in Hong Kong. Beyond this most fundamental national interest, the United States has an interest in maintaining close cooperation with Hong Kong authorities in fighting such international security threats as drug trafficking, money laundering, illegal immigration, and the proliferation of weapons and sensitive technologies.
<p>
<dd>
The Hong Kong transition will have a tremendous impact on the long-held interests of the United States in regional peace and stability as well as market access. Because much of U.S. trade and investment in China flows through Hong Kong, a continued free, open, and safe business environment in Hong Kong is vitally important to U.S. access to China's markets. More important, the approach Beijing takes in dealing with free market democracy in Hong Kong will be a key indicator of how Beijing intends to deal with Taiwan and other free market democracies in Asia. Encroachment on the freedom and autonomy of Hong Kong, or an assertive Chinese military presence there, will fuel cross-strait tensions with Taiwan and heighten already growing security concerns throughout Asia.
<p>
<dd>The legal basis for the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong is the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong signed on December 19, 1984.<sup>1</sup> The Joint Declaration is a bilateral treaty registered with the United Nations, and its principles were incorporated into Chinese law as the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China -- sometimes called Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution. The Basic Law was passed by the National People's Congress on April 4, 1990.<sup>2</sup> China's collective promises to Hong Kong in the Joint Declaration and Basic Law can be summed up in one phrase: Hong Kong people will govern Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy. Beijing will take on the responsibilities of defense and foreign affairs for Hong Kong, but all other legal, social, and economic issues will be left to the discretion of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government.
<p>
<dd>The United States recognized the Joint Declaration as a legitimate international treaty in the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. The Hong Kong Policy Act declares U.S. support for developing democracy in Hong Kong, protecting human rights, and maintaining Hong Kong's confidence and prosperity as it fulfills its role as an international financial center. The Act also requires the Secretary of State to transmit annual reports to Congress on developments related to the transfer of sovereignty as they relate to U.S. interests in Hong Kong. This annual report must address such topics as the openness and fairness of elections for the Legislative Council and the Chief Executive, the independence of the judiciary, and the status of Hong Kong's Bill of Rights. But because the United States is not a party to this treaty, the U.S. government does not offer any legal interpretation of British or Chinese obligations under this international agreement.
<p>
<dd>As July 1 draws nearer, key questions remain about Beijing's willingness or ability to keep its word with regard to Hong Kong's level of autonomy and the preservation of its economic, cultural, and social way of life. Questions also remain about what, if anything, the United States can do to ensure that the commitments made in the Joint Declaration are fulfilled. Beijing plans temporarily to replace Hong Kong's democratically elected Legislative Council with an appointed provisional legislature and has left unclear what role pro-democracy parties will play in Hong Kong's post-1997 government. Similarly, it remains unclear to what extent Beijing intends to micromanage Hong Kong, as opposed to simply handling its defense and foreign affairs.
<p>
<dd>To protect U.S. interests and to help preserve the freedom, stability, and prosperity of Hong Kong, the United States should:
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>Beware of the impact U.S. policy toward China has on Hong Kong.</b> Politically generated trade friction between the United States and China, such as is created by threats to revoke China's most favored nation trading status, puts U.S. interests in Hong Kong in jeopardy and destabilizes Hong Kong.
 <p>
 <li><b>Articulate U.S. interests in Hong Kong to leaders in China.</b> A clear understanding of how the United States intends to protect the security of the 35,000 U.S. citizens and 1,000 U.S. firms in Hong Kong, as well as its multibillion-dollar investment and trade interests, will help China's leaders avoid miscalculation when responding to U.S. actions in Hong Kong.
 <p>
 <li><b>Maintain a strong U.S. presence in Hong Kong.</b> U.S. officials, businessmen, students, and tourists are a vital source of information, and their presence demonstrates to the people of Hong Kong that the United States is observing the transition process carefully.
 <p>
 <li><b>Strongly urge Beijing to allow the current democratically elected Legislative Council to serve out its term.</b> If Beijing insists on replacing the current legislature, the United States should urge Beijing to shorten the term of the provisional legislature by preparing now for elections to take place as soon after July 1 as possible.
 <p>
 <li><b>Support Hong Kong's continued participation in international organizations.</b> As the world's freest economy, Hong Kong should play a key role in international organizations in leading the world toward a more free and open trading system.
 <p>
 <li><b>Urge Beijing to sign international human rights covenants.</b> Such a move by China would assuage the fears that led Hong Kong's residents to demand a Bill of Rights Ordinance in the first place.
 <p>
 <li><b>Closely cooperate with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government to fight drug trafficking, money laundering, alien smuggling, and commercial piracy.</b> For this cooperation to work, it is important that the United States not allow differences with Beijing to alienate or put at risk the new SAR government.
</ul>
<p>
<b>HONG KONG'S COLONIAL HISTORY: FROM A BARREN ROCK TO THE PEARL OF THE ORIENT</b>
<p>
<dd>
In 1841, after learning that Hong Kong island would be ceded to Britain, Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston described Hong Kong as "a barren island with hardly a house upon it." After more than a century and a half of colonial management, Hong Kong touts a standard of living that surpasses Britain's and is described by many as the "Pearl of the Orient" or the "Crown Jewel" of the British empire. Britain established a system of common law to protect property and civil rights in Hong Kong. This sound legal system, its large deep-sea ports, and its proximity to Canton (Guangzhou), made Hong Kong an ideal gateway into the China market.
<p>
<dd>
Hong Kong unexpectedly became a gateway for Chinese immigrants as well, despite its tough legal restrictions on immigration. Few thought that the Chinese would cross over and live under a foreign flag, but millions have thrived under liberal British rule. They traditionally asked little of the colonial government, other than to be left alone. Large flows of immigrants coincided with traumatic events on the mainland -- the collapse of the Qing (Manchu) Dynasty early in this century, the Chinese civil war during the 1940s, and the Great Proletariat Cultural Revolution in the 1960s.
<p>
<dd>Hong Kong's legal system, port facilities, proximity, <I>laissez faire</I> government, and abundant supply of immigrant labor are the key ingredients in what has become one of the greatest economic miracles of the modern age. During the 1950s and 1960s, the United Nations embargo on trade with China forced Hong Kong to turn inward and develop a light industrial manufacturing base. After China began to reopen for trade in the 1970s and 1980s, Hong Kong resumed its role as entrepot for global trade with China. Because of their familiarity with the language, government, and business practices in both cultures, Hong Kong's people have been excellent go-betweens for China and the predominantly Western trading world. Hong Kong's <I>laissez faire</I> business environment of limited government, low taxes, and free capital flows is still tremendously successful at attracting foreign resources to match up with trade and investment opportunities in China. Indeed, Hong Kong has the freest economy in the world, according to the 1997 Heritage Foundation/Wall Street Journal <a href="/heritage/index"><i>Index of Economic Freedom</i></a>. In this way, a barren rock with virtually no natural resources transformed itself into one of the most advanced, prosperous, and free trading economies in the world.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<dd>For China, however, Hong Kong's colonial success has not necessarily been a source of pride. The Treaty of Nanjing, which ceded Hong Kong to Britain at the end of the first Sino-British war in 1842, was viewed by the Chinese as the first in a series of "unequal treaties" imposed on China by imperialist foreign powers and marked the beginning of what the Chinese call a "century of national humiliation."
<p>
<dd>
During this time of national weakness from the 1840s through the 1940s, Germany, France, Russia, Britain, and Japan carved out safe havens, or spheres of influence, in key cities along China's coastline. Internal rebellion and foreign encroachment led to the fall of the Qing (Manchu) Dynasty, and China disintegrated into a period of regional warlordism during the 1920s. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s the Nationalists and the Communists engaged in a long and costly struggle for legitimacy over a reunified China, interrupted temporarily by the Japanese occupation of much of China (including Hong Kong) during World War II.
<p>
<dd>Thus, when the Communists took control in 1949, China was a poor and backward nation ravaged by famine and war. The Communists succeeded in unifying all of China, save Taiwan and Hong Kong, under one central government. Because of this history, the Chinese assign symbolic importance to Hong Kong as the first national wound suffered during this long period of setbacks. From Beijing's point of view, the "Pearl of the Orient" should be returned to China to continue the process of national reunification.
<p>
<b>CHINA'S FORMULA FOR NATIONAL REUNIFICATION: "ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS"</b>
<p>
<dd>
A shift in Chinese policy from open hostility toward capitalism in the 1950s and 1960s to a more peaceful accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s was made possible by two significant developments: (1) Deng Xiaoping's modernization plan, and (2) Western diplomatic normalization. The normalization of diplomatic relations with the West, especially with the United States and Japan in the early 1970s, eased China's security concerns and opened the way for the development of foreign trade and investment. Deng saw the Western system of trade and investment as a means to modernize China and raise the living standards of the Chinese people. The Chinese territories of Taiwan and Hong Kong, because of their connections and success within the Western capitalist system, would make ideal intermediaries between socialist China and the capitalist West. Similarly, modernization and economic reform in China, according to Deng, would make peaceful rapprochement and eventual reunification with Taiwan and Hong Kong easier.
<p>
<dd>The concept of "one country, two systems" gradually evolved into a means for China's national reunification in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The concept, attributed to Deng, was that separate and autonomous socioeconomic systems could co-exist within a single, sovereign nation. In Deng's view, a socialist mainland and a capitalist Taiwan could co-exist peacefully within one China. At the time, Taiwan was the primary target of this peaceful reunification strategy. During the 1970s, the United States and other major world powers shifted diplomatic recognition away from the Republic of China on Taiwan to the People's Republic of China on the mainland.<sup>4</sup> Because of China's strategic importance, diplomatic clout, and economic potential, many analysts, especially on the mainland, considered reunification with Taiwan to be inevitable and near.
<p>
<dd>By 1982, however, the near-term prospects for reunification with Taiwan dimmed as China and the United States clashed over the issue of continued U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Hong Kong and Macau began to arise in Chinese public commentary on the "one country, two systems" model. In February 1982, Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang said, "Besides the implementation of the open-door economic policy, we will, in the near future, adopt another method -- the method of allowing the existence of two kinds of <i>social</i> systems in one country -- to solve the problems of the reunification with Taiwan and the recovery of our sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macau."<sup>5</sup>
<p>
<dd>
That same year, land owners and investors in Hong Kong became increasingly concerned that legal rights granted under agreements signed prior to the July 1, 1997, expiration of the New Territories lease would remain in force for their full term. Business interests in Hong Kong intensified pressure on the British government to secure written guarantees for property rights in the New Territories after 1997. Fifteen years is a typical term for a mortgage or lease of land. Thus, by 1982, both Britain and China felt compelled to resolve the post-1997 status of the New Territories and Hong Kong.
<p>
<dd>When negotiations with Britain over the future of Hong Kong began in late 1982, China already had formulated its strategy for returning Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty. The Sino-British Joint Declaration that emerged in 1984 represents a more concrete articulation of the policy with which the Chinese entered into the negotiations. It commits China to allow Hong Kong people to rule Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy, except in the areas of defense and foreign affairs. It also obliges China to allow Hong Kong's separate social and economic systems to remain unchanged for at least 50 years, and to preserve the current rights and freedoms of individuals. The tenets of the Joint Declaration were later incorporated into Chinese law in the 1990 Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. From this point forward, Hong Kong, instead of Taiwan, was destined to become the first test case for Deng's "one country, two systems" theory.
<p>
<dd><b>Tiananmen Disrupts the Transition.</b> Throughout the 1980s, Deng's reforms achieved remarkable results. The pace and direction of change in China was viewed very favorably in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the United States. There was a reasonably high degree of confidence in the viability of the Joint Declaration and the prospects for a smooth transition in Hong Kong. There were also high hopes for improvement in cross-strait relations with Taiwan. Many outside observers believed that political reform naturally would follow such rapid and impressive economic liberalization.
<p>
<dd>The Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, however, destroyed that optimism and planted seeds of skepticism and distrust between Beijing and its counterparts in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the United States. The student-led demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square during May and June 1989, and their brutal suppression on June 4, profoundly changed the way Hong Kong and Beijing viewed one another. During the demonstrations, supporters from Hong Kong sent food and supplies to the students on the square. Some Hong Kong democracy activists even traveled to Beijing to be with the students. The day after China's military crushed the student uprising, more than 1 million residents filled Hong Kong streets in protest of Beijing's excessive authoritarianism.
<p>
<dd>The governments in Beijing and Hong Kong each enacted legislation to address the fears provoked by the Tiananmen incident. For example, in 1990 Beijing amended the Basic Law to keep Hong Kong activists out of China's politics. Article 23 was intended to protect China's political system from any future interference by forces within Hong Kong or from the outside. The article states, "The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People's Government, or theft of state secrets, to prohibit foreign political organizations or bodies from conducting political activities in the Region, and to prohibit political organizations or bodies of the Region from establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies." Article 23 has raised serious concerns in Hong Kong about how Beijing would interpret the article and what impact it will have on civil rights in the soon-to-be Special Administrative Region.
<p>
<dd><b>Hong Kong's Bill of Rights Ordinance.</b> Hong Kong authorities had their own reaction to the massacre. Tiananmen Square provided the impetus to institutionalize Hong Kong's body of human rights law in a comprehensive statute that would establish unambiguously the primacy of basic human rights guarantees.<sup>6</sup> This statute became the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, enacted in June 1991. The Bill of Rights Ordinance codified the protections elaborated in the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights into Hong Kong law.<sup>7</sup> This ordinance appears to be consistent with the Joint Declaration and Basic Law and should not have drawn any objection from Beijing.
<p>
<dd>
Beijing objects to the Bill of Rights Ordinance. The Bill of Rights calls for the repeal of all laws that contravene it or are inconsistent with it. China, however, has declared that the Basic Law will be the supreme law of Hong Kong. Beijing therefore posits that the Bill of Rights Ordinance raises questions as to which law -- the Basic Law or the Bill of Right Ordinance -- has primacy. Moreover, Beijing also claims that the human rights protections contained in the Basic Law are adequate, so the Bill of Rights Ordinance is, therefore, unnecessary. On these two grounds, a Beijing-appointed group has proposed a selective repeal of portions of the Bill of Rights Ordinance.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
<dd>Beijing also has rejected the report's obligations of the international covenants. The covenants require the sovereign of Hong Kong to submit reports to the United Nations on the implementation of the covenants in the territory. Although China has promised that the provisions of the international human rights covenants as currently applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force after 1997, it still has refused to submit reports on Hong Kong on the grounds that Beijing itself is not a signatory to the covenants.
<p>
<dd>Beijing's refusal to abide by the reporting obligations of the international covenants on human rights, together with the proposal of a selective repeal of the Bill of Rights Ordinance, have raised serious concerns in Hong Kong and abroad. Indeed the question arises as to why Beijing would choose to press this issue at all. Even if the Bill of Rights is superfluous in light of the promises made in the Basic Law, if it grants the residents of Hong Kong an added degree of confidence or peace of mind, why not leave it alone?
<p>
<dd><b>Legislative Council Elections in Hong Kong.</b> Accelerating the development of democracy was the second step Hong Kong took to protect its people from Tiananmen-style oppression. This was done by opening all seats on the Hong Kong Legislative Council to elections. Prior to 1991, all seats in the Legislative Council were appointed or elected indirectly. Unfortunately, democratic reform was late in coming to Hong Kong. Indirect election to the Legislative Council was partially introduced as late as 1985, and by the late 1980s, domestic demand for direct elections was on the rise. In the aftermath of the Tiananmen massacre, Governor Chris Patten was sent to Hong Kong with a mandate, from London as well as from within Hong Kong, to accelerate Hong Kong's democratization process. Although recent elections have taken place at the district and municipal levels, attention has been focused most keenly on the Legislative Council.
<p>
<dd>
In 1992, Governor Patten proposed measures toward a more accountable and democratic political system. In June 1994, following 17 rounds of unsuccessful talks between Britain and China, and over Beijing's strong objections, the Legislative Council approved proposals to: (1) lower the voting age from 21 to 18; (2) open all District and Municipal Board seats to direct election; and (3) increase significantly the number of voters selecting Legislative Council seats through indirect elections. In addition, the Hong Kong government opened all Legislative Council seats to elections in 1995.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
<dd>
The September 1995 Legislative Council elections were fair and open, and resulted in the most representative and democratic legislative body in Hong Kong's history. Even pro-Beijing politicians disputed early charges in the local Beijing-controlled press that the elections had been unfair.<sup>10</sup> The strong showing of pro-democracy candidates in the 1995 legislative election in Hong Kong is a clear signal that the people do not trust Beijing's pledges to respect their autonomy and freedoms.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
<dd>
China strongly opposed Hong Kong's electoral reforms and questioned the legitimacy of the 1995 elections on two grounds. First, Beijing claimed that the reforms violated the promise in the Joint Declaration that the "laws currently in force in Hong Kong will remain basically unchanged."<sup>12</sup> Second, Beijing objected to Hong Kong's proceeding with its reform package without Beijing's prior approval. In retaliation, Beijing declared that the newly elected Legislative Council would not be permitted to serve out its four-year term (through 1999). Instead, Beijing plans to replace the Legislative Council with an appointed provisional legislature on July 1, 1997, which will serve until elections for a new Legislative Council can be held on Beijing's watch (sometime before June 30, 1998).<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Article 68 of the Basic Law stipulates that the
<p><blockquote>
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be constituted by election. The method for forming the Legislative Council shall be specified in the light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress. The ultimate aim is the election of all the members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage.
</blockquote>
<p>
<dd>
It is difficult to understand how the elections in any way violated these principles, even if the process went beyond the parameters prescribed in an Annex of the Basic Law.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Both the Bill of Rights Ordinance and the Legislative Council elections were direct responses to Beijing's excessive authoritarianism at Tiananmen. In both cases, Beijing has failed to explain to the people of Hong Kong why it objects to these developments if it really intends to follow through on promises made in the Joint Declaration. There is a real concern in Hong Kong that a provisional legislature appointed by pro-Beijing operatives would place limits on the freedoms protected in the Bill of Rights Ordinance. There is also a real concern that Legislative Council elections held after July 1, 1997, may not be free and fair and may exclude groups or individuals who are critical of Beijing.
<p>
<b>U.S. CONCERN FOR HONG KONG</b>
<p>
<dd>

There are several reasons for the United States to be concerned about how the transition in Hong Kong unfolds. The United States first must be concerned about the high security and economic stakes at risk in the transition. Traditional U.S. interests in Asia are maintaining peace and stability, freedom of navigation, and access to markets, and keeping any one power from dominating the region to the exclusion of the United States. A failed transition in Hong Kong would threaten the U.S. interest in regional peace and stability. It would destabilize not only Hong Kong, but China's relations with its Asian neighbors and the United States as well. It also would increase the likelihood of armed conflict in the Taiwan Straits, the South China Sea, or the East China Sea.
<p>
<dd>As one of the most free and efficient ports in the world, Hong Kong is vital to U.S. interests in free navigation and access to markets, especially the China market. Hong Kong is an important entrepot for trade between United States and China. In 1995, 42 percent ($4.9 billion) of U.S. goods destined for China and 60 percent ($27.4 billion) of China's exports to the United States were routed through Hong Kong.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Hong Kong is an important economic partner with the United States. Hong Kong is the 11th largest export market and 15th largest trading partner of the United States. Hong Kong itself imported $14.2 billion worth of goods from the United States in 1995, up 25 percent from 1994. Hong Kong was also home to $13.8 billion in direct foreign investment in 1995 alone. Most important, the United States has an interest in protecting the property of over 1,000 U.S. firms and the safety of more than 35,000 U.S. citizens that reside in Hong Kong.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
<dd>
<b>Hong Kong's Dependence on Trade.</b> Hong Kong's dependence on foreign trade is a cause for concern because a loss of autonomy could diminish its global competitiveness and put at risk the jobs of millions of workers. In 1995, the total value of Hong Kong's trade amounted to $367 billion, or around 256 percent of gross domestic product. Hong Kong was the world's eighth largest trader in goods in 1995.<sup>17</sup> Such heavy reliance on trade makes Hong Kong vulnerable to government interference, either by undermining competitiveness through burdensome regulation or politicizing its economic institutions.
<p>
<dd><b>Limitations on Freedoms and Democracy.</b> Limitations on freedoms and democracy in Hong Kong are of concern to not only political activists, but businessmen as well. Imposed political limitations unintentionally may diminish economic growth and market efficiency. Beijing's intention to replace the Legislative Council and limit the application of two international covenants on human rights raises serious questions about its tolerance for freedom and democracy within its "one country, two systems" model. Similarly, China's harassment of Hong Kong reporter Xi Yang, together with the widespread fear of self-censorship in the Hong Kong press, has caused concern about the viability of freedom of the press after 1997. A free press is not only vital to democracy; the free and efficient flow of information is also vital to free markets.
<p>
<dd>
<b>Corruption and the Rule of Law.</b> With the establishment of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong, many have feared that the corruption that has plagued business in China will find its way into Hong Kong. One of Hong Kong's main attractions has been the clean, modern business and legal environment it provides for foreigners to conduct business with China. Notwithstanding the real success of the Independent Commission Against Corruption in fighting corruption in Hong Kong since 1975, the import of Chinese-style corruption greatly would diminish the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a regional operations center for international business.
<p>
<dd>
Hong Kong has a standard of living that exceeds that of Britain, Sweden, and most other West European countries. It is the fourth largest trading power in the world after the European Union, the United States, and Japan, and the fourth largest financial center after London, New York, and Tokyo. None of these benefits would be enjoyed if Hong Kong were not served by a mature, efficient, and incorrupt legal and judicial system.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
<dd>
<b>The People's Liberation Army.</b> The role of the People's Liberation Army in Hong Kong after 1997 is critical to the success or failure of the transition. An assertive military presence will undermine confidence in Hong Kong's future autonomy. China's military -- the People's Liberation Army (PLA) -- will replace the British Garrison currently stationed in Hong Kong as part of the transition process. The mission of the PLA in Hong Kong is to provide for the territory's defense, and interference in the local affairs of the Region is forbidden. But Article 14 of the Basic Law states that the SAR government can ask Beijing "for assistance from the [PLA] garrison in the maintenance of public order." With Tiananmen still fresh in their minds, some Hong Kong residents want protection from, not the protection of, the PLA. And if the Chief Executive of the SAR is appointed by Beijing, the people of Hong Kong will wonder how cautious he will be about requesting such "assistance."
<p>
<b>REASONS FOR OPTIMISM</b>
<p>
<dd>

Notwithstanding these concerns, there are also reasons for optimism. The stakes in Hong Kong are high not only for the Hong Kong and the United States, but for China as well. More than any other country, China needs an autonomous Hong Kong to bring in goods and capital, to keep Taiwan from declaring independence, and to prop up the legitimacy of Communist Party rule that has lost its ideological appeal. These substantial incentives for China to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy, on balance, cause the reasons for optimism to outweigh the causes for concern.
<p>
<dd><b>China's Economic Dependence on Hong Kong.</b> Hong Kong's high level of investment in China, not to mention China's high level of investment in Hong Kong, may be Hong Kong's best security guarantee. Hong Kong plays a vital role in facilitating trade and investment with China. Moreover China's economic development depends on foreign investment and trade. Because China's access to foreign trade and investment depends on the continued rule of law and free flow of capital, goods, and information in Hong Kong, Beijing may not be inclined to do anything to destabilize or undermine international confidence in Hong Kong. Doing otherwise could deal a fatal blow to its own economic development.
<p>
<dd>Hong Kong is the engine that drives China's economic reform process. It fuels China's economy with investment capital and facilitates merchandise trade. Hong Kong accounts for one-third of China's annual foreign exchange earnings and nearly 60 percent of all foreign direct investment contracted in China since 1979. It is China's largest export market, taking in 24 percent of China's total exports in 1995. Hong Kong also provides increased employment and skilled labor for China. It is estimated that around 122,000 residents of Hong Kong currently work in China, and Hong Kong firms employ more than 4 million Chinese workers in neighboring Guangdong province alone.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Hong Kong is the most important entrepot for China because about half of China's exports are handled by Hong Kong. Out of Hong Kong's total re-exports ($143.8 billion in 1995), 88 percent either originated from or are destined for China. Since 1978, re-exports of Chinese-origin goods through Hong Kong increased by 177 times, from $781 million in 1978 to $92 billion in 1995. Re-exports to China through Hong Kong rose dramatically by 1,794 times, from $46 million in 1978 to $49 billion in 1995.
<p>
<dd>China also has substantial investments in Hong Kong. Almost every province, region, and municipality in China now has resident representative offices, agents, or distributors in Hong Kong. At the end of 1995, there were 1,800 mainland Chinese enterprises registered in Hong Kong, with total assets valued at $50 billion. As of December 1994, 18 of the 185 licensed banks in Hong Kong were China-owned. The Bank of China and its 12 sister banks are now the second largest banking group in Hong Kong, after Hongkong Bank. Hong Kong's financial markets are a natural vehicle for the raising of capital by Chinese companies, and Hong Kong's banking system, the best in Asia, is a natural haven for Chinese savings.
<p>
<dd><b>Communist Party Legitimacy.</b> China's Communist Party's need for a successful transition in Hong Kong to bolster its own legitimacy is another reason for optimism about Hong Kong's future autonomy. The Communist Party has made reunification of the motherland a key pillar of its legitimacy. Increasing the living standards of the Chinese people is the second pillar. A turbulent assimilation of Hong Kong into Chinese sovereignty would threaten to destroy both pillars and thereby undermine the legitimacy of Communist Party rule in China. A destabilized Hong Kong would obstruct the vital flow of foreign investment and trade that supports Beijing's current economic reform and modernization. The failure to sustain economic growth and development along with the failure to fulfill the mission of national reunification thoroughly would undercut both pillars of Communist Party legitimacy.
<p>
<dd><b>The Taiwan Factor.</b> The dramatic effect an infringement on Hong Kong's promised autonomy would have on the independence movement in Taiwan is another reason for optimism. The importance of Taiwan in Beijing's Hong Kong calculations cannot be overstated. China's "one country, two systems" model was crafted with reunification with Taiwan in mind, and Hong Kong is the critical first test of this model. Although a successful transition in Hong Kong is no guarantee that the "one country, two systems" approach will work with Taiwan, a failed transition would eliminate virtually any possibility of peaceful reunification with Taiwan. Nothing would mobilize domestic and international support for Taiwan's independence -- an outcome Beijing wants desperately to avoid -- more than a botched transition in Hong Kong.
<p>
<dd><b>Familiarity with the Mainland.</b> Hong Kong's familiarity with mainland China is another reason to be optimistic about the success of the transition. Hong Kong's transfer to mainland sovereignty is no blind date. To residents of Hong Kong, China is a known quantity. In fact, Hong Kong's prosperity today is a testament to its knowledge of and ability to work within the Chinese system. The wealthy in Hong Kong achieved that status because of their connections inside China and in the West. They have profited from helping join foreign capital with opportunity in China. For this small but very influential group, the transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty is a matter of politics catching up with economic reality.
<p>
<dd><b>Progress of the Joint Liaison Group.</b> Significant progress has been made to adapt Hong Kong's independent legal and judicial systems to post-1997 requirements. Since 1984, the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group has done a tremendous amount of work to pave the way toward a smooth transition. Major achievements of the Joint Liaison Group include the Sino-British agreement on the construction of the new airport, the establishment of the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, Hong Kong's continued participation in 30 international organizations, and the continued application of some 200 multilateral treaties to Hong Kong after 1997.
<P>
<b>THE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES</b>
<p>
<dd>
Even though a successful transition that maintains Hong Kong's high level of autonomy clearly serves China's own best interests, the United States must remain vigilant in its efforts to protect U.S. interests at risk in the transition. The United States must protect the many U.S. citizens and businesses in Hong Kong as well as minimize the risk to market access and regional peace and stability generated by uncertainty over Hong Kong's future. U.S. interests will be served best by a realization of the level of autonomy promised Hong Kong in the Joint Declaration. To protect U.S. interests and help preserve the freedom, stability, and prosperity of Hong Kong, the United States should:
<p><ul>

 <li><b>Beware of the impact U.S. policy toward China has on Hong Kong.</b> Protection of U.S. interests in Hong Kong depends very much on the China policy of the U.S. government. Hong Kong's success is built upon bringing Western capital together with Asian opportunity. No relationship is more important to Hong Kong's continued success than that between the world's largest developed country, the United States, and the world's largest developing country, China. Politically generated trade friction between the United States and China, such as is created by threats to revoke China's most favored nation trading status, puts U.S. interests in Hong Kong in jeopardy and destabilizes Hong Kong.
 <p>
 <li><b>Articulate U.S. interests in Hong Kong to leaders in China.</b> A clear and unambiguous understanding of how the United States intends to protect the security of the 35,000 U.S. citizens and 1,000 U.S. firms in Hong Kong, as well as its multibillion-dollar investment and trade interests, will help China's leaders avoid miscalculation when responding to U.S. actions in Hong Kong. These interests are communicated best through frequent face-to-face interaction between the leaders of the United States and China at the highest levels. These interests should be articulated in both capitals and in a formal setting that reflects the importance the United States attaches to achieving U.S. interests through cooperation.
 <p>
 <li><b>Maintain a strong U.S. presence in Hong Kong.</b> U.S. officials, businessmen, students, journalists, and tourists are a vital source of information about the transition in Hong Kong. Their presence demonstrates to the people of Hong Kong that the United States has not abandoned them and is carefully observing the transition process.
 <p>
 <li><b>Strongly urge Beijing to allow the current democratically elected Legislative Council to serve out its term.</b> If Beijing insists on replacing the current legislature, the United States should urge it to shorten the term of the provisional legislature by preparing now for elections to take place as soon after July 1, 1997, as possible.
 <p>
 <li><b>Support Hong Kong's continued participation in international organizations.</b> Considering Beijing's promises of autonomy, including Hong Kong's separate currency and tax system, Hong Kong deserves to represent the interests of its economy in international forums. As the world's freest economy, Hong Kong should play a key role in international organizations in leading the world toward a more free and open trading system.
 <p>
 <li><b>Urge Beijing to sign international human rights covenants.</b> Such a covenant would resolve the issue of whether Beijing will, as the British have, make annual reports to the United Nations on the status of human rights conditions in Hong Kong. This also would assuage the fears that prompted Hong Kong residents to demand a Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.
 <p>
 <li><b>Closely cooperate with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government to fight drug trafficking, money laundering, alien smuggling, and commercial piracy.</b> This cooperation is of critical strategic importance to the United States. For this cooperation to work, it is important that the United States not allow differences with Beijing to alienate or put at risk the new SAR government.
</ul>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p><dd>

The transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China is not simply a domestic Chinese issue. It is a historic event with global implications. Hong Kong will be the critical first test of China's "one country, two systems" model for national reunification, and it also will be a test of China's ability to deal with a democracy and free market in its midst. How China deals with Hong Kong's free market democracy will be a key indication of how it intends to deal with Taiwan and other free market democracies in Asia. In the balance will be global strategic and economic interests, as well as the fate of China's economic modernization. A successful and smooth transition in Hong Kong is vitally important to China and the world.
<p><dd>
The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration promises that Hong Kong's people will rule Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy. The United States has recognized the Joint Declaration as an international treaty. It is, therefore, a matter of international law that both parties to this treaty abide by the solemn obligations undertaken in the Joint Declaration. The United States must be strong in urging Beijing to grant Hong Kong the level of autonomy promised in the Joint Declaration.
<p><dd>
China must come to terms with the impact on Hong Kong of its aggression at Tiananmen Square. Many of the challenges China faces in this transition process are direct responses to Tiananmen and are, therefore, of China's own making. The reassurances that the people of Hong Kong seek -- a local Bill of Rights and a democratically elected legislature -- are not too much to ask. The promises made in the Joint Declaration are sufficient to protect the future freedom, stability, and prosperity of Hong Kong.
<p><dd>
At present, the reasons for optimism about Hong Kong's future autonomy outweigh the causes for concern, but the several U.S. economic and security interests at stake in Hong Kong will be secure only if promises made in the Joint Declaration are kept.

Over half the witnesses testifying before committees of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives during the budget-slashing 104th Congress were funded directly by the federal taxpayer. In 1995, 35 percent of witnesses were federal employees; of the remaining "public" witnesses, one of every three was a government grant recipient. Grant recipients testified during the 104th Congress roughly 6,000 times: 3,000 times a year, or an average of a dozen times every working day.
<p>
<dd>
The preponderance of government-funded and government-employed witnesses is one reason that even committed budget-cutters had a difficult time reducing federal spending: They hear mostly one side of the story. Moreover, a review of their testimony reveals that almost none of these witnesses disclosed the amount and source of their government funding, whether grants or contracts. Simple disclosure would be the first step toward a more balanced congressional hearing process. Committee members appear to be unaware of the high percentage of government-subsidized witnesses appearing before them. More important, because it is so rarely recognized, the potentially self-serving nature of grant-recipients' testimony is almost never addressed.
<p>
<dd>
While it may be important for Congress to listen to federal grant recipients 3,000 times per year, it is at least equally important that Members of Congress -- to say nothing of the public -- know exactly who is trying to persuade them. Congress should adopt a "Truth in Testimony" rule requiring grant recipients to disclose the amount and source of their grants in written congressional testimony. A Truth in Testimony rule has been introduced in the House by Representative John Doolittle (R-CA) and is being considered for inclusion in the rules change package for the opening of the 105th Congress.
<p>
<b>BACKGROUND: THE CULTURE OF SPENDING</b>
<p>
<dd>
Although the impact of such testimony can be enormous, few have studied the general tenor of testimony to see what impact it might have on the legislative process. In his 1991 book <i>The Culture of Spending</i>, economist James L. Payne calculated that approximately 96 percent of witnesses before selected congressional committees testified in support of government programs or spending.<sup>1</sup>  Payne concluded that Congressmen find themselves almost cocooned in a pro-spending environment. Every Member of Congress is subject to the influence of pro-spending arguments while attending dozens of hearings each year and listening to calls for federal action that meet with little opposition. Bureaucrats boast about the success of their agencies and ask for more funding to continue their work; interest groups point out how many of their members depend on federal programs. Moreover, such pleas for federal initiatives are often reiterated by lobbyists, grassroots campaigns, or informal contacts.
<p>
<b>AN AVALANCHE OF SELF-SERVING TESTIMONY</b>
<p>
<dd>The Heritage Foundation conducted a Congress-wide study of the prevalence of testimony by witnesses with a direct financial interest in federal spending. The results indicate undeniably that congressional hearings are dominated by persons who depend on the federal treasury: Well over half of all congressional witnesses rely on the federal government for grants, contracts, or salaries. A review of 3,400 witnesses testifying before the 15 House and Senate committees for which complete 1995 witness lists were available reveals that:
<p>
<ul>
<li>More than one in five of all witnesses before Congress (22 percent) represents an organization that receives grants directly from the federal government. This amounts to one of every three witnesses who are not federal employees. Examples include representatives of Native American Indian tribes, nonprofit groups like the Urban Institute or the Environmental Defense Fund, and state or local agencies like the Texas Water Commission or the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Given the enormous breadth of these federal discretionary grants -- over 40,000 groups receive an estimated $39 billion in grants from dozens of executive branch agencies each year -- Members of Congress may not know that witnesses are directly dependent on the very programs they are promoting.
<p>
<li>Federal officials, including employees of federal agencies, Cabinet secretaries, and Members of Congress, constitute 35 percent of the witnesses before congressional committees. Congress has a responsibility to oversee the operations of the executive branch and therefore must hear testimony from relevant officials. Unfortunately, however, officials testifying on behalf of federal programs rarely offer a balanced assessment of their efforts. Prior to the 104th Congress, such oversight hearings, in Payne's words, were "almost always cheering sessions for the program involved."<sup>2</sup>  To its credit, the 104th Congress sought to correct this imbalance by inviting witnesses who opposed increased federal spending. Yet such testimony often faced sharp, coordinated opposition from the long-standing network of officials from federal agencies working in tandem with committee members who favored federal programs.
<p>
<li>With respect to the remaining 43 percent of witnesses, their exact financial relationship to the federal government is uncertain. Some are federal contractors, while many represent trade associations, businesses, or interest groups with significant economic interests in the outcome of pending congressional legislation. Others may not receive any federal funding. Even among this 43 percent, however, at least half testified in favor of more government spending or increased government power.
</ul>
<p>
<b>A QUESTION OF BALANCE</b>
<p>
<dd>
Witnesses favoring more expensive government outnumbered their opponents by a ratio of 4:1. This high percentage of government-dependent witnesses was recorded during the first session of the 104th Congress, a Congress which sought to cut taxes and rein in federal spending. This imbalance represents a pro-spending bias in the congressional hearing system. Congress should begin to address this bias by clarifying which witnesses receive federal funding and then by assembling more balanced panels of witnesses.
<p>
<dd>
Committee hearings can serve to educate the public by allowing a range of views to be presented and questioned. Indeed, congressional hearings often are the focus of national media reports. When these sessions are stacked in favor of continuing or expanding government programs, they give media access and prestige to those who believe that for every problem, there is a federal solution. Further, when the witnesses -- and Congress itself -- fail to reveal the self-interested nature of a spending advocate's testimony, they convey a misleading picture to the public.
<p>
<dd>
Consider, for example, the fight over funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Almost all of the witnesses at a February 29, 1996, House Commerce Committee hearing were financially dependent on federal tax dollars, and each predictably called for greater federal spending for public broadcasting: the presidents of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and National Public Radio and representatives from the Association of America's Public Television Stations, the National Federation of Community Broadcasters, the National Asian American Telecommunications Association, and the Children's Television Service.<sup>3</sup>  In 1995, as part of its campaign to preserve federal subsidies, PBS even sent Shari Lewis, puppeteer of Lamb Chop, to the National Press Club to protest possible budget cuts.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
<dd>Another of many such examples is a hearing on welfare reform held by the House Ways and Means Committee on February 2, 1995.<sup>5</sup>  Of the 65 witnesses who testified, 18 were from organizations that received federal grants, including five state and local officials who acknowledged that their agencies depend on federal funds. Apparently, none of the other 13 witnesses -- from groups such as the National Council of La Raza, the National Senior Citizens Law Center, the Service Employees International Union, the National Center for Family Literacy, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and Public Voice for Food and Health Policy -- thought that it relevant to mention their grants from the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Education, or the fact that their funding might have been in jeopardy. This scenario is repeated all too often, from Superfund reform to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, welfare reform, job training programs, and a host of other taxpayer-funded efforts.
<p>
<b>REFORMING THE CULTURE OF SPENDING</b>
<p>
<dd>
When seeking information about government programs or pending legislation, Members of Congress consult a variety of sources, including constituents, staff members, lobbyists, the news media, and the congressional leadership. But committee and subcommittee hearings provide Congressmen of both parties with what may be their clearest and most focused opportunity to gauge an issue by listening to often compelling testimony from private citizens, knowledgeable scholars, and program administrators. Hearings that are properly run can expose wasteful government activities or foster a national consensus on key issues. To fulfill these goals, however, Washington's culture of spending must be transformed. Congress could seek to control spending through small, targeted reforms. Foremost on any list of changes should be changes in the way congressional hearings are conducted to allow committee members to apprehend more readily the motivations of those who lobby in support of federal programs.
<p>
<dd>
The easiest reform to implement, requiring only a change in the House rules, is Truth in Testimony as introduced by Representative Doolittle. Truth in Testimony would require witnesses to disclose in their written statements any federal grants or contracts, including the amounts and sources of taxpayer funding, that they or their organization receive. If a witness declined to provide this information, his testimony would not appear in the official committee transcript. Because Congress does not currently require witnesses to reveal federal funding, most taxpayers (and perhaps many Members of Congress) are unaware that tax dollars subsidize lobbying activities. The legislative process would be significantly more open if the public knew whether a person testifying before Congress had a vested interest in the result.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
<dd>
Despite efforts by the 104th Congress to control spending and reform congressional procedures, this study demonstrates that the committee hearing process is still dominated by organizations and individuals that depend on federal funding, and thus have a direct interest in asking Congress for more money for the programs from which they receive grants. One of every three ostensibly "public" witnesses is a government grant recipient. As part of its oversight duty, Congress needs to hear from federal grantees, but 3,000 times each year may be too often. Congress needs to pay increased attention to the voice of the taxpayer, who often is not given the opportunity to counteract the claims and requests of federally funded groups. The truth in testimony proposal would do a great deal to ensure that hearings serve as an opportunity for Congress to gather objective information and not as a press conference on behalf of executive branch agencies, grant recipients, and professional lobbyists. Such a rule would allow Members of Congress to understand the background of witnesses' testimony. As part of the rules package for the 105th Congress, Congress therefore should adopt a Truth in Testimony rule.

<p>
<b>APPENDIX</b>
<p>
<dd>
The Heritage Foundation's Government Reform Project examined every hearing held during 1995 by 15 House and Senate committees and their subcommittees, encompassing 3,423 witnesses. Included in the survey were the House Science, Small Business, Banking, Veterans Affairs, Budget, and Transportation and Infrastructure Committees and the Senate Judiciary, Budget, Small Business, Indian Affairs, Energy and Natural Resources, Rules and Administration, Labor and Human Resources, Environment and Public Works, and Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committees. These committees were selected because complete witness lists were available via committee publications, committee web sites, and the <i>Congressional Record</i>. Because the Appropriations Committees were not included, it is probable that the results of this study slightly understate the actual percentage of witnesses who are depend directly on federal funding. This sample comprises approximately one-fourth of the approximately 13,000 witnesses that appear before Congress in a typical year. Only individuals who physically appeared at the hearing, as opposed to those who merely submitted statements, were included in the totals. Of the 3,423 witnesses catalogued, 1,189 worked for the federal government, 766 represented organizations that received federal grants, and 1,468 were from other organizations. Witnesses were identified as grant recipients by the Federal Assistance Awards Data System (FAADS) database covering the 1994 fiscal year.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
<dd>Congress passed the income tax deduction for charitable contributions in 1917, only four years after ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, which established the federal income tax. The purpose of the deduction then, as today, was to promote private donations to nonprofit institutions. Through the ups and downs of federal income tax rates, the deduction for charitable contributions has remained constant and unquestioned -- until now.
<p>
<dd>
With talk of overhauling the federal income tax in favor of a simple, consumption-based flat tax also has come talk of eliminating the charitable contribution deduction. This has raised considerable controversy. Many proponents of a flat income tax call for retaining the charitable deduction, but there are substantial reasons to eliminate the charitable deduction as part of any flat tax proposal. Contrary to popular opinion, the data suggest that giving to charities probably would increase with passage of a flat tax with no charitable deduction. The reason: The flat tax increases economic growth, personal income, savings, and net wealth, all of which lead to higher levels of giving. Specifically,
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Despite large variations in federal tax rates over the past two decades, donations as a percentage of personal income have remained constant.</b> Although the top marginal income tax rate has ranged from 28 to 91 percent over the past two decades, the amount that individuals donate to nonprofit organizations has remained relatively constant: around 1.83 percent of personal income. 
<p>
<li><b>The flat tax would increase personal income, leading in turn to increased donations.</b> Because the percentage of income donated to charities historically has been so constant, the surest way to increase charitable donations is to increase personal income. Put another way, even if the number of slices of the income pie donated to charity remains the same, a larger pie means larger slices.
<p>
<li><b>Several factors other than tax treatment determine how much individuals donate to charitable organizations.</b> Various surveys indicate that marital status, religious participation, and age all significantly affect the percentage of income an individual donates to charity. But these factors lie largely outside the income tax structure and therefore have little to do with whether the federal income tax is flat or not.
</ul>
<p>
<dd>
Retaining the charitable deduction as part of a flat tax carries with it several negative consequences, all of which hinder the underlying goal of a flat tax: to make the federal income tax system fairer and less intrusive by taxing all income only once and at its source, presumably at a low rate. Any proposed change should be measured against this standard. In particular, retaining the charitable deduction would have the following detrimental effects:
<p><ul>
<li><b> A higher tax rate.</b> Retaining the charitable contribution necessitates a higher tax rate that would be faced by all taxpayers, including those in lower income brackets.
<p>
<li><b>The possibility of other deductions.</b> The best excuse for any deduction is the previous one -- and the next one might well not be as admirable as the charitable deduction.
<p>
<li><b>Federal government social engineering.</b> The overriding problem with the current tax code is that it arbitrarily encourages certain behaviors and discourages others. Retaining any deductions under a flat tax regime, including the charitable contribution deduction, will continue this practice. Individuals should be free to chose how they spend their own hard-earned money.
</ul>
<p>
<dd>
Estimates by Heritage Foundation analysts indicate that aggregate contributions would increase slightly with passage of a flat tax even without a charitable contribution deduction. Certainly, some nonprofit organizations would benefit more than others; but, it can be presumed that religious congregations and human service charities would benefit most from a flat tax.
<p>
<dd>
In order to estimate the probable impact of a flat tax on charitable giving, it is necessary to examine three areas:
<p><ul>
<li><b>What</b> sorts of organizations make up the nonprofit sector,
<p>
<li><b>Who</b> makes up the donor population, and
<p>
<li><b>How</b> the nonprofit sector finances its activities.
</ul>
<p>
<b>DEFINING THE NONPROFIT SECTOR</b>
<p>
<dd>
Modern American society generally has organized its activities into two categories, the public and private sectors. The private sector, or market, includes businesses, corporations, and other entities motivated to earn a profit by selling a good or service. The public sector, or government, is meant to provide those services that are not produced by the market. Lester Salamon and Helmut Anheier describe this dual system in the following terms:
<p><blockquote >
	Despite the immense diversity of organizations that comprise modern society, we have come to accept the existence of two grand complexes of institutions -- two broad sectors -- into which it has become conventional to divide social life. We refer to these typically as the <i>market</i> and the <i>state</i>, or the <i>private</i> and the <i>public</i> sectors.<sup>2</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<dd>
This definition, however, overlooks a broad category of important organizations generically known as nonprofits. These organizations constitute what Salamon and Anheier term the "emerging sector."  The emerging or nonprofit sector employs more than 7 million people (or 5.7 percent of all employed workers) and constitutes roughly 6 percent of total annual output (roughly $350 billion). For comparison, the entire construction industry employs only about 5 million workers and represents 4 percent of total annual output.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Generally, nonprofit organizations are private entities whose purpose is to provide a service or good without profit as a primary motivation. While this definition may seem circular, it is the most basic description that applies to all nonprofit organizations. Nonprofits cannot really be classified as part of the market because, unlike private businesses, they do not have profit as their primary goal. Nor are they really a part of government because they cannot levy taxes to sponsor their activities. Within this general classification exists a great variety of organizations, from soup kitchens and homeless shelters, to art galleries and symphony orchestras, to political parties and campaigns. 
<p>
<dd>
Clearly, using this general definition, nonprofits have existed throughout American history. However, it was not until 1917 and passage of the charitable contribution deduction that the nonprofit sector obtained a second definition, this time a legal definition. Since the deduction was instituted, it has been necessary for the government to decide what organizations should be considered legally nonprofits, and therefore worthy of special treatment through the tax code, and which organizations and activities should not receive special treatment. What has emerged is a hodgepodge of organizations that may classify as a nonprofit in the general definition but be ineligible for favorable tax treatment because the federal government has determined that their activities are not of special value. For example, donations made to political campaigns (clearly nonprofit) are not tax-deductible, while donations to hospitals are (despite the multi-million-dollar salaries of some doctors). Unfortunately, most data collected on the nonprofit sector are organized according to the legal definition rather than the general one. Therefore, although this paper is concerned with charitable activity in general, it is limited in some senses to the legal definition of a nonprofit.
<p>
<dd>
The pattern of giving is such that religious organizations receive the highest percentage of donations: about 44 percent of total contributions in 1995. Education groups, primarily private colleges and universities, are the second-largest category, with 12.5 percent of total contributions in 1995.<sup>4</sup>  Other categories include health organizations, international support groups, environmental activist organizations, and the arts.
<p>
<dd>
Even within these broad categories, there is wide diversity. For example, the College Democrats, the University of Notre Dame, and Sidwell Friends Middle School are all categorized as "educational organizations."  Similarly, the Heritage Foundation and the Brookings Institution are both classified as educational organizations and yet are very different in outlook, structure, focus, and membership. To speak of "the nonprofits" as if they somehow constituted a single entity is therefore misleading. 
<p>
<dd>
Despite this diversity, most Americans continue to think of nonprofit groups exclusively as charitable organizations whose aim is to help the disadvantaged even though "human service/welfare" nonprofits -- those which do fit this widely held definition -- received only 8.1 percent of all charitable contributions in 1995. The diversity of the nonprofit sector also is overlooked by many analysts who argue that as the federal welfare system is dismantled, nonprofits will have to "pick up the slack" in helping cure social ills. The question asked by Rev. Fred Kammer, president of Catholic Charities, USA, is typical: "Where will the money come from to save those people from starvation, illness, or death?"<sup>5</sup>  These are valid concerns, but they are overstated with regard to elimination of the charitable contribution deduction, which affects giving to all nonprofits, not just human service organization.
<p>
<b>The Importance of Religious Organizations</b>
<p>
<dd>
Another factor often overlooked by analysts is the role that religious organizations play in providing basic charity to disadvantaged groups. Most surveys determine how much money is donated to religious organizations but not how this money is used. Because donations to religious organizations represent about 44 percent of all donations, this is a very important consideration.
<p>
<dd>
A full 91.7 percent of religious congregations in America sponsor human service/welfare programs through the donations they receive. These activities range from youth groups (72.6 percent of religious congregations engage in this activity) and food kitchens (50.1 percent participation) to family and marriage counseling (62 percent participation).<sup>6</sup>  In 1991, religious congregations donated a total of $28 billion to other charitable activities, including $11 billion in volunteer time. The $17 billion in direct expenditures represented 31 percent of the total donated to religious congregations in that year. In other words, nearly one-third of the money donated to religious congregations is spent on charitable activities other than religious functions.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<dd>
As will be demonstrated below, donations made to religious congregations will likely increase with passage of a flat tax. The activities which these congregations sponsor, therefore, will see a corresponding increase in funding. It is important to consider the activities of religious congregations when researching human service nonprofits. 
<p>
<b>DEFINING THE CONTRIBUTORS</b>
<p>
<dd>
Nonprofit organizations receive operating income from a variety of sources. In fact, only 10.1 percent of revenues for all nonprofits come from contributions. The other 89.9 percent is received from program service revenues (71.7 percent), government grants (7.9 percent), and other sources (10.3 percent).<sup>8</sup>  The nature of an individual nonprofit largely determines its primary source of income. For example, hospitals and nursing homes, although they are nonprofits, have services they can price and sell. These groups rely heavily on entrance fees and ticket sales. Homeless and poverty shelters, on the other hand, do not have a good market because their "customers" are unable to purchase their services. These organizations therefore must rely more heavily on charitable donations.
<p>
<dd>
Concentrating on private donations alone demonstrates another layer of diversity. There are four major donor categories: individuals, foundations, corporations, and bequests. Each has unique characteristics that determine, in general, which charities are supported and at what level. As <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1093c4.gif">Chart 4</a> shows, individuals contribute the vast majority of dollars (a full 81 percent in 1994), with corporate, foundation, and bequest giving making up the remaining 19 percent (approximately 4.7, 7.6, and 6.7 percent, respectively, in 1994). 
<p>
<blockquote>
<dd>
<b>Individuals.</b> Individual donations accounted for $116.23 billion worth of private contributions in 1995.<sup>9</sup>  By far the largest category, it also is the most diverse. Individual donors range from the poor who give change to their churches to the rich who donate millions each year to universities or art museums. In order to understand how the flat tax without a charitable donation deduction will effect individuals, it is necessary to identify which groups donate to what charities, why they contribute, and what characteristics determine the amounts individuals donate to nonprofits.
<p>
<dd>
The American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel (AAFRC) Trust for Philanthropy reports that total individual donations have remained relatively constant since 1974, averaging 1.83 percent of total personal income. The lowest level was in 1985 (1.71 percent of total personal income); the highest, in 1989 (1.95 percent).<sup>10</sup>  Despite the relative consistency of aggregate individual donations over time, many factors, including the tax code, influence how much an individual donates, the sorts of nonprofits that receive support, and the types of donations that are made.
<p>
<dd>
<b >Foundations.</b> Foundations accounted for $10.44 billion in donations during 1995.<sup>11</sup>  There are more than 38,000 charitable foundations in the United States, most of them small foundations established by individuals. But it is the 775 largest foundations that control 65 percent of total foundation assets and award nearly half of the country's foundation grants.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Foundations exist for many reasons. One of the primary reasons is to avoid paying taxes. For example, many foundations are established upon an individual's death to avoid paying the estate tax, which can be as high as 55 percent of the transfer amount. Another example is the provision passed in 1984 which allows tax-free donations of equities (at present market value) to charitable foundations. With this in mind, wealthy individuals can establish and donate stock holdings to the foundation. They may then claim a tax deduction and retain control over the ultimate destination of the donation.
<p>
<dd>
But there are other reasons foundations exist. They may be a convenient way for many individual donors to pool their gifts and fund projects that would not be possible at the individual level -- as is the case with community foundations. Or individuals may establish foundations with specific instructions as to which causes the money will be donated upon their death. Thus the individual creates a legacy of support for causes that are of importance to him. Quite simply, an individual may create a foundation to separate himself from the day-to-day decisions of making donations, entrusting those responsibilities to a board of trustees instructed by general guidelines on how the money is to be distributed. These considerations may be made in addition to tax considerations, but are largely independent of such financial concerns and would likely remain important even after significant tax reform.
<p>
<dd>
<b>Corporations.</b> Corporations accounted for some $7.4 billion in contributions in 1995.<sup>13</sup>  There are many reasons why corporations donate to charitable causes. General goodwill among the corporate executives and tax considerations are two. However, public image and profitability, the main responsibilities of private firms, also are important. Surveys have shown that consumers consider a company's public image in deciding whether to purchase its goods or services. Firms realize this and often take an active role in their local community to promote themselves as good corporate citizens. Many companies also have found charitable causes to be a good source of advertisement or marketing. For example, computer companies will donate products to universities knowing that students, being familiar with the product, likely will purchase that same brand once they have left school. Finally, many companies promote volunteer activities among their employees because such service is believed to improve employee morale and attract more productive workers.
<p>
<dd><b>Bequests.</b> Donations made by bequest accounted for $9.77 billion in charitable giving in 1995.<sup>14</sup>  Bequest, or willed, giving is becoming an increasingly important source of donations for nonprofits because the workers of the 1950s and 1960s, who benefited from a rapidly growing economy and were able to accumulate significant wealth, are beginning to reach old age. This generation will be followed by the baby boomer generation. The wealth of the former and large volume of the latter ensure that willed giving will remain a growing source of support.

<b>Factors Affecting Individual Gifts</b><sup>15</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Several factors influence the percentage of income an individual donates to charity. The level of income itself is important insofar as the dollar amount donated is concerned. However, there is no constant relationship between income and donations as a percentage of income. For example, donors earning less than $20,000 give more to nonprofits as a percentage of income than those earning between $50,000 and $100,000.<sup>16</sup>  The average donor earning less than $10,000 in 1994 gave just over $200 to charitable organizations, or 2.7 percent of income; donors earning between $40,000 and $50,000 gave approximately $575, or only 1.3 percent of income.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Income level also directly influences the type of organization to which an individual donates. Upper-income individuals are more likely to give to the arts and humanities, environmental causes, and educational institutions. Lower-income individuals tend to give to religious congregations and human service groups. In 1993, the average income for donors to the arts and humanities was $56,535; the average for donors to environmental causes was $50,922; and the average for donors to educational institutions was $50,527. On the other end of the spectrum, the average income of donors to religious organizations was $40,923, and the average for donors to human service organizations was $47,099.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Put another way, an individual donor earning over $60,000 per year is seven times more likely to contribute to the arts and humanities than a donor earning less than $20,000 per year; donations to educational institutions are 4.3 times more likely to come from wealthier individuals; and wealthier individuals are 3.7 times more likely to donate to environmental causes. On the other hand, wealthy donors (again, those earning more than $60,000 per year) are only 1.5 times more likely to donate to religious organizations and only 2.9 times more likely to donate to human service organizations.
<p>
<dd>
These differences are significant when considering changes in the tax code. Independent Sector, a national coalition of voluntary organizations, foundations, and corporate giving programs which encourages philanthropy and nonprofit initiatives, estimates that 65.3 percent of donors to the arts and humanities plan to itemize. Only 44.4 percent of donors to human services are itemizers, and only 38.1 percent of those who donate to religious organizations find it advantageous to itemize on their federal income tax returns.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Several demographic factors influence the amount of income an individual donates to charity, regardless of income level. The most important are age, marital status, and church participation. In general, older individuals who have been married and who attend church regularly tend to donate a larger percentage of their income to charitable organizations than do young, single, non-church attending individuals. Specifically, retirees (individuals over the age of 65) give about 3.4 percent of their income to nonprofits. Those below the age of 45 give an average of about 1.6 percent of their income to charity. Likewise, those who are married or who have been married in the past donate about twice as much on average (as a percentage of income) as do single individuals.<sup>20</sup> 
<p>
<dd>
Perhaps the single most important indicator in determining an individual's level of charitable giving (to all charitable causes, not just religious congregations) is church attendance. In 1994, donors who attended church gave an average of 2.2 percent of their income to charity; those who did not attend church averaged only 1.4 percent. With specific reference to the frequency of church attendance, again in 1994, donors who attended church services weekly donated an average of 3.3 percent of their income to nonprofits; those who attended monthly averaged 1.4 percent; and those who attended only once or twice a year averaged only 1 percent.<sup>21</sup>
<p>
<dd>
There are two major conclusions to be drawn from any study of the donor community. First, individuals constitute by far the largest source of donations, contributing nearly 81 percent of all donations. Second, upper-income individuals (those most likely to itemize and therefore to be directly affected by elimination of the charitable contribution deduction) give primarily to the arts, hospitals, and universities. The majority of non-itemizers give to churches and human service organizations. These individuals, by and large, would not be affected negatively by the elimination of the charitable contribution deduction.
<p>
<b>EFFECT OF ELIMINATING THE CHARITABLE DEDUCTION WITH A FLAT TAX</b>
<p>
<dd>
The nonprofit sector is a heterogeneous collection of organizations with various revenue sources (from product sales to contributions) and a wide range of donors (from multibillion-dollar corporations to relatively unaffluent individuals) providing various services (from opera to soup kitchens). Therefore, it is impossible to determine how each and every nonprofit would fare under a flat tax without a charitable contribution deduction. Several important economic patterns and incentives must be considered in trying to anticipate the aggregate impact a flat tax would have on the nonprofit sector.
<p>
<dd>
It is important to consider all of the facts when determining the effect a flat tax will have on charitable donations. All too often, analysts and other interested parties focus on one or two aspects of the current tax code or donating public but ignore the fundamental changes a flat tax will have on taxpayers. These analysts are working "within the box" of the current system. But the flat tax represents such a fundamental shift in American life that it is necessary to step away from the box and take a new approach that evaluates all the important considerations.
<p>
<dd>
Heritage scholars have taken such a complete, "outside-the-box" approach and determined that aggregate charitable donations actually will increase under a flat tax. Before describing these results, however, it is important to understand some of the misunderstandings that cause some analysts to conclude that eliminating the charitable deduction must lead to a fall in donations.
<p><blockquote>
<b>1)  The price of giving is not the only factor.</b> Many analysts believe that elimination of the charitable tax deduction would decrease significantly the amount of money donated to nonprofits. However, this is based on the mistaken assumption that the primary driving force behind charitable donations is the income tax deduction. In other words, these analysts believe that individuals donate a certain amount of money almost solely because there is a benefit to be had through the federal tax code. If an individual faces a tax rate of 28 percent, giving a dollar to charity actually costs him only 72 cents because he will save 28 cents in taxes; and as this benefit decreases in value (as happened in 1980 and 1986 with the lowering of tax rates), the "price" of giving goes up and, it is argued, donations can be expected to decrease.
<p>
<dd>
This argument describes the price effect of the charitable deduction. But focusing on this price effect to the exclusion of all other factors is like saying that the only reason people purchase a house is to take advantage of the home mortgage income tax deduction. While tax incentives are part of the giving equation, the price-effect position ignores the fact that making charitable donations or buying a home still has a real cost. Making a contribution to charity is foregone income or wealth, whether it costs the donor 72 cents, a dollar, or any amount in between.
<p>
<dd>
Several other factors are more important than deductibility in determining the level of charitable giving. As mentioned above, church attendance, marital status, and age all make more of a difference in the decision to give and the amount given to charity than the presence of an income tax deduction. If the deduction were the most important determinant, one would expect that individuals with a certain income who itemize, regardless of church attendance, marital status, or location, would contribute about as much as non-itemizers with the same income. However, this is not the case. In fact, many non-itemizers who are weekly church attendees donate more than those with similar incomes who itemize and do not attend church services on a regular basis.
<p>
<dd>
But even limiting ourselves to tax code variables that affect charitable donations, the price effect ignores two important points: 
<p>
<dd>
<b>First, there is the income effect:</b> the economic effect that as an individual's income increases, he is able to afford more of a specific good without changing the relative amount of income donated. In the case of charitable donations, this principle means that an individual is able to make more donations in absolute terms without increasing the percentage of income being donated. The size of the pie has increased, and although the number of slices remains the same, each slice is larger.
<p>
<dd>
Second, some 46 million American households give to charities but do not claim an income tax deduction. Non-itemizers account for roughly 64 percent of all donors.<sup>22</sup>  Because these donors do not itemize, they do not face the price effect; it costs them as much to give an additional dollar as it does to use the money in some other way. They do face the income effect, however. Therefore, any plan which simultaneously increases income and reduces or eliminates the price incentive can be expected to increase aggregate giving only if the income effect is larger than the price effect, keeping in mind that more donors are influenced by the income effect than by the price.
<p>
<dd>
Taking these two points into consideration, Heritage analysts estimate that the amount of money donated to charities each year under the flat tax would be about 3.8 percent more than would have been donated under the current system.<sup>23</sup>  This figure assumes both the elimination of the charitable contribution deduction, which increases the "cost" of donating (but only for itemizers), and the increased income that is projected to flow to all individuals, regardless of itemizer status, because of more rapid economic growth projected under the flat tax. In other words, the income effect overwhelms the price change.
<p>
<b>2)  Giving has remained remarkably stable over time despite changes in the tax code.</b> Although the tax code has changed dramatically over the past 70 years, the level of charitable giving as a percentage of income and economic output has remained relatively constant. Giving as a percentage of personal income has hovered around 1.8 percent. Moreover, charitable giving from all sources has averaged 1.94 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) per year over the past 30 years, during which the rate has neither dropped below 1.72 percent of GDP (in 1978) nor risen above 2.14 percent of GDP (in 1969).<sup>24</sup>  This narrow range has persisted despite a top marginal tax rate fluctuating between 28 and 91 percent.
<p>
<dd>
Moreover, despite changes in the tax code which have shifted the tax burden from the corporate sector to individuals and back again, and despite the creation and elimination of various tax loopholes and incentives, the levels of charitable donations from each of the four main sources also have remained relatively constant over time.
<p>
<dd><b>Example No. 1: The 1981 rate cuts.</b> On several occasions, analysts have predicted particularly dire consequences for charitable giving because of major changes in the tax code. In 1981, for example, Ronald Reagan's first economic plan became law, dramatically reducing marginal tax rates. The plan included an across-the-board reduction of 25 percent in marginal tax rates for individuals and a reduction in the highest individual rate from 70 percent to 50 percent. Many analysts and most directors of nonprofit organizations feared a significant decrease in charitable donations.
<p>
<dd>
These fears were never realized. By 1986, when President Reagan's economic plan was fully in effect, total charitable giving was 16 percent higher (accounting for inflation) than in 1980. The economic growth that resulted from reducing marginal tax rates actually boosted the amount of charitable donations. Moreover, total giving accounted for 1.9 percent of GDP in 1986 compared with only 1.7 percent in 1980.<sup>25</sup>  Between 1980 and 1986, the amounts contributed by donors in every category (individuals, corporations, foundations, and bequests) increased, as did the levels of contributions received by nonprofits in every category (from the arts to human service organizations). And these increases occurred despite the harsh recession of 1981-1982.
<p>
<dd>
<b>Example No. 2: The 1986 tax reform.</b> Another case study of the effect the tax code has on charitable deductions is the 1986 tax bill. That bill eliminated numerous deductions in the federal income tax code and lowered the top individual marginal tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent. The bill also eliminated the "above-the-line" tax deductibility of charitable contributions by which, prior to 1986, all taxpayers, whether they itemized or not, could deduct charitable contributions from taxable income.
<p>
<dd>
As in the early 1980s, many analysts predicted a dramatic reduction in the amount of money donated to charitable organizations because of the lower marginal rates and the elimination of the above-the-line deduction. For example, <i>Philanthropy Monthly</i> published an article citing an Independent Sector report that charitable giving would decline by $8 billion because of the 1986 tax bill.<sup>26</sup>  However, charitable donations for 1987 totaled $90.3 billion, a 7.6 percent increase over 1986, and total giving in 1986 amounted to $83.9 billion, a 15 percent increase over 1985. In fact, total charitable donations increased (in inflation-adjusted terms) every year between 1983 and 1989.<sup>27</sup>  Far from the bleak outcome predicted by analysts, charitable contributions actually increased after enactment of the 1986 tax bill -- again, as a result of strong economic growth.
<p>
<b>3)  Not all charitable organizations would be affected equally.</b> While the aggregate level of giving is projected to increase under the flat tax, the change would affect different nonprofits in different ways. The degree to which a particular nonprofit shares in the benefits of the flat tax would depend on what service it provides and who its donors are.
<p>
<dd>
Human service/welfare organizations and religious congregations generally could expect to benefit the most from passage of the flat tax, primarily for two reasons. One is that individuals tend to see such donations as a basic obligation rather than as discretionary. The other reason is that the majority of donors to these activities are nonitemizers who would not be affected or dissuaded by the elimination of the charitable deduction but would be induced to give more thanks to increased after-tax income.
<p>
<dd>
Of all nonprofits, religious congregations have experienced the most constant support over time. They also enjoy the broadest base of support across all income brackets. Therefore, it can be expected that instead of being hurt by elimination of the charitable deduction, religious congregations will be helped significantly from increased income following from faster economic growth. In addition, 92 percent of religious congregations across the nation are engaged in social activities; in 1991, $2.4 billion was spent by religious congregations on human service projects. This form of social welfare thus would likely enjoy a significant increase in funding as a result of the flat tax.
<p>
<dd>
The effect on other nonprofits, such as universities, art and theater companies, and environmental groups, which are most dependent on donations from the wealthy, is unclear. On the one hand, it is primarily the wealthy who take advantage of the charitable deduction. Donations may decrease for this reason. On the other hand, elimination of the capital gains and estate taxes would allow wealthy individuals to donate more money during their working years rather than setting the money aside in a bequest or foundation. Donations might increase for this reason. In the long run, increased income as a result of lower taxes and increased economic growth will likely mean more donations for all non-profits, the arts, environment, and universities included.
<p>
<dd>
However, because after-tax personal income for all taxpayers would increase with a flat tax, those individuals who continue to donate would have more money to give. Moreover, the loss of charitable donations means only that nonprofits will be forced to innovate and raise money through new channels. This may include increasing entrance fees, designing new products (such as symphony recordings) for sale to the public, or refocusing fundraising activities. Again, one of the primary benefits of the flat tax is that it removes special treatments from the tax code. Thus, nonprofits will have to innovate for funds just as private firms are expected to react to changes in the economic environment.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</b>
<p>
<dd>
Although aggregate giving would increase with passage of a flat tax, many questions surrounding elimination of the charitable deduction remain, both because the nonprofit sector is so diverse and because the deduction has become so ingrained in the federal income tax code and in the minds and emotions of so many donors. For example, what about giving from non-individuals such as companies and foundations?  Why endure the political pain to maintain just this one deduction?  Why elimination and not some alternative?
<p><blockquote>
<b>Why not keep just the deduction for charitable contributions? </b>
<p>
<dd>
One of the most important features of the flat tax is that it does not favor one activity over another. No one action is treated "better" under a flat tax than any other. Including the charitable deduction would violate this important feature. "As long as people make gifts, even to worthy causes, primarily because they are tax deductible and not because that cause is passionately important to them," writes <i>World Magazine</i> publisher Joel Belz, "both the tax code and the government behind it are way too important. Yes, we may lose a few gifts to our charitable organizations -- but in the end, both we and they will breathe so much more deeply of the great air of freedom that it will be a good trade."<sup>28</sup>  Including any deductions, even the deduction for charitable contributions, in a flat tax plan breaches the equality principle and opens the door for increased government activism. The federal tax code should be used to raise money, not influence behavior.
<p>
<dd>
Also, the best excuse for the next income tax deduction is the last one. Once the door is open for some special interest, as important as that interest may be, other interest groups will be knocking at the door for their own income tax deduction.
<p>
<dd>
Finally, retaining the deduction for charitable contributions, as with any other deduction, would necessitate a higher flat tax rate to raise the same amount of revenue as a pure flat tax. Assuming a revenue neutral flat tax is passed, including the charitable deduction would require a rate that is 0.8 percentage points higher than otherwise would be necessary without the deduction. This would hurt disproportionately those people who do not find it advantageous to claim the charitable contribution deduction, forcing them to pay higher taxes to subsidize those who are able to take the deduction. Lower-income individuals, in other words, would wind up subsidizing the activities of wealthier individuals.
<p>
<b>What about charitable bequests and elimination of the estate tax? </b>
<p>
<dd>
Many analysts believe that individuals no longer would have an incentive to leave money to charities if such donations were no longer tax-deductible. Instead, the argument goes, people would leave all of their money to their children or other non-charitable causes, and nonprofits will lose a valuable source of revenue.
<p>
<dd>
This view overlooks several important points. One is that only a small fraction of charitable contributions (6.7 percent) results from bequests. Even a drastic reduction of 30 percent in bequest giving would reduce overall giving by only 2 percent. The increased economic growth likely under a flat tax would more than make up for this shortfall.
<p>
<dd>
Economic theory traditionally has suggested two ways of looking at how households decide what to do with lifetime savings and bequests. The life cycle hypothesis, first advanced by MIT Nobel Laureate Franco Modigliani, maintains that households act to accumulate savings which they plan to exhaust in their own lifetimes. At the end of their lives, a "residual" sum may be left which can be willed to either children, charities, or others depending on the cost of leaving money to these various individuals or groups. The current tax on bequests to persons and institutions other than nonprofits acts to encourage giving to charities and to discourage bequests to relatives, according to this theory. Thus, eliminating the estate tax would decrease the amount bequeathed to charities.
<p>
<dd>
The other major approach to analyzing household behavior is the permanent income or overlapping generations theory, commonly credited to University of Chicago Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman. This theory maintains that households do not plan to consume all of their personal savings during their own lifetimes; instead, they expect to pass some savings on to their children so they may enjoy an adequate level of income, and only what is left over after this paternal bequest can be considered a "residual" and used to support charities. Under this theory, the current tax on bequests to family members serves to reduce contributions to charitable organizations. Thus, eliminating the estate tax will increase the residual available for charitable bequests.
<p>
<dd>
In the last 15 years, professional economic research has tended overwhelmingly to verify that the permanent income/overlapping generations motive has dominated household saving and bequest behavior in the United States.<sup>29</sup>  Therefore, any public policy that increases the amount of savings available to households will increase the "residual" left to charitable organizations as well. The flat tax, accompanied by elimination of the charitable contribution deduction and estate tax, would do just that.
<p>
<b>What about grants from charitable foundations?</b>
<p>
<dd>
As mentioned above, foundations exist for many reasons. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the effect a flat tax will have on any individual foundation or on the decision of a particular individual to create a foundation. It is possible, however, to make some generalizations.
<p>
<dd>
First, many foundations are created for reasons wholly outside the tax code. They may be a more convenient way for many individual donors to pool their gifts and fund projects, as is the case with community foundations. Or individuals may establish a foundation to remove themselves from the day-to-day operation of charitable activities. Whatever these non-tax reasons may be -- and they are as unique as foundations themselves -- a change in the federal income tax code would have little impact on their existence and activities.
<p>
<dd>
The second reason for the existence of foundations is to gain a tax advantage. For example, the Tax Reform Act of 1984 made equities donated to foundations tax deductible at their present market value. Thus individuals can create a foundation, donate equities, and receive a tax benefit while retaining control over the ultimate destination of the donations. Other tax incentives include avoiding the estate tax or significant capital gains taxes. It is quite accurate to believe that the flat tax would have a significant impact on the structure of foundations from this tax perspective. However, the exact and total effect is not clear. For example, removal of the estate tax likely would increase donations while elimination of the 1984 law likely would work in the opposite direction. Furthermore, even if a flat tax were to remove one reason for the creation of a foundation by an individual, it does not follow that the total contributions by the individual would decline. With fewer tax considerations to take into account, the individual might simply make larger contributions directly to organizations during his or her working life.
<p>
<dd>
To the extent that existing foundations might be affected by a flat tax, the primary concern would be whether the legislation contained "fine print" to ensure fair treatment. For example, the excise tax that foundations currently pay on investment income should be reclassified for what it really is: a capital gains tax. This tax would be eliminated with the passage of a flat tax. 
<p>
<b>What would happen to corporate giving? </b>
<p>
<dd>
There is no reason to believe that corporate giving would decrease with passage of a flat tax. While there are many reasons why corporations make donations, the overriding reason is to assist the company in making money for their employees and stockholders. The primary reason that corporations donate to charity and support charitable causes, therefore, is to increase their image within the community. Alternatively, corporations engage in quasi-charitable activities that offer a "community-friendly" venue for advertisements: sponsoring a community parade, for example, or donating goods and services to local schools or active community groups. Finally, corporations may make donations because it is an opportunity to increase the image of their products. That companies offer computers to universities is a good example of this last point. These incentives to engage in charitable activity will not disappear with passage of the flat tax.
<p>
<dd>
In fact, it is likely that charitable contributions from corporations would increase as corporate profits increase under the flat tax. Noted Harvard economist Dale Jorgensen has estimated that general economic activity would increase by 9 percent with passage of the flat tax.<sup>30</sup>  As the general economy grows and corporate profits increase, companies will have larger budgets; thus, even the same percentage of giving would yield increased amounts of charitable contributions.
<p>
<b>Are there any alternatives to the charitable contribution deduction that would be compatible with a flat tax?</b>
<p>
<dd>
There are several alternatives to outright elimination of the charitable contribution deduction. Each one is better than maintaining the full deduction with a flat tax, but each one also has significant drawbacks.
<p>
<dd>
Senator Dan Coats (R-IN) and other lawmakers have put forth the idea of a dollar-per-dollar tax credit for charitable donations of up to $500 for individual taxpayers ($1,000 for married persons filing jointly). The credit would be limited to contributions to human service charities. Taxpayers would have to forego the $500 but could either donate the money to a private charity and take the tax credit or simply pay the taxes, in which case the money would be spent by the federal government. In effect, taxpayers could "vote" on whether private social welfare organizations or the federal government should spend $500 of the money they currently pay in taxes.
<p>
<dd>
Senator Coats has proposed this approach within the context of the current tax code. The credit would supersede the present deduction, which would be available only for contributions made above and beyond the $500 ceiling ($1,000 for married persons filing jointly). However, the $500 charitable credit could be joined with the flat tax in place of the deduction. This would be superior to maintaining the deduction but would still have several drawbacks. For example, the credit would infringe on the integrity of a pure flat tax. Any deduction, credit, or other loophole would open the door for future deductions, credits, or loopholes.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Also, unless the $500 credit was offset by equal reductions in federal welfare spending, a higher tax rate would be necessary. Such a spending reduction mechanism is not included in Senator Coats's proposal.
<p>
<dd>
Another idea is to limit the income tax deduction to contributions made to human service organizations. This proposal, which is included in the Coats legislation, would have the advantage of focusing donations where they are most needed: on the sorts of private "welfare-oriented" efforts that many expect will "pick up the slack" as federal welfare programs are streamlined. At the same time, a targeted tax deduction would eliminate the subsidy by all taxpayers of activities, such as the arts and private universities, that are enjoyed primarily by the wealthy.
<p>
<dd>
There are, however, several drawbacks to a targeted deduction. It would require a higher tax rate, although not as high as would be required if the full deduction were retained. All taxpayers would face a higher tax burden, with only a portion of taxpayers receiving a reduction in return. Maintaining any charitable deduction may also lead to other exemptions and loopholes. Once again, including any deduction, even the deduction for charitable contributions, conflicts with the flat tax principle of fairness and opens the door for increased government activism, perhaps not in such a desirable direction. Finally, there would have to another layer of complex regulations to differentiate between "human service" organizations and other charitable activities.
</blockquote><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
<dd>
Any public policy must have a clearly defined goal. The task then becomes one of reaching that goal most efficiently and completely. In the case of the charitable contribution deduction, the goal is to encourage private giving to private organizations engaged in socially beneficial activities. It is unclear, however, that the current tax structure with a charitable contribution deduction is the most efficient way to reach that goal. Far more effective would be a flat income tax with a single low rate and no deductions. Historical evidence and statistical analysis demonstrate that giving to nonprofit organizations will not decline with passage of the flat tax. In fact, donations likely will increase slightly because of higher economic growth.
<p>
<dd>
The flat tax, by increasing economic growth and removing 24 million Americans from the federal income tax rolls, itself serves as a charitable program. All Americans, especially those at lower income levels, will realize more economic opportunities and lower taxes. The flat tax will give individuals the freedom to make their own decisions on how to spend their own money without fear of being penalized through the federal income tax structure. These benefits will do more for individual Americans than any nonprofit organization -- and certainly more than any federal government program -- ever can.
<p>
<b>TECHNICAL APPENDIX</b>
<p>
<dd>
Heritage analysts estimate that the amount of money donated to charities each year under the flat tax would be about 3.8 percent more than would have been donated under the current system. This figure assumes the following:
<p><ul>
<li>A final flat income tax rate of 17 percent.
<p>
<li>
An immediate and lasting increase in after-tax personal income of 2.3 percent. This is a static estimate based on the Internal Revenue Service public use tape from tax year 1992 (the latest year for which data were available) and does not include any increased income that may arise as the result of higher economic growth under the flat tax.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<li>
An additional increase in economic output of 9 percent annually after a two-year transition period. This is taken from testimony delivered by Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson, who estimated the effect of moving from the current income tax system to a consumption-based system.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
<li>
A price elasticity of -0.44 and an income elasticity of +1.00. The price elasticity is an average of the price elasticities found in time series and panel data studies cited in the work of Richard Steinberg, Associate Professor of Economics at Indiana University. The 11 studies cited by Steinberg generated an average fall in contributions of 0.44 percent for every 1 percent increase in the "tax price" of giving faced by individuals.<sup>34</sup>  The income elasticity was derived from historic data across the income spectrum indicating that as income increases by 1 percent, charitable donations also increase by 1 percent.<sup>35</sup>
</ul>
<p>
<dd>
An important feature of this estimate is that, unlike other work, it takes into account the use of the charitable contribution deduction for purposes of fraudulent tax evasion. For example, economist Joel Slemrod, Professor of Business Economics and Public Policy at the University of Michigan Business School, has reported that approximately 7.2 percent of reported donations in one large sample were found to be false following intensive auditing by the Internal Revenue Service.<sup>36</sup>  The IRS data on itemized contributions are modified to reflect this finding.
<p>
<dd>
Econometric studies based on a single time period were excluded from this analysis. There is a growing professional consensus that such cross-sectional studies (which examine differences in giving between individuals in a single time period) are characterized by a number of fundamental methodological flaws.
<p>
<dd>
First, the suitability of these studies, which rely on evidence from a static snapshot of the economy at a single point in time, for examining the dynamic effect of changes in taxes and income on charitable contributions over a number of time periods is dubious. Time series and panel data studies examine the effect of taxes and income on giving over a number of successive time periods and hence appear more suitable in this respect.
<p>
<dd>
Second, cross-sectional econometric studies fall victim to the problem of multi-colinearity. Econometric regressions can separate out the individual effects of changes in tax rates and income on giving only when there are independent variations in these two variables. In a single year, the tax price (income tax rate) of giving faced by an individual is determined solely by his or her income and hence does not vary independently.<sup>37</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Given these problems, the emerging consensus of a decade ago that changes in tax policies have significant effects on giving has been shattered. This consensus was based almost wholly on static cross-sectional (and therefore flawed) studies. Much of the new dynamic econometric evidence suggests that the link between the level of giving and tax incentives is highly questionable at best.

<li>    Many fundraisers and analysts are concerned with the effect a flat tax will have on donations from the "super rich" because these donations tend to provide the "marginal" income for some nonprofits. In other words, numerous donations from small donors constitute a relatively stable source of income. Fundraisers therefore concentrate their efforts on attracting one or two big donations from wealthy donors. As important as these marginal donations are, they are not the main subject of this paper; this paper addresses charitable giving in general. Donations from the wealthy and foundations (usually established by wealthy individuals) will be addressed in a forthcoming study.

<li>    It might be possible to remove the "welfare-voting" proposal from the income tax structure altogether by creating a system whereby taxpayers choose private charities to which they want a set donation made. This would retain the simplicity of the flat tax and also allow a partial privatization of welfare spending. However, there are several drawbacks, the most significant of which is the tremendous bureaucracy and administrative costs associated with such a plan.

</ol>

<a name="1">
1) CBS reporter Rita Braver doesn't want anyone to think
Republicans aren't just as guilty as Democrats when it come to
fundraising. On Sunday's Face the Nation (December 15), Braver
filled in for Bob Schieffer.
<BR>
<DD>
    Braver asked Gloria Borger of U.S. News & World Report: "We
counted this week, there are eleven different congressional
committees looking at Democratic fundraising, that's not to say
the Republicans don't have some problems, but that sounds like
it's going to be a pretty serious, time consuming issue."
<BR>
<DD>
    Borger responded by noting that "Today, on the front page of
The Washington Post, is a story about how the White House, as one
person said, has essentially become a Motel 6, renting out the
Lincoln Bedroom, giving it to people who are big contributors to
the party. This doesn't look good."
<BR>
<DD>
    Braver countered: "Is this any different than what happened,
because it seemed to me that I would over the years in Washington
run into some big, when Republicans were President, contributor
who'd say 'oh yeah, we spent the last night in the Lincoln
Bedroom.'"
<BR>
<DD>
    Borger disagreed with Braver's "everybody does it" line: "I
think it's more frequent though, I really do."
<P>
<a name="2">
2) Speaking of Sunday's Washington Post story, it didn't
exactly generate a lot of television news. The front page Post
story detailed how major contributors to the Democratic National
Committee are thanked with an overnight stay in the White House:
"The White House refuses to release guest lists, but three weeks
of logs turned over to Congress suggest the guest quarters were
in regular use." The Post story asserted: "So many big-money
donors have slept at the White House in recent years that one
Clinton fundraiser likens the executive mansion to a Motel 6."
<BR>
<DD>
Football killed NBC Nightly News in Washington, but neither
ABC's World News Sunday nor the CBS Evening News mentioned a word
December 15. Rita Braver filed a piece on the Chinese finding a
downed American plane from WWII. And CBS found time for a long
story from Jacqueline Adams on the discovery of a gene in the
fruit fly that controls sex and when altered causes male flies to
become bi-sexual.
<P>
<a name="3">
3) ABC, CBS and CNN fought to land top Clinton aide George
Stephanopoulos, but ABC News won the battle. The just-departed
Senior Adviser to the President will have a far greater role at
ABC than Bill Kristol, the former chief of staff for Vice
President Dan Quayle. While the Clintonite will spar with
conservative Kristol in discussions on This Week and Good Morning
America, The New York Times noted he also "is expected to do some
reporting as a correspondent." He'll produce longer pieces for GMA. 
<BR>
<DD>
How far were the other networks willing to go? As with ABC,
well beyond any position offered to former Reagan or Bush
administration political operatives. "A CNN source said
yesterday," The Washington Post's John Carmody reported December
12, "the cable network had been prepared to offer Stephanopoulos
his own weekend half-hour program and some other 'innovative
programming ideas.'" CBS News proposed a slot on Face the Nation
and a role in its upcoming Eye on People cable channel.
Carmody noted that ABC hopes "that if things go well,
Stephanopoulos's role can be expanded to include doing some
full-length programming for ABC-owned cable channels like Arts &
Entertainment and, particularly, the History Channel, where, said
Senior News Vice President Joanna Bistany yesterday, 'he can
explore the issues.'" If that's not enough, he'll "be available
in 1998 for political coverage."
<P>
<a name="4">
4) On ABC's World News Tonight on December 11 anchor Peter
Jennings introduced a story, as transcribed by MRC intern Joe
Alfonsi: "Now to children and poverty. There is a study today by
a private research group called the National Center for Children
in Poverty which believes that the government's official poverty
level is too low. And they find a disturbing trend about how and
where children are hurting."
<BR>
<DD>
Reporter Rebecca Chase began: "During the last fifteen years
this study found the number of children under the age of six
living in poverty grew from 3.5 million to 6.1 million. That's
one in every four children. And when families living on the edge
of poverty are included, using a cutoff of $28,000 a year for a
family of four, nearly half of all young children are living in
or near poverty. This means the United States has the highest
child poverty rate among industrialized nations."
<BR>
<DD>
Larry Aber of the National Center for Children in Poverty
then charged: "At the period of time when human beings are in
their most formative stages, we have the highest child poverty 
rates. We have the highest poverty rates. And we also make the
least public investments at that stage in life."
<BR>
<DD>
Of course the higher the income you define as poverty the
greater the number of children you can claim live in poverty. I
bet $28,000 -- about twice the official poverty level income for
a family of four -- goes a long way in many parts of the country.
And no word on whether the liberal group counted non-cash
benefits, such as Medicaid, food stamps and housing.
<P>
<a name="5">
5) In his new book titled "The Empty Church: The Suicide of
Liberal Christianity," Thomas Reeves argues that mainline
churches are becoming irrelevant as they cave into liberal
interest groups. Reviewing the book for the November 28 Boston
Globe, reporter Diego Ribadeneira was none too pleased with this
contention. He concluded: "For all their faults, mainline
denominations still lend an important moral voice to a nation
that seems to have become more mean-spirited toward the poor,
minorities, immigrants and gays. This moral dimension of liberal
Christianity is one Reeves fails to address."
<P>
<a name="6">
6) With the assistance of 57 judges across the country who
completed ballots in which they chose the first, second and third
best quotes in 18 categories, the MRC has just published THE BEST
NOTABLE QUOTABLES OF 1996: The Ninth Annual Awards for the Year's
Worst Reporting. Thanks to the work of the MRC's Sara "Hyper-Text" 
Harris, the entire eight-page issue, showcasing over 50 quotes that 
were award winners or runners-up, can now be read on our Web site:
www.mediaresearch.org.

</ul>
<P>
Here are a few of the winners:
<ul>
<li><B>Good Morning Morons Award</B>
<BR>
"You write that you prayed more during your four years in office
than basically at any time in your life and yet I think it's fair
to say, and I hope this doesn't sound too harsh, I think it's
fair to say, you are consistently viewed as one of the more
ineffective Presidents of modern times....What do you think, if
anything, that says about the power of prayer?" <I>-- Bryant Gumbel
interviewing Jimmy Carter about his new book, Living Faith,
November 18 Today. [85 points]</I>
<li><B>Fear of the Competition Award (for Impugning Talk Radio)</B>
<BR>
<I>NBC's Bryant Gumbel:</I> "You mention talk radio. They [relatives of
Oklahoma bombing victims] have some very hard feelings about talk
radio and the hate being spewed by some of those on the far end
of the spectrum."
<br>
<dd>
<I>Bill Moyers:</I> "If anything, talk radio in that part of the world
is more anti-government today than ever. The airwaves are
saturated with hostility, it's just an unremitting vilification
of government. Sometimes it's, sometimes it's, you know, the
government makes mistakes and there are justifiable grievances
against government. But this is, this goes beyond that, it's
excessive. And these people take it like salt in the wound. They
drive around, they turn on their radio, they hear some vicious
attack on government, and they think, `You know, if you strike
the government, you kill my daughter.'" <I>-- Bill Moyers on the
April 12 Today promoting that night's Dateline on the families of
and victims of the Oklahoma City bombing. [105 points]</I>
<li><B>Damn Those Conservatives Award</B>
<BR>
"By being so nice to Pat Buchanan and treating him as a good guy
with bad policies, are we not all guilty of legitimizing his
views and putting a smiling face on a hateful voice?"<I> -- Today's
Bryant Gumbel on what he asked the show's political roundtable
off-air, quoted by Peter Johnson, Feb. 22 USA Today. [57]</I>
<li><B>If the Bias Fits, We Won't Admit Award (for Bias Denial)</B>
<BR>
"When you're talking about pure journalists, I mean reporters,
when you're talking about reporters, not columnists, I don't
think there's any liberal bias. I don't think there really ever
has been." <B>-- Los Angeles Times Senior Washington correspondent
Jack Nelson on CNBC's Politics '96, March 9. [71 points]</B>
<li><B>Quote of the Year</B>
<BR>
"In her Wednesday Commentary page column, Linda Bowles stated
that President Clinton and his former campaign adviser Dick
Morris both were `guilty of callous unfaithfulness to their wives
and children.' Neither man has admitted to being or been proven
to have been unfaithful. The Tribune regrets the error."  --
<B>Chicago Tribune correction, September 5. [88 points]</B>
</ul>
<a name="7">
7) The 1996-97 Family Guide to Prime Time Television is now
available from the Parents Television Council (PTC), a special
project of the Media Research Center. The 40-page booklet
provides a comprehensive study of this year's network prime time
fare -- from a family values perspective. The booklet evaluates
over 90 network shows, giving a green, yellow or red light to
each show based upon the appropriateness for children. If you
watched Face the Nation on Sunday you saw Dick Wolf, the
Executive Producer of NBC's Law & Order, attack the PTC's effort
to alert parents to TV content.
<BR>

8) Last weekend liberal columnist Carl Rowan, who in his
new book tagged as "haters" everyone from Howard Stern to Rush
Limbaugh to Newt Gingrich to liberal columnist Richard Cohen,
made his last appearance on Inside Washington. Seen on PBS
stations around the country, the show is produced at Gannett-owned 
WUSA-TV in Washington, D.C. While panelists on shows like
the McLaughlin Group are paid a few hundred dollars per
appearance, Rowan had a bit of a better deal. 
<BR>
<DD>
Rowan is leaving because negotiations broke down over a new
contract. The December 13 Washington Post reported that Gannett
"insisted he take a 65 percent pay cut in his annual salary of
$123,00 and that he work without a contract."
<BR>
<DD>
$2,500 a week for a half hour show. Not a bad gig while it
lasted.

<h3>AN ANTIDOTE TO GLOBAL POVERTY</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan T. Johnson</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
December 15, 1996

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The economic success of the so-called Four Tigers of Asia -- Hong Kong, 
Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan -- is almost legendary. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Hong Kong, for example, the per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) has increased from $2,279 in 1965 to $22,527 in 1995 -- a tenfold jump. In the Republic of China on Taiwan the increase was equally dramatic: from $1,133 to $13,235. This is extraordinary progress.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Unfortunately, such economic success is by no means universal. During the same 30-year period many other less-developed countries have stagnated or declined economically. In our own backyard, Haiti's per-capita GDP was $360 in 1965; by 1994 it was down to $225. Peru's per-capita GDP fell from $1,137 to $1,103. And Niger's was down from $617 to $272, a staggering 60 percent decline. (All numbers are expressed in constant 1987 dollars.) 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This raises an obvious question: Why do some economies blossom and flower, while others whither on the economic vine?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The answer, while obvious in one sense, is not what typically comes to mind. Contrary to pupular belief, a country's economic success does not depend on its possession of, or access to, inexpensive natural resources, such as oil, on how productive its farmland is, or on the rate at which new technology is introduced into its economy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While these can be important, they are not the key. Hong Kong, for example, must import all the raw materials and energy it uses, has no arable land to speak of, and was no more advanced technologically than any other developing country 30 years ago. Yet its economy has boomed. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	By contrast, 10 percent of the land in the West African nation of Gabon is arable and the country is a major source of diamonds. But its economy is a basket case. Indeed, at $2,770, Gabon's per-capita GDP was larger than Hong Kong's in 1965. Today, however, it is about one-sixth the size of Hong Kong's. What accounts for this?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The answer is economic freedom. All of the countries that have graduated from the under-developed world to the developed world in the past 20 years -- Chile, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan -- have free economies. Gabon, Haiti, Niger and Peru have unfree economies, as do most other countries around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The correlation between economic freedom and prosperity is clearly demonstrated by the <a href="/heritage/index">"The Heritage Foundation/Wall Street Journal Index of Economic Freedom."</a> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To conduct this study, we rated each of 150 countries on 10 economic factors that -- depending on the policies the countries pursue -- can either encourage or serve as an impediment to economic growth and wealth creation. Specifically, we looked at their banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and price policies; the size of their government sectors; property rights; regulatory restrictions; and black market activity, a "negative indicator" showing that something is amiss elsewhere in the economy. 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Each country was given a rating of one to five in each category, one being the best, five the worst. The individual scores were then added up and averaged. Each country's average score on the "Index of Economic Freedom" was then overlayed on a grid showing the country's per-capita GDP. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What we found was more than a coincidence. In short: Virtually all of the countries with the highest per-capita income levels, or the most rapidly growing economies, were those with the best (i.e. lowest) scores on the "Index." Conversely, the poorest countries -- places like Angola, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Laos, Mozambique, North Korea and Sudan -- have the worst scores on the "Index." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What does this mean in terms of global poverty? We asked economist <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a>, the former chief economist of Sprint Corp., to answer this question.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Beach chose as his example the People's Republic of Bangladesh, a South Asian country of 128 million residents whose per-capita GDP last year was just $1,290 -- less than half of what Gabon's was 30 years ago.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If the Bangladesh economy -- which ranks in the bottom quarter on the "Index" -- continues to "grow" at its current rate, Beach found, Bengali living standards won't reach the level currently enjoyed by the western nations for another 102 years. If, on the other hand, Bangladesh frees its economy and it can achieve a rate of growth equal to the "Four Tigers" of Asia, the Bengali people could be living as well as Americans do today in just 40 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Poverty is not a natural state for any country. It is largely a condition imposed on people by ill-conceived and repressive economic policies. Free up the latent economic energies of poor nations, and prosperity will follow.

<h3>FOREIGN AID FALLACIES</h3>
by <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan T. Johnson</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
December 15, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The bureaucrats and consultants who profit from America's $12 billion-per-year foreign-aid program argue that U.S. assistance is vital to the economic well-being of the world's less-fortunate. This argument is both self-serving and ignorant.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Self-serving because approximately 70 cents out of every foreign-aid dollar never makes it overseas: It funds the very bureaucracy so piously arguing for preserving foreign aid.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Ignorant because many poor countries around the world have been on the American dole for decades; yet, a substantial number of them are poorer today than when it all began. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why? Because global poverty is largely a condition imposed on people by their governments. While climate, culture, education, infrastructure, land arability, natural resources, technological innovation, and other factors all may contribute to a country's economic success, no country can succeed in the long run unless it has a free economy -- even if it receives buckets of U.S. aid.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider this: Of the 77 countries with the most repressed economies in the world, 34 have been receiving U.S. foreign aid for periods ranging from 35 years to 52 years. Of these 34 countries, 13 are poorer today than they were in 1965 and 10 others are just as poor as they were three decades ago. If foreign assistance was an effective development tool, every one of the 34 countries should have shown some improvement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Look at Somalia. The Clinton administration has argued that cutting foreign aid to less-developed countries would produce "more Somalias." If this is meant to imply that Somalia is an economic basket case because it hasn't received enough U.S. aid, that's nonsense. Somalia has received nearly $1 billion in U.S. foreign aid over the last 41 years. Because the country has one of the world's least-free economies, however, the $1 billion has done little for Somalia, except, perhaps, line the pockets of Somali bureaucrats and overlords. Somalia's gross domestic product (GDP), meanwhile, was $123 per capita in 1965; in 1993 -- after some 40 years on the U.S. dole -- it was down to $111 per capita.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Closer to home, Haiti has been receiving U.S. foreign aid for 52 years. During its half-a-century on the dole, Haiti has received more than $1 billion from the United States, not including the money we spent on our 1994 military operation to "restore democracy" in Haiti and the additional money we're now spending to protect the current regime. How has Haiti benefitted? In 1965, Haiti's per capita GDP was $360; in 1994 it was $225. (All numbers are taken from the 1996 World Bank report, "World Data 1995 on CD ROM," and are expressed in constant 1987 dollars.)
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Peru is another case in point. Peru has received nearly $2 billion in U.S. aid over the last 52 years. It's per-capita GDP has fallen from $1,137 in 1965 to $1,103 in 1994.
A similar story can be seen in Niger, which has pocketed more than $500 million in U.S. assistance, only to see its per-capita wealth decline more than 60 percent, from $617 in 1965 to $272 in 1994.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These are, admittedly, extreme (though not rare) cases. Some aid recipients have increased their wealth -- but it's despite the foreign aid, not because of it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	My colleague <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a>, the former chief economist of Sprint Corp., Kansas City, uses sophisticated computer-modeling techniques to illustrate the point. In his chapter in the recently published <a href="/heritage/index">1997 edition</a> of the "Heritage Foundation/Wall Street Journal Index of Economic Freedom," Beach looked at the South Asian country of Bangladesh -- and what its economic future would look like under various scenarios.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While the country's economy is not the most repressed in the world -- that honor is shared by Cuba, Laos and North Korea -- it currently ranks in the bottom third on the Index of Economic Freedom, 118th out of the 150 countries rated. The result of Bangladesh's high tax rates, closed trade policy, and highly regulated economy was a meager 2.1 percent average annual growth rate during the period 1980-1993.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many other countries -- all of them with freer economies than Bangladesh's -- did much better. For example, Botswana's economy is one of the freest in sub-Saharan Africa, earning it a ranking of 59th on the list of 150 countries I studied. Botswana's economy grew at an average rate of 6.2 percent from 1980 to 1993. South Korea's economy (27th on the list) grew at an average annual rate of 8.2 percent. And Thailand's (23rd) grew at 6.4 percent per year.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Beach posed the following question: "What would happen if Bangladesh implemented [free-market] policies that enabled it to grow at the same long-term rates experienced" by Botswana, S. Korea and Thailand? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If Bangladesh simply stays the course, and continues to grow at just over 2 percent per year, Beach's calculations show that it would take Bangladesh 50 years to raise its living standards to that of contemporary Brazil (which ranks 94th on the Index) -- and 102 years to reach America's current standard of living. However, Beach found, if Bangladesh reforms its economy and can achieve long-term growth rates equal to Botswana's and Thailand's, in just 25 years it could raise its living standards "roughly" to the levels currently enjoyed by such European nations as Spain and Portugal, and in 40 years could be where America is today.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While short-term economic assistance can help newly independent countries develop commercial codes and achieve other concrete goals, the foreign assistance program that has been a staple of U.S. foreign policy for the past 50 years has achieved few lasting successes, and frequently does more harm than good by delaying needed economic reforms.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The next time Congress reviews U.S. foreign aid, it should face up to the fact that U.S. assistance rarely helps the poor. Only economic freedom can truly end the wrenching poverty that continues to plague the world.
<p>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva"><B>Freedom.</B> That's the important conclusion of the <i>1997 Index of Economic Freedom</i>, published jointly by <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, the prominent Washington, D.C., think tank, and <a href="http://wsj.com"><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></a>, the international financial daily.
<p>
The <i>Index</i> proves that the path to prosperity has the same starting point worldwide: economic freedom. The higher a country <A HREF="/heritage/index/rankings.html">ranks</A> on the <i>1997 Index of Economic Freedom</i>, the faster it is likely to grow, improving the living standards of its people. The more a government interferes in the free market, the slower the economy and the poorer the citizens.
<p>
In addition to lively essays by Heritage analysts and editors from the <i>Wall Street Journal's</i> Editorial Page, the Index provides country-by-country analyses of the world's economies. With up-to-date data on 150 countries, it's a practical, readable reference on tax rates, tariffs, banking, foreign investment codes, regulations, and more. 
<p>
The  <i>1997 Index of Economic Freedom</i> is an indispensable handbook for anyone who invests or does business abroad. And it's an essential guide to growth for those who want to understand why some countries prosper and others lag behind.

<h2>The Market's Medical Miracles</h2>
<b>by John Hood</b>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The critics of corporate America would have us believe that it has poorly served the health-care needs of the American people. Labor Secretary Robert Reich, for one, claims that corporations have a moral duty to provide "health-care protections" to their employees. Perhaps that is because the debate in recent years has focused almost exclusively on gaps in our employment-based system of health insurance.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Most of us, it is true, have at least part of our medical bills paid by health plans provided by our employers. While the debate about employee health insurance is an important one, it doesn't account for the greatest contributions of free enterprise to U.S. medical care. When corporations create wealth and address human needs through innovation and productivity, they contribute to the health of Americans in ways at least as important as providing health insurance.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Within the health-care industry, profit-seeking companies have generated tremendous innovations in recent years in such areas as cancer treatment, disease prevention, and computer-assisted diagnostic tools. In cases such as heart surgery, knee surgery, and the removal of gall bladders and hernias, devices and techniques pioneered by American firms and researchers have  reduced or eliminated hospital stays and reduced invasiveness, pain, and recovery time. From 1985 to 1989 alone, the percentage of surgeries performed outside hospitals increased from 37 percent to more than 50 percent.<p>

	America's competitive impulse generates medical innovation not only for American consumers but for the entire world. About half the world's output of medical devices occurs in the United States, and private research and development spending by U.S. pharmaceutical and device manufacturers dwarfs that of other nations. And despite the fact that other countries with less market-oriented economies benefit from U.S. medical innovations, Americans still enjoy more access to quality health care than virtually any other nation, according to studies by the journal <i>Health Affairs</i> and others.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Medical research in the United States, whether in private laboratories or universities, is predominantly funded by corporations with an interest in developing products and studying diseases. Nine of every 10 useful new drugs come from private pharmaceutical firms, not the government. In the area of biotechnology alone, private investors have spent more than $10 billion in the past decade bankrolling hundreds of new companies. "No other nation on Earth could have generated so much capital to launch biotechnology companies," James Vincent, the chairman and CEO of Biogen, has said. "It's because no other nation has the free-market system of risk and reward that America does."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Here's one typical example: Genentech, one of the nation's leading biotechnology companies, is currently seeking government approval for a drug that treats acute stroke by dissolving blood clots. This single drug, called TPA, will help reduce the debilitating effects of a condition that affects 400,000 Americans each year and is the leading cause of adult disability, often leading to paralysis and loss of vision or speech. No other treatment exists. TPA is already administered to some 135,000 heart patients because of its benefits for that condition. Yes, Genentech makes a lot of money from TPA -- $300 million in 1995. Marketing the drug to treat strokes will probably add another $100 million in annual sales. But many who suffer from heart disease and stroke no doubt view the drug's $2,200 yearly cost to be worth it.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More importantly, Genentech's success exemplifies the payoff for addressing a critical human health need. Its example makes it all the more likely that other profit-seeking individuals or firms will ameliorate or cure other major medical conditions in the future. It's the profit motive, not native intelligence or the existence of government programs, that has made the United States the world leader in inventions, patents, and discoveries.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Perhaps the most persuasive case for deploying free enterprise to meet America's health-care needs can be found in routine eye care, which is typically not covered by insurance. Eyeglasses, contact lenses, and eye examinations cost less today in real terms than ever before, particularly when the increased quality of eye care is factored into the equation.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In a 50-year career in optometry, entrepreneur Bob Morrison has contributed significantly to this development. In 1963, while working in a basement lab, Morrison helped fashion the first soft contact lenses, then patented them with two other scientists. At one time, Morrison's firm was making every soft lens sold in the U.S. His rights to the technology were later sold to Bausch & Lomb, but Morrison went on to develop and make other lenses.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In 1991, Morrison's trip to the Middle East inspired yet another venture. At a bazaar, reports <i>Business Week</i>, Morrison saw a rugmaker arguing with his children. The kids wanted their father to retire, Morrison's interpreter explained, because he was making so many mistakes on the rugs. Morrison realized that the man, only 42, was gaffe-prone because he could hardly see. He needed glasses but couldn't afford them.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To meet the universal need for low-cost optical care, Morrison and his son created Instant Eyeglasses -- prescription glasses that can be assembled in minutes and sold for about $20 a pair, compared to the average retail cost of $135. Instead of custom-made lenses for each set of frames, Morrison uses prefabricated lenses that fit into frames that can be snapped together and adjusted to fit any face. With only 152 lenses, rotated to various positions within the standard frames, Instant Eyeglasses can fill 26,000 prescriptions.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But contributions to health don't come only from the health-care industry. Oil companies, for example, have vastly improved the health status of people around the world. Innovation in plastics and other petrochemicals have made possible mass inoculations (with hypodermic needles), surgical devices, life-support systems, artificial limbs and organs, and treatments of various diseases. Thanks to innovations in a range of industries, healthful fruits and vegetables are cheap and plentiful, and workplaces, homes, and transportation are safer. All of these pleasant developments have improved our health and longevity.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Free enterprise in America's medical marketplace promises more of these tremendous medical benefits, particularly in the information and telecommunications industries. Electronic mail, or e-mail, has already become commonplace in doctor's offices. The automation of medical records leads many analysts to speculate that we are not far away from personal "health ID cards." These will provide doctors with an up-to-date record of previous medical conditions and procedures, making diagnoses more accurate and treatment safer and more effective.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Furthermore, commercial on-line services such as CompuServe and America Online offer health reference databases and the opportunity to discuss health issues with fellow patients or health professionals. Jeff Newman, a commodities trader at the Chicago Board of Trade, used a CompuServe forum to request information after he developed recurring polyps in his throat. His doctor said that the only treatment was to keep having them removed by surgery. But Newman, whose job requires him to shout, wanted an alternative. A CompuServe user in Seattle suggested that a compound in cabbage juice might slow the growth of polyps. It worked. "If it were not for e-mail and CompuServe, I believe my life would have regressed along with my hope," Newman told <i>USA Today</i>.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Information services and e-mail will play an increasingly important role in health care, according to Jerome Kassirer, the editor of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. "On-line computer-assisted communication between patients and medical databases -- and between patients and physicians," he wrote in the <i>Journal</i>, "promises to replace a substantial amount of the care now delivered in person." That will not only save money but also, he argued, improve the quality of care. "The interaction with an on-line computer system can be quite comfortable," he said. "Studies show that many patients feel even less discomfort 'talking' to a computer about personal matters than to a physician."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even more futuristic technologies may one day dramatically reduce the cost and improve the quality of medical services. A hospital in Asheboro, North Carolina, recently brought a new worker on board that can deliver medications and other items much more cheaply than the hospital could previously manage. The worker costs only $6 an hour, carries as much as 200 pounds at a time, and will work 365 days a year. It is the HelpMate, a robot that navigates the hospital using a computer and sophisticated sensors.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Health economists predict that devices and techniques for self-diagnosis and treatment will play an increasingly important role in providing good care while controlling costs. Indeed, self-medication with over-the-counter products such as aspirin and ibuprofen already helps control health-care expenditures. The National Center for Policy Analysis estimates that if only 2 percent of nonprescription drug customers sought professional care instead of self-medicating, the number of primary-care physicians would have to rise 50 percent to meet the increased demand. The extent of self-medication owes much to private-sector innovations in pharmaceuticals, packaging, marketing, and transportation.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Software companies like Microsoft, computer makers like IBM and Dell, even manufacturers of robotics, plastics, and fiber optics are investing billions of dollars in the development of computer and information technologies. Do these firms consciously set out to improve health care? Probably not. But their profit-seeking actions have demonstrably done so.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Private enterprise contributes to our health in an even more basic way than advancing drug research or promoting technological change. Because the U.S. economy provides basic goods and services at relatively low cost, families can afford to spend more to improve their lives. From 1960 to 1992, real spending on food as a share of GDP fell by nearly a third, as technological innovations helped farmers increase their productivity and reduce spoilage. Spending on clothes stayed constant during the same period. These trends freed up household income for services such as discretionary medical care and recreation. By generating unprecedented economic production, our economy has given families the financial wherewithal to purchase medical services and otherwise improve their health in a way that our grandparents and great-grandparents would find truly mind-boggling.

<P><blockquote>
In late October 1995, John Sweeney won the presidency of the AFL&#173;CIO.
 Over this period, Sweeney has gained considerable attention in
an attempt to revitalize the old big labor movement as a political
force.<BR>

<P>
Sweeney has launched a massive campaign against Republican members
of Congress.  His long&#173;term strategy is to transform labor
unions from mere representatives of employees in the business
environment to a social movement.  <BR>

<P>
The question is: Will Sweeney's strategy reverse or accelerate
the long decline of big labor?<BR>

<P>
<a name="one">
<center><i> The State of Big Labor</i></center><BR>

<P>
Union membership has been in decline for some time now, as noted
in the chart below.  In 1995, 14.9 percent of the total workforce
was unionized, just a little more than half of 1975's 28.9 percent.
 In the private sector, just 10.4 percent were union members in
1995, down from 16.8 percent in 1983, for example.  In the public
sector, 37.8 percent of government workers were union, up a bit
from the 36.7 percent level in 1983, but actually down from 38.7
percent in 1994.  <BR>

<P>
In gross numbers, union membership has declined from 22.2 million
in 1975 to 16.4 million in 1995.  This 1995 number is a decline
of 300,000 over 1994 levels.  Private&#173;sector union membership
registered 9.4 million in 1995, versus 9.6 million in 1994 and
12 million in 1983.  Public&#173;sector union membership equaled
6.9 million in 1995, down from 7.1 million in 1994, but up from
5.7 million in 1983.<BR>

<P>
To summarize, union membership as a share of the total workforce
is steadily falling.  Among private&#173;sector workers, union
membership is in outright free fall, while among government employees
it has stagnated for some time.  These trends, of course, point
to a strong shift in the composition of union members from the
private sector to government.  <BR>

<P>
Between 1960 and 1995, government employees as a share of union
membership have increased by 600 percent, from a mere 6 percent
to 42 percent.  As noted in the chart of the previous page, if
the average annual rates of change in private and public&#173;sector
union memberships for the first part of 1990s hold for the foreseeable
future, then in about ten years, government employees will account
for a majority of union members.<BR>

<P>
Union officials understand these trends far too well.  They know
that in competitive, private&#173;sector markets &#173;&#173;
where the link between productivity and compensation only grows
stronger &#173;&#173; union membership is on an inevitable decline.
 They also understand that most private&#173;sector employees,
who see opportunities to advance their careers and make better
lives for themselves and their families, view unions as more a
hindrance than a help.  In addition, employees who ultimately
wish to become employers themselves see few, if any, benefits
emanating from union membership.  America's entrepreneurial spirit
works against big labor.<BR>

<P>
Indeed, overall public confidence in organized labor runs very
low.  A 1994 survey of adults revealed that only the media, international
and foreign relief and exchange organizations, political parties,
and government fare worse than labor unions in terms of public
confidence.  In addition, the 22.7 percent of adults expressing
&quot;very little&quot; confidence in major corporations &#173;&#173;
regularly demonized by labor leaders &#173;&#173; rates better
than the 29.1 percent who possess &quot;very little&quot; confidence
in labor organizations.  Social activist groups (e.g., civil rights,
social justice, and community improvement organizations) score
slightly worse than labor in the &quot;great deal&quot; of public
confidence category, while scoring slightly better in the &quot;very
little&quot; confidence category.  Small business and religious
organizations ranked most favorable in the survey.<BR>

<P>
<a name="two">
<center><i>Where is Sweeney Taking Labor?</center></i><BR>

<P>
While Mr. Sweeney and his colleagues fully understand the dismal
position of labor unions, their strategy for big labor's redemption
is destined to failure.<BR>

<P>
Under Sweeney, the AFL&#173;CIO levied a &quot;Sweeney tax&quot;
of 15 cents per capita per month on the AFL&#173;CIO's 78 member
unions in order to raise $35 million for an attack campaign on
Republican members of Congress during the 1996 election year.
 This money is being spent on media ads and organizing activities
in targeted congressional districts to defeat vulnerable &#173;&#173;
mostly freshman &#173;&#173; members.  When you consider that
the AFL&#173;CIO is targeting about 70 Republicans with this effort,
the dollars average out to roughly $500,000 per race.  Of course,
it is well documented that the unions spend much more.  Estimates
for the 1996 elections place their political expenditures at over
$500 million.  This is an astounding amount of money to spend,
particularly compared to what the candidates themselves spend.
 In an October 1996 Reader's Digest article &quot;Big Labor's
Big Bucks&quot;), Rowland Evans and Robert Novak report that &quot;labor
and its allies spent $850 million&quot; against Gordon Smith in
his January 1996 Oregon U.S. Senate contest versus Democrat Ron
Wyden.<BR>

<P>
The $35 million Sweeney tax is in addition to the roughly $40
million in voluntary contributions that union members give to
political action committees, according to The New York Times (April
3, 1996).  As mentioned above, Rutgers University economist Leo
Troy estimates that added in&#173;kind contributions from labor
could hit $500 million this year.<BR>

<P>
The ads attack candidates for seeking to slow the growth in or
reduce the size of government.  This makes some sense when you
look at union membership numbers.  Big labor's only chance for
survival rests with government employees.  Naturally, Sweeney
has been overtly hostile to all substantive tax and regulatory
reduction efforts.  The union push to expand the size of government
is not the result of some good natured but misguided view of government,
but instead is a pure Machiavellian effort to keep and possibly
gain power.  <BR>

<P>
Another Sweeney tactic is to transform labor unions from organizations
representing workers in the business environment into vehicles
for social activism.  These efforts include Sweeney's &quot;Union
Summer&quot; and labor &quot;teach&#173;ins,&quot; both designed
to indoctrinate college kids into the class&#173;warfare, exploitation
thesis of life that the AFL&#173;CIO is pushing anew.  <BR>

<P>
Union Summer provided $210&#173;a&#173;week stipends and free
housing for about 1,200 college students to protest at and disrupt
workplaces across the nation.  Students also were taught the fine
art of harassing business executives during personal functions,
like weddings and Sunday church outings.  The Sweeney recommended
reading list included &quot;Rules for Radicals.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Both Union Summer and the teach&#173;ins tap into hard&#173;core
left&#173;wing academics, mending a long&#173;time split with
labor unions.  Since the early 1950s, the AFL&#173;CIO took a
strong anti&#173;communist stand.  This aggravated liberal academia
and left the unions very leery of professors with Marxist tendencies.
 <BR>

<P>
Such concerns apparently do not bother Mr. Sweeney.  After all,
The Weekly Standard (October 21, 1996) recently reported that
Sweeney is a member of Democratic Socialists of America, that
communists were allowed to distribute literature at Sweeney's
nominating convention, and according to the People's Weekly World,
&quot;for the first time in 40 years, Communist trade unionists
were elected delegates and spoke.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Sweeney is pushing these academics to create crisis thinking,
with unions being offered as a main conduit for much&#173;needed
social activism.  The Chicago Tribune (October 6, 1996) quotes
Sweeney at one of these teach&#173;ins: &quot;We need your help
in exposing the flaws of our society.  While it takes a village
to raise a child, it takes a union to get a raise.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Sweeney also shows little regard for the law and common civility.
 His tactics include abusive corporate campaigns, and he refuses
to rule out the use of violence. Corporate campaigns include picketing
and public attacks not only on targeted companies but on their
lenders, suppliers, and customers, not to mention board members
at their homes and churches; abuse of federal and state regulatory
bodies with baseless and frivolous complaints in order to raise
the costs of doing business; disrupting shareholder meetings;
and salting (where union organizers apply for jobs in non&#173;union
businesses with the intention of either bringing a lawsuit if
not hired, or causing work disruptions if hired).  Corporate campaigns
are a favorite of Sweeney.  &quot;We will use old&#173;fashioned
mass demonstrations, as well as sophisticated corporate campaigns,
to make worker rights the civil rights issue of the 1990s,&quot;
declared Sweeney in his AFL&#173;CIO acceptance speech.  <BR>

<P>
Sweeney especially basks in employing so&#173;called civil disobedience.
 In 1995, his Service Employees International Union (SEIU) blocked
the 14th Street Bridge in Washington, D.C. at rush hour as part
of their &quot;Justice for Janitors&quot; campaign.  &quot;Justice
for Janitors&quot; has used guerrilla&#173;style blockades of
sidewalks and traffic in several cities.  Investor's Business
Daily (November 14, 1995) reported that Sweeney threatened the
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors with &quot;a massive campaign
of resistance and retribution&quot; in July 1995 if workers were
laid off.  Outside the building 3,000 SEIU members gathered with
20 arrested for blocking roads.  As the American Spectator reported,
Sweeney has declared: &quot;I believe in blocking bridges.&quot;
 <BR>

<P>
When asked by Nation's Business (February 1996) if there was anything
in a corporate campaign that's below the belt, Sweeney responded
coyly: &quot;I would hope that we would be reaching out attempting
to build bridges between labor and management, but I think that
when workers are not getting the attention they are entitled to,
that other tactics have to be considered.  I would hope that we
would have the good sense to use all of the peaceful opportunities
to avoid a possible strike or confrontation.&quot;  Quite a chilling
response, isn't it?<BR>

<P>
  
<P>
<a name="three">
<center><i>Sweeney's Impact</center></i><BR>

<P>
Sweeney essentially is linking up the AFL&#173;CIO with groups
and philosophies that have witnessed their power and influence
waning in recent years, such as social activists of the 1960s
variety, left&#173;wing academics, socialists, communists, etc.
 In addition, he has removed any vestiges of non&#173;partisanship
with his vitriolic attacks on Republicans.  Under Sweeney, no
one can seriously doubt that the AFL&#173;CIO is now just another
arm of the Democratic Party.<BR>

<P>
In addition, the &quot;Sweeney tax&quot; and the political attack
campaign may only accelerate union's loss of membership.  According
to a recent poll by Frank Luntz, 62 percent of the union's members
were opposed to the deployment of their dues against Republican
candidates, and 44 percent identified themselves as conservatives.
 <BR>

<P>
Even for those who support these attacks, they are bound to be
aggravated by the lack of results from such a massive spending
effort.  In his September 27 Wall Street Journal column, Paul
Gigot declared that &quot;labor's early spending assault on Republicans
might yet be the political investment of the century.&quot;  While
Mr. Gigot is normally right on with his analysis, in this case,
he could not be more wrong.  Both the House of Representatives
and the Senate will likely stay in Republican hands on November
5.  Indeed, Republicans will probably pick up some seats, in which
case, Sweeney's tax&#173;and&#173;spend effort will go down in
history as one of the most wasteful and unsuccessful political
expenditures of the twentieth century.<BR>

<P>
In the end, Sweeney's actions are analogous to the band that supposedly
kept playing while the Titanic sank.  All the major forces in
the economy, politics, and society are moving against Sweeney's
plans for big labor.  On the economics front, technological advancements
in the areas of computers and telecommunications are pushing forward
with economic decentralization.  Increasing levels of entrepreneurship
are turning employees into employers.  Home&#173;based businesses
are skyrocketing.  National and global competition is increasing.
 Big labor's preferences for high taxes, excessive regulation,
protectionism, and class warfare never made economic sense, and
this only becomes clearer today.<BR>

<P>
On the political front, taxpayers are increasingly unwilling to
give more and more of their money away to wasteful government
ventures.  At the very least, people are demanding restraint from
their government, and calls for smaller government are only growing
louder.<BR>

<P>
Finally, society in general seems to at least be awakening to
many of the ills that so&#173;called &quot;social activism&quot;
has wrought.  Tolerance for bankrupt claims of victimhood on the
part of groups and individuals, and for the increasing callous
use of violence, are diminishing every day.  Labor victimhood
as portrayed by Sweeney and his promotion of civil disobedience
will not be accepted by most Americans.  <BR>

<P>
Finding any relevancy for big labor in an increasingly entrepreneurial
economy is a daunting task.  Indeed, big labor's decline is inevitable.
 However, Sweeney could have perhaps slowed this decline by trying
to reformulate the AFL&#173;CIO into an employee organization
much more cognizant of the economic changes currently under way.
 Unfortunately, Sweeney's formula of a highly regulated and taxed
economy,  big government, and &quot;social activism&quot; will
only serve to divide the nation and push the labor movement further
out on the fringe.  <BR>

<P>
Sweeney may have proved that he can spend big dollars on a massive
campaign of distortion, but little else.  In addition to emptying
the unions treasury, one of his main goals was to build its membership
&#173;&#173; a goal of 500,000 new members in two years time.
 Little evidence exists, however, that he is actually reversing
the long decline in union membership.  Rather than investing millions
into recruitment by changing the dark image of the labor movement,
Sweeney has worsened the cause of unions.  One thing is painfully
clear since Sweeney took over the helm of the AFL&#173;CIO &#173;&#173;
union rank&#173;and&#173;file are receiving a poor return on their
investment both from Sweeney as a leader and his divisive and
failing tactics.<BR>

<P>
Sweeney has managed to link the labor movement with the only other
societal entities that suffer similar or even more poorly in terms
of public confidence than labor unions do themselves &#173;&#173;
government, a particular political party, and social activists.
 Additionally, the media, which also rates poorly, usually treats
labor unions quite favorably.  Indeed, misery loves company.<BR>

<P>
Under Sweeney's leadership, it seems clear that big labor will
be a big loser.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In this season of welfare reform, it's worth taking a close look at the professionals in the middle of it, the trained social workers. Just about everyone outside the welfare system is hoping for an end to dependency-causing giveaways, and for their replacement by programs that expect something of recipients in return for their benefits. But will the social workers who administer and implement the new policies deliver?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	They are in a position to undermine welfare reform in a number ways. For one thing, they can fail to be inspiring mentors to those welfare recipients who need to be motivated and guided. Instead of urging them to take responsibility for their lives and get to work, they can encourage whining and blaming others. Instead of chiding them for bad habits and urging constructive change, they can excuse their dysfunctional lifestyles.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another way social workers can undermine reform is by overusing exemptions to new requirements. The welfare-reform legislation is laden with "escape clauses" that permit case workers to exempt clients from one or another requirement on the grounds of hardship, family needs, and so on. By applying these exemptions generously, case workers can defeat the aim of the legislation.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, social workers can spearhead political campaigns to overturn welfare requirements. Journalists generally rely on social workers and program administrators to arrange interviews with clients and to provide information on how the program is working. If social workers oppose reform, they can focus attention on hardship cases, forcing politicians to repeal or amend it to avoid looking "heartless." For all these reasons, the future of welfare reform depends not just on what the legislation says, but on what social workers believe. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There are some 600,000 social workers in this country, filling a wide variety of social-service roles, from eligibility clerk in government programs to career counselors in high schools. At the center of this profession are the schools of social work whose faculty prepare students for work in government social-service agencies. They award 11,000 baccalaureate and 13,000 master's degrees in social work yearly.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This policy-oriented core of the profession includes a number of influential lobbying organizations. The main groups are the American Public Welfare Association (APWA), which affiliates over 800 state and local welfare agencies, including all the state departments of human services, and the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), with a membership of 155,000 social workers. As a measure of their political activism, one poll of NASW members found that 64 percent contributed money to political campaigns in 1984, and 33 percent reported lobbying for legislation. Prominent policymakers with a social-work background (an M.S.W. degree) include Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Congressmen Ron Dellums of California and Edolphus Towns of New York, all Democrats.<p><b>Mocking Their Past</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It comes as no surprise that members of this occupational sector lean strongly to the left. The NASW regularly backs Democratic candidates; in 1996, its delegate assembly endorsed Clinton-Gore over the GOP ticket by a vote of 168 to 6. Even more significant than their political bias, however, is their professional bias. Today's social workers hold views about poverty -- what causes it and what they should do about it -- that refute the spirit of welfare reform. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The social-work profession grew out of the assistance activities of 19th-century charitable organizations. As Marvin Olasky, David Green, Gertrude Himmelfarb, and others have pointed out, private, voluntary groups proliferated during that time, successfully ministering to the needs of the poor. Leading these organizations were dozens of reformers who articulated an empirically based approach to assisting the poor. These "charity theorists" included Mary Richmond, Josephine Shaw Lowell, S. Humphreys Gurteen, Annie Fields, and Edward Devine in the United States, and Octavia Hill, Helen Bosanquet, Thomas Mackay, and Arthur Paterson in Great Britain. From their extensive personal experience with the poor, these early social workers reached a clear consensus on the principles of helping the poor. <p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The beliefs of modern social workers are practically the opposite of the principles of social assistance developed by the founders of the profession. Instead of building on its past, modern social work mocks it. <p><b>To Give or Not To Give</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 19th-century charity theorists advocated a highly personalized approach to working with the needy. They emphasized the capacity of poor individuals to respond to life's demands, and believed in pushing them to achieve independence and a better life. The social worker was first and foremost a mentor and advisor, one who guided individuals to improve themselves and make better choices. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	One point on which they all agreed was that giveaways of material assistance -- cash, food, housing, clothing -- are generally harmful to the poor. Of course they saw that the poor had need of these things, but they also saw that it was vital that the poor fill these needs for themselves. Well-meaning reformers who stepped in with some form of dole undermined their self-esteem and impaired their capacity to thrive independently. "My friends," said Octavia Hill in an 1876 speech, "I have lived face to face with the poor for now some years, and I have not learned to think gifts of necessaries, such as a man usually provides for his own family, helpful to them. I have abstained from such, and expect those who love the poor and know them individually will do so more and more in the time to come."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With the rise of massive government welfare programs, social workers abandoned this view. One of the first principles to be jettisoned was the idea that neediness could play a positive, motivating role. For the modern social worker, any kind of suffering or being in need is wrong. "Human suffering is undesirable and should be prevented, or at least alleviated, whenever possible," declares Herbert Bisno in <i>The Philosophy of Social Work</i> (Public Affairs Press, 1952). This declaration misses the complexity of human motivation. Extreme forms of suffering are indeed incapacitating and therefore harmful. But intermediate levels of deprivation -- or the anticipation of such -- motivate constructive choices, from getting up in the morning to go to work, to avoiding bad habits like gambling, alcohol abuse, and overeating. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Armed with the idea that neediness is always wrong, social work then derived the notion that filling someone else's needs is always right. Although social work still aims to enable people to cope with the world, uplift has taken second place to the idea of filling material needs. The NASW's "Definition of Social Work" (approvingly repeated in the introductory text <i>Social Work</i>, published by Allyn and Bacon in 1995), asserts that the first "end" of social-work practice is "helping people obtain tangible services"; it puts "counseling and psychotherapy" second. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another introductory text announces the giveaway mission in its title: <i>Social Welfare: A Response to Human Need</i> (Allyn and Bacon, 1994). Like so many of the textbooks, it downplays the idea that the poor should be expected to work for a living. Indeed, "work" is never mentioned as a solution to poverty. The book labels the belief "that each person should be responsible for meeting his or her own needs" as "rugged individualism" and dismisses it: "This situation is neither possible in contemporary society nor desirable in terms of optimal human growth and development."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In contrast to 19th-century writings, modern social-work texts never point to a situation when the social worker should not give material aid to a needy person. In the indexes to these volumes, there are no entries under "dependency" or "incentives" or "motivation." In <i>The Encyclopedia of Social Work</i>, published by the NASW, the entry for "Income Maintenance System" considers the idea that "income maintenance assistance robs recipients of their incentive to work" an unfounded "suspicion." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Privately, social workers will mention cases where welfare encourages idleness and other dysfunctional behavior like having babies one cannot support. But in official pronouncements, social-work leaders avoid or dismiss the notion that benefit programs might be drawing vulnerable individuals into dependency and even ruin.<p>
<b>No Judge of Lifestyles</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	The 19th-century charity workers expressed strong convictions about what behavior would help people rise from poverty. They had clear opinions on the obvious vices -- drunkenness, gambling, extramarital sex, idleness, and so forth -- as well as on many ordinary choices. For example, Octavia Hill believed it was unhealthy for families to live all in one room -- as most of them wished to do in order to save the cost of renting a second room. As a volunteer housing manager, she used her powers of gentle persuasion to get tenants to pay extra and take two rooms. (After the move was made, she reported, tenants themselves would typically admit it was a wise use of their money.)<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This emphasis on values has all but disappeared from modern social work. The orientation today is on not swaying welfare recipients in their choices. One value of social work, says John Brown's <i>Handbook of Social Work Practice</i> (Charles C. Thomas, 1992), is a "nonjudgmental attitude," which means that "social workers should not judge clients' behavior by imposing a moral value on it." The introductory text <i>The Practice of Social Work</i> (Dorsey Press, 1985) criticizes "the layperson's views that a social worker seeks to 'remold' clients into a pattern chosen by the worker." The professional view is that clients "should be permitted to determine their own lifestyles as far as possible."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Social work assumes the inherent worth and importance of the individual," says the <i>Introduction to Social Work</i> (Prentice Hall, 1991). From this seemingly unobjectionable premise, the authors reach a startlingly indulgent conclusion: "The person's worth is validated equally by his or her decision to achieve potential or to permit it to lie unused, by a decision to achieve or merely vegetate."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The notion that social workers must be neutral paralyzes them as advisors or mentors. Of course, in any advising situation a dogmatic style is generally counterproductive, and no one piece of advice fits everyone. The 19th-century workers, with their personal, individualized approach, knew this well. They stressed the importance of tact and patience in projecting healthy values. But they were in no doubt about the need to project these values. Today's social workers have genuinely internalized a value-free approach. This leads them to be complacent about programs that validate and reinforce destructive lifestyles, such as income support for unwed mothers or for alcoholics and drug addicts.<p><b>Never Their Fault </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The 19th-century charity theorists knew that there were many environmental causes of poverty. They were fully aware of the unhealthy living conditions of the poor, and the dreadful lack of opportunities they faced. To remedy such environmental problems, they advocated public policies that addressed them, such as sanitary improvements and the development of parks and gardens. But they also knew that many poor people were held back by their own shortcomings: by vices, by family breakup, by unhealthy habits and shortsighted choices. In their policies of individual social assistance, therefore, they endeavored to improve character. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In 1875, after a decade of serving as a befriending manager of low-income housing units, Octavia Hill pointed to the importance of personal behavior. "The people's homes are bad, partly because they are badly built and arranged; they are tenfold worse because the tenants' habits and lives are what they are. Transplant them to-morrow to healthy and commodious homes, and they would pollute and destroy them. There needs, and will need for some time, a reformatory work which will demand that loving zeal of individuals which cannot be had for money, and cannot be legislated for by Parliament."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Most modern social workers have abandoned this balanced, logical view. The textbooks smugly criticize 19th-century charity workers for their "judgmental attitudes toward the poor." They find it lamentable that social workers in those benighted days "held to the notion that individual failure was the reason for poverty." The modern view is that the needy cannot be held responsible for their problems. Indeed, anyone who suggests otherwise is engaging in the cardinal no-no of "blaming the victim."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	An environmental explanation of poverty underlies social workers' policy recommendations. Whatever the problem, it's not up to the needy person to reform or strive; "society" has to give more. In a 1990 editorial on homelessness in <i>Social Work</i>, the magazine of the NASW, editor-in-chief Ann Hartman criticized programs that aimed to treat drug addiction and alcoholism because "they define homelessness in terms of private troubles" -- an unacceptable approach. "Homelessness is a result of the steady disappearance and unavailability of low-cost housing," she declared. "We must be clear that homelessness cannot be reduced appreciably by treating individual troubles."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In expounding such positions, social-work professionals often exhibit a weak grasp of economics. In <i>Social Welfare: A Response to Human Need</i>, we find this tautological explanation: "The distribution of income, the way that income is distributed, is what causes poverty." Social-work professor Mark Robert Rank of Washington University likens the economy to a game of musical chairs with a fixed number of opportunities: "This musical chairs analogy can be applied to what has been taking place in this country economically and socially. Some people will lose in the game, given that there is unemployment and a lack of jobs." This static, zero-sum conception of economic life ignores the fact that people continually create new jobs for themselves and for others -- if we don't undermine their motivation to do so. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The determinism of modern social work is also devastating to the poor. If you want someone to improve, to make an effort to overcome a problem, he has to feel that he is capable of influencing his fate. In the game of life, just as in sports, it is not useful to dwell on the past and to blame others. What would we think of a coach who told his team that the reason they lost was the rainy weather and the bad calls of the referee? Even if this were mainly the truth, it would be unhealthy to dwell upon it. A coach who followed this approach would find that his team loses even when the weather is fine and the referees are fair. <p><b>Welfare Reform: Bigger Is Better</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Social workers today may occasionally pay lip service to welfare reform, but only if it leads to greater spending. In its 1994 policy recommendations, the NASW declared that block grants to the states must never mean cutting benefits: "States should be allowed to diverge from the national base only if they scale benefits upward from it." It fought experiments that demand something from recipients, such as a compulsory work requirement for the recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC).<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In its 1990 recommendations for "Improving the Food Stamp Program," the APWA urged 15 substantive program changes, every one of which had the effect of increasing benefits or the number of beneficiaries. In the latest round of proposed welfare reforms, it has fought virtually all efforts to restrict welfare. It opposes family caps and lifetime limits on benefits; it opposes any effort to end benefits to single individuals, noncitizens, unwed teen mothers, and drug and alcohol abusers. It even opposes denying benefits when these benefits are already duplicated by other welfare programs. <p>

<br>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In a potentially promising shift, the APWA has accepted the idea that some kind of work obligation is appropriate for certain welfare recipients. But in practice, this principle is undermined by the profession's more deeply held conviction that welfare recipients are fragile and incapable, and must be shielded from any possible suffering. Even if a client refuses to participate in an employment plan without good cause, the APWA recommends cutting benefits by only 25 percent.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Furthermore, when the APWA agrees that welfare recipients should be expected to work, it does not mean that they should go to work tomorrow. The APWA approves of a work requirement only if government programs first supply a vast array of additional services to help recipients find and hold a job. For the APWA, welfare reform means a larger, not smaller, government welfare industry. "We know," said a 1987 APWA report urging "real reform," "the investments we propose will cost more money -- more money than the federal and state governments currently invest in low-income families with children."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A spokeswoman for Delaware's "First Step" program gives an idea of the support that welfare administrators feel is necessary to implement the welfare-to-work concept. In this program -- which enrolls less than 5 percent of Delaware's AFDC recipients -- the agency offers a broad smorgasbord of additional benefits to cajole recipients into taking care of themselves: "basic academic and life skills development," "career counseling," "child care," "transportation," "remedial medical such as eyeglasses or eye exams, physical exams, dental work," even "clothing." "If we don't have these supportive services," says the Delaware official, "then the participant cannot succeed." "Cannot" is a strong word when you consider that tens of millions of working poor get and hold jobs without any of these services. <p><b>A Psychology of Coddling</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The welfare industry's premise that recipients must be coddled makes observers skeptical about the latest round of welfare-to-work programs. Remember, these programs were first introduced in 1962, and renewed in legislation passed in 1967, 1971, 1981, and 1988. After 35 years, they're still not successful. A 1994 GAO study of the JOBS program -- the current incarnation of welfare-to-work proposals -- found that only 11 percent of AFDC recipients were even signed up for the program, and the overwhelming majority of these were not in actual on-the-job training, but cycling through support programs such as counseling, job-search preparation, higher education, eye exams, and so on.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some officials in the welfare industry dispute this critical view. One who argues that social workers have now adopted "a surprisingly different approach" is Sid Johnson, the executive director of the American Public Welfare Association. "The dramatic change in 1988" with the Family Assistance Act, he says, "was that a system that for 50 years had been, by public policy, aimed at providing income maintenance made a major shift toward the promotion of self-sufficiency." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But can 50 years of training and ideology be overcome so readily? In most parts of the country, social workers are still wedded to a philosophy of nonjudgmental giveaways. In Michigan, social workers have largely undermined the state's policy of requiring unwed teen mothers to live with responsible adults simply by exempting the teens in question. In Ingham County, 74 of the 85 indigent mothers under age 18 were allowed to keep their welfare checks and their independent lifestyle because social workers decided that adult supervision would jeopardize their "emotional and physical well-being."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In those few places where welfare reform has succeeded, social workers are noticeably absent. In California, all 58 counties are supposed to be pushing welfare recipients into work under the GAIN program begun in 1988, but only one, Riverside, has a well-documented record of success. I asked John Rodgers, assistant to the program's director, what proportion of Riverside's caseworkers are trained social workers. "That's basically a nonexistent classification, in GAIN," he replied. "There are some counties in California that . . . took social workers in their existing organization and moved them over into GAIN. We did not do that at all. We had an open recruitment, and in fact strongly encouraged people from the community who had never worked in a social-services agency to apply for the jobs. We were looking for people that had a variety of skills, but specifically people that had experience in the employment sector, of helping people go to work."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another sign that social workers aren't behind meaningful welfare reform is the lobbying of the NASW. The organization strenuously opposes the welfare reform passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton last August. The NASW has vowed to undertake a "state-by-state monitoring of the welfare reform bill's impact on poor women and children." This is another way of saying that social workers are preparing to provide the media a diet of hardship cases attributable to the reform. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Modern social workers may mean well, but they have absorbed a deficient approach to social assistance policy. They will need a big push from citizens and policymakers to recapture the 19th-century focus on personal improvement and self-sufficiency.<p>

<center><h3>SAD STATE OF EDUCATION</h3></center>

<p>

In his fifth State of the Union address,
President Bill Clinton referred to education as his &quot;number
one priority over the next four years.&quot;  Neatly packaging
it as a 10-point &quot;new-and-improved&quot; solution, Clinton
issued a call for pouring more money into failed government education
programs.

<p>

<u><b>1.  National standards.  National testing in 4th grade reading, 
8th grade math:</b></u> &quot;A national crusade
for education standards -- not federal standards, but national
standards....  <I><B>Every state and school must shape the curriculum
to reflect these standards and train teachers to lift students
up to them</B></I>&quot; [emphasis added].  Forget &quot;voluntary.&quot;
This means every U.S. history teacher must use the <I>National
Standards for United States History</I>.  These standards left
out George Washington's presidency and the U.S. landing on the
moon, but included Madonna and the <I>Challenger</I> shuttle disaster.

<p>

<u><b>2.  National Board for Professional Teaching Standards 
(NBPTS):</b></u> When NBPTS, a board to certify &quot;master teachers,&quot; 
lobbied for federal funding in the late 1980's, it was described as a
teachers union pet.  Chester Finn commented that this &quot;pork
barrel project...set a precedent:  federal aid to a professional
standards board.  If the bill passes [it did], we can expect other
professions and trades to then demand their due [we have -- in
the National Skill Standards Act of Goals 2000].&quot;  As Clinton
points out, only 500 teachers have sought NBPTS certification
since 1995.  As an incentive, the Clinton budget includes funding
for 100,000 more to seek national certification.

<p>

<u><b>3. America Reads Initiative:</b></u> If 825,000 K-3 
classroom teachers, 100,000 Title I teachers and
325,000 special education teachers (almost half of whom have at
least a Masters degree) have only attained a 60 percent success
rate in teaching children to read by the end of third grade, how
will an army of 1,000,000 part-time, half-trained Americorps &quot;volunteers&quot;
do it? Mr. President, we won't settle for your national standard
that all children should be reading by the end of third grade.
We have higher expectations.  We want kids to be reading by the
end of first grade with the help of their classroom teachers who
are paid to teach them.  These kids aren't failures, but the reading
methods they've been taught are.  Reading is not a mysterious
guessing game, but a systematic decoding of the sounds letters
make.  If federal funding can't seem to accomplish the first purpose
of education -- teaching kids to read -- how can we trust any
portion of education to it?

<blockquote>
&quot;This is also a challenge
to every teacher and every 
principal. <i><b>You must 
use these tutors</b></i> to help 
your students read.&quot; 
-- Pres. Clinton
</blockquote>

<p>

<u><b>4. Early Childhood Education:</b></u> &quot;Learning 
begins in the first days of life.&quot;  Just how early, Mr. Clinton? 
This week's <I>TIME</I> magazine cover story (2/03/97) explores the
growing child's brain and points to important developments that
occur before birth.  &quot;At birth a baby's brain contains 100
billion neurons, roughly as many nerve cells as there are stars
in the Milky Way.&quot;  Perhaps the concern for early childhood
education and brain development will lead to a reconsideration
of treatment of children prior to birth.

<u><b>5. Transferring Between Public Schools and Charter Schools:</b></u> 
What Clinton calls school choice is not parental choice in education.
Under his plan, parents could only transfer their children to
another <I>public</I> school.  And when Clinton proposes increased 
funding to create more charter schools, he's missing the point. Charter 
schools are only an advantage if they cost less and have more freedom
than regular public schools.  Because charter schools are actually
public schools, they can provide a back door to more government
control of education if they increase the public share of the
education market.

<p>

<u><b>6. Character Education:</b></u> Clinton called for uniforms, 
curfews, truancy laws, zero tolerance for guns and drugs in schools 
and labeled it &quot;character education.&quot;
But Representative J. C. Watts (R-Okla.), in his response to
the State of the Union address, defined character as doing what's
right when no one is watching.  Such character can only be taught
when curriculum is edifying and when school authorities are respectable
as well as respectful of other authorities in a child's life,
like parents and the church.

<p>

<u><b>7. School Construction:</b></u> To accommodate the anticipated 
surge in school-age children population
over the next decade, Clinton proposed a $5 billion federal subsidy
for school construction.  But even perennial supporters of federal
spending on education have been reluctant to cede the responsibility
of school construction to the federal government.  &quot;Isn't
construction a state and local issue?&quot; asked one state superintendent
last fall at a Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO)
conference (<I>Education Daily</I>, 11/12/96).  Compliance with
federal education mandates has weakened many a local school district
budget.  Let's get to the root of the problem rather than putting
in for new federal funding.

<p>

<u><b>8. Aid for Post-Secondary Education:</b></u> &quot;We must make 
the 13th and 14th years of education -- at least two years of college 
-- just as universal in America by
the 21st century as a high school education is today....&quot;
The old adage, &quot;quality, not quantity,&quot; has some relevance
in education.  By universalizing community college will students
simply be learning in 14 years what they used to learn in 12?

<p>

Former York College president Robert
V. Iosue points out &quot;that more aid will most assuredly jack
the tuition even higher.&quot;  We should &quot;repair the foundation&quot;
of elementary and secondary education, he says, and &quot;stop
gilding the steeple&quot; (<I>Wash. Times</I>, 2/05/97).  If Clinton
supports tax breaks that allow choice of daycare and college,
why doesn't he allow parents to choose their children's school
in between?

<p>

<u><b>9. Lifelong Learning:</b></u> Listening to Clinton speak, 
one wonders if anyone would learn anything without federal involvement 
in education.  The fact is, we do learn throughout our lifetime and 
we don't need federal programs to do it.

<p>

<u><b>10. Internet Access in Every Classroom, Library ... and Home:</b></u> 
Not too long ago, people argued that educational programming on 
television would stamp out illiteracy. While technology can be a useful 
tool, it is not the ultimate solution some make it out to be.  The 
federal government can best promote technological advances in education 
by removing its bureaucratic presence from the playing field of education
so that individuals, families and smaller, sprier groups can carry
the ball farther, faster.

<p>

<b>All told, Clinton wants to spend
$51 billion on education next year.  More federal spending, more
programs.  America has been there and done that, and our schools
are the worse for it.  A ten-point plan telling how to shift money
and power from Washington, D.C., back to parents and local leaders
would be an outline for true reform.</b>

 School vouchers repeat the error of public education</h2>

<hr width=50%></center>
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Most people would agree that the Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees citizens the right to keep and bear arms. Yet not even its most zealous defenders would construe this right to mean that the government should supply everyone with a carbine. Not so, it seems, with education. Most people agree that children have a right to an education, but we have come to accept that the government itself should do the educating, compel all children to attend, and require all citizens to pay for it.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This error in logic has had calamitous consequences. The takeover of education by the states in the mid-19th century and the resulting abdication of authority by the family set in motion a crippling concatenation of usurpation and surrender that continues to this day. Now education is an entitlement claimed by most, yet a right exercised by few.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There was a time when Americans knew the difference between rights and entitlements. A right used to be understood as a claim in justice, our concept of which flowed from tradition and natural law. As Alexander Hamilton put it, "The sacred rights of mankind are written, as with a sun beam in the whole volume of human nature, by the divinity itself; and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power." Our constitutional republican tradition informs us that God, not the state, is the source of rights. The state's role, then, is not to bestow rights, but to protect them by enacting laws consistent with a common tradition of justice and by enforcing those laws impartially.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In a totalitarian regime, by contrast, the source of rights is the all-powerful state, which permits citizens to exercise them only in its interest. The state may decide, for instance, that an armed populace threatens its power, and so suppress the right to keep arms. Similarly, it might decide that a populace able to feed itself independent of the state is not in its interest and suppress the right to own lands. But since starving people cannot labor for the state and are apt to grow restive, the state takes pains to feed them, while declaring solemnly their "right" to eat. Not surprisingly, the accumulation of power by the state gets a little easier with each new intrusion, each new surrender. As Thomas Jefferson famously put it, "The natural progress of things is for government to gain ground and for liberty to yield." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Alas, the state may decide that a highly literate, self-reliant, and pious people is not in its interest, and gradually usurp the right of parents to educate their own children. How? By declaring it a "right" -- an entitlement, actually -- and making it free.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The state funding of education, then, is not an act of benign concern for the cultivation of citizenship, but a hostile assumption of ownership. Before the state began to fund schooling, education was free to the public as a whole; individual families and communities bore the cost while exercising the rights of their children to be educated.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In his book <i>Wealth and Poverty</i>, George Gilder recognized the social value of parents' retaining ownership of their children's education: "Nowhere is the vitality of families today more dramatically expressed than in the inspiring willingness of millions of American parents to save up to ensure a safe and rigorous education for their children. Moreover, this willingness is the highest sign of social responsibility. In their efforts to educate their offspring as best they can, whatever the cost, these families are making a major investment in the future of the country, and in the human capital on which coming generations will depend."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Right now, the parents of 6 million American children (about 12 percent of the total) do not ask government to educate them. These parents own their children's education, either by teaching them at home, or "contracting out" to a private school. This number grows every year, and if conservatives could rally around a single goal, it should be to push that number ever higher. Perhaps one day we will speak of  the 12 percent who still depend on government for schooling and worry about what can be done to help those poor folks.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many of us would say that education is the most serious, intimate, and sacred of all duties that parents owe their children. All parents must ensure that our children eat well, wear clean clothes, and sleep in a warm and secure home. Yet these duties are rather mundane compared to the awesome task of imparting knowledge and skills for self-reliance, instilling habits of virtue, and (many of us believe) preparing their souls for eternity. If we do not expect parents to pay for their own children's education, what credible argument can we then make that they should pay for their food, clothing, shelter, or medicine?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It is not hard to see that once the government had usurped the solemn right of families to educate their children, it was only a matter of time and effort before it could have all the rest. And really, once the government took charge of controlling the minds of our children, the rest is mere table scraps. To tame a stallion you must first break its spirit; only then can it be made faithful and useful to its owner. Government schooling has broken the spirit of the American family. It perpetually affronts parents and denies that God's grace to parents is sufficient to nurture and rear the children He has placed in their loving custody. Government schooling reduces parents to the role of assistants who ensure the completion of homework, help with occasional projects, and get the kids to soccer practice on time. Government schooling is the very linchpin of the welfare state, the foundational tyranny that led to more than a century of servile laws to follow. <p><b>A Setback for Reform</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	So where does education reform stand today? In poor shape. In every other area of welfare reform, from health care to food stamps to housing to social security, the essential question is finally being asked: Is this the proper role of government? Not so with education. Until we acknowledge that government schooling is welfare, real education reform is impossible.

<br>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For several decades now, the cutting edge reform in education has been vouchers, which is a way of expanding the existing education entitlement by making it more portable and flexible. The main problem with vouchers as a vehicle for reform is that it misdiagnoses the problem as overly rigid government dependency. If the clients of school welfare feel they get no respect, putting them on a longer leash and adding variety to their diet may make them more content for a time, but it does nothing to address the deeper problem of government dependency. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It is well documented that every government that has subsidized private and religious schools, from Australia to France to Canada, has diminished their autonomy and blurred their distinction from state schooling. Vouchers offer private schools in America the same fate, even before the government slaps new regulations on participating schools. This is because the private schools that accept vouchers will no longer be owned by parents, but by the state. During a court challenge to a pilot voucher program in Cleveland, Ohio, a lawyer for the American Federation of Teachers recently provided a sneak peek of how parents and the schools they choose will be regarded under a voucher plan. In oral arguments, he characterized voucher-bearing parents as "inconsequential conduits" of state funds.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 To carry out your duty as a parent, you must own the means to produce the education for your children, by either contracting out or doing it yourself. "School choice" may make you a chooser but it won't make you an owner, any more than housing vouchers make you a homeowner. No government voucher frees you from dependence upon government. To rephrase Abe Lincoln, I'd prefer my welfare straight up, without the base alloy of self-delusion.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let us not, after all, mistake the appearance of a free market with reality. Voucher proponents contend that the creation of market conditions in education, such as parents' freedom to choose among schools, will bring about an actual market. Here is where some voucher proponents begin to resemble utopian socialists, who similarly promise that once the state owns everything and everyone has equal choices, the state will just melt away. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We may fairly ask when we can expect the melting to begin. Milton Friedman hopes that vouchers will lead to the repeal of compulsory attendance laws and the elimination of all government funding for education. He has never explained how we go from our current 88 percent rate of dependency on government up to 100 percent, then down to zero. Proposals to require parents to match the government's contribution to their voucher forget that subsidy stimulates dependency. Vouchers in any form will create an insatiable constituency for bigger and bigger subsidies.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I like to say that if I were advising the National Education Association on how to preserve and expand the government schooling monopoly (and didn't have a conscience), I would urge the following plan: Continue the pretense of opposition to vouchers (which fuels much of its support among conservatives), while embracing them strategically by softening genuine resistance. Wherever they pass, complain bitterly, then move in to regulate. Playwright, polemicist, and Fabian socialist George Bernard Shaw would have approved. In 1903, he wrote that "since more than half the children in [England] were in voluntary [privately funded] schools and could not be got out of them," they "should be fully financed by the State, and brought under its control."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Whereas the Fabians aimed to emasculate religious schools, voucher proponents will do it inadvertently, then feel bad about it. Some, I fear, would even consider it an acceptable loss. Witness the recent push in Congress for a federally funded voucher plan for families in the District of Columbia. After Senator Jim Jeffords, a liberal Republican from Vermont, blocked passage of a voucher bill that had already passed the House, negotiators sat down to work out a compromise. Bowing to the teachers unions, the Senate eventually voted to kill the voucher plan. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Nevertheless, the Senate did the right thing, albeit for the wrong reasons. Among other warts, the plan included a provision that required participating religious schools to provide written assurance that "funds received" under the subtitle "will not be used to pay the costs related to a religion class or a religious ceremony." Voucher proponents offered little apology for this egregious capitulation, and even less toleration of dissent from fellow conservatives. Critics of the D.C. voucher plan were scolded for being "purist" and failing to appreciate that politics "requires compromise."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course that's just the point: politics requires compromise. No matter how well a voucher is crafted, it will be modified and undermined before its passage. Even if a pristine voucher plan could pass with so-called regulatory firewalls for participating private schools, it will inevitably be amended later. But the more troubling lesson of the D.C. voucher debacle is that it may not be possible to concoct a voucher too heinous to win approval from its perennial boosters. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 In <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, Marvin Olasky reminds us of the worthy charitable traditions in America that have withered as government assumed their functions. Olasky shows that there was indeed help for the widow, orphan, and outsider before government welfare, that it worked and even uplifted, and that we can have it again. Education likewise flourished in America before government monopoly schooling. This history will help us imagine what education might look like in the 21st century without government at the helm.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Compulsory government schooling did not begin on a large scale in this country until the 1850s and 1860s. Yet early America was among the most literate nations in recorded history, according to Pierre DuPont DeNemours (1812), Alexis de Tocqueville (1835), and Michael Chevalier (1838). In 1776, Tom Paine's pamphlet "Common Sense" sold more than 500,000 copies in a nation of 2 million, many of whom were slaves or indentured servants! In 1818, Noah Webster estimated that more than 5 million copies of his Spelling Book had been sold to a population of less than 20 million.<p>

<b>A Better Way</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Proponents of vouchers say government help is needed to educate the poor. But there is a better way: privately funded vouchers, or precollege scholarships. Since the first program was started in 1991 by J. Patrick Rooney, the former chairman of Golden Rule Insurance Co., the precollege scholarship movement has ballooned to 27 programs serving more than 10,000 low-income children--all private dollars, all private schools. And the families of every one of these children, with an average income of $15,000 a year, pay a large portion of the cost of tuition. Precollege scholarships do two wonderful things at once: they bring hope to inner cities, and provide living, breathing examples of poor families breaking free from government subservience. Every child who leaves a government school for an independent school with help from an individual or business in his community represents another brick pulled out from the base of the Berlin Wall of government monopoly schooling.

<br>


<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Precollege scholarships completely fulfill in miniature the goal of fostering independence from government. Citizens help the needy in the community to attend the school of their choice. Such scholarships liberate families without coercion. They are flexible, replicable, efficient, and empowering. They enjoy broad bipartisan support, and, if marketed effectively, could develop the same tradition of giving enjoyed by the United Negro College Fund, the Red Cross, and the Salvation Army.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But wait, you say. Couldn't a government voucher be designed to work something like a precollege scholarship, including matching payments from families, few conditions, little or no oversight, and no regulatory encroachments? Well, as they say in <i>Wayne's World</i>: "It could happen!" But if it did, vouchers would represent the first nonintrusive, flexible, lean, voluntary, locally supported government program ever! More importantly, even if government could replicate the charitable and volunteer sector, why in heaven's name would we want it to? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Voucher proponents answer that precollege scholarships are nice, but we need to reach millions of children! Ah, yes, the reach argument. Hillary Clinton's health-care plan had reach. Stalin had reach. Mother Teresa settles for depth. And conservatives should likewise steadfastly reject the standard that measures the goodness of a thing by its capacity and reach. We must not be dime store planners, competing with liberals at the numbers game. Rather, let's insist that all virtue is personal, that the fruits of virtue aren't transferable or subject to collectivization, that the term "education system" is as much an oxymoron as "love policy."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	No doubt restoring the enterprise of learning to families and communities will take more than private scholarships. Two important developments are already directing us into the next millennium. The first is the rise of entrepreneurs and investors who see a vast emerging market about to be liberated from the clutches of 50 state school monopolies. This will move beyond mere contracting for buses and books, and into the main course of the market: the provision of education services. Education Alternatives, Inc., which contracts with government schools, has fallen on hard times, but Nobel Education Dynamics, an operator of for-profit K-12 schools, saw its stock value increase 277 percent in 1995.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Beyond bricks and mortar, there will be an increase in computer-aided and on-line learning. Multimedia learning will come into its own as the "telecosm" becomes a reality in the next decade. Tutoring services like Sylvan Learning could blossom into for-profit schools. Gifted mavericks like Marva Collins and the hundreds of teachers who have joined the breakaway American Association of Educators in Private Practice are blazing a trail for thousands more to follow. In February 1996, the respected investment house Lehman Brothers held its first annual Education Industry Conference, tempting attendees with the promise of ground-floor opportunities in a $600-billion industry. Just one educational equivalent of FedEx, which challenged the postal monopoly, will change everything.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A second key development will be a mass exodus of middle-class social conservatives from government schools. Christians must stop playing king-of-the-hill with liberals for control of Caesar's schools. Instead of lobbying the government for the right of children to keep Bibles tucked in their desks, we might consider building schools where teachers keep them on theirs. A hundred years ago, the Protestants used government schooling to gang up on the Catholics; for the past 30 years, the secularists have wrested control from the Protestants, and are lording it over them. Let's retire the bludgeon. Imagine the impact if Pat Robertson and James Dobson announced a goal of starting enough new schools to serve 5 million new children by the year 2000! Home schooling is already exploding, but one can only imagine how many more families would take back control if they had a choice they could afford and be comfortable with.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, there are some highly desirable and viable political actions worth pursuing, including the following abbreviated list:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Tax relief.</b> Taxes are to government schooling as blood is to a vampire. Funding for education must move from a hemorrhage to a trickle to a drop. Three-quarters of Americans do not have children in school. An increasing percentage of these will be older people, including many pensioners who own homes and pay school taxes. These good folks are being taxed down to cat food for a system they don't use, doesn't work, shouldn't exist, and churns out nasty kids with foul mouths and bad attitudes. At the other end, there are the 20- and 30-somethings, just starting to have families, and with fewer illusions about government deliverance than their Roosevelt-era grandparents and Johnson-era parents. These young families can't afford to buy a house or amass any savings and they know that their children don't have a prayer of thriving in the 21st-century job market with a government-school education. As we move forward, more and more people will demand to keep more of their own money.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scrap compulsory school-attendance laws.</b> The great engine of talent and money now powering vouchers across the country should switch tracks and pull an easier load for a change. Nobody likes getting clobbered over and over again, and repealing compulsory-attendance laws is a less-threatening and highly appealing initiative. Why force children who don't want to be in school to disrupt those who do? Since attendance laws had a negligible effect in increasing attendance in most states where they were initially passed (90 percent of people already went), we have no reason to expect a significant decline in the rolls upon their repeal. But it will deal a heavy blow to the power and prestige of the school monopolies (always a good thing), and begin to build political momentum for things like the repeal of property taxes to pay for schools. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Put the Feds to bed.</b> Lately there's been much talk from former federal education secretaries about abolishing the U.S. Department of Education. This is a fine thing, but it must be part of a larger mission to end the federal role in education. Let's not merely shovel its programs back to other federal departments whence they came. Let the U.S. government be as silent in the area of education as is the U.S. Constitution.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What I have sketched out will not be accomplished with sweeping measures but by the slow, gritty, and unseen work of millions. We must strive for a shining ideal, an arrangement for learning based not on force, but on love.<p><i><b>Douglas D. Dewey</b> is the president of the National Scholarship Center, a research and information clearinghouse on privately funded voucher programs in Washington, D.C.

<center><h2>A Chance To Pursue My Dreams:<br>
A Harvard student extols private school choice</h2></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

By the end of my freshman year at a public high school in Santa Barbara, California, I had had enough. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Enough of the lewd comments and harassment I encountered daily. Enough of watching students come to class stoned or drunk. And enough of the racial tension that culminated for me when I was physically threatened by a gang of Hispanic girls because I had white friends.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To make matters worse, no one at the school seemed to care about any of this. Administrators didn't protect students from harassment in the hallways. Teachers didn't reprimand the students who disrupted class. Few showed concern if a student flunked all of his courses. I went for weeks without attending class, but no teacher ever said a word and my parents never found out.I came very close to dropping out, which would not have surprised my teachers. I am the youngest of seven children, born to immigrant parents from rural Mexico. My father has a third-grade education, and my mother never attended school. They never learned to speak English. My older brothers did not attend college; my older sisters became pregnant at an early age and dropped out of high school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; If I had stayed in my public school, I would surely have lost all interest in education. But I was lucky to have parents who scrimped and saved to send me, beginning in my sophomore year, to a private school that emphasized competence and character. It was a turning point: I rediscovered my ardor for learning. I graduated with honors and I was admitted this fall as a transfer student to Harvard University.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What was it about Brighton Academy, a small private school in Grants Pass, Oregon, that helped turn me around? In a word: leadership. The faculty and administration were interested in producing not only good students, but good people. I was once again free to focus on academics because I was no longer wasting my energy living in fear of school.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	At my private school, adults weren't afraid to exercise authority in a sensitive yet firm manner, and for this they earned the students' respect. Teachers wouldn't tolerate tardiness, inappropriate dress, or disruption. When a student was caught with drugs, not only was he punished and his parents informed, but the administration addressed the entire student body about it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Our teachers emphasized discipline and character. They taught us not to capitulate to peer pressure, reminding us that it takes strength and individuality to stand for what one believes. School officials regularly rewarded good conduct, through public praise and student-of-the-month awards. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Our instructors were exceptional not only because they got to know us outside of school -- in our neighborhoods and churches,  and even at family picnics -- but because they were obviously committed to us as students. Brighton cannot afford to pay its teachers competitive salaries, and many teachers take, without complaint, outside jobs during the school year.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Contrary to many assumptions about private education, the student body at Brighton came from working-class and middle-class families. Parents held monthly rummage sales. Students took after-school jobs to help pay their tuition.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sadly, the most powerful lessons of my public school -- listen to peers, not parents; disrespect authority; learn not to care about learning -- directly undermined those I was taught at home. But my private school emphasized that parents are a child's primary moral teachers, and they did everything to support parents in this role. Parents were integrated into the school community via planning committees, monthly all-school meetings, student-teacher conferences, and invitations to all school functions.   <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I thank my teachers at this wonderful school who cared that I learned. Although they made less money than my public-school teachers, they awakened my love of learning, and they taught the principles -- integrity, honesty, courage -- that have enabled me to pursue my dreams.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

President Clinton will travel to the Philippines to attend the Leaders' Meeting of the forum for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) on November 24-25, 1996. There, he and other heads of government will chart the future of trans-Pacific trade and investment liberalization.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Clinton's vacillating trade policy, however, has undermined American leadership in promoting open markets around the world, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. At the APEC Leaders' Meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, on November 15, 1994, President Clinton and the other heads of government agreed to create a "free trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific."  They also pledged to implement this plan by no later than 2010 in APEC's developed members, such as the United States and Japan, and by 2020 in APEC's developing members, such as Chile, China, and Indonesia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since then, the Clinton Administration had made little progress toward that goal. In fact, the President's actions and trade policies over the past two years have dismayed America's trading partners in the Asia-Pacific region and dimmed the prospects for APEC trade and investment liberalization. These actions and policies include: (1) blocking Congress from reauthorizing fast track negotiating authority, (2) skipping the 1995 APEC Leaders' Meeting in Osaka, Japan, (3) failing to produce a credible U.S. action plan for APEC trade and investment liberalization, (4) pushing for managed trade with Japan, (5) dishonoring the American commitment to conclude World Trade Organization agreements to liberalize trade in certain services, (6) delaying the accession of Chile, an APEC member, to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and (7) failing to work with Congress to reform U.S. agricultural programs that harm other APEC members.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 18 economies that APEC encompasses are important to America's future.<sup>1</sup>  Together, APEC members have a gross domestic product (GDP) exceeding $13 trillion, or about one-half of the world's total output. APEC members account for 46 percent of the world's total merchandise trade. Indeed, the volume of U.S. trade with other APEC economies is staggering. In 1995, total U.S. two-way merchandise trade with APEC members was $872.4 billion or 65.7 percent of America's total two-way merchandise trade. Goods exports to APEC members provide paychecks to approximately 7.3 million American workers. Moreover, citizens of the U.S. and other APEC members are large investors in each other's economies. In 1995, U.S. direct investment in other APEC members was $225.4 billion or 31.7 percent of U.S. direct investment worldwide while direct investment by other APEC members in the U.S. was $172.5 billion or 30.7 percent of total foreign direct investment in the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clinton's dithering between liberalization and protectionism has been particularly damaging in Asia. Because America's commitment to free trade and investment with Asia appears to be waning, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad may be tempted to revive his dormant idea of an Asia-only trading bloc that excludes the United States. Until now, APEC's existence has prevented such a bloc from emerging. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Reaffirming America's commitment to free trade and investment and restoring consistency to U.S. trade policy toward Asia is an important priority for the next four years. In particular, the United States must leave no doubt among Asians about its commitment to APEC and its resolve to achieve a free trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific. Therefore, the President should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Ask Congress for fast track authority to negotiate trade and investment agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues.</b> Fast track is needed to present a substantive action plan for trade and investment liberalization in APEC, to participate in any future round of WTO negotiations, and to bring Chile into NAFTA.
<p>
<li><b>Participate fully in APEC's "concerted unilateralism" process.</b> Under concerted unilateralism, each APEC member prepares its own plan to liberalize trade and investment, with each plan then subject to peer review to help assure compliance in achieving the ultimate goal. At present, there are still too many differences among APEC members for formal trade negotiations to succeed. Concerted unilateralism allows APEC members to take small but concrete steps each year and to gain confidence in each other.
<p>
<li><b>Support Australia's initiative to harmonize existing free trade agreements within the Asia-Pacific region.</b>  These agreements are NAFTA, the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Agreement (CER), and the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). This action would enhance the prospects for broader trade and investment liberalization within APEC.
<p>
<li><b>Work with other APEC members in the WTO to complete the unfinished items from the Uruguay Round negotiations.</b> These include sector agreements to liberalize financial and basic telecommunications, and new negotiations to liberalize agricultural trade.
<p>
<li><b>Bring Chile into NAFTA by the end of 1997.</b> Since Chile belongs to APEC, other members see Chile's accession as a test of whether the United States is willing to make a free trade and investment agreement with a developing country that is not on America's border. Although Mexico joined NAFTA in 1994, Asians feel that this is a special case because of Mexico's proximity to the U.S. Chile's prompt accession to NAFTA would help Washington to regain the trade and investment liberalization initiative in the Asia-Pacific region. 
<p>
<li><b>Invite other Latin American countries, starting with Argentina and Peru, to join APEC.</b> The U.S. should press APEC to lift its moratorium on new members. Chile and Mexico are already APEC members. Adding other Latin American countries such as Argentina and Peru, which have demonstrated their willingness to open to APEC, would swing the balance of power within APEC away from the Asian "go slow" group of China, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia and accelerate trade and investment liberalization.
<p>
<li><b>Ask Congress to eliminate the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs</b> that cost American consumers and taxpayers more than $10 billion every year and undermine U.S. credibility on trade liberalization with many APEC members.
</ul>

<b>THE FORUM FOR ASIA-PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION (APEC)</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The forum for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation is the institutional link between the economies of the Americas and Asia. Fearing a breakdown in the global trading system into competing regional trading blocs, former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke in November 1989 invited trade ministers from countries in East and Southeast Asia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States to meet in Canberra. There they established APEC as a regional forum for consultation about international economic issues. Since then, APEC has evolved rapidly and acquired a broad mandate for liberalizing trade and investment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
APEC's transformation began at the Ministers' Meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, in September 1992. There, APEC established a small secretariat, which opened in Singapore in February 1993. It also created the Eminent Persons Group, an advisory body composed of senior economists and other experts, to chart APEC's future.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The next major step occurred in 1993 when President Clinton added a Leaders' Meeting to the annual Ministers' Meeting. At this first Leaders' Meeting held on November 20, 1993, on Blake Island near Seattle, Washington, President Clinton and the other heads of government adopted an Economic Vision Statement setting as APEC's goal "the progressive development of a community of Asia-Pacific economies with free and open trade and investment."<sup>2</sup>  The leaders charged the Eminent Persons Group "to present further more specific proposals on how the recommended long-term vision might be realized."<sup>3</sup>  In response, the Eminent Persons Group, chaired by C. Fred Bergsten, a former U.S. Treasury official and Director of the Washington-based Institute for International Economics, issued a report on August 30, 1994, calling for an APEC-wide free trade and investment area.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Accepting the Eminent Persons Group's challenge, President Suharto of Indonesia, who was then APEC's chairman, forged a historic agreement at the next APEC Leaders' Meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, on November 15, 1994. In the Bogor Declaration of Common Resolve, President Clinton and the other heads of government agreed to create a "free trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific."  They also decided to implement this plan by no later than 2010 for developed economies such as the United States or Japan and no later than 2020 for developing economies such as Chile, China, or Indonesia.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the Leaders' Meetings in Osaka, Japan, on November 19, 1995, APEC adopted a process known as "concerted unilateralism" as the means of erecting a free trade and investment area. Under this process, instead of negotiating a formal trade agreement such as NAFTA, each member must propose its own individual action plan for realizing the common goal of free trade and investment. Each plan is subject to peer review and pressure to prevent any shirking from the ultimate goal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the Osaka Action Agenda communiqu, the leaders directed their trade ministers to prepare concrete and substantive individual actions plans that would be vetted in a series of APEC meetings in 1996. The leaders directed APEC's Chairman, President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines, to assemble these plans and meld them into a comprehensive Manila Action Plan for APEC. This plan could then be approved at the APEC Ministers' Meeting on November 22-23, 1996, in Manila and the Leaders' Meeting on November 24-25, at Subic Bay. The leaders also set January 1, 1997, as the target date to begin implementing the Manila Action Plan for APEC. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite these agreements, there remain divisions within APEC. An Asian group, composed of China, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia, advocates a "go slow" approach to trade and investment liberalization. This group wants APEC to focus on small, but practical measures to facilitate trade, such as developing a common visa for businessmen traveling in the region or harmonizing product standards and professional licensing during the next few years. This group and some countries from the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) oppose expanding APEC membership to India and other countries in Latin America. They lobbied other APEC members and won a three-year moratorium on new members that began in 1994.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Another group, composed of Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore, wants to emphasize rapid trade and investment liberalization among APEC members. This group is more willing to expand APEC's membership.

<p>
<b>WHY APEC IS GOOD FOR AMERICA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Achieving APEC's goal of a free trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific would benefit the American people enormously. In February 1996, the Australian Industry Commission published the most comprehensive study to date on the economic effects of APEC trade liberalization. The Commission found that comprehensive free trade (both goods and services) and investment within APEC would increase real GDP by 0.7 percent or $70 billion by 2010 in the United States, Canada, and Mexico above and beyond any gains from Uruguay Round liberalization. Likewise, total exports from North America would rise by an additional 18.4 percent above any increase due to the Uruguay Round. Moreover, if APEC trade and investment liberalization were combined with trade facilitation measures, real GDP in North America would rise faster -- 1.5 percent or $140 billion by 2010.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Moreover, APEC not only promotes trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific but also serves other American interests. For example, APEC:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Promotes trade and investment liberalization not only across the Pacific but in the rest of the world as well.</b> APEC is committed to the concept of "open regionalism."  This means that APEC seeks not only to eliminate trade and investment barriers within APEC, but also to lower trade barriers progressively between APEC and the rest of world. APEC liberalization is not an alternative to multilateral liberalization through the World Trade Organization. Indeed, APEC fully supports the WTO and all of the Uruguay Round Agreements, and favors a new round of WTO negotiations to progress as rapidly as possible toward global free trade and investment. However, APEC acknowledges that regional groups of like-minded countries may move far faster toward free trade and investment than can the WTO with its diverse global membership. Thus, regional groups may provide both a model and an inspiration for trade and investment liberalization to the rest of the world. In this sense, parallel regional and multilateral trade liberalization initiatives are mutually reinforcing. Indeed, the emergence of APEC as a regional trade organization in 1993 is widely credited with bringing the Uruguay Round negotiations to a successful conclusion.
<p>
Once again in 1996, APEC is expected to use its influence to promote multilateral liberalization by endorsing the proposed Information Technology Agreement. Suggested by Japan and the United States, this agreement would eliminate all tariffs on computers, semiconductors, software, and telecommunications equipment by 2000. It will be presented for approval to WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore on December 9-12, 1996.
<p>
<li><b>Prevents the emergence of an Asia-only trading bloc.</b> Some Asian leaders, especially Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, have advocated forming an Asia-only trading bloc that would focus primarily on liberalizing trade within Asia rather than across the Pacific Ocean. In 1990, Mahathir proposed that China, Japan, South Korea, and the ASEAN countries form an East Asia Economic Group (EAEG). Although Beijing was supportive, both Tokyo and Seoul feared that an EAEG would exacerbate trade tensions and undermine security cooperation with the United States, and they joined the Bush Administration in opposing it. Failing to garner Japanese or South Korean support, Mahathir scaled back his proposal to establishing a less formal East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC). Eventually, the Clinton Administration and other APEC governments agreed to establish an EAEC as a discussion group within APEC in 1993. Since the Bogor Declaration in 1994, APEC has been the main focus for trade and investment liberalization efforts in Asia. Talk about an Asia-only trading bloc has died off. However, if APEC trade and investment liberalization should falter, nationalists in Asia could press once again to convert the EAEC into an Asia-only trading bloc.
<p>
An Asia-only trading bloc with Asia would be very detrimental to American interests. U.S. two-way merchandise trade with Asia exceeded $403 billion in 1995. Goods exports to Asia supported more than 3.8 million jobs in the U.S. An inward-looking Asia-only trading bloc could reduce American exports to Asia and threaten the paychecks of many American workers. Moreover, an Asia-only trading bloc that excludes the United States likely would reduce the willingness of Congress and the American people to support an active political role and a visible military presence in the region. An American withdrawal could threaten peace and prosperity in Asia. 
<p>
<li><b>Helps foster greater trust and cooperation between China and Taiwan.</b> APEC admits economies, not countries as members. By skirting the question of political sovereignty, this technical distinction allowed China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan (as "Chinese Taipei") to join APEC in 1991 as separate members. Thus, APEC is the only major international organization to which both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan belong.<sup>6</sup>  Given the current tensions, APEC provides an important bridge for peaceful cooperation between China and Taiwan.
</ul>
<p>
<b>WHY AMERICAN INFLUENCE IN APEC IS WANING</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Clinton's vacillating trade policy has diminished American influence over the direction of trade and investment in APEC. America's trading partners in the Americas and Asia welcomed many of the Clinton Administration's trade and investment initiatives during its first two years in office. Asians cheered President Clinton's decision to hold the first APEC Leaders' Meeting and to support the creation of an APEC free trade and investment area. Moreover, Asians also applauded when President Clinton:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Won congressional approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).</b> President Clinton signed implementing legislation into law on December 8, 1993, that let APEC member Mexico join the existing Free Trade Agreement between Canada, another APEC member, and the U.S.
<p>
<li><b>Won congressional approval for the Uruguay Round Agreements.</b> President Clinton signed implementing legislation into law on December 8, 1994. APEC strongly supported these agreements and the establishment of the WTO.
<p>
<li><b>Hosted the Summit of the Americas</b> in Miami, Florida, on December 8-11, 1994. There, President Clinton and the heads of government of all the countries in the Americas except Cuba signed a Declaration of Principles. This declaration committed the United States and the 33 other countries to creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005. 
<p>
<li><b>Invited Chile, an APEC member, to begin negotiations to join NAFTA.</b> Following the Summit of the Americas, President Clinton, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, and Mexican President Carlos Salinas met with Chilean President Eduardo Frei. There, they committed to help Chile join NAFTA by 1997.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In contrast to praiseworthy initiatives such as APEC, FTAA, NAFTA, and the Uruguay Round during his first two years in office, President Clinton began responding to protectionist voices within his own political coalition in early 1995. Since then, the Clinton Administration has veered away from trade and investment liberalization. In a trade policy "U-turn," President Clinton has: 
<p><ul>
<li><b>Blocked Congress from reauthorizing fast track negotiating authority by demanding that controversial environmental and labor standards be added to all future trade and investment agreements.</b> President Clinton let fast track authority for negotiating new trade and investment agreements expire in 1994. Under fast track authority, trade and investment agreement negotiated by the President are submitted to Congress for a straight up-or-down vote; Congress may not amend any portion of proposed agreement before voting on it. For the last two years, the Clinton Administration has insisted that any bill reauthorizing fast track must allow the President to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues.
<p>
This position has caused fast track to stall in Congress. Republican leaders fear that environmental and labor rules in trade agreements could be misused to protect certain industries. They offered to pass a "clean" fast track bill without the authority to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues, but the Administration rejected this approach. Without fast track authority, no country will enter into serious trade and investment liberalization negotiations with the United States.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Skipped the APEC Leaders' Meeting in 1995.</b> President Clinton did not attend the APEC Leaders' Meeting in Osaka, Japan, on November 19, 1995, because of the budget stalemate with Congress. Although Vice President Al Gore did go in Clinton's place, this decision raised questions among the other leaders about the Clinton Administration's commitment to APEC.
<p>
<li><b>Failed to produce a credible APEC action plan.</b> The lack of fast track authority has slowed the progress toward creating an APEC free trade and investment area. Without fast track authority, the Clinton Administration was unable to propose any new trade and investment liberalization initiatives in America's APEC action plan. The Administration's action plan is merely a restatement of trade liberalization commitments made in the Uruguay Round Agreements. Because of the inability of the United States to make any new commitments, other APEC members were reluctant to make substantive commitments in their own action plans. Thus, when the action plans were presented for review at a meeting in Christchurch, New Zealand, on July 15, 1996, APEC trade ministers were so embarrassed by how few trade and investment liberalization commitments were offered that they sheepishly agreed to rework and resubmit their action plans. However, it is unclear what additional liberalization commitments other APEC members are willing to make if the United States still has nothing to offer. 
<p>
<li><b>Pushed for managed trade with Japan.</b>  The Clinton Administration attempted to impose managed trade policies on Japan in the auto and automotive parts dispute of 1995. The Clinton Administration also wanted to renew an agreement with Japan establishing import targets for semiconductors in 1996. This strategy alarmed free trade advocates in Canberra, Ottawa, Santiago, Singapore, and Wellington. Although Tokyo and Washington ultimately reached an auto and automotive parts agreement, which avoided mandatory quotas, in 1995 and agreed to drop import targets from the semiconductor agreement in 1996, Clinton's approach to the conflict alienated other APEC members. Consequently, American influence over the direction of trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region has been effectively diminished.
<p>
<li><b>Dishonored the American commitment to liberalize trade in services through the WTO.</b> APEC members are concerned that the Clinton Administration's withdrawal from WTO negotiations to liberalize trade in financial services and basic telecommunications may foreshadow unilateral actions to open financial services and telecommunications markets in Asia. One of the Uruguay Round Agreements, the General Agreement on Trade in Services or GATS, establishes a general framework for liberalizing trade in services and mandates a timetable for reaching sector agreements covering financial services and basic telecommunications.<sup>8</sup>  During the last two years, the Clinton Administration walked out of WTO negotiations for both sectors literally hours before agreements were scheduled to be concluded because some American firms were dissatisfied with the market liberalization offers from certain Asian countries. For financial services, the Administration rejected the offers of India, Japan, South Korea, and certain ASEAN countries and suspended negotiations on June 29, 1995.<sup>9</sup>  For basic telecommunications, India and the ASEAN countries once again failed to produce acceptable offers so the Clinton Administration left WTO negotiations on April 30, 1996. Consequently, the WTO pushed back the deadlines for achieving permanent financial services and basic telecommunications agreements to December 31, 1997, and February 15, 1997, respectively.
<p>
<li><b>Delayed Chile's accession to NAFTA.</b> Asians are closely monitoring Chile's accession to NAFTA as test of U.S. resolve. Asians reason that if President Clinton cannot bring a small developing country, whose gross domestic product is 0.9 percent of the size of the U.S. economy, into NAFTA, the United States will not be able to fulfill its APEC free trade and investment commitments with much larger developing economies of the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, or Thailand.
<p>
Chile will not begin negotiations to join NAFTA until President Clinton secures fast track authority from Congress. The Administration's stubborn refusal to compromise with Congress on environmental and labor standards issues has effectively kept Chile out of NAFTA. However, Chile is not waiting on the sidelines for President Clinton and Congress to act. Instead, Santiago is exploring other options for trade and investment liberalization. Chile already has a bilateral free trade agreement with one APEC member, Mexico, and is discussing possible free trade and investment agreements with two other APEC members, Canada and New Zealand.
<p>
<li><b>Failed to eliminate trade-distorting American agricultural policies.</b> Agriculture is a major issue for a number of APEC members, especially Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Thailand.<sup>10</sup>  On balance, these APEC members were pleased with the passage of the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act (FAIR) in 1996. This act gives U.S. wheat, feed grain, rice, and cotton farmers fixed, but declining subsidies through seven-year transition contracts and terminates production controls on wheat, feed grains, rice, and cotton. However, the FAIR Act was disappointing because it modified dairy and sugar programs only slightly and left export subsidy programs intact. The dairy and sugar programs cost American consumers $9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively each year in higher prices, and the dairy program will add $1.6 billion to federal expenditures over the next five years. Moreover, these agricultural programs depress world commodity prices by blocking farm imports into the United States or subsidizing farm exports to other markets. Lower world prices hurt farmers in APEC agricultural exporting countries such as Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Thailand.
<p>
The United States shares a common interest with many APEC members in achieving free trade in agricultural products in APEC. Large potential markets for American farm production are only partially open in Japan and Taiwan and remain closed in China and South Korea. Indeed, the Australia Industrial Commission found that nearly one-third of the gains of APEC trade liberalization above and beyond any gains from the Uruguay Round are due to liberalizing the agricultural sector. Excluding agriculture, the gains to the United States and the rest of North America would fall by about $23 billion or 0.3 percent of gross domestic product by 2010.11   When the potential gains to the U.S. from free trade in agricultural commodities are so large, the agricultural exporting countries in APEC cannot understand why the Clinton Administration did not press Congress to eliminate the dairy, export subsidy, and sugar program when it considered the FAIR bill. They are concerned that President Clinton will not fight for free trade in agricultural products.
</ul><p>
<b>RESTORING AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN APEC</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration's zigzagging between trade liberalization and protectionism has undermined confidence in American economic leadership and threatened the progress toward open markets in the Asia-Pacific region. This loss of American prestige and influence has been especially evident in APEC. President Clinton organized APEC's first Leaders' Meeting in 1993 and then worked for adoption of the Bogor Declaration in 1994. Since then, the Clinton Administration has placed little emphasis on APEC, and as a result the momentum toward APEC trade and investment liberalization has slowed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An Asia-Pacific free trade and investment area remains in America's interest. But this objective may not be achieved unless the United States can exert more leadership in APEC. To do this, President Clinton should:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ask Congress for fast track authority to negotiate trade and investment agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues.</b> The Administration needs fast track authority to offer a substantive action plan for trade and investment liberalization at APEC, to bring Chile into NAFTA, to harmonize NAFTA with other regional free trade agreements, and to commence a new WTO negotiating round. The President should drop his insistence that authority to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues must be included in the fast track legislation. Environmental and labor standards issues may have an international dimension, but they should be addressed in separate negotiations on their own merits. 
<p>
<li><b>Participate fully in APEC's "concerted unilateralism" process.</b> It is important to strengthen the APEC process through a building block approach. Concerted unilateralism allows members to take small but concrete steps each year toward APEC's ultimate goal of free trade and investment by 2020. More traditional negotiations eventually will be necessary to achieve APEC's goal of a free trade and investment area. However, there are too many differences among APEC members right now for the negotiations to succeed. Only after APEC members gain confidence in each other over the next few years will a more formal negotiating process be likely to succeed.
<p>
<li><b>Support Australia's initiative to harmonize existing free trade agreements within the Asia-Pacific region.</b> At upcoming APEC meetings, Canberra will urge members to harmonize existing free trade agreements such as NAFTA, the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement between Australia and New Zealand (CER), and the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). The President should support this Australian initiative. It is a practical step toward trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific, and will make the goal of an APEC free trade and investment agreement much easier to achieve.
<p>
<li><b>Work with other APEC members in the World Trade Organization to complete the unfinished items from the Uruguay Round negotiations.</b> APEC is strongly committed to implementing fully the Uruguay Round Agreements and strengthening the WTO. At the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Singapore in December 9-12, 1996, the Clinton Administration should press other WTO members to complete the unfinished items from the Uruguay Round. Washington must work with other APEC members to reach agreements on liberalizing trade in financial services and basic telecommunications services by 1997. Moreover, Washington and other agricultural exporters in APEC must work together to prepare for the new negotiations on liberalizing agricultural trade that are scheduled to begin in 1999. 
<p>
<li><b>Bring Chile into NAFTA by the end of 1997.</b> Since Chile belongs to APEC, other members -- especially the ASEAN countries -- are looking at Chile's accession as a test of whether the United States is willing to make a free trade and investment agreement with a developing country. Chile's prompt accession to NAFTA would demonstrate American resolve to achieve an APEC free trade and investment area.
<p>
<li><b>Invite other Latin American countries, starting with Argentina and Peru, to join APEC.</b> The Clinton Administration has mistakenly opposed adding new members to APEC. Instead, the U.S. should be pressing APEC to lift its moratorium on new members. Adding Latin American countries, which have demonstrated their willingness to open their markets and implement a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), would swing the balance of power within APEC away from the Asian "go slow" group of China, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia. Argentina and Peru have expressed an interest in APEC membership and would push APEC toward more rapid liberalization. 
<p>
The six ASEAN countries that currently belong to APEC will sponsor their new member, Vietnam, for APEC membership after the moratorium expires in 1997. This creates an opportunity for the U.S. to help Argentina and Peru join also. President Clinton should offer to trade U.S. support for Vietnam's APEC membership in exchange for Asian support for Argentina's and Peru's candidacy.
<p>
<li><b>Ask Congress to eliminate the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs.</b> With the passage of the FAIR Act, the U.S. began winding down many economically irrational programs. However, the dairy, export subsidy, and sugar programs survived largely intact. These programs simultaneously raise U.S. consumer prices, cost American taxpayers billions of dollars annually, and decrease world prices for agricultural commodities. Eliminating these programs will improve American relations with a number of APEC members. The President can use this good will as negotiating leverage with the ASEAN countries to pressure them to open their services markets to American providers.
</ul>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Expanding trade and investment with the fast growing economies of Asia and Latin America is a vital American interest. APEC, which is committed to creating a "free trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific" by no later than 2020, is the institutional means through which the U.S. can realize this objective. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

President Clinton had a number of major accomplishments in trade and investment liberalization during his first two years in office. Since then, however, the President has blocked Congress from reauthorizing fast track negotiating authority, failed to pursue promising trade initiatives, flirted with protectionism, and dishonored U.S. trade commitments. This vacillating trade policy has dismayed America's trading partners, undermined American leadership, and endangered the prospects for APEC trade and investment liberalization.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Clinton must regain the initiative and restore American leadership for international trade and investment liberalization. He must take concrete actions to reassure trading partners in the Asia-Pacific that U.S. remains committed to APEC. These steps include securing fast track authority and offering a credible U.S. action plan for trade and investment liberalization in APEC. Presidential deeds, not rhetorical phrases, are needed to keep APEC on track toward its free trade and investment goal.

<li>    Industry Commission, <i>Impact of APEC's Free Trade Commitment</i> (Canberra: Commonwealth of Australia, February 1996), pp. 13, 15, 24. To facilitate trade, APEC economies have pledged to: simplify and harmonize customs procedures; ensure the transparency of product standards, align national product standards with international ones, and achieve mutual recognition of product testing; introduce or maintain adequate competition policies to prevent domestic firms from colluding to exclude their foreign rivals from their home markets; liberalize government procurement procedures; and promote the transparency of other economic regulations and eliminate distortions from overly restrictive or discriminatory regulations. <p>
<li>    "Chinese Taipei" and Hong Kong participate in all APEC functions except Leaders' Meetings, which are considered to have a political as well as an economic character.<p>
<li>    If Congress were allowed to amend trade agreements, it would likely accept the concessions that foreign governments made to reach a deal while voting to reject U.S. concessions. Such an outcome is obviously unacceptable to any foreign government. To encourage foreign governments to negotiate trade agreements with the United States, Congress devised the fast track procedure to force itself to accept or reject trade agreements as a whole. <p>
<li>    Basic telecommunications refers to long distance and international services. "Value-added" telecommunications services such as electronic mail, voice mail, on-line information and data base retrieval, and electronic data interchange are covered by a separate sector agreement.<p>
<li>     After the U.S. withdrawal, the other WTO members agreed to an interim financial services agreement that expires on December 31, 1997.<p>
<li>     Under the leadership of Australia, these APEC members along with Brazil, Colombia, Fiji, Hungary, and Uruguay formed the Cairns Group of agricultural exporting countries in 1986 to promote free trade in farm products. The Cairns Group succeeded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in winning the first multilateral agreement to liberalize trade in agricultural products.<p>

<h2>Choosing the Right Tax Advisor</h2>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<font size="+2">A</font>fter surviving the horror of yet another tax season, many people  daunted by 
the prospects of repeating the same performance next April 15  resolve finally to put 
their personal finances in order.  But some drag their feet, because they dont realize how 
much help experts like accounts and tax attorneys can provide.  Other people dont know 
where to turn for professional guidance.

	<p>One woman, the president of a New York City-based management consulting 
firm, stated the problem succinctly: "I didn't think I was taking advantage of all the tax 
breaks I was entitled to.  And I wanted someone to show me how to make money on my 
money, instead of just paying over half to the government."

	<p>Like many people, she eventually found her accountant through referrals from 
friends and business associates.  She interviewed about five CPA's before making a final 
selection, and chose her current accountant because "he works with a lot of people at 
about my income level who own small businesses." In addition, she felt "the chemistry 
was right."

	<p>This woman's organized selection process can serve as a model for people in the 
market for accountants and tax lawyers.

	<p>CPA's provide a variety of services, from tax return preparation to financial 
planning to bookkeeping.  So before you begin shopping around for a practitioner, ask 
yourself this question:  What do I want an accountant to do for me?

	<p>If you need help organizing your personal finances, an accountant should be able 
to advise you on whether to rent or purchase a home, how much life and property 
insurance you need, and how to structure your investment portfolio, in addition to telling 
you how to pay a minimum amount of income tax.

	<p>As a generalist, a CPA can help you select specialists in narrower fields.  For 
example, he will work with attorneys, to help draft wills and trust agreements, and to put 
an estate plan into effect.  He will also work with stockbrokers, to help design a portfolio 
that makes the most of taxwise investments like tax-exempt mutual funds.

	<p>Do you need an accountant to prepare your tax return?  While some people can't 
justify the fee and prefer to follow the IRS instructions themselves, others take a different 
view.  A good accountant sees planning opportunities in the data gathered for a return.  
Looking over Schedule D, which lists securities transactions, an accountant might 
recommend donating highly appreciated securities as a way to maximize charitable 
deductions.

	<p>Look for someone who has sound business judgment as well as technical 
expertise.  And seek out a professional who offers tax planning advice throughout the 
year, not just at tax time.

	<p>Doctors, lawyers, small business owners and others with specialized needs are 
well advised to seek out accountants with experience and technical expertise in their 
particular areas.  Problems tend to repeat themselves, and accountants who specialize 
tend to keep current with the latest developments in their fields.

	<p>Expect to pay from $150 to $1,000 or more when an accountant prepares your tax 
return.  For consultation and planning, CPA's generally charge hourly rates.  Tax 
preparation fees may be deductible.  Consultation fees may also be deductible, depending 
on the service.

	<p>Tax lawyers are more expensive -- they generally charge higher hourly fees.  But 
they can save money for taxpayers with unusually complicated tax situations, for 
example, someone who has overlap between his complex business and personal tax 
matters.

	<p>Some people hire tax lawyers for advice in connection with a particular situation:  
to handle a divorce, to prepare an estate plan or to represent them in an IRS dispute.  
Select a tax attorney on the same basis as you choose an accountant -- by reputation and 
recommendation, with an eye to particular specialities.

	<p>Advisors who are both CPA's and attorneys can offer one-stop shopping.  They 
can work out an estate plan, for instance, and then draft the will and the trust agreements 
needed to carry out the plan.

	<h3>How to Conduct the Interview.</h3>
<p>
	Like most professionals, accountants and tax lawyers are best found through 
recommendations.  As you gather names, ask your friends and business associates exactly 
what they likeand donn't likeabout their advisors.  Find out whether they are easily 
accessible and whether they return telephone calls quickly.  Most advisors don't charge 
for an initial interview.  When you go in for the interview, ask these questions:
<p>
<ul>
	<li>How do you determine fees?
	(When the advisor charges an hourly rate, ask for a time estimate for the 
	job.)

	<p><li>What exactly will you do for the money?

	<p><li>How much time will you spend with me, doing planning and 
consultation?

	<p><li>Are you available only during tax season, or will you work with me 
	throughout the year?

	<p><li>Who will actually handle the work, you or your assistant?  (If an 
associate will be responsible for your account, make sure to find out 
his qualifications and his fee schedule.  Will you feel comfortable 
working with him?)

	<p><li>What are your areas of expertise?

	<p><li>How will you keep me up to date on the latest tax developments?

	<p><li>Does your office have microcomputer capabilities?  (Some advisors can 
do time-consuming what if planning with computer programs that 
instantly give them the results of a large number of hypothetical tax 
scenarios.)
</ul>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The recent growth of the Internet has spurred demand to make information on Congress readily available electronically. At the same time, newly elected House and Senate leaders have pledged to continue the significant reforms that made the 104th Congress more open and responsive to the public than its predecessors. The 105th Congress should marry internal reform and external electronic information efforts by establishing rules and procedures through a Congressional Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to guarantee that basic legislative information is available electronically. By taking the initiative in placing all disclosable information on the Internet, Congress could avoid the contentious process of specific requests for materials as well as the necessarily more complex freedom of information procedures established for the executive branch. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress already has acted to place information on line with enormous success. In 1995, Congress established <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov">THOMAS</a>, the Library of Congress's on-line legislative information service, which has been accessed more than 35 million times in just 22 months of operation. Another agency of the federal government, the Government Printing Office, manages the GPO Access system, which features 58 information databases produced by the federal government. Since December 1995, GPO Access has distributed an average of 2 million documents electronically each month.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Individual offices have also taken steps to make information available electronically. Ninety-four <a href="http://www.senate.gov">Senators</a> have World Wide Web home pages, which feature text and graphics, as do 213 of the <a href="http://www.house.gov">House's</a> 435 members. Electronic mail has facilitated communication with congressional offices; 38 percent of all House members and 82 percent of Senators now have e-mail addresses. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U. S. House of Representatives Task Force on Committee Review has recommended that Congress's open door policy be extended to include increasing public access to committee documents over the Internet. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Key materials that the House Task Force recommended be placed on the Internet include: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>Amendments to bills
<li>Committee and subcommittee prints
<li>Committee and subcommittee reports
<li>Oversight plans and activities.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In mid-July, Representative Rick White (R-WA) introduced H. Res. 478, which would incorporate the Task Force recommendations into the Rules for the House of Representatives. Likewise, through its "Operation Daylight," the U.S. Senate has sought to use information technology to publicize its activities more extensively. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both H. Res. 478 and Operation Daylight would do much to bring the day-to-day workings of Congress to the on-line public. Congress should broaden these procedural reforms by creating a Congressional FOIA, encompassing all of the information which Congress already makes available to the public. In addition to the committee documents detailed by the House task force for inclusion on the Internet, Congress should add issue briefs, spending reports, and financial and lobbying disclosure documents. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Through key institutional and procedural reforms, the 104th Congress sought to unmask and dismantle the network of liberal special interests that ran Capitol Hill for decades. A Congressional Freedom of Information Act would complete and confirm the move toward open access to Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Providing citizens outside of Washington with the means to closely examine and actively monitor the work of their elected representatives would do more to foster openness and prevent back room politics than any other single reform. The 30 million American families with personal computers would be able to use the Internet to observe more closely the activities of Congress and their particular representatives; other citizens may take advantage of the numerous possibilities for Internet access at work and at public and university libraries to find timely information on current legislation that may affect their lives. Overall, these changes would make our democratic system stronger and more responsive to the average citizen.
<p>
<b>CONGRESSIONAL REFORM IN THE 104th CONGRESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Heeding the public cry to "clean up Congress" in the aftermath of the House bank, bookkeeping, and post office scandals, Members of the 104th Congress took office in January 1994 determined to reform the institution. The House and Senate cut their budgets, reduced committee staff, eliminated perks, banned most gifts to Members, applied laws imposed on the private sector to itself, required lobbyists to register and disclose their activities, and imposed term limits on committee chairmen. The House also overhauled its committee system, once a haven for pork-barrel politics and back room deals. Congress's move to bring itself on line in the age of the information superhighway was an important, albeit unheralded, part of these changes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 104th Congress transformed itself into a more open and responsive body in part by affording Americans new and quicker channels of access to, as well as new sources of information from, their elected representatives. The increased use of electronic mail affords the public a new opportunity to comment on legislation currently under consideration; 38 percent of all House members and 82 percent of Senators now have e-mail addresses. As of early November 1996, 94 Senators and 213 House members have World Wide Web home pages. Likewise, congressional committees have posted information on line as part of their open door efforts. Eighteen House committees have home pages, with the remaining two scheduled to go on line within the year. Eight of the Senate's seventeen committees have home pages.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most significantly, House and Senate leaders have made much federal legislative information freely accessible to constituents through the Internet. In January 1994, congressional leadership brought the Library of Congress THOMAS system on line. As a result, some bill texts, the <i>Congressional Record Index</i>, bill summaries, and legislative status updates are readily available, free of charge, to the Internet-using public. THOMAS has been an enormous success: It was consulted nearly 14 million times in its first year of operation and more than 21 million times in the first ten months of 1996 alone. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, the GPO Access system went on line in December 1995 to provide access to 58 federal government databases, including the <i>Congressional Record</i>. On average, users download two million documents a month from the service free of charge. Among the most useful Web sites on GPO Access is the home page for the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigative arm. The GAO home page offers full-text searchable files of reports on major rules by federal agencies, GAO reports, testimony, policy and guidelines, comptroller general decisions, and bid protest regulations. In addition, the home page includes a direct link to GAO FraudNet, allowing Internet users to report evidence of fraud and abuse. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1995 Congressional Accountability Act required Congress to comply with legislation covering private workplaces. It excluded the Freedom of Information Act from its list of covered laws, however, as the FOIA does not apply to the private sector. Enacted in 1966 and amended several times since, the FOIA requires executive branch agencies to make many kinds of documents available to citizens, scholars, journalists, and others interested in government activity and statistical information. Unfortunately, compliance with this law has been characterized by excessive delays, and, in some cases, outright neglect. One major problem is that the FOIA has impact only after individuals request information from a government agency. The FOIA process begins with an often controversial decision about whether the requested information is eligible to be released to the public.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress recently passed an amendment called the Electronic Freedom of Information Act, requiring the executive branch to make greater use of the Internet in responding to requests for information. A huge advantage of electronic disclosure is that an agency can take the initiative to determine what information should be disclosed and make it available rather than waiting for citizens to ask. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress should establish similar open information procedures for itself. By starting with electronic disclosure through the Internet, Congress can avoid much of the contention and controversy that has characterized the executive branch experience with the FOIA.
<p>
<b>HOUSE TASK FORCE ON COMMITTEE REVIEW RECOMMENDATIONS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress already is considering additional steps to increase on-line access to information about the congressional process. The House Task Force on Committee Review, chaired by Representative David Dreier (R-CA), has called for significant House rule changes for the 105th Congress to assure greater public access to key committee documents. These recommendations were largely incorporated in H. Res. 478, introduced by Representative Rick White. In particular, H. Res. 478 would require House committees to place important legislative documents on line, including committee and subcommittee prints of bills, amendments, meeting transcripts, reports on legislation, and oversight plans and activity reports. At low marginal cost and with great efficiency of dissemination, these measures would improve public access to documents and information that previously had been the domain of congressional staffers and influence peddlers. Increased public access would help level the playing field between ordinary citizens and high-powered lobbyists, whose ability to obtain inside information often enables them to influence legislation. The Senate Rules and Administration Committee is considering similar steps as part of Operation Daylight.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H. Res. 478 would require that the following information be made available on the Internet:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Committee and subcommittee prints of bills and marks (when introduced or given to Members for markups).</b> Currently, citizens can read copies of bills that have been introduced in the House or the Senate via THOMAS or GPO Access. But bills almost always are transformed during committee or subcommittee scrutiny. Versions of bills to be considered by committees, termed "chairman's marks," often are not available to the public until after committees have acted on them. 
<p>
<li><b>Committee amendments to bills (as soon as technically feasible).</b> Amendments can fundamentally alter a bill. While average citizens may be able to review and comment upon the on original version of legislation, they usually will be unaware of how profoundly it can be changed by amendments. Until amendments to bills are made widely available, Washington lobbyists will continue to have the opportunity to review amendments and to urge changes before the broader public has a similar opportunity. 
<p>
<li><b>Committee and subcommittee reports (when filed with the Clerk of the House or the Secretary of the Senate). </b> Even though bills may be available via Internet, they are likely to be incomprehensible to the non-lawyer. Committee and subcommittee reports help to translate technical language into comprehensible English. Such reports also offer a summary of congressional hearings on legislation and an examination of the rationale behind a bill, as well as the primary arguments for and against it. Currently, these documents are made available though THOMAS but only after they have been published by GPO. Making committee reports available as soon as possible would assure that those who are interested in a piece of legislation can receive the most current and comprehensive information about it. Waiting for printing before making information available on the Internet misses the huge advantage of electronic dissemination. The current policy resembles the early days of the automobile, when laws required that horse-drawn buggies with lanterns light the way for their speedier replacements.
<p>
<li><b> Hearing and mark-up transcripts (within five days).</b> Currently, most citizens have to wait until official committee publication to obtain transcripts of congressional hearings. Publication of such transcripts often takes months or even more than a year, frequently occurring when an issue once considered crucial has faded from center stage. Although the public is denied quick and free access to such transcripts, lobbyists can purchase them from private transcribing agencies. By making hearing and mark-up transcripts available, the proposed House Rule change would help to give every citizen the information easily available to special interests. The 104th Congress changed its rules to allow C-SPAN and citizens to attend more committee and subcommittee hearings and mark-ups; thus it is only fitting for citizens unable to attend a hearing personally or view it on television to be able to read what transpired. Now that the Internet is an option, there is no good reason why transcripts should be delayed because of printing schedules. 
<p>
<li><b>Prepared statements (when submitted).</b> When individuals testify before Congress, they are asked to provide written copies of their testimony for distribution to members of the committee. In addition to requiring hard copies, House and Senate committees should ask witnesses to submit their testimony on diskette. Prepared statements could then be made available immediately on the relevant committee Web site. 
<p>
<li><b>Schedules and notices (when distributed).</b> Posting committee and subcommittee notices, hearings, and mark-up meeting times would allow the public to better keep track of committee activities. Currently, advance information on committee meetings is most easily accessible through specialized publications that are targeted specifically at congressional staffers and lobbyists. Placing such information on the Internet would afford constituents the opportunity to contact their representatives to voice their concerns and suggest possible questions for witnesses.
<p>
<li><b>Committee rules (when approved or amended).</b> Committee rules include important technical procedures, whose nuances vary from committee to committee. Making these rules available to the public would help to demystify internal committee workings. 
<p>
<li><b>Oversight plans and activity reports.</b> Congress has broad constitutional authority to engage in oversight and investigation. Through its oversight of the executive branch, Congress often seeks to publicize or prevent abuses of federal authority, to identify wasteful federal programs, and to save federal tax dollars. House and Senate committees would more easily invite the participation of whistleblowers or others knowledgeable about a subject by making oversight plans more available. 
<p>
<li><b>Member and staff directories.</b> Members of Congress serve at the public's will. Their staffers, though unelected, are given the public's trust, and can wield enormous influence. Their office addresses and telephone numbers should be available to the public. Staff listings can be found in various Capitol Hill directories, but these books are expensive to purchase and not widely available outside the Washington, D.C., area. Making such information more easily available would be a boon to ordinary citizens. 
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By placing this vast array of information at the fingertips of the on-line public, the House Task Force recommendations would effectively open up the doors of congressional committees, thereby enhancing efforts at full, effective disclosure of congressional activity. 
<p>
<b>BROADENING DISCLOSURE POLICIES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to the impressive recommendations of the House Task Force, Congress should release additional information on line. In particular, Congress should place on line information in the public domain that has not been readily available electronically, including:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Conference Reports.</b> For a bill to become law, both chambers of Congress must approve identical versions of the same bill (the conference report). These reports can contain significant changes in legislation already voted on in the House and Senate, as conference compromises or additions may not have appeared in either congressional version of the legislation. As conference committees serve temporarily, they would not have a regular mechanism for publishing their reports, so the House and Senate standing committees with lead responsibility for a particular conference should place the compromise legislation and report on their own home pages.
<p>
<li><b>Voting records and (co)sponsorships for Members of the House and Senate.</b> Members of the House and Senate should be held accountable to constituents for their voting records. Numerous Web sites already publish select information on votes in the House and the Senate. If comprehensive voting records were readily accessible, constituents could more easily examine complete records of the performance of their representatives. Congress might even establish issue area databases that would group, for instance, all defense or transportation infrastructure votes. 
<p>
<li><b>Press releases and issue statements.</b> Press releases and issue statements are routinely sent to the national media and the regional press. By placing such documents on line, Members could better inform their constituents of their positions on various issues. 
<p>
<li><b>Franked mass mailings.</b> Congressmen are permitted to send mass mailing to their constituents for free, as long as the purpose of the mailing is to update citizens on their representative's official business. By placing the content of these publications on line, it would be much easier for journalists, watchdog groups, and political opponents to insure that this privilege is not used for electioneering.
<p>
<li><b>Congressional Research Service (CRS) Reports.</b> The CRS home page allows congressional staff access to a library of CRS Reports and Issue Briefs written at the request of Members of Congress. These reports summarize key research findings and the state of public opinion on a given public policy issue, and clearly explain the impact of proposed legislation. They often are a major source of information for congressional staffers and Members of the House and Senate in shaping prospective legislation. There is no reason to keep this information from the public, especially since the costly research services are funded by their tax dollars. To make such reports available, however, long-standing language in the House legislative branch appropriations requiring the CRS to focus solely on serving Congress would have to be amended. 
<p>
<li><b>House and Senate Records, including the Statement of Disbursements of the House, Secretary of the Senate Reports, and House and Senate Financial Disclosure Reports.</b> In the aftermath of the banking and post office scandals, the 104th Congress undertook significant measures to overhaul the documents that show how House members spend the funds available to run their offices (the Representational Allowances). Making this information more widely available would allow constituents to compare the franking and office expenditures of their elected representatives to those of other Senators and Congressmen and help to restore public confidence in Congress.
<p>
<li><b>Federal Election Commission reports.</b> In nearly every election, there is a clamor for campaign finance reform. One reason is the belief that special interests have been able to purchase access to Members of Congress. By allowing quick, free, and easy on-line access to Federal Election Commission reports, Congress could help to disperse some of the clouds of suspicion and misinformation surrounding campaign financing. 
<p>
<li><b>Lobbyist Disclosure Reports.</b> The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 closed numerous loopholes in lobby registration requirements. Currently, these forms are retrievable only by lobbyist, not by bill, committee, issue, or dollar amount. Placing these Disclosure Reports on line would make it much simpler for constituents to research the lobbying activity surrounding a particular issue or committee.
<p>
<li><b>Whistleblower Page.</b> By establishing a whistleblower page, Congress would encourage citizens -- some of whom may be reluctant or ignorant of how to file such reports -- to document cases of waste, fraud, and abuse, thereby potentially saving millions of tax dollars annually. A system operator working for the whistleblower page could forward appropriate information to the relevant committee, subcommittee, or federal agency inspector general. Strict precautions would need to be taken to maintain confidentiality for whistleblowers. 
</ul>
<p>
<b>WHAT A CONGRESSIONAL FOIA WOULD NOT DO</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By pledging to place information on the Internet, Congress would define its FOIA commitment. Increased access to official and committee documents will keep citizens better informed; however, the congressional FOIA should not be so broad as to allow unlimited access to all areas of congressional activity. Congress should not duplicate the FOIA that applies to executive branch agencies, whose members are not held accountable to the voters via the electoral process. Through its execution of the laws, executive branch agencies tend to affect individuals directly, whereas legislation is far more general in scope. Because of their particular powers and lack of direct accountability to the voters, executive branch agencies should be held to a different FOIA standard than the legislative branch. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The legislative process is one of give-and-take, and individual Members often will shift position on given legislation as that legislation itself changes. Congressional staffers and Members have a right to operate with a degree of confidentiality, so that they do not fear that every word they write could one day become part of the public record. The Privacy Act of 1974 and the Computer Security Act of 1987 contain provisions that require federal offices to protect individuals from the unauthorized release of personal information and to protect the public from receiving documents that may not be accurate. Sensitive information in the computer systems of individual congressional offices should be protected from dissemination. Internal office memoranda and preliminary documents such as discussion drafts of bills, for example, should not be distributed on line, as such documents represent neither official actions nor even the considered viewpoint of a legislator.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By adding information recommended by the Task Force on Committee Reform to information that Congress already makes public, and by establishing an umbrella disclosure system through the Internet, Congress could devise a freedom of information system which is simultaneously comprehensive for the public but less invasive for the institution than is the executive branch process. Because the Congressional FOIA would be an internal congressional rule, complaints would be resolved within Congress, rather than by the courts. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The changes heralded by placing member offices and committee information on line should not be exaggerated. Increasing the amount of information on line should not, for instance, be seen as opening the gates for what has been termed electronic democracy. The congressional FOIA proposal falls far short of creating electronic plebiscites. Congressional Web sites should not become the locus of instantaneous and unscientific polling. In the eyes of America's Founding Fathers, Congress, particularly the Senate, was to be a deliberative body, not an immediate mirror of the public's unfettered passions and prejudices. Increasing public access to congressional documents can serve an important didactic role that dovetails well with the Founding Fathers' vision. 
<p>
<b>HOW TO IMPLEMENT A CONGRESSIONAL FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Several steps must be taken to implement a Congressional FOIA. On the first day of the 105th Congress, the House and Senate should adopt rules mandating that committees electronically disclose the information recommended in the Task Force on Committee Review report. At the same time, the House and Senate should provide for the establishment of "freedom of information" home pages. These pages would include links to sources of already disclosable information on Congress, including Federal Election Commission data, lobbying and financial disclosure reports, Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate reports, franking commission data, and Congressional Research Service reports. Some of this material, currently unavailable electronically, would need to be adapted to the new format.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To assure effective implementation of the Congressional FOIA, the House Oversight Committee and Senate Rules Committees should appoint advisory groups consisting of computer industry experts, journalists, and political scientists. These advisors would review the information Congress discloses and offer suggestions to improve the presentation, format, or types of information available. The boards would offer informed outside advice on congressional disclosure policy and also represent a congressional outreach to the Internet community and other information consumers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As a second step, the Senate Rules and House Oversight committees should be assigned the task of defining what categories of information individual Members' offices should be required to disclose via the Internet. These committees should also determine whether responsibility for posting such information -- such as franking costs, franked mass mailing, and financial disclosure forms -- should lie with each individual office or should be maintained through a central service. The House Oversight and Senate Rules committees should coordinate to assure that the information disseminated by House and Senate offices is as similar as possible, while respecting the divergent characters of the two congressional chambers. The Senate Rules and House Oversight reports, which should include an implementation schedule, should be completed no later than December 1997.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Public input is essential to an effective Congress. The 104th Congress opened its procedures to the public more than ever before. The 105th Congress should build on this success by mandating widespread disclosure of congressional documents and information on the Internet by passing a Congressional Freedom of Information Act. Making House and Senate documents and information available on the Internet will allow citizens to better judge the effectiveness of their elected officials. Making committee documents available to the public at large will promote input on pending legislation from knowledgeable sources beyond the Beltway. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Furthermore, using the Internet as the freedom of information mechanism will allow Congress to determine and manage information disclosure without the disputes and confrontations that have characterized the executive branch freedom of information process. The enormous success of THOMAS -- 35 million computerized inquiries in just 22 months -- is proof of a clear constituency for the type of electronic information that a congressional FOIA would make available. Electronic access to such documents, moreover, is relatively inexpensive, especially when compared to old fashioned distribution by the Government Printing Office or the U.S. Postal Service. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Congressional FOIA would provide the public easy and prompt access to a variety of documents produced by the legislative branch. Much of the material that would be covered under a Congressional FOIA is already in the public domain, including press releases, voting records, legislative co-sponsorships, Federal Election Commission reports, conference reports, amendments to bills, and committee oversight plans. A Congressional FOIA would assure that such information is posted on the Internet in a standardized, user-friendly format. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to facilitating access to documents that Congress readily distributes, a Congressional FOIA would afford timely public access to committee and conference materials that previously had been released only in final format, including committee and subcommittee prints of bills and marks and preliminary transcripts of hearings and mark-ups. Afforded access to such materials in a timely fashion, citizens whose lives might be affected by amendments or new laws would be able to communicate with their representatives as legislation is being considered. Congress would be able to receive more feedback on legislative proposals than is possible in the typical half-day hearing with a limited number of witnesses. Policy specialists at universities, businesses, and in state and local governments also could offer perspectives that Congress would not otherwise hear.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet the main reason to enact a congressional FOIA is not to make Congress more effective, but because it is the right thing to do. In their offices and at committee meetings, Members of Congress are conducting the public's business. The public has a right to know what occurs in a detailed and timely fashion. Moreover, a congressional FOIA would allow citizens to comment on pending proposals. Without information on committee business in particular, only Washington insiders and high-powered lobbyists would have the ability to do anything to affect deals or amendments. Opening the congressional committee system to the 30 million households with personal computers can only enhance our democracy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both the House and the Senate would have to institute rules changes to implement a Congressional FOIA. Such rules changes would stipulate both the extent and the format of the information to be made available electronically. To assure effective execution of a Congressional FOIA, the relevant House and Senate committees should review implementation plans with the assistance of a group of scholars and information industry leaders.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By instituting a Congressional Freedom of Information Act, Congress would increase public access to committee documents over the Internet in an organized, comprehensive, and user-friendly manner. As Congress continues its efforts of the past two years to devolve power and authority away from Washington to citizens and the institutions they control directly, citizens will need increased access to the sources of information that will guide them. By empowering ordinary citizens at the expense of well-connected Washington insiders, a Congressional FOIA would be a critical step in reforming government.

<p>

<center><h2>This Week's Message (February 7)</h2></center>

<p>

Welcome to the FRC information line. This message will be updated
Friday, Feb. 14th at the close of business.

<p>

<h3>Issue One. The State of the Union.</h3>

<p>

In response to the
State of the Union address by President Clinton and remarks by
Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts on Tuesday, February 4, FRC President
Gary Bauer called on Congress to draw on the strengths of both
presentations to produce an agenda that will serve the cause of
family and cultural renewal.  Although the President spoke of
mainstream concerns, education, drugs, crime, and community empowerment,
his remarks were generally silent on cultural issues of right
and wrong which are at the core of our nation's social ills.

<p>

In the days to come FRC will examine the President's forthcoming
detailed proposals and some of his current proposals including
an increase in federal funding of the National Endowment for the
Arts (NEA), Internet access, and education.  If we truly want
to challenge the nation's artists, we must ask them to create
their works with the same independence of energy and spirit that
animated our nation's writers and painters for centuries before
the advent of the NEA.  Continuing this federal handout to a favored
few is morally wrong and unnecessary, at best.  Furthermore, access
to the Internet for every American 12 year old from a computer
in every home is not merely an issue of fiber optics, but of the
fiber of our people.  The President's goal simply cannot and will
not be reached if the problem of pervasive pornography on the
Internet is not resolved.  In this regard, what the president's
appointees on the Supreme Court do with the Communications Decency
Act will make all the difference.  The same can be said for most
of the family values agenda; neither strong rhetoric or wide laws
will matter much if our courts continue to erase what our elected
leaders have enacted and signed. On education, President Clinton
appeared as a forward-thinking leader by focusing on education,
but instead he exposed his belief in big government.  Last year
President Clinton declared the era of big government was over,
however, he's proposing a $51 billion initiative that would massively
expand the federal role in education.  In the past 18 years since
the creation of the Department of Education, test scores have
gone down, the quality of education has declined and too many
schools have become unsafe for students and teachers alike. All
this despite a tripling of its budget. There's no connection between
government spending and educational improvement.  But there is
a connection between government spending and government control
and Congress should look for ways to increase parent's control
instead of government's.  It's the only way we can really reform
education.

<p>

Perhaps the biggest disappointment of the night was the president's
failure to speak the plain truth about the deterioration of human
rights, specifically in the vast nation of China.  This oversight
made his strong words about emerging democracies in Central America
and Eastern Europe ring hollow.  Bauer pointed out, the Berlin
Wall didn't come down because of some amorphous sense of 'inevitability.'
It came down because leaders like Ronald Reagan and Pope John
Paul II had the moral courage to stand up to oppressive tyrants.
Active moral leadership is needed today on behalf of the more
than one billion men, women, and children who are systematically
and cruelly abused by a despotic regime in Communist China. The
United States has an obligation to provide this moral leadership
and act upon these violations of fundamental liberties.

<p>

<h3>Issue Two. Foreign Aid Abortion Vote.</h3>

<p>

The first pro-life
vote of the 105th Congress will take place on Thursday, February
13th, when members of the House and perhaps the Senate decide
whether or not to release an additional $123 million to international
organizations, many of which perform and promote abortions as
a method of family planning. Pro-life Members in the House will
also seek a vote on an <I>alternative</I> measure, sponsored by
pro-life leader Chris Smith (R-NJ), which will release money for
family planning but <I>only if</I> groups are <I>not</I> allowed
to promote or perform abortions.  As a result of President Clinton's
executive order, issued during his first week in office, taxpayer-financed
groups can not only lobby foreign governments for changes in their
abortion laws but can also perform elective abortions.   FRC urges
you to call your Congressman and Senators and urge them to vote
AGAINST the Clinton administration's resolution.  House members
should also be urged to vote FOR the abortion limitation proposed
by pro-life Congressman Chris Smith.

<p>

Thank you for calling the FRC Legislative Hotline.

						Clintons Phony War on Drugs
					</h1> 
        </center>
<p>
<center>by Malcolm Wallop</center>
<p>
Admidst much fanfare, President Clinton and Vice President Gore on March 7, 1996 
hosted a one-day summit titled Youth Drug and Violence in America to call attention 
to and issue recommendations about the related problems of teen violence and the 
skyrocketing use of illegal drugs by our nations youth.
<P>
It needs to be asked why it has taken an election year for President Clinton to discover 
that Americas drug problem has reached crisis levels.  The evidence that drug use among 
teenagers has been  rising during President Clintons term in office is overwhelming and 
has been obvious for some time.  Indeed the statistics are staggering:
<P>
<UL>
 <LI> The rate of monthly illicit drug use by children aged 12-17 increased 56 percent from 
1992 to 1994, according to the Clinton administrations own estimates.
 <LI> The Justice Department reported in September 1995 that one of every three juvenile 
detainees was under the influence of drugs at the time of the offense.
<LI>  A December 1995 survey found that cocaine use by those in grades nine through 
twelve had increased 36 percent since 1992, and the use of hallucinogens had 
increased by 75 percent.
 <LI> Between 1992 and 1994, the rate of marijuana use among children 12-17 nearly 
doubled, according to the National Survey on Drug Use.
</UL>
<P>
Until now, President Clinton has paid little attention to what most Americans have 
recognized all along to be a national crisis.  Despite the tough talk and finger pointing at 
the drug summit, the Clinton administrations response to Americas drug problem has 
been abysmal.  A quick look at the facts:
<UL>
 <LI> In his first year in office, Clinton cut his drug policy staff by 85 percent.
 <LI> Last year, the Clinton administration proposed cutting more than 100 drug 
prosecutors from US attorneys offices and cutting funding for interdiction and drug 
intelligence programs.
 <LI> The Drug Enforcement Agency trained no special agents in 1993, and none were 
budgeted to be trained in 1994 or 1995.
 <LI> Attorney General Janet Reno announced soon after taking office that she wanted to 
reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking and related crimes.  Not 
surprisingly, the number of federal drug prosecutions has been dropping.
<LI>  And who can forget Clintons own Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who advocated 
legalizing drugs in order to reduce the crime rate.
<P>
</UL>
In announcing his drug summit last November, President Clinton stated that it is 
important to counter messages that tell children it is cool, sexy, attractive to drink or get 
high.  He will surely want to explain why, then, when asked on MTV in 1992 if he 
would inhale marijuana if he had to do it all over again, he responded to laughter: Sure if 
I could.  I tried before.
<P>
President Clintons total lack of leadership in the war on drugs over the past three years 
should cause all Americans to view skeptically his embrace of the issue in an election 
year.  The tragedy is that prior to his election in 1992, America was winning the war on 
drugs.  Even NBC News reported that Just Say No was an effective message in the 
1980s.
<P>
Then, presidential leadership was highly visible, though tough and effective.  And, as a 
consequence, drug use plummeted.  Between 1985 and 1992, overall drug use was cut in 
half.  The number of cocaine users dropped from 5.8 million to 1.8 million.  The number 
of marijuana users fell from 22 million to 8.5 million.  The percentage of high school 
seniors who used drugs was reduced from a high of 54.2 percent in 1979 to 27.1 percent 
in 1992.
<P>
The reason?  Children were continually bombarded with the message that drugs were 
wrong.  Dealers were put on notice that peddling drugs to kids would not be tolerated.  
And both the Bush and Reagan administrations pursued tough drug enforcement and 
interdiction policies.
<P>
Sadly, these trends have been reversed in just three years.  Any progress that we as a 
nation were making in curtailing drug use has been destroyed because the Clinton 
administration fled the field of battle and has been missing ever since.
President Clintons drug summit was an indication that his pollsters can recognize a 
campaign issue.  But we must demand more than campaign events and photo 
opportunities from our president.  The lives of millions of young people are at stake.

<p>

<h3><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship asked four state welfare officials -- Eloise Anderson of California, Vance McMahan of Texas, Don Taylor of Mississippi, and Jason Turner of Wisconsin -- to comment on the following questions about what the welfare-reform legislation of 1996 will mean for their states:</i></h3>
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <i>States have been ahead of the federal government in welfare reform for many years, and 43 states have already received some sort of waiver from federal welfare rules. What will be the most important changes for your state as a result of the federal legislation? How do these compare in magnitude with reforms your state has already embarked on?</i></b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Eloise Anderson, director, California Department of Social Services:</b> Under the new federal welfare legislation, recipients will no longer be able to receive aid indefinitely (until the youngest child at home turns 18) without working. Time limits will force more people into jobs. This will lead to more families entering the mainstream and over time becoming self-sufficient. Government will cease to be the first place families turn to when in trouble. And childbearing and parenting will again be a primary responsibility of parents.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Families will become more accountable to each other. States will be given the opportunity to treat married and single-parent families more equally so that there is no penalty for marriage. Stricter paternity establishment will lead to greater child support. There will be no aid for teen parents who drop out of school and they will be required to live at home or in an adult-supervised setting as a condition of aid.  <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The legislation also will remove costly and restrictive federal mandates and give states a <i>little</i> more flexibility to design programs that work best for their communities. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Vance McMahan, policy director, Office of the Governor, State of Texas:</b> The biggest impact of the federal welfare legislation may, at first, be more symbolic than substantive. The decision to end the federal entitlement to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) marks a reversal of 61 years of social policy, an admission that the current welfare system has become more a cause of poverty than a cure, and a recognition that perhaps someone outside Washington, D.C., may be able to do a better job at helping those in need. By so doing, the federal law gives states and communities more freedom to tailor their policies to reflect the values and specific needs of their people. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Ending the welfare entitlement has also changed the fundamental question. Instead of asking, "What is this person entitled to?," states can now ask, "What does this person need to become self-sufficient?" By changing the question, the bill gives states the freedom to try different answers. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As a practical matter, the bill's initial impact will be limited, since it allows states to continue to operate under existing waivers. Texas will be affected by the decision to cut off food stamps and SSI to some legal immigrants. State officials are trying to determine the impact of this provision. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The new work-participation requirements will also affect Texas. Texas does not have a generous welfare grant ($188 a month for a family of three) and thus tends to have a welfare population that is relatively poorer and less educated than other states. Governor George Bush is, however, committed to marshaling all necessary resources to liberate as many people as possible from dependence on government. Welfare rolls in Texas have shrunk by 15 percent during his term. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Don Taylor, executive director, Mississippi Department of Human Services:</b> The current legislation provides a long overdue shifting of the balance of power between federal and state levels of government. Congress finally acknowledged that the "one size fits all" federal programs are an abysmal failure, so states will now be allowed to tailor welfare plans to meet specific needs of their states. We may now correctly measure the success of our programs by the number of individuals placed in the work force, not the number enrolled in training programs that often have no connection to the actual job market. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Jason Turner, director of capacity building, Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development:</b> The new law could not have been passed at a more propitious time for Wisconsin -- just as we were negotiating with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services over the terms of the waiver, the new law made it possible to implement Governor Tommy Thompson's radical welfare replacement program, "Wisconsin Works," or "W2," without major compromises. This plan eliminates AFDC entirely and replaces it with a system of work opportunities for individuals of all abilities. It differs from other reform initiatives (such as two-years-and-off plans) in that no unrestricted cash assistance is provided, not even temporarily. Instead, individuals who need family income will have four work options available, starting at the top (private employment) and working down to community-service jobs or sheltered workshops, if necessary. Temporary "bridge" loans, subsidized child care, and subsidized medical insurance will be made available -- whatever is absolutely necessary to make work possible. But in the end, all parents will enjoy the dignity of earning their family income through work. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There were many obstacles for the governor to overcome in order to realize this concept. The ideological left in Wisconsin and in Washington had fully mobilized to oppose W2. But a new Republican legislative majority in Madison and the new federal legislation passed in Washington combined to make their protests moot.

<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <i>Many liberals predict that children and families will be hurt by the welfare legislation. The Urban Institute has predicted an increase of 1.1 million children in poverty. The National Coalition for the Homeless declares that "without increased resources for child care, affordable housing, health care and education, this reform will prove to be most effective at moving people from welfare . . . into deeper poverty and homelessness." And Hugh Price, the president of the National Urban League, predicts that "desperate mothers" will "turn to hustling, prostitution, drug dealing, or panhandling." He says that "Washington has decided to end the War on Poverty and begin a war on poor children." How do you respond? </i></b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Anderson (California):</b> The Urban Institute's and the National Urban League's predictions on poverty and homelessness do not take into account the behavioral changes that will result from time limits and other new rules under this welfare legislation. The panic is unwarranted.<p>

 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Welfare recipients are no different than anybody else. They will do what it takes to survive. Once government gets out of their way, welfare recipients will respond accordingly.  <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I take issue with the National Urban League's assumption that "desperate mothers" will "turn to hustling, prostitution, drug dealing, or panhandling." I see this as a put-down of AFDC recipients. These people are not criminals or lowlifes. I have always said that AFDC recipients are capable, rational, and smart enough to make it on their own without government's help. Advocates need to quit demeaning them as if they are helpless, hopeless, and criminal without government intervention. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>McMahan (Texas):</b> The "war on poor children" began, however unintentionally, with the expansion of the welfare state, which trapped families in dependency by discouraging work and marriage. Studies show children raised in a welfare environment suffer from decreased cognitive abilities and increased behavioral and emotional problems. In Texas, we are committed to taking care of those who truly cannot take care of themselves. As for the rest of the welfare population, we will no longer treat them as victims and wards of the state, but instead as responsible individuals capable of self-improvement and self-sufficiency. That's why Texas requires each welfare recipient to sign a personal responsibility contract outlining what the state will do for them (give them a hand up through job placement, child care, transportation, et cetera) and what they will do in return (work, learn, or train for benefits; identify the father of their child; have their children immunized; stay off drugs; et cetera). <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Taylor (Mississippi):</b> The "war on children" began when the federal government rewarded nonwork and nonmarriage. While perhaps well meaning, those who advocate raising family income artificially through welfare have made the state a competitor with the father and mother as the key providers for the family. In Mississippi, the value of welfare benefits to unwed mothers now exceeds the income of 17 to 30 percent of all single men. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Too many liberals still have a paternalistic plantation mentality. They think welfare recipients are incapable of achieving self-sufficiency, and thus forever dependent on government largesse. I invite those liberals to mull over the words of Franklin D. Roosevelt: "Welfare is a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Turner (Wisconsin):</b> Half the counties in Wisconsin have reduced their AFDC caseloads <i>by more than 70 percent</i> since 1987 without succumbing to the dire predictions of the liberals. Since January of this year, Milwaukee has been reducing its caseload at an annual rate of 24 percent, and general assistance for childless adults was ended entirely last year without Wisconsin's largest city heaving-to. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What liberals have entirely failed to grasp is that social maladies, including poverty, are the result of learned behavior in which enforced idleness is a contributing factor. Far from sending nonworking adults "over the edge," required work thrusts people into constructive social interactions that can lift this depression born of isolation, and can identify other problems for resolution. <p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <i>Many conservatives have argued that the principal objective of welfare reform should be to bring down the rate of illegitimacy and divorce. Do you think this will be achieved by the new welfare bill in your state? If so, how? If not, how else can families in your state be put back together?</i></b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Anderson (California):</b> The aim of welfare reform is to make life better for children. Right now, AFDC children are left out of the mainstream because their parents are not required to work. They see their parents being unproductive and getting food, clothing, and shelter without having to work. Children become so unfamiliar with work that they lack the skills and discipline they need to succeed in a job. Nor do children ever see marriage, or understand its value. Having children out of marriage becomes the norm, and men are devalued. They never see a father in the home. Government has become the father, the provider of the family. By emphasizing work, welfare reform will lead to cooperation between a father and a mother, and create an interdependence for the well-being of the children, which will lead to cultural mainstreaming and stronger families. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>McMahan (Texas):</b> No piece of legislation, no matter how bold, can single-handedly reverse the breakdown of the family. At a minimum, we can at least eliminate incentives to destructive behavior. To its credit, the federal welfare bill does that by setting tough work standards, requiring teen parents to live at home or in an adult-supervised setting, and providing incentive bonuses to states that reduce out-of-wedlock births.<p>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Governor Bush has worked to enact similar changes in Texas, but he also recognizes that out-of-wedlock births, hard-core drug use, and violent juvenile crime are fundamentally moral and spiritual problems that can't be solved by government alone. The solution to these problems lies in changing the culture, renewing our commitment to God, and returning to our bedrock values. In Texas, we are working not only to reform welfare, but also to nurture institutions that have traditionally and more effectively communicated our basic values: charities, churches, synagogues, and neighborhoods. These institutions hold the most promise for changing lives through compassion that is, in Marvin Olasky's words, "challenging, personal, and spiritual." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Taylor (Mississippi):</b> More than 44 percent of births in Mississippi in 1993 were to unmarried mothers, and for teenagers, more than three-fourths of all births were illegitimate. Welfare has eroded the social foundation of marriage and made it financially irrelevant. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The welfare bill now allows our state to craft eligibility and benefits regulations to encourage marriage rather than reward irresponsible behavior. We hope this will begin to overcome the corrosive effect of welfare on the family structure. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Turner (Wisconsin):</b> Under W2, income is only received through work, so there is no economic incentive for illegitimacy. Nor can teens set up independent households with cash benefits under W2 -- they must live with their parents or in a supervised home for unwed mothers. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The authors of the welfare-reform bill should be commended for offering financial rewards to states that reduce illegitimacy. Although state policymakers have only an indirect influence on illegitimacy, this provision puts the subject on the table for ongoing discussion and debate. Let us look forward to the day when illegitimacy replaces poverty as our most-discussed social indicator. <p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <i>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that most states will accept a financial penalty rather than try to comply with the work requirements of the welfare legislation. Do you believe your state will be able to move the required proportion of recipients from welfare to work? And if so, how will you do this?</i></b>  <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Anderson (California):</b> Meeting the tough work requirements will be a challenge, but we have every intention of succeeding. Our current welfare-to-work program has achieved tremendous results in California counties even where unemployment rates are high. Last year, when Los Angeles County shifted from a classroom-training emphasis to a "work first" approach, the number of job placements for welfare recipients skyrocketed by 400 percent to 25,000. In rural Calaveras County, job placements from 1992-93 to 1994-95 increased by 90 percent. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our Employment Development Department is identifying entry-level jobs that are available in different communities, and the skills needed for those jobs. Relocation is one avenue to those jobs that we are looking into. But government can only help bridge the gap. The private sector is the job provider. Neighborhoods, communities, and churches also play a role in helping recipients become successful. And the real work in moving out of dependency must be done by the recipients. We must shift from the notion that government has the answers and will rescue people from themselves. We can provide people with information, but it is up to them to use it. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>McMahan (Texas):</b> The bar is high. The federal welfare bill sets a work participation rate of 25 percent for Fiscal Year 1997, rising to 50 percent for FY 2002. Yet the highly acclaimed work program in Riverside, California, managed to place only 30 percent of welfare recipients in long-term jobs. Given the flexibility to tailor work programs to the needs of our welfare population, Texas is committed to doing its best to meet the standard. We will have to restore the virtue and value of fatherhood. We will have to contract with private companies to place welfare recipients in real jobs, paying only for results. We will have to challenge and create incentives for Texas's private sector to provide more slots for on-the-job training for welfare recipients. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Taylor (Mississippi):</b> Mississippi is already meeting the mandate with our WorkFirst pilot program. Under WorkFirst, implemented in 1995, the emphasis is on work, not on open-ended entitlements. The clients' first contact after being approved for benefits is with a job-placement specialist, not a social worker, as in the past. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The ability of states to meet the mandated work requirements is grossly underestimated by the Congressional Budget Office. Federal bureaucrats are undoubtedly fearful that states will, in fact, be successful in this endeavor and therefore set the stage for future transfer of additional programs to state control. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Turner (Wisconsin):</b> Work participation standards are an important tool for states. And universal recipient participation in some work activity is the only proven way for most programs to achieve dramatic results. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The CBO and many states are unnecessarily concerned about the cost of providing work requirement slots. These slots are by and large cheap to run -- the major expense is that of subsidizing associated child care in order to permit the covered individuals to work. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This concern also ignores a central dynamic of welfare reform. When individuals are faced with a choice of receiving welfare benefits in exchange for working in a work-requirement slot, or else going to work for wages in the private sector economy, most will choose the latter. Under these circumstances, the caseload quickly shrinks.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <i>Now that states have full responsibility for welfare, what elements of this responsibility would you like to turn over to churches, businesses, and other private organizations?</i> </b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Anderson (California):</b> States now have the primary responsibility for welfare, but they cannot do it alone. Faith-based groups can provide counseling, temporary food and shelter, and clothing for those in need. Businesses need to be receptive to hiring. Goodwill Industries has worked with us closely to help those who face barriers to employment. It has a long history of helping the disabled find mainstream employment. Using nonprofits such as Goodwill is vital to the success of the new programs. We need to stop thinking that government owes us something and start thinking about duty, personal responsibility, and communities coming together to help those in crisis.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>McMahan (Texas):</b> Media reports on the welfare bill have overlooked a significant provision -- the "charitable choice" clause. Under "charitable choice," private, charitable, and faith-based groups can compete for contracts or participate in voucher programs whenever a state uses nongovernment providers to deliver welfare services. If we are to replace welfare with a more compassionate and effective system, faith-based institutions will have to be part of the answer -- whether it's a church providing day care or Victory Fellowship helping people kick drug addiction. As Governor Bush has said: "Government can hand out money, but it cannot put hope in our hearts or a sense of purpose in our lives." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Governor Bush rejects the statist view that government has exclusive jurisdiction for the poor; rather, government shares responsibility with society's "little platoons" that do the heavy lifting of changing lives from the inside out. Texas's mission is to facilitate and cultivate these untapped resources, not to displace them, and certainly not to secularize their religious character. The governor has appointed a 16-member advisory task force on faith-based community-service programs to determine how best to free faith-based programs and organizations from unreasonable government regulations and allow them to go about the business of changing lives.<p>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Taylor (Mississippi):</b> Mississippi's "Faith and Families" program matches volunteer AFDC recipients to local churches and synagogues, thus restoring the historical role of religious institutions to help unfortunate members of their communities. To date, almost 300 churches and synagogues have been enlisted to "adopt" welfare recipients in their communities to help them transition into the work force.
 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The business community will now be able to determine and provide the type of training necessary to move welfare recipients into the work force. In lieu of the ineffective training provided by a variety of government programs for jobs that often do not exist, local businesses can provide real skills for real jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Turner (Wisconsin):</b> Wisconsin now requires an AFDC applicant to enter into an interactive problem-solving session with a caseworker, who helps the applicant look for alternatives to welfare, including immediate employment. It has been shockingly effective -- in Milwaukee 28 percent of those exiting the problem-solving session decide they can do without AFDC after all, and elsewhere the proportion is as high as 50 percent. Interviews indicate that many AFDC applicants <i>like the idea that someone is helping them decide to do what they knew was right all along</i>.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The point here is that many trapped inside the system are looking for some kind of moral guidance. But by and large government is not equipped to provide this guidance -- nor should it be. Under W2, churches are being asked to help develop homes for teen mothers and private charities are offering work opportunities for those needing to practice work before entering competitive private employment. Finally, the entire system, which was formerly run exclusively by state and county government, will be open under W2 to any private providers of services on a competitive bid basis.

<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <i>What do you most dislike about the legislation, and why?</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Anderson (California):</b> There are still strings attached that work against California. The "maintenance of effort" requirement was not removed from the SSI/SSP program for the aged, blind, and disabled, giving us no flexibility to make the program more effective and cost-efficient. This will mean a loss in savings of $277 million for California.<p>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The federal legislation is geared more toward state-run welfare systems and not county-run systems such as California's. We have far different issues than state-run programs and we need to be treated differently.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We are also a border state with nearly 40 percent of the legal immigrant population of this country. I believe that sponsors of immigrants should be held accountable for taking care of their own. If legal immigrants want to enjoy the benefits of their adopted homeland, they should take the next step and become U.S. citizens. However, I also believe immigration is a federal responsibility. The responsibility of caring for legal immigrants who have been allowed to enter federal programs should be a federal responsibility, not a state or local responsibility.	<p>

States should be rewarded for such efforts. It is more expensive and more difficult to get someone off welfare than to take steps to keep them from ever going on. The bill also ties the hands of states by requiring a "maintenance of effort." This limits states' flexibility to design and implement their own programs and set their own spending priorities. The bill contains a number of other strings that ensure continued federal involvement.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	States were not given any new flexibility on Medicaid. Federal mandates have made Medicaid the 800-pound gorilla of most state budgets -- at the expense of education and other programs. Medicaid now costs more than AFDC, food stamps, and SSI combined, and it keeps growing. In Texas, Medicaid spending as a percent of the state budget increased from 13 percent to 21 percent from 1990 to 1995. Fundamental welfare reform should include giving states freedom from oppressive Medicaid mandates so they can maximize the use of limited health-care dollars.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Taylor (Mississippi):</b> The reporting and data requirements of the 1996 legislation are burdensome, expensive, and time-consuming. The data required by the law exceed the needs of the state to effectively administer and efficiently monitor the program. These make-work requirements are a monumental waste of tax dollars designed to ensure that returning funds to the states will not adversely affect the number of federal bureaucrats in Washington.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some habits die hard.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Turner (Wisconsin):</b> There is so much to like about the current federal legislation that one is loath to criticize, lest we all wake up and find out that the end of AFDC was just a wishful dream. So let us just take this opportunity to thank all of those who worked so hard for this day, including the leadership of the Congress and those engaged in the intellectual debates, including <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, the publisher of this magazine.
