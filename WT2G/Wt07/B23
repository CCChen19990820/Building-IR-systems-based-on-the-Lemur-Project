<p>Curtis, Paul N. 1991. <i>BlueBelting</i>. Three pages. Recommendations
of the SOBA Dockage Committee (ne Small Craft Harbor Committee), based
upon a 1990 nationwide survey of state boat access agencies, of what state
governments can do via economic incentives or protective zoning to preserve
waterfront property for marinas, boatyards, small boat access and other
recreational waterdependent uses. Published in the 1991 SOBA Conference
Proceedings on pages 163-165. For a copy, write: SOBA, P.O. Box 25655,

<p>Pelczarski, Joseph E. 1990. <i>The Boatyard Preservation Restriction
Program of Massachusetts</i>. 11 pages. This paper has to do with a 1987
Massachusetts law which authorized the state to purchase development rights
on coastal waterfront land traditionally used as boatyards with the object
of preserving the land for such water-dependent usage. Subsequently, if
the land was sold by the owner, the state would have a restriction on the
new owner to keep it for use as a boatyard. For want of appropriations,
the law has not been activated to date. The author of this presentation
was a regional planner in the Massachusetts Coastal Zone Management Program.
The paper can be found on pages 121-131 ofthe 1990 SOBA Conference Proceedings.

<P>A: <A NAME="AK1">TITLE</A> OF CRT PROGRAM: ADA Impact on Boat Harbors, 
Marinas and Passenger Vessels </P>

<P>B: BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Protection from discrimination
on the basis of disability was extended to the private sector with passage
of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990(ADA). In Alaska, where the
majority of the boat harbors are owned and operated by State and Local
Governments there are is a lot of concern on how ADA will impact their
operations. Also many charter boat operators who would like to provide
services to people with disabilities are not sure what is required. The
goals of this project are to provide ideas and information through the
UAF Marine Advisory Program about how harbors, marinas and small passenger
vessels can comply with proposed new provisions of the Americans with Disabilities
Act of 1990. Information will be gathered through visits to 8 recreational/charter
boat areas around the United States to learn and document how other marinas
and charter operators are providing services to persons with disabilities.
There will also be meetings with U. S. Coast Guard officials who will be
setting ADA compliance standards for passenger vessels and participation
in programs at the National Center on Accessibility to receive the latest
information, research and training on making programs and facilities accessible
to people with disabilities. The type and cost of equipment, facilities
and retrofits that are required to meet ADA guidelines will also be investigated.
People with disabilities will be interviewed for this project to get their
insight into the kind and level of service they need. he information from
this project will be published in a report and/or brochure suggesting what
harbor and charter boat operators can do to comply with ADA. A series of
workshops will be conducted to disseminate the information gained from
this project.</P>

<P><A NAME="CA2"></A>A. TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Zebra Mussel Education Program
for Boaters - A Proactive Strategy for Preventing Transport of an Exotic
Pest Species to California</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Transport by recreational boats
is the most likely vector for introducing the zebra mussel to the west.
Sea Grant Extension programs throughout the Great Lakes and Eastern United
States have produced a significant amount of educational materials to educate
boaters about the zebra mussel and reduce the risk of spread between water
bodies. In this project, we propose to utilize Sea Grant Extension program
materials (adapted to focus on the threat of introduction to the west)
to develop a pilot educational program for recreational boaters in the
12 county Bay-Delta area. The project will include an evaluation of the
current level of awareness among boaters, distribution of a brochure, a
series of workshops for individuals involved in boater education and boating
facility management, and a re-evaluation of boater awareness upon completion
of the project. We expect to provide educational materials and program
development information to other regions of California and the west via
other western state Sea Grant Programs and the Western Zebra Mussel Task
Force. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="CA1"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Educational Program: Pollution
Prevention for Marinas and Recreational Boating </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: A three year educational program
focusing on pollution prevention for marinas and recreational boaters is
being conducted. During the first year a consensus building educational
program on boating related pollution was carried out. Participants included
128 representatives of boaters, boating businesses, government agencies
and environmental groups. Further research into marina and recreational
boating pollution was carried out the second year. Information regarding
pollution prevention for marinas, boaters and boat maintenance services
and educators was published in a manual, six brochures and an annotated
bibliography on pollution prevention. Information was disseminated further
through six pollution prevention seminars conducted throughout California
for 97 marina and boatyard operators in cooperation with other California
marine advisors. Pollution prevention educational materials were distributed
to about 350 people in California, to Sea Grant Extension colleagues in
six states and the National Sea Grant Depository. </P>

<P>In the third year, seminar participants were surveyed to determine if
there were changes in pollution prevention practices. The survey found
that there were significant increases in the use of 28 best management
practices for preventing pollution. To further publicize boater pollution
prevention two articles have been published in The Log waterfront newspaper.
Currently, seminars are also being organized for San Diego boaters, articles
are being developed for yacht club newsletters and a survey of existing
data and research needs on boating pollution economic issues is being carried
out.</P>

<P>A. <A NAME="DE1"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Beach Safety--Risk Management
</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM: The University of Delaware Sea Grant
Marine Advisory Service (UDSGMAS), along with other Sea Grant programs
in the Mid-Atlantic Region, has formed a partnership with the regional
chapter of the United States Lifesaving Association (USLA). This alliance
has led to the planning of three major lifesaving workshops since 1990.
These educational programs have provided a forum where lifeguard professionals
can meet formally and informally to discuss issues of importance. Additional
educational activities have also developed since the partnership was forged
(water safety audio- visuals, water safety fact sheets, related water safety
programs, etc.). A committee of USLA representatives and Sea Grant representatives
from the region continue to meet regularly and plan future activities.
A seminar was organized in May, 1995 for the USLA Board of Directors who
held their annual meeting in Alexandria, VA. Seminar topics included presentations
on beach erosion and shoreline stabilization, the U.S. Coast Guard Rescue
Swimmer Program, USLA National Certification Program, and how beach communities
respond to the American Disabilities Act. This program area is continuing
and the next scheduled Mid-Atlantic Lifesaving Seminar will be held for
lifeguards in Spring, 1997. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="DE2"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Clean Vessel Act--Clean Marina
Program </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM: Delaware, like many coastal states,
is beginning to address the impact that recreational boating has on water
quality in its state waters. The state agency (DNREC, Division of Fish
and Wildlife) responsible for overseeing boating activity in the state
received funding from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to address the
issue. The University of Delaware Sea Grant Marine Advisory Service (UDSGMAS)
was invited by DNREC to assist them in identifying problems caused by boaters,
in developing a plan to address the problems, and in preparing educational
materials targeted to the recreational boating sector. Currently, Sea Grant
continues to assist the state in developing educational materials for this
program. In addition, Delaware Sea Grant has recently been contracted to
draft the statewide Clean Vessel Act Program Plan to address the need for
dump stations and pumpouts throughout the state. The federally- supported
program is a five-year effort, and UDSGMAS will assist DNREC in all phases
of the program. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="DE3"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Community Tourism Outreach
</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: The University of Delaware Sea
Grant Marine Advisory Service (UDSGMAS) continues to assist coastal area
chambers of commerce with a variety of programs and activities designed
to improve their knowledge of visitor activities and increase their effectiveness
in meeting the needs of visiting tourists. UDSGMAS has completed visitor
profiles for each major coastal area chamber of commerce. The most recent
one was completed in 1993 for the Lewes Chamber of Commerce and Visitors
Bureau. Along with other organizations, we have formed the Southern Delaware
Small Business Education Network to provide seminars and workshops to members
of our tourism sector. During the past two years, we have planned and conducted
five tourism-related seminars dealing with a variety of topics including:
planning group tours, tourism marketing and advertising, managing festivals
and special events, business of art, and tourism research. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="DE4"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Water-Using Planning </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: The State of Delaware's Department
of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) is responsible for
managing the state's water resources. An important recreational resource
in the state is Delaware's inland bays (a series of three connecting bays:
Rehoboth, Indian River, and Little Assawoman). The bays have been designated
a National Estuary by EPA, and considerable planning has taken place to
improve water quality and other environmental conditions. Planning for
recreational uses of the bays is also an important consideration. The University
of Delaware Sea Grant MAS (UDSGMAS) program conducted a vital study of
recreational boating activity on the bays during the summer of 1992 and
prepared a report entitled &quot;Recreational Boating on Delaware's Inland
Bays: Implications for Social and Environmental Carrying Capacity.&quot;
The report is being used to help in the development of a water- use plan
for the bays. UDSGMAS continues to be an active participant on the committee
appointed to formulate the plan. We formed a Water-Use Plan subcommittee
which met during 1995 to address key issues of water-use planning. Delaware
Sea Grant has submitted a proposal to the Delaware Center for the Inland
Bays for funding consideration to develop an Inland Bays Water-Use Plan.
Work will begin in June, 1996 and be completed by June 1997. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="DE5"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Nature-Based Tourism Activity
in Delaware </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: A number of organizations including
Delaware Sea Grant, Delaware Tourism Office, Delaware State Parks, County
Tourism Offices, Chambers of Commerce and the private business sector have
embarked on an effort to bring nature-based tourism (or ecotourism) to
the forefront. Two successful ecotourism conferences have been held (November
1994 and March 1996). We have formed an informal Ecotourism Work Group
and are in the process of developing a guide to ecotourism in Delaware.
We are in the process of discussing the formation of a non-profit ecotourism
association for the state. This program area is just beginning to gain
momentum, so time will tell if its something we can keep going. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="DE6"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Delaware Recreational Boating
Study </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: During the summer of 1995 more
than 1,000 Delaware-registered boaters were sent mail surveys to solicit
information on attitudes, perceptions and opinions on a number of activities
related to recreational boating in Delaware waters. The results provide
information for boating officials, boating facility planners and educators
and enforcement personnel to better meet the needs of the boating public.
in addition, specific questions were also directed at the high percentage
of boat fishermen to obtain opinions on important sportfishing related
issues. A final report has been delivered to the contracting agency, however
additional information will continue to be culled from the database for
various uses. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="DE7"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Charter and Headboat Fishing
Study </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: During the Fall of 1995 more than
130 Delaware Charter and Headboat captains were sent mail surveys to begin
to characterize this segment of the fishing industry. The work was supported
by a grant from the Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife. The responses
from captains provides insight into their opinion on management, the targeted
species they fish for, and fishing activity and patterns during the 1995
fishing season. The final report is currently being reviewed by the contracting
agency. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="DE8"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Delmarva Coastal Bays Resident
Survey </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: During the winter of 1996 more
than 1,100 mail surveys were sent to residents of the three Delmarva (DE,
MD and VA) states living near the stateUs coastal bays. The purpose of
the survey was to gain insight from RstakeholdersS how they feel about
the environmental, economic and social conditions of their stateUs coastal
bays. The goal was to have preliminary data to present at a coastal bays
conference held in March 1996. The preliminary information was useful to
help lead discussion on key issues that the respondents voiced in their
returned questionnaires. A more-detailed analysis of the data will continue
and a final report will be prepared to disseminate to conference participants
and others. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="DE9"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Assessing Recreational Boating
Use Conflicts on the Nanticoke River </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: A local community group, the Nanticoke
Watershed Alliance has voiced concerns that boating activity on this relatively
pristine river has increased in the last few years. Much of the activity
is in the form of jet-skiers which also interferes with the commercial
barge traffic on the river. The river flows from Delaware into MarylandUs
Chesapeake Bay and both state resource agencies have been contacted regarding
the perceived problems. Delaware Sea Grant was also contacted to provide
technical advice and assistance. At the present time, it was agreed by
all parties, that an assessment of the boating impacts should be undertaken
to accurately describe the conditions on the river. Delaware Sea Grant
will provide a leadership role in this effort. Once that is completed outreach
methods or other regulatory approaches can be employed to alleviate any
problems that are identified. The assessment will begin during the summer
of 1996.</P>

Keys </P>

<P>B: BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: The condition of Florida Bay has
caused wide-spread concern throughout South Florida, and has received major
media attention, including a lengthy article in a recent issue of Sports
Illustrated. </P>

<P>To help address this problem Florida Sea Grant has established a low
power radio station that provides motorists and boaters with information
about the Bay. </P>

<P>Updated monthly, each broadcast highlights several of the more than
70 research projects dedicated to solving a wide range of environmental
problems afflicting the bay. The broadcasts also provide listeners with
information on what they can do to help protect the bay. In addition, the
broadcasts include a message from Jimmy Buffet and the the latest NOAA
weather forecast for the area. </P>

<P>Later in the year a number of surveys will be completed and analyzed
to determine the effectiveness of the low-power radio approach for communicating
with large audiences. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="FL2"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Anchorage Management </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: The Florida Sea Grant Extension
Program has taken a leadership role to address a nonregulatory approach
to anchorage management in Florida. Anchorage of vessels in FloridaUs coastal
zone has been a complicated and controversial problem for state and local
governments throughout the state. Environmental, social and aesthetic concerns
of the public, shore side land owners and government officials has led
to an uncoordinated, unpredictable and many times over-restrictive disarray
of local rules and regulations that irritate boaters seeking an anchorage
for their vessels. State agencies did not know how to address the problems
created by this dilemma without invoking strict regulations that would
create some consistency to anchorage laws in Florida. </P>

<P>This project is designed to test the feasibility of a non-regulatory
approach to anchorage management. Florida Sea Grant has entered into a
cooperative agreement with the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation
to develop components of an educational program that would serve to encourage
peer pressure and educational programs to realize self regulated anchorage
management among boaters. This pilot program is based on the premise supported
by prior research, that instruments of Rfriendly persuasion,S as detailed
map and guide materials, can influence boater behavior, and provide an
effective non-regulatory approach to bay management. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="FL3"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Educational Tools for Improving
Catch and Release Bladder Venting Practices of the Florida Charter Fishing
Industry </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Hook and line caught reef fishes
from deep water often suffer overexpansion injuries. Many of these fish
are illegal to keep and must be released. Even if released these fish often
die. Simple bladder venting techniques can significantly improve survivorship
of these released fish. Through the use of a project advisory committee
representing fisheries management, extension education, and the charter
industry, current knowledge on the best techniques for releasing reef fish
with over expansion injuries will be synthesized into easily used and understood
educational tools. Accomplishments of the project and educational materials
produced include: 1) A highly efficient and easy to use venting tool was
developed, manufactured and distributed to charter and head boats throughout
the state of Florida 2) Diagrammatic and explanatory fact sheets have been
printed and are being distributed to charter and head boats throughout
Florida 3) Diagrammatic and explanatory plastic placards have been produced
and distributed to head and charter boats for onboard display throughout
Florida. 4) Four workshops and 10 dockside consultations have provided
educational programs for charter and head boat operators and their crews
to transfer the information and introduce the venting tool. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="FL4"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Master Angler Program </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: This first ever for North East
Florida, Master Angler Volunteer Training Program has had a successful
start in this region. Fifteen master Anglers from Duval, Baker, St. Johns
and Clay Counties were successfully trained. They exhibited acceptable
knowledge gained and proficiency in: knowledge about the history and mission
of 4H; ways 4H youth programs work; youth development and methods for building
good attitudes in youth through family fishing experiences; salt and fresh
water fishing techniques; coastal issues impacting marine and fresh water
fishes; salt and freshwater fishing laws; ways to organize and lead youth
fishing events and how to encourage youth to develop 4H marine projects.
</P>

<P>A. <A NAME="FL5"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: GIS Information Database
As a Rural Tourism Planning Tool </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: The Geographical Information System
(GIS) is an excellent tool for planning and evaluating tourism resources
within a community. It provides an excellent tool for evaluating spatial
relationships of facilities and resources, studying carrying capacity of
a given natural resource as well as providing an overall look at resources
within a political jurisdiction. GIS databases have been used for numerous
functions in the planning process. In Putnam County, Florida this system
has been applied to the analysis, planning and implementation in developing
a nature based tourism program. In a search of literature, this is one
of the first documented applications of the GIS database specifically applied
to tourism. Geological Positioning System (GPS) equipment used is being
improved to make methodology of GIS application to tourism much easier.
This system will be utilized in other Florida counties in the months ahead,
pending receipt of a technology development grant. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="FL6"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Florida Boaters' nd Anglers'
Pledge Program </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: To help clean up Florida Bay boaters
are being encouraged to make a personal commitment towards keeping the
bay clean. In return for taking the Boaters' and Anglers' Pledge, boaters
receive a colorful decal from Florida Sea Grant to display and to designate
their boat as one whose owners really care about the quality of the stateUs
waters. Over 40,000 pledges have been made by boaters and anglers as of
this report. A booklet was produced that offers a wide array of suggestion
on environmentally safe boating and stresses the need for using pump out
stations, choosing non-toxic cleaning products, and recycling batteries,
plastics, solvents and other materials familiar to boaters. This educational
program has been further publicized through an inaugural event at Florida
Sea World and distribution of brochures, T-shirts, coupons to Sea World,
posters, and RFishing LinesS a publication of Florida Department of Environmental
Protection. The sponsors of this program include The Gulf of Mexico Program
- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Florida Sea Grant Extension Program,
University of Florida, IFAS Cooperative Extension Service, The Florida
Coastal management Program, The Center for Marine Conservation, Department
of Environmental Protection , and Keep Florida Beautiful, Inc.</P>

<P>A. <A NAME="GA1"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Marine Services Guide to
Coastal Georgia: </P>

<P>B. DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: The Marine Services Guide to Coastal
Georgia is a very popular guide that was first created and published in
1992. The guide became very popular with boating tourists and recreational
anglers. As the state has worked towards a coastal zone management program,
the coastal area has been re-defined as being two counties deep and subsequently,
another four counties have been added to the existing six. The guide will
now be further expanded to include the new counties. The guide will also
be updated to include the new facilities that have been built, expanded
or modernized as coastal Georgia experiences a burst of rapid expansion
in the marine businesses, recreational and tourist sector. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="GA2"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Coastal County Fishing Maps:
</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Coastal county fishing maps were
first printed in 1981 and since that time thousands have been distributed
to recreational anglers and boaters. With the growth of coastal tourism
and increasing recreational boating and angling the maps will now be updated
to include the new facilities that have been built or are currently being
constructed. The maps include tables indicating the seasonal locations
and identifying the availability of fish species that can be caught in
Georgia's coastal waters. On the reverse sides of the maps are educational

<P>A. <A NAME="GA3"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Marina Sewage Pump-Out Facilities</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: With the assistance of the Georgia
Marine Advisory Service, federal funding for pump-out units at coastal
marinas was received in time for the Olympic sailing events in Savannah.
Under a program administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the
Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) applied for the funds a year
ago, but substantial preliminary work was necessary before their application
was approved. Working as a subcontractor under DNR, Georgia's Marine Advisory
Service conducted a boat density survey and also devised a generic application
for marina owners. The efforts paid off for coastal marine visitors; four
pump-out units were installed and on line in time for the Olympics.</P>

<P>A. <A NAME="GA4"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Formation of the Georgia
Marine Business Association</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: The Georgia Sea Grant Program played
an instrumental role in the formation of the Georgia Marine Business Association.
One of the Association's primary functions is to monitor legislative and
regulatory activities in an attempt to determine their affects on marine
business activity. It also works to enhance the expansion of the recreational
boating industry in the state. The Association helped organize marinas,
boat yards, boat and motor dealers, and marine service companies into an
alliance to promote the marine industry and to assist legislators at both
state and federal levels in formulating or modifying laws and regulations.
</P>

<P>A. <A NAME="GA5"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Educational Workshops and
Field Trips</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: The Georgia Sea Grant Program provides
support that contributes to the expansion of marinas, and to the recreational
boating and marine service businesses. Sea Grant has sponsored educational
workshops and field trips to examine dry-stack storage options, boat washing
and service areas that meet nonpoint source requirements, underground fuel
storage tank regulations, and the insurance requirements of marine-related
businesses. A workshop on corrosion in the marine environment is held regularly
for boat owners and marina maintenance staff. Satellite video conference
equipment is used to keep the Georgia marine business community abreast
of developments at the national level through a University of Wisconsin
satellite video broadcast.</P>

<P>A. <A NAME="HA1"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Statewide Day-Use Moorings
</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: In December 1992, Sea Grant, DBEDT
Ocean Resources Branch, TORCH, and Malama Kai Foundation cosponsored a
statewide workshop on day-use moorings to provide current information on
day-use mooring technology and applications, as well as to identify environmental
and other concerns. In 1993, we prepared an environmental assessment for
the statewide day-use mooring system with assistance from the state DBEDT
Ocean Resources Branch and TORCH. The environmental assessment was required
to meet federal and state requirements relating to environmental impact
statements and various necessary permits. Permits for installation of mooring
buoys at Molokini Shoals MLCD were issued by the state DOBOR; during summer
1994, in cooperation with DBEDT, TORCH, and volunteers, 19 buoys were installed.
The state DOBOR has also proceeded with an application for a U.S. Corps
of Engineers Section 10 permit and CZM federal consistency review. Once
all requirements are met, probably in 1994, Sea Grant and DBEDT will work
with TORCH to begin installation of moorings. A database has been designed
for the 50 existing moorings in West Hawaii. The database includes location,
description, maintenance schedule, and use. A database users' guide, data
input forms, and boaters' guide have been drafted. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="HA2"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Eco/Heritage Tourism </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: The purpose of this program area
is to assist in the development of ecotourism opportunities in the state.
In 1991, Hawaii Sea Grant hosted and helped organize the Heritage Interpretation
International's Third global Congress in Honolulu, in cooperation with
a number of government agencies, tourism organizations, and nonprofits.
Sea Grant assisted with the Hawaii Visitors Bureau Environment Conferences
held in 1992 and 1993, as well as the reorganized DBEDT State Conference
on Ecotourism held in October 1994. In all of these conferences, we contributed
to general program planning and organization, organized specific sessions,
and ensured a forum for discussing issues relating to coastal recreation
and tourism (e.g., eco/heritage tourism planning and development, fish
feeding controversy, &quot;green&quot; practices, ecotourism guidelines,
community involvement in tourism planning). During 1994, the national director
and a program associate from the National Trust for Historic Preservation's
Heritage Tourism Program made presentations in Hawaii to over 300 individuals
on the principles of heritage tourism planning and how to get started.
This effort over the years has led to our involvement in the formation
of the Hawaii Ecotourism Association, a nonprofit educational organization
that will be a resource to ecotourism businesses, governmental policy-makers,
and communities. </P>

with signs in final production. On Hawaii Island, signage at the Old Kona
Airport State Park and Kealakekua Bay are in progress. We continue to work
with the National Association for Interpretation's Resource Interpretation
and Heritage Tourism (RIHT) Section in enhancing professional development
opportunities for interpreters in the visitor industry (e.g., tour guides).
The RIHT was actively involved on the program committee for NAI's 1995
conference in Florida that highlighted heritage tourism and interpretation
as a program track. Sea Grant will be sponsoring future workshops on new
approaches, technologies, and methods for interpreting coastal areas for
residents and visitors, especially with regard to scenic/heritage corridors
and other visitor destination areas. A community-based brochure project
for South Maui will highlight visitor attractions featuring natural and
cultural resources, as well as bike paths, jogging routes, and trails.</P>

Education Program </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: The purpose of this program is
to have students, the boating public, and commercial boat operators become
aware of basic water and boating safety practices, and to have both residents
and visitors adopt safe boating practices. </P>

<P>SGES has been assisting the state with a Coast Guard-funded boating
safety education project since 1990. The first phase, which ended in early
1992, focused on background research, overall planning and development
of materials for Grades 4-6. A resource file of boating safety educational
materials from other states was also completed. A steering committee, including
representatives from the state DOE, City and County of Honolulu, and US
Coast Guard, was formed to coordinate water and boating safety education
projects. Boating safety videos aimed at 7-8 graders have been produced
that combine action-packed footage and interviews with locally well-known
ocean sports personalities; activities such as skimboarding, surfing, and
bodysurfing are featured. Phase III has expanded to include hazard and
disaster preparation for boaters. </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Hanauma Bay is the most popular
beach attraction in the state outside of Waikiki. With restrictions on
commercial operations established by the City and County of Honolulu in
1990, the daily visitation has declined somewhat, but there is still an
average of 6,000-8,000 visitors per day. Funded in part by the state, county,
and private sources, the program helps visitors appreciate the Bay's natural
and cultural history, and more importantly, avoid harming the marine environment
by activities such as fish feeding and trampling on the reef. The program
offers a variety of educational programs including guided tours, wayside
exhibits, publications and audio-visual presentations. Among its immediate
priorities are to establish a mandatory orientation on marine preservation
before entering the water and to secure long-range funding. </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Louisiana Sea Grant continues to
work on outdoor recreation resource management and issues through its active
participation on Louisiana Recreational Fishing Development Board and the
Recreation, Tourism and Wildlife (RTW) Committee of the Office of State
Parks. The Recreational Fishing Development Board was created by the state
legislature in 1990 and in 1995 Sea Grant assisted the Board in the preparation
of a strategic plan. Sea Grant is a voting member of the 21-person Board.
The RTW Committee, an Office of State Parks Advisory panel, helps advise
Sea Grant on its outdoor recreation programming. </P>

<P>A. TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Organizational Support - Private and Public
Sectors </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Sea Grant reaches a large tourism
audience through its close work with the Louisiana Travel Promotion Association
(LTPA), a trade association with over 800 members. About 80 percent of
the membership is from rural areas. Sea Grant participates in the education
sessions of an annual Tourism and Travel Summit that is sponsored by LTPA
and the Department of Culture, Recreation, and Tourism. Ms. Marilyn Barrett
also contributes an educational column for Update, a monthly newsletter
published by LTPA. </P>

<P>In 1992, Louisiana Sea Grant was instrumental in establishing the Lt.
Governor's Rural Tourism Development TaskForce, as well as the Division
of Rural Tourism within the state Department of Culture, Recreation and
Tourism and has continued to play an active role in planning and educational
activities. The primary role of the task force is to assist the Division
of Rural Tourism in its information transfer activities. Task force membership
includes individuals from state agencies and institutions, as well as the
private sector. Mr. Michael Liffmann has served as chairman of the task
force during its first year. Ms. Margaret Moore of the Louisiana Cooperative
Extension Service serves as the 1993-94 chairman. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="LA2"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Tourism and Sustainable Development
</P>

<P>Tourism is now viewed as a viable economic development strategy by most
of Louisiana's coastal communities. There is, however, a well-founded concern
for the natural and cultural resources that are called upon to sustain
this industry. Louisiana does not have an outstanding record of preservation
and conservation of its resources. Therefore, Louisiana Sea Grant works
with resource management agencies, environmental organizations, selected
businesses, and the tourism industry to identify ways that these resources
can be promoted and put to use without compromising their future. </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Louisiana Sea Grant continues to
couple tourism and sustainable development in its assessments of recreation
and tourism development for coastal parishes. The process used to asses
communities is the rapid appraisal process which was adapted from methods
developed by British, other international agricultural experts, and Oregon
Sea Grant. This method is based on a special team approach to gather information
and provide assistance in areas where dollars for studies and other forms
of technical assistance are scarce. In 1994 at the request of local leaders,
an assessment was done of Grand Isle, a barrier island community with a
population base of 2,000 that swells to 30,000 visitors during major spring
and summer events. The assessment team generated information that was finalized
into a report that helped identify tourism and recreation resources that
while remaining sensitive to environmental stewardship matters could diversify
markets and lengthen the tourist season for this small community. </P>

<P>Through a project funded by the Economic Development Administration
Louisiana Sea Grant is currently working with nine coastal parishes on
the development of an economic adjustment strategy for coastal Louisiana.
The broad scope of economic, environmental, sociologic and political data
and issues that must be considered in crafting and implementing a viable
coastal economic adjustment strategy demands a very pragmatic approach
and comprehensive involvement by state and local governments, the industrial
sector, academia, and local citizens. In conjunction with this project
an assessment will be done in the summer of 1996 in Plaquemines parish
which will serve as a pilot project for using the rapid rural appraisal
method for all sectors of economic development including tourism and recreation.
Heretofore, Louisiana Sea Grant community assessments have been limited
to recreation and tourism development. </P>

The focus has been on education and development of regional as well as
private-public partnerships, and helping build an information and assistance
network among the communities. </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Since its inception in 1987, this
program has focused on training state and local tourism leaders. Following
several site-specific studies in the late 1980s, a statewide needs assessment
study in 1990 helped identify a more specific education agenda. The program
has been very successful and the following are some of its more recent
highlights. </P>

<P>The Tourist Commissioner Series published quarterly by the Louisiana
Sea Grant College Program. The Series is designed to help meet the &quot;how
to&quot; needs of 350 appointed tourist commissioners statewide. The first
issue (January 1994), &quot;Introducing... The Position of Tourist Commissioner&quot;,
serves as a primer for this new audience. The second issue, &quot;Setting
a Commission's Goals and Objectives&quot; and RThe Then Most Asked Questions
About FundingS have also been published in this series. An issue on RSustainable
DevelopmentS is scheduled to be published in the fall of 1996. </P>

<P>An ongoing effort entails involving the extensive resources of the Louisiana
Cooperative Extension Services (LCES) in rural tourism matters. The results
have been positive. The Louisiana Rural Tourism Development Conference,
which is annual and statewide, is organized and cosponsored by Sea Grant

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Louisiana Sea Grant became involved
with research, education, and outreach relative to the nonindigeneous species
Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussels) in 1993 when scientists began to suggest
that migration down the Mississippi into the Southern region was possible,
and even probable. Joining with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Fishery
Resource Office in the state, Sea Grant initiated outreach and education
through a workshop and production of an informational brochure. </P>

<P>During the summer 1995, Louisiana Sea Grant conducted a pilot program
at Toledo Bend Reservoir, surveying recreational boaters to determine the
boating patterns and level of zebra mussel awareness of the recreational
boaters. Outreach in the form of posters and brochures was also provided.
</P>

<P>Louisiana Sea Grant is also developing a informational computer program
designed for teachers and/or librarians. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="LA6"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Marinas </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Louisiana Sea Grant become involved
with nonpoint sources of pollution relative to marinas, participating early
on in the organization of the Clean Marina Program and its successor foundation.
An outreach project to educate marina clients about nonpoint source pollution
and aquatic environment, piloted with three marinas on Lake Pontchartrain
in the spring of 1994, was improved and continued with four marinas in
1995 and 1996. In the latter two years, the participating marinas provided
outreach to about 1,000 recreational boaters using the lake. In these projects,
each marina constructs an outdoor bulletin board for the purpose of displaying
environmental information for recreational boaters. The displays are maintained
by Louisiana Sea Grant, and changed monthly. Education materials on related
nonpoint source pollution topics, published by Sea Grant, by the Louisiana
Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, the Louisiana Department of Natural
Resources, and the New Orleans Nature and Science Center are also provided.
The topics focus on sewage and pumpout facilities, proper disposal of trash
and litter generated on board, disposal of used engine oil and other operations
wastes, and general conservation of the aquatic environment. </P>

<P>The Marina and Boatyard Association of Louisiana (MBAL) was organized
in fall 1994 and held its second annual meeting in conjunction with the
Marina Environmental management Workshop in Biloxi, Mississippi, in November,
1995. the fist meeting took place in Covington. Owners and operators have
been encouraged to join this trade association in order to more easily
seek education, help each other, and work together as a unit to secure
governmental attention and assistance. </P>

<P>The Louisiana Marina Directory was updated in the summer of 1995. Some
150+ marinas were surveyed and information was obtained on services and
facilities available at these marinas that is included in the directory.
</P>

<P>A national network of marinas and marine-related trades, MarinaNet,
was established in 1995 through the Sea Grant College program when Louisiana
Sea Grant joined with Sea Grant programs in Rhode Island, New Jersey, Texas,
Florida, Michigan, and Oregon, in a two-year project to expand the existing
informal network of Sea Grant researchers and outreach staff that work
with marina operators. MarinaNet publishes a newsletter, is developing
on-line communications, and has plans to conduct a conference to link Sea
Grant with industry activities, identify marine-related research needs,
and publish a national environmental catalog which inventories Sea Grant
activities and research relevant to the marina industry. </P>

Boating in Maryland </P>

<P>B: BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: In 1994, an extensive economic
survey and analysis of recreational boaters was carried out in Maryland.
The study queried a sample of 1,159 owners of Maryland-registered boats,
which were representative of the 190,000 boats registered in the state.
The economic impact of boating was found to be significant. Every 10.5
registered or documented boats in Maryland were shown to be equivalent
to one full-time job and the Total Annual Spending (trip plus boat related
expenses plus new and used boat purchases) by each boater averaged $5,311.
Researchers placed an additional economic output value of $5,136 for the
average $5,311 spent for each boat registered in Maryland. The study also
found that sailboaters outspend powerboaters in average annual boat-related
expenditures. This study resulted in a publication RRecreational Boating
in Maryland - An Economic Impact StudyS. </P>

Upper Peninsula coastal communities. </P>

<P>B: BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Every summer, hundreds of transient
boaters flock from their home ports to MichiganUs Upper Peninsula marinas
where they stay overnight. Research began in 1988 to attempt to better
characterize this group of boaters and their role in local economies. These
studies, the latest completed in 1994, outline travel patterns, common
sources of information, average party sizes, average ages of skippers and
crew members, amount of money spent by transient boaters at marinas and
in nearby communities, and more. A number of participating communities
have considered this information when creating waterfront development and
revitalization plans. These reports help predict the behavior of transient
boaters in the Upper Peninsula and aid in developing strategies to attract
more boaters to particular areas by meeting their needs. Two recently complete
transient boater studies, <I>Upper Peninsula of Michigan Lake Superior

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Sea Grant has been a working partner
with Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, City of Duluth and 3 other
local governments to find an acceptable solution to satisfy boater access
needs to Lake Superior in the Duluth area and also satisfy residents and
others with environmental concerns about development of the Lake Superior
shoreline. Over a 10 year period, public boat launch sites have been rejected,
sometimes under great controversy. The current effort is organized differently
and is meeting success. A committee formed by Duluth's mayor brings together
citizens, government representatives and technical experts with all points
of view. Sea Grant is a technical advisor on this committee. Operating
by consensus rather than by majority rule, the group has slowly come to
agreement on all of the issues for a public boating access site. The project
is an excellent demonstration of using an alternative approach to meeting
development and protection needs to the satisfaction of all interested
parties. While the process is slow (currently 2 1/2 years), there has been
virtually no controversy and only minor objection. The project is currently
funded by the state legislature for land purchase and final design. An
abstract of the project will be in The Coastal Society 15th International
Conference Proceedings (July, 1996). </P>

little expertise in how to analyze local resources for tourism and how
to proceed to develop a tourism sector. To provide a resource that small
towns could use to develop tourism, the University of Minnesota Tourism
Center with support from Minnesota Sea Grant created a tourism training
program. The program utilizes a 330 page training guide along with an excellent
case study video. The materials describe the issues related to tourism
development and suggest how to proceed. The program is titled, &quot;A
Training Guide for Rural Tourism Development.&quot; Case studies show rural
tourism communities in Idaho, Colorado, Georgia, and Iowa. Fifty two other

<P>A. <A NAME="NC3"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Economic Impact of the Bluefin
Tuna Sport Fishery on Hatteras Island, North Carolina </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: For the past three years, bluefin
tuna have been concentrating in Atlantic waters near Hatteras Inlet on
the Outer banks of North Carolina. The fish are appearing in December and
staying into April. As a result, Hatteras Island has evolved from a sleepy
commercial fishing village in the off season into a destination for bluefin
tuna anglers from around the world. One interesting side light to this
fishery is that very few fish are being harvested by the charter boats
or the parties charting the boats. Many customers are happy to tag and
release the fish even when the charter boat has a permit to harvest certain
classes of fish. Researchers and fishery regulators make up another group
of frequent visitors to the Island. The large concentrations of bluefin
tuna in relatively shallow water and close to shore are providing excellent
opportunities for biologists to collect research data that was previously
difficult or impossible to collect. NMFS personnel are spending considerable
time in Hatteras monitoring the fishery in order to manage bluefin tuna
quotas. Over the next three to six months, we will be assembling economic
information and writing an economic impact study for the new bluefin tuna
sport fishery on Hatteras Island. In addition to the economic data assessment,
three short publications related to the fishery will also be completed:

<P>A. <A NAME="NC4"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Enhancing Tourism and Mariculture
Development through U-pick-It Clam Leases </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: While opportunities for making
a living from commercial fishing have declined in recent years, tourism
has grown as a major element in the economies of coastal communities. Most
watermen do not have the skills or inclination to enter the growing tourism
economy. Because of problems with access, lack of knowledge about shellfishing
practices and lack of equipment, most inland visitors to the coast are
precluded from participating in shellfishing. The purpose of the partnership
between private business, Sea Grant and NCRI that is being described here
is to couple traditional watermen's skills with opportunities provided
by the tourism economy through development of u-pick-it shellfish farms.
The goals of the project are to: 1)increase employment, profitability and
production of mariculture operations, 2)enhance the coastal tourism base
by providing additional recreational activities 3) develop educational
products to inform tourists about shellfishing and the emerging mariculture
industry and 4)develop a manual and video on how to establish a business
which will include information on selecting a site, costs and returns,
marketing and liability. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="NC5"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: The Green Stick-Commercial
and Recreational Tuna Gear </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: The &quot;Green Stick&quot; is
a fiberglass pole ranging in length from 27-42 feet that is used by commercial
and recreational tuna fishermen. It now comes in many colors and designs
and is manufactured by more than one company but is still referred to locally
as the &quot;green stick&quot; or the &quot;stick&quot;. The stick is generally
rigged with several hundred yards of heavy monofilament line, five to seven
hooks with artificial lures and a &quot;shava&quot; or bird at the end
of the line. With an origin in Japan, the green stick technique of fishing
tuna reached North Carolina via Hawaii and an avid tuna fisherman locally.
Success stories among local tuna fishermen of 5 or 10 to 1 using the stick
compared to conventional methods have spread rapidly, creating an unfulfilled
demand for the equipment. A Green Stick publication is nearly complete
which will describe how to rig the Green Stick and techniques for its use.
There are many variations to the &quot;green stick&quot;, the bird, the
baits and to the way it is rigged. This publication offers watermen an
excellent introduction and &quot;how to&quot; for rigging and fishing the
equipment. Workshops for tuna fishermen are planned for late April and
early May. </P>

<P>A.. <A NAME="NC6"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Rip Current Video </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: A search for funding to produce
a five minute educational rip current video and complimentary PSAs is presently
underway. Rip currents are a continual hazard to North Carolina beach users
and claim numerous lives every year. It has been suggested that many of
the deaths could be prevented with proper education. The problem is reaching
potential water users and beach goers with an educational message about
potentially deadly rip currents. Chances look very good that Dare County
and the Dare County Tourist Bureau will fund the rip current video. If
all goes as planned, the video will be available by mid summer for distribution
to tourist contact stations, cottage owner/managers, television stations
and other agencies with visitor contact potential </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="NC7"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Dare County Visitor Conversion
Study </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Sea Grant will be working very
closely with the Dare County Tourist Bureau and Dr. Rick Perdue in efforts
to design and implement an &quot;in house&quot; inquiry conversion/visitor
study. The purpose of the study will be to determine how many of the people
who make inquiries actually visit Dare County, gather demographics about
visitors, stratify promotional vehicles according to the type of media
and assess the return on investment from promotional efforts. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="NC8"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: International Bluefin Tuna
Scientific Research Roundup </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Assist with the organization of
a research oriented bluefin tuna recreational fishing tournament in Hatteras,
NC. The idea of the tournament is to allow recreational fishermen to sponsor
the implant of an &quot;archival data tag&quot; into a bluefin tuna the
angler catches during the tournament. There will also be more expensive
&quot;pop-up&quot; tags available which may be attached externally by the
anglers crew. prizes will be awarded at a later date based on how far the
tagged tuna travel, when the first tag is recovered, and perhaps other
categories to be determined. This will be a cooperative effort including
the Hatteras Civic Association, researchers, and a group of interested
boat captains. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="OH1"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Ohio Tourism Business Retention
and Expansion Programs </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Ohio Sea Grant Extension has collaborated
with the Ohio Business Retention and Expansion Program (BRE) to carry out
tourism focused BRE programs in seven of Ohio's eight coastal counties.
Many coastal states either have or have access to BRE programs conducted
by the Cooperative Extension Service, the state department of development,
or a local utility. The core of the BRE program consists of a series of
business visits using a standardized questionnaire carried out by local
volunteers seeking to learn about business concerns and needs and then
determining how to address those concerns and needs. The program is coordinated
by a Task Force of 10-20 local leaders whose responsibility it is to solicit
volunteer visitors, see that immediate issues (called red flags) are addressed,
and to develop an action plan to address major longer term concerns. The
only difference between a tourism focused program and industrial or general
retail focused programs is the selection of businesses whose primary orientation
is to visitors. Major business concerns focus on labor force capabilities,
local services, compliance with or use of local and state programs, and
customers. </P>

<P>In addition to the basic BRE process, we have developed a means of conducting
visitors surveys with the local convention and visitors bureaus (CVB) either
as part of the BRE program or as a separate component either before or
after the BRE program. In many cases, the local CVB, being responsible
for marketing the recreational aspects of the area and thereby increasing
the customer base of the tourism oriented businesses, has a poor picture
of the visitor base and lacks the resources to hire a consultant to conduct
a visitors survey. We worked out a collaborative arrangement whereby the
CVB contacts visitors on a stratified random basis, using employees already
on the payroll if possible, and mails the surveys to the contacted visitors.
Sea Grant or BRE compiles the data, tabulates the results, and writes the
report. The cost to the CVBs has been 25-30% of the cost of hiring a consultant
as long as sufficient employee time can be freed to do the visitor contacts
and the mailings. </P>

<P>Six tourism BRE programs were conducted under a development grant from
the National Coastal Resources Institute during 1991-93. A total of 256
tourism-related businesses employing 8,811 workers were visited. Of 4,500
tourism customers surveyed, 1658 returned completed questionnaires for
a 37 percent response rate. These two data bases provided information to
local development professionals about business development needs and to
visitors bureaus about visitor needs and behaviors. A survey of 119 tourism
program leaders and businesses in the first three programs completed was
conducted to evaluate the tourism program; 39 responded for a 33 percent
response rate. Thirteen respondents were program leaders and 26 were businesses.
The program leaders rated the program more highly because they were more
aware of program accomplishments while business respondents tended to know
only about program impacts on their particular business. While 64 percent
of all respondents would recommend the R&amp;E program to other communities,
92 percent of program leaders made that recommendation. </P>

<P>In Lucas County during 1995, the first large urban area tourism R&amp;E
program visited 60 tourism oriented businesses. A 1993 visitors survey
saw 257 responses from a sample of 500 visitors. The resulting action plan
adopted four action goals: 1) to strengthen the Greater Toledo CVB marketing
plan, 2) to improve the means of disseminating information to tourism oriented
businesses, 3) to support and strengthen existing efforts to revitalize
downtown Toledo, and 4) to develop an area business network to foster communications
among tourism oriented businesses.</P>

<P>A. <A NAME="OR1"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Recreational Boating Safety
</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: With recreational river cruising
on the Columbia River escalating at an unprecedented pace, boater use days
increased 67% in the past ten years and it is estimated this will increase
in the next ten years. The Columbia and Willamette River systems dominate
the boating picture and account for one half of all boating. Oregon is
addressing boater safety needs while striving to protect sensitive natural
resource areas. </P>

<P>The Oregon State Marine Board and Oregon Sea Grant have collaboratively
undertaken a pilot study to identify potential transient moorage sites
along two coastal rivers: The Columbia and the Willamette. A network of
public transient tie-up facilities will disperse activity and benefit the
boating and river communities by providing additional recreational opportunities.
Studies along two stretches of the river have been completed and two more
are planned for 1994. The study includes site appraisal of potential locations,
a recreational boater survey, and direct consultation with agencies knowledgeable
of and directly involved with the resources of these rivers. To date more
than $1 million in new facilities have been built using these study results.
</P>

<P>During the spring of 1996, a bi-state workshop jointly sponsored with
Washington Sea Grant was held to set system-wide priorties for boating
access located within the two states.</P>

<P>A. <A NAME="OR2"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Boater Safety Computing Project</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Our project will create a computer-driven
multi media educational program on recreational boating safety. This entertaining
and educational tool will consist of a touch-screen presentation for use
by boat show participants and will be available for access on the World
Wide Web.</P>

<P>A. <A NAME="OR3"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Publication Evaluation: Boating
in Oregon's Coastal Waters</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: For more than two decades, the
Oregon Sea Grant Program and the Oregon State Marine Board have jointly
published a boating safety guide to the state's coastal inlets. While informal
feedback from various mariners has been positive, a formal survey of those
requesting the guide is now being conducted. The survey will provide insights
on the guide's use and value to mariners, while highlighting ways this
boating safety publication can be improved in the future. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="OR4"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Low Power Radio </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: In a cooperative effort with the
U. S. Coast Guard, local Government, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife
and the Columbia River Bar Pilots, Oregon Sea Grant is addressing traveler
safety on the air waves. The Oregon State Marine Board is using low power
AM radio along the Columbia River to provide boaters with information on
boating hazards, commercial ship traffic conflicts, weather and fishing
information. Signs along the highway and at launch ramps direct boaters
to tune in for this information which is updated daily using normal voice
mail technology. </P>

<P>Sea Grant Programs in New York State and Florida are now deploying this
technology for outreach education along roads and waterways. Marine enterprises
are testing small LPR units to evaluate the technology's usefulness for
marketing purposes. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="OR5"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Recreational Boating Impact
</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM: An Oregon State University study conducted
in 1986, indicated the presence of over 1800 firms providing water based
recreation goods and services. This information combined with trip expenditure
projections of boating related activities revealed this industry's contribution
of more than $50 million per annum to the Oregon economy. </P>

<P>Since that time, tremendous recreational boating activity has taken
place within Oregon waters. For instance, between 1982 and 1992, the total
number of boat use days increased in Oregon by about 67%. </P>

<P>To document the significance of Oregon's recreational boating industry,
Oregon Sea Grant is collaborating with the OSMB in conducting a systematic
study. This project will portray the scope and magnitude of Oregon's recreational
boating industry, including key trends and future implications of these
trends to achieving a sustainable industry. A full report and executive
summary of this study will be available for distribution in 1997. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="OR6"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Coastal Heritage: Living
Treasures of Clatsop County </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Clastop County is an area of great
diversity, bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the north by the
Columbia River estuary and encompassing forests, sandy beaches, rocky points,
sand dunes, river mouth, estuary lands, diked tideland, mud flats, mountains
and river valleys. It's rich history includes Chinook Indian settlements,
early visits by Lewis and Clark and Captain Robert Gray, establishment
of the first American settlement west of the Rocky Mountains, great fisheries
and logging activities. Descendants of early settlers still remain in this
area. Oregon Sea Grant embarked on a project in Clatsop County to give
visitors an opportunity to see and hear about this exceptional historical
area first hand. </P>

<P>Called &quot;The Living Treasures of Clastop County,&quot; Oregon Sea
Grant identified ten people who have the ability and willingness to talk
to others about themselves, their families and their experiences. These
&quot;human treasures&quot; may recount stories on their grandparent's
arrival to Oregon back in 1868; what gillnetting and fisheries were like
at the turn of the century; or perhaps even tell you about the &quot;daddys&quot;
train where fathers took the train from distant cities on weekends to join
their families vacationing at the beach. A Living Treasures booklet was
developed which is distributed to tour groups and conventions at local
motels. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="OR7"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Ecotourism Development </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: We have developed and taught a
class for ecotourism guides about the various areas of interest or concerns
that would be of interest to ecotourists. That class will be taught again
during the spring of 1996. </P>

<P>We have done a brochure about informational trips on the lower Columbia
and Willapa bay called Ecocharters. A local charterboat operator who does
such charters said that their non-fishing charters doubled the year those
brochures became avaiable. </P>

<P>With CREST we are in the process of publishing a manual for ecotourist
guides covering the same material we used in our class. It will be used
in the coming class as a textbook. I will be doing a number of classes
with ecotours mostly focusing on aspects of Columbia River salmon. These
include at least one elderhostel,one class with students from the area
regestered through Portland State University, and a number of days giving
tours and talks to visiting ships touring the lower Columbia. I am teaching
someone to do the tours and lectures for the boats. There are 14 planned
for 1996. </P>

</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Jim Good, Oregon Sea Grant's coastal
resource specialist, has been working with Oregon coastal and riverfront
communities to revitalize and redevelop their waterfronts since 1987. The
waterfront revitalization efforts focus on opportunities for marine-related
development, public access, and recreation and tourism development while
at the same time protecting natural resources. </P>

<P>Results are coming in. In 1993, the City of Reedsport, Oregon reached
a major milestone in its revitalization-- the completion of a 7,880 square-foot
interpretive center with exhibits focusing on the land, water, and people
of lower Umpqua River region. So far Reedsport has garnered 29 grants worth
nearly $2 million. Another city credits Oregon Sea Grant as the &quot;spark&quot;
that ignited the city's eastern edge of the Columbia River. </P>

<P>The Dalles has amassed most of the $20.5 million funding needed to break
ground for the Dalles Discovery Center and The Wasco County Museum to be
completed in 1996. Visitors are already using several new riverfront parks,
and the ten miles of new biking and hiking trails developed with the first
$1.1 million grant received. </P>

<P>In addition, the State Highway Department has committed almost $9 million
for a new freeway interchange in anticipation of the 500,000 annual visitors
expected as a result of these new development projects. </P>

<P>A two year national demonstration project, funded by the National Coastal
Resources Research Institute, in partnership with Washington Sea Grant
has been completed. Both Sea Grant programs worked with Warrenton, Oregon
and Raymond, Washington to help them develop waterfront revitalization
plans using Good and Goodwin's planning guide, &quot;Waterfront Revitalization
for Small Cities.&quot; The communities are making great progress implementing
their plans. A final report on the project is available from Washington
Sea Grant. (See <A HREF="#Washington">Washington Sea Grant)</A></P>

Coastal and Marine Tourism </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Coastal and marine activities based
on resources continue to be a major growth sector in international tourism.
In 1990, the first Congress on Coastal and Marine Tourism (CMT90) brought
together more than 250 participants from 31 nations and territories to
consider the nature of tourism in the coastal zone. Business and government
representatives, community leaders, and scientists agreed that successful,
sustainable tourism must be a careful blend of integrated planning and
development, with collaboration among communities, resource managers, industry,
education and not-for-profit organizations. The 1996 Congress will bring
together the same diverse interests to discuss, debate and create solutions
and strategies for sustainable tourism development in coastal locals. The
conference will be held June 19-22, 1996 in Honolulu, Hawaii. All participants
will be asked to share their experiences in managing and developing coastal
and marine tourism. Presentations and discussions will focus on case studies,
strategies, tools, and the affects of tourism. Technical sessions will
examine the concept of sustainable development and how to achieve it. Areas
of discussion may include industry and community policy, local or bottom-up
management, fisheries, integrated management and planning, carrying capacity,
water quality and education and interpretive programs. Printed abstracts
and proceedings will be available for purchase.</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Along with the growing numbers
of tourists on the Oregon coast is a marked increase in visitors to the
marine garden areas. Oregon Sea Grant has produced a rocky intertidal video
which emphasizes conservation of this fragile resource. This video provides
an introduction to the rocky intertidal habitat and the organisms that
live there and provides tips on how to visit with minimal disturbance to
the area. It emphasizes some of the recent research on trampling of the
intertidal area conducted by OSU researchers. The video will be distributed
to schools through the marine education program in Oregon. </P>

<P>A rocky shores interpretation volunteer program has been initiated in
the central coast area. Twenty Volunteers work at two fragile but heavily
used tidepool areason the central coast. Volunteers work the beaches on
low tide weekends. They distribute brochures and provide visitors with
tidepool conservation information. Since both tidepool areas are utilized
by seal pups during the spring, pup protection measure are conducted by
the volunteers. </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: The University of Puerto Rico Sea
Grant College Program Marine Advisory Service will be in charge of the
development of the education and outreach component of the Puerto Rico
Clean Vessel Act Program. The Puerto Rico Clean Vessel Act program will
employ the technical guidelines provided by the United States Fish and
Wildlife Service to 1) develop a statewide plan to reduce sewage pollution
from recreational vessels, and 2) develop an education/information plan
designed to educate a variety of targeted marine user groups.</P>

<P>The Puerto Rico Clean Vessel Act Program will be conducted as a partnership
among the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER), and the University
of Puerto Rico Sea Grant College Marine Advisory Service (MAS). The MAS
objectives under the program are to: 1) collaborate with federal and state
agencies in the establishment and implementation of the Puerto Rico Clean
Vessel Program; 2) help and advise the Commonwealth's Department of Natural
and Environmental Resources in the delivery of the proposed activities;
3) develop a statewide plan to reduce sewage pollution from recreational
vessels; and 4) coordinate with the DNER to develop an education and information
plan to address effectively the problem of boat waste disposal.</P>

<P>We expect the following benefits: 1) improvement of Puerto Rico's coastal
water quality through coordination among marina owners, boat users and
MAS agents; 2) a change in behavior of the recreational boat users responsible
for polluting coastal waters by offering them an alternative for sewage
disposal; 3) benefits to tourism, marine recreation, and the island's economy
by providing proper infrastructure and services related to pollution abatement;
and 4) a better-educated public and boating community, sensitive to the
problems created by untreated vessel-generated sewage in the coastal waters
of Puerto Rico. The first pumpout service is available in Marina Puerto
del Rey, Fajardo (PR East Coast). The service is free of charge. For service
call (787) 860-1000. Six new projects are under evaluation by the Management

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Rhode Island Sea Grant-Marine Advisory
Service is conducting a project titled &quot;Marina Outreach and Best Management
Practice Implementation.&quot; This project will: 1 Demonstrate and evaluate
the ease of pollution control as prescribed in the State's new Environmental
Guide for Marinas and accompanying regulation. This Guide was written by
Rhode Island Sea Grant in concert with the state regulatory agencies and
the marine trades association to meet the requirements of Section 6217
of The Coastal Zone Act Re-authorization Amendments (CZARA). It provides
a revised regulatory framework which reduces the regulatory burden on marinas
while achieving existing and new resource management goals and policies.
2. Educate boaters on the nature of the problem and the common sense solutions
that can be applied. 3. Share the lessons learned with the marina industry
and regulatory community at the state and national level. </P>

<P>By the end of the project, boaters, the marina industry, and relevant
regulatory agencies will have a better understanding of the need for and
proper implementation of economically achievable nonpoint source pollution
controls. </P>

<P><B>General Plan</B> The project will address sources of coastal nonpoint
pollution from recreational boating facilities, including marinas, yacht
clubs, and boatyards, within the Greenwich Bay study area. Greenwich Bay
is ranked as a priority water body for protection by Rhode Island's Nonpoint
Source Management Plan. This will be achieved by providing technical support
and funding for the development of operation and maintenance plans (OMPs)
and implementation of innovative management practices (BMPs) at five selected
marinas. Technical assistance includes direct personal interaction between
the marinas managers and the Sea Grant during the development of the OMPs
and implementation of BMPs that are cost effective, practical in the marina
environment and represent new solutions. When the demonstration component
of the project is complete the results will be shared with the entire Rhode
Island marina industry through a series of statewide workshop. During this
phase, the implementation and use of BMPs will also be monitored and evaluated
for their overall cost effectiveness and environmental compatibility. This
information will then be incorporated into a final written report which
summarizes the knowledge gained during the BMP implementation aspect of
the project </P>

<P><B>Funding</B> This project is being jointly funded by the participating
marina facilities and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management
(RIDEM), Office of Environmental Coordination, and Narragansett Bay Project.
Both RIDEM sources originate from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
approved grants written under Sections 319 and 320 of The Clean Water Act.</P>

start-up and operation. These products and other research results from
the first two years of this project are now being used in conjunction with
the second component, which is beginning it's second year. </P>

<P>The second program component is the &quot;Coastal Tourism Satellite
Enterprise Development Project&quot;. It is a project to create, demonstrate,
monitor and assess an approach to NBT in which visitors to high density
coastal tourism areas are drawn to adjacent rural areas by natural and
cultural resource attractions. </P>

<P>The purpose of the project is to encourage tourism activity in receptive
rural areas to promote business development and job creation. A unique
feature of the project is that it brings together all of the players (resource
managers, community leaders, representatives of the travel industry, and
NBT entrepreneurs) necessary for the sustainable use of natural and cultural
resources in coastal economic development. Other such efforts focus on
one or another of these groups, but not all of them. </P>

<P>Outcomes to date include a statewide NBT conference, an inventory of
SC NBT businesses and the formation of a SC NBT Association. Many of the
players involved in this project are also active in the NBT Ad Hoc Committee
(described above), imparting a synergistic quality to NBT program activity
in SC. </P>

<P>Both program components are NCRI funded projects coordinated through
the SCMEP.</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: West McAdams, environmental quality
specialist with the South Carolina Sea Grant Extension Program, is working
with Nancy Schilling of Schilling's Boathouse on Hilton Head Island to
establish a statewide marina association. Current efforts are geared toward
the creation of a network of local associations both on the coast and on
interior lakes. A survey is being sent out in the fall of 1996 to assess
interest in an organization. Currently, only one active local organization
exists in the state. South Carolina Sea Grant Extension wishes to establish
an association for better distribution of information on all aspects of
marina operation, with an emphasis on environmental matters.</P>

<P>A. <A NAME="SC3"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Marina Newsletter</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: South Carolina Sea Grant maintains
a current database of all coastal marinas, and will be publishing and mailing
the first in a series of semiannual newsletters in November. The newsletters
will combine information from the MarinaNet newsletter and from local marina
owners or others such as regulatory agents who wish to write on issues
that are more specific to marinas in South Carolina. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="TX1"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Texas Marina Survey 1986-1995
</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: A survey of public marinas in Texas
was conducted to detect changes over the past 10 years. Many changes were
detected. The survey found that the number of coastal marinas declined
from 125 in 1986 to 96 today. The number of freshwater or inland marinas
rose from 184 to 214. The study showed that marinas are growing in size.
In 1986, 125 coastal marinas contained 13,026 wet slips, an average of
104 per marina. Now, 96, coastal marinas contain 12, 340 slips, an average
of 129 slips per marina. Researchers found that Texas marinas offer more
luxury services today, but fewer basic services than in 1986. Boat rentals
and charters are big business at Texas marinas, with 179 facilities offering
them, up from 120 in 1986. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="TX2"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Clean Vessel Act </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: An in-depth survey of pumpout facilities
in all Texas marinas was carried out to assist in development of a statewide
plan for an education and demonstration program for Clear Lake area boaters
that included Rpotti trainingS for boat operators, a demonstration of pumpout
facilities and free pumpouts. A Potti Training Manual for Boats was published
and includes information on pumpout locations on Clear Lake and U.S. Coast
Guard regulations on the use of marine sanitation devices (MSDs) and the
types of MSDs used on vessels. A section of the manual describes how vessel
sewage discharges impact water quality, public health and the marine environment.
An additional educational project on pumpout use is planned by Massey for
1996-1997 on a statewide basis utilizing Clean Vessel Act funds. </P>

of marinas and boatyards. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="VA2"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Waterfronts </P>

<P>B. BRIEF PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Virginia Sea Grant is assisting rural
waterfront communities with planning for eco-tourism projects such as educational
facilities, boat and walking guide services, permitting, funding facility
and waterfront tourism services, all within an atmosphere of minimal impacts
on living and non-living coastal resources. A current example is preliminary
work with the town of Wachapreague and The Nature Conservancy in an effort
to enhance eco-tourism utilization of the town's waterfront and the extensive
wetlands-barrier island environment adjacent to the town. I also, serve
on the Norfolk Harborfest, Inc. Committee which annually coordinates a
Chesapeake Bay Work Boat Race and Work Boat Parade on the Norfolk-Portsmouth,
Virginia urban waterfront. </P>

<P>A. <A NAME="VA3"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Marine Recreational Fisheries
</P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: I am involved in research on marine
recreational fisheries issues and conducting research-advisory work. Research
projects have included studies of hook-release mortality in coastal fisheries
including summer flounder, tautog (a wreck-artificial reef fish) and bluefin
tuna. Another program is the Virginia Game Fish Tagging Program which is
using trained anglers to tag specific recreationally sought fish for the
purpose of improving fisheries management. Other research concerns include
artificial reefs. </P>

<P><A NAME="VA4"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Monitoring Virginia's artificial
reefs </P>

<P>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: Virginia's artificial reef program,
as with most U.S. Atlantic coastal states, must emphasize reef construction
over research and monitoring as it strives to meet public demand for improved
fishing locations. Reef performance is typically evaluated through anecdotal
information supplied by recreational fishermen and divers. While scientific
divers are occasionally requested to examine sites, no comprehensive monitoring
of state reef sites has occurred. An assessment of management needs for
Atlantic coast reef programs recommended among its top priorities that
states initiate systematic, multiyear monitoring studies to assess reef
fisheries. This two-year study addresses these priorities: (1) to explore
use of a random telephone survey of identified recreational fishermen to
monitor relative fishing performance of artificial reefs in Virginia; and
(2) compare relative fishing performance among reefs and other popular
structure fishing sites in estuarine (Chesapeake Bay) and adjacent offshore
waters.</P>

<P>A. <A NAME="WA1"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Revitalizing Two Small Communities'
Waterfronts--A National Demonstration Project </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: The economies of many small bay
and riverfront communities in coastal Washington and Oregon are reeling
under the impact of timber-related industrial dislocations such as mill
automation, timber supply shortages due to the spotted owl habitat issue,
and high levels of log exports. Without alternative economic activity many
of these communities will continue to stagnate, or decline. The goals of
the project, funded jointly by NCRI and Washington and Oregon Sea Grant
programs, is to demonstrate that the economies of these communities can
be expanded and broadened by revitalizing their urban waterfronts. This
is being accomplished by engaging the cities, the local port authorities,
waterfront businesses and the citizenry of Raymond, Washington, and Warrenton,
Oregon, in developing demonstration waterfront revitalization plans utilizing
the community-based planning process described in Waterfront Revitalization
for Small Cities, authored by two of the Principal Investigators in 1990.
</P>

<P>A third year enhancement project to conduct regional workshops around
the country is in abeyance, pending the results of a NCRI coastal community
development workshop proposed in 1996&quot;. </P>

<P>The project final report, in two volumes, is available from NCRI. Vol.I
describes the project's history and evaluation; vol. two contains the two
communities' waterfront revitalization plans.&quot;</P>

<P>A. <A NAME="WA2"></A>TITLE OF CRT PROGRAM: Columbia River Boater Access
Study </P>

<P>B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRT PROGRAM: During 1995-96 two groups of Pacific
Northwest boaters who use the Columbia River are being surveyed to better
understand how, where and when they use the river, and what are their unmet
needs for access. The first group are motor boaters, the second paddlers
(canoeists and kayakers). The former were intercepted at boat launch ramps
and transient moorage facilities during Memorial Day weekend and again
at mid-week and a following off-peak weekend except for recreational fishermen
near the mouth of the river who were surveyed during the fall salmon seasons.
Paddlers received a mailed survey during January and February 1996. Results
of the motorboat access study, funded in part by the Washington State Interagency
Committee for Outdoor Recreation and in part by Washington Sea grant Program,
will be used at an invitational bi-state workshop in May to make recommendations
for access improvements on the Columbia River between Tri-Cities and the
river mouth. Three similar access studies, funded by the Oregon State Marine
Board, have been conducted on the Oregon shore of the river under the auspices
of Oregon State University Extension/Sea grant will also inform the workshop.

<h1 align=center>National Sea Grant Marina Network:</h1>

<h2 align=center>Enhancing the Economic and Environmental Sustainability
of the Marina Industry.</h2>

<p>The marina industry is rapidly becoming a dominant coastal business.
Many Sea Grant programs are interacting with the marina industry, addressing
critical economic and environmental issues facing marinas, and providing
important information to the industry. However, information exchange among
programs is limited. To make Sea Grant's interaction with this important
industry more productive, the National Sea Grant Marina Network (MarinaNet)
creates a system for the efficient transfer of information and experience
about marina operations. The network will create and reinforce connections
among Sea Grant programs, and between Sea Grant and the marina industry,
regulatory agencies, and other marine-related organizations.</p>

<p>The MarinaNet project began on August 1, 1995 and will be completed
by July 31, 1997. The principal investigators are<a href="masstaff.html#lee">
Virginia Lee</a> and <a href="masstaff.html#amaral">Mark Amaral</a>, from
Rhode Island Sea Grant. Co-investigators include: <a 
href="masstaff.html#wypyszinski">Alex
Wypyszinski</a>, New Jersey; <a href="masstaff.html#liffmann">Michael 
Liffmann</a>,
Louisiana; <a href="masstaff.html#hollin">Dewayne Hollin</a>, Texas; <a 
href="masstaff.html#clarke">Marion
Clarke</a>, Florida; <a href="masstaff.html#schwartz">John Schwartz</a>,
Michigan; and <a href="masstaff.html#deyoung">Bruce DeYoung</a>, Oregon.
Each member of the MarinaNet team is responsible for networking with regulatory
and nonregulatory agencies, other Sea Grant programs, and with the marina
industry within their regions.</p>

<h3>Objectives </h3>

<ul>
<li>Link individual Sea Grant programs with marina-related activities or
projects into a national network to facilitate easy access to all research,
advisory, and outreach activities and make the network available to the
marina industry, Sea Grant programs, and regulatory agencies. </li>

<li>Encourage a proactive and economically sustainable approach to the
aquatic environment by marina personnel and their clients. </li>

<li>Serve as a conduit of research information between academia and the
marine trades to a) facilitate the emergence and application of best management
and marketing practices; and b) respond to the continuing demographic changes
along the nation's coastal margin that are resulting in a public expectation
of a balanced approach toward public access to coastal resources. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Methods </h3>

<ul>
<li>Develop a network of Sea Grant personnel, drawn from state programs,
who are active participants in the marina industry. Key elements include:
</li>

<ol>
<li>establishing a communication network linked with the National Sea Grant
Depository for on-line access to documents; </li>

<li>hosting a preconference meeting for Sea Grant at the 1997 International
Marina Conference; </li>

<li>creation of a national environmental catalog for marinas that distills
existing Sea Grant marina operations information; and </li>

<li>assessment of research opportunities. </li>
</ol>

<li>Provide an efficient point of contact through which national marine
trade associations can interface with Sea Grant. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="progress">Activities</a></h3>
<h4>Summer 1996 Progress Report</h4>

<ul>
<h4>Facilitating Outreach</h4>
<p>
In an effort to transfer information and new technologies among Sea
Grant network staff and marina industry personnel, <a 
href="newslet.html">MarinaNet 
News</a>, a semi-annual newsletter of the MarinaNet program was published and
circulated to Sea Grant communicators, Marine Advisory Service leaders, and
interested marine industry personnel.  The first edition, compiled by Texas
A&M University Sea Grant, covered the establishment of the marina network
and focused on MarinaNet funding and projects related to the Clean Vessel
Act.  Also highlighted was information about the MarinaNet discussion group
and ongoing research projects.  A list of recreational marina publications
was included for reference.  The second edition, to be distributed this
September, will be compiled by Louisiana Sea Grant.
<p>
Low Power Radio (LPR) has been identified by MarinaNet as a response to
declining numbers of staff members available to conduct needed outreach to
coastal residents, tourists, and recreational enterprises.  A pilot
project, developed by MarinaNet, will test the use of 100 milliwatt LPR
units broadcasting on the AM bandwidth in three regions of the country.
These LPR units will be installed on inland waters to provide information
about safety and navigation, local marine events, catch-and-release
programs, locations of pumpout services as well as weather updates and
accident reports.
<p>
Lastly, an Internet-based web page and discussion group to speed
information exchange among marine trades businesses, public agencies,
communities, academics, consultants, and Sea Grant staffs are now online.
Links with marina and coastal tourism sites throughout the United States
are provided by the web page, with marina-related news, questions, and
problems shared in the discussion group.  Interested persons can <a 
href="subscribe.html">subscribe</a> to the discussion group through the home 
page.
<h4>
Distilling Issues and Ideas</h4>
<p>	MarinaNet coordinators have invited a mix of marina industry leaders,
private consultants, academics, government officials, nongovernmental
organizations, and marina business owners and operators to identify future
research needs of the marina industry during a <strong>collegium in March 
1997.</strong>
Facilitator-led focus group sessions will stimulate discussions to develop
research topics that are national in scope.  Topics for the focus groups
include marina marketing issues, industry economic impacts, sustaining
industry and communities, facilities and services, business management
issues, and  recreational boater education.
<h4>
Encouraging Understanding</h4>
<p>	Spring 1995 brought together two Sea Grant programs involved in 
MarinaNet
with the Marine Environmental Education Foundation (MEEF) to conduct a
three-day training program, "Managing Marinas: Merging Economics and
Environment" for those who create and enforce state policies that affect
marinas in several Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states.  The training program
consisted of seminars, projects, field trips, discussions, role playing,
and informal interactions.  Following the intensive program, the
participants from Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New
York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland were able to describe profitable
and environmentally responsible methods of operating and managing marinas,
list typical marina services and profit centers for marinas, understand the
effect of current nonpoint source pollution regulatory activities on marina
profits, and identify possible modifications for state coastal management
and regulation programs pertaining to marinas.
<p>	Response to the workshop was quite positive.  Several 
participants noted
that the workshop had changed their perceptions of the marine trades
industry.  Similar workshops are planned for other locations.
</ul>

<p>Further progress reports will be posted on this site periodically.</p>

<h1>MarinaNet Email Discussion List</h1>

<p>As part of this project, Oregon Sea Grant is hosting an electronic mail-based
discussion group to enhance communication and information sharing among
marina interests, including businesses, public agencies, communities, academics,
consultants and Sea Grant staff. </p>

<p>The group is open to anyone who wants to exchange marina-related news,
questions, problems and dialogue. Such exchanges, it is hoped, will help
create a virtual community of shared interests across time and distance.
</p>

<p>Among those who might benefit from the forum are: </p>

<ul>
<li>For-profit marine trades businesses</li>

<li>Non-profit marine trades related enterprises</li>

<li>Government policy makers and their staff</li>

<li>University faculty and Sea Grant staff</li>

<li>Interested citizens</li>

<li>Consultants</li>

<li>Lobbyists</li>

<li>University and college students</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these groups has different perspectives and different styles
of doing work, but they share a common interest in the environmental, social,
and economic aspects of marinas. </p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You had no choice about the name your parents selected for you. But
those who chose your name had reasons for their selection, including some
anticipation of your future. MarinaNet is the name given to a nationwide
Sea Grant effort to transfer information and experience about marina operations
efficiently among academia, the marina industry, regulatory agencies and
other marine-related organizations. The Sea Grant regional representatives
who gave the loose organization this name anticipated that the marine environment's
future would be related to the efforts of all who work and play in it.
Because these representatives realize that idea exchange and dialogue can
help all marine-related organizations grow and prosper in this type of
environment, they plan to produce several communications products. MarinaNet
News is the first.</P>

<P>The News is the Sea Grant family's internal document - a biannual newsletter
edited and produced by four Sea Grant programs on a rotating basis - to
disseminate information about marine-related projects and issues for all
to use. It provides ideas. This publication is for you. To maximize its
value, you need to summarize and submit information about marine-related
events or programs in your area so that all of us, your MarinaNet partners,
may learn from your success or duplicate your procedures. This one's for
you.</P>

<H2><A NAME="marina network"></A>Sea Grant programs establish marina network</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A national network for marinas and marine-related trades has been established
through selected Sea Grant Programs. Led by Rhode Island Sea Grant, this
network is designed to make Sea Grant's interaction with the marina industry
more productive. The National Sea Grant Marina Network (MarinaNet) creates
a system to transfer information and experience about marina operations
efficiently among academia, the marina industry, regulatory agencies and
other marine-related organizations.</P>

<P>Begun in August 1995, the two-year MarinaNet project expands an existing
informal network of Sea Grant researchers and outreach staff who work with
marina operators. It links university-based departments across the country,
regulatory agencies and marine-related organizations with marinas to share
technical advice, management ideas and information on regulations.</P>

<P>MarinaNet's immediate goals are to:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Link individual Sea Grant programs with marine-related activities or
projects into a national network to facilitate easy access to research,
advisory and outreach activities and to make the network available to the
marina industry, Sea Grant programs and regulatory agencies.</LI>

<LI>Encourage a proactive and economically sustainable approach to the
aquatic environment by marina personnel and their clients</LI>

<LI>. Serve as a conduit of research information between academia and the
marine trades to encourage the emergency and application of best management
and marketing practices, and to respond to the continuing demographic changes
along the nation's coastline in a way that balances public and private
access to coastal resources.</LI>
</UL>

<P>MarinaNet will establish an on-line communications network within the
next two years, conduct a joint Sea Grant-industry conference, identify
marina-related research needs and publish a national inventory of relevant
marina activities and research.</P>

<P>The MarinaNet partners are in the process of contacting personnel in
other Sea Grant Programs to confirm their interest in participating in
the network through an on-line system of homepages, databases and bibliographies
focusing on marine trades. Five additional specific activities are planned
for the next 18 months.</P>

<P>This newsletter is the first of four that will be distributed biannually
to convey information about marine-related projects and issues for use
by all Sea Grant Programs. Subscribers are encouraged to submit information
about events or programs, and to reproduce materials from MarinaNet News
in local publications.</P>

<P>The MarinaNet partners will distribute industry publications through
the Internet, raise marina industry awareness of how new technologies can
improve business practices, and asses strategies for involving more business
faculty in future marina industry outreach and research projects.</P>

<P>An information catalog highlighting marina-related Sea Grant activities
will be developed and linked to existing on-line bibliographies. Wherever
possible, this index will be linked to the actual documents as they become
available on-line.</P>

<P>Sea Grant will host a preconference at the 1997 International Marina
Institute Conference to assess industry's needs for future research (see
accompanying article on the research collegium). Finally, the partners
will continue to work with the major marina associations (National Marina
Manufacturer's Association, Boat/US, American Boat Builders and Repairers
Association, National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration, Coastal Programs
Division and state associations) and agencies (Environmental Protection
Agency and their counterparts on the state level) to ensure they are aware
of, and using where possible, the Sea Grant network.</P>

<H2><A NAME="meeting"></A>Sea Grant meeting to identify future research
needs</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As part of the MarinaNet project, Sea Grant is proposing to convene
a meeting of knowledgeable people from across the nation to identify future
research needs of the marina industry. A mix of marina industry leaders,
private consultants, academics, government officials, non-governmental
organizations and marine business owners and operators will be invited
to participate in the collegium, tentatively in early 1997.</P>

<P>A collegium uses structured focus group sessions to stimulate discussions
resulting in the formulation of research topics. The sessions are focused
by a facilitator, who asks specific questions to be explored. The questions
will be provided to delegates prior to the collegium so that they can prepare.</P>

<P>&quot;Prior preparation provides the basis for rich discussions, and
the introduction of ideas and implications that are not always immediately
obvious,&quot; said Bruce DeYoung of Oregon Sea Grant. &quot;The thinking
that is associated with preparation often leads to an integration of ideas
and topics as well.&quot;</P>

<P>The research committee of MarinaNet, made up of Marine Advisory Service
personnel from the Oregon, Michigan, Louisiana, Texas and Rhode Island
Sea Grant Programs, selected this format as a method to achieve MarinaNet's
objective of promoting marina industry-related research that is national
in scope. The topics around which the focus groups will work include marina
marketing issues, quantifying industry economic impacts, sustaining industry
and communities, technology of facilities and services, business management
issues, and educational issues of recreational boaters.</P>

<P>&quot;Assistance will be sought through the major marine industry associations,&quot;
explained Mark Amaral, a MarinaNet principal investigator, &quot;and the
collegium will probably be convened in conjunction with a major marina
research conference.&quot;</P>

<P>For more information about the collegium, contact <A HREF="http://seagrant.orst.edu/crt/masstaff.html#amaral">Mark

<H3>Sea Grant and the Clean Vessel Act</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Clean Vessel Act (CVA) provides funds to the states on a competitive
basis for the construction and/or renovation, operation and maintenance
of pumpout and portable toilet dump stations. Several Sea Grant programs
have contributed to the success of CVA projects. Here are but a few:</P>

<P><B>Louisiana</B> Sea Grant and the Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service
have produced a series of marina bulletin boards designed to encourage
awareness of the marine environment. Several marinas located on Lake Pontchartrain,
each installed a bulletin board in a &quot;high-traffic&quot; area and
Sea Grant provided educational materials. The goal of the project was to
encourage pumpout use. A Sea Grant brochure explained the different types
of marine sanitation devices (MSDs), Coast Guard regulations concerning
them, and encouraged pumpout out type III MSDs at a marina. The bulletin
boards concentrated on encouraging recreational boaters to use the pumpout
stations. Using the theme &quot;You're the Solution to Pollution&quot;
and underwater photos to emphasize the marine environment, the bulletin
boards demonstrate that effluent can spoil this playground for plants,
animals and humans. Placards on the bulletin boards describe proper use
of the pumpout, and the effects effluent can have on the accompanying pictures.</P>

<P><B>Texas</B> Sea Grant has been involved in Clean Vessel Act activities
from working on statewide surveys of marina pumpout facilities; conducting
an action demonstration program to educate boaters on the value of using
pumpout stations; assisting in the development of a statewide plan for
construction and renovation of marina pumpout facilities; and producing
educational materials on requirements for handling vessel sewage waste
and use of marine sanitation devices. MAS business management specialist
Dewayne Hollin used a Texas Parks and Wildlife Department grant to conducted
an in-depth survey of pumpout facilities in all Texas marinas to assist
in development of a statewide plan for construction of new pumpout stations
and dump stations. Julie Massey, MAS Galveston County marine agent, conducted
an education and demonstration program for Clear Lake area boaters that
included &quot;potti training&quot; for boat operators, a demonstration
of pumpout facilities and free pumpouts. The Potti Training Manual for
Boats includes information on pumpout locations on Clear Lake and U.S.
Coast Guard regulations on the use of marine sanitation devices (MSDs)
and the types of MSDs used on vessels. A section of the manual describes
how vessel sewage discharges impact water quality, public health and the
marine environment. An additional educational project on pumpout use is
planned by Massey for 1996-1997 on a statewide basis utilizing Clean Vessel
Act funds and MAS personnel.</P>

<P><B>New York</B> has worked with several state agencies to conduct a
teleconference focusing on boat waste; developed a series of public service
announcements on the CVA and New York organizations participating; developed
a poster for retail outlets and boat shows, and are continuing to develop
promotional materials in the use of pumpout facilities.</P>

<P><B>Oregon Sea Grant</B> and Oregon State Marine Board are jointly funding
and producing a booklet for recreational boaters on appropriate practices
to limit their environmental impact. Issues related to CVA projects will
be addresses as part of this publication.</P>

<P><B>Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Sea Grant</B> program has
worked with the Massachusetts CZM program to address the boater education
issue by sharing a joint exhibit at boat shows and distributing information
on pumpout facilities and pumpout information.</P>

<P><B>California Sea Grant</B> has worked on a number of nonpoint source
pollution program areas, including CVA activities. These include conducting
surveys, conducting forums on implementing voluntary and enforcement programs
for boating pollution prevention; providing environmental information for
marinas and recreational boating and publishing numerous materials on pollution
prevention, including a marina Pollution Prevention Manual.</P>

<P>These are only a few of the many environmental education projects and
programs carried out by Sea Grant on behalf of the marina industry and
recreational boating. We would like to hear from you about other Sea Grant
activities in this area. Send your information to: marina-mg@seagrant.orst.edu.</P>

<HR width="100%"></P>

<H2><A NAME="cva1"></A>What the Clean Vessel Act does</H2>

<P>Congress passed the Clean Vessel Act in 1992 to help reduce pollution
from vessel sewage discharges. The Act provides for a five-year federal
grant program administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and authorizes
$40 million from the Sport Fish and Restoration Account of the Aquatic
Resources Trust Fund for use by the States. Federal funds constitute 75
percent of all approved projects.</P>

<P>Grants are available to the States on a competitive basis for the construction
and/or renovation, operation and maintenance of pumpout and portable toilet
dump stations.</P>

<P>The Fish and Wildlife Service Division of Federal Aid convenes a ranking
panel of Federal employees including representatives from the Service's
Washington Office of the Division of Federal Aid, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA), the Environmental Protection Agency
and the U.S. Coast Guard. The panel reviews, ranks and makes funding recommendations
to the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service.</P>

<P>States submit grant proposals to one of seven regional offices for review
and submission to the ranking panel for consideration.</P>

<P>All recreational vessels must have access to pumpouts funded under the
Clean Vessel Act. NOAA will create nautical charts detailing the location
of all pumpout and dump stations. Halfway through the program, grants have
been awarded to install 1,200 pumpout stations and 630 dump stations. A
maximum fee of $5 may be charged for use of pumpout facilities constructed
or maintained with grant funds.</P>

<P>After a public comment period, the Federal agencies, in cooperation
with private organizations and the marine community, developed a pumpout
symbol and a national slogan. Both will appear on products funded by the
Clean Vessel Act.</P>

<H2><A NAME="dump?"></A>What happens when you dump?</H2>

<UL>
<LI>The untreated discharge from one weekend boater deposits the same amount
of bacterial pollution into the water as does the treated sewage of 10,000
people (San Francisco Bay Estuary Project)</LI>

<LI>Raw or poorly treated sewage can spread disease, contaminate shellfish
beds and lower oxygen levels in water. Waterborne diseases include hepatitis,
typhoid and cholera, which can be transmitted by shellfish. Since sewage
uses oxygen to decompose, oxygen levels in polluted waters decrease and
deprive fish and other aquatic species of dissolved oxygen. The result
can be stagnant water and fish kills.</LI>

<LI>Shellfish are filter feeders that eat tiny food particles pumped through
their gills into their stomachs, along with bacteria from sewage. Shellfish
can convey nearly all waterborne pathogens to humans.</LI>

<LI>Sewage is measured in terms of fecal coliforms, which are bacteria
produced in the intestines of all warm-blooded animals. Test results are
expressed as the number of bacteria per 100 milliliters (ml) of water.
Shellfish beds are closed when the coliform count reaches 14 per 100 ml
of water. Public beaches are closed to swimmers when the coliform count
reaches 200 per 100 ml of water.</LI>

<LI>In January 1995 the Journal of the American Medical Association reported
that an outbreak of viral gastroenteritis in Florida, Georgia and Texas,
resulting from the consumption of oysters, was traceable to marine sewage
disposal on or near oyster harvesting areas in Apalachicola and Galveston
Bays. In February 1995 the magazine concluded that the outbreak resulted
from the disposal of sewage of one or more ill harvesters that contaminated
the oysters in the oyster bed.</LI>

<LI>Areas most likely to be affected are sheltered waters with low flushing
rates, waters with significant recreational value, areas designated for
shellfish harvesting, state and federally designated significant habitats
such as those designated in coastal zone programs, and waters designated

<H2><A NAME="Educate"></A>What We Are Doing To Educate Boaters</H2>

<UL>
<LI>The Clean Vessel Act (CVA) appropriates a portion of its total funding
to advance the topic of boater sewage, its effects and the means by which
boaters can avoid improper sewage disposal.</LI>

<LI>The first goal is to make boaters aware of the importance of proper
sewage disposal. The awareness campaign kicked off in February at the Miami
Boat Show, which featured a guest speaker on boater sewage and other speakers
on environmental boater issues. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released
its awareness campaign products, including the pumpout symbol, slogan and
brochure, announced the pumpout grant awards. The Act provides $10 million
for 1996 grants.</LI>

<LI>The kickoff included representatives from the Fish and Wildlife Service,
Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
U.S. Coast Guard, Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the
National Marine Manufacturers Association. These agencies and organizations
intend to coordinate with marine interests to distribute materials and
educate boaters on the use of pumpout and dump stations. Other agencies
are welcome to join in this partnership.</LI>

<LI>The second goal focuses on the education of boaters. The intent is
to inform people of sewage disposal problems, educate them on the use and
advantage of using pumpout and dump stations, and onwhere to locate pumpout
and dump stations.</LI>

<LI>Currently, vessels use four types of sewage disposal systems. Many
boaters use portable toilets that can be drained at dump stations. Vessels
more than 26 feet in length, however, typically have Marine Sanitation
Devices (MSD). MSDs are available in three forms, all of which can hold
waste for disposal at a pumpout station.</LI>

<LI>Major CVA educational products include a poster, press and training
packets, educational folders, and a connection to the 1-800-ASK-FISH telephone
service line that handles questions and concerns regarding pumpout locations
and site-trouble reporting.</LI>

<H2><A NAME="Texas"></A>Texas directory shows 10-year increase in inland
marinas</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Although Texas has experienced relatively no growth in the number of
public marinas over the past 10 years, a recent survey shows a shift in
the location of the marinas.</P>

<P>Researchers with the Texas Marine Advisory Service here, who conducted
a survey of 310 marinas, said that the number of coastal marinas declined
from 125 in 1986 to 96 today. The number of freshwater or inland marinas
rose from 184 to 214. The Texas Marine Advisory Service (MAS) is operated
by the Sea Grant program at Texas A&amp;M University.</P>

<P>Dewayne Hollin, a MAS business specialist, said the increase in inland
marinas may be attributed to a surge in lake development and more waterfront
development near these lakes. The decrease in the number of coastal marinas
can be linked to privatizing of commercial development, Hollin said.</P>

<P>&quot;Some coastal marinas were closed to the general public when condominiums
were constructed as part of the project, and the storage facilities became
private. Others just went out of business,&quot; Hollin said.</P>

<P>The study showed that marinas are growing in size. In 1986, 125 coastal
marinas contained 13,026 wet slips, an average of 104 per marina. Now,
96 coastal marinas contain 12,340 slips, an average of 129 slips per marina.</P>

<P>In 1986, the 184 inland marinas contained 22,449 wet slips, an average
of 122 per facility. Today, 214 inland marinas contain 27,419 wet slips,
an average of 128 per facility. The study showed that Texas contains 39,759
public wet slips, and increase of more than 4,000 since 1986.</P>

<P>Statewide there is nearly twice as much boat storage capacity in the
Clear Lake/Galveston Bay area than in any other area. The bay area contains
33 marinas, providing a total of 7,910 wet slips and 1,430 dry storage
spaces. Clear Lake has 21 marinas, accounting for 6,058 wet slips and 632
dry storage slots.</P>

<P>Researchers found that Texas' marinas offer more luxury services today,
but fewer basic services than in 1986. Ninety-seven marinas offer haul
out services, down from 109 in 1986. Today 93 marinas offer retail sales
of boats, motors or other equipment, down from 107 in 1986. Repair service
of boats, engines and hulls is provided at 105 marinas, down from 116.
Pumpout service, rarely provided in 1986, is offered at 93 facilities today.</P>

<P>Boat rentals and charters are big business at Texas marinas, with 179
facilities offering them, up from 120 in 1986. The study also showed increases
in the number of marinas that sell food or groceries and offer lodging.</P>

<P>A Maryland Sea Grant Extension publication Recreational Boating in Maryland
- An Economic Impact Study recently reported the results of an extensive
survey and analysis done in 1994. The study queried a sample of 1,159 owners
of Maryland-registered boats, which were representative of the 190,436
boats registered in that state.</P>

<P>One segment of the report stated that the average annual boat-related
expenditure for each registered boat was:</P>

<P>The other reported categories, in which powerboaters outspent sailboaters
were: Engine - new ($67 to $51); Engine - maintenance and repair ($274
to $177). [Note that the boat-related expenditures in the above table are
averages across all boaters in the category regardless of whether they
had any expenditure. For example: New engines cost far more than $67 to
$51, which means that for every respondent who purchased a new engine there
were many others who did not.]</P>

<P>The study also reported annual trip-related expenditures by boaters,
and here the in-water powerboats, as might be expected due to fuel cost,
out-paced the sailboaters $1,192 to $720. In addition to spending less
money on fuel and fishing supplies than powerboaters, the sailors lived
up to their reputation by also spending less money on food and lodging
($554 to $685). The trailered powerboaters spent more on trips than the
other two categories of boaters - $1,283 with fishing supplies and transportation
(trailering costs) accounting for the bulk of the difference.</P>

<P>Also noteworthy in the report (in addition to the detailed reports of
dollar-value of economic impact) was the conclusion that every 10.5 registered
or documented boats in Maryland were shown to be equivalent to one full-time
job; and that the Total Annual Spending (trip plus boat-related expenses
plus new and used boat purchases) by each boater averaged $5,311. Researchers
placed an additional economic output value of $5,136 for the average $5,311
spent for each boat registered in Maryland.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Transient"></A>Transient boaters affect U.P. coastal communities</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Every summer, hundreds of transient boaters flock from their home ports
to Michigan's Upper Peninsula marinas where they stay overnight.</P>

<P>In the past, many coastal communities seemed neither to understand nor
even really care about who makes up this group of boaters, where they come
from or what roles they play in local economies.</P>

<P>Today, however, several communities are taking a more serious look at
the transient boaters who visit their ports. The change in attitude has
developed in response to several studies by the Michigan Sea Grant College
Program, the most recent completed in 1994.</P>

<P>The reports show that recreational boating brings a great deal of money
into port communities of the Upper Peninsula, and that transient boaters
tend to spend more than other tourists.</P>

<P>The research began in 1988, when Tony Schomin, director of the Department
of Recreation in Escanaba, requested assistance from Ron Kinnunen, the
Upper Peninsula Sea Grant marine advisory agent, in assessing the needs
of this specialized group of boaters.</P>

<P>&quot;We wanted to determine how these boaters found out about Escanaba,&quot;
Schomin said. &quot;And we wanted to monitor economic impact and boater
satisfaction.&quot;</P>

<P>Sea Grant arranged for researchers Susan I. Stewart and Daniel J. Stynes
of the Michigan State University Department of Park and Recreation Resources
to survey transient boaters in Gladstone and Fayette State Parks, as well
as Escanaba.</P>

<P>Additional surveys of nine more communities throughout the state and
a follow-up report on Escanaba were conducted in 1989 and 1992.</P>

<P>In 1992 - which was a slow season for boaters, according to Kinnunen
- Ontonagon, Marquette, Hancock and Escanaba took in a combined total of
$187,9111 from transient boaters. The two Upper Pennisula sites examined
in 1989 - Sault Ste. Marie and De Tour - took in $864,911 from this group
of tourists alone.</P>

<P>These studies document the significant impact that transient boaters
have on the ports they visit, Kinnunen says. They outline travel patterns,
common sources of information, average party sizes, average ages of skippers
and crew members, amount of money spent by transient boaters at marinas
and in nearby communities, and more. It was found that just over half the
money spent by transient boaters ends up in the local community and the
remaining amount is retained at the marina itself.</P>

<P>A number of participating communities have considered this information
when creating waterfront development and revitalization plans, Kinnunen
reports.</P>

<P>For example, the Downtown Development Authority in Marquette used information
from the most recent study to support a $2.6 million development project,
which included the construction of a new marina.</P>

<P>These reports help predict the behavior of transient boaters in the
Upper Peninsula and aid in developing strategies to attract more boaters
to particular areas by meeting their needs, Kinnunen said.</P>

<P>Michigan Sea Grant researchers concluded that transient boaters must
be viewed both as boaters and as tourists to be satisfied.</P>

<P>As boaters, they are concerned with the physical aspects of the marina.
These include safety and security of their crafts, as well as the availability
of services such as dockage, fuel, utilities and supplies.</P>

<P>As tourists, transient boaters are interested in local transportation,
recreation and access to information about areas where they stay.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Dockside"></A>Dockside boater contact great educational tool</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The unofficial experiences of some Sea Grant students this past summer
suggest that dockside contact with recreational boaters might be a versatile
educational tool. Two graduate students from Louisiana State University
and Northwestern State University were conducting a survey of anglers at
a huge freshwater reservoir on the Texas-Louisiana border, Toledo Bend,
to try to define the typical movement of recreational boats to the reservoir
from other freshwater areas. The students' purpose was to slow the spread
of zebra mussels in the state. Since Toledo Bend covers about 187,000 acres,
the students worked at different areas of the lake and in different marinas
each weekend of the summer boating/fishing season. Based on an earlier
zebra mussel survey project developed by Connecticut Sea Grant, this project
was part of some zebra mussel outreach and research conducted by Louisiana
Sea Grant.</P>

<P>By mid-July, the two researchers had interviewed almost 400 recreational
boaters, primarily anglers. As the summer progressed, the students reported
an increase in the awareness among the sportsmen of zebra mussels, an increasing
interest in learning more about the animals and a willingness to take a
few steps to prevent their spread. The two research students found that
the informal atmosphere of conducting a survey dockside opened the door
to opportunities for exchanging information on many subjects. The survey/study
actually presented an opportunity to educate the boaters and anglers on
topics relative to their aquatic recreational area.</P>

<P>This experience suggests that Sea Grant and Cooperative Extension Service
personnel might be able to extend the outreach arm usually projected through
brochures, posters, and bulletin boards by using a similar approach. For
example, while helping a marina determine what types of waste are being
generated onboard boats regularly using a facility, a surveyor could educate
the captain and his crew about waste management through waste reduction,
or even increase awareness of the actual volume of certain little bits
of litter, like cigarette butts, that enter their favorite lake or river.</P>

<h3>Fishing Families, Businesses, Communities and Regions</h3>

<p>Much attention has been given to the environmental and regulatory
aspects of America's fisheries. Less is known about the human side: the
people who catch and process fish, the communities and regions where they
live, and how they respond and adapt to change. 

<p>A centerpiece of Oregon Sea Grant's 1995-97 research program is an
unusual, multidisciplinary project which combines the efforts of seven
research and outreach teams to take a systematic, comprehensive look at
fishing families, their businesses and communities and the regions where
they live. 

<p>At the heart of the project is a desire to understand how fishing
people and communities adapt to the change which is a constant in their
industry. 

<p>The project will work in two directions. While researchers seek to
learn more about the industry and its people, an outreach team of
Extension Sea Grant agents and specialists will work with people in
Oregon's fishing communities to develop and deliver information that can
help them better understand and deal with the effects of change.

<h2>Biotechnology</h2>
<p>Oregon State University has long been known for its pioneering
biotechnological approaches to fish disease. Since the early 1980s, OSU
has nurtured an outstanding cadre of biotechnologists working with
marine plant life. Together, they contribute to our understanding of the
complex chemical world of undersea life, revealing how plants and
animals react with their environment and suggesting new benefits for
humankind.
<p>
For this funding cycle, three talented and productive researchers - William 
Gerwick, Russel Meints and Steven Gould - have joined forces in a special 
effort to explore additional ways in which biotechnology might generate new 
products for human medicine, agriculture and other fields. They are joined in
 their efforts by collaborators from Cornell University, the University of
 California at San Diego, the University of California at Santa Barbara, 
the University of Alberta, Canada and the University of Nebraska, as well 
as researchers working in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.

<p>Meints will characterize the biology of a model brown algal/virus 
system; ultimately, he plans to use that information to genetically 
engineer marine algae. The researcher hopes to develop not only algae 
capable of producing potential medicinal substances, but also other strains 
which could be used for such purposes as waste-water treatment.

<p>Gerwick, long one of Sea Grant's leading researchers in marine 
biotechnology, will build on his past research showing marine algae to 
be a rich source of unique natural products known as "bioactives." In 
collaboration with other researchers and institutions, Gerwick now plans 
to continue investigating the properties and potential uses of these 
exciting natural substances.

<p>Gould's work focuses on ways to increase production of Cyclomarin A, a 
compound, produced by marine bacteria, which shows promise as an 
anti-inflammatory agent. Gould will manipulate the metabolism of the 
bacteria in question in an effort to stimulate greater production of the 
compound. He will also work to clone the bacterial genes that create the 
substance.

<p>Three additional projects, launched in 1994 as part of a national Sea

<p>Red macroalgae are rich sources of compounds which show great promise 
for use in human medicine. Unfortunately, the compounds exist in such tiny quantities that harvesting them from the natural marine environment is difficult. This project seeks to refine
 and expand on the research team's previous work in developing ways to grow the cells in large quantities in a laboratory environment, where they could be easily harvested for research and possible pharmaceutical production.

<p>Curacin A, a chemical substance produced by certain types of marine 
algae, has shown promise for uses as wide as cancer treatment and agricultural pesticide production. In a project launched in 1994, Gerwick is developing different strains of the Curacin 
A-producing organism in an effort to increase production of this and other marine drug analogs.

vaccines against fish viruses is a major constraint on the aquaculture
industry world-wide. Leong, who has pioneered the development of
recombinant-DNA vaccines for fish disease, is attempting to clone
fragments of DNA from infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) onto
the relatively benign bacterium <em>Caulobacter crescentus</em>. The 
bacteria could
then be used to "innoculate" fish exposed to it against the deadly IHNV.
If successful, the new immunization system is expected to be effective,
fast, and cheap, and to cause mimimal stress to the fish.

<p>Fishery models generally relate total adult fish biomass to
reproductive capacity. Those models do not take into account the age
structure of the spawning population, even though it is known that in
some species larger, older fish produce more eggs per pound than
younger, smaller fish. Berkeley and Markle will try to determine how age
truncation (the selective removel of larger fish) affects the
reproductive potential of black rockfish populations. Their work on this
basic assumption of fishery models will have application in the
management of many other species.

<h4><a name="linkedfisheries">The impact of access limitations on a system

<p><strong>Principal investigator:</strong>
<p><a href="../extension/marineecon.html">Susan Hanna</a>
<p>In the early days, anyone who could afford a boat and gear could
enter a commercial fishery. As seasons and conditions changed, fishers
could shift their catch from one species to another. These and other
factors tended to link certain fisheries together. But in recent years,
as some stocks have declined and the fishing power of vessels
increased, limits have been placed on the number of individuals or boats
that get access to a particular fishery. Because fisheries are linked,
limiting access to one can affect another - but this important aspect of
access regulation has never been thoroughly examined. Hanna proposes to
study the effect of access limitation on Pacific groundfish, crab and
pink shrimp fisheries. Her work should increase understanding of similar
linked fisheries in other regions as well.

<p>Efforts to supplement declining wild salmon stocks with hatchery-
reared fish have been hampered in the Northwest by questions about
whether the hatchery stocks are crowding out wild stocks. A key
problem is the difficulty commercial and sport fishers have in telling
the hatchery-raised fish from their threatened or endangered wild
cousins. Efforts to tag the hatchery fish for easy identification have
been hindered by the difficulty of marking large numbers of fish quickly
and cost-effectively. The Pacific Fishery Management Council has listed
development of better fish-marking techniques as a high research
priority. DeFreez and his colleages will develop and evaluate the use of
laser depigmentation as a mass-marking technique. If successful, their
work could make a significant contribution to fishery management.

<p>Fisheries managers need the answer to one question above all: How many 
fish are out there? Stock assessments seek to find that answer, but they 
are invariably subject to errors. Sampson proposes to evaluate the 
accuracy and value of groundfish stock assessments. He will develop 
objective measures of the relative value of different types of stock 
assessment data, so managers can make informed decisions about which data 
to use and which data collection and processing techniques need improvement.

<h2>Fish and Shellfish Health and Disease Control</h2>
<p>Since the earliest years of Oregon Sea Grant, the study of fish and 
shellfish
health and disease control has been a strength of the program, thanks
largely to the leadership of John Fryer. He drew together a team of
fishery microbiologists, parasitologists and virologists who together
have added greatly to our basic knowledge of fish disease and provided
essential support to the nation's hatchery system and its burgeoning
aquaculture industry.

<p>The protozoan parasite <em>Ceratomyxa shasta</em> causes a very
serious disease in salmon, one with no effective control. Only by avoiding
the pathogen can fish escape the disease. But since the parasite's life
cycle is a mystery, even avoidance is problematic. Fryer and
Bartholomew propose to use DNA probes to examine this deadly parasite
and trace its life cycle. Their work would allow hatchery managers and
others to develop strategies for controlling the spread of the disease -
and possibly for interrupting a vulnerable stage in its life cycle.

<p>Although fish disease vaccines - many of them developed 
with Oregon Sea Grant support - have been available since the 1970s,
their effectiveness is limited by the fact that they do not last long,
and are not available at all for many pathogens. Because vaccine
development and approval is a long and costly process, researchers like Jo-Ann Leong
have turned their attention toward the natural disease-fighting
mechanisms of fish. Leong continues her internationally recognized work
with this project, an extension of efforts to explore interleukin, already being tested as an immune system stimulant in mammals, as a
potential fish vaccine.

<h2>Seafood</h2>
<p>Seafood product development has a long tradition in Oregon,
beginning with Columbia River salmon canneries and evolving to the potential use of
genetic engineering to improve seafood stocks. 
<p>Oregon Sea Grant has helped the industry identify
solutions to processing and marketing problems since its beginning. Much
of that work has been done at Oregon State University's Seafood
Laboratory in Astoria, which is poised for expansion with the
construction of a new facility and hiring of new staff.
<p>Oregon's fishing industry focused for many years on salmon,
bottomfish, crab and shrimp. As competition increased and some stocks
declined, Sea Grant has helped the industry identify new fisheries and
seafood products. Among our top success stories: The encouragement of
Oregon's whiting fishery and surimi processing industry, 
thanks to Sea Grant research which helped solve softening and texture problems with
the plentiful groundfish.

<p>Although the Pacific Northwest surimi industry has made great
technological strides, it remains relatively unsophisticated from a
marketing perspective. Sylvia plans to apply dynamic portfolio analysis
to whiting products. The researcher predicts that processors could
increase their economic opportunities and reduce their risks by producing
a wider variety of products, and by varying the quantity of each product in
their portfolios as conditions dictate. Similar analysis has been
applied successfully to agricultural products; this, its first
application to seafood production, could serve as a model for other U.S.
fisheries.

<p>Albacore tuna are being promoted as an alternative to salmon in the
Pacific Northwest, and many former salmon fishermen are interested in
joining that fishery. But albacore belong to the family Scombroidae, and
can be a source of what is known as scombroid poisoning - actually a
reaction to histamine produced by bacteria associated with the fish. New
FDA-based seafood quality guidelines have set stringent limits on histamine
levesls in albacore. Haejung An and her colleagues propose to continue
research that should lead to strategies for controlling histamine levels
in albacore. The work will compare onboard handling techniques and
define microbial, chemical and processing parameters that influence
histaine formation.

<p>Kolbe and Park are among several Sea Grant researchers who for
several years have been exploring "the softening problem" in whiting -
the action of a protease enzyme that softens whiting flesh after
harvest, making it difficult to catch and process the fish fast enough
to produce a high-quality product. They continue their work by looking
at a new processing technique, ohmic heating, which shows promise for
inactivating proteases without the need for potentially undesirable food
additives.

<body BGCOLOR="#00FFFF"><h1>Oregon Sea Grant Research</h1>
<img src="../graphics/bluemarb.gif" alt="------------------">
<h2>Coastal Natural Hazards</h2>
<p>Perceptions of natural hazards along the west coast have changed
markedly in recent years. Severe winter storms and their effects once
dominated the agenda; today, the potential for offshore earthhquakes and
locally generated tsunamis is of much greater concern to coastal
residents and planners. In the Pacific Northwest scientists have
documented a variety of geologic and other evidence that suggests that
the 875-mile long <a href="http://pandora.oce.orst.edu/README.html">Cascadia subduction zone </a>is seismically active and
poses a significant threat to coastal population centers.
<p>Oregon Sea Grant has played an important role in altering perceptions
about the nature and extent of coastal hazards affecting the region.
Recent communications and outreach activities, including regional
conferences, workshops and publications, have fostered increased public
awareness of seismic hazards, helped reshape public policy and focused
attention on preparedness.

<h3>Research Project</h3>

<a href="mailto:dickens@ccmail.orst.edu">Email: dickens@ccmail.orst.edu</a></address>
<p>Waterfront retaining structures in wharfs and quays are widespread in
coastal ports worldwide. But the combination of poor foundation soils
and construction practices can contribute to the vulunerability of these
structures to earthquake damage. Dickenson will work to:
<Ul><li>Identify vulnerable components of retaining walls</li>
<li>Determine the threshold at which excess pore pressures in the
foundation soils result in excessive deformation of retaining
structures</li>
<li>Formulate empirical relations for assessing the damage potential to
existing retaining walls</li>
<li>Develop design guidelines</li></ul>
<p>The project will involve numerical modeling as well as examination of
case studies, including the catastrophic 1995 earthqake in <A Href="http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/QUAKES/HOT/hot.html">Kobe, Japan</a>.
<p>Use of a technical advisory panel and close links with <A
href="../extension/coastal.html">Extension Sea Grant outreach staff</a>
will assure that the results of this work are made available to
potential users.

<h2>Ocean and Coastal Law, Policy and Management</h2>
<p>Most Oregon Sea Grant research projects have public policy
components, whether they focus on water-recycling technology for seafood
processing plants or fisheries management strategies. Once the
technological answers are clear, policy choices must be made.
Implementing new solutions often presents new challenges to our legal,
economic, social and cultural institutions.
<p>Oregon Sea Grant has funded several productive research endeavors in
fisheries and ocean policy. The emphasis of this research area is
changing with the times, as the state's fishing economy is affected by
population growth, habitat loss, resource depletion and changing public
attitudes.

<p>Hildreth will investigate the legal framework relevant to
recovery of weak coastal coho stocks and their habitat - critical and
complex legal questions which face policy makers and manager struggling
to formulate recovery plans for Northwest salmon runs.
<p>Jacobson will assess the implications of U.S. accession to the 1982

<p>Oregon Sea Grant's fisheries engineering work has provided major 
support for a 
new industry for the Oregon coast: The use of whiting, an abundant but 
underutilized Pacific groundfish, in the manufacture of surimi, the 
material from which popular crab- and lobster-flavored seafood analogs 
are made.</P>
<p>Specialist Ed Kolbe's work in bioresource engineering has helped 
conquer texture and softening problems which long made Pacific whiting 
unsuitable for the exacting standards of the surimi industry. Kolbe has 
also worked with Albacore tuna fishers and processors to develop better at-sea 
refrigeration procedures that make for a safer, higher-value  
consumer seafood product. </P>

<P>An Oregon State University whale expert is taking part in an unprecedented
effort by the Mexican government to obtain international environmental
review for a massive saltworks proposed for development on the Pacific
coast of Baja California.</P>

<P><A HREF="../extension/marmammal.html">Bruce 
Mate</A>,
marine mammal specialist for Oregon Sea Grant at OSU's <A 
HREF="http://www.hmsc.orst.edu/">Hatfield
Marine Science Center,</A> is part of an international review team which
has been attempting to pinpoint potential environmental problems which
could result from construction and operation of the proposed San Ignacio
Lagoon saltworks.</P>

<P>This is the first time that the Mexican government has enlisted 
international
help to assess a major development's potential for damaging the 
environment.</P>

<P>The review was prompted in part by concerns expressed by activists,
scientists and environmental organizations inside and outside of Mexico
to plans by Exportadora de Sal (a company partly owned by the Mexican 
government)
to extract salt from the lagoon's sea water.</P>

<P>The company already runs the world's largest solar evaporation salt
plant in nearby Laguna Ojo de Libre. In 1994, the company proposed to develop
an expanded salt production facility on the natural salt flats near San
Ignacio Lagoon. As proposed, the plant would extract more than 7 million
metric tons of salt from the sea water annually, and transport the product
from an on-site shipping facility.</P>

<P>The lagoon lies within a &quot;biosphere reserve,&quot; established
by Mexico to protect ecologically fragile areas. Besides serving as a 
sanctuary
for gray whales, which migrate there to bear their young each winter, the
lagoon houses the largest breeding population of ospreys on the Pacific
Coast. Endangered antelope also inhabit the area.</P>

<P>Concerns emerged that the development could produce waste materials
with salinity levels toxic to marine plants and animals, that its shipping
facilities could be vulnerable to hurricane-force storms that regularly
hit the area, and that the 200-300 jobs expected to be created would not
make up for the displacement of the area's commercial fishers and subsistence
farmers.</P>

<P>In the wake of controversy over the project, the Mexican government
last year invited seven internationally prominent scientists - two of them
Mexican, five from abroad - to review the project and identify environmental
concerns that should be addressed before construction might be approved.</P>

<P>Mate was invited onto the team because of his experience, dating back
to the late 1970s, in studying the gray whales which winter in the 
lagoon.</P>

<P>Other team members included experts from the U.S. National Marine 
Fisheries
Service, the University of Sevilla in Spain and the University of Chile.</P>

<P>Working together since early this year, the scientific team visited
the site, heard testimony and ultimately developed a series of discussions
and questions, called the &quot;Term of Reference,&quot; which the developer
will have to address when preparing its environmental assessment for the
project.</P>

<P>Once the company has indicated how it will address the issues raised
by the scientists, the team will reconvene to determine whether that proposal
is adequate to meet environmental concerns.</P>

<P>Significant to the process, Mate said, is the fact that the Mexican
government agreed to the scientific team's requirement that its report,
the company's response and the team's followup report be made public, 
complete
and unedited, in both Spanish and English.</P>

<P>&quot;This is really unprecedented,&quot; Mate said recently. 
&quot;&quot;It's
the first time where science has been given a commanding - and public -
role in evaluating a major development in a biologically sensitive area
of Mexico. ... I think our group has already made an enormous impact on
making future development policy more open to the public and the 
country.&quot;</P>

<P>Mate expects it will be a year or more before the developer issues its
response to the scientific team's report and the group reconvenes to consider
that response.</P>

<h3><a name="jake">Retired Extension agent honored by national Sea Grant
colleagues (11-6-96)</a></h3>

<p>     NEWPORT -- Robert "Jake" Jacobson, retired Extension Sea Grant 
agent, is
the 1996 recipient of the William Q. Wick Award for Visionary Career
Leadership from his former colleages in the National Sea Grant Marine
Advisory Service.

<p>     Jacobson, who retired in 1995 after 28 years with Oregon Sea 
Grant and
the Oregon State University Extension Service, will receive the award 
during a
national meeting this December in Monterey, Calif.

<p>     The award is named for the late Oregon Sea Grant director,
William Wick, who was instrumental in formation of the
National Sea Grant College Program in the late 1960s. Sea Grant's
Marine Advisory Service Assembly -- a group representing marine
extension agents nationwide -- instituted the award two years ago.
Jacobson will be the second recipient.

<p>     It was Wick who, in 1967, appointed Jacobson as the first marine 
extension
agent in the United States, modeled on a concept developed for the
agricultural community under the land grant college
philosophy.

<p>     Working out of Newport, Jacobson "set the standard for Sea Grant
Extension agents nationwide," said Jay Rasmussen, Oregon Sea Grant Extension
Program Leader, who nominated him for the biennial award.

<p>     Himself a part-time commericial fisherman, Jacobson earned a
reputation for being a catalyst and problem solver between the
region's fishering industry and the agencies that regulate it. He
served eight years on Oregon's Fish and Wildlife Commission, and in
the 1970s helped organize a series of "town hall" meetings designed
to help fishermen and resource managers find common ground.

<p>     He also was instrumental in developing marine safety workshops
for fishermen, at one point jumping off a dock in a survival suit to
demonstrate the product's usefulness to skeptical fishermen.

<p>     Since his retirement, Jacobson has also been honored by the National
Marine Fisheries Service and the Pacific States Marine Fisheries 
Commission for
outstanding contributions to the management and conservation of fisheries
resources.

<h3><a name="whiting">Pacific Whiting team wins OSU honor</a> (9-17-96)</h3>
<p>By Leonard Calvert, 541-737-3311<br>

<p>
CORVALLIS - A team of research scientists, 
engineers, economists, and processing 
specialists received recognition Tuesday 
from the Oregon State University College of 
Agricultural Sciences for its work in 
establishing an on-shore whiting industry 
in Oregon.
<p>
The seven-person team received the James 
and Mildred Oldfield and E.R. Jackman award 
for superior and distinguished 
interdisciplinary achievements.
<p>
Members of the team are Michael 
Morrissey, Astoria, director of the OSU 
Seafood Laboratory in that city; Haejung An, 
Jae Park, and Thomas Seymour, OSU food 
scientists working in the Astoria 
laboratory; <a href="../extension/fisheng.html">Edward Kolbe,</a> Corvallis, 
professor of bioresource engineering; <a 
href="../extension/seafood.html">Ken 
Hilderbrand</a>, Newport, Extension Sea Grant 
seafood processing specialist; and Gil 
Sylvia, Newport, agricultural and resource 
economist with the Coastal Oregon Marine 
Experiment Station.
<p>
The team was cited for its contribution to 
the development of a new value-added 
processing industry in Oregon through basic 
research needed to solve the biochemical and 
engineering problems associated with the 
handling and processing of whiting. The 
team provided technology transfer through 
workshops, short courses, and seminars, 
and also helped the fishing industry in an 
analysis of economics incentives and 
restraints.
<P>
The Astoria laboratory has sponsored 
surimi schools for industry representatives 
from throughout the Pacific Northwest.
<p>
In 1990, less than 5,000 metric tons of 
Pacific whiting were landed off the Oregon 
Coast. In 1995, this had grown to 68,000 
metric tons. Most of the whiting is made 
into surimi at processing plants in 
Warrenton, Hammond, Newport, and 
Albany.

<h3><a name="taxpubs">Publications help fishing families plan 
ahead</a> (8-5-96)</h3> 
<p>By Pat Kight (541) 737-2011<br>

<p>
It's never too early to start planning for tax time,
especially if you're the owner of a small business. And the same goes
for organizing family records so you can quickly lay hands on the
information you need.
<p>
Oregon Sea Grant and OSU Extension family economics specialist Alice
Mills Morrow are offering a pair of tax and record-keeping
publications for families -- especially those whose family members own
or work on fishing boats.
<p>
Both publications were produced for the Fishing Families Project, a
Sea Grant outreach effort aimed at helping fishing families connect
with resources that can help them contend with the economic and social
cycles common to their industry.
<p>
<em>Tax Information for Crewmen on Commercial Fishing Boats</em> is a
one-page fact sheet with up-to-date information about IRS requirements
for fishing crews, who are usually considered self-employed and thus
not subject to employee withholding. The sheet touches on
record-keeping, IRS forms and how and when to seek professional tax
advice.

<p><em>Fishing and Business Records Checklist for Fishing Families</em> is an
11-page, fill-in-the-blanks manual that fishing families can use to
enter information about boat records, family members, important
personal and financial papers, insurance, savings and property records
and other items that are useful for financial planning and
in emergencies.
<p>
Morrow prepared the checklist with help from OSU Extension Sea Grant
Agent <a href="../extension/lincoln.html">Ginny Goblirsch</a>, a member of 
the Fishing Families Project and herself a fisherman's wife.
<p>
Both documents are available free of charge from the coastal county
offices of the OSU Extension Service. Copies also may be ordered
through regional Fishing Family Coordinators, who work with the
Fishing Families Project in the south, central and north coast
regions. They are:
<ul>
<li>
     North Coast - Dyan Hartill, (503) 325-7372</li>
<li>     Central Coast - Connie Kennedy - (541) 574-0082</li>

<p>
     <a href="../extension/seafood.html">Kenneth Hilderbrand,</a> Extension 
seafood specialist for Oregon Sea Grant,
has been cited by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for his national 
leadership
in educating and training seafood processors about new consumer safety 
rules.
<p>
     Hilderbrand, who is stationed at Oregon State University's Hatfield 
Marine
Science Center in Newport, was instrumental in forming the nationwide 
<a href="http://www-Seafood.ucdavis.edu/haccp/haccp.htm">Seafood
HACCP Alliance for Education and Training</a>. The coalition of scientists, 
industry
leaders and agency staff has been working to help processors implement the
recently adopted federal Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP)
system, which provides for a series of boat-to-market check points for 
product
safety.
<p>
     The USDA cited Hilderbrand "for outstanding contributions and national
leadership" in the alliance's work to help processors "provide safe, 
wholesome
aquatic food products to consumers worldwide."
<p>
     While working with the alliance, Hilderbrand has helped
design a HACCP manual and is planning workshops to teach seafood 
processors more 
about HACCP and other food-safety and quality assurance methods.
<p>
     The citation and an accompanying plaque came from the USDA Cooperative
Extension Service's national aquaculture program office in Washington, D.C.

               Summertime pleasure boaters can learn
            much of what they need to know about navigating Oregon's
            coastal harbors, bars and river mouths from a free publication
            available from Oregon Sea Grant.
            
               <p><em>Boating in Oregon's Coastal Waters,</em> now in its 
eighth
            edition, features photographs, maps and warnings about the
            seasonal navigational hazards boaters are likely to encounter in
            each of 20 coastal harbors, from the Columbia River at the north
            to the Winchuck Rivernear the California border.

<p>
A new atlas from Oregon Sea Grant and the Pacific Circle Consortium
examines the coastal zones of the Pacific region, their human
populations and the natural environment in which they live, work and
play.
<p>
<em>Coastal Zones of the Pacific: A Descriptive Atlas</em> is aimed at young
readers from 13 to 17, and is filled with photographs and
illustrations providing information on topics ranging from per capita
automobile ownership to nuclear activity in the Pacific and
distribution of threatened plant and animal species.
<p>
Sandy Ridlington, managing editor for Oregon Sea Grant Communications
and the book's editor, said the book is intended to provide a set of
cross-cultural materials that could empower its readers to understand
the Pacific region and empathize with those who call it home.
<p>
With text by Marguerite Wells of Australia and art by Don Poole of
Corvallis and Anna  Asquith of Hawaii, the atlas includes
chapters on the region's environment, including winds and currents,
beaches and cliffs, wetlands and estuaries and coral reefs and atolls.
<p>
It also covers such human dimensions as pollution, the greenhouse
effect and coastal management and regulation.
<p>
A chapter on original peoples of the Pacific traces the histories,
movement and rights of indigenous groups from North America to the
islands of the central and western Pacific, and other chapters explore
the history and prospects of protected animals, plants and places.
<p>
The 160-page, paper-bound atlas is available from Oregon Sea Grant
Communications, 402 Administrative Services, Oregon State University,
Corvallis OR 97331-2134. The price is $14.95 plus postage and handling. 
Ask for ORESU-B-96-001.

Oregon Sea Grant is part of the national Sea Grant College Program, a
network of university-based marine research and education programs
under the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration. The Pacific
Circle Consortium is made up of science and social studies educators
from around the Pacific, and is dedicated in part to providing
curriculum materials related to the region.

CORVALLIS - Jay Rasmussen, long 
associated with coastal management
programs on the Oregon coast, has been 
named associate director of Oregon Sea 
Grant and leader of the <A HREF="../extension.html">Extension Sea 
Grant</A> 
program. The appointment is effective July 
1, 1996.
<P>
Rasmussen, executive director of the 
Newport-based Oregon Coastal Zone
Management Association since 1979, will 
lead a Sea Grant marine education and
outreach team that includes eight Extension 
agents and 10 specialists in such fields as 
fisheries engineering, seafood, economics 
and marine mammals.
<P>
Extension Sea Grant agents, in communities 
up and down the coast, provide information 
and educational outreach to coastal 
residents, businesses and visitors, usually 
from home bases in offices of the Oregon 
State University Extension Service. These 
public outreach efforts are supported by 
about $1.3 million a year in federal and 
state funds.
<P>
Specialists include researchers and 
academics at OSU's Hatfield Marine
Science Center and at the main OSU campus 
in Corvallis.
<P>
Rasmussen, whose background includes 
college and secondary-level
teaching positions in Oregon and Iowa, holds 
degrees from Utah State University. In 
1977, he went to work for the OCZMA, an 
organization of elected officials 
representing coastal counties, cities, ports 
and soil and water districts. He became its 
executive director two years later.
<P>
He fills a vacancy created last year when 
program leader Bruce DeYoung
shifted responsibilities to become Extension 
Sea Grant's marine trades and coastal 
recreation specialist. Edward R. Kolbe, an 
OSU professor of bioresource engineering 
and Extension Sea Grant fisheries 
engineering specialist, has filled the 
position in the interim.

CORVALLIS - A new book published by the 
Oregon State University Press examines the 
plight of Pacific Northwest salmon through 
a collection of historic documents and 
modern-day commentaries exploring the 
cultural forces behind the fishes' decline.
<P>
"The Northwest Salmon Crisis: A 
Documentary History" is being released in 
time for Earth Week, April 15-21. The OSU 
Bookstore has planned a public reception 
for the editors and authors on Monday, April 
22, from noon to 1:30 p.m. at OSU's 
Memorial Union.
<P>
The book, edited by Joseph Cone and Sandy 
Ridlington of Oregon Sea Grant, features 
documents and photographs dating back to 
the 1850s, clearly illustrating the early 
warning signs of today's salmon crisis.
<P>
Helping to put those documents in 
perspective are 11 commentators including: 
<UL><LI>Michael C. Blumm, director of the 
Northwest Water Law and Policy Project;
<LI>F. Lorraine Bodi, co-director of the 
Northwest office of American rivers and 
former counsel to the National Marine 
Fisheries Service and the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency;
<LI>OSU historian William G. Robbins and 
anthropologist Courtland Smith
<LI>William L. Lang, director of the Center 
for Columbia River History.
</UL>
<P>
The book is unusual, its editors say, for 
focusing on human actions -and failures to 
act - that have helped drive some wild 
salmon stocks to the brink of extinction. It 
chronicles not only the resource's decline, 
but also public and official awareness of 
that decline and efforts to reverse it.
<P>
Although the documents reveal instances of 
human greed, indifference and short-
sightedness, Ridlington said, they also show 
"that the debate over salmon has never been 
a simple one of conservationists against 
exploiters."
<P>
Indeed, the book points out, a cannery 
operator, R.D. Hume, was among the first to 
sound the alarm more than 100 years ago 
about the already flagging resource.
<P>
"There is no question," Hume wrote in 
1893 (in `Salmon of the Pacific Coast'), 
"but salmon were most plentiful before 
civilization had begun its work...when the 
sources of the rivers were unsettled and 
undefiled by the sewerage of the cities, the 
forests at the head waters still untouched by 
man, and the country yet in its natural 
state."
<P>
Both the historic documents and the 
contemporary comments reflect the 
complexity of the resource issues at stake - 
and the complex web of "solutions" that have 
been proposed over the years.
<P>
The book points out, for instance, that some 
biologists believe hatcheries can solve the 
salmon supply problem - while others 
blame hatcheries in part for the decline of 
wild stocks. And Native Americans, for 
whom the decline in wild runs has both 
spiritual and economic significance, have 
their own reasons for favoring certain 
kinds of hatchery production.
<P>
"By collecting these rich source materials - 
many of them obscure and until now known 
only to specialists - we've tried to 
contribute something new to the salmon 
debate," said Cone, whose own 1995 book, 
`A Common Fate: Endangered Salmon and the 
People of the Pacific Northwest,' has 
received critical acclaim.
<P>
"The Northwest Salmon Crisis" is available 
from bookstores and libraries, or can be 
ordered directly from the OSU Press, Waldo 
Hall 101, Corvallis OR 97331-6407, 
541-737-3166. The price of the 
hardcover book is $29.95. Mail orders 
must include $3.50 for postage.

     NEWPORT - The future of the Oregon coast, its human communities 
and
the environments in which they live will be the focus of a two-day 
June conference
called <a href="../coastcon.html">Sustaining Oregon's Coast and Communities 
Issues and Opportunities.</a> <p>
     The meeting, June 6-8 at the Hotel Newport, is being organized by

<UL><LI>
     People and the Oregon coast, including the region's history, 
demographics,
economic and employment trends and infrastructure needs.</li>
<LI>The state of marine and coastal ecosystems, including overviews of
offshore, nearshore and shoreside waters, estuaries, watersheds and 
local
ecosystems.</li>
<LI> Emerging issues: socio-political trends, economic development 
issues,
tourism and recreation, marine resource management and ecosystem 
crises.</li>
</ul>

<P>
     NEWPORT - A newborn seal pup may look cute - and even
pathetic - but the fact that it's alone on the beach doesn't mean
it's been abandoned, or that people should try to "rescue" it.
<P>

     With spring comes delivery time for thousands of expectant
mother seals - and an annual deluge of reports of seal-pup
"strandings" by visitors to the Oregon Coast.
<P>
     
     But it's perfectly normal for a mama seal to leave her
offspring on the beach while she's off foraging for food,
explains <a href="/extension/marmammal.html">Bruce Mate,</a> marine mammal 
specialist for Oregon 
State University's Extension Sea Grant program. The pups are too weak
to swim long distances, and the mothers have uncanny instincts
for relocating the spot where they left their young.
<P>

     A well-intentioned person who tries to rescue such an
"abandoned" pup - by removing it from the beach or dragging it
into the water - may actually be sentencing the young animal to 
death.
<P>

     When a seal pup is removed from the beach, it is almost
impossible to reunite it with its mother, said Mate. The pups are
difficult to feed and rarely survive in captivity, he said.
<P>

     Approaching baby seals can also be dangerous to people, Mate
said. Seal bites can be painful and may cause infection in people
and pets. And people who disturb the pups, even with the best of
intentions, risk being fined under laws which protect marine
mammals from harassment.
<P>

     Mate also urged visitors to keep their dogs on leashes when
strolling along the beach. When dogs run free, he said, they can
scare away mother seals trying to return to their pups.
<P>

     Anyone who finds a baby seal which seems to be in obvious
distress should stay away from the animal and report the sighting
to the Oregon State Police, Mate said. 
<P>
<EM>

Editors: Dr. Mate is out of state on a research assignment until
mid-April. His staff at the Hatfield Marine Science Center can
direct media inquiries to graduate researchers.</EM>

been
named Woman of the Year by the Newport Business and Professional Women's
Club.
<p>
Goblirsch, who lives in Otter Rock, was cited for her work with fishing families,
fishing crews and the fishing industry on issues ranging from on-board safety to
family well-being.
<p>
Herself a fisherman's wife, Goblirsch has been instrumental in Sea Grant's
<a href="../research/atc.html#outreach">Fishing Families Project,</a> a 
coast-wide effort to link fishing crews and their
families with educational resources that can help them adapt to changing
fisheries. She is credited with helping establish a network of fishermen's wives
groups up and down the coast to provide information and support to fishing
families.
<p>
She is the author or editor of several publications, including A Guide to Oregon's
Commercial Fishing Vessels and the Fishing Family and Business Resource 
Kit.<p>

Connie Kennedy, president of the Newport Fishermen's Wives, said in nominating
Goblirsch for the award that she has "taken the lead in preparing the commercial
and charter fishing fleets for unexpected emergencies at sea" by organizing and
teaching marine safety classes.
<p>
"Ginny is one of those people who make a difference," said Oregon Sea Grant
director Robert Malouf. "She is a talented educator and she routinely works well
beyond her job requirements to serve the community."
In 1995, she was named a Woman of Achievement by the OSU Women's Center.

<h3><a name="gillnet">Disaster relief inadequate, gillnetters tell researcher</a></h3>

<p><strong>Note: This survey is now available <a 
href="http:www.orst.edu/~gildenj/gillsum.htm">on line</a></strong>
<p>CORVALLIS - For many Northwest gillnetters, federal salmon
          disaster relief programs have been a case of too little, too
          late, some of them have told an Oregon State University
          research team.
<p>
          In a recently completed survey of gillnetters in Washington
          and Oregon, OSU anthropologist Court Smith heard many
          fishermen express bitterness, frustration and a sense of
          helplessness in the face of the continued decline of the
          salmon, and limitations on their ability to catch the fish.
<p>
          Smith, aided by research assistant Jennifer Gilden,
          surveyed all 666 fishermen who held 1995 gill-net licenses for the
          Columbia River, Willapa Bay and Gray's Harbor.  Fifty-three
          percent responded.
<p>
          The survey is one of three planned by Smith as part of a
          larger research and outreach project funded by Oregon Sea
          Grant under a program titled "Adapting to Change: Fishing
          Families, Communities, Businesses and Regions." Smith
          intends to survey trollers and charter operators later this
          year, and then combine results of all three surveys into a
          detailed analysis.
<p>
          Smith called his report "an effort to represent as
          accurately as possible the perspective of gillnetters,"
	  including their recommendations for improving the salmon 
	  situation.
<p>
	  "This is a new technique for reporting survey results," said
	  Smith.  "Instead of the academics acting as the experts on what to do,
 	  the technique tries to let the people affected give their views."
<p>
          Survey respondents reserved their harshest words for the
          way the salmon crisis has been handled by the government and
          interest groups.  Many said they felt that they were being 
	  blamed for Gillnetters noted how they were being
          blamed for problems they have fought for years, such as
          development of the Columbia River with little regard for the 
          needs of the fish.
<p>
          Fifty-nine percent of the gillnetters said they had taken 
	  part in disaster relief programs, including a 1994
	  unemployment compensation program, habitat restoration and 
	  data collection jobs in Oregon, and $4 million permit buyout 
 	  in Washington state.
<p>
          Asked whether they got what they needed from the programs,
          fully 75 percent said they did not. Some said eligibility
          requirements were too tough; others said applying for the
          assistance was too complicated and demeaning, or that it
          came too late to be of real help.
<p>
          In Oregon, gillnetters said they would have preferred to see
          a permit buy-out program like Washington's.  But some
          Washington fishermen said that program didn't begin to
          compensate them for their licenses, equipment and other costs
          of gillnetting.
<p>
          Of those who did not take part in any relief programs, most
          either did not think they were eligible, or applied and
          were rejected. Fourteen percent of them objected to the 
          whole disaster-relief approach.
<p>
          Smith's report, which quotes extensively from the
          gillnetters' survey responses, notes that fishermen
          expressed willingness to sacrifice to improve the resource.
          But they want others who share responsibility for the salmon
          crisis - dams, sports fisheries, marine mammals, etc. - to
          sacrifice, too.
<p>
          A 12-page summary of the survey is available, without charge,

          Services Building, OSU, Corvallis OR 97331. Request

	  in Oregon and Washington.
<p>
          The Adapting to Change project, of which Smith's work is a
          part, is an unusual effort pulling together six
          teams of scientists to investigate the economic, political
          and social consequences of changing fisheries in the
          Northwest.
<p>
          Working with the researchers are Extension Sea Grant agents,
          specialists and coastal residents, who are developing
          resource materials and community-based networks to help
          fishers and their families deal with change.
<p>
          The project is supported by grants from the National Sea
          Grant College Program, a program of the National Oceanic and
          Atmospheric Administration, of which Oregon Sea Grant is a
          member.  Additional funding comes from OSU.

<p>     CORVALLIS - A scientist who believes he knows precisely when the last great earthquake and tsunami slammed into Pacific Northwest
shores will join others in Oregon later this month to discuss
what can be done to lessen the risks of the next one.
<p>     Kenji Satake, a researcher with the Geological Survey of
Japan, is among the key speakers for <A href="../quakecon.html">Coastal 
Earthquakes and
Tsunamis: Reducing the Risks.</a> The three-day conference runs Aug. 29-31 at the Seaside Convention Center in Seaside, Oregon.
<P>     Sponsored by Oregon Sea Grant, the Oregon Department of
Land Conservation and Development, and counterparts in Washington
and California, the conference will bring together scientists,
engineers, planners and others to map out plans for long-term
seismic hazard mitigation.
<P>     It's a subject whose time has come in the Northwest, where
the offshore Cascadia subduction zone leaves the region prone to
the types of undersea quakes that can send huge tsunamis -
sometimes called tidal waves - rushing on shore with little
warning.
<p>     The most recent such event, according to evidence Satake
will present during the conference, appears to have occurred on
Jan. 26, 1700. Conference-goers will have the chance to view some
of the evidence first-hand, in field trips to several coastal
communities where signs of the historic inundation can still be
seen.
<p>     The conference is intended as a jumping-off point for
ongoing discussions and policy changes aimed at reducing the
risks to life, property, business and communities from future
large-scale earthquakes and tsunamis.
<p>     Participants will focus on long-term mitigation through
land-use planning, structural siting, construction and
retrofitting standards and insurance and finance strategies.
<p>     "A good deal of attention has been given to emergency
response needs," said <a hREF="../extension/coastal.html">Jim Good,</a> an 
Oregon State University
oceanographer who serves as coastal hazards specialist for the
OSU-based Sea Grant program. "But work still needs to be done on
long-term issues. When a tsunami hits, the best emergency
response plan in the world won't do much good if your hospital or
fire station is sitting in the path of the wave."
<p>     Good is the chief organizer of the conference, which is
expected to draw speakers and participants from throughout the
Northwest.
<p>     Along with Sea Grant programs in Oregon, <A HREF="http://www.wsg.washington.edu/">Washington</A> and
California, the conference includes support and speakers from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the International Tsunami
Information Center, the U.S. Geological Survey, California's
Humboldt Earthquake Education Center and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Association's Pacific Marine Environmental
Laboratory, plus the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral
Industries.
<p>     The conference is open to the public, and should be of
particular interest to planners and developers, insurance and
finance specialists, elected officials, emergency managers, port
and waterfront operators and coastal property owners.
<p>     Registration information is available from conference
coordinator Jay Charland (503) 737-1340, or by email to
jcharlan@oce.orst.edu.  Pre-registration is strongly encouraged.

<p>	CORVALLIS - The writing of an Oregon State University faculty member is featured in a new book about the ocean that accompanies an exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution.
<p>	The book, "Ocean Planet," includes work by Joseph Cone among 19 other writers about the sea, including scientists Rachel Carson and Loren Eiseley, explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau, and the novelist Joseph Conrad.
<P>	The book was published to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Earth Day and the opening of the Smithsonian's <a href="http://seawifs.gsfc.nasa.gov/ocean_planet.html"> Ocean Planet exhibit</A>
<P>	Cone, a science writer and the communications director of Oregon Sea Grant at OSU, is represented by an excerpt from his 1991 book about the discovery of seafloor hot springs, "Fire Under the Sea." The excerpt, "A Field of Worms," recounts the discove






ry of an exotic seafloor world off the Oregon coast in 1984.
<P>	Scientists from OSU's Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport dove in a submersible nearly two miles down on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. There they encountered a valley of geysers, which one scientist described as "like Yellowstone underwater." Some of 






the geysers were 40 feet tall and pumped out superheated water.
<p>	In this oasis of hot water amidst the normally cold ocean floor, the scientist-explorers saw five-foot-long worms living in a large group, "like a field of wheat." Meanwhile bacteria the size of snowflakes floated in clumps around the worms.
<P>	Cone's excerpt reflects a principal theme of the book - that much of the ocean is still poorly known and that often our knowledge lags behind our use. The Ocean Planet exhibition, currently at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in Wa






shington, D.C., will <a HREF="http://seawifs.gsfc.nasa.gov/OCEAN_PLANET/HTML/national_tour.html">tour</a> to 11 other U.S. cities.
<P>	Cone, who lives in Eugene, Ore., specializes in writing about the ocean and its resources. His latest book, "A Common Fate: Endangered Salmon and the People of the Pacific Northwest," was published earlier this year.

<p>	CORVALLIS - Allocation is as important as conservation in
solving the escalating conflicts over America's fisheries
resources, an Oregon State University researcher contends.

<p>     Courtland Smith, an anthropologist with years of experience
in Northwest fisheries issues, made that point Monday during a
panel discussion at a national forum on fisheries.

<p>     The forum, "Can America Save Its Fisheries?" was organized
by the National Sea Grant College Program, of which the OSU-based
Oregon Sea Grant is a member program. The day-long event took
place at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.

<p>     The forum was intended to shed light on critical issues
facing the U.S. as it attempts to manage its fishing resources in
an era of increasing competition, regulation and conflict.

<p>     OSU's Smith, who was among more than two dozen national
fisheries experts invited to take part in the forum, was part of
a panel exploring the question: "Are we organized to manage?"

<p>     Smith said that conservation issues, summarized as "too many
fishermen chasing too few fish," often overshadow issues of
allocation, or "to whom and how much." Allocation may involve not
only fishing, but other resource uses and priorities, some of
which may conflict with each other.

<p>     "Allocation is not just identifying the fishermen who can
fish and how much they catch," he said in remarks prepared for
the forum. It is also about "determining what a fishery should do
for society, how much water is available for fish, whether to
protect or develop riparian and estuarine nursery grounds, and
how the oceans can be used for waste disposal, transport and
experimentation."

<p>     By focusing only on conservation, Smith contended, reporters
and public policy makers too often give the impression that U.S.
fisheries are in a constant state of industry-wide crisis. 

<p>     In fact, he said, when one fishery - salmon, for instance -
is under stress, others such as groundfish, may be doing well.
And fishers who are willing and able to shift from one fishery to
another can thrive, even as others suffer economic loss.

<p>     Fishery management issues didn't just spring up overnight as
a result of sudden change, Smith pointed out. Instead, they have
developed over years, in the context of complex and variable
social and ecological systems.

<p>     Solving the fishing "crises," whether they involve Pacific
salmon or New England trawl fisheries, requires setting up
processes for allocating opportunities among groups of people
with competing interests and desires, Smith said.

<p>     Taking part in the forum were national news media
representatives and government and private policy-makers invited
for their ability to raise public awareness and understanding of
U.S. fisheries management issues.

<p>     Sea Grant plans to produce a media resource guide and
conference proceedings in connection with the event.

<p>     Sea Grant is a nationwide consortium of research and
education programs based at 29 universities in coastal and Great
Lakes states and Puerto Rico. The program is funded by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and by
the member universities.

<h3><A Name="funding">Record federal grant for marine research, outreach in
Oregon</a>, (9-12-95)</h3>

<p>   CORVALLIS -- Oregon Sea Grant has received a record $2.9
million in federal dollars for its fiscal 1996 marine research
and education programs in Oregon, program director Robert Malouf
has announced.

<p>     The one-year total is 40 percent more than Oregon Sea Grant
received last year from its parent agency, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration. The federal money, along with
state and private matches, will support more than 22 research
projects involving more than 35 scientists, specialists and
Extension agents.

<p>     "In a year when federal programs have been under intense
Congressional scrutiny, it's gratifying to know that Sea Grant's
work is still considered money well spent," said Malouf. "The
increase allows us to do what we feel will be ground-breaking
work in some areas that deserve more scientific attention."

<p>     The 1996 grant is the first half of a two-year federal
budget allocation; 1997 funding is subject to Congressional
approval.

<p>     A quarter of the 1996 funds will go toward public education
and outreach, including support of Oregon State University's
marine extension agents up and down the coast.
     
<p>     The grant will help support basic research in several 
categories:
<ul>
<li><A href="../research/fisheries.html">Ocean productivity and
fisheries</a></li>
<li><a href="../research/fishhealth.html">Fish and shellfish health and
disease control</a></li>

<li><a href="../research/hazards.html">Coastal natural hazards</a></li>
<li><a href="../research/law.html">Ocean and coastal law, policy and

</ul>
<p>     One new effort, involving both research and outreach, will
bring together six teams of OSU researchers in economics and the
social sciences. By looking at different aspects of fishing -
from family life to regional-scale economics - they hope to learn
more about how people who fish for a living <a href="../research/atc.html">adapt, or fail to
adapt, to changes</a> in climate, catch and regulation.

<p>    Working with the researchers will be Extension Sea Grant
agents stationed from Astoria to Brookings, who will help develop
and deliver educational services, from workshops to resource
guides, to meet the stated needs of fishing communities and
families.

<p>     Several of the research projects approved for 1995-97
continue ground-breaking work undertaken by Sea Grant-supported
scientists over the past several years. 

<p>     Three OSU researchers - Russel Meints, William Gerwick and
Steven J. Gould - will tackle equally innovative projects in
marine biotechnology. Using different scientific approaches, each
of the three is seeking to discover and understand new natural
compounds from marine plant-life - compounds which could be
useful in conquering cancer and other human diseases.
     
<p>     Microbiologist JoAnne Leong will receive continued support
for her pioneering studies into the molecular virology of fish
diseases. Leong is a recognized leader in efforts to isolate
cellular substances called interleukins, now being widely tested
for their promise in fighting animal disease.

<p>     Other projects for 1995-97 will:

<ul><li>Explore the legal implications of coastal salmon recovery
efforts, and develop live, interactive television classes to
extend that knowledge to university students in Corvallis and
Eugene.</li>

<li>Examine the growth patterns of Pacific groundfish species
to determine whether taking too many mature fish weakens the
stocks.</li>

<li>Develop a cheap, simple laser-marking system to allow
fishers to distinguish hatchery-reared salmon from protected wild
stocks.</li>

<li>Develop better at-sea methods for controlling the levels
of histamine, which can make consumers sick, in Albacore tuna.</li>

<li>Study how various types of waterfront restraining
structures might stand up to seismic stress from earthquakes and
tsunamis.</li>
</ul>
<p>     Oregon Sea Grant, based at OSU since 1968, is part of a
network of 29 Sea Grant college programs in the U.S. and Puerto
Rico, using high-quality science to foster understanding and
stewardship of U.S. oceans, Great Lakes, estuaries and
coastlines.

<p>CORVALLIS - A video about the Northwest salmon crisis 

will receive its television broadcast premiere on Oregon 

Public Broadcasting in September.
<p>
The half-hour video, produced by the Sea Grant program 

at Oregon State University, is titled <a href="../communications/video.html"><em>The Return of the 

Salmon.</em></a> It airs Sept. 24 at 6 p.m.
<p>
The video shows the life-cycle of salmon and describes 

how salmon interact with, and are dependent upon, their 

watershed habitats.
<p>
After presenting essential background on the current 

crisis, the program shows how communities in coastal 

Oregon, Washington, and northern California are rallying 

to prevent the loss of their natural legacy.
<p>
"Interviews with local farmers, loggers, fishermen, and 

conservationists provide a clear picture of the dedication 

that may yet bring about restoration of both the salmon 

and the watersheds that people share with them," said 

Joseph Cone, communications director of the Sea Grant 

program.
<p>
Cone, who produced and wrote this film, is also the author 

of a recent book about salmon. The videographer, editor, 

and co-producer was Lynn Ketchum of Agricultural 

Communications at OSU. The narrator was Richard 

Weinman, an OSU professor of speech communication, and 

the music is performed by Oregon composer Mason 

Williams and friends.
<p>

Other OSU faculty participated in the production, 

including Stanley Gregory, professor of fisheries and 

wildlife, and Paul Heikkila, Extension Sea Grant agent in 

Coos County.

<p>CORVALLIS, Ore. - A new half-hour video chronicling the decline of Northwest salmon stocks and people's efforts to reverse that decline is now available from Oregon Sea Grant at Oregon State University.
<p>    <A Href="../communications/video.html">The Return of the 
Salmon:</a> Restoring the Fish to Rivers and Watersheds is designed to help viewers understand the complex environmental, economic and social factors involved in the salmon crisis.
<p>Using rare black-and-white photographs and historic film footage, the video traces how habitat damage, overfishing, unfavorable ocean conditions and other factors helped push the salmon to the brink.
<p>     It then looks at how individuals, groups and communities are working to reverse that decline through on-the-ground watershed restoration projects in Oregon, Washington and Northern California.
<p>     The video features candid interviews with a spectrum of knowledgeable Northwesterners, including a conservation leader, a fishing industry spokesman and an Indian businessman. Among those featured is OSU fisheries professor Stan Gregory, who expla








ins what watersheds are and how salmon fit into them.
<p>     The Return of the Salmon is available on VHS. Individual copies are $30; bulk discounts are available.
<p>     The video may be ordered from Oregon Sea Grant's toll-free number, 1-800-375-9360, or by sending a check to:

<h3><A NAME="sealpups">OSU expert: Leave seal pups on the beach alone</a> (4-25-95)</h3>

<p>     NEWPORT, Ore. - Spring is seal-pupping time, and visitors to the
Oregon coast are likely to encounter newborn baby seals alone on
the beach from now through mid-May.
<p>     The babies aren't abandoned, and should be left alone,
according to <A Href="../extension/marmammal.html">Bruce Mate, marine 
mammal specialist</a> for Oregon State University's Extension Sea Grant program.
<p>     Newborn seals are too weak to swim for long, and their
mothers often leave them on the beach while they forage for food.
<p>     A well-intentioned person who tries to rescue such an
"abandoned" pup - by removing it from the beach or dragging it
into the water - may actually be responsible for the young
animal's death.
<p>     When a seal pup is removed from the beach, it is almost
impossible to reunite it with its mother, said Bruce. The pups
are difficult to feed and rarely survive in captivity, he said.
<p>     Approaching baby seals can also be dangerous to people, Mate
said. Seal bites can be painful and cause infection in people and
pets. And people who bother any marine mammal risk being fined
under laws which protect the animals from harassment.
<p>     Mate also urged visitors to keep their dogs on leashes when
strolling along the beach. When dogs run free, he said, it can
prevent mother seals from returning to their pups.
<p>     People who find a baby seal which seems to be in obvious
distress should stay away from the animal and report the sighting
to the Oregon State Police, Mate said.

<h3><A Name="salmonbook">Regional salmon crisis profiled in new book</a> (3-16-95)</h3>
<p>By Sandy Ridlington<br>
503*-737-0755<br>    <p>SOURCE: Joseph Cone<br>
503*-737-0756<br>
<p>CORVALLIS, Ore. - A new book by an Oregon State University faculty member portrays the crisis over declining salmon populations in the Northwest as a struggle that will shape the character and identity of the region for years. <p>In "A Common Fate: End




angered Salmon and the People of the PacificNorthwest," author Joseph Cone recounts the biological and political crisis over salmon that has emerged during the past decade.
<p>Set in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and California, "Common Fate" tells the story from the vantage point of a small group of participants, including such Oregonians as Bill Bakke, the conservation leader of Oregon Trout; Umatilla tribal leader Antone Min




thorn; and Sen. Mark Hatfield.
<p>The book puts readers at scenes of the crisis - a gillnet fisherman hauling in his meager catch at Clatskanie, Yakama Indians participating in a salmon ceremony at Satus, Wash., conservationists plotting strategy during the 1991 salmon summit in Portla




nd, and a port manager in Lewiston, Idaho, complaining about the impacts of salmon protection efforts.
<p>The book recounts the great boom years of the Astoria fishery a hundred years ago, and the warning signs of a bust that have been accumulating since then - warning signs that have gone largely unheeded, the author says.
<p>Cone, a science writer who is the <A 
href="../comm.html">communications director of Oregon Sea 
Grant</a> at OSU, says he wrote the book to help people recognize that the Northwest is "at a turning point in history." 
<p>"New England once had great runs of salmon," he said. "Those were largely wiped out in the settlement and development of the region. Today much the same thing is happening here. The original natural character of our region is slipping away. 
<p>"The question is, do we want this to occur? If not, what can we do about it? Time is limited, but we need public understanding and discussion."
<p>The struggle to save the salmon in the Northwest now seems likely to become the most costly, complicated and contentious biological restoration effort ever undertaken, Cone said.
<p>Proposals to modify operations of Columbia River dams carry price tags into the billions of dollars, while salmon protection and restoration efforts on public and private forest and range lands could have much broader economic consequences than efforts




 to protect the northern spotted owl. 
<p>The migratory salmon occupy vastly more territory in the region than does the owl, Cone points out. 
<p>"It's frequently said that the salmon crisis will make the furor over the owl look like a 'walk in the park,'" he said. 
<p>The writer says he hopes that Americans can find a way to make peace with their environmental neighbors, like the salmon. The stakes are too high to do otherwise, according to Cone.
<p>"Ultimately the fate of the region, and our own future as well, is connected to that of the salmon, which for millions of years has been the symbol of environmental abundance and health in the Northwest," he said.
<p>"A Common Fate" was published by Henry Holt and Co. in February. It is Cone's second book. His first book, "Fire Under the Sea," won critical acclaim as one of the top popular science books of 1991.

<p>NEWPORT, Ore. - "Getting Unhooked from Anger and Conflict," a free
workshop for fishing families, is scheduled for 6 p.m. Tuesday,
March 28 at Newport's Naterlin Community Center, 169 SW Coast
Highway.
<p>The two-hour workshop, designed to help adults and children
meet the challenges posed by the demands and realities of the
fishing industry, is sponsored by OSU's Fishing Dependent
Families project, funded by Oregon Sea Grant.
Working with specialists in communication and conflict
management, participants will identify situations likely to cause
conflict among families whose livelihoods are affected by the
economic, environmental and regulatory demands of the fishing
industry.
<p>Adults, pre-teens and teenagers, working in separate groups,
also will learn tools for dealing with family conflict without
resorting to destructive behavior.
<p>Child care will be provided for youngsters 5 and under.
<p>Facilitators for the workshops include Mary Zinkin, director
of the Center for Conflict Studies in Portland, and local youth
and family specialists.
<p>Registration is free, but those interested in participating
are asked to sign up in advance with the Lincoln County office of
the OSU Extension Service, 265-4107

episode of the <A HREF="http://www.pbs.org/Welcome.html"> PBS</a> program, "The New Explorers."
<p>     Scheduled for nationwide airing Wednesday, April 5, the
program explores how scientists are using high-tech, cold-war
technology to unravel the mysteries of whale migration and
communication.
<p>     Mate, internationally known marine mammal specialist for
Oregon Sea Grant and OSU's Hatfield Marine Science Center, is one

small satellite transmitters to "tag" whales and then record
their undersea migrations.
<p>     Host Bill Kurtis joins Mate and an international crew on the
research vessel The Odyssey as they attempt the first-ever
tagging of a sperm whale. The cameras follow the vessel through
the South Pacific off the Galapagos Islands as they search for
sperm whales and attempt to affix a radio transmitter to one of
the huge animals.
<p>     The program also looks at the work of Cornell University's
Bioacoustics Research Program, which uses super-sensitive
undersea listening devices, developed by the Navy to track
submarines, to study whale communications.

<h3><A Name="intern">Law student tracks coastal issues through Legislature</a> (3-8-95)</h3>
<p>By Pat Kight, Oregon Sea Grant Communications<br>
(503*) 737-2011<BR>
<P>SOURCE: Julie Coontz<BR>
<P>     SALEM - As Oregon Sea Grant's 1995 Legislative Fellow, a
University of Oregon Law School student is observing first-hand
how the <A HREF="http://www.state.or.us/">Legislature</a> deals with ocean and coastal issues.
<p>     Law student Julie Coontz is stationed in Sen. Stan Bunn's
office, and spends her days attending hearings, studying bills
and testimony, meeting with coastal legislators and keeping
minutes of Coastal Caucus meetings.
<p>     Among the measures Coontz has been following are bills to:
<ul><li>Urge Congress to amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act to
allow the removal of California sea lions and harbor seals to
protect salmon and other endangered fish.</li>
<li>Call for changes in the U.S. Environmental Protection Act
to give human and economic considerations equal weight with
wildlife considerations when listing species as endangered or
threatened.</li>
<li>Require coastal communities and schools to do better jobs
of warning and protecting people in the event of earthquakes or
tsunamis.</li>
<li>Change state land-use laws to require compensation for
property owners when certain types of regulations are imposed on
their property.</li></ul>
<p>     Coontz passes on her observations in regular written reports
to members of the Oregon Coastal Zone Management Association,
which co-sponsors the biennial fellowship program.
<p>     A native of Los Alamitos in Southern California, and
graduate of Los Alamitos High School and the University of
California at Berkeley, Coontz has focused her UO studies on
ocean, coastal and natural resources law. She expects to receive
her law degree in December.

<h3><A Name="fishgift">Fisherman gives gift to OSU Seafood Laboratory</a>  (2-3-95)</h3>
<p>by Pat Kight, Oregon Sea Grant Communications<br>
(503*) 737-2011<br>
<p>SOURCE: Michael Morrissey<br>
(503) 325-4531<br>
<p>ASTORIA, Ore. - The owners of a Newport fishing vessel have given
Oregon State University's Seafood Laboratory $20,000 toward
developing new seafood products from abundant Pacific whiting.
<p>     Fred Yeck and his brothers, who own the Newport-based
fishing vessel Seadawn, want to encourage the Astoria lab to
continue its work on shelf life, taste tests and other factors
that could lead to new whiting products.
<p>     The Seafood Lab already has played a major role in finding
ways to turn whiting - the most plentiful Pacific groundfish -
into surimi, the basis for popular imitation crab, shrimp and
lobster-flavored products.
<p>     Yeck said he hoped his gift would encourage the OSU Seafood
Lab to continue developing value-added products.
<p>     "Currently the industry is a captive of the surimi market,"
Yeck wrote in a letter to lab director Michael Morrissey. "If
other product forms can be developed ... the value of the Pacific
whiting fishery could be increaed dramatically to the industry
and the state of Oregon."
<p>     Michael Morrissey, director of the OSU Seafood Lab, said the
gift shows that the facility's research is on target, and that it
is successfully transferring the fruits of that research to
industry. Much remains to be done in the area of value-added
processing, Morrissey added.
<p>     Pacific whiting, the largest groundfish resource off the
Pacific Northwest coast, represents a significant economic
resource to coastal fishermen and the communities where they
work.
<p>     The OSU Seafood Lab, along with OSU's Extension Sea Grant
agents, have been working with the fishing and seafood processing
industries to find new processes and products that could boost
the economic benefit of the whiting fishery.

<h1>Current Port Management Issues</h1>

<p><i>by Thomas J. Dowd, FCIT - Affiliate Professor University of Washington
- Washington Sea Grant </i></p>

<p>
<hr></p>

<p>Change is affecting virtually every aspect of our lives. To gain a better
perspective on how and why change is affecting ports, it may be useful
to pose and answer a few key questions. </p>

<p><b>What is a port authority?</b> </p>

<p>A port authority is a public enterprise form of government. It is a
hybrid that fits between general government and private industry. </p>

<p><b>What is General Government / Public Enterprise / Private Industry?
</b></p>

<p>General Government is primarily tax supported with a goal of delivering
monopoly services (e.g., police, fire, roads, water/sewer, parks). By its
very nature it is not designed to make a profit or become engaged in providing
non-monopoly services. General government is citizen/voter driven. </p>

<p>Private Industry is profit driven, engaged in offering products and
services in a competitive market place. Private industry is not tax supported.
</p>

<p>Public Enterprise (specifically a port authority) is a form of government
that engages in offering services in a competitive market place. Some port
authorities receive tax support. Port authorities have both commercial
profit producing goals (e.g., leasing facilities, providing shipping services)
as well as public oriented goals (e.g., providing jobs, enhancing the local/regional
economy). </p>

<p><b>How have port authorities evolved? </b></p>

<p>If one looks at the history of the Industry, ports can be characterized
as having three major phases. </p>

<ul>
<p>Phase #1 is the beginning or organizational phase that includes creation
of a legal framework, creation of the port authority - often by vote of
the electorate - and the initial acquisition of property and construction
of facilities. Many of the costs associated with this Phase are subsidized
by taxes, grants, appropriations, and general obligation (tax supported)
bonds. </p>

<p>Phase #2 is the growth phase of the port. This phase is characterized
by the development of more formal strategies to deal with larger and riskier
projects and by decision making based on complex and often interrelated
factors. The port matures financially, going from subsidy to self-sufficiency.
</p>

<p>Phase #3 is characterized by a port being &quot;required&quot; to provide
financial support to a general government with direct payments from the
port, sometimes in the form of billings for services (e.g., fire, police,
roads) or, in response to a &quot;request&quot;, a percentage of the port's
income or working capital (often without concern for the port's profitability).
</p>
</ul>

<p>This last phase came on the scene in the late 1980's - early 1990's
primarily as a result of declining tax revenues and increasing expenses
in general governments (e.g., cities, counties, states). Some ports now
are considered primary revenue sources by general governments and this
trend appears to be growing. </p>

<p><b>Should port authorities make a profit? </b></p>

<p>Quite often the answer to this question depends on the port's ability
to maintain sufficient income from subsidies (e.g., taxes, grants) and
net profit from the port's operations to support the &quot;public&quot;
bottom line projects. However, for most port authorities the answer to
this question depends on what the Board considers as an appropriate balance
between the public and financial bottom lines. </p>

<p>Ports, as public enterprise organizations, have two &quot;bottom lines.&quot;
The public bottom line calls for jobs and activities that support the local/regional
economy while the financial bottom line calls for profit or, at the very
least, self sufficiency (net profit after depreciation but before the inclusion
of tax revenue). </p>

<p>It is important for Boards to recognize that profit is not a dirty word
-- in fact, profit is an essential factor for public enterprise forms of
government such as ports. </p>

<p>Profits or more specifically &quot;Retained Earnings&quot; are absolutely
necessary in order for the vast majority of port authorities to continue
to grow and prosper. Without &quot;Retained Earnings&quot;, a port will
be forced to finance all of its expansion with debt (e.g., revenue bonds);
and that significantly limits, and in time may preclude, expansion. </p>

<p>The question of profitability for many of today's port authorities may
be less of a choice among degrees of viability than a choice between survival
and stagnation. </p>

<p><b>Has the role of the port's Board changed? </b></p>

<p>Yes, it certainly has changed! </p>

<p>The actual day to day management of the Port still rests with the Executive
Director/Manager and the policy setting and the oversight functions still
rest with the Board. However, in the major decision making arena, the Board
now acts more in concert with the Executive Director, especially in decisions
affecting priorities, significant projects or major shifts in services/programs.
This change has come about due to the need to manage risk. </p>

<p>RISK is normally not a word associated with ports or port projects!
This was true in the past, but today risk is associated with many port
sponsored projects/activities. </p>

<p>Historically, Board Members were able to make most decisions in a less
deliberative manner because the risks associated with those decisions were
minimal. Today, this is no longer the true and Ports are reorganizing and
reorienting their decision making process to accommodate the current situation.
</p>

<p>Ports face new challenges and Board Members and Executive Directors
must be far more concerned with the analysis of new projects/activities.
There will be a requirement for more interactive Board/Executive Director
Team involvement especially on strategic decisions, decisions that in many
cases will determine the long-term success or failure of the Port itself.
</p>

<p>For Ports, this translates into the need for a far more deliberative
decision making process, a Board/Executive Director Team Approach. This
process requires that all parties have a greater appreciation of the opportunities
and threats posed by the proposed project, and a clearer understanding
of the financial/political factors and the pros and cons of each option
available. This process will require additional time, effort, energy and
dedication on the part of both the Board Members and the Executive Director.
In effect, the existence of RISK creates the need for a closer coordination
between the Board and the Executive Director. This coordination forges
the Board/Executive Director Team Approach to decision making. </p>

<p>For the Ports that adopt this Team Approach, decisions will be made
that recognize the risks inherent in a project/activity. With a more complete
understanding of all of the economic/political factors and the pros and
cons of the options that are available, the Port can &quot;manage&quot;
the risk -- not be managed by the risk! </p>

<p>Conversely, for those Ports that fail to adopt this Team Approach, decision
making will be more akin to a &quot;crapshoot&quot; than a balanced logical
deliberative process. Most important, without the ability to deal with
risk through the Team Approach to decision making, these Ports may miss
the opportunity to distinguish between the solid opportunity and the latent
disaster before committing their funds. </p>

<H2>Good Tasting Medicine <A NAME="Medicine"></A>for Growing Pains</H2>

<P>Coastal and marine businesses are growing as traditional aquatic recreation
activities -- sailing, fishing, and power boating -- are adopted by an
increasing number of Americans. Even non-consumptive recreation activities
like bird watching and meditation are locating in coastal environments.
There are pains associated with making this growth sustainable. In this
issue, we report on several efforts toward improving business and economics
in the marine trades -- medicine for growing pains -- and most of the time
it goes down quite easily!</P>

<P>Sea Grant MarinaNet tools can help ease those pains. After you read
about different ways that Sea Grant programs throughout the U.S. are helping
marinas and the marine trades grow, we invite you to adopt the ideas that
can help these businesses in your state; share with the operators, too.
In addition, take advantage of our communications technology and use the
online facilities to get direct access to others associated with the business
throughout the country like Texas did (see article inside). </P>

<P>Don't stop there. Tell us about your experiences so that, in the next
newsletter, we can share thm with others and ease their growing pains as
well.</P>

<H2>RI offers easier permitting &quot;carrot<A NAME="carrot"></A>&quot;
to reduce nonpoint pollution at marinas</H2>

<UL>
<P>Does putting up a flagpole at a boatyard or replacing dock planking
at a marina have such an impact on the coastal environment that it requires
a special permit? Handling more than 1,000 permit applications per year
for such activities, Rhode Island regulators have decided &quot;maybe not.&quot;
</P>

<P>With this determination, Rhode Island's coastal management officials
hav e extended a &quot;carrot&quot; to their recreational boating facilities.
The &quot;stick&quot; that balances the deal is implementation of federal
regulations for reducing nonpoint source pollution into coastal waterways.
Because marinas are one of several categories specifically targeted for
nonpoint pollution control efforts, these facilities are the focus of revised
water quality and permitting regulations developed by Rhode Island to meet
federal clean water requirements. </P>

<P>&quot;States were given some leeway in meeting the federal standards,
so we chose a guidance strategy to reduce non-point pollution from marina
operations without putting too heavy a regulatory burden on the marina
industry,&quot; says Mark Amaral, coastal management specialist for the
University of Rhode Island Coastal Resources Center (URI/CRC) and R.I.
Sea Grant. CRC/Sea Grant collaborated with the R.I. Department of Environmental
Management (DEM), Office of Environ-mental Coordination; the Narragansett
Bay Project; the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC); and the R.I.
Marine Trade Association (RIMTA) to develop the marina portion of Rhode
Island's Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program. </P>

<P>The tradeoff: Marinas with formal operations and maintenance plans for
handling the potentially polluting aspects of their business earn the flexibility
to carry out minor maintenance and alterations-such as grading launch ramp
areas-without specific regulatory approval. With the formal incorporation
of this policy into Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Plan, that
New England state recently became the first state in the nation to obtain
federal approval for its coastal nonpoint source pollution control plan.

<H2>Existing data <A NAME="data"></A>valuable to marina balance sheets</H2>

<UL>
<P>Business and economics in the marine trades involve manufacturers as
well as sales of service and products. Businesses in each sector - manufacturing,
marine product wholesale and retail sales, marina service and sales - are
important to the growth of the marine trades. Often, people in these groups
seek forecasts or data that can help them make good business decisions.
Existing data, often in a university's research or a state's wildlife or
natural resources department, can provide valuable information for these
business people. Researchers in Maryland, Ohio, Washington, and Michigan
have demonstrated this clearly.</P>
</UL>

<H3>Economic Impact By Source </H3>

<UL>
<P>The University of <B>Maryland's Sea Grant Extension Program</B> and
Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics developed an economic
impact model of the Maryland recreational boating industry using survey
data from 1993. The model was designed to be updated annually. By using
this model for the period 1993-1995, many interesting factors can be learned
about the industry. For example, in a recent report, Maryland Boating Update
1993-1995, <A HREF="masstaff.html#lipton">Douglas Lipton</A> explains that
the number of boat registrations increased by 2.7 percent, the number of
sales by licensed boat dealers increased by 26 percent, and he describes
the value of these sales in terms of income to the vendors and in terms
of collected excise taxes. Moreover, he uses the data from the model to
demonstrate changes in spending by recreational boaters, and to clarify
the portions that can be attributed to boat sales, to other marine-related
businesses, and even the proportion of recreational boating dollars spent
by the visiting out-of-state boaters outside the state of Maryland. </P>

<P>Lipton pointed out that, depending on the spending category, for each
dollar spent by Maryland boaters in that state, a certain percent 'leaks'
outside the state borders. The amount that remains in Maryland is used
by the supporting industries to create jobs and income, and to make purchases
in other sectors of the state's economy. He also analyzes the total impact
on Maryland's economy. Thus from the model, industry and economists can
learn a great deal about the impact of the recreational boating industry
on a state. For more information on this model, contact Douglas Lipton,
Marine Economic Specialist, Maryland Sea Grant Extension Program, Department
of Agriculture and Resource Economics, University of Maryland, College
Park, MD 20742, E-mail <A HREF="mailto:dlipton@arec.umd.edu">dlipton@arec.umd.edu</A>.</P>
</UL>

<H3>Forecasts for Boat Dealers</H3>

<UL>
<P><B>Ohio Sea Grant </B>worked with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources
Division of Watercraft and the Lake Erie Marine Trades Association (LEMTA)
to develop sales-based boat market indicators for the state's boat dealers.
This information helps boat dealers when making decisions on the number
of boats to purchase for the next sales year. In this project, <A HREF="masstaff.html#hushak">Leroy
Hushak</A>, Ohio Sea Grant Extension, tabulated the Watercraft division's
boat title database into useful categories for boat dealers, financial
institutions, insurance agents, and others directly or indirectly involved
with the recreational boat market. The results are published in a newsletter,
<I>Ohio Boat Sales Reporter. </I></P>

<P>According to Hushak, the nature of the database limits the tabulations
t o some extent. For example, some of the larger recreational boats in
Ohio are not included in the numbers because these are &quot;documented&quot;
rather than titled. Boats purchased in Ohio but taken out of the state
are not titled, and therefore not included either. In addition, there may
be a delay between the time the boat is purchased and when it is titled.
</P>

<P>Market indicators, developed from complete data from 1993, '94, and
'95, provide useful information on many factors including number of boats
titled in different categories, the differences between new and used boat
markets, and seasonal purchasing patterns of recreational boaters. Copies
of the newsletter are available from LEMTA (216-621-3618). To learn more

<H3>Moorage Markets and Marinas Real Estate Value </H3>

<UL>
<P>When a marina owner retires or for any other reason wishes to sell his
or her marina, potential buyers must have the business appraised. Unlike
an office building or a warehouse, a marina is a unique facility that can
be used only for its originally intended purpose - storing boats. Determining
a marina's value requires an understanding of the market for moorage in
the region from which it draws its customers, and, unlike most residential
or commercial real estate markets, very few people track the economic performance
of marinas in a systematic fashion. </P>

<P>In Washington state appraisers routinely turn to <B>Washington Sea Grant
Program </B>(WSGP) for information about marina markets. In 1990 WSGP published
a report, &quot;Moorage Markets in Western Washington: County Synopses,&quot;
which charted three critical market variables at the county or sub-county
level: moorage rates (dollars per foot per month), occupancy rates, and
the size of waiting lists for moorage. The price (moorage rate) at which
significant vacancies start to appear and waiting lists evaporate signals
the market limit in that region - the highest price a facility can charge
and still attract customers from competing marinas. </P>

<P>Even though the market data are quite old, appraisers value access to
th is unique resource. Coastal resources specialist <A HREF="masstaff.html#goodwin">Bob
Goodwin</A>, the study's author, can steer state appraisers to a few key
marinas in the market area being considered for investment. A few phone
calls, perhaps augmented by a site visit, can quickly yield intelligence
about changes which have taken place in the market since Goodwin's 1989/90
survey and enable the appraiser to estimate a realistic revenue stream
for the facility being sold - one of the two basic numbers needed to establish
value. The other number - cost of operating and maintaining the marina
- has be en documented in other Sea Grant supported studies around the
United States which Goodwin has catalogued in the 1,500-volume Coastal
Resources Collection he maintains at the University of Washington's School
of Marine Affairs. A keyword search can be quickly performed on his desktop
computer and relevant documents retrieved and consulted while the inquirer
is on the phone. </P>

<P>As a result of this unique resource, very few marinas along Washington's
marine and adjacent freshwater shorelines change hands without at least
one of the potential buyers' appraisers calling Washington Sea Grant Program's
coastal resources office for helpful information and advice. For information
on how to develop a similar resource, contact Robert F. Goodwin, Coastal
Resources Specialist, Washington Sea Grant Program Marine Advisory Services,
School of Marine Affairs, University of Washington, 3707 Brooklyn Ave.

<H3>Boat Ownership vs. Boat Use </H3>

<UL>
<P>Comparing studies can reveal significant information for marketing and
development. Michigan leads the nation in boat ownership, according to
the U.S. Coast Guard, with more than 900,000 watercraft registered in 1994.
Based on current MSU studies and findings from earlier research, the state's
boaters generate approximately $2 billion in economic impacts through direct
and indirect spending, according to Daniel J. Stynes, MSU professor of
Park, Recreation and Tourism Resources. </P>

<P>According to a boat owner study, conducted by Stynes, Tsung Chiung Wu
and Edward M. Mahoney, associate professor, of the MSU Department of Park,
Recreation and Tourism Resources, the average Michigan boat owner is 56
years old-somewhat older than those responding to two previous statewide
boater surveys in 1980 and 1986. Their median income is $40,000. The recreational
boats are used primarily for fishing (56 percent) and pleasure cruising
(39 percent). However, in a separate study of marina users led by Daniel
R. Talhelm, MSU visiting professor of Park, Recreation and Tourism Resources,
researchers found far fewer marina occupants use their boats for angling
now compared with marina users in 1986. It is not clear whether marina
demand has been constant while anglers stopped angling or whether demand
by non-anglers has grown while anglers have dropped out of the market.</P>

<P>A third study, coordinated in the field by Talhelm and Mahoney, and
assisted by Michigan Sea Grant Extension, produced the first full census
of Michigan's Great Lakes marinas. Its findings show that, for the first
time in the last 25 years, marina supply seems to have caught up with the
growth in overall demand, with nearly 25 percent of seasonal spaces going
unfilled. However, not all marinas had vacancies, and some types of marinas
are more in demand than others. Opportunities for marina development still
exist, according to Talhelm, but only in very narrow market niches, and
only in scattered locations on the state's 3300 mile coast.</P>

<P>This study, when compared with previous marina surveys conducted in
the 1980s, indicates a steady overall demand for marina use since 1986,
after some two decades of rapid growth. Changes in the state's population
and economy and the drop in Great Lakes angling activity seem to be responsible.

<H2>Sea Grant Outreach Affects Economics</H2>

<UL>
<P>In <B>California</B>, <A HREF="masstaff.html#ljohnson">Leigh Johnson,</A>
Sea Grant Extension Marine Advisor in San Diego, is assessing research
needs related to the economics of pollution prevention for marinas and
recreational boaters. A student in agricultural and managerial economics
at University of California (UC)-Davis, Sam Herrick, spent the summer interviewing
marina and boatyard managers, recreational boaters, agencies that administer
environmental regulatory programs, scientists, educators and environmental
advocates to gather information about their economic concerns. Dr. Jim
Wilen, a professor of Agricultural Economics at UC-Davis, is advising on
the project. A small amount of data is already available. </P>

<P>The Santa Cruz, California, Port District dredges 10,000 cu. yd. of
sediment per year, producing clean dredged material, suitable for ocean
or beach disposal. The Port District calculated that, if the dredged material
was contaminated, disposal costs would soar and the harbor would have to
raise monthly slip fees by $1.50 per foot of boat length. By using less
toxic paints and maintenance products and by cleaning up after maintenance
instead of washing everything overboard, boat owners save money directly
for themselves and indirectly for their marinas. A San Diego, California,
topside service has found that boaters who inve st in monthly or quarterly
maintenance save money on a long term basis by preventing major deterioration.
In conjunction with these early findings, Johnson published two brochures.

<P><B>Florida </B>Sea Grant recently focused on the future of boating in
order to assist marinas in program and facility planning. Florida developed
a profile of the typical recreational boat and boater in that coastal state
using data from a technical paper by Frederick W. Bell, &quot;Estimation
of the Present and Projected Demand and Supply of Boat Ramps for Florida's
Coastal Regions and Counties.&quot;</P>

<P>In addition, one of Florida's leading experts on boating issues, Dr.
Gustavo Antonini, has been named the Florida Sea Grant Marine Advisory
Service Specialist for Urban Bay Water Management. Because of the range
of his research has resulted in up-to-date ideas on boat traffic management,
self regulation, live-aboard populations, and the applications of new technology,
Antonini will be able to provide information to the industry upon which
business decisions can be made. </P>

<P>A summary of the boating industry in Florida is depicted in the current
issue of Fathom, a quarterly publication of the Florida Sea Grant College
Program. For more information on these efforts, contact Antonini or <A HREF="masstaff.html#clarke">Marion
Clarke</A>, Florida Sea Grant College Program, University of Florida, Box

<P>The <B>Georgia </B>Sea Grant Program played an instrumental role in
the formation of the Georgia Marine Business Association. One of the Association's
primary functions is to monitor legislative and regulatory activities in
an attempt to determine their affects on marine business activity, and
to enhance the expansion of the recreational boating industry in the state.
</P>

<P>In the fall of 1995 the Georgia Sea Grant Program was active in assisting
the Georgia Marine Business Association in presenting a new coastal boat
show. The event took place in Savannah at one of the Association member's
marina and was hailed as a success by the participants. The Association
is seeking assistance for the 1996 show which will be held at Brunswick
Marina. By 1997, the Association anticipates that the event will be a permanent
feature of Georgia's coastal marine activity. </P>

<P>The Georgia Sea Grant Program provides support that contributes to the
expansion of marina, boating and service businesses. Among other things,
Sea Grant has sponsored educational workshops and field trips to examine
dry-stack storage options, boat washing, and service areas that meet nonpoint-source
requirements, underground fuel storage tank regulations, and the insurance
requirements of marine-related businesses. Satellite video conference equipment
is used to keep the Georgia marine business community abreast of developments
on the national level. </P>

<P>In <B>Louisiana</B>, an Economic Challenges and Opportunities Study
of Plaquemines Parish (county)under an Economic Development Administration
grant has led to an increased involvement in economic development matters
on the part of marinas in the parish. Although the parish's close proximity
to the burgeoning New Orleans market was stimulating investment in sportfishing
services and marinas, communication and cooperation between the parish
officials actively involved in economic development and the new marine
businesses was largely missing. </P>

<P>Through the research and extension project, Dr. Jack Van Lopik,<A HREF="masstaff.html#liffmann">
Mike Liffmann</A>, Brenda Henning, and Robin Roberts brought the two groups
together. As a result, two marinas, Cypress Cove and Venice Marina, are
now actively involved in the parish's tourism development program and are
organizing local marketing and promotion initiatives. For more information
on the Louisiana Sea Grant College Program marina-related activities, contact
Michael Liffmann at (504) 388-6290 or E-mail <A HREF="mailto:coslif@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.edu">coslif@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.edu</A>.
</P>

<P>The link between environmental programs and marine economics extends
to the Clean Vessel Act and encouraging the use of pumpout facilities.
Several studies by <B>Michigan </B>State University researchers revealed
the potential for affecting one of the cornerstones of community development
- drinking water systems. </P>

<P>While public health authorities have not attributed drinking water or
recreational water quality problems in Michigan directly to recreational
boaters, the size and activity of the fleet (4.8 million boat days on the
Great Lakes), combined with characteristics of the coastal harbors (have
poor flushing rates to dilute or redistribute pollution), create the potential
for polluting the state's Great Lakes waters. Because approximately half
the state's people rely on the Great Lakes for drinking water, protection
of Great Lakes water quality is important for Michigan. </P>

<P>Therefore, the Department of Natural Resources is using the Pumpout
Grant Program to facilitate compliance with Michigan's existing no-discharge
rules and required provision of pumpout facilities by public and private
marinas. The studies' results indicate that most boaters would rather not
have to use the toilets on their vessels at all and would go ashore if
they could find appropriate, accessible land-based facilities. However,
that isn't always possible, and the need for convenient, affordable sanitary
pumpout or dump facilities appears greatest in southeast Michigan, Saginaw
Bay and the Mackinac Straits areas. </P>

<P>The preferred and most effective methods for educating boaters on the
importance of using marine sanitation devices and disposing of wastes appropriately
appears to be an integrated system of signs, brochures, and directions
about locations of facilities, according to Gail Vader Stoep, MSU assistant
professor of Park, Recreation and Tourism Resources.</P>

<P>The research reports and draft plan for Great Lakes boat sanitation
facility use and needs were presented to the Michigan Waterways Commission
in early summer. For more information on these studies, contact Gail Vader
Stoep, (517) 353-5190 <A HREF="masstaff.html#pistis">or Chuck Pistis,</A>

</P>

<P>In response to repeated requests from the marina industry, <B>New Jersey</B>
Sea Grant Marine Advisory Service (NJSGMAS), the Marine Trades Association
of NJ, and <B>Maryland </B>Sea Grant conducted an economic impact study
of the industry.</P>

<P>Objectives include: (1) Development of a profile of recreational boating
in New Jersey and its economic impact on the state economy; (2) Development
of a database which can be updatedin future years to provide an indication
of trends in recreational boating and its economic impact in NJ; (3) Utilization
of a format which will be employed nationally by participants in the Sea
Grant MarinaNet Project; and (4) Production and dissemination of results
to the industry and to state and local governmental agencies for use in
policy formulation. </P>

(908) 932-9636 ext.221 or e-mail <A HREF="mailto:AlexWyp@aol.com">AlexWyp@aol.com</A>.
</P>

<P>Helping boaters to locate available pumpout facilities is one way to
li nk environmental conservation with good business. The <B>New York </B>Sea
Grant Extension Program worked with an ad-hoc committee that includes representatives
of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, New York
State Department of State, New York Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic
Preservation, and the Empire State Marine Trades Association to secure
state adoption of a logo and slogan for a broad-reaching campaign on pumpout
use. </P>

<P>After stimulating general awareness in a press release and public service
announcements, the group put together a boat show display to alert recreational
boaters directly. Then, in the spring, a campaign, &quot;Follow the Sign,&quot;
encouraged boaters to use coastal marinas with the signs that included
the state-adopted logo. When people pump out, they sometimes purchase food
or fuel. The state commitment to the project provides all marinas with
an equal opportunity to participate and guarantees state wide awareness
of their services.</P>

participating marina operators have confirmed that the checklist type worksheets
contained in the Guide can be effectively used as a basis for capital improvement
or investment plans. </P>

<P><A HREF="masstaff.html#amaral">Mark Amaral</A>, the demonstration project's

<P><B>South Carolina</B> Sea Grant Extension Environmental Quality Specialist
West McAdams is helping a group of marina owners form a statewide association.
Earlier association formation attempts, motivated by a response to proposed
regulation changes, were limited by interest in the regulation. </P>

<P>Motivation for forming an association is different now. Led by a small
association in the Hilton Head area, these South Carolina marina owners
plan to help each other through cooperation and distribution of information,
thus strengthening each marina while strengthening the industry statewide.
During two meetings of marina owners and operators this year, participan
ts proposed a network of local organizations, sort of like chapters, as
the structure for the statewide association. A survey will be distributed
in the fall to assess interest in this plan. </P>

<P>Creativity is needed to develop coastal properties for recreational
uses . Since most communities and states have limited revenues for recreational
resources, the concepts of pricing, partnerships, and privatization had
to become part of the vocabulary of recreational resource management in
<B>Texas</B>. To do this, Texas A&amp;M Sea Grant Marine Advisory Service
began to conduct programs to teach community leaders how to create resourceful
partnerships between local and state governments, and/or federal agencies
and the private sector. </P>

<P>TAMU MAS takes community leaders on discovery tours of new areas to
learn what has been done to attract tourism and gain needed development
dollars. An information package has been developed for bed-and-breakfast
inns on resource and idea sharing. A set of how-to materials were developed
for rural community leaders to provide tips on building coalitions of landowners,
small business people, communities, and recreational users. </P>

<P>The success of these approaches may be seen in the $44,443,872 in matchi
ng grants for recreation or tourism programs and facilities that were secured
during 1993-94 by Texas communities with the assistance of the TAMU MAS.</P>

<P>A result of a close working relationship between the University of the
<B>Virgin Islands</B> Marine Advisory Service (VIMAS, UPR Sea Grant) and
Virgin Islands marina owners and operators was the organization of marinas
and boatyards into a professional association to represent their interests,
and to help them to improve their operations. </P>

<P>1996. Some of the first issues that AMOVI will address include: waste
oil disposal, insurance, and legislation for the nonjudicial sale of vessels.
The group hopes to control operational costs for member marinas through
negotiating group rates for waste removal and other services that they
now must negotiate individually. They also hope to improve their ability
to promote and publicize Virgin Islands marinas more effectively as a group,
and to participate in the development and implementation of laws and regulations
that will impact them. </P>

<P>AMOVI's inception was due, in part to the work conducted by the Virgin
Islands Marine Advisory Service (VIMAS) for marinas in conducting a one-day
workshop for Virgin Islands marina owners and operators on St. Thomas to
identify and explain the various federal and local environmental laws and
regulations that marinas must comply with and to assist marinas with developing
strategies and practices that will bring them into compliance. For more
information, contact <A HREF="masstaff.html#hinckey">Lynne Hinkey </A>at
the UVI or by E-mail <A HREF="mailto:lhinkey@uvi.edu">lhinkey@uvi.edu</A>.
</P>

<P>University of <B>Wisconsin </B>Sea Grant Advisory Services was involved
in presenting two workshops aimed at pollution prevention and waste reduction
for marina operations and boat repair facilities. The first workshop (March
1995) assisted marina operators in the Lake Superior area. The second workshop,
held in March 1996 in Green Bay, WI, attracted marina operators and boat
repair professionals from northeastern Wisconsin. </P>

<P>Topics addressed at the workshops included solid and hazardous waste
management practices and regulations, state and federal spill reporting
requirements, stormwater management practices and regulations, and exotic
aquatic species. Proper and cost effective handling methods for antifreeze,
fuel, waste oil, paint residues, and bottom-washwater were of particular
interest to attendees. T</P>

<P>he primary sponsor of the workshops was the University of Wisconsin-Cooperative
Extension Solid and Hazardous Waste Education Center (SHWEC). There are
tentative plans to conduct a similar workshop in the Milwaukee area this
winter for marina operations along the southwestern shores of Lake Michigan
and in southeastern Wisconsin. For more information on Wisconsin's workshop

<H2>MarinaNet Discussion Group Helps Marinas Solve Problem</H2>

<P>The MarinaNet discussion group e-mail address (marinanet-mg@seagrant.orst.edu)
provides a helpful contact point for the marina industry. Use of this link
among people in the marine trades can help marinas solve problems. A recent
example demonstrates how the discussion group works. </P>

<P>Several Clear Lake (Texas) area marinas were experiencing problems with
fish kills produced when large schools of menhaden moved up narrow dead-end
channels in marina basins. After the fish depleted the oxygen in the water
column, they died. The resulting cleanup expenses for two marinas-Lafayette
Landing and Seabrook Shipyard-totaled over $30,000. </P>

<P>When <A HREF="masstaff.html#hollin">Dewayne Hollin</A> of Texas Sea
Grant heard about the fish kill, he asked the MarinaNet discussion group
(by e-mail) for ideas that marinas can use to prevent oxygen depletion
in shallow, dead-end channels. The response to the inquiry was extremely
quick. Within two days, six to seven useful responses were received and
forwarded to Galveston County Marine Agent Julie Massey, who passed the
information on to the marina operators.</P>

<P>The Clear Lake Marina Association, made up of about 20 marinas on Clear
Lake, discussed the fish kill problem and some of these MarinaNet responses,
and eventually, began formulating a program to prevent or reduce the incidence
of fish kills in the marina basins. </P>

<P>Running up the red flag about these types of marina problems through
the MarinaNet discussion group can produce quick, helpful responses from
Sea Grant as well as the marina industry. This network, open to all in
the marine trades, expands the number of sources for solutions and puts
new ideas on the table for consideration. </P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">Twenty-Five Marinas Benefited From Clean <A NAME="Clean"></A>Marina
Improvements</H2>

<UL>
<P>Not long ago, when hearing about new government environmental regulation
s, most marina managers would exclaim, &quot;Compliance will cost too much
and will drive away customers.&quot; Now more and more operators have learned
that clean marinas attract customers and bring economic value to the business.
Demonstrating this new trend, 25 marinas across America will be recognized
for their clean marina practices during a special Clean Marina seminar
to be held during IMTEC in Chicago on September 27, 1996. Each has significant,
measured economic benefits from being a clean marina. </P>

<P>For example,</P>

<UL>
<LI>The Lodge of Four Seasons Marina (MO) invested $3,724 in dustless sanders
which capture over 95% of the dust, increased worker productivity, lowered
costs and had a net income from hull services of $10,500 in its first year.
</LI>

<LI>All Seasons Marina (NJ) had a net annual saving of $3,452 from trash
recycling. </LI>

<LI>When Associated Marine Technologies (FL) converted from the traditional
sand blasting to a cleaner closed system which reused the plastic medium
blast (PMB) their net annual income grew by $43,585. </LI>

<LI>By providing pumpout service at the fuel dock, Kean's Detroit Yacht
Harbor (MI) had an $8,400 net benefit in 1995 primarily from extra fuel
sales. </LI>

<LI>Lockwood Boat Works (NJ) saved $28,888 by covering the 10 acre yard
with recycled crushed concrete instead of black top paving and avoided
a major runoff problem. </LI>

<LI>By burning waste oil collected from boat service in a new oil furnace,
West Access Marina (IL) turned an unheated repair building into a year-round
operation for a combined net saving and new income of $18,500 last year.</LI>

<P><I>Credits<A NAME="Credits"></A>: Although the MarinaNet newsletter
is published through the combined efforts of many Sea Grant communicators
and marine advisory agents, the coordinating, editing and production are
the responsibility of one Sea Grant program for each issue. Amy Broussard
and Katie Allen of Texas A&amp;M Sea Grant accepted that responsibility
for the first issue, and in the process, designed the publication. This
issue was coordinated by Marilyn Barrett-O'Leary and Bonnie Grayson of
Louisiana Sea Grant. Web services are provided by Pat Kight, Oregon Sea
Grant.</I></P>

<H3>A <A NAME="whale"></A>whale of a migration</H3>

<P>Just as the swallows come home to Capistrano, the <a
href="http://wwwagcomm.ads.orst.edu/AgComWebFile/EdMat/SG53.pdf">gray 
whales</a> return
each winter to the waters off the Oregon Coast. And just as regularly,
volunteers line up to help coastal visitors spot the gentle giants. </P>

<P>This year, Whale Watch Week begins December 7th, with trained volunteers
stationed at state park viewing areas up and down the Coast. Just look
for the signs that say &quot;Whale Watching Spoken Here.&quot; </P>

<P>Armed with binoculars and brochures, the volunteers can help you spot
the tell- tale signs of migrating whales -- water spouts and the occasional
flip of a gigantic tail. But they also carry lots of information about
the animals and how they live. </P>

<P>The whales passing by at this time of year are headed south, to warm,
protected lagoons off the Mexican coast, where the females will give birth.</P>

<P>By early January, when the migration reaches its peak, as many as 30
whales each hour will pass by Oregon whale-watching spots.</P>

<P>Coastwatch is a public information service of Oregon Sea Grant and this
station.</P>

<H3>Better <A NAME="forecasts"></A>forecasts could help save salmon </H3>

<P>A new Oregon State University research report suggests that scientists
could do much to save declining Northwest salmon runs if they could just
get better at predicting when a Pacific El Nino will occur. </P>

<P>El Nino is the name given to an global climate phenomenon which, among
other things, raises water temperatures off the Pacific Coast. </P>

<P>That can disrupt the normal upwelling of colder water rich in the nutrients
which sea-going coho depend on to survive.</P>

<P>An unexpected El Nino in 1982 and '83 was devastating to coho stocks.
Far from bouncing back, the species has continued to decline for a variety
of reasons, natural and man-made. </P>

<P>So far, forecasters have a hard time predicting El Nino events. But
federal plans to improve the collection and monitoring of ocean climate
data should improve forecasts. </P>

<P>If fishery managers knew an El Nino was coming, they could plan ahead
to adjust harvest quotas and other factors to anticipate the decline. </P>

<P>Coastwatch is a public service of Oregon Sea Grant and this station.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Penguins"></A>Penguins wander far from home</H3>

<P>You might think that a bird which makes its home on the frozen Antarctic
shores would live a pretty protected life. But it turns out that some penguins
wander far enough to put themselves in harm's way. </P>

<P>Researchers with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography traveled to
Antarctica to attach tiny satellite transmitters to young Emperor penguins,
a species which lives on the icy shores of the Ross Sea. </P>

<P>The scientists knew that adult penguins spent most of their time in
ice-congested waters, where they could rest on ice floes between trips
into the water to hunt fish. </P>

<P>But they were surprised to learn that the juveniles swam and waddled
far away -- more than 17-hundred miles, in several cases. Their travels
took them out of the ice packs and into clear water perilously close to
commercial fishing zones. </P>

<P>International treaties protect the rare birds when they're safe at home
in Antarctica. But scientists say those protections may need to be extended
to cover fishing areas farther to the north.</P>

<P>Coastwatch is a public service of Oregon Sea Grant and this station.</P>

<H3>Healthy <A NAME="habitats"></A>habitats help creatures resist pollution
</H3>

<P>Thriving estuaries -- those complex boundaries between river and sea
-- can protect aquatic creatures from pollution by filtering, absorbing
and actually eliminating some types of toxic chemicals. </P>

<P>But new research suggests that estuaries may actually make the animals
which live in them better able to resist poisons. </P>

<P>A South Carolina Sea Grant researcher removed an intact community of
copepods - - tiny, shrimp-like creatures -- from a healthy estuary, sediment
and all. Then he exposed the community to a commonly used insecticide,
one that is normally very toxic to the shrimp.</P>

<P>But the copepod community survived, and showed no ill effects, even
at doses high enough to kill half of the animals in a single-species laboratory
test. </P>

<P>The researcher speculates that something about the estuary environment
helps protect the animals from harm. Further work could lead to better
pollution protections based on an ecosystem approach.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Mexican"></A>Oregon scientist monitors Mexican development
</H2>

<P>An Oregon Sea Grant whale expert is taking part in an international
investigation into how a huge new saltworks could affect the coastal Mexican
environment. </P>

<P>Responding to public outcry over plans to build the plant on a lagoon
in Baja California, the Mexican government invited seven world-renowned
scientists to consider the project's environmental impacts. </P>

<P>Among them is Dr. Bruce Mate, a leading authority on the grey whales
that visit the lagoon each winter to bear their young. </P>

<P>Mate says the team has identified several potential problems. They worry,
for instance, that runoff from the plant could raise the lagoon's salt
content to the point where it could harm the whales and other animal life.
</P>

<P>The development company will be required to address the scientists'
concerns before Mexico allows construction to proceed on what would be
the largest evaporative salt plant in the world. </P>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H2><A NAME="rocks"></A>Sea-floor rocks could be an energy source</H2>

<P>An unusual rock found scattered on the sea floor off the coast of Newport
could be one novel answer to the problem of how to power an energy-hungry
world. </P>

<P>The rock is methane hydrate -- a solid form of methane gas. It looks
a lot like an ice cube -- but when you touch a match to the stone, it bursts
into flame.</P>

<P>An international research team discovered large deposits of methane
hydrate about 50 miles offshore from Newport this year. Formed by deep-sea
pressure from fluids forced up through the earth, the mineral is abundant,
but hard to reach. </P>

<P>Oregon State University researchers involved in the discovery say they
believe the seas hold vast deposits of methane hydrate. With study, they
say, the material could be an important source of fuel.</P>

<P>Still to be solved is the problem of how to extract energy from the
rocks, which decompose into a smelly puddle soon after they are removed
from the sea. </P>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H2><A NAME="shipworms"></A>Study aims to stop shipworms</H2>

<P>For centuries, sailors and seaports have been cursing the shipworm --
actually a clam, which bores its way through wooden hulls, piers and other
marine structures. </P>

<P>New York City alone has spent more than 100-million-dollars over the
last few years to brace shipworm-infested piers and wrap them with plastic
in hopes of preventing further damage. </P>

<P>Now a Sea Grant researcher in Delaware thinks he has an idea for making
the shipworm unable to digest its favorite food. </P>

<P>Molecular biologist Craig Cary points out that shipworms don't actually
digest wood themselves. Instead, they have a symbiotic relationship with
a bacteria that does the digesting for them. </P>

<P>Cary is exploring ways to disrupt the relationship between the bacteria
and its host. If he succeeds, it would be a real money-saver to the maritime
industry -- and much friendlier for the environment than the metal-based
treatments now used to poison shipworms.</P>

<P>Coastwatch is a public information service of Oregon Sea Grant and this
station.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H2><A NAME="toadfish"></A>Toadfish muscles really move</H2>

<P>Who has the world's fastest muscles? No, it's not the cheetah, or the
bumble-bee, or even Michael Jordan. It's the toadfish, a shallow-water
marine fish that looks about as homely as its name. </P>

<P>Scientists say the toadfish has muscles that contract about 200 times
a second to produce the creature's equivalent of a mating call. </P>

<P>The researchers, working at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods
Hole, Massachusetts, compared the toadfish's muscle action to that of the
rattlesnake, which can vibrate its tail almost faster than the eye can
see. </P>

<P>They found that the two creatures, separated by thousands of miles and
centuries of evolution, have developed special, super-fast muscle fibers
that work pretty much the same. </P>

<P>The researchers hope to learn why some types of muscle tissue can expand
and contract so quickly -- when other, slower types of muscle would cramp
up under the same conditions.</P>

<H3>Celebrating<A NAME="Refuges"></A> National Wildlife Refuges</H3>

<P>Whether the day is clear and crisp or wet and misty, early autumn is
the perfect time to visit one of our nation's wildlife refuges. And what
better time to make your visit than during National Wildlife Refuge Week,
October 5 through 13.</P>

<P>America has more than 500 wildlife refuges - and several of them are
located right on the Oregon Coast.</P>

<P>From Bandon Marsh to Cape Meares, from Nestucca Bay to Three Arch Rocks,
each refuge has its own unique landscape and wildlife. High on the list
of autumn sights are the migratory birds - geese, ducks and other waterfowl
- that pass through on their way south for the winter. It's no accident
that bird watchers are among the most frequent refuge visitors.</P>

<P>The first refuge was established in 1903 by President Theodore Roosevelt.
Since then, Congress has placed a total of 508 refuges under the care of
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</P>

<P>Coastwatch is a public information service of Oregon Sea Grant and this
station.</P>

<H3>Barbie <A NAME="Barbie"></A>cashes in on the Keiko craze</H3>

<P>Keiko, Oregon's most famous marine mammal, has a new girlfriend -- and
the deal means money for the foundation that owns the killer whale</P>

<P>. Mattel, the giant toymaker, recently announced a new version of its
most perennially popular doll: Ocean Friends Barbie, complete with wet
suit and a tiny plastic Keiko pal.</P>

<P>In exchange for the right to trade on Keiko's name, Mattell made a half-
million-dollar donation to the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation, which helped
bring the movie-star orca to the Oregon Coast Aquarium.</P>

<P>Keiko, meanwhile, continues to be a powerful tourist draw. Since the
whale arrived in Newport January 7, more than 1.1 million people have visited
the Aquarium. That's almost a third of all the people who have walked through
the aquarium's doors since they first opened in 1992.</P>

<P>Coastwatch is a public information service of Oregon Sea Grant and this
station.</P>

<H3>Ground <A NAME="Center"></A>finally broken on new Seafood Center</H3>

<P>After several months of delays, construction has finally begun on Oregon
State University's new seafood lab in Astoria. And a business-oriented
seafood consumer center shouldn't be far behind.</P>

<P>The new seafood lab will replace the cramped quarters now shared by
two dozen OSU researchers near Astoria's East End Mooring Basin. There,
lab equipment fights for space with reference books, and a former conference
room overflows with computers.</P>

<P>The new lab, at a cost of more than 3-million-dollars, will nearly quadruple
the research center's size.</P>

<P>Laboratory directory Michael Morrissey says the space is desperately
needed for the university's ongoing research into seafood safety, quality
and processing methods.</P>

<P>Private industry is funding the other half of the project, envisioned
as a display, meeting and retail center for the seafood industry. Construction
on that building is expected to start in January.</P>

<P>Coastwatch is a public information service of Oregon Sea Grant and this
station.</P>

<H3>Searching <A NAME="earthquakes"></A>for earthquakes on the ocean floor</H3>

<P>It's not exactly 20-thousand Leagues Under the Sea, but a team of Oregon
State University geologists is getting ready to venture deep beneath the
ocean waves in search of an ancient earthquake.</P>

<P>The scientists will use a special U.S. Navy submersible which is designed
to dive deeper than any other U.S. underwater vehicle.</P>

<P>The Sea Cliff, as the machine is known, has a three-inch-thick titanium
skin that enables it to withstand pressures at depths up to 20-thousand
feet.</P>

<P>The geologists will ride the Sea Cliff to the ocean floor, 60 miles
west of Coos Bay. There, they will take core samples, collect rocks and
get a first-hand look at the remains of a massive landslide that occurred
thousands of years ago.</P>

<P>They hope to use what they learn there to understand more about undersea
earthquakes and their potential for creating devastating tidal waves on
the Pacific shores.</P>

<H3>El Nino: Pacific conditions felt around the globe<A NAME="nino"></A></H3>

<P>People who live along the Pacific coast are probably familiar with the
term &quot;El Nino&quot; -- the name for a mix of warm sea currents and
winds that periodically occurs far out to sea.</P>

<P>According to researchers for South Carolina Sea Grant, the temperature
and wind changes that come and go with Pacific Ocean El Nino events are
key factors in the intensity of hurricanes that sweep the Atlantic Ocean
every fall.</P>

<P>What spells bad news for the Pacific, it turns out, can be good news
for folks back East. During the 1991-94 El Nino, while Pacific coast 
residents
coped with droughts and disastrous floods, the Atlantic experienced one
of its lightest hurricane seasons ever.</P>

<P>Last year, when Nino conditions faded in the West, the East was hit
by 11 hurricanes and 19 tropical storms -- the most in many years.</P>

<P>Scientists say understanding these global connections is a key to better
long-range forecasting that might help people around the world cope with
climate change.</P>

<H3>Record-keeping makes tax time, emergencies easier to handle<A 
NAME="records"></A></H3>

<P>Fishermen and other independent business people know it's never too
early to start planning for tax time. And the same goes for getting your
records together in case of emergencies.</P>

<P>Oregon Sea Grant and OSU Extension economist Alice Morrow are offering
a pair of tax- and record-keeping publications aimed directly at fishing
families and others who work in the fishing industry.</P>

<P>One is called &quot;Tax Information for Crewmen on Commercial Fishing
Boats.&quot; This simple fact sheet has up-to-date information about IRS
requirements and record-keeping for fishing crews and others who are 
self-employed.</P>

<P>The other publication, called &quot;Fishing and Business Records Checklist
for Fishing Families,&quot; is an 11-page workbook with space to record
all kinds of family and financial information that might come in handy
in an emergency.</P>

<P>The publications, developed for Sea Grant's Fishing Families Project,
are available, free of charge, from coastal offices of the OSU Extension
Service.</P>

<H3>National Weather Service looks to new technologies<A 
NAME="weather"></A></H3>

<P>People who work and play on the sea keep a sharp eye on the weather
- and they'll soon be getting more help from the agency that's charged
with giving them weather forecasts and warnings.</P>

<P>The National Weather Service is embarking on the most ambitious 
technological
change in its 125-year-history.</P>

<P>Forty-year-old weather radar systems are being replaced by new Doppler
radar, capable of measuring storm and wind patterns in greater detail than
ever before.</P>

<P>Not only will the weather service be able to track existing storms,
but it will also be able to watch developing wind patterns that could turn
into storms days later.</P>

<P>The service is also restructuring its field operations to provide 
high-tech
monitoring of storms, winds and atmospheric changes.</P>

<P>By the end of the decade, Weather Service officials say they expect
to provide substantially better forecasts and warning services for coastal
and inland communities.</P>

<H3>Sea Level rise: What does the future hold?<A NAME="level"></A></H3>

<P>Scientists around the world generally agree that the sea level is rising
-- and will continue to rise in the century ahead.</P>

<P>Researchers for Maryland Sea Grant say historic records show that the
global sea level has risen 18 centimeters - about 7 inches-- since the
late 1800s. The rise has mirrored a corresponding shift in global 
temperatures:
as the air temperature goes up, polar ice and glaciers melt, and the oceans
themselves expand to take up more space.</P>

<P>Most scientists expect the rise to continue and even speed up in the
century ahead. Their best scientific guess is that sea levels around the
world could rise by 41 centimeters - more than 16 inches -- over the next
100 years.</P>

<P>That could speed beach and sea cliff erosion, submerge low-lying coastal
lands and dump saltwater into surface streams and underground fresh water
supplies. Increased flooding and storm damage are also expected.</P>

<P>Researchers warn that coastal communities need to start planning now
for the possible consequences of higher sea levels to come.</P>

<h3><a name="Hatcheries"></a>Hatcheries not the answer to dwindling wild
salmon stocks</h3>

<p>A new Washington State study suggests that hatcheries may not be the
best way to bolster dwindling wild salmon stocks in the Pacific Northwest.
</p>

<p>The two-year study examines fisheries management practices in Washington's
Willapa Basin, historically one of the Northwest's richest wild salmon
habitats. Human activities have ruined as much as 40 percent of the region's
stream beds, and declining fish runs have closed canneries, and crippled
sports and commercial fisheries.</p>

<p>According to the study, efforts to replace wild stocks with hatchery
fish have produced mixed results, at best. </p>

<p>Although coho and chinook runs increased, pond breeding has produced
genetically inferior fish that are more susceptible to disease, predators
and natural disaster. </p>

<h3>Sea <a name="urchins"></a>urchins: Lucrative but limited fishery</h3>

<p>In barely 10 years, an exclusive group of divers off the Oregon coast
have created a small but lucrative fishery harvesting a spiny creature
that lives on the bottom of the sea. </p>

<p>Sea urchins are harvested for their reproductive parts, which are prized
as a delicacy in Japan and in American sushi restaurants. Since 1986, divers
have been plucking urchins from the undersea reefs off Port Orford, Gold
Beach, Brookings and Depoe Bay. </p>

<p>The harvest peaked in 1990, when 60 divers hauled in 9.2 million pounds
of sea urchins. At that rate, many believed the stock could be depleted
in just a few years. </p>

<p>So the divers got together with state regulators and agreed to limit
the number of sea urchin permits. Only 38 permits now exist, and the goal
is to cut the number to 30 as divers retire or sell their businesses. </p>

<h3>Oregon floods test space-age disaster<a name="system"></a> system</h3>

<p>Last winter's Oregon floods allowed scientists at Oregon State University
to fine- tune a satellite-based radar system that could help save thousands
of lives around the world. </p>

<p>The system combines old radar technology, satellite video images and
the latest developments in the Internet to provide information about natural
disasters as they occur. </p>

<p>During the February floods, OSU researchers hooked up with a newly launched
Canadian satellite which used microwaves to create accurate, real-time
images of the flooding, day and night. </p>

<p>The scientists then used the Internet to help move that information
instantly to emergency managers across the state, alerting them to changes
in the flood's progress. </p>

<p>Such technology, scientists say, could be a life-saver in frequently
flooded areas such as Bangladesh, where as many as 20,000 people die in
seasonal floods each year. </p>

<h3>&quot;Coastal&quot; zone <a name="zone"></a>reaches all the way to
the mountains </h3>

<p>When most people think of the coast, they picture that thin band of
surf, sand and seacliff bordering the ocean. </p>

<p>But to researchers and policy-makers in the Pacific Northwest, &quot;coastal&quot;
goes all the way to the mountains. </p>

<p>From salmon to spotted owls, from water pollution to overpopulation,
many issues facing the coast are intimately connected with what happens
farther inland -- and with the way inland issues are resolved. </p>

<p>Speaking to members of The Coastal Society in Seattle last month, U.S.
Navy spokesman Walter Riggs described how 13 federal agencies are working
together in an effort called the Coastal America Initiative. Their goal
is to provide a coordinated, region- wide approach to such issues as endangered
species and toxic waste cleanup. </p>

<p>Among other things, the group will focus on how one agency's actions
affect the work of another, and how all those actions affect coastal communities
and the environment. </p>

<h2><a name="esa">Endangered species may get back in the Act</a></h2>
<p>Now that a year-long moratorium on the Endangered Species Act has been
lifted, biologists across the country are back at work trying to understand what
plants and animals are in danger of extinction.
<p>Back in April 1995, Congress told the Fish and Wildlife Service to stop
adding names to the Endangered Species list. After much political and budget
maneuvering, President Clinton lifted the moratorium this spring.
<p>In the meantime, a backlog of cases and lawsuits involving more than 240
species had built up. In some cases, people want a plant or animal added to the
list. In others, they want the government to remove an organism from the list.
<p>One of the first cases in the backlog has been resolved -- and with great
fanfare. California's red-legged frog, made famous by Mark Twain in his story
about the jumping frog of Calaveras County, was added to the Endangered species
list in May.

<hr>
<h2><a name="whales">How long do whales live? Eskimo find may give clues.</a></h2>

<p>Among the many mysteries about the lives of whales, one question has yet
to be fully answered: How long do these giant marine mammals live?
<p>One clue may come from a surprising discovery made by Eskimo whale
hunters in Barrow, Alaska. 
<p>Embedded deep inside the  blubber of a bowhead whale, the hunters found
two stone harpoon points -- the same kind their forebears stopped using more
than 100 years ago.
<p>The stone points were used for thousands of years by Inupiaq (in-NOO-pee-
ak) Eskimos hunting whales in the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean. They abandoned
the stone technology around 1870, when traders brought in steel harpoon points
that lasted longer and held a sharper edge.
<p>The Eskimo find by itself does not prove that the whale in question was
over 100 years old. But marine mammal experts say it does add to the evidence
that bowheads may live much longer than anyone had thought.

<h2><a name="safety">Recipe for water safety: Stay sober, wear a life jacket</a></h2>

<p>If you want to improve your odds of staying alive on the water this summer,
experts recommend two things: Stay sober -- and wear your life jacket.
<p>The Coast Guard says most boating deaths occur when small boats capsize, 
or when people fall out of them. And most fatalities occur in good weather and
broad daylight, not during storms or heavy seas.
<p>Most victims aren't novices, either. Statistics show that boating deaths often
involve people with quite a bit of experience on the water.Nearly half of all
boating accidents involve people who have been drinking alcohol.
<p>Maybe it's the drinking -- or maybe it's just overconfidence -- but it turns
out that as many as 80 percent of those killed while boating weren't wearing their
life jackets. 
<p>Whatever the reason, authorities in Oregon and elsewhere are working
hard this summer to enforce life jacket laws. They're hoping to reverse last year's
six percent jump in boating deaths across the country -- the first such rise after
several years of steady declines.

<hr>
<h2><a name="sharks">Is man killing off "man-killing" sharks?</a></h2>

<p>Sharks are formidable hunters, the top of the ocean's food chain. But sharks
themselves are falling prey to an even more daunting predator: Humankind.
<p>According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, the commerical harvest
of shark meat increased more than 14-fold in the past decade, to more than seven-
thousand tons a year. 
<p>Many sharks are killed needlessly or wastefully -- by getting caught in
driftnets, or in a practice known as "finning," where the fisherman slices off the
animal's fin and throws the shark back in the sea to die. Shark fins, considered a
delicacy in Asia, sell for as much as $50 a pound.
<p>Marine biologists fear that uncontrolled fishing may wipe out several
species of shark, and are calling for education to teach people the important role
sharks play in the marine ecosystem.
<p>Sharks are highly evolved, adaptive creatures that function in the sea much
as a lion functions on the Serengeti -- to keep prey species strong and healthy by
culling out the weak and the sick.

<h2><a name="birdnets">Scientists try sound to keep birds from nets</h2>
<p>Many sea birds live on fish - and during gillnetting season, that can spell trouble
for thousands of puffins, murres (MYOORS) and other fish-eating birds off the Pacific
coast.
<p>Diving for the same fish that gillnetters are trying to catch, the birds can get
tangled in the nets and dragged to a watery death.
<p>A research team from Washington Sea Grant has been working with the Oregon
Coast Aquarium to try to find out whether underwater sounds might be used to warn
birds away from the dangerous nets.
<p>The scientists set up hydrophones - underwater microphones - in pools at the
Newport aquarium's aviary. Then they played sounds through the devices, and watched
the captive puffins, murres and oystercatchers to see whether they showed a discernable
response.
<p>Early results indicate that the birds did notice the sounds - and better yet, that
they weren't attracted to them. That gave the scientists the green light to begin testing
their system in the field, knowing they would not be endangering the birds.

<h2><a name="waterfowl">Three-nation effort brings back waterfowl</a></h2>

<p>Wildlife agencies in the U.S., Canada and Mexico are celebrating the
success of a 10-year effort to protect North American waterfowl by taking care of
the wetlands where they nest and feed.
<p>Scientists have long blamed habitat destruction -- by human hand or
natural drought -- for a long, downward spiral in populations of ducks, geese and
other migratory waterfowl.. 
<p>In 1985, with breeding populations of some species at an all-time low, the
governments of Canada, Mexico and the U.S. signed an international agreement
committing them to protect, restore or enhance millions of acres of wetlands.
<p>Joining in the effort were thousands of hunters, birdwatchers, developers,
conservationists and other private citizens in all three countries.
<p>This public-private undertaking has helped bring breeding populations of
many water birds to near 1970 levels.

<h2><a name="murrelet">Murrelet habitat slated for protection</a></h2>

<p>Nearly four-million acres of mostly federal land in Washington, Oregon and
California have been declared critical habitat for a rare seabird called the marbled
murrelet. (myoor-uh-LET)
<p>The small bird, which nests in mature and old-growth forests near the
ocean, is considered a threatened species, partly because of habitat loss. Acting
under a federal court order, the Fish and Wildlife Service made the critical
habitat designations last month.
<p>Fish and wildlife officials say most of the designated areas are already
covered by the president's Forest Plan, which limits timber harvesting and other
activities. Those areas won't see much change as a result of the murrelet ruling. 
<p>The designation does not automatically ban logging or other forest
activities, but it does require the agencies that oversee those activities to take
steps to protect areas believed critical to the bird's survival.

<h2><a name="atlas">Sea Grant atlas explores the Pacific Rim </a></h2>

<p>Have you ever wondered how pollution affects the Pacific ocean and its
shores? Are you curious about the people, plants and animals that call the region
home?
<p>A new atlas from Oregon Sea Grant may hold the answers to some of your
questions. Aimed at young readers from junior high to high school age, the book
explores the coastal zones of the Pacific, the people who live there and the
environment in which they live, work and play.
<p>Filled with photographs and illustrations, the atlas is designed to help
readers understand the region and the many different cultures that call it home.
<p>Chapters cover the Pacific environment, from ocean currents to beaches and
wetlands ... such human factors as pollution and coastal regulation ... and the
history and prospects of protected animals, plants and places.

<h2><a name="survive"> Salmon survival: What happens at 
sea?</h2>
<p>
     Science has a relatively good grasp of what it takes for salmon to 
survive during
the time they spend in Northwest rivers and streams. What's missing is 
detailed
information about what happens to the fish once they head out to sea.
<p>
     There are signs, though, that large-scale shifts in climate and 
ocean conditions
could be just as important to the salmon's survival as anything that 
happens in fresh
water.
<p>
     More than 100 scientists met in Newport recently to share what they 
know about
salmon survival - and to call for more and better research about what 
they don't know.
<p>
     The group agreed that long-term climate shifts, spanning decades or 
more, are
probably having direct effects on fish survival. But they're not sure 
what those changes
are, or exactly what they mean to ocean life.
<p>
     Closer to shore, researchers called for more study of coastal 
estuaries, and the role
they play in providing a safe place for salmon to make the transition 
from fresh water to
salt water - and back again.

<h2><a name="coastcon">Conference to focus on Oregon coast</a></h2>

<p>     What kind of place do Oregonians want their coast to be? How can the 
coast
support a growing number of residents and visitors - without losing the 
natural beauty
and diversity that draw people there in the first place?
<p>
     Those are some of the questions coastal residents, policy makers and 
scholars will
consider on June 6 and 7 when they meet at the Hotel Newport for a 
conference entitled:
<a href="../coastcon.html">Sustaining Oregon's Coast and Communities: Issues 
and Opportunities.</a>
<p>
     Participants will try to understand - and help define - the issues 
facing the region
as it moves into the 21st century.
<p>
     Oregon Sea Grant, the OSU-based marine research and education 
program, is
sponsoring the conference in an effort to identify subjects worthy of 
future research
funding. 
<p>
     The conference is open to the public. For more information, contact

<h2><a name="habitat">Fish habitat structures survive the 
floods</a></h2>

<p>     There's good news on the watershed restoration front: Not only did 
most in-stream
fish habitat projects survive the big floods of February, but in some 
areas they even
helped diminish flood damage.
<p>
     That's the word from biologists for the Oregon Department of Fish 
and Wildlife,
who spent the past two months inspecting habitat projects that some 
feared might have
been washed away by the flood.
<p>
     It's true, the biologists say, that the high waters moved some of 
the logs and
boulders that had been placed in rivers to help create salmon spawning 
pools. But they
rarely moved far, and new pools are already forming where the debris was 
deposited.
<p>
     On some coastal rivers, well-established habitat structures actually 
helped
disperse the power of the flood. 
<p>
     Department biologists say the lesson is simple: Well-designed 
restoration projects
can have beneficial effects not only for the fish, but for the rivers and 
streams where they
are placed.

<h2><a name="spring">Springtime on the Oregon 
Coast</a></h2>

<p>     A blustery spring may keep the faint-hearted indoors, but those who 
venture
outside on the Oregon coast can always find interesting things to do and see.
<p>
     Bundle up, grab your binoculars and a tide table, and head for your 
favorite beach.
There, you'll find driftwood, shells and other fascinating items 
deposited on the sand by
winter storms and floods. 
<p>
     At this time of year, you might spot a baby seal, basking on the 
beach while its
mother forages nearby for food. Keep your distance - it's against the law 
to disturb
marine mammals, and bothering a pup may scare its mother away.
<p>
     While thousands of people flock to see Keiko, the captive orca, 
don't forget that you
can see other whales - the migrating gray whales - for free, and without 
standing in line.
All it takes is a clear day, a decent vantage point and sharp eyes.
<p>
     If you're still stuck for things to do on the coast, stop by the 
local office of the OSU
Extension Service and ask about brochures, classes and workshops covering 
everything
from clam-digging to local lore.

<<h2><a name="nonpoint">New video pinpoints pollution threats</a></h2>
<p>
     America's drinking water is less threatened these days by big 
industry, and more
by pollutants that run off our farms, forests, construction sites and 
city streets.
<p>    That's the message of a new Oregon State University video called 
"We All Live
Downstream," which looks at rural and urban run-off, and the problems it 
creates for
surface and ground water.
<p>      Produced by the OSU Extension Service, the documentary tells the 
story of non-
point source pollution - the toxic substances washed into our rivers, 
lakes and streams by
rain and irrigation water.
<p>      OSU Extension specialist Ron Miner, who helped produce the new 
video, says it
shows how Oregon communities and their citizens are trying to reduce 
pollution from
runoff. The video also offers tips to help people protect their drinking 
water sources.
<p>      Information about ordering the $30 video is available from local 
OSU Extension
offices.

<h2><a name="flooding">Flooding fallout hits clams, oysters</a></h2>

<p>      More than a month after a devastating flood swept through much 
of Western
Oregon, the disaster is still being felt at the edge of the sea.
<p>      Floodwaters rushing down from the mountains sent billions of 
gallons of fresh
water surging into the usually salty bays and tidal zones where Oregon's 
clams and
oysters live and reproduce. 
<p>      The flood killed untold numbers of clams, and did thousands of 
dollars worth of
damage to some commercial oyster beds.
    <p>  It's not that the remaining shellfish are bad to eat. But there 
aren't likely to be as
many of them, and that could spell bad news for coastal residents and 
visitors who enjoy
digging for clams.
<p>      It could be months, fish and wildlife officials say, before the 
full extent of the
damage is known. In the meantime, experts caution weekend clam-diggers to 
look closely
at the shellfish they uncover. If a clam is open, or closes very slowly 
when it is touched,
then it is dead or dying and not fit for consumption.

<h2><a name="measure">Washington students devise clever way to measure 
catch</a></h2>

<p>      How many fish did you catch today? Recreational anglers can 
answer that
question quickly, but it's not so easy for commercial fishermen -- or for 
those trying to
manage the fisheries.
<p>      A team of engineering students from the University of Washington 
may have come
up with a new system to solve that problem.
<p>      Most measurement systems involve estimating catch based on the 
volume of
fishing nets or holding bins. But that doesn't work well for species like 
rockfish, which
have spines that tend to make them pile up in the bins.
<p>      The student team has developed an ultrasound sensor that works 
something like a
policeman's radar gun. The sensor emits a signal that bounces off the 
fish and returns a
set of numbers that can be used to calculate how much fish is in the bin.
<p>      Regulators would love to find a better way to measure the catch. 
If catch is
consistently underestimated, harvests may go over  quotas and deplete the 
fish stock.
Over-estimates could force quota reductions and cost fishermen money.

<h2><a name="volcano">Undersea volcano: Shake, rattle and roll</a></h2>

<p>      A sophisticated device designed to let the Navy listen for 
submarines during the
Cold War is helping peace-time scientists make hot discoveries off the 
Oregon coast.
<p>      Known as the Sound Surveillance System, the device consists of 
hundreds of
underwater microphones, strung out on the sea floor every five to 15 
miles and linked to
computers that record and analyze underwater sounds.
<p>      Scientists at Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science 
Center in Newport
have been using the system to eavesdrop on the sea floor ever since it 
was declassified by
the Navy a few years back.
<p>      Last month, the system picked up a sudden upsurge in earthquake 
activity near
the Gorda Ridge, an undersea formation about 100 miles west of Coos Bay.
<p>      The upheaval appears to be the birth pangs of a new undersea 
volcano two miles
underneath the surface of the sea. If so, it would be the second volcano 
the Newport
scientists have detected with the listening device since 1993.

<h2><a name="floods">Floods could benefit 
fish</a></h2>
<p>
     February's widespread flooding spelled disaster for many Oregonians. But the jury
is still out on the flood's long-term effects on fish and wildlife.
<p>     Raging water carried torrents of mud and debris down many coastal 
Oregon
streams, scouring out the gravel spawning beds where coho and chinook eggs were almost
ready to hatch. The floods also damaged many hatcheries, sending an estimated one-and-
a-half million salmon fingerlings to almost certain death.
<p>     But in the long run, salmon experts say, the devastation could 
actually be good
news for salmon and their habitats - as long as people resist the temptation to clean up
the mess.
<p>     By depositing fallen trees and other large, woody debris in prime 
salmon streams,
the flood should help create new gravel beds for spawning, and pools where young fish
can mature.
<p>     With careful management, officials say, the floods could become 
Mother Nature's own large-scale habitat restoration plan.

<h2><a name="orca">Celebrity whale sparks interest in sea 
mammals</a></h2>
<p>     The hoopla over Oregon's newest aquatic celebrity, Keiko the killer 
whale, has
spurred new public interest in marine mammals in general, and whales in particular.
<p>     The 17-year-old Keiko, now at home in the Oregon Coast Aquarium, is 
a mere
adolescent as killer whales go. In the wild, the striking black-and-white whales, also
known as orcas, may live to be 50 years or older.
<p>     Orcas are found in all the world's oceans, and some groups behave 
differently than
others. Pacific orcas are highly social animals, traveling in pods of three to 40 animals
and often cooperating as they hunt and feed.
<p>     Speaking of food, orcas enjoy the most diverse diet of any whale, 
dining with equal
pleasure on birds, fish, squid, turtles and other marine mammals. And lots of them:
Keiko, for instance, is eating about 220 pounds of fish a day.
<p>     At maturity, male orcas average 26 feet in length and eight tons in 
weight, making them among the smaller whales.

<h2><a name="water">Oregon joins in nationwide drive for clean 
waterways</a></h2>

<p>     Boating and sport-fishing can be wonderful pastimes - but not if 
everyone around you is using the water as a toilet.
<p>     Conservation agencies across the U.S. have launched a new campaign 
to persuade
boaters to dispose of human waste on land, in environmentally friendly dump stations
and pump-out sites, instead of releasing their foul cargo into the water.
<p>     Oregon Sea Grant and the Oregon State Marine Board have joined the 
campaign
with a new publication called "Protecting Oregon Waters." The 16-page pamphlet is filled
with practical tips boaters can use to prevent marine pollution.
<p>     The guide includes a map showing the locations of public pump-outs, 
dump
stations and floating restrooms all over the state. It also tells boaters how they can
prevent oil and fuel spills, and reduce their use of toxic chemicals that may pollute the
water.
<p>     Copies of the free brochure are available from the state Marine 
Board, from the
Oregon Sea Grant office at Oregon State University, or from OSU Extension offices up
and down the coast.

<h2><a name="coquille">New book looks at early coastal 
inhabitants</a></h2>

<p>     People have lived along southern Oregon's Coquille Estuary for at 
least 3-thousand
years. But only recently have scientists begun to piece together a picture of how the
earliest of those residents lived.
<p>     A new book edited by Oregon State University anthropologist Roberta 
Hall pulls
together much of what is known about those early Oregonians, and how they coped with
massive earthquakes, floods and other changes in their environment.
<p>     Hall and other researchers have identified many different groups 
who lived along
the Coquille, using the river for trade as well as transport.
<p>     Digs have turned up clay cooking vessels dating back to the time of 
Christ, and
woven fish weirs that have survived for centuries. Among other things, evidence shows
that prehistoric women often suffered arthritis of the right elbow - indicating that they
put a lot of time and effort into preparing food.
<p>     Hall's book, "People of the Coquille Estuary," is available through 
the OSU Book Store.

<h2><a name="seatauqua">Seatauqua chases winter 
doldrums</a></h2>
<p>
Trapped in the winter doldrums? Take a trip to Newport and the Hatfield Marine Science Center
and shake the blahs by learning something new.
<p>
Although the center's public wing remains closed for a five-million-dollar renovation, Oregon State
University is still offering tons of classes, workshops and lectures as part of its winter Seatauqua
program.
<p>
From hands-on lessons in clamming and crabbing to winter-time walking tours through Newport's
historic neighborhoods, Seatauqua offers something for just about every coastal interest. Natural
history, ecology, geology and the lives of sea birds and mammals are just a few of the topics
covered by more than 60 separate classes.
<p>
There are special Saturday science classes for kids, and even a late-February sleep-over at the
nearby Oregon Coast Aquarium. 
<p>
Fees are charged to cover class materials, and pre-registration is required for most activities. For
more information, contact the Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport.

<H2><a name="anglers">Young anglers on the 
increase</a></h2>
<p>
The image of a kid with a fishing pole used to be just about as American as you could get. But over
the past couple of decades, fewer and fewer young Oregonians were responding to the lure of rod
and reel.
<p>
The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife says that's changing, thanks to efforts by a team of
grown-up volunteers to teach kids about fishing and good fishing practices.
<p>
The department says the low point came in 1992, when about 30-thousand fishing licenses were
sold to Oregon youths. But as of last season, the number stood at 34-thousand and rising.
<p>
That's still way short of the all-time high of 52-thousand licenses issued in 1976, but officials say
it's a good start at reviving young people's interest in fishing - and in the environment. 
<p>
Credit goes to the Master Angler program, involving more than 300 trained adult volunteers who
help teach kids the basics of fishing, including responsible fishing conduct and love of Oregon's
outdoors.

<hr>
<h2><a name="line">State board draws tsunami 
line</a></h2>
<p>
New state rules draw a line down Oregon's coast and urge coastal towns to put their hospitals,
schools and fire halls inland of that line.
<p>
The line, based on geological evidence and computer models, marks the extent to which ocean
waves and flooding are expected in the event of a catastrophic tsunami, or tidal wave.
<p>
Scientists say Oregon is vulnerable to such waves because of seismic instability in the undersea
regions off the coast. They point especially to the Cascadia subduction zone, an off-shore zone
where many earthquakes have been recorded.
<p>
The new rules stem from a law passed by the 1995 legislature requiring coastal communities to
start planning now for earthquakes and tsunamis in the future .
<p>
A key to that planning, experts say, is for communities to think twice before building critical
facilities in places where they could get wiped out by a gigantic wave.

<h2><a name="survey">Survey: Gillnetters scorn disaster assistance 
efforts</a></h2>
<p>
State and federal efforts to help Oregon and Washington fishermen recover from the loss of salmon
are mostly too little, too late, say gillnetters who responded to a recent Oregon Sea Grant survey.
<p>
The survey, conducted as part of a larger effort to examine the social, political and economic
ramifications of the Northwest salmon crisis, contacted more than 350 gillnetters in Oregon and
Washington. 
<p>
The fishermen expressed deep frustration over the way the government has handled the salmon
crisis. 
<p>
In Oregon, where disaster relief was limited to special unemployment and job training programs,
fishermen said they would rather have had the government buy back their fishing permits. In
Washington, where a permit buy-back program was in place, gillnetters said it offered too little
money or left them with thousands of dollars worth of useless gear.
<p>
Copies of the complete survey results are available from Oregon Sea Grant at Oregon State
University.

<h2><a name="relationships">Scientists look at relationships
 between land, water, fish</a></h2>
<p>
How do geology and hydrology - the workings of land and water - affect the
survival of endangered salmon and trout?
<p>
Researchers at Oregon State University will try to answer those questions in a
new, 900-thousand-dollar study of fish habitat in the upper Columbia River basin.
<p>
More than 76 separate populations of salmon and trout are threatened with
extinction east of the Cascades. Scientists say the fishes' survival could hinge on better
understanding of the processes that shape the streams in which they live.
<p>
Little is known, for instance, about the relationship between ground-water and
streams, and how geological features might affect water quality and fish survival.
<p>
The National Science Foundation and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
are funding the three-year study, which involves scientists from OSU's Department of
Fisheries and Wildlife and College of Forestry, as well as the University of Oregon.

<h2><a name="sealions">Sea lions showing less DDT</a></h2>
<p>Time and toxic-waste laws have done an amazing clean-up job on one community
of Pacific Ocean creatures threatened by pollution.
<p>
Scientists say sea lions off the California coast are carrying only a fraction as
much toxic DDT in their blubber as their forebears did 25 years ago.

<p>In 1970, some California sea lions were found to have extremely high levels of the
pesticide in their tissue - as much as 760 parts per million, amounting to a quarter-pound
of DDT per animal.
<p>
Scientists blamed the problem on massive DDT dumping off Southern California.
Starting in 1949, a single company flushed thousands of tons of the pesticide into the sea
near California's Channel Islands until dumping was halted in 1970.
<p>
Bans on open-sea dumping seem to have paid off. Sea lions tested in 1992 carried
less than 1 percent as much DDT in their bodies as the earlier test group two-and-a-half
decades ago.

<h2><a name="volcano">Seafloor observatories to monitor 
volcanoes</a></h2>
<p>
Two deep underwater sites off the Pacific Northwest coast are about to become the
most intensely monitored pieces of sea-floor real estate on the planet.
<p> 
Scientists from several North American institutions are joining forces to establish
what amount to virtual observatories to watch and monitor sea floor volcanoes and other
undersea activities.
<p>
The observatories won't be actual buildings, or even ships. Instead, they will
consist of networks of high-tech monitors and instruments placed on the sea floor to
collect information and relay it back to scientists on dry land.
<p>
By working together - and with help from the National Science Foundation -
researchers hope to learn more about undersea geology, deep-sea life forms and maybe
even something about the origins of life itself.
<p>
The two sites both sit on the Juan de Fuca ridge, west of Everett and Newport,
Oregon.

<hr>
<h2><a name="haccp">New regulations aim for safer
seafood</a></h2>
<p>New federal seafood safety regulations are aimed at catching potential health
hazards before they have a chance to make consumers sick.
<p>
The Clinton administration announced the new rules last month, but they've been
under development for several years, and should come as no news to the Oregon seafood
industry.
<p>
Known as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point, the new system replaces
one that goes back to the turn of the century. Under the old way of doing things, safety
problems weren't addressed until after someone got sick from eating tainted or badly
stored seafood.
<p>
The new system, by contrast, requires processors to keep a sharp eye out for
hazards at every step along the line. When problems are found, the industry will have to
come up with plans to solve them - and keep detailed records of what they have done.

<h2><a name="whale">Here come the whales - and the whale watchers</a></h2>
<p>
     Oregon State Parks officials expect up to 350 volunteers to brave the wind
and rain this month to help coastal visitors look for whales.
<p>     The whales - gray whales, in particular - pass by the Oregon coast each
winter on their way south to Baja California, where they rest, feed and bear their
young.
<p>     The migration has become a huge tourist draw along the coast, thanks in
part to the whale watching program. Launched by Oregon Sea Grant and now run
by
state Parks, the program trains volunteers to help people spot whales - and to
teach them
a few things about the animals and their behavior.
<p>     They'll learn, for instance, that the average adult gray whale is about the
size of a Greyhound bus, and that whales feed on tiny, shrimp-like creatures
sucked up
off the bottom of the sea floor.
<p>     Volunteers will put that information to work during Whale Watch Week,
December 26 through Jan. 2, when they staff nearly 30 whale-watch sites along
the
Oregon Coast.

<h2><a name="screen">Pump screen program helps save fish</a></h2>
<p>     The Columbia Basin Salmon Enforcement Team is praising a program that
encourages farmers to maintain and repair the screens on their streamside
irrigation
pumps.
<p>     When screens are missing or in poor repair, irrigation pumps can suck up
hundreds of young, migrating salmon along with the water destined for farm
fields.
<p>Repairing or replacing screens, the salmon team says, is one simple and
cost-effective way
to help save endangered fish.
<p>     This year, the Oregon State Police sent divers down to inspect Columbia
River irrigation intakes, and then notified farmers about missing or broken
screens. The
result: Almost every farmer contacted corrected the problem.
<p>     The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has money to help farmers
along the state's salmon-producing waterways buy, install and repair diversion
pump
screens. For information about that program, property owners can contact local
ODFW
field staff.

<h2><a name="map">New maps reveal stunning detail of ocean floor</a></h2>

<p>     For years, science has known more about the landscapes of Venus and Mars
than about our own ocean floor. But all that is changing, thanks to a stunning
new set of
maps by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
<p>     Until now, most sea floor maps were drawn from acoustic soundings taken
from ships. But that's a time-consuming method, and resulted in charts for only a
fraction
of the ocean floor. In some remote areas, charts had gaps as big as the state of
Kansas.
<p>     Now, using declassified Navy satellite technology, NOAA marine geologists
have generated sea-floor maps that would have taken them more than a century
to
complete by ship.
<p>     The new maps show vivid details which scientists hope to use in mineral
exploration and the study of climate change.
<p>     NOAA is making the new maps widely available to scientists and the
public, both on paper and via the global Internet.

<h2><a name="nrc">National Research Council: Salmon survival depends on diversity</a></h2>
<p>     A new National Research Council report says that the long-term survival of
Pacific Northwest salmon depends on diversity of stock - and diversity of
approaches to
saving the fish.
<p>     The report, made public last month, follows two years of scientific inquiry
into the state of the salmon and efforts to save wild stocks from extinction.
     In general, the report concludes, long-term salmon survival hinges on two
goals.
<p>     First, the fish require a rich and diverse gene pool. That means protecting
many different stocks of salmon, and not just relying on hatcheries and their
relatively
small genetic base.
<p>     Second, the report says, salmon need to be protected watershed by
watershed - and that means using different strategies and approaches that take
into
account each area's ecological and human needs.

<h2><a href="#boater">Recreational boaters: Watch out for the other guy</a></h2>
<p>     High waves, hidden rocks, bad weather - these can all pose dangers for the
recreational boater. But the biggest threat of all - at least in terms of sheer
numbers of
boating accidents - may come from other boaters.
<p>     Of nearly 10,000 boating accidents reported in U.S. waters last year, the
Coast Guard says more than half involved two or more vessels running into each
other
<p>     Granted, those weren't the deadliest accidents. Coast Guard figures say
more people died when their boats capsized, or by falling overboard. But
boat-to-boat
collisions can be costly, both in human and financial terms.
<p>     Part of the problem, the Coast Guard says, is that too many people think
operating a pleasure boat is just like driving a car.
<p>     The key to avoiding collisions, boating safety experts say, is keeping a clear
view in front and on all sides of your vessel, knowing how your boat handles and
staying
alert to what's going on around you.

<h2><a name="streams">Cooperation helps clean up Tillamook streams</a></h2>
<p>
     A new Oregon State University report indicates that more than a decade of
cooperation between the government and dairy farmers has shown promise toward
cleaning up pollution in Tillamook Bay.
<p>     For years, runoff from dairy farms has been blamed for rising levels of
undesirable bacteria in the streams that flow into the bay. The bacteria, which
come from
cow manure, pollute the waters and threaten the bay's once-prosperous oyster
industry.
<p>     In 1980, government agents launched a Rural Clean Water Program which
worked with farmers to seek solutions to the runoff problem. Over the next 10
years,
farmers and the government worked together to build manure storage facilities
and
monitor changes in water quality.
<p>     Ron Miner, an OSU Extension water quality specialist, recently finished
analyzing the monitoring data from that project. Miner says that although broad
conclusions are difficult to draw, it's clear that bacteria counts dropped sharply on
streams where manure storage and pumping systems were installed.

<h2><a name="watch"> </a></h2>
<p>     Mile by mile, Oregon's coast is under the watchful gaze of an army of
citizen conservationists.
<p>     They call their effort Coast Watch and their goal is to observe
environmental change, and how people use, and abuse, the state's 362 miles of
coastline.
<p>     Working under the umbrella of the nonprofit Oregon Shores Conservation
Coalition, the project divides the coast into 340 segments and recruits volunteers
to adopt
each stretch for a year or more. Watchers agree to visit their site at least four
times a
year, record environmental changes and take part in occasional studies, such as a
recent
survey of seabird populations.
<p>     Although some participants come from inland environmental groups, others
live and work on the coast. One woman, who adopted a mile-long beach
overlooked by her
parents' home, says she feels like she's continuing a family tradition of
stewardship.

<h2><a name="basket">Ancient baskets help date coastal Indian culture</a></h2>
<p>
     Fragments of an ancient basket found in a California island cave indicate
that Pacific Coast Indians may have had more sophisticated cultures than many
people
had thought.
<p>     The fragments, unearthed on Channel Island off Santa Barbara, are
between 86-hundred and 9-thousand years old, according to scientists at the
University of
Oregon.
<p>     Archaeologists say that's twice the age of the oldest similar artifacts
discovered elsewhere along the Pacific coast. 
<p>     Woven items such as baskets are considered one marker of a native people's
technological sophistication. Inland, in the dry desert country of the West, woven
items
have been dated back as far as 11-thousand years.
<p>     Some have speculated that coastal Indians had simple cultures because so
few of their artifacts have been found. But other scientists suspect that more
advanced
items made from plant or wood fibers may have simply fallen to decay in the
moist Pacific
coast climate.

<h2><a name="refuge">National Wildlife Refuges celebrate their week </a></h2>
<p>     The week of October 8th is National Wildlife Refuges Week, and several of
Oregon's 19 refuges are planning to celebrate.
<p>     Formal classes and tours are planned at the Umatilla National Wildlife
Refuge on the Columbia River, and at Hart Mountain Refuge in Eastern Oregon.
<p>     But other refuges - including several on the coast - will also be open for
self-guided tours and wildlife-watching.
<p>     Among them are Three Arch Rocks and Cape Mears, the oldest national
wildlife refuges west of the Mississippi, where visitors can see nesting seabirds
and other
aquatic life. 
<p>     President Theodore Roosevelt established the first National Wildlife Refuge
in 1903, on Florida's Pelican Island, to protect colonial nesting birds threatened
with
slaughter by market hunters. 
<p>     Today the United States has more than 500 wildlife refuges covering 92
million acres.

<h2><a name="earthnsea">Back to school with Earth and Sea Investigators</a></h2>
<p>     Children as far away as Eastern Oregon are getting a chance to explore the
ocean this fall, thanks to an OSU educator's popular Earth and Sea Investigators
course.
<p>     More than 89 schools in 57 Oregon school districts take part in the course,
which is beamed to them via satellite from the Hatfield Marine Science Center in
Newport.
<p>     In their classrooms miles from the Pacific, students watch the hour-long
classes on TV and then do projects that relate to their themes. This season's
themes
include undersea landscapes, coastal history and salmon.
<p>     Now in its third season, Earth and Sea Investigators is the brainchild of
Kathleen Heide, who used to direct the visitors wing at the Marine Science
Center. 
<p>     The program has support from the Oregon Department of Education, NASA
and Tektronix, as well as the Native Americans in Marine Science Program.

<h2><a name="temperature">New technology monitors river temperature</a></h2>
<p>     A high-tech camera, a helicopter and some tiny, heat-sensitive tags are
telling Oregon State University scientists a lot about how spring chinook salmon
spend
their summers.
<p>     The chinook spend their winters in the Pacific, and each spring make the
long migration to Eastern Oregon's John Day River. They stay in the river until
fall,
when they spawn and die.
<p>     Scientists know the fish do best in cool water. But along some stretches of
the John Day, grazing and logging have removed the trees and brush that used to
shade
the water from the summer sun.
<p>     A team of scientists from OSU's Cooperative Fishery Research Unit spent
last summer monitoring specially tagged fish with an air-borne infra-red camera.
Not
only did the camera pinpoint the fish, but it showed the water temperature where
they
congregated.
<p>     The researchers say the resulting maps graphically illustrate the
importance of logging and ranching practices that leave vegetation along the river
banks
to protect the fish.

<h2><a name="columbia">Can the Columbia be saved?</a></h2>
<p>     Fishermen, conservationists, scientists and policy makers will gather in

<p>     The river in question is the Columbia, and the conference will give people a
chance to learn about the many problems, human and environmental, that beset
the
waterway.
<p>     The conference will look at how commerce, industry, recreation and power
needs have shaped - and in some cases, damaged - the Northwest's mightiest
river.
<p>     Participants include historians, Native Americans, foresters and spokesmen
for the Army Corps of Engineers. Governor John Kitzhaber is expected to attend,
as are

<h2><a name="allocate">Salmon: Allocation is as important as conservation</a></h2>
<p>
An Oregon State University researcher says the northwest salmon crisis is as
much a problem of too many fishermen as too few fish.
<p>Anthropologist Court Smith will make that point when he joins other scientists
from across the country in Washington, D.C. this month for a national forum
called "Can
America Save its Fisheries?"
<p>Smith says resource allocation may be as important as conservation in addressing
the scarcity of salmon and other fish.
Allocation isn't just a question of who gets to fish and how much they can catch,
says Smith. It's also a matter of determining what role we want fisheries to play
in our
society.
<p>Smith is among more than two dozen scientists and policy makers who will take
part in the September 11 forum at the National Press Club. The event is being
organized
by the National Sea Grant College Program, of which Oregon Sea Grant is a
member.

<h2><a name="beachban">Beaches: Ban the vehicles?</a></h2>
<p>Fifty years ago, automobiles were a common sight on Oregon's sandy beaches.
<p>Today, cars are allowed on only a handful of beaches - and even that may soon be
a thing
of the past.
<p>The state Parks and Recreation Commission is holding hearings this month on
requests to ban or sharply limit vehicle traffic on 25 miles of Southern Oregon
beach.
<p>Several of the requests have to do with protecting the western snowy plover, a
threatened shorebird that builds its nests among the dunes.
<p>But those who manage coastal beaches say they are also seeing more conflicts
between people who like to drive on the sand and those who prefer to enjoy the
beaches
on foot.
<p>Surfers, windsurfers and people who fish in the surf oppose the closure plans,
saying they need cars and trucks to haul their gear to the shore.
<p>The closure requests came from private citizens, the U.S. Forest Service and the
Bureau of Land Management. The Parks Commission plans to make a ruling
sometime
this fall.

<hr>
<h2><a name="rogue">Chinook thriving on the Rogue</a></h2>
<p>Salmon and steelhead may be few and far between in many Oregon waters - but
not on Southern Oregon's Rogue River.
<p>From last year's fall chinook season, to a spring chinook run nearly twice its
normal size, sport fishing on the Rogue has been great. So great, in fact, that
some
skeptics are wondering where the salmon crisis is.
<p>But wildlife biologists say the Rogue, and the fish that run its waters, have two
big advantages that set them apart from other Northwest rivers and their
salmonid
stocks.
<p>For one thing, young salmon that leave the Rogue turn south, heading for feeding
grounds which have seen several productive years.
<p>Meanwhile, ocean harvest of chinook has been curtailed to protect depressed
stocks
from the Klamath River. And since the Rogue and Klamath salmon swim the
same ocean
waters, what protects one run, protects the other.
<p>Biologists say it goes to show that many factors influence the survival of the
salmon from river to river and year to year.

<h2><a name="fees">Fees in store for Dunes, Yaquina head?</a></h2>
<p>
Visitors to two of Oregon's most popular coastal recreation areas could be paying
fees to enjoy their favorite spots starting next spring.
<p>Both houses of Congress have given tentative approval to a bill that would set up
a pilot user fee program for natural and scenic areas across the country.
Likely candidates for the fee program are the Oregon Dunes National Recreation
Area south of Florence, and the Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area north of
Newport.
<p>Those who manage the scenic areas say collecting the fees might be a hassle, but
that the money is needed, especially when Congress is giving them less money to
serve
bigger crowds.
<p>The dunes, for instance, got about one-and-a-half million visitors last year, and
the
number is rising by about 10 percent each year. Yet the scenic area's budget for
serving
those visitors took a 20 percent cut this year.

<h2><a name="coho">Coho: Next on the Endangered Species list?</a></h2>
<p>     Last month's announcement that wild coastal coho might be listed as a
threatened species came as no surprise to those who have watched the fish decline
over
the past 20 years.
<p>     Once the region's most abundant salmon species, coho used to be caught by
the millions each season. Last summer, their numbers had fallen so low that there
was no
coho season at all.
<p>     Hearings over the coming year will determine whether the fish come under
Endangered Species Act protection. If they do, the listing could have broader
implications
than any to date.
<p>     Coho range over a vast region, from California to Canada and stretching as
far as 120 miles inland.
<p>     As much as half of that habitat is privately owned. Land-owners - including
large timber operations that have been blamed for habitat degradation - will have
to play
a key role if the species is to be restored to its historic numbers.

<hr><h2><a name="clams">Clams: Second product for salmon ranchers?</a></h2>
<p>     An Oregon State University researcher says salmon ranchers could reduce
pollution - and increase profits - by growing clams in the same ponds and pens
where
they rear fish.
<p>     Aquaculturists have long struggled with the problem of cleaning up water
that becomes fouled by uneaten fish food and wastes. Some have proposed growing
seaweed alongside the fish, to clean the water by absorbing excess nutrients.
<p>     Graduate researcher Reza Moosapanah thought it might be possible to grow
a second food crop - clams - in the water that had been cleansed by the seaweed.
<p>     It turns out, though, that fish farmers may be able to skip the seaweed
entirely. The researcher says clams themselves do a good job of consuming
nutrients the

<h2><a name="horses">Big horses join in restoration efforts</a></h2>
<p>     A team of big horses is lending a hand - or should that be a hoof - to one
coastal land-owner's efforts to restore degraded salmon streams.
<P>     The team - a pair of sturdy Percherons - spent two weeks in July dragging
logs, large and small, into sections of the north and south forks of the Yachats
River. 
<p>     The logs will help slow the water and form cool, sheltered pools to protect
young salmon from predators. Over time, the logs should also trap gravel where
future
generations of fish can spawn.
<p>     Those who organized the project opted to use horses instead of heavy
machinery in hopes that the animals would do less damage to the already
degraded river
bank.
<p>     The property owner was joined in the project by the Oregon Department of
Fish and Wildlife and an out-of-work salmon fisherman hired under the federal
Salmon
Disaster Outreach program.

<h2><a name="grants">Sea Grant announces 1995-96 grants</a></h2>
<p> Oregon Sea Grant will distribute nearly 3-million-dollars in federal
research money to scientists studying ocean and coastal resources in the coming
year.
<p>     The money goes to projects ranging from an in-depth look at the region's
fishing communities, to basic research into new medicines that might be extracted
from
seaweed.
<p>     The grants are part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration budget for 29 Sea Grant programs in colleges and universities
nationwide.
<p>     Oregon's share includes money to continue ground-breaking research in
fisheries, seafood science, coastal hazards and other fields.
<p>     One unusual project will bring together seven research and outreach teams
to look deeply into the human side of Oregon's fishing economy. That group will
examine
how regions, communities, businesses and families are adapting to industry
change
brought on by the salmon crisis and other factors.

<h2><a name="tag">Turn in a tag, win a prize</a></h2>
<p>
Researchers from the University of Washington are asking commercial and sports
fishermen to keep an eye out for salmon with small, colored disks attached to
their dorsal
fins.
<p>They're even offering prizes to get people to cooperate.
The tags are part of a three-nation study to find out more about how  salmon
develop during the critical years they spend on the high seas. The white, red and
orange
tags may carry writing in English, Russian or Japanese.
<p>People who return the disks - or even a description of the disk and the
information
on it - can get a free fishing cap. Additional prizes will go to anyone willing to
hand over
a whole, tagged fish.
<p>Information about how and where to send recovered tags has been distributed to
commercial and sport fishing businesses up and down the coast. Or, you can
contact the
High Seas Project at the University of Washington's Fisheries Research Institute
in
Seattle.

<h2><a name="air">Salmon spotters take to the air</a></h2>
<p>
Water intakes along the Columbia basin can be deadly to young salmon, which
can
get sucked inside and killed as they try to migrate down streams and rivers
toward the
sea.
<p>
States along the Columbia require land-owners to screen their water intakes to
protect the fish. But with hundreds of intakes strung along hundreds of miles of
river, it's
hard to make sure those screens are in place.
<p>Oregon fish and wildlife officers are solving that problem with a few airplanes -
and a little high-tech magic.
<p>The officers use state police airplanes to fly a grid pattern over critical salmon
habitats, looking for raised or missing diversion screens. 
<p>When they spot one, they use the satellite-based Global Positioning System to
pinpoint its location within a few yards. 
Then they radio that information to officers on the ground, who can contact
property owners and get the problem resolved.

<h2><a name="floor">Exploring the sea floor - by video</a></h2>
<p>It's one thing to hear or read about the bottom of the sea, with its hidden
mountains, valleys and seismic faults. But how many people ever get to see such
wonders?
<p>Now almost anyone can, without even getting wet.
<p>A new Oregon State University video lets viewers "fly" over the bottom of the sea,
exploring the ridges and wrinkles of the area called the Cascadia subduction zone.
<p>The 20-minute video combines real footage shot from submarines with
sophisticated computer imaging to give the viewer a sense of soaring over the
ocean floor.
<p>OSU geologists produced the video to help researchers and lay people alike
understand more about how the sea-floor looks, and the geologic forces that give it
its
shape.
<p>The video will soon be available in VHS to teachers and others interested in
marine education. For more information, contact the OSU Department of Oceanic
and
Atmospheric Sciences.

<h2><a name="pools">Tide pools: Look, don't touch</a></h2>
<p>
Oregon's rocky coastline is home to countless living things, and none are more
fascinating than the colorful plants and animals that populate coastal tide pools.
<p>When the tide goes out, they don't look like much: A bit of furry green slime, or a
shell, tightly shut. But when the tide returns, tide pool life unfolds like a hidden
garden,
rich with color and diversity.
<p>Many tide pools are also easy to get to, offering coastal visitors a rare chance to
get a close look at the creatures they contain.
<p>But the very act of admiring tide pools can mean destruction for the fragile
ecosystems they contain. That's why it's a bad idea - and even against the law - to
dig,
poke or take away the creatures that call the tide pools home.
<p>For more information about tide pools, and how to explore them without doing
them harm, check in at any one of the many State Parks offices along the Oregon
Coast.

<h2><a name="salmon">Salmon: Setting priorities for restoration</a></h2>
<p>     Northwest watershed managers must be feeling a little
like Solomon these days. Faced with a region-wide salmon crisis,
and armed with only a limited pot of money, how do they decide
which part of the problem to tackle first?
<p>     A new handbook offers a science-based approach to
identifying which rivers and streams stand the best chance of
restoration success.
<p>     The idea, according to the working group that put the
book together, is to look at entire ecosystems, not just fish.
<p>     The system would give the highest restoration priority
to relatively healthy watersheds where native salmon are still
known to spawn.
<p>     The handbook came out of a group of agency, science,
fisheries and conservation experts sponsored by state Senator
Bill Bradbury. A review draft is being circulated this month, and
a final copy is expected out this summer.

<h2><a name="earthday">Earth Day: Family fun at Marine Science Center</a></h2>
<p>     Saturday, April 22nd marks the 25th anniversary of
Earth Day, and Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science
Center is joining the party.
<p>     The center is inviting kids to bring their parents and
enjoy a full day of free, family science activities designed to
celebrate the marine environment.
<p>     Families can sign up in advance to visit the sea water
labs, where they'll get to work on marine biology projects
involving  sea stars, urchins, plankton and other marine
creatures.
<p>     Or they can take in a skit by the center's popular
marine theater team, Mr. and Mrs. Fish - or see a film about the
environment and population growth.
<p>     Earth Day activities will run from 10 in the morning to
4 in the afternoon on Saturday, the 22nd. For more information
about these and other activities, call the Hatfield Marine
Science Center in Newport at 867-0100.

<h2><a name="workshops">Fishing families: Helping each other help themselves</a></h2>
<p>     Fishing families up and down the Oregon Coast are
working together to take control of their futures in a business
where the future can be unpredictable, at best.
<p>     Even in the best of times, fishermen may spend days or
even months away from home. Their families back on shore worry -
about the weather, the catch and how to pay the bills.
<p>     Oregon Sea Grant's Fishing Dependent Families project
is working to relieve some of that pressure through education.   
Coastal residents and community groups - including fishermen's
wives - identify issues they'd like to learn more about. Then the
project sets up workshops to address those topics, from managing
conflict to handling family finance.
<p>     For more information about fishing family workshops
scheduled this spring, contact local offices of the OSU Extension
Service in Newport, Coos Bay, Astoria, Tillamook or Gold Beach.

<h2><a name="bpa">Congress: Sell the BPA?</a></h2>
<p>    Residents of the Northwest think of the Bonneville
Power Administration as a source of cheap power - and recently,
as a key player in the effort to restore dwindling salmon stocks.
<p>     But back in Washington, D.C., many see the BPA as a New
Deal-era white elephant which contributes to the federal deficit.
<p>     Led by budget-cutting Republicans, some in Congress are
talking about privatizing the BPA. At the very least, critics
say, the agency should be forced into a more market-driven
relationship with its wholesale power customers.
<p>     More than a dozen proposals to restructure the BPA have
surfaced before Congress. They range from plans to sell the
agency outright, to capping its liability for salmon recovery
costs. 
<p>     Few in Congress expect much legislation to pass this
year - but observers predict the BPA will look much different
within the next few years. What that could mean to ratepayers -
and to Northwest salmon - is anybody's guess.

<h2><a name="bills">Tsunami Bills Move Through 
Legislature</a></h2>                         TIME: :57
<p>     Oregon lawmakers are looking at two bills that would
require coastal communities to do a better job of preparing for
earthquakes and tidal waves.
<p>     Senate Bill 378 would require coastal schools to hold
periodic earthquake and tsunami drills. Under the bill, schools
would have to come up with plans for swiftly evacuating students
in the event of an earthquake or a tsunami warning.
<p>     Senate Bill 379 prevents communities from placing such
"critical facilities" as new hospitals and fire stations on sites
likely to be flooded if a tidal wave occurs.
<p>     Some coastal towns lie so close to sea level that their
leaders fear the bill would prevent them from building such
facilities. The bill's sponsors have promised to amend the
measure to allow such communities to seek exemption from the law.
<p>     Both bills grew out of a two-year study of coastal
natural hazards by a public-private panel under the sponsorship
of Oregon Sea Grant.

<h2><a name="whale">Whale Watch Week: March 18-25</a></h2>
<p>
     What's as big as a bus, yet dines on delicacies so
small they can barely be seen? What breathes air, yet lives most
of its life beneath the sea? What has fins and flukes, yet bears
live young and nurses them on mothers' milk?
<p>    The gray whale, of course - and this is a good month to
see them in action. The huge mammals are making their annual
migration north, from Baja California to Alaska's Bering Sea.
<p>     March 18th through 25th has been designated Spring
Whale Watch Week, when trained volunteers will be stationed at
favorite coastal viewpoints to tell visitors all about the
whales.
<p>     Many of those volunteers will be using a one-page fact
sheet called, simply, "Gray Whales." Developed by Oregon Sea
Grant marine mammal specialist Bruce Mate, the handout describes
the whales' breeding, feeding and migration habits.
<p>     Copies of the publication - and tips on where to look
for whales - are available at the Alsea Bay Bridge Interpretive
Center in Waldport.

<h2><a name="esa">Fishing Federation: Save Endangered Species Act</a></h2>
<p>
     Some people charge that the Endangered Species Act
favors wildlife over business and jobs. But West Coast fishing
businesses say the Act may be the only thing that's keeping their
jobs afloat.
<p>     A coalition of commercial and sport fishing interests
is urging Congress to reject bills that would suspend the act's
enforcement and take away its federal funds.
<p>     The Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's
Associations says such action could bring West Coast salmon
recovery efforts to an immediate, grinding halt.
<p>     The Federation, which represents commercial fishing
interests from California to Alaska, is joined in its appeal by
the Northwest Sportfishing Industry Association.
<p>     Both groups argue that, without the Endangered Species
Act to spur recovery, there is little hope of ever reversing
salmon declines. And without the salmon, they say, it will be
fishermen and their families who find their livelihoods
endangered.

<p>     Ten public and private organizations are banding
together to build a new seafood research and business complex in
Astoria, and Oregon State University is part of the team.
<p>     OSU broke ground last month for its part of the
complex: a new, 4-million-dollar seafood laboratory to replace
its existing Astoria lab.
<p>     The new lab will give Astoria - and the entire coast -
a state-of-the-art facility for research into seafood processing,
products, biochemistry and waste reduction.
<p>     OSU's Astoria lab has already won renown for helping
industry develop new consumer products from Pacific whiting.
<p>     Funding for the new lab comes from the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, the Oregon Department of Economic Development,
the city of Astoria and OSU.
<p>     Scheduled to open in the spring of 1996, the lab will
form the hub of a major conference and hotel complex being
developed with public and private funds.

<h2><a name="esa">Endangered Species Act comments due</a></h2>
<p>
     The public has until February 21st to comment on new
guidelines governing how two federal agencies administer
provisions of the Endangered Species Act.
<p>     The guidelines would apply to the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service.
<p>     Among other things, the guidelines more clearly define
which species are covered by the act, and who may petition to
list, delist or reclassify a species. They also limit the time
the agencies have to respond to such requests.
<p>     In addition, the guidelines lay out strategies for
trying to keep species from dying out while their status is under
review.
<p>     Copies of the proposed guidelines were published in the
December 21st edition of the Federal Register. They are also
available from regional offices of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.

<hr>
<h2><a name="issues">Resource issues and the new Northwest delegation</a></h2><p>
     Although resource issues remain high on the agenda of
the Northwest's Congressional delegation, the changing party
power balance could also change how those issues get addressed.
<p>     Republican Party leaders have announced plans to change
- or  dismantle - many of the laws originally intended to protect
the nation's air, land and water.
<p>     High on the GOP hit list is the 21-year-old Endangered
Species Act, up for reauthorization this year. Critics blame the
act for many of the economic woes that beset the Pacific
Northwest. 
<p>     The region's Republican delegates say they will push
for changes to require the government to consider economic, as
well as environmental impacts before listing a plant or animal as
endangered.
<p>     Other proposals advanced in the first month of the new
Congress call for selling off the Bonneville Power
Administration, backing off salmon protection efforts and
exempting some Northwest timber sales from environmental laws.

<h2><a name="meal">Fish Meal boosts cow milk production</a></h2>
<p>    Midwest dairy cows may soon be dining on Northwest
seafood if farmers pay heed to a recent Oregon State University
study.
<p>     The "seafood" comes in the form of fish meal, which
researchers added to cattle feed to see how it compared with
other protein supplements used to boost early milk production.
<p>     As it turns out, OSU researchers say, fish meal is a
good, cost-effective alternative to bone meal, soybean meal,
blood meal and other common protein supplements.
<p>     The fish meal contains high-quality protein that
doesn't break down in the cow's complex digestive system. The
extra protein helps boost the animals' milk production,
particularly in the first several weeks after lactation.
<p>     The researchers were quick to add that the fish meal
does  not pass on its flavor to the milk.
<p>     The study could be good news for Oregon's seafood
processors, always on the lookout for ways to capitalize on
byproducts which otherwise would go to waste.

<hr><h2><a name="duckies">Rubber duckies help map ocean flow</a></h2>
<p>
     Thousands of yellow plastic ducks - and turtles and
frogs, too - are helping scientists learn more about the Pacific
Ocean and its currents.
<p>     Two years ago, a freighter crossing the Pacific ran
into stormy weather near the International Dateline. High seas
washed several cargo containers overboard - including one loaded
with nearly 29,000 plastic bathtub toys.
<p>     About 10 months later, the first toys started washing
up on shore near Sitka, Alaska - nearly 5,000 miles away.
<p>     Researchers for the National Marine Fisheries Service
say the accidental spill - like an earlier one involving athletic
shoes - was a windfall for science.
<p>     By using computers to plot sightings of the toys - at
sea, and when they wash to shore - scientists are learning
information that could benefit fishing fleets, navigators and
weather forecasters world-wide.

<h2><a name="whales">Whales return to Oregon coastal waters</a></h2>
<p>
The great gray whales are once again making their northward
migration through Oregon's off-shore waters on the way to their
summer feeding grounds off Alaska.
<p>
This year, the whales brought a reminder that they - like
other marine mammals - are protected by the law.
<p>Last month, a Lincoln County man found a dead baby whale
washed up on the beach. Unable to contact anyone who could tell
him what to do, he took the carcass home.
<p>Eventually, he contacted OSU's Hatfield Marine Science
Center. Marine mammal specialist Bruce Mate arranged to have the
carcass picked up so scientists could try to find out why the
animal died.
<p>Mate reminds people that the Marine Mammal Protection Act
prohibits anyone from disturbing beached whales, dead or alive,
even if the animal seems to need help.
<p>Instead, you should contact the closest Oregon State Police
post and ask for their special marine mammal hotline number so
you can make a report.

<hr><h2><a name="families">Helping fishing families help themselves</a></h2>
<p>Declining stocks of salmon and other species, increased
competition, regulatory changes - it can all add up to hard times
for Oregon's coastal fishermen and their families.
<p>Oregon Sea Grant's Fishing Dependent Families Project is
trying to help fishing families learn more about how to help
themselves.
<p>The project is community-based, with volunteer leaders in
towns up and down the coast. By talking with their neighbors,
these volunteers help determine how OSU and other educational
resources can best serve the local fishing community's needs.
<p>In one town, fishing wives asked for a workshop on coping
with the anger that can come with change. In another, the project
brought in financial experts to talk about family and business
money management.
<p>To find out more about the Fishing Dependent Families
Project, contact your local county office of the OSU Extension
Service.

<h2><a name="hazards">Coast ill-prepared for natural hazard, group says</a></h2>
<p>
Much of Oregon's coast is ill-prepared to deal with natural
hazards, from month-to-month erosion to once-in-a-lifetime
earthquakes.
<p>That's the conclusion of a 20-member panel that spent the
last two years studying coastal natural hazards and the systems
set up to deal with them.
<p>In many cases, the group concluded, these systems fail to
address real threats to life and property from erosion,
earthquakes, tidal waves and other natural events.
<p>The group, which included private citizens, scientists and
public officials, recently issued 79 separate recommendations for
changing public policy to address those threats.
<p>Several of the recommendations - including changes in
emergency planning and land-use regulation - are already making
their way toward the Legislature.
<p>Copies of the complete report are available for $12 through
the Oregon Sea Grant office at Oregon State University.

<hr>
<h2><a name="bills">Agency pursues tsunami preparedness bills</a></h2>
Remember last year's tsunami alert on the Oregon coast? Some
saw it as a natural test of the emergency planning systems in
communities up and down the coast. And although the predicted
tidal wave never came, a wave of criticism did.
<p>In some places, the emergency warning system just didn't
work. In others, the tsunami warning actually attracted people to
the coast.
<p>As part of a package of recommendations for improving
coastal disaster planning, the Oregon Legislature is about to get
two bills aimed at increasing tsunami awareness.
<p>The measures would require school districts, in particular, 
to hold regular tsunami drills to make sure students and teachers
can react without confusion or panic.
<p>Another measure would prevent schools, hospitals and other
key public facilities from being built in areas likely to be hard
hit by an earthquake or tsunami.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Oregon's coastal salmon restoration plan, developed at
the behest of Governor Kitzhaber, has been published in draft form and
circulated to interested parties. This issue of Restoration provides a

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H2><A NAME="Overview"></A>Overview of the Governor's Coastal Salmon Plan
</H2>

<P><I>Editor's Note: The following overview of the Oregon Coastal Salmon
Restoration Initiative (OCSRI) was extracted verbatim from the official
version published on the state of Oregon's <A HREF="http://www.das.state.or.us/salmon">World
Wide Web site.</A></I> </P>

<P>Governor John Kitzhaber announced the planning effort to conserve and
restore Oregon's coastal salmon and steelhead in October of 1995. One of
his first steps was to establish a team approach for developing an action
plan that would lead to restoring the health of coastal salmon and trout
populations. Another early step was to require directors of key state agencies
to meet with the Governor bi-weekly, reporting progress and resolving interagency
obstacles. Outreach teams were directed to work with key agency stakeholders,
ask for their advice, and present ideas for their comment. A Science Team
was established to work on technical issues. Agencies worked with NMFS
staff to develop action plans designed to address management practices
and environmental factors that were affecting salmon production. All of
this was occurring on a fast track, aiming at a mid-summer date for submitting
a draft conservation plan to NMFS. </P>

<P>It is the mission of the Oregon Salmon Restoration Initiative to restore
our coastal salmon populations and fisheries to productive and sustainable
levels which will provide substantial environmental, cultural, and economic
benefits. </P>

<P>Other significant aspects of OCSRI include the following points: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Salmon are recognized as an integral part of Oregon's cultural identity.
</LI>

<LI>The effort will serve as a model for intergovernmental and community
based collaboration and partnerships. </LI>

<LI>While OCSRI's overall intent is to address anadromous salmon, steelhead
and cutthroat trout, the greatest focus of this document is on coho salmon.
Future work will address unique needs of other species. </LI>

<LI>The effort to restore Oregon's salmon will only be successful if it
represents grassroots involvement, ownership, and commitment in a cooperative
work environment. </LI>

<LI>The OCSRI will emphasize a voluntary versus regulatory approach. Efforts
will be made to improve compliance with existing environmental protection
laws. However, the intent is to make the existing system work better, not
just establish a set of new laws. </LI>

<LI>Everyone shares responsibility for the salmon's problem. There is no
clear justification to single out parties to blame for the fact that salmon
populations in Oregon are not healthy today. Consequently, everyone needs
to share in actions that are needed to restore the health of salmon populations.
</LI>

<LI>The intent of the OCSRI is to restore native populations of salmon
and trout. The emphasis will, therefore, be on conserving and restoring
wild populations and the environments that support them. </LI>

<LI>Hatchery production has a legitimate role in natural resource management.
Some hatchery fish will continue to be produced for purposes that may include
assisting restoration of depressed wild populations or supplementing fisheries.</LI>

<LI>While wild coho populations are in the process of recovering, no directed
harvest on this species is expected. After documenting a sustained period
of recovery by coho to a predetermined level, some directed harvest of
this species in recreational and commercial fisheries (especially of hatchery
fish) is anticipated, consistent with achieving recovery of wild populations.
</LI>

<LI>The OCSRI Plan has been developed in an open environment that has actively
solicited, considered, and incorporated suggestions from all affected and
responsible parties. State agencies have outreached to stakeholders and
constituents; conservation organizations have been asked to submit recommendations;
agencies have been asked to consider recommendations in two recent scientific
analyses of the salmon crisis; NMFS staff have submitted critique of an
initial management measures package submitted by state agencies; and federal
management partners have been asked to join in the effort.</LI>

<H2>OSU <A NAME="Specialists"></A>Specialists Review the Draft</H2>

<P>Editor's Note: Oregon State University was asked by the Governor's office
to provide a scientific peer review of the governor's Oregon Coastal Salmon
Restoration Initiative (OCSRI) draft plan. We excerpt here the comments
of three OSU faculty, who provided a range of comments based on their differing
professional expertise and experience. Their comments have been copy-edited.
</P>

<P>Stan Gregory is a salmon ecologist in the Department of Fisheries and
Wildlife and the leader of the OSU Stream Team. Mike Borman is an Extension
specialist in the Department of Rangeland Resources and the OSU Extension
Service's representative to the OCSRI process. Derek Godwin has been the
Extension watershed management agent in Curry County for the past two and
a half years, working with local watershed councils, providing technical
assistance and educational outreach. </P>

<P>The reviewers' comments are their own, not any official position of
Oregon State University or its departments. </P>

<H3>Comments by Stan Gregory</H3>

<P>The Oregon Coastal Salmon Restoration Initiative presents a challenge
for Oregonians. The OCSRI is a landmark process in our state's history
of addressing natural resource issues in a coordinated multidisciplinary
approach. On the other hand, the current plan is not sufficient to eliminate
the need for listing coastal coho salmon as endangered under the Endangered
Species Act and the need for a recovery plan. The danger for Oregon is
that the public's attention will be focused on the current deficiencies
and we will lose this opportunity to build a more coordinated approach
to natural resource management. </P>

<P>The OCSRI recognizes salmon as an integral part of Oregon's cultural
identity--much more than a small collection of species or a commercial
commodity. It emphasizes wild populations and the environments that support
them. Cautious use of hatcheries is an important principle that must be
remembered as the plan is put into practice. Under the OCSRI, directed
commercial harvest of coho salmon under this period of severe decline would
not be allowed. If coho recover, it also will be important to exercise
greater caution in setting future harvest goals and practices than we have
demonstrated in the past. </P>

<H4>Effective Implementation Needed </H4>

<P>Effective implementation of existing regulations and agency programs
is one of the most important and most challenging elements of the plan.
We must ask several questions about actions proposed in the plan: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Does the action make a difference on the ground, in the stream, or
to the fish? </LI>

<LI>Is the action a change from the practices and policies that we have
been using in our past efforts to protect the coastal salmon? </LI>

<LI>Are there explicit guarantees that the action will be taken? </LI>

<LI>Has the state or federal government demonstrated willingness to commit
people and financial resources to implement the action? </LI>
</UL>

<P>The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and Oregon Department of
Forestry considered these questions seriously, and they offered new actions.
Though improvements are needed in both of these agencies' responses, they
put actions on the table that were not available before this plan. </P>

<P>Management measures proposed by some other state agencies create doubts
that their proposed measures would help salmon much. Actions proposed by
these agencies, especially the Oregon Department of Agriculture, are brief
listings of current programs and are not substantially different than their
past actions. The importance of floodplains, coastal lowlands, and estuaries
in the life history of coho salmon and other salmonids calls attention
to the role of agriculture in the recovery of coastal salmon. ODA's proposed
actions fall far short of the potential steps that would benefit salmon.
</P>

<P>The OCSRI emphasizes a voluntary versus regulatory approach. This is
positive in the sense that it recognizes that the decline of salmon has
been caused by all of our social actions and will require a broad-based
social commitment to reverse the decline. It is potentially weak because
we have no strong evidence that voluntary programs have made major changes
in Oregon's environment. Conversely, there are several examples where regulatory
approaches caused environmental improvement. Accelerated actions on both
fronts--volunteerism and regulation--are needed if the OCSRI is going to
be successful. </P>

<P>Despite the limitations of OCSRI, by undertaking the plan Oregon has
made a major advance in its ability to respond to regional resource needs.
We will all be served if our concerns with the OCSRI can be focused toward
developing an effective course of action. We can use this first draft as
a framework for constructively addressing the future of coastal salmon
in our state. </P>

<H3>Comments by Mike Borman </H3>

<H4>Appraisal of the Plan </H4>

<P>The stated premise of the OCSRI is that limiting factors will be identified
in a basin context and that solutions to addressing those limiting factors
will be implemented through a watershed council context involving all management
entities and stakeholders. This is an appropriate premise and is facilitated
through the OCSRI process. It will be much more difficult to achieve positive
results through an ESA listing, which probably will not facilitate private
landowner participation. </P>

<P>Because of the land ownership patterns in the range of coho, private
landowner participation has been identified as essential to the success
of reversing the apparent decline of coho. If carefully administered and
managed on an adaptive basis, the OCSRI proposed plan is likely to elicit
buy-in and collaboration by stakeholders, including small-scale landowners.
This proposed plan is much more likely to result in a long-term positive
trend for coho than the top-down regulatory approach that an ESA listing
will generate. The OCSRI plan should not be expected to provide significant
benefits in the short term. Results will occur based on a quality education
and outreach program and an adequate incentive program. People need to
understand the fish requirements, what habitat needs are, and how to provide
them, and they require the resources to help make the necessary improvements.
</P>

<P>The continued cooperation among the state agencies is essential to show
Oregon's citizens that this is an important enough initiative that the
agencies are being forced to overcome natural bureaucratic turf protection
tendencies. OCSRI has made much progress in that realm and must continue
to foster the cooperation both for the beneficial effects on the ground
and to provide the example to others. Much more needs to be developed in
the areas of appropriate educational efforts and in developing adequate
incentive programs. OSU, GWEB, and the watershed councils are all important
to success in these endeavors. Of these, OSU is conspicuous by its absence
and should be playing the lead role in providing research-based education.
</P>

<H4>Monitoring</H4>

<P>The monitoring program as described is ambitious and will require a
firm commitment of resources to initiate new monitoring activities and
to consistently compile and report the results in a timely manner. Monitoring
tends to be one of the first activities put on the back burner when resources
become tight. It is virtually impossible to know whether or not management
actions are producing desired results (positive trends) if an appropriate
monitoring program is not conducted and reported in a timely manner. </P>

<P>Adaptive management based on monitoring results is critical for directing
resources to activities that are more likely to result in positive trends.
Wasting resources on ineffective activities because monitoring was neglected
is a sure way to reduce support for this OCSRI effort. Adaptive management
requires a commitment to flexibility in changing policy, which will require
flexibility in &quot;rule making&quot; by the agencies involved. Bureaucratic
inertia will be detrimental to achieving positive results for the fish
and for maintaining support for OCSRI. </P>

<H3>Comments by Derek Godwin </H3>

<H4>Elements of a Conservation Plan </H4>

<P>I agree with the methodology for establishing priorities through watershed
councils on a basin-by-basin level. The most successful watershed councils
did not prioritize by &quot;core areas&quot; in the beginning; they prioritized
based on landowner involvement and how much the site could teach others
how to manage differently. First priority should be given to areas with
strong landowner commitment, then to the core areas, and third to habitat
and populations in suitable recovery areas nearby. </P>

<P>The South Coast watersheds have enough cooperation with landowners to
begin the second and third steps in prioritizing projects, but most coastal
areas are not at this stage. To be successful, we have to invest in community
restoration efforts that in turn address the core areas and improve habitat.
Otherwise, we have restoration projects and plans without community support
that die locally and/or lose political support. </P>

<H4>Barriers</H4>

<P>There are a huge number of barriers that are seen by private individuals
but not by agencies. Goals 1 and 3 give me the impression that small changes
will be made that help reduce barriers, while major changes that reduce
a large number of barriers will be ignored. </P>

<P>For example, there are many overlapping duties of state and federal
agencies for dealing with private land management. Conducting business
for years and years with the same roles within agencies has allowed us
to accumulate overlapping and unnecssary rules, regulations, processes,
procedures, etc. We need to take a hard look at agency duties from a local
resource manager perspective. Fifteen to 50 percent of my time (depending
on the project/educational program) as an Extension agent working with
local watershed councils is spent explaining to private individuals how
regulation processes work and how to get through the steps in conducting
on-the-ground projects, explaining agency data and information on health
of resources, and providing technical expertise that agency personnel are
not providing (when it is their procedure). </P>

<P>In addition, I have spent a huge amount of time getting agencies to
communicate, re-organizing agency data for distribution, and holding multi-agency
meetings to solve local problems. These are very serious problems that
keep grass roots efforts from being successful.</P>

<H4>Enforcement </H4>

<P>Each landowner/manager should have to sign on to an action plan and
county/city land-use plan to show commitment. A landowner/manager who doesn't
follow these plans or decides not to sign will be subject to blanket rules
and regulations (that are presently enforced). Or the landowner/manager
could submit his or her own habitat conservation plan. </P>

<P>This approach should allow agencies to spend less time enforcing rules
on groups following a plan, and spend the normal time on individuals unwilling
to cooperate. From my experience, I am positive that a landowner is much
less likely to get away with a violation if he/she is part of an active
council (versus an inactive one). Priorities still will have to be established
for correcting the offenders. There will not be enough money to support
all agencies in raising their means of enforcement. We should pool resources
and limit the number of violators through educational programs.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Legal"></A>Legal Brief</H3>

<H2>New Directions in Coastal Salmon Recovery </H2>

<P><B>By Richard Hildreth</B> </P>

<P>The recovery of weak coastal anadromous fish runs can involve quite
different legal and physical circumstances from Columbia-Snake River salmon.
Some of these were discussed in my &quot;Legal Brief&quot; (Summer 1996
Restoration) concerning coastal coho recovery and Oregon Governor John
Kitzhaber's proposed Coastal Salmon Restoration Initiative. Kitzhaber's
initiative joins two other Oregon salmon restoration initiatives mandated
by the 1995 Oregon legislature under Senate Bill 1127 and House Bill 2615.
Like the governor's, the two legislative initiatives are oriented toward
avoiding further listings under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA)
and reestablishing sustainable commercial and recreational salmon fisheries
in the state. Similar salmon restoration initiatives are underway in other
West Coast states and on a regionwide basis at the instigation of the region's
state governors.</P>

<P>Other significant new directions in coastal salmon recovery law and
policy concern recreational fishing, water quality standards, and the fate
of other endangered species.</P>

<H4>Recreational Fishing </H4>

<P>Some weak species, such as cutthroat trout (listed as endangered in
the Umpqua River) and steelhead (proposed to be listed as threatened or
endangered in the fall of 1997), are fished recreationally rather than
commercially. Federal-state recovery efforts are being orchestrated to
minimize the impacts on recreational fishing. Federal policy<SUP>(1) </SUP>supports
continued recreational fishing where impacts on ESA-listed species are
minimized. Habitat conservation plans (HCPs) that are federally approved
under ESA section 10(a) are one pathway that Oregon, Washington, and Idaho<SUP>(2)</SUP>
are pursuing to legalize recreational fishing that targets or incidentally
takes an ESA-listed species. HCPs could be the mechanism by which the state
of Oregon ultimately gains federal approval of Governor Kitzhaber's Coastal
Salmon Restoration Initiative. </P>

<H4>Water Quality</H4>

<P>New legal and administrative processes that improve water quality and
help anadromous fish recovery are being implemented. Water quality initiatives
of potentially great significance to anadromous fish recovery include the
listing by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality of up to 870
Oregon [stream] segments as water quality-limited pursuant to section 303(d)
of the federal Clean Water Act. This listing, which received federal Environmental
Protection Agency approval, will require both point and nonpoint source
polluters who contribute to the water quality violations to adjust their
activities. The applicable water quality standards were recently amended
to include temperature standards designed to aid fish survival. Achieving
those standards through the 303(d) process would be a major step toward
anadromous fish recovery. A recent decision of the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals<SUP>(3)</SUP> provides significant opportunities for citizen
involvement in this water quality improvement process. Similar listings
are occurring in other states in the region. </P>

<P>A second water quality initiative is the proposed application of Oregon's
coastal nonpoint source pollution control program throughout the entire
Umpqua and Rogue River basins, which would aid significantly the recovery
of weak anadromous fish stocks in those two key coastal basins. The program
has been prepared pursuant to section 6217 of the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization
Amendments of 1990. Its implementation would require the use of improved
best management practices to further reduce runoff pollution from activities
such as forestry, agriculture, and land development that have adversely
affected anadromous fish stocks in the past. Federal agencies such as the
Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management would have to act consistently
with the requirements of Oregon's coastal nonpoint source pollution program
once it is federally approved pursuant to section 6217. The other West
Coast states have developed similar programs under section 6217. </P>

<P>A third water quality proposal is Measure 38 on the November 1996 ballot.
The Clean Stream Initiative would establish stream buffers where livestock
grazing could not occur and provide tax incentives to livestock operators
who protect streams from such activities that have adversely impacted anadromous
fish in the past. </P>

<H4>Linking Recovery Efforts </H4>

<P>The connections between the recovery of weak salmonid stocks and the
recovery of other endangered and threatened watershed species have become
emphasized in some recent court decisions.</P>

<P>Actions taken toward the recovery of endangered Umpqua River cutthroat
trout and West Coast steelhead runs, which were recently proposed for listing
as threatened or endangered, will also aid the recovery of weak salmon
runs in those same streams and rivers. In some streams, salmon recovery
also is linked to the recovery of weak bull trout populations (for which
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has responsibility under the ESA). Beyond
the recovery of connected fish stocks, there are positive connections between
the recovery of listed forest bird species such as the spotted owl and
the marbled murrelet and weak anadromous fish runs.</P>

<P>In an important recent court decision for both spotted owl and anadromous
fish recovery, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected timber industry
legal challenges to the validity of President Clinton's forest plan, thereby
clearing the way for implementation of its species recovery-oriented provisions<SUP>(4)</SUP>.</P>

<P>Even more impressive has been the judicial support for the threatened
marbled murrelet in the face of harmful logging proposed under the federal
salvage timber rider law, most of whose provisions expired September 30,
1996. Twice in 1996, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld restrictions
on logging in old-growth national forests in California, Oregon, and Washington
that serve as egg-laying habitat for the marbled murrelet and also can
be important habitat for anadromous fish.<SUP>(5) </SUP>Protection of the
marbled murrelet also has been extended to privately owned coastal forest
lands not covered by the salvage timber rider. For example, in March 1996,
the California Board of Forestry, acting under the authority of both the
federal ESA and California's endangered species law, rejected a timber
company's proposed road construction activities that would have led to
the elimination of marbled murrelet habitat.<SUP> (6)</SUP> More recently,
extensive habitat critical to the marbled murrelet's recovery, whose protection
also will aid anadromous fish recovery, was designated under the ESA in
coastal forests up and down the West Coast.<SUP> (7)</SUP> In that critical
habitat, important to both the murrelet and anadromous fish, regulatory
attention will focus on the impacts of logging, farming, grazing, and streamside
development on species recovery. </P>

<P>Despite the foregoing protective steps, concerns about marbled murrelet
survival have led to the filing of a petition to change its ESA status
from threatened to endangered. Listing of the murrelet as endangered would
further strengthen the connections between murrelet recovery and West Coast
anadromous fish recovery. </P>

<H2><A NAME="Coho"></A>Coho Ruling Postponed </H2>

<P>In late October, the National Marine Fisheries Service announced it
would put off for six months its decision whether to add coho populations
in Oregon and northern California to the endangered species list. </P>

<P>The postponement, which had been expected by many Oregon officials,
angered environmental organizations which, in 1993, had petitioned NMFS
to list wild coho under the Act. Among other things, the groups had hoped
a listing would stop or slow logging in old-growth watersheds where the
salmon spawn. </P>

<P>It came as good news, however, to Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber's administration,
which had been racing the clock to complete its coho management and restoration
plan. State officials hope the plan, in draft form at the time NMFS announced
its decision, will persuade federal officials not to list the fish.</P>

<P>NMFS regional administrator William Stelle said the agency was delaying
its decision because of scientific uncertainty about whether the fish are
truly threatened with extinction. </P>

<P>The agency did agree to grant endangered species status to coho stocks
along a 300-mile stretch of central California coastline.</P>

<H3>Field Notes</H3>

<H2>&quot;Salmon <A NAME="Watch"></A>Watch&quot; nets student enthusiasm</H2>

<P><B>by Sandy Ridlington</B></P>

<P>Most learning is an act of faith. We read that the West was wild and
we believe it. We accept with barely a murmur the existence of invisible
entities such as quarks, electrons, and hemoglobin. What we know about
salmon and their habitat is mainly what others have told us. </P>

<P>If we could experience salmon in their habitat, would it make a difference?
The teachers who use Salmon Watch, an environmental education program developed
by Oregon Trout, think it would. Before Salmon Watch, teachers who wanted
their students to have field experience with salmon generally had only
one option--a trip to the local hatchery. &quot;And hatcheries,&quot; says
John Otto, life science teacher at Western View Middle School in Corvallis,
&quot;were often a brutal experience for the kids.&quot; </P>

<P>Designed for middle and high school students, Salmon Watch combines
teacher and volunteer training, classroom instruction, field trips to observe
spawning salmon, and student community projects. </P>

<P>At the heart of the program is the field trip, that moment when you
weigh the real world against book learning and usually find the latter
wanting. Field trips elicit a <I>Yuk </I>or a <I>Eureka</I>!, depending
on how you feel when you confront the carcass of a spawned-out salmon.</P>

<P>In early October, I accompanied Karol Simas's South Albany High School
oceanography class on their Salmon Watch field trip to the North Santiam.
As we boarded the school bus, a girl shouted to a late arrival, &quot;Hurry
up or we'll miss the salmon!&quot; That could be the whole point of the
program, I thought.</P>

<P>At Packsaddle Park, where most of the activities took place, the sky
was clear and a warm breeze moved through the ash and alder along the river
bank. The roar of the Santiam on one side of the park barely drowned out
the sound of traffic on the other. Last spring's flooding had scoured the
North Santiam, leaving big rocks along the banks. </P>

<P>The Salmon Watch curriculum encourages flexibility. Teachers can choose
from many subjects on a field trip, depending on available personnel and
the teacher's own interests. Simas had arranged for stations on water quality,
macroinvertebrates, riparian environment, fish biology, and salmon politics.
The instructors at these stations were representatives from the Oregon
Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), Willamette Industries, the Siuslaw
National Forest, and, of course, volunteers. </P>

<P>Two stations in particular brought Simas's class face-to-face with salmon.
</P>

<P>Caleb Slater, who recently finished a Ph.D. in fisheries and wildlife
from OSU, and Mike Ludwig, a science teacher from Amity, led a joint session
on water quality and macroinvertebrates. The result was a pleasant chaos.
Some students dipnetted mud, bugs, and small fish and placed them in plastic
painting trays; others measured the temperature and pH of the water. Slater
and Ludwig fielded a steady stream of questions. </P>

<P>&quot;What are macroinvertebrates anyway?&quot; asked a student.</P>

<P>&quot;Things you can see without a microscope that don't have a backbone,&quot;
shot back Ludwig, who clearly had answered that question a hundred times
before. </P>

<P>&quot;What's the caddis fly case made of?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wood,&quot;replied Slater. &quot;They eat wood and then spit it
out.&quot;</P>

<P>Sarah Kalina netted a small fish and laid it in an ice cube tray filled
with river water. &quot;Good catch,&quot; praised Slater. Everyone gathered
around the ice cube tray and bent over to examine the fish. &quot;It's
a salmon fry or trout,&quot; said Slater; &quot;it's hard to tell which.&quot;</P>

<P>By now, the students had also captured a mayfly, a sculpin fry, and
a cap from a bottle of Amber Ale. </P>

<P>Mike Ludwig explained that the mayfly is an indicator species. Because
it s not very tolerant of a variety of conditions, its absence warns us
that a stream is in trouble. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, the salmon -- or trout -- fry had grown still in its small,
hot pool. I stepped between it and the sun and the fry began at once to
wriggle again. When I pointed this out to Slater, he drew the students'
attention to the change, saying, You can see by this how young salmon really
like the shade.</P>

<P>A little brown frog jumped, unprodded, out of the river and into the
paint tray. Most of the students laughed, but one girl, still in a serious
taxonomic mood, asked, What kind of frog is this? Ludwig smiled at Slater
and answered, A little brown frog.</P>

<P>Time was running out for this station. Have we measured the dissolved
oxygen? asked a boy, intent on taking careful notes. </P>

<P>Dissolved oxygen is going to have to remain a mystery, responded Slater.
</P>

<P>The salmon we'd come to see were spring chinook. Spring chinook hatch
in December, hiding in the river when the spring floods come through. They
stay in the river for a year and then leave with the next spring floods.</P>

<P>Standing knee-high in the river, Wayne Hunt, a fisheries biologist with
ODFW, explained the life cycle of salmon to a small group of students.
Summer Bennett wrinkled her nose and said, Yuk! I'd hate to die after I'd
laid my eggs.</P>

<P>The lesson came full circle when, a few feet away, the group discovered
the carcass of a female chinook. They gathered around it, like family at
a wake, while Gary Galovich, also with ODFW, knelt before the dead fish
and described to the students the physiological changes that had occurred
in the fish during spawning. The wake broke up quickly when a maggot wriggled
out of one of the fish's eye sockets.</P>

<P>Earlier in the day, I had asked a number of Simas's students what the
difference was between learning about salmon from a book and learning in
the field. They were unanimous in their enthusiasm for hands-on instruction:
</P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;You learn and remember.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Being here is more fun&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You get to experience what you learn.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You feel like someone cares enough to show you.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;You understand the effect our actions have on salmon.&quot;</P>
</UL>

<P>At the end of the day, as our bus neared Albany, a girl sitting behind
me said, to no one in particular, &quot;If school were like this every
day, I d stay in school forever.&quot; Maybe that s what it will take to
save the salmon: a day in the field and a lifetime of learning. </P>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="Volunteers"></A>Volunteers for Salmon Watch </H2>

<P>Salmon Watch, Oregon Trout's environmental education program, relies
heavily on volunteers who work with students in the field. Who are these
volunteers? Lizanne Saunders, director of Education for Oregon Trout, says
they come from many different backgrounds and give their time for different
reasons, but they all believe that what they're doing can make a difference.
</P>

<P>Caleb Slater, a recent OSU doctoral graduate, began volunteering at
the urging of his wife, a teacher familiar with the Salmon Watch program.
&quot;You can come to a class and talk to students and what you say goes
right past them,&quot; says Slater. In the field, on the other hand, he
says, you can truly reach the students.</P>

<P>John Snelling, from OSU's Fisheries and Wildlife Department, volunteers,
says his wife, Mary-Dean, &quot;because he loves anything about fish: His
work is fish and his hobby is fishing.&quot; </P>

<P>When Bill Pye, also an avid fisher, retired from the Army, he began
to realize the effort needed to preserve the environment. So he threw himself
into preservation efforts--Adopt-a-River, the Salmon Trout Enhancement
Program, four sessions a year at the Sweet Home hatchery, and Salmon Watch.
Pye is also the only volunteer appointed to the Governor's Watershed Enhancement
Board. </P>

<P>Volunteers do not need to have a background in science. The Corvallis
area is unusual in having a large number of specialists, says Saunders.
In other parts of the state, volunteers come from many disciplines. In
Portland, for example, where it is more common to attract participants
from the community than from academia, Salmon Watch volunteers have included
lawyers, engineers, and retired doctors and teachers. Saunders notes that
perhaps the most effective volunteers are Native Americans. &quot;Students
who have a Native American volunteer on their trip are very moved by the
effects on the tribes of the loss of the salmon. As a result they seem
to feel a great deal of intensity about what they learned on the trip.&quot;

<H3>Opinion</H3>

<H2>Making the First Step Toward Community <A NAME="Service"></A>Service
</H2>

<P><B>By Jo Alexander</B></P>

<P>I was extremely interested in Joe Cone's <A HREF="http://seagrant.orst.edu/communications/396contents.html#Editorial:">editorial</A>
in Restoration (Summer 1996)--&quot;Salmon: What Can We Do?&quot;--probably
because one so rarely hears any really new ideas for dealing with our social
problems. It's so easy to fall into the trap of thinking that because everything
has always--i.e., as long as we can remember--been a certain way it must
remain that way. But how long has it been since working people got a 40-hour
week? Since blacks and whites have been permitted to marry throughout the
U.S.? Since women got the vote? All these changes must have seemed revolutionary
in their time, but now we take them for granted.</P>

<P>Cone's proposal, I fear, has less chance of realization in the U.S.
than it might have in Europe, which has a tradition of valuing community.
In this country, we value individualism, and people who make a difference
tend to do so as individuals rather than as members of a community. </P>

<P>This idea requires us and our employers to value the work we do for
society as a whole--work that does not immediately benefit our pay check
or our employer's bottom line. And while it's considered OK, for example,
for a company to externalize its costs by polluting the public water or
air, it seems bizarre to imagine our employer paying us to go and talk
over the salmon crisis with a group of other concerned citizens. Or to
spend an afternoon helping to restore a local stream. Or at City Hall,
helping to d raft a new water quality standard. Some people do make time
to do these things--time they could otherwise spend with their families,
at the movies, or reading a book. But for many of us, there just isn't
time. We are already juggling a career and family responsibilities. So
we just duck our heads and feel bad. </P>

<P>In the short term, this is going to continue to be reality for a lot
of Americans. But I'd like to issue a couple of challenges. The first is
to university faculty, who are already privileged not to have to account
for every hour of a 40-hour week. (Yes, I know--you already work 50 or
60 hours a week; but at least your time is reasonably flexible.) Make a
commitment of three hours a week, consistently, to your community. And
make your commitment public. Tell your friends. Write a letter to the editor,
with a copy to some influential people. </P>

<P>The other challenge is to the kinds of companies who are already in
the forefront of change, trying to be environmentally sensitive, offering
benefits that others are not offering, trying to be good corporate citizens.
Offer three hours a week to your employees to go out and do some work for
the community. Create a newsletter to publicize the results, and mail it
to as many places as possible (including Restoration!).</P>

<P>And imagine what you can achieve. </P>

<H2>Watershed Source <A NAME="Book"></A>Book Useful </H2>

<P><B>By Pat Corcoran </B></P>

<P>Whether you are new to watershed restoration councils or have been around
since the beginning, you will find the <I>Watershed Source Book</I> a useful
resource describing the promise and progress of watershed efforts across
the West. This comprehensive guide, published by the University of Colorado
Natural Resources Law Center, is subtitled <I>Watershed-Based Solutions
to Natural Resource Problems</I>. The publication can more accurately be
described as an encyclopedia of watershed-based approaches to natural resource
problems, since final solutions to these complex issues are rare. Enthusiasm
for the watershed approach to managing problems seasons the book but does
not detract from its thorough and accurate presentation of the current
state of council activity. The book's breadth, tone, and clear format make
for an engaging read. </P>

<P>Engaging as it is, the <I>Watershed Source Book</I> is not likely to
be read by anyone in a single sitting. Actually, it is unnecessary for
readers to work their way through the entire book to get value from it,
for it is primarily a reference book. Part I, a primer on watershed approaches
to resource management, offers a solid introduction to the theory and practice
of watershed restoration. Topics covered include the usefulness of the
watershed approach in resolving natural resource issues, characteristics
of watershed efforts, and practical considerations for organizing and managing
local watershed efforts. For those experienced in watershed restoration
work, this primer is a reminder of why a group might be having trouble.
One question posed is, &quot;How can participants stabilize a watershed
management effort so people will stay involved and the effort will remain
productive?&quot; Some suggestions are to &quot;appoint a facilitator,&quot;
and to &quot;choose a decision making structure that will avoid deadlock.&quot;
</P>

<P>Unfortunately, the authors devote only three pages to these methods
for maintaining effective councils. Hopes for a &quot;silver bullet&quot;
to meet such perennial challenges are predictably dashed. Once again we
are reminded that the care and feeding of councils is difficult work that
does not lend itself to quick solutions. On the other hand, the purpose
of the book is to highlight the &quot;best practices&quot; used by successful
watershed councils, and it does this very well.</P>

<P>Part II profiles the work of dozens of watershed councils across the
West. The efforts are organized by major regions, and original maps highlight
the profiled watersheds. The authors describe the council's background,
location and scale of the watershed, participants, problems involved, activities,
processes, goals, funding, and accomplishments, and the way in which participants
view success. They also provide information on how to contact each council.
Skimming these profiles, the reader gets a sense of the wide variety of
activities undertaken by watershed councils. In this regard, the collection
can serve as a source of new ideas for local groups.</P>

<P>The descriptions were developed primarily from phone interviews conducted
between March 1994 and July 1995. Whatever your niche, this book provides
both many specific examples and the broader context for working together
to improve the health of your watershed. </P>

<H3>Clinton Plan Headed Back to Court?</H3>

<H2>Salvage Logging in Key Watersheds<A NAME="salvage"></A></H2>

<P><I>by Pat Kight</I></P>

<P>The Clinton Administration's hard-won forest plan could be headed back
to court by early next year, thanks to legislation that has permitted logging
on some of the same lands the plan had targeted as critical salmon habitat.</P>

<P>In southern Oregon's Umpqua National Forest, for instance, logging proposed
under the so-called Salvage Rider has been so extensive that a U.S. Forest
Service wildlife biologist has said it jeopardizes the survival of the
region's most important wild run of cutthroat trout.</P>

<P>But most people involved say it will be difficult -- some say impossible
-- to gauge what effect the rider has had on west-side watersheds and salmon
habitats until after the end of this year.</P>

<P>Some sales have been sold but their contracts not awarded. Some awarded
sales have not yet been cut. Still others have been swapped for other trees
on other sites. No one, it seems, has solid numbers on how much timber
has been, or will be, cut by the time the Salvage Rider runs its course.</P>

<P>But many conservationists are already predicting that the whole issue
of timber harvesting on federal forest lands will wind up back in federal
court -- more than two years after U.S. District Judge William O. Dwyer
lifted an injunction that had halted most logging on west-side federal
forests since the early 1990s. Dwyer's 1994 ruling came as a direct acknowledgment
of the Clinton administration's adoption of &quot;Option 9,&quot; one of
a series of forest management options that had been posed by a panel of
scientists who spent months exploring how industry and the environment
might coexist.</P>

<P>The Clinton plan included conservation strategies that called for curtailment
of human activity, including logging, on thousands of acres of federal
forest land judged critically important to the survival of threatened and
endangered species, particularly the spotted owl and wild salmon stocks.</P>

<P>Barely a year after Dwyer issued his ruling, however, the 104th Congress
passed the Rescissions Timber Act Rider, commonly known as the Salvage
Rider, which Clinton subsequently signed into law. Advocates said the law
would promote forest health by allowing salvage of dead and dying trees,
particularly in forests that had been hit by fire in the preceding several
years.</P>

<P>The law, largely drafted by the timber industry, required the U.S. Forest
Service and Bureau of Land Management to proceed with three directives:</P>

<UL>
<LI>To move ahead on releasing timber sales contracts that had already
been set up in past years but never completed, largely because of court
challenges. If any of those sales could not be awarded, the agencies were
to find an equivalent amount of timber elsewhere and offer it instead.
That section of the rider expires this September 30.</LI>

<LI>To allow &quot;salvage logging&quot; of forests, mostly east of the
Cascades, which had been hit by fire. This section expires at the end of
1996.</LI>

<LI>To prepare and award timber sales on lands covered by theClinton Plan's
Option 9, regardless of prior court orders or environmental laws.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Critics charge that the measure was nothing more than a political end
run around the Clinton plan, which, despite skepticism from all sides,
had shown promise of ending the litigation wars that had pitted timber
and conservation interests against each other for years.</P>

<P>&quot;What we're looking at is an unbelievably profound contradiction
in public policy,&quot; says David Bayles, director of public lands issues
for the Pacific Rivers Council. &quot;Years of scientific effort culminated
in the president's plan. Yet almost immediately it was contradicted by
a purely political move by the Republican Congress . . . This was a very
clever, knowing, and calculated attempt to get around laws that were finally
starting to work.&quot;</P>

<P>The Salvage Rider's potential for disrupting the Clinton plan's conservation
strategy becomes clear when maps of planned and actual timber sales are
laid side by side with maps drawn up by the FEMAT team to delineate watersheds
deemed critical to salmon survival.</P>

<P>In the Umpqua National Forest, for instance, maps compiled by the National
Marine Fisheries Service show planned harvests cutting across the heart
of a vast watershed that is home to several wild salmonid stocks, including
the Umpqua River sea-run cutthroat, which was officially declared an endangered
species in early August.</P>

<P>Late last year, NMFS regional director William Stelle expressed concern
that five of those sales had not been reviewed for their potential to damage
the rivers and streambanks critical to the fish's survival. He urged the
Forest Service and BLM to sharply reduce the harvest volume &quot;to minimize
adverse effects . . . on anadromous salmonids.&quot; Even so, Stelle said,
his agency did not believe the harvests could proceed without doing some
harm to the fish.</P>

<P>Those sales, involving an estimated 25 million board feet of timber
across 1,671 acres, went forward without the assessment Stelle had suggested.
And the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently upheld an earlier judge's
ruling that the sales should proceed.</P>

<P>The Salvage Rider explicitly exempts logging under the act from most
environmental laws, including the Endangered Species and Clean Water acts.
Exceptions are made for areas where threatened birds are known to be nesting,
in which case federal timber managers are required to swap the suspect
sites for timber elsewhere.</P>

<P>There are no provisions for stopping sales that threaten fish habitat.</P>

<P>The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund (SCLDF), a San Francisco-based public-interest
law firm, has filed numerous court actions on behalf of groups attempting
to slow or stop specific sales under the Salvage Rider. Federal courts,
however, have ordered the sales to proceed and denied legal standing to
most groups that have tried to intervene in the process. Without standing,
a group has no legal right to information about exactly how much timber
has been cut and in which areas.</P>

<P>While much of the legal activity has focused on specific sales and regions,
the SCLDF and other organizations are considering whether to file broader
challenges arguing that the Salvage Rider jeopardizes the very heart of
the Clinton plan's Option 9.</P>

<P>&quot;That's the next absolute crux issue, both on the ground and in
the courtroom,&quot; says Kristen Boyles, an SCLDF attorney in Seattle.
&quot;But until the rider runs its course, we won't be able to review what's
actually happened and decide what to do.&quot;</P>

<P>Some long-time participants in Oregon's forest and watershed debate
point out that, at best, the Clinton plan's Option 9 gave threatened salmon
somewhere on the order of a 65 percent better shot at long-term survival,
compared to the practices of the past. Now they wonder if even that measure
of protection has been lost.</P>

<P>&quot;It was never certain that this plan would succeed in saving the
fish,&quot; says the Pacific Rivers Council's David Bayles. &quot;It was
a matter of probability. It isn't any more.&quot;</P>

<H3>Editorial:</H3>

<H2>Salmon: What Can We Do?<A NAME="Editorial:"></A></H2>

<P><I>by Joe Cone</I></P>

<P>What can Northwesterners <I>do </I>about the regional salmon crisis?</P>

<P>I believe that many, perhaps most, residents of the Northwest do not
want to see salmon slip into extinction. Our problem is, as we go about
our full and often hectic daily lives, that we scarcey have the opportunity
to <I>think </I>about all this, let alone do much individually. So we worry,
vaguely, and hope that someone else, presumably someone who's paid to do
something, will take care of our collective interests in the salmon decline.
This is the way our society operates.</P>

<P>So what's wrong with that?</P>

<P>What's wrong, I think, is that without the public involved, defining
what the public's interest is, the &quot;public good&quot; is often not
clear and even less often achieved. To greater or lesser degrees, virtually
all the parties engaged today have their <I>own </I>interests first, and
the public's and the fishes' later -- maybe.</P>

<P>What I'm saying is not exactly news. This, again, is the way our society
is governed, through self-interested groups, including the &quot;interest
groups.&quot; It's so much the way things are that it seems like heresy,
or naivete, to say that, of course, it could be different.</P>

<P>I believe it needs to be different, for even if all the hard-working
activitists, dedicated bureaucrats, and cooperative landowners were to
pull in the same direction, <I>and </I>overcome inertia and resistance,
I'm still not sure we would get much salmon recovery.</P>

<P>That's for two additional reasons peculiar to large-scale ecosystem
problems, of which the salmon crisis is a leading example. Those reasons:
space and time.</P>

<P>It won't be enough to have only interested groups engaged in salmon
recovery, because of the physical scale of the salmon crisis. It covers
essentially the entire Northwest; virtually everyone in the Northwest affects
salmon in some way. (This is not to make the inane argument that all parties
in the Northwest are equally responsibly, historically, or equally capable,
right now, of affecting change. People have more and less direct effects
on the salmon. Developing a shopping center is different from logging a
hillside is different from spraying your lawn with pesticides is different
from ... )</P>

<P>It also won't work to have salmon recovery be only this year's attention
grabber for opinion leaders and community &quot;movers and shakers.&quot;
Those leaders will, in the nature of things, get diverted to other things
in a year, or two, or five. Real, robust recovery of salmon and their freshwater
ecosystems is likely to take much more time -- maybe only 10 years some
places, but maybe 25 or 100 years in others. No one knows for sure how
long, but biologists warn it won't be short, easy or straight-ahead.</P>

<P>So what's the solution? What can Northwesterners <I>do </I>about the
salmon crisis?</P>

<P>I don't see any other way: More of us need to be involved, and the effort
must be sustained. The only way, I believe, that we have a hope of widespread
salmon recovery in the region is by relearning and applying some old-fashioned
democratic principles. We need (1) broad-based citizen <I>discussion </I>of
the public good, relating to salmon, (2)&nbsp;similarly broad-based citizen
<I>participation </I>in striving toward this identified good, and (3) a
means of <I>nurturing </I>the discussion, understanding and participation
over time.</P>

<P><I>Right</I>, you say. <I>Tall order.</I></P>

<P><I>How do we do this?</I></P>

<P>Nothing will change if we don't find the time. As the Canadian historian
John Ralston Saul argues, freeing the time to act is a necessary first
act:</P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;Corporatist society has structured itself so as to eliminate citizen
participation in public affairs, except through the isolated act of voting
and through voluntary activities. These voluntary activities involve sacrificing
time which has been put aside, formally, for other activities. Thus sports,
meals, holidays, to say nothing of work, are actually structured into our
financial and social rewards system. Citizen participation is not. ...
And yet, by simply setting aside a certain number of hours a week through
our structuring of the official activities of the individual -- we should
be able to launch large numbers of people into public activity.&quot;</P>
</UL>

<P>Imagine. Imagine if we structured our social life so that people had,
say, three or four hours a week that could be devoted to the public good
-- to &quot;disinterested&quot; activity for the common good, as opposed
to self-interested activity. Not time eked out of other responsbilities,
but time allocated from work, from play, as a recognized, rewarded part
of the citizen's role in our public life. Imagine how apparently impossible-to-resolve
issues could at least begin to be addressed.</P>

<P><I>OK</I>, you say. <I>Sounds unlikely, but might be worth a try. Where
do we start?</I></P>

<P>Personally, I'm not sure. I dont' know whether we can expect our elected
leaders to advocate disinterested citizen participation. It would be fascinating
if John Kithaber or Phil Keisling, say, would make this their cause and
advocate a new &quot;Oregon Experiment&quot; of broad-based, citizen participation
in governance. But this may be one of those moments when leadership must
come from those who feel that what's at risk is too important to just let
die.</P>

<H3>Legal Brief:<A NAME="Legal"></A></H3>

<H2>Aspects of Coastal Coho Recovery</H2>

<P><I>by Richard Hildreth</I></P>

<P>Jim Martin, coordinator of Governor Kitzhaber's <A 
HREF="http://pp5.das.state.or.us/salmon/">Coastal
Salmon Restoration Initiative</A>, estimates that in about 1900 there were
an average of 1.6 million annually migrating wild coho salmon returning
to the Oregon coast south of the Columbia River and north of California.
But in the past decade the annual returns of wild coastal coho have been
below 100,000. Winter 1996 spawning counts indicated a near record low
of 39,000 wild spawners.</P>

<P>Coho runs on 55 percent of their former habitat are now extinct. Multiple
petitions were filed with the <A HREF="http://kingfish.ssp.nmfs.gov/">National
Marine Fisheries Service</A> (NMFS) to list remaining West Coast coho salmon
species as threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species
Act. On July 19, 1995, NMFS proposed listing Oregon and California coho
salmon as threatened. A final decision by the agency is expected this fall.</P>

<P>In the meantime, the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) has drastically
reduced commercial and recreational coho fishing in federal waters beyond
three nautical miles off northern California, Oregon, and Washington. The
states have adopted similar restrictions for state coastal waters extending
three nautical miles seaward. Millions of dollars in federal compensation
have been allocated to individuals and entities adversely affected by these
decisions.</P>

<P>Responding to the decline of coastal coho is one of the West Coast's
most challenging sustainability issues. It involves watershed land use
changes, habitat loss, and water quality degradation and their impacts
on an important marine resource. The coho decline thus crosses traditional
jurisdictional boundaries.</P>

<P>The legal and physical circumstances of coastal coho are quite different
from Columbia-Snake River salmon because of the absence of large hydroelectric
dams as a principal factor in their decline and recovery. Coastal coho
recovery implicates a wide variety of coastal resource uses beyond the
commercial and recreational fishing sectors that have borne the brunt of
initial actions taken in support of recovery. Habitat alterations in coastal
watersheds appear to be a major factor in the decline of coastal coho.
The mix of publicly and privately owned resources in coastal watersheds
complicates the implementation of coho recovery actions.</P>

<P>The principal causes of West Coast coho salmon decline include overfishing,
adverse ocean conditions, hatchery operations, and freshwater and estuarine
habitat deterioration. Existing federal, state, and local resource management
laws have been insufficient to prevent the decline. Some factors such as
adverse ocean conditions are mostly outside the control of relevant legal
systems. For factors such as habitat deterioration, however, changed laws
and improved implementation and coordination appear to be very relevant
to coastal coho recovery.</P>

<P>Such changes and improvements appear to be a necessary, but not necessarily
sufficient, condition for coastal coho recovery. The long-term decline
of coastal coho populations correlates with the deterioration of their
freshwater habitat caused by human disturbances. Coho are especially vulnerable
to loss or degradation of their freshwater spawning, summer rearing, and
winter rearing habitats.</P>

<H4>Many Watershed Players</H4>

<P>Federally, at least 12 different federal agencies operating under different
statutory mandates have watershed water management responsibilities. At
the state level in Oregon, 16 agencies are involved in managing watersheds,
and the figures appear to be similar for California and Washington.</P>

<P>Local governments too are significant players in watershed management.
However, a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision appears to impose major information
gathering and analysis obligations on local governments that regulate private
land uses adversely affecting watershed conditions, at least where the
local government attempts to impose public access requirements on the landowner.
Federal courts have required compensation payments to some landowners who
were denied permission to fill wetlands on their property. On the other
hand, other federal and state court decisions are quite supportive of aggressive
federal and state agency implementation of their federal <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/OWOW/OST/pc/cwao.html">Clean
Water Act </A>(CWA), <A HREF="http://www.fws.gov/~r9endspp/esa.html">Endangered
Species Act</A> (ESA), and other obligations to protect watershed water
quality.</P>

<P>The relevance of the legal framework outlined above is illustrated by
the key concept in coho recovery, namely, riparian zone protection and
restoration. As compared to the habitat for endangered and threatened Columbia-Snake
River salmon, more of the riparian habitat for coastal coho is in private
ownership (approximately two-thirds), and the one-third of coho habitat
that is in public ownership tends to be more degraded than the riparian
habitat for Columbia-Snake river salmon. Thus coastal coho recovery inevitably
will involve federal, state, and local regulation of private riparian land
as well as improved management of publicly owned riparian habitat.</P>

<P>By this fall, Governor Kitzhaber's natural resources staff hopes to
have put together a coastal salmon restoration program sufficiently strong
to avoid the listing of Oregon coastal coho as endangered or threatened
under the federal Endangered Species Act. The program will be a combination
of beefed-up state regulatory programs and voluntary cooperative restoration
efforts, including local coastal watershed councils established and funded
under 1993 and 1995 state legislation.</P>

<P>Regulatory examples include the state Water Resources Department (WRD)
review of pending water diversion applications involving the north, middle,
and south coast, Rogue, and Umpqua basins to identify potential impacts
on both coastal coho and steelhead populations. This case-by-case review
will be performed as part of the existing WRD public interest review of
diversion applications.</P>

<P>WRD is also developing amendments to those review criteria for sensitive,
threatened, and endangered fish. This spring, as the program was being
assembled, the governor intervened to limit railroad repairs along the
coastal Salmonberry River to avoid interference with spawning by one of
the state's healthiest steelhead runs. Enforcement of the program's goals
would be strengthened by passage at the November 1996 election of the Oregon
Clean Stream Initiative. The initiative would establish stream buffers
where livestock grazing cannot occur and provide tax incentives to livestock
operators who protect streams.</P>

<P>Critical to the governor's program's success will be:</P>

<OL>
<LI>support from the 1997 Oregon legislature in the form of needed amendments
to existing regulatory programs and funding for the necessary agency efforts
to implement the program, as well as continued financial support for the
previously established local watershed councils;</LI>

<LI>federal agency cooperation, which is harder to achieve outside the
ESA framework; and</LI>

<LI>citizen monitoring of the implementation of the governor's program.</LI>

<H2>Salmon Crisis Began Century Ago</H2>

<P>Editor's Note: Readers of <I>Restoration </I>know that the contemporary
crisis over declining salmon runs in the Northwest did not just happen
overnight. Probably few people appreciate, however, how long a &quot;salmon
crisis&quot; has been recognized by those most familiar with the status
of, and the trends relating to, the fish. A book recently published by
<A HREF="http://www.orst.edu/dept/press/osupress.htm">Oregon State University
Press</A> collects dozens of documents relating to this century-long salmon
decline and the recognition of it. Printed below are two excerpts from

<UL>
<P>It does not require a study of statistics to convince one that the salmon
industry has suffered a great decline during the past decade, and that
it is only a matter of a few years under present conditions when the Chinook
salmon of the Columbia will be as scarce as the beaver that was once so
plentiful in our streams. Common observation is amply able to apprehend
a fact so plain. For a third of a century, Oregon has drawn wealth from
her streams, but now, by reason of her wastefulness and lack of intelligent
provision for the future, the source of that wealth is disappearing and
is threatened with complete annihilation. No private individual so wasteful
and improvident of his resources would receive the least sympathy from
his fellows if he died in poverty and was buried in the potter's field.
States like individuals should conserve their sources of income, else they
neither deserve nor can expect to enjoy continued prosperity.</P>

<P>Though this decadence of the fisheries is plain, a study of the statistics
given elsewhere in this report will impress the matter more strongly upon
the mind. It will then be seen that the deterioration is more marked and
serious than the mere surface conditions indicate. In studying these statistics,
it must be borne in mind that the period that elapses from the spawning
of the young salmon until it returns to the river to procreate is four
years, according to the opinion of pisciculturists; consequently, any interruption
of natural propagation would not show its deleterious effects until four
years had passed. Likewise, any measures to increase production, whether
by natural or artificial means, would not show any apparent results in
the increase of the number of fish in the river for four years.</P>

<P>This means that the results of our past folly will continue to be felt
for at least a period of four years longer, and that the measures now taken
to retrieve our error must wait the necessary period for their full fruition.
The five years from 1880 to 1884 inclusive was the period of the greatest
activity in the canning of Chinook salmon, the pack ranging from 530,000
cases in 1880 to 620,000 in 1884, the highest point being reached in 1883,
a total of 629,000 cases. The effects of this excessive fishing were felt
as soon as the necessary four years had passed, and with 1885 the run of
Chinook salmon began perceptibly to decrease. In five years, notwithstanding
still more close and persistent fishing, the pack of Chinook had declined
more than one half, and stood at 266,697 cases. For the next three years
it was from 60,000 to 90,000 greater, but in 1893 had fallen to 290,000,
and the past season was 351,082. The total pack of salmon on the Columbia
has by no means fallen so low, as the figureswill show, but the difference
is made up of inferior fish. Salmon that ten years ago the canners would
not touch now constitute from 30% to 40% of the pack. The famous Chinook,
upon which the reputation of the Columbia rests, and whose higher prices
in the market enables our canners to compete with those of other sections
whose product is put up at a much less cost to the packers, has fallen
off to less than two thirds the quantity of a decade ago, with the probability
that it will still further decline before remedial measures can be made
effective. In its place an inferior fish is being substituted, that may
do irreparable damage to the reputation of the Columbia River before the
average quality of the pack has been restored by an increase of the Chinook.</P>

<P>There is another feature that is entitled to consideration. When the
great pack was made a decade ago fishermen received less than one half
they do now for fish and made more money. The price of Chinook fish to
canners has gradually increased, and this season the canners paid fivecents
a pound, averaging $1.10 per fish. Meanwhile the price of canned salmon
has declined in the market. With this increase in the price paid for fish
and decrease in the value of their product, canners have only been able
to continue in the business by the adoption of improved methods of operating
and in effecting a saving in other directions sufficient to offset these
disadvantages. The business has concentrated and the number of canneries
has decreased one half. Whether they can continue to meet the conditions
imposed by this decrease in the supply of fish is a serious question. Certainly
a marked increase of fish in the river and a consequent reduction of the
first cost to packers would place the industry on the Columbia in a better
position to compete successfully with those of Alaska and British Columbia.</P>

<P>The salmon runs of the Columbia River constitute one of the most important
natural resources of the states of Oregon and Washington. Thousands of
people are dependent, wholly or in part, upon these resources for their
livelihood; and their welfare is dependent upon the maintenance of the
salmon runs. It is to the special interest of these people that the salmon
supply be maintained at the level of maximum productivity and, indirectly,
it is to the interest of all the citizens of these states that this be
done.</P>

<P>In recent years it has become increasingly evident that these resources,
taken as a whole, are decreasing in productivity and it has been frequently
pointed out that this decrease is due primarily to the operation of two
factors&Ntilde;a very intensive fishery and a reduction in spawning and
rearing areas due to the utilization of the water resources of the Columbia
basin for other purposes. These in&szlig;uences, however, have affected
the several species of salmon that are found in the Columbia River quite
differently; the more valuable species, Chinooks and bluebacks, showing
more evidence of depletion than do the other species, silver salmon, chums
and steelhead...</P>

<P>The future outlook for the salmon fishery of the Columbia River is not
bright, but neither is it hopeless. The situation calls for energetic measures
if further depletion is to be prevented, to say nothing of attaining some
measure of restoration. Much additional information will be needed if our
efforts to maintain and improve the runs are to be efficient. It will be
necessary to restrict the commercial fishery to reduce catches, to improve
conditions on the breeding grounds and to be eternally watchful that in
the further development of water resources due consideration is given from
the beginning to the needs of salmon conservation.</P>

<P>The effects of whatever measures are adopted must be continually studied
in order that their efficiency may be accurately determined, that good
methods may be improved and poor ones discarded. This will mean on the
part of all elements in the salmon industry the sacrifice of immediate
gain for the benefit of the future. It will even mean sacrifice on the
part of some of the agencies whose duty it will be to impose restrictions
and which depend upon taxation of the catch for their income. Such sacrifices
require courage as well as foresight and will bring a certain amount of
hardship: But, if the courage is lacking now to take the steps necessary
to sensible conservation, we shall have the losses and the hardships eventually
anyway; with the difference that, if action is delayed, depletion will
have progressed further and rehabilitation made just so much more difficult.</P>

<P>This will mean also unselfish cooperation on the part of all agencies
directly concerned with the development and prosecution of a conservation
program: They must be able to present a strong and united front to the
opposing forces, and they must act promptly. A few more years of inaction,
of failure to attack the fundamental phases of these problems, and the
runs may well have been reduced to a state of commercial extinction from
which, if recovery is possible at all, it can be accomplished only after
a long time and at great expense.</P>

<H2>Ecological Perspectives on Sustainability</H2>

<P><I>by Jane Lubchenco</I></P>

<P><I>Editor's Note: In June, Oregon Sea Grant sponsored a conference called
&quot;Sustaining Oregon's Coast and Communities: Issues and Opportunities.&quot;One
of the more than 20 speakers in this conference on coastal sustainability
was a distinguished ecologist from Oregon State University. Jane Lubchenco
is a member of the <A HREF="http://www2.nas.edu/nas/">National Academy
of Sciences</A>, the past president of the Ecological Society of America,
and the current president of the <A HREF="http://www.aaas.org/">American
Association for the Advancement of Science </A>(AAAS), arguably the most
important scientific organization in the world. So it was with considerable
interest that conference attendees prepared to hear Lubchenco's talk about
issues relating to the sustainability of the Oregon coast. What follows
is an excerpt from the talk, slightly edited for print. The entire text
of her talk and those of other speakers will be available from Oregon Sea
Grant shortly; for additional information on the conference see page 11.</I></P>

<CENTER><P>* * *</P></CENTER>

<P>The scientific understanding about sustainability has changed very dramatically
in the last decade or so, especially with respect to four different areas
which I want to highlight. The first has to do with the <I>scales </I>at
which we think about it, the second with the <I>endpoints</I> that we talk
about, the third with our ability to<I> predict outcomes</I>, and the fourth
with <I>limits</I>.</P>

<P>Based on this new understanding we are in the process of a real revolution
in our thinking about sustainability, not only from a scientific perspective
but from a social perspective as well. In fact, we have an urgent need
to develop a new ethic, new economics, new institutions, and a new science
of sustainability. These are in the process of happening. There's need
for thoughtful discussions, but there's also need for action -- action
taken in a way that fully uses the understanding that's available and takes
precautionary approaches.</P>

<P>. . . If you ask most people what we get from nature, by and large people
focus on the goods that we get: food, fiber, genes, medicines, chemicals.
What we are beginning to appreciate, but don't really appreciate enough,
is a whole different category of &quot;things&quot; that people get from
nature. We call these <I>ecological services</I>, or ecosystem services.
These services are provided to us by the functioning of ecological systems.
They include such things as the regulation of climate, generation of fertile
soils, production of the &quot;goods&quot; themselves, provision of nursery
habitats, and protection against coastal erosion by kelp forests.</P>

<P>For example, coral reefs provide habitat -- nursery areas for other
species -- and they also provide protection against coastal erosion. Mangroves
collect sediment as it comes down rivers and prevent that sediment from
totally smothering coral reefs downstream. Another very important ecosystem
service is that of detoxifying pollutants -- be they in the air, in the
water, or in the soil. So there is a suite of ecosystem services that we
are just beginning to be aware of that, together with the ecological goods,
provide what has been called our life support systems for people on Earth.</P>

<P>Both the goods and the services are what we ultimately depend upon.
These ecological services are not part of our economic valuation system.
We don't put a price on them. We don't trade them. There's no penalty for
doing some activity that results in the loss of an ecosystem service. We
do trade goods; they have an economic value. But we don't have a counterpart
for ecosystem services. Yet we are as dependent on ecosystem services as
we are on those goods.</P>

<H4>New Thinking Needed</H4>

<P>What is happening regionally, nationally, and globally is an erosion
of our natural capital -- an erosion of the productive capacity of many
of our ecosystems to continue to provide these ecosystem services. We don't
have a mechanism for measuring how that's happening. We don't have an economic
system that recognizes that it's important. We don't have institutions
that are focused on preserving these ecosystem services. This is a fairly
new topic among ecologists; it's one a lot of people are working on actively,
and one that really needs to be part of our thinking about sustainability.</P>

<P>Sustaining communities requires sustaining the ecosystems on which those
communities depend. To sustain those ecological systems requires maintenance
of the processes that are producing not only the goods but the services.</P>

<P>We recently had a very nice opportunity to conduct an international
scientific assessment having to do with biological diversity, and one of
the major topics in that global biodiversity assessment had to do with
the relationship between biological diversity and the functioning of ecological
systems. This is a very active area scientifically, and a lot of new information
is coming out. The bottom line is that some kinds of ecological processes
are fairly robust and are not very sensitive to changes in diversity--be
it diversity at the genetic species or ecosystem level. Those processes
tend to be the ones that people usually measure, like productivity. It's
not that they are not sensitive at all, it's that they are much less sensitive
than many other kinds of ecological processes that are intimately required
to provide these ecosystem services.</P>

<P>Again, our thinking about sustainability has changed dramatically. The
scale at which we think about it has changed. The endpoints are changing.
They haven't changed yet, but they are changing. We should be shifting
from thinking just about commodities to thinking about sustaining entire
ecosystems, both the goods and the services. We need the genetic and ecological,
biological diversity in communities to continue to provide those ecosystem
services as well as the goods.</P>

<P>. . . I would like to close by mentioning the report from the President's
Council on Sustainable Development*. I think it provides a really phenomenal
first step in describing a vision for the future that is economically feasible,
socially just, and ecologically sound. It doesn't define all of the ways
to get there, but I think it provides a nice template to begin thinking
about where we want to go. I think that's where we have to start.</P>

<P>What kind of a world do we want? How do we get there? There are a lot
of uncertainties. We don't have the luxury of being able to talk about
this forever. I cannot overestimate the urgency of the unsustainable trajectory
that I think the world is on now. The need of local communities to decide
where they want to go and to act locally is of critical importance. It
also needs to be coupled with the national and international dialogue,
because many of the processes that determine our future are local as well
as international. I'm optimistic that together we can define a future.
I think it's very, very difficult for us to get there, but the kind of
dialogue that we're having here is a very appropriate beginning.</P>

<P>But it has to be followed by action.</P>

<H2>Environmental Improvement<A NAME="Improvement"></A> to Sustain Coastal
Communities</H2>

<P><I>by Bob Doppelt</I></P>

<P><I>Editor's Note: Another provocative speaker at the &quot;Sustaining
Oregon's Coast and Communities&quot; conference was Bob Doppelt. Until
recently the executive director of the Pacific Rivers Council, Doppelt
now coordinates a new division of the council, the Center for Watershed
and Community Health. Doppelt's talk focused on connections between environmental
health and economic well-being from an unexpected perspective. He discussed
&quot;the economic importance -- to individual business firms, to workers,
and to whole communities -- of protecting and restoring the environment.&quot;
His conclusion is excerpted here.</I></P>

<CENTER><P>* * *</P></CENTER>

<P>I want to suggest that one of the most important steps coastal communities
and businesses can undertake to protect and enhance their economic well-being
is to initiate a comprehensive initiative to improve coastal environmental
conditions.</P>

<P>I believe it is possible for communities, businesses, and all levels
of government to seize the opportunity presented by the crash of the salmon
to improve communities, quality of life, and existing businesses, and to
create new business and job opportunities. Smart businesses, and smart
coastal communities, can turn the environmental concerns into a comparative
advantage to increase [their] economic, social, and environmental well-being.</P>

<P>How is this possible?</P>

<P>By instituting a unique initiative that goes well beyond the natural
resource and fish management side of things to involve all key coastal
sectors in a comprehensive environmental and economic improvement initiative.</P>

<P>Rather than focusing only on timber landowners or fishing interests,
why not ask every economic and social sector to participate in the process?</P>

<P>a. For example, the sectors could be large industrial timber, smaller
nonindustrial timber, streamside residential, urban, agriculture, pulp
and paper industries, nonindustrial businesses (printing, health care,
etc.), consumer groups, recreational fishing, and commercial fishing. All
could be asked to participate.</P>

<P>b. Each sector could be asked to organize itself into groups that can
work as teams to assess the sector's operations and recommend their own
solutions to improve their environmental performance.</P>

<P>c. The goals and targets for such a process would need to be established
by a mutually agreed upon committee of independent scientists. For example,
a target may be set to increase riparian cover by 25 percent on agricultural
lands within 10 years -- or to decrease toxic discharges from urban areas
into streams and associated groundwater by 95 percent within 5 years, or
to decrease the amount of impervious pavement within each of the state's
watersheds to less than 5 percent within 10 years.</P>

<P>d. Rather than imposing new rules and regulations, each sector would
be allowed to work among its members to determine the most efficient way
to reach the targets set by the scientists. The long-term goals for each
sector would not be negotiable, but the methods for getting there would
be.</P>

<P>e. One outcome would be written agreements with all parties and the
state and federal government for implementing the plans. For example, the
agricultural sector may devise a strategy that includes proposed tax incentives,
easements, land acquisitions, etc. Urban areas may propose new legislation,
broad-based consumer education programs, pollution discharge taxes, etc.</P>

<P>I am sure this must sound overwhelming. However, we have examples from
others that have taken on similar challenges today, including the state
of New Jersey, the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe, and New Zealand.
These initiatives are targeted at much larger issues than watershed and
native fish recovery. With proper planning and a renewed spirit of hope
and cooperation, we can do it in Oregon.

<H2>Supplementation<A NAME="Supplementation"></A> of Naturally Spawning
Populations Risky</H2>

<P><I>By Reg Reisenbichler</I></P>

<P>Supplementation programs involve releasing hatchery fish to augment
the numbers of naturally spawning fish. Some people say that the practice
will have only a trivial effect on the carrying capacity or productivity
for the naturally spawning populations, particularly if wild (naturally
spawned) fish exclusively are used for hatchery brood stock -- that is,
if hatchery fish always are only one generation removed from wild fish.</P>

<P>I examined this thesis using existing data and a simple model to evaluate
the cumulative effects of supplementation over several generations, and
find the thesis to be false. The existing data better support the hypothesis
that supplementation of naturally spawning salmon populations with hatchery
fish will substantially decrease the productivity of fish spawning naturally,
and <I>may result in total production far less than anticipated </I>if
genetic changes are not considered [italics added].</P>

<P>Natural selection for fish that do well in the hatchery environment
(domestication selection) has been demonstrated for steelhead. Such domestication
coincides with loss in genetic fitness or survival for rearing in natural
streams.</P>

<P>This loss should reduce the carrying capacity and productivity (adult
progeny per spawner) for naturally spawning steelhead populations when
hatchery fish breed with these populations. The magnitude of reduction
depends, in part, on when the period of limiting (density dependent) mortality
occurs for naturally rearing fish.</P>

<P>The available data suggest progressively declining fitness for natural
rearing with increasing generations in the hatchery. The reduction in survival
from egg to adult may be about 25 percent after one generation in the hatchery,
and 85 percent after many (six) generations. Such reductions for an entire
population in stream systems where the amount of spawning habitat limits
the naturally spawning population would reduce carrying capacity and productivity
by these same amounts. Reduction in survival from yearling to adult may
be about 15 percent after one generation in the hatchery, and 67 percent
after many generations. Such reductions for an entire population in stream
systems where the limiting period for natural production occurs at or shortly
before the juvenile fish become yearlings would reduce carrying capacity
and productivity by these same amounts.</P>

<H4>Cumulative Effects</H4>

<P>. . . The cumulative effects of supplementation will vary with the proportion
of wild fish brought into the hatchery each year, the productivities of
hatchery and natural rearing, and the period of density-dependent limitation
in the natural stream. Although I considered results for only a few combinations
of these parameters, the results are sufficient to show that managers can
seriously overestimate the benefits of hatchery supplementation by ignoring
the genetic consequences. Modifying hatchery environments to reduce domestication
selection may reduce the genetic problems, but the practicable level of
reduction is unknown and may be slight.</P>

<P>A reasonable set of scenarios shows that actual production with supplementation
can be only one-third that expected if the genetic consequences of hatchery
rearing are ignored.</P>

<P>Additional work is needed to better describe and understand the rates
of genetic change in survival or fitness (domestication and naturalization)
for steelhead, where some data already exist, and also for other species
of salmon, where no data exist. More research is needed also to predict
the cumulative effects of supplementation for other sets of parameter values,
and to design and evaluate alternative hatchery environments for reducing
domestic selection.</P>

<h2><a name="toward"></a>Toward a Restoration Culture </h2>

<p><i>In the last issue of Restoration (Winter 1996), readers were invited
to share their &quot;stories, traditions, perspectives, and rituals&quot;
about salmon restoration. </i></p>

<p><i>&quot;Restoration tends to focus on programs, policies, and institutional
developments,&quot; I wrote. &quot;We know, however, that the place where
restoration will ultimately succeed or fail is in the hearts and minds
of individuals. </i></p>

<p><i>&quot;To ground us, to sustain us in reinhabiting the places we live
in, we must make our own stories and traditions of restoration, of giving
and putting back.&quot; </i></p>

<p><i>A number of readers responded to this call, contributing their thoughts
and feelings in a variety of forms -- letter, reminiscence, memorandum,
drama, speech. Because of our limited space we could not print all the
items we received, or any of them in their entirety. But we think that
what we have printed here makes a fine contribution to our collective understanding
of our own place in this region of the salmon. </i></p>

<p><i>I believe we can all learn from the thoughtfulness and the passion
presented by these writers, who, we recognize, reflect the concerns and
values of many other people. </i></p>

<h2>Learning Salmon <a name="learning"></a></h2>

<p><i>By Susan Cross </i></p>

<p>In my twenty-three years as a transplanted Pacific Northwesterner I
have known on an intellectual level the importance of the salmon to this
landscape, how they shaped the native cultures and our own. I understood
the incredible role they have long played in the ecology of our rivers
and streams, near the sea and far from the sea. </p>

<p>I possessed this knowledge and yet I didn't really know the salmon.
... Recently I came to know the salmon in a different way and now I am
a different person. I am now <i>passionate </i>about salmon.</p>

<p>Traveling in southeast Alaska in late August we came upon stream after
stream full of pinks. These fish, the smallest of the salmon species, were
literally head to tail and side to side, an undulating, shadowy presence,
from stream bank to stream bank and as far into the distance as you could
see in both directions. On every stream we crossed, there were the fish,
working hard to move upstream or resting in slower currents. They were
something you could feel as a presence, and they were a peaceful presence;
like soft rains, like the warmth of sunlight, like green leaves unfolding
in the spring. </p>

<p>I realized in Alaska that this force had been eliminated from the landscapes
of the Pacific Northwest that I knew and called home. ... I felt a deepening
sadness and anger that this was so. I felt a grief that was very real for
the losses my particular ecosystem had incurred. </p>

<p>I also felt another kind of anguish, something even more profound because
it gnawed at the only thing that remedies grief. Hope. I felt a sort of
vast hopelessness. I saw clearly the spiral we are spinning down in the
Columbia River Watershed. The power of the &quot;extinction of experience&quot;
as naturalist Robert Pyle calls it. How a generation or two has already
grown up in the Columbia Basin without the fish. And without the fish,
the wild fish, in great numbers, there is no experience of the power of
Salmon. In a very short time we will learn to live without them. When we
no longer encounter them they will be outside of our perception and we
will not be able to care. Not from our hearts, which is the place that
births action. What an impoverished world it will be without the salmon
... not only will the streams, soils and other creatures that depend on
the salmon lose but our spirits will lose. We will have severed one more
cord that binds us to the universe as a whole and we will be flailing.
We will be poor. </p>

<h2>&quot;I can spread the word&quot;<a name="spread"></a> </h2>

mobility people from far away can provide useful support to local efforts.
</i></p>

<p>In the fall of 1995 I made my first journey to the Pacific Northwest
to make a video documentary on salmon. I found the land so beautiful, wild
and majestic. In the markets I would pick up real estate magazines thinking
what a great place this would be to live. </p>

<p>While walking through some of the remaining 5% of old growth forests
I came upon a small path. I walked this path cautiously, not knowing where
it was going or why I felt compelled to follow it. With care, I lifted
fallen boughs to pass the places blocked, and stepped gently on the sandy
soil leading down to the riverbank. When I reached the river I found, caught
on fallen branches, a dead salmon. It was mottled in color and about a
foot and a half long. I felt certain that this fish was one of the lucky
few to complete its destiny and return to procreate in its home waters.
It was such a moving site, especially for me who had never before been
a part of the wonderful cycle of salmon. </p>

<p>At that moment I felt so much a part of that forest and river. Not small
and insignificant like the majesty of nature can sometimes make one feel,
but truly a piece of the whole, not any less significant than the grains
of sandy soil beneath my feet. I knew then that I was only meant to share
this moment and savor it in my memory. I was not meant to come and live
in this great land, for it is populated by humans enough. </p>

<p>That salmon told me the story that it belonged here, with the peoples
who had coexisted with it for thousands of years; but I did not belong
here. My culture would encourage me to have a job, drive my car to work
and buy my food in a grocery store: I would not be helping the salmon in
this way. I can advocate from a long way away. I can spread the word of
healthy Northwest rivers full of salmon, eagles and bears. And I can remember
the beauty of that salmon in my dreams.</p>

<h2>Suggestions for Fishermen Involved with Salmon Habitat Restoration</h2>

<p><a name="suggestions"></a><i>By Paul Merz </i></p>

<p><i>Editor's Note: The following is excerpted from observations that
fisherman and restoration worker Merz wrote up during work on the Lower
Coquille Riparian Restoration Project in 1995. Merz emphasizes that they
are &quot;not a set of rules,&quot; and he advises his fisherman/ restoration
colleagues to &quot;use whatever information that fits your project and
file the rest.&quot; Merz's modest, practical notes are an example of the
kind of useful information that's being generated and circulated as the
result of on-the-ground watershed work. </i></p>

<h3>Build a Personal Relationship with Landowners </h3>

<p>Develop a trust with them, and respect their opinions and rights to
manage their own lands. Not all experts are &quot;ologists&quot; and not
all &quot;ologists&quot; are experts. Some of the most important project
information will come from landowners. These people can often provide site
specific information about land use practices and stream conditions going
back several generations. </p>

<p>Ask landowners if they think their neighbors might be interested in
the work being done. One cooperating landowner can help &quot;sell&quot;
the project to neighbors. </p>

<p>Try to get individuals and families to take ownership of restoration
work done on their land. Ask them for advice during project planning (plant
species, fence types, etc.). </p>

<p>Greater public awareness and involvement will lead to more far reaching
and economical projects. Ask cooperating landowners to help spread the
word about projects. Use the media but make certain they have correct information
and present it properly. Try to develop &quot;community ownership&quot;
in projects. Never turn down volunteer help, especially from landowners.
</p>

<h3>Respect Current Land Use Practices, but Offer Alternatives </h3>

<p>If livestock are using a stream, develop an alternative water source.
</p>

<p>When doing fencing and planting projects, be willing to trade some off
site work (clearing, fencing, water systems) for the right to plant and
fence a strip of currently productive pasture or hay field in the riparian
area. </p>

<p>Don't try to showcase any particular site. Money and time spent trying
to create a parklike setting is better spent expanding the project. Set
some standards and maintain them throughout the project.</p>

<p>Don't commit to something you can't deliver. </p>

<p>Keep good records of all time and materials used to accomplish a project.
Landowner's time spent on the project should be figured at the going rate
as technical assistance, and use of landowner equipment at the cost to
rent the same equipment. Almost all time and money spent on a project can
be used to leverage more funding to expand the project or start a new one.
</p>

<h3>You Can't &quot;Just Do It&quot;</h3>

<p>Learn to play the politics. With most projects there are quite a few
hoops to jump through, and everyone involved has their own agenda and priorities
concerning habitat work. </p>

<p>Remember that most projects require a funding source, and some type
of permit, and money usually has strings attached. </p>

<p>If you are working with grant money, once the planning is done and field
work has progressed to a point that it is safe to say the project will
be a success, several people from far away offices, who had something to
do with generating the funding will show up with the news media, ask a
few questions and make a brief statement for the cameras proclaiming their
project a great success and a shining example of what can be accomplished
with cooperation from the local people. There will be a round of thanks
to a long list of agencies and people whose names you've never heard before,
and at that point, the person speaking will rush off to catch a plane,
with media in tow. </p>

<p>Don't get frustrated. Remember that the man with the money makes the
rules. We are really working for the fish and fish don't care who does
the work. If we do our present jobs well, we can all go back to our real
jobs. Good fishing. </p>

<h2>Salmon Speak: A Parable for Humans </h2>

<p><a name="parable"></a><i>By Johnny Sundstrom </i></p>

coordinator of the Siuslaw Institute, a director of the Siuslaw Soil and
Water Conservation District, and a facilitator of the Deadwood Creek CRMP
Organization. His copyrighted &quot;parable for humans&quot; is excerpted
below. </i></p>

<p>And it came to pass during the time of the Great Emergency, during the
final migrations of the Second Millennium (1994-1999), that the COUNCIL
of all SALMON convened a Conference. To this gathering, they invited migration
managers, resource agency personnel, and the senior scientists of the Salmon
Nations to address these Questions: &quot;To what do we owe our sudden
demise, in numbers as well as in importance?&quot; and &quot;What is to
be done?&quot; </p>

<p>The Conference took the form of a hearing, and testimony was presented
over the course of several days and nights. What follows is a brief summary
of the proceedings and presentations. </p>

<center><p>* * </p></center>

<p><i>Sixth Speaker:</i> &quot;All of the aforementioned causes are real
and could be dealt with were we to be given the opportunity to survive
that other species have been given, both by the humans and by the laws
of Nature. But, there is another source of our distress and that is, we
are in danger of being helped to death. Competing and conflicting human
institutions, agencies and organizations all act as if their truth is the
only truth and they prevent one another from being effective or even experimental.
Look at the situation on the Columbia with the dams, the environmental
vs. economic debates, fishing allocations, the failure to develop a way
of utilizing hatchery production so that it doesn't destroy our genetic
potential, all of these and many more areas of struggle define the human
approach to saving us, and we may be just as doomed by competing Programs
as we are by thoughtless Progress.&quot; </p>

<p>Finally, as the Conference moved into its final hour, the oldest Salmon
of them all eased toward the Speakers' platform and asked for the attention
of those who had already spoken and all of those who had been listening.
</p>

<p><i>Oldest Speaker:</i> &quot;Thank you for this opportunity to speak
with you. I have listened to what has gone before and I hope what I say
will be of use. You have presented our populations with an impressive and
overwhelming catalog of causes for what is happening to us. Some of these,
such as those of the sky and the earth, of the ocean and the climate, we
can do little about. But those causes alone have never resulted in what
is happening now. We must continue to live and to pray and to do our best
to do our part to survive these major phenomena affecting our future. </p>

<p>&quot;The other things you have identified all have a common origin,
as well as something else which ties them together. They originate in the
way of life of the humans, and what ties them together is that if we cannot
influence these changes we will not go on. This is why I think that we
have not yet seriously addressed the question of &quot;What is to be Done?&quot;
I would like to try. </p>

<p>&quot;First, we must have compassion for the humans. They're limited
by their vision. These days they can only see with their eyes, so they
can only see what is in front of their faces. Imagine not being able to
see both banks of the river without constantly turning your head from side
to side, or on the other hand, having no idea what is beside you because
you can't turn away from what's ahead. Because of this, and because they
have lost the memory of how to live, of how to be at home in a place, we
must help them. We must reach them and teach them what we know, and there
is no time to delay. It is truly now or never.</p>

<p>&quot;How is this to be done? I feel I must remind us all that we are
both species and spirit! In times past the humans recognized us in both
our forms and we lived in both of the worlds of this existence. Now, the
spirit world is neglected, and we too have begun to forget our power, to
blame conditions and others for our fate, to ignore the responsibility
we have for those whose lives are bound to ours. We must restore our selves
so that we can communicate with those who can restore our habitat, our
cycles and our productivity. </p>

<p>&quot;We must send messengers and messages. We must use our power of
spirit to save our species and all of those who depend on us. </p>

<p>&quot;We must impress the humans with the truth that in the times to
come we are the only ones who can save each other from extinction. We are
inseparable in this place. It has always been so, and so it will always
be, as long as there are salmon, as long as there are humans...&quot;</p>

<h2>A Stage Play About Salmon and People <a name="play"></a></h2>

<p><i>Editor's Note: The following speech opens the popular &quot;musical
comedy for people of several species,&quot; Queen Salmon. Written by David
Simpson with assistance from the cast of the play, Queen Salmon has been
performed numerous times in recent years, last making an extended tour
of northern California, Oregon, and Washington in fall 1994. The performing
group, called Human Nature, makes their home in the Mattole Valley of northern
California, where, they write, &quot;we have been working as a community
since 1976 to rescue our Chinook and Coho salmon runs from extinction.&quot;</i></p>

<p><i>About the play, they say, &quot;Hopefully, there is in it information
and inspiration that can be translated to have meaning for you, your watershed,
and community.&quot; </i></p>

<p><i>The dramatic opening speech of Queen Salmon herself is a good sample
of that inspiration.</i> </p>

<h3>Act I, Prologue: Spirit of Salmon's Lament </h3>

<p><b><i>(Female Spirit in shimmering gown and cape, undulating gently,
enters) </i></b></p>

<p>We were so many once. The sea itself would churn with the wake of our
endless schools. When we turned, in our great gyres, the head of the school
would be half way down to Kodiak while our tail would still be deep in
Siberian waters, pecked at by Aleut hunters brave enough to pursue us in
flimsy skin boats. </p>

<p>From frigid Kamchatka to the balmy southern coasts, we were known as
providers, who guaranteed meat to bear and eagle, and raven and human and
a multitude of others. </p>

<p>When we entered the rivers, compelled by the sacred, fatal urgings of
our loins, a huge wave preceded us to let the hunters know we were coming.
The rivers swelled and the fishermen roared with glee at our spirit churning
the water to foam. </p>

<p>We were royalty visiting from a larger, more exotic realm, charging
each valley from Siberia to Point Conception with the power of the deep,
and the exaltation of purest sex. </p>

<p>And when that was over, our carcasses sent to the peaks a stench that
sickened even the skunk people but spoke of oceanic riches being returned
to the rivers, and the land, to put spine in the green growth and recharge
the cycle of life. We were the mortar and thong that bound river and ocean,
land and sea. We were the Lifebringers. </p>

<h2>Sustainable Fisheries Focus Attention <a name="sustainable"></a></h2>

<p><i>Editor's Note: A few hundred scientists, policy makers, fishermen,
and other concerned citizens from the United States and Canada met in Victoria,
B.C., at the end of April for a Sustainable Fisheries Conference. The conference,
hosted by the Sustainable Fisheries Foundation and the North Pacific International
Chapter of the American Fisheries Society, was intended &quot;to increase
public awareness of the importance of, and imminent need for, a sustainable
fisheries strategy to support the protection and restoration of west coast
salmon and steelhead populations.&quot; </i></p>

<p><i>One key element of this conference was the importance attached to
producing a written coastwide strategy, developed by the attendees. Restoration
will report on the strategy when it is published. Meanwhile, in the spirit
of &quot;increasing public awareness&quot; about restoration issues throughout
salmon country we publish here a small number of summaries (abstracts)
of talks given during the conference. These particular talks were among
those which offered a variety of insights and views not readily encountered
outside this meeting. </i></p>

<p><i>They relate to a serious salmon problem in British Columbia, where
the number of stocks at risk exceeds that of the Columbia Basin; a need
for better international monitoring of salmon stocks; a review of salmon
management lessons from the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Oregon
Department of Fish and Wildlife; a restoration success story by the Forest
Service; and an intriguing perspective on salmon resilience over geological
time. </i></p>

<h3><a name="BCstocks"></a>Status of British Columbia Salmon Stocks </h3>

<p><i>North Pacific International Chapter-American Fisheries Society/*Aquatic
Resources Limited, Vancouver, BC </i></p>

<p>A summary database on the status of salmon stocks (genus Oncorhynchus)
from British Columbia and Yukon streams was assembled from fisheries agency
databases and files. Supplementary information was collected by circulating
the database among fisheries professionals and interest groups throughout
British Columbia. A total of 9662 anadromous salmon stocks was identified.
They included 866 chinook, l625 chum, 2594 coho, 2169 pink, 917 sockeye,
867 steelhead and 612 cutthroat trout stocks. The status of anadromous
stocks was assessed by employing a classification scheme similar to that
of Nehlsen et al. ( 1991). Assessments were possible for 5487 or 57% of
all stocks. <b>This included 624 at high risk, 78 at moderate risk, 230
of special concern and 142 stocks extinguished in this century.</b> Many
potential threats are identified for anadromous salmon stocks; however
the absence of systematic, high quality assessments at the biological stock
level precludes reliable assignment of the specific causes for many of
the stocks apparently at risk. </p>

<h3>A Review of the Effects <a name="effects"></a>of the Endangered Species
Act on Harvest Management and Implications for the Future </h3>

<p><i>Peter Dygert </i></p>

<p><i>National Marine Fisheries Service, Seattle, WA </i></p>

<p>Recent listings of Pacific salmon under the Endangered Species Act (ESA)
have had a direct effect on U.S. ocean fisheries and those in the Columbia
and Sacramento river basins. Allowable catches in mixed stock fisheries
have been reduced although the impacts in most cases have been less than
they might have been because of the depressed status of unlisted chinook
and coho stocks. The demands of the ESA consultation process for listed
species has required a substantial reallocation of management resources
to the detriment of what could be a more comprehensive effort focusing
on the needs of wild stocks. However, the recent salmon listings have brought
to the forefront weak stock management issues and provided a necessary
catalyst that has forced users and managers to deal more directly with
the conservation needs of depressed wild stocks and the associated implications
for fishery management. Salmon fishery management is in a period of transition.
<b>Current management objectives remain focused on maximizing harvest of
more abundant and productive natural and hatchery &quot;driver&quot; stocks.
These objectives are not compatible with maintaining the viability of less
productive wild stocks throughout their range.</b> </p>

<p>Current discussions related to sustainable fisheries must address this
conflict in management priorities. The key is to reconsider through a systematic
review which stocks should be designated for explicit management protection.
This could be accomplished by compiling a comprehensive list of local breeding
units which would then be aggregated into management units based first
on biological similarities and secondarily on available data. Managers
and other interested parties would then have to decide which stocks to
designate for management protection. Once the management objectives are
defined, fisheries could be designed that are compatible with the needs
of the designated stocks. If management priorities are changed in favor
of maintaining a greater diversity of wild stocks we should expect that
the resulting fisheries will be very different from those existing today.
</p>

<h3>A Call<a name="Call"></a> for an International Coastwide Stock Status
Tracking Program </h3>

<p><i>Willa Nehlsen </i></p>

<p><i>Nehlsen Associates, Portland OR </i></p>

<p>In the past decade only two research teams have documented the status
of Pacific salmon on large scale bases: Konkel and Mclntyre (US Fish and
Wildlife Service) in 1987, and Nehlsen, Williams and Lichatowich (American
Fisheries Society) in 1991. Since then, efforts to track the status of
salmon at the state and province level have improved, but t<b>here still
is no joint large-scale program to monitor the status of salmon stocks
consistently over time.</b> As salmon continue to decline across large
portions of their range, and recovery programs are implemented, large-scale
long-term assessment is critical to advancing salmon conservation and tracking
the success of conservation programs. A joint US/Canada program is needed
that uses common criteria, accounts for qualitative data, interprets large
scale and long-term trends and their likely causes, and provides access
to the public. </p>

<h3>Oregon Coastal Coho Salmon--A Management Case Study <a name="casestudy"></a></h3>

<p><i>Doug DeHart </i></p>

<p><i>Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife </i></p>

<p>Historically, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were numerous in the
small drainages of coastal Oregon and Washington. The numbers of this species
have declined significantly in recent years. Tracing the dynamics of Oregon
coastal coho, the habitats which support them, and the fisheries which
have utilized this species offers a thought-provoking case study of management
methods used by natural resource agencies. </p>

<p>Early in the century this species was less frequently sought in bay
and river fisheries than the larger chinook salmon. The rise of sport and
commercial ocean troll fisheries placed more harvest pressure on this species.
Initially this fishery was largely self regulating. Later declines in catch
were countered by the development of an extensive hatchery system. This
approach initially appeared successful but cyclic decline in ocean survival
and growth resulted in additional periods of declining catch and river
returns. Fishery managers reacted by setting an escapement objective for
Oregon Coastal Natural (OCN) coho in aggregate. Recent declines in adult
returns have called into question this approach to assessing abundance
and setting escapement objectives. <b>This review identifies some inherent
failures in the ability of management programs to detect and respond to
biological problems in a timely way. Recent experience also suggests that
salmon management in degraded habitats can not rely on tools and strategies
developed during periods of higher productivity. </b></p>

<h3>Watershed Restoration <a name="restoration"></a>in Deer Creek, Washington--A
Ten Year Review </h3>

<p><i>James Doyle, Michelle Fisher, Greta Movassaghi, and Roger Nichols
</i></p>

<p><i>U.S. Forest Service, Mt. Baker Snoqualmie National Forest </i></p>

<p>Deer Creek is a tributary to the North Fork Stillaguamish River in northwest
Washington State. Approximately two thirds of the watershed is in federal
ownership. Deer Creek once supported one of the largest populations of
native, wild summer-run steelhead in the Pacific Northwest, and also provided
habitat for coho salmon and native char populations. Concentrated timber
management activities on landslide-prone areas throughout the watershed
and the occurrence of a number of major storm events over the past 30-40
years have been the major reason for the loss or degradation of aquatic
habitat and a subsequent decline and near extinction of the native fish
populations. </p>

<p>Since the early 1980's major landslides and flood events have dropped
these anadromous fish populations to critical levels of viability. Beginning
in 1984, Deer Creek has been the focus for comprehensive watershed planning
and restoration. All landowners began to coordinate short- and long-term
timber harvesting operations within the watershed; at this time the US
Forest Service deferred further timber harvesting in Deer Creek due to
the critical decline in fish populations and the loss of fish habitat.
<b>Watershed restoration was initiated on federal land in 1984 with the
goal of restoring the watershed's physical and biological processes that
formed and maintained the favorable aquatic habitat conditions of the past.</b>
Initial restoration project emphasis was to reduce the occurrence of mass
soil movement (landslides and debris torrents) from logging roads, old
harvest units, and naturally unstable areas. Another phase of restoration
work occurring at the same time was upgrading and stormproofing the existing
road system. The second stage of work was restoring structure to the stream
channel network with the goal of controlling the bedload transport and
deposition as well as streambank stability.</p>

<p>In FY 1994 ... both a federal and a state &quot;jobs for the woods&quot;
restoration program was put into action in this watershed. <b>Preliminary
assessments of watershed damage resulting from two large flood events in
Nov 1995 show that 10 years of comprehensive watershed restoration and
hydrologic recovery in Deer Creek has protected critical aquatic habitat
and prevented major road and landslide failures.</b> </p>

<h3>Taking the Long View<a name="longview"></a>: Geologic, Paleontological
and Archaeological Evidence of Salmon Population Dynamics During the Holocene
</h3>

<p><i>James C. Chatters </i></p>

<p><i>Applied Paleoscience, Richland, WA </i></p>

<p>In assessing the status of salmon stocks in the Pacific Northwest, we
tend to use early nineteenth century values as the long-term historic norm
and to see potential fish productivity as virtually static. When geologic,
paleontological, and archaeological evidence are used to extend our record
of productivity in the Columbia, Fraser, and Sacramento systems, however,
the dynamic and resilient character of the salmon resource becomes evident.
</p>

<p>First, during the late Pleistocene, the entire Fraser and most of the
Columbia above the Snake River were foreclosed to salmon by glacial ice.
Salmon recolonized those systems by at least 9000 B.C. in the Columbia
and 7000 B.C. in the Fraser. Habitat conditions remained poor, however,
through the early and middle Holocene in all three systems. Combinations
of eroding glacial deposits, aggrading beds, low flows, abbreviated freshets,
and warmer waters kept salmon populations at levels closer to those of
today than to the early 19th century. A reversal of these conditions between
1700 and 2300 B.C., probably combined with improved oceanic conditions,
enabled an explosion in salmon populations. Native peoples in all river
systems reorganized their subsistence pursuits around the salmon runs at
this time. As human populations rose over the next several millennia, there
is evidence in the Sacramento and perhaps also the Columbia River of stress
on the salmon resource. This reached its highest levels after 500 A.D.
Salmon habitat also fluctuated in recent centuries. In the 18th century,
epidemics destroyed native human populations, relaxing predation pressure.
At the same time, the cooling of the Little Ice Age may have improved climatic
conditions in southern parts of the salmon's range. <b>As a consequence
of three historic coincidences -- European exploration, native American
depopulation, and climate-induced habitat enhancement -- our 19th century
baseline is far from the long-term norm. </b></p>

<h3>Researchers Identify Priority Questions </h3>

<h2>Salmon's Salt Water Survival Poorly Understood<a name="survival"></a></h2>

<p><i>By Pat Kight </i></p>

<p>The survival of salmon -- and other marine fish -- may hinge on large-scale,
little-understood shifts in climate and ocean that span decades or longer,
many scientists are beginning to believe. </p>

<p>But absence of long-term data makes it hard to understand the complex
interplay of air, water and living things that may contribute to the ups
and downs of marine and anadromous fish, including salmon. </p>

<p>A call to begin systematically recording, collecting and analyzing such
data was a central theme of a gathering in March of more than 100 scientists,
from fishery biologists to oceanographers and atmospheric scientists, who
met to compare notes on research related to salmon survival. </p>

<p>Sponsored by the National Marine Fisheries Service and Oregon State
University's Hatfield Marine Science Center, the three-day gathering was
titled &quot;Estuarine and Ocean Survival of Northeastern Pacific Salmon.&quot;
</p>

<p>As the title implied, the meeting focused on those phases of salmonids'
lives which are less evident, and less well-researched, than the time they
spend in fresh-water rivers and streams. Salmon spend days, perhaps weeks,
in the mixed fresh- and salt-water estuaries while their bodies adjust
to the change in water chemistry. Then they head out to sea, where they
live and feed for one or more years before returning to the rivers to spawn
and die. The fresh-water segment of the fishes' life cycle has received
much of the scientific and political attention in the continuing effort
to understand the salmon and try to forestall the rapid decline of many
wild stocks. But less is known about what happens to the fish in estuaries
and at sea. </p>

<h4>Pieces of the Puzzle </h4>

<p>Researchers at the Newport meeting listened -- and debated -- avidly
as their colleagues laid out pieces of the puzzle: </p>

<ul>
<li>Hints about predation, and the role other specie -- fish, bird and
mammal -- may play in reducing or increasing salmon runs.</li>

<li>Suggestions that the different environments where salmon live out their
live -- _stream, estuary and ocean -- play very different and not well-understood
parts in the species' survival.</li>

<li>Repeated indications that large-scale shifts in ocean climate and temperature
play an even larger role than previously suspected in the fishes' survival
during their critical years at sea. One such &quot;regime shift&quot; in
the late 1970s is believed to have contributed both to record high salmon
catches in Alaska, and near disaster conditions for some stocks off Oregon,
Washington and California.</li>
</ul>

<p>Understanding such large-scale, long-term events, many participants
said, may be the key to fishery stock predictions, fishery management decisions
and fish restoration strategies. </p>

<p>In all, two dozen scientists summarized research which most said had
barely scratched the surface of what there is to learn about long- and
short-term factors in salmon survival. </p>

<p>Participants repeatedly expressed frustration over the lack of long-term
data about ocean and climate conditions, and urged establishment of a regional
committee to coordinate at-sea research to fill those information gaps.
</p>

<p>They also agreed that several questions need immediate research attention,
among them: </p>

<ul>
<li>How have changes in the distribution and abundance of predators and
prey affect ocean salmon distribution?</li>

<li>Where in the ocean do different stocks reside, and what factors influence
their growth and survival</li>

<li>How have large-scale hatchery releases affected the carrying capacity
of estuary and ocean habitats</li>

<li>How, in particular, do salmon fare in each of their three distinct
habitats_stream, estuary and ocean -- and why? Does the answer change over
time and space? </li>
</ul>

<h2>Sustainability Focus of Coast Conference<a name="coastcon"></a></h2>

<p>The future of the Oregon coast, its human communities and the environments
in which they live will be the focus of a two-day June conference called
<a href="../coastcon.html">Sustaining Oregon's Coast and Communities: Issues
and Opportunities. </a></p>

<p>The meeting, June 6-7 at the Hotel Newport, is being organized by Oregon
Sea Grant, the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development,
and the Oregon Coastal Zone Management Association. </p>

<p>Participants are expected to include community leaders, researchers
and coastal government officials. Residents of the coast are invited to
attend.</p>

<p>The organizing groups hope the conference will create a forum for discussing
emerging issues concerning the coast, its people, and the prospects for
the region's future. Among other things, they are hoping participants can
help define the term &quot;sustainability,&quot; as it relates to the communities,
the environment and the special qualities of Oregon's coast. </p>

<p>The first day will include presentations and discussion concerning:</p>

<ul>
<li>People and the Oregon coast, including the region's history, demographics,

<h2>Three state efforts address coastal salmon<a name="stateprograms"></a></h2>

<p>Some readers of Restoration are involved in one or more of three major
salmon planning activities underway in Oregon, under the auspices of state
government. Other Oregonians are perhaps not aware of the three activities
-- two created by the last Legislature, one by Governor Kitzhaber -- or
of how they differ. </p>

<p>The information below, condensed from a table prepared by Jay Rasmussen,
executive director of the Oregon Coastal Zone Management Association, may
help.</p>

<p>Briefly, Senate Bill 1127 established a task force which was charged
with developing a &quot;fisheries-sustaining&quot; coastal salmonid restoration
and production strategy based on established scientific principles, studies
and available data. </p>

<p>House Bill 2615 stated the need to &quot;review all options and means
for the protection and restoration of Oregon's salmon resource that promote
local economic development and enjoyment by all the citizens of Oregon.&quot;
The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife is responsible for most of the
work associated with this bill. </p>

<p>Finally, the governor began a Coastal Salmon Restoration Initiative,
&quot;focused on preserving and restoring native coastal salmon populations
and preventing the need for a federal threatened or endangered listing
of coho salmon under the Endangered Species Act.&quot; </p>

<h2><A name="intro"></h2>
<p><strong>Introduction to Special Section on
<em>Upstream</em></strong>, by <em>Restoration</em> editor Joseph Cone
<p>"Science weighs in on salmon fate," trumpeted the page one headline 
of the Oregonian on November 9. "A long-awaited scientific report on 
Pacific salmon warns_" began the article, which then listed the warnings 
and underscored the credibility of the organization that presented them.
<p>Indeed, the reason that this latest report on salmon received 
substantial, positive coverage in the news media late last year, 
and the reason Restoration is devoting a significant portion of this 
quarterly issue to the report, is its source, <a href="http://www.nas.edu/nrc/#NRC">the National Research 
Council.</a> The council was founded in 1916 as the research arm 
of the <a href="http://www.nas.edu/">National Academy of Sciences,</a> an organization of the most 
eminent scientists in the United States. It was designed to provide 
advice to the government, specifically to Congress.
<p>
What gives the council's pronouncements generally more credibility 
than other reports is the council's reputation for impartial, thorough, 
carefully reviewed, and up-to-date work. The reports themselves are 
prepared by committees of invited scientists, primarily academics.
When the council's salmon report, Upstream: Salmon and Society in the 
Pacific Northwest, was released in November, it was greeted by generally 
positive news stories and favorable comments from those awaiting the study. 
No reception was more favorable than that from Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield: 
"The verdict is in. The National Academy of Sciences -  'the Supreme Court of 
Science' - says that it is time to implement an honest, science-based 
approach to salmon recovery."
<p>It's our concern, however, that few readers of Restoration have seen 
this salmon report itself, and probably fewer still have read the entire 
400-page document. In our limited space we thought we could help readers 
become better acquainted with the report and with some of the reactions 
to it. Whether Upstream is really the last word on salmon restoration_which 
appears unlikely_it will certainly be referred to and used to support 
various actions, just because of who produced it.
<p>We have assembled three articles:
<ul><li>highlights from the executive summary of the report
<li>perspective on <em>Upstream</em> and solving the salmon problem by 
those involved in the report
<li>comments by a variety of observers on the quality and significance 
of the report</ul>

<h3>The Salmon Problem</h3>
<p>The salmon problem is the decline of wild salmon runs 
and the reductions in abundance of salmon even after massive 
investments in hatcheries. The declines - largely a result of human 
impacts on the environment caused by activities such as forestry, 
agriculture, grazing, industrial activities, urbanization, dams, 
hatcheries, and fishing - are widespread, although not universal ...
<h3>General Conclusion</h3>
<p>To achieve long-term protection for a diversity and abundance 
of salmon in the Pacific Northwest, two general goals must be achieved:
<ul><li>The long-term survival of salmon depends crucially on a 
diverse and rich store of genetic variation. Because of their homing 
behavior and the distribution of their populations and their riverine 
habitats, salmon populations are unusually susceptible to local extinctions 
and are dependent on diversity in their genetic make-up and population 
structure. Therefore, management must recognize and protect the 
genetic diversity within each salmon species, and it must recognize 
and work with local breeding populations and their habitats. It is 
not enough to focus only on the abundance of salmon.
<li>The social structures and institutions that have been operating 
in the Pacific Northwest have proved incapable of ensuring a long-term 
future for salmon, in large part because they do not operate at the
 right time and space scales. [D]ifferences among watersheds mean that 
different approaches are likely to be appropriate and effective in different 
watersheds, even where the goals are the same. This means that 
institutions must be able to operate at the scale of watersheds; 
in addition, a coordinating function is needed to make sure that 
larger perspectives are considered.
</ul>
<p>As a framework in which to approach its deliberations, the committee 
chose to focus on rehabilitation - a pragmatic approach that relies on 
natural regenerative processes in the long term and the selected use 
of technology and human effort in the short term - rather than on attempts 
to restore the landscape to some pristine former state and rather than on 
a primary reliance on substitution, i.e., the use of technologies and energy 
inputs, such as hatcheries, artificial transportation, and modification of 
stream channels. Rehabilitation would protect what remains in an ecosystem 
and encourage natural regenerative processes.
<p>The solutions will not be easy or inexpensive to implement; even a 
holding action to prevent further declines will require large commitments 
of time and money from many people in many segments of society in the 
Pacific Northwest. Therefore, broad-based societal decisions are needed 
to successfully provide a long-term future for natural salmon populations.
<h3>Environmental Factors</h3>
<p>... Recently, natural environmental conditions in the Pacific Northwest 
appear to have been unfavorable to salmon production. As changes continue 
to occur, environmental conditions will probably favor salmon and lead to 
larger runs in some areas for a time, even without human intervention. 
If such changes do occur, they should be regarded as providing time to 
develop better strategies for rehabilitation of salmon populations. They 
should not be used as reasons for abandoning efforts to rehabilitate 
salmon, for they will surely be followed by other natural changes. 
Inappropriate short-term responses to large-scale environmental changes 
at sea or on land should be avoided, because there can be long lags between 
causes and effects ...
<h3>Hatcheries</h3>
<p>... Hatchery planning, management, and operations should be changed so 
that their goals are to assist recovery of wild populations and to increase 
knowledge about salmon. As described above and in many parts of this 
report . . . precautions must be taken to protect the genetic diversity 
and ecological productivity of naturally spawning populations of salmon. 
Those precautions will include an overall decrease in hatchery-fish 
production and - over the short term - in fishing opportunities. The basic 
guideline is to ensure that any hatchery production for fishing is 
not detrimental to natural populations ...
<h3>Fishing</h3>
<p>... In general, the serious declines of wild salmon populations show that 
not enough fish are being allowed to return to spawn. The number of fish 
returning to spawn (escapements) must be substantially increased to conserve 
genetic diversity within and between demes [a local population of closely 
related organisms - Ed.], use available habitats, rehabilitate ecological 
processes (including the return of nutrients to aquatic ecosystems), and 
increase the sustainable production of salmon. Increasing escapements will 
disrupt fisheries, industry, and communities, but it is necessary for 
restoring production. As salmon abundance increases and fisheries begin 
operating at lower, but sustainable, catch rates, actual catches will 
gradually increase, although probably not to the sizes of some historical 
catches, because those were based on excessive catch rates. Implementing 
this recommendation will initially require low fishing effort in many areas, 
especially in the ocean, and it will require cooperation from British 
Columbia and Alaska, because many salmon that originate in the Pacific
 Northwest are caught at sea in British Columbia and southeastern Alaska.
<h3>Institutional Change</h3>
<p> ...Because we often do not know what the effects of a management option 
will be, management must be undertaken with an experimental, adaptive point 
of view. Flexibility must be built into institutional structures to allow 
for changes in management practices based on experience. Institutions must 
allow and encourage refocusing the energies of salmon management to recognize
 the importance of demes in maintaining genetic processes and to maintain 
and expand their diversity. The goal of management should be to achieve a 
biologically sound escapement (instead of focusing on a "sustainable" or 
permissible catch) for each metapopulation and an explicit adoption of time 
scales for management and planning that are commensurate with the multiyear 
scale of salmon life cycles.
<p>Beyond those facilitating changes, the formal institutions that manage 
salmon need to be restructured or refocused to reflect three important 
institutional principles. First, decision making authority should be 
shared among all legitimate interests (cooperative management); 
legitimate interests that are excluded from decision-making are likely 
to block desirable changes. Second, the organizational structures 
and decision-making processes should allow for local conditions and 
variations and the management strategies should vary accordingly. Third, 
systematic learning using appropriate experimental designs (adaptive 
management) should be an essential goal.
<p>As a first step, the relevant agencies in the Pacific Northwest, 
including the National Marine Fisheries Service, should agree on a 
process to permit the formulation of salmon recovery plans in advance of 
listings under the Endangered Species Act, and the Pacific Northwest states, 
acting individually and through the Northwest Power Planning 
Council, should provide technical and financial assistance to watershed-level
 organizations to prepare and implement these preemptive recovery plans
...
<h3>An Approach to Solving the Problem</h3>
<p>The salmon problem took many years to develop, and its solution will 
require the commitment of considerable time, money, and effort. 
The committee's analyses of the problems and potential solutions lead to 
the conclusion that there is no "magic bullet." Therefore, like the
 problem itself, solutions will be complex and often hard to agree on; to be 
successful, they will need to be based on scientific information, including 
information provided by social and economic sciences. In addition, to be 
successful, consensus will be needed about the size of the investments to 
be made in solving the problem and how the costs should be allocated. This 
means that solutions will have to be regionally based, just as the salmon 
problem has regional variations. The committee recommends the following 
general approach. For each major watershed or river basin, the following 
should be assessed:
<ul><li>All causes of salmon mortality, including their estimated magnitude 
and the uncertainties associated with the estimates. Factors known to 
decrease natural production should also be listed.
<li>Ways of reducing those sources of mortality or compensating for them, 
their probable effectiveness, and their drawbacks.
<li>The probable costs of each method of reducing mortality. To be most 
useful, the estimates should include both market and nonmarket costs. To 
the degree possible, it is important to identify what societal groups would 
bear the major portion of the costs of each method and significant 
uncertainties in the estimates. (For example, reductions in catch rates 
would primarily affect fishers and tourists; changes in water use 
could affect agricultural interests or ratepayers; changes in riparian 
management could affect forest-products industries or private
landowners.)</ul>
<p>All the estimates would include substantial uncertainties, due both to 
lack of knowledge and to fundamental environmental, socioeconomic, and 
biological uncertainties. Nonetheless, such a process of assessment 
and evaluation is essential for rational decision making. They will provide 
a basis for evaluating options -  for weighing benefits and costs -  and for 
identifying areas where research is critical. <em>All the recommendations 
in this report should be viewed in this context: they need to be considered 
on a regional basis (i.e., major watersheds) and in a comprehensive framework
 that includes an analysis of their costs, probable effectiveness, and 
the ability and willingness of various sectors to bear the costs. . .
.</em>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>The best approach to establishing a sustainable future for salmon in the 
Pacific Northwest is to use currently available information to develop 
workable, comprehensive programs rather than reacting to crises.
<hr>
<h2>NRC Describes Status of Salmon</h2>
<blockquote><ul><li><em>Pacific salmon have disappeared from about 40% of their 
historical breeding ranges in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California 
over the last century, and many remaining populations are severely depressed
 in areas where they were formerly abundant.</em> If the areas in which 
salmon are threatened or endangered are added to the areas where they are 
now extinct, the total area with losses is two-thirds of their previous 
range in the four states.
<li><em>Coastal populations tend to be somewhat better off than populations 
inhabiting interior drainages.</em>
<li><em>Populations near the southern boundary of species' ranges tend to be 
at greater risk than northern populations.</em> In general, proportionately 
fewer healthy populations exist in California and Oregon than in Washington 
and British Columbia. The reasons for this trend are complex and appear to 
be related to both ocean conditions and human activities.
<li><em>Species with extended freshwater rearing (up to a year) - such as 
spring/summer chinook, coho, sockeye, sea-run cutthroat, and steelhead - 
are generally extinct, endangered, or threatened over a greater percentage 
of their ranges than species with abbreviated freshwater residence, such as 
fall chinook, chum, and pink salmon.</em>
<li><em>In many cases, populations that are not smaller than they used to be 
are now composed largely or entirely of hatchery fish.</em> An overall 
estimate of the proportion of hatchery fish is not available, but several 
regional  estimates make clear that many runs depend mainly or entirely on 
hatcheries.</ul></blockquote>
<p>-- from <em>Upstream</em>
<hr>
<h2><a name="perspectives">Perspectives from Upstream's
Producers</a></h2>
<p><em>Editor's Note: 
<p>Restoration asked several members of the Upstream committee to reconsider 
all that they had learned from the three years of the committee's work and 
from their own experience with the salmon problem and to distill that 
information. We asked them to frame brief comments about this complex 
problem in a way that other people could easily relate to. Specifically, 
we said,
<blockquote>It may be useful to regard the salmon problem just like many 
other complicated ones we encounter in daily life. Generically, you want 
to solve a problem that can't be solved by you alone, but requires others. 
What are the challenges to solving the problem?
<ol><li>Are enough people aware of the problem and share a common perception 
of its nature?
<li>Do these people know what to do: Is the knowledge to solve the problem 
available?
<li>Are those who need to help willing and able?
<li>Is there an appropriate framework for action?
<li>Given the above, where do we begin, or how do we proceed from
here?</ol></blockquote>
<p>We received comments on three of these five questions.</em>
<h4>Are enough people aware of the problem and share a common perception of 
its nature?</h4>
<p><em>Comment by Susan Hanna</em>  
<p>The extent to which people know or care about the salmon problem depends 
in large part on whether they study salmon, catch salmon, or stay abreast of 
resource issues. A few people have a good deal of technical knowledge about 
the problem; some are generally aware at a nontechnical level; but most know 
little. This lack of knowledge about a natural resource problem is typical 
of a society in which people spend most of their lives in constructed, 
rather than natural, environments. Perhaps because of their distance from 
natural environments, Americans lavish romantic attention on a few 
charismatic species while approaching others with indifference. In this 
regard salmon are the victims of their own charisma. The liberal use of 
salmon as a regional symbol promotes the romancing of salmon and detracts 
from our ability to appreciate the full complexity of salmon behavior, the 
salmon life cycle, or the ecosystems within which salmon live. It is the 
image of salmon that people see, not real salmon and their problems.  
<p>As little as the salmon problem is understood, even less widely 
appreciated is the cost of our regional choices. The salmon problem arises 
in large part from our pursuit of industrial development and a comfortable 
life for an increasing number of people. Continued regional growth means 
fewer salmon; to reverse that trend would require us to modify our 
expectations about low-cost power and irrigation water, open grazing, 
clear cuts, and fish harvest. Because we have come to expect these benefits, 
life without them is painful to contemplate.
<p>To hold a common perception of the problem would require a common view of 
the limits to growth and development. But while some people see the need for 
limits, others continue to search for engineered solutions to the salmon 
problem that will allow continued expansion.

professor of agricultural and resource economics at Oregon State University.

and Statistical Committee of the Pacific Fishery Management
Council.</a></em>
<h4>Is there an appropriate framework for action?</h4>
<em>Comment by Kai Lee</em>
<p>No. There is too much framework and not enough action. 
<p>The Endangered Species Act, the Northwest Power Act, and the larger body 
of law governing federal action in environmental policy and natural resource 
management have created a complex setting for both public and private 
activity in the salmonid ecosystem.  Moreover, private ownership rights, 
state- administered water law, and tribal, state, and local policies and 
practices affect what can be done. 
<p>A lot has been done over the past generation to assist salmon: habitat 
protection and rehabilitation along freshwater streams and rivers; harvest
 management; research.  The costs are very large - over $300 million per year 
now, according to the Bonneville Power Administration.  The results are 
plainly meager.  The complexity of the institutional framework and the 
conflicts that divide human actors with claims upon the salmon and their 
habitat mean that doing more will be difficult, perhaps impossible.  The 
decline of salmon is accordingly likely.  	
<p>In <em>Upstream,</em> the Academy committee called for efforts along 
three lines.  First, to govern cooperatively, so that the diverse 
stakeholders would be encouraged to work together despite their 
differences.  Second, to work on natural scales, taking full account 
of the biological complications and subtleties of the life cycle 
and needs of salmon.  Third, to proceed using adaptive management, 
thinking of all that is done by humans, especially our policies, 
as experiments from which we seek to learn.  We know far too 
little about salmon and society - the subtitle of the report - and how their interaction can be redirected to the benefit of both.
<p>In particular, the committee called for "pre-emptive" recovery plans to 
be developed, under the framework of the Endangered Species Act, to foster 
cooperative, bioregional, adaptive agreements.  The idea is to create, in as 
many watersheds as feasible, the kind of deliberation and commitment of 
resources that the Northwest Power Planning Council carried out in the 
"salmon summit" of the early 1990s.  Doing this will not be easy, and it 
will challenge and impose costs upon many. The alternative is to watch the 
salmon of the Snake and scattered other drainages go extinct.
<p>We may not be able to save all the stocks; that is the bitter reality.  
We can do a lot to try to prevent the loss of those that are now in danger.  
Trying is inherently an institutional task, for which the existing frameworks
 of action, however awkward and imperfect, must be used and adapted.

<h3><a name="rorschach">A "Rorschach Test"</h3>
<h2>Observers See Strengths, Weaknesses in Report</h2> 
<p>The National Research Council's (NRC) report attracted favorable 
attention when it was released, but since November, those who have studied 
the report have - not unexpectedly - arrived at diverse opinions. 
<p>The <em><a href="http://www.nas.edu/nrc/#NRC">Oregonian</a></em> newspaper, the region's largest, editorialized on 
November 10 ("Save Salmon Now") that "the study is balanced." "It offers the 
best blueprint this region has seen for getting on with the job of restoring 
endangered wild Snake River salmon runs." 
<p>But the year-old, Portland-based <em>Cascadia Times</em> newspaper ran a 
feature story ("Fishy Science") in the January 1996 issue arguing that the 
NRC report "unraveled no mysteries" and, worse, "entirely dismisses the idea 
of reclaiming the Columbia system, or significant parts of it, from the 
clutches of the party that for decades has controlled it - the hydropower 
industry."
<p>We at <em>Restoration</em> guessed that individuals probably had as 
diverse a set of opinions as did the news media. To sample those opinions,
 we invited a spectrum of long-time observers of and participants in salmon 
politics to comment briefly on two questions: How good is the report, and 
what good can or will it do?
<p>At our publication deadline we had received only some of the invited 
commentaries, which we print here.
<hr><h4>Comment by <EM>Bill Bakke, director, Native Fish Society</EM></H4>
<P>The NRC launched its plan for salmon recovery in November following a 
request by Senator Mark Hatfield in 1992. After the failed Salmon Summit, 
my partner, Rick Braun, and I asked the senator for an independent 
scientific study of the problem. The report by the NRC reaches far beyond all
 other salmon plans now on the table, including the one developed by the 
National Marine Fisheries Service. Unlike other salmon plans, the NRC 
report focuses on wild salmon, emphasizing the need to "maintain genetic 
diversity of salmon." The plan says a management priority must be to 
maintain salmon metapopulations and the components that make them up - the 
wild populations adapted to local environments.
<p>The plan makes recommendations on hatcheries, harvest, institutional 
groups, dams and habitat. 
<p>The NRC describes how hatcheries should be operated to support 
the recovery of wild salmon. There is no longer any room for production 
hatcheries serving the interest of harvesters. Hatcheries are clearly noted 
as a major problem in wild salmon conservation.
<p>On harvest the NRC states the purpose must be to increase spawners in 
the rivers for each wild population. Harvest management for maximum 
sustainable yield is no longer justified because not enough spawners 
are allowed to escape the fisheries.
<p>The NRC states that the existing institutional structure is incapable 
of ensuring a long-term future for salmon, and it recommend necessary 
changes.
<p>The NRC stubbed its toe on dams, recommending smolt transportation over 
reservoir drawdown or dam removal. The basis for this conclusion was 
economic not biological.
<p>Habitat for salmon, the NRC says, must be protected on a landscape level, 
focusing on watersheds and wild populations.
<p>Although the NRC report goes well beyond all other salmon recovery plans 
(except for their recommendations on dams), the question remains of how its 
recommendations will be implemented within an official regional context that 
is still in denial. We are focused on producing salmon like, say, brown 
shoes, as a commodity that can be manufactured rather than nurtured by a 
strong commitment to stewardship of an ecological gift.
<p>The NRC report is worth reading by anyone interested in salmon 
conservation. Its recommendations should not be ignored.
<rh><h4>Comment by <em>Jim Baker, Northwest Salmon Campaign Coordinator,
<a href="http://www.nas.edu/nrc/#NRC">Sierra Club</a></em></h4>
<p>Ballyhooed by Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield as the "Supreme Court of 
Science," the National Research Council seems unlikely to become the last 
word on Northwest salmon. Its long-awaited report, Upstream, released late 
last year, suffers from shallow and contradictory analysis.
<p>To its credit, the NRC report rises in very strong defense of biological 
diversity and the protection of native, wild salmonid stocks. The NRC panel 
of scientists also correctly concludes that salmon recovery flows from 
efforts to return to natural ecological systems and processes
- not from 
technological fixes. However, despite this indictment of techno-fix 
solutions, the report gives a rosy review of juvenile fish transportation 
for the endangered Snake River salmon.
<p>The flaws in the NRC report similarly undermine the recommendations 
from the Snake River Salmon Recovery Team - the so-called Bevan plan - 
empaneled by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). 
<p>Neither the NRC panel nor the Bevan recovery team ask - much less answer - 
the bottom-line questions: Of the four salmon-mortality "H's" (hydropower, 
habitat, hatcheries, harvest), which inflicts the most salmon mortalities 
for any given stock? And more important, what do these fish need to survive 
and recover? 
<p>The NRC and Bevan only recommend more study. With so many Pacific 
Northwest salmonid stocks poised at the brink of extinction, a call for more 
study sounds hollow - a prescription for disaster.
<hr><h4>Comment by <em>Glenn Vanselow, Executive Director, Pacific Northwest 
Waterways Association</em></h4> 
<p>There has been concern over the decline of salmon runs for 100 years. 
It resulted in the creation of the Northwest Power Planning Council in 1980. 
Since then, differences about what is necessary to stop the decline and 
rebuild the runs have become more extreme. 
<p>The Salmon Summit brought all parties together at the beginning of this 
decade. We resolved some short-term issues, but, fueled by media exposure, 
the division between the two sides grew. Compromise and consensus did not 
appear possible in the early 1990s.
<p>There have been two attempts to bridge the gap. First was the 
NMFS-appointed Recovery Team. It was followed by the National Academy of 
Science's National Research Council. Both were independent bodies asked to 
provide a scientific basis for rebuilding salmon populations.
<p>The Recovery Team recommendations and the NRC report were greeted with 
the same responses, one side saying, "We don't like all of it, but let's 
follow this scientifically based plan," and the other proclaiming, "It's 
dead on arrival."
<p>We can dig in our feet, hold our positions and continue the debate into 
the next century. Or we can put our resources behind a recovery effort. The 
first will do nothing to help the salmon. The latter holds at least 
some promise. It is time to end the posturing and come together behind 
a single plan. The NRC report is as close as we are likely to come to an 
independent, scientific review. It should provide the basis for a recovery 
plan, and that plan should be supported by all parties. 
<hr>   
<h4>Comment by <em>Glen Spain, Northwest Regional Director, <a href="http://www.pond.net/~pcffa/">
Pacific Coast 
Federation of Fishermen's Associations</a></em></h4> 
<p>The NRC report is like a Rorschach test: there is something in it for 
everybody, and everybody finds some support for his or her treasured point 
of view. You can expect it to be quoted on all sides of every salmon 
argument. The report itself is surprising in two respects: its scathing 
condemnation of most hatchery practices, and its almost cavalier failure 
to deal with the most fundamental issues regarding the Columbia and Snake 
River hydropower systems. 
<p>Its hydropower suggestions are by far the weakest. Furthermore, they are 
tainted by being written by committee member Don Chapman, who built his 
professional career as a defender of the hydropower status quo and 
consultant for the utilities industry.* The report itself is only a summary, 
not new research. Many key questions cannot be answered because there is 
no data.  Its most fundamental conclusion, however, is sound: no one thing 
caused salmon declines in the region. Rather, it is the cumulative impacts 
of dozens of different policies, agencies and practices that must be 
changed, from the top of the watershed, to the ocean, and back again.
<p><em>*Editor's Note: The role of committee member Donald W. Chapman, a 
fisheries consultant from Boise, has been remarked on in other published 
accounts of the committee's work. The feature article "Fishy Science," by 
editor and reporter Paul Koberstein in the January Cascadia Times, reviews 
Chapman's consulting efforts on behalf of PacifiCorp and the Pacific 
Northwest Utility Conference Committee. Critics, like Glen Spain, have 
charged that Chapman wrote the sections of Upstream relating to Columbia 
River hydroelectric operations. In the Cascadia Times article, Chapman 
denies the charge, a denial supported in that publication by NRC staff 
director David Policansky ("The committee wrote the report. It would be 
incorrect to say any member wrote any component").</em>

<h2><a name="statestrat">Oregon Develops Coho Strategy</a></h2>
<p><strong>By Pat Kight,</strong> Oregon Sea Grant Science Writer
<p>By midsummer, Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber hopes to have a plan in place 
for the state to take the lead in restoring coastal coho salmon runs. If the 
plan is good enough, it could prevent coho from winding up on the federal 
endangered species list. Better yet, says Kitzhaber, it could bring coastal 
interests together to do a better job of rebuilding the fish runs than any 
federal action would require.
<p>Kitzhaber announced his plan in December and has assembled three teams 
to do the work:
<ul><li>a planning team made up of representatives from all of Oregon's 
natural resource agencies, along with the Departments of Transportation 
and Economic Development
<li>a second team to keep coastal residents up to date on the effort and to 
solicit their participation and cooperation in the development of the 
state's recovery plan
<li>a panel of scientists who will review the plan to make sure it is based 
on the best possible science and to help set goals and standards for judging 
its success</ul>
<p>The three panels are expected to produce a recovery plan - one involving 
cooperation from the many groups with interest in the salmon issue - before 
mid-July, when the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) faces a court 
deadline to act on petitions to list coastal coho under the Endangered 
Species Act (ESA).
<p>For the moment, the many players in the salmon game are expressing 
cautious optimism toward the governor's plan. Timber and agriculture groups 
have pledged their cooperation, as have conservation groups, even though 
some of the latter are skeptical that any plan can succeed without the 
force of the ESA to back it up.
<p>Kitzhaber's salmon team is soliciting cooperation from California and 
Washington, which also face the potential listing of coastal coho stocks. 
But NMFS has assured Oregon that acceptance of its plan will not hinge on 
the participation of the other two states.

<h3><a name="culture">How Stories and Rituals Sustain Us</a></h3>
<h2>Toward a Restoration Culture </h2>
<p><strong>By <a href="#bottom">Daniel L. Bottom</a></strong>
<p>I agree with those who now emphasize that conservation must be based on 
"sound science." But by this I mean the open, critical process of the 
scientific method, not some statistical proof of significance or cost/benefit
 analyses, which are often used to delay prudent action by hiding difficult 
moral choices behind numbers. Prudent ecosystem conservation is not the same 
as quantitative prediction. It is a deliberative process for informing both
 citizens and decision-makers so that they can choose wisely despite the 
many ecological and cultural uncertainties involved in any management choice.
<P> What is called for, then, is closer attention to the cultural process
 of restoration itself. To date, much of the discussion about salmon 
restoration in the Pacific Northwest has emphasized methods and results: 
what techniques are effective in restoring salmon or how to involve 
landowners in working cooperatively toward watershed health. Clearly, we do
 need some good examples of working "successes" that can demonstrate what 
is possible when we combine sound principles of conservation with the 
responsible stewardship of citizens and communities. 
<P>Yet [author] Bill Jordan suggests that we should not forget the symbolic 
and cultural value of the act of restoration itself. From this perspective,
 restoration is also a "ritual" or "performance" that can strengthen the 
connection between communities and landscapes and promote an attitude of 
caring. In Jordan's words, "restoration that simply restores the landscape 
as an object fails because it fails to deal with the root problem, which is 
the way human beings perceive and understand and value the land." 
<P>Through the ritual of re-creating and healing, we imbue the landscape 
with cultural meaning. Watershed by watershed, the act of restoration is 
a validation or an acting out of an alternative (ecosystem) story. At the 
same time, it is a making of traditions and memories - of stories - that we 
will need to strengthen our resolve and carry us through the long and lean 
years of salmon recovery.
<H4>The Power of Tradition </H4>
<P>We should not dismiss this idea of ritual as simply an  appealing thought 
with little application to our technological society. The suggestion that 
ritual might somehow promote stewardship is certainly not without precedent 
where salmon are concerned. I can think of no better example of the role of 
cultural tradition and ritual in conservation than the management of 
salmon by indigenous Northwesterners. The complex and diverse cultures 
of Northwest Coast peoples, from northern California to the Alaskan 
panhandle, coevolved with Pacific salmon. In elaborate art, traditions, 
and ceremonies these people expressed reverence for salmon and set detailed 
ground rules to regulate their use. The stories and rituals somehow 
"worked," as Northwest cultures and salmon co-existed for thousands of 
years.
<P>The rituals were built around stories of seasonal cycles and the 
interdependence of humans and salmon. Many of the tribes believed that 
salmon were people who lived in villages beneath the sea. At certain 
times each year, the Salmon People turned into fish and ran up the rivers 
to donate their flesh to humans, who were required to treat them with proper 
respect. The fishing season each year was not opened until the First 
Salmon Ceremony was performed. This was a time of great joy and spiritual 
renewal to express thankfulness for the salmon's return. The ritual 
demanded special respect for the first fish of the season, which was 
captured, carried, and prepared in special ways before being shared by 
all. If the ritual was properly performed, then other salmon of the same 
species would also begin the journey upriver. The ceremony ended by placing 
the salmon bones in the water where they came back to life and returned to 
the land of the Salmon People to renew the cycle. 
<H4>The Salmon Gift </H4>
<P>Science has taught us that there are no Salmon People, and that after 
spawning, salmon die and are not reincarnated to swim back to sea. Still, 
the fact remains that salmon returned as long as native fishermen felt 
reverence for the Salmon People; and they gradually stopped returning 
after science declared the earth a vast storehouse stocked with uniform and 
interchangeable salmon parts. I agree that our technologically complex 
society is "doomed to consciousness," and that we have grown too dependent 
on management hierarchies and science to expect that rituals or mere 
instincts could ever guide us safely through the next millenium. Still, 
as relative newcomers to this biocultural region, we have much to learn from 
societies that, at least in some ways, were much more successful than our 
own. Perhaps with the help of history, we can consciously create new 
management systems and cultural traditions around a less destructive 
and more community-oriented tale of nature.
<P>If history is any indication, then one "new" tale of salmon may hold 
promise for the future. Scientists have long known that salmon deliver 
oceanic nutrients to inland waters and serve as food for many terrestrial 
birds and mammals. Robert Bilby, a biologist with the  Weyerhaeuser 
Company in Tacoma, now estimates that as much as 40 percent of the nitrogen 
and carbon in the bodies of juvenile coho salmon (<EM>Oncorhynchus kisutch</EM>) may 
be derived from the carcasses of their parents who die after spawning 
in Washington streams.
<P>It is conceivable, therefore, that the loss of Pacific salmon (or the 
forest's supply of large wood that retains salmon carcasses and nutrients 
in streams) could trigger a self-perpetuating, downward spiral: decline of 
salmon leading to reduced productivity of streams in turn, leading to 
further decline of salmon, and so on. In this tale, we could call salmon a 
"keystone" species that forms a critical link in a cyclical, regenerative 
interaction between land, river, and ocean. Or we could simply say that 
salmon are a gift, and that we must treat them with proper respect so that 
they will donate their flesh to the land river system and their young will 
return to the world of the Salmon People.
<P>I think what we most need from salmon is their story. I do not mean the 
repetitive tale of decline that we know from the brief recorded history of 
European immigrants and the short columns of numbers in the reports of 
fishery managers. The tale we must learn is a far richer, ever changing, 
and interconnected story of nature and culture, which is programmed in 
the genes of salmon and recounted in the legends of ancient cultures. 
Encoded in the lives of salmon is a long history of survival that 
teaches us by example: their incredible struggle against all odds, their 
wandering spirit but steadfast fidelity to home, and their ultimate 
sacrifice to community. Through salmon we find a means for reconnecting 
the landscapes, watersheds, and cultures encompassed by their life 
cycles and impoverished by their decline. And through their restoration, 
we may sink our shallow roots a little deeper into this Northwest place.

<h3><A name="program">Disaster Program</a> benefits fishers,
communities</h3>
<h4>$5 million for habitat work and data collection</h4>
<p><strong>By Pat Kight</strong>
<p>A federal disaster relief program aimed at providing new job skills to out-of-work salmon fishers is paying unexpected dividends for Oregon's watersheds and fisheries.
<p>By working with landowners on habitat protection and restoration, those who used to fish for salmon are forging new partnerships and communities of understanding. Others, meanwhile, are collecting data which could be important in resolving the challeng

es of managing Northwest salmon fisheries.
<p>Oregon's Salmon Disaster Outreach Program, funded by $2.2 million in federal disaster aid and lesser amounts from the state lottery, has put more than 130 salmon fishers to work since June.
<p>More than half have been doing streamside evaluation, restoration, and rehabilitation work: moving brush to improve salmon habitat, planting willows to control stream-bank erosion, helping landowners erect fences to keep cattle out of the streams. The 

rest have continued to take their boats to sea, harvesting scientific data along with fish.
<p>Those who administer the program say it has been highly successful_for those fishers who were able to hang on long enough to take part. Initially, administrators had expected 250 to 300 applicants to qualify for the relief. Fewer than 200 have.
<p>"The problem is that this is a program set up to help people recover from a disaster that happened three to four years ago," said Tom Shafer, the program's outreach coordinator. "A lot of the people it was intended to help have gone on to other things.

 They couldn't afford to sit around and wait for help."
<p>With the first year of the relief program wrapping up this fall, the Clinton administration has pledged $5 million in additional relief to Oregon in the year ahead. Shafer and his colleagues are working to solve eligibility problems that they believe k

ept more people from taking part.
<p>It's not just the boat owners and crews that need disaster relief, they say, but the resource itself. Without more eligible workers, some second-year projects may be difficult to complete.
<p>Unlike Washington state, which has applied much of its federal salmon disaster money toward buying back salmon troll, gill-net, and charter permits, Oregon has opted to continue putting its money into habitat projects ($3 million) and data collection (

$2 million).
<p>"These are projects which benefit the resource, both in the short and long terms," said Shafer. "They also provide data to help better manage the industry. The fishers are learning new skills, and the community gets large benefits_not just from the act

ual work they do, but from the new relationships taking shape between the fishing and farming communities."
<p>Although it was not clear, as Restoration went to press, when the next round of funding would actually arrive in state hands, the state Department of Agriculture's habitat review team was expected to begin screening new restoration proposals in late Oc

tober. At-sea projects are administered by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission through a similar proposal-and-review process.
<p>The two-pronged approach was designed to meet the needs of two groups of fishers: those who want to keep fishing and those ready to move on to something new.
<p>Newport fisher Jeff Feldner is in the first group. After 23 years fishing salmon, crab, and tuna, he was glad to have the chance to add to the knowledge about these resources. 
<p>"There's a tremendous shortage of nuts-and-bolts information to manage these fisheries," said Feldner. "This kind of program can only help."
<p>Working as a subcontractor for Natural Resources Consultants of Seattle, Feldner hired 22 boats and 40 to 50 fishermen to work on three data-collection projects:
<ul><li>A study of hooking mortality among salmon caught by commercial
trollers, off Coos Bay</li>
<li>A test of different fishing gear setups and how well they allow
boats to catch harvestable fish while avoiding protected species</li>
<li>An "encounter rate" study that put observers on several boats
representing a cross section of the Newport fleet to count and measure
every fish caught</li></ul>
<p>"All of the projects attempt to get to the same problem," Feldner said. "We've got abundant stocks of harvestable fish, mostly chinook. We've got stocks that need protection. How can we get at the harvestable fish while avoiding the ones we want to pro

tect?"
<p>Crews involved in the research projects were enthusiastic, not only about the chance to supplement declining incomes, but also about the chance to add to an understanding of the fishery, Feldner said.
<p>"They're proud of the fact that they're helping to do some good, cooperative, systematic information gathering," he said. "We hired a lot of fishermen, and we got a lot of bang for the bucks."
<p>In the woods, meanwhile, fishers were getting to know ranchers, farmers, and other landowners as they worked together to improve the watersheds that play such a critical part in the life cycle of the fish that wind up in the sea. And they were impressi

ng the people who coordinated their work.
<p>"When fishermen are working, you don't see them," said Anne Donnelly,
executive director of the Coos Watershed Association, which hired 11
people through the Salmon Disaster Outreach Program.
<p>Although the work was different from what they were used to, Donnelly said, the qualities that make people good at sea apply equally well in the woods: resourcefulness, the ability to work in a team, a resilience and willingness to work in all kinds of

 weather and on all sorts of terrain.
<p>"Give them a bona fide opportunity to solve a problem and get something done," Donnelly said, "and then stand back and let them rip."
<p>The Coos County projects, involving stream surveys, fence building, and other work, were among 14 funded through the disaster outreach program: at least one in every coastal county, plus one in eastern Oregon's Wasco county, according to Tom Brunn of t

he Oregon Department of Economic Development.
<p>The habitat projects provided short-term jobs, usually lasting between four and six months, for 75 to 80 fishers; perhaps a dozen of the jobs were designed to last as long as a year. Several individuals were able to move on to a second watershed job af

ter completing their first.
<p>When workers needed it, contractors held their jobs open to give them time to fish.
<p>First-year watershed projects included
<ul><li>Fence building in Clatsop County, where almost every landowner
in the areas earmarked for projects signed up to take part</li>

<p>On land or at sea, almost every person who enrolled in the project stuck with it, according to Tom Shafer.

<p>Better yet, says Shafer, new communities are taking shape.
<p>"When fisher and farmer cooperate, it gives reason to hope for recovery of the salmon resource."

<h3><a name="cohostatus">Oregon Coast Coho: Status and
Prospects</a></h3>
<p><em>Editor's Note:On July 25 the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) announced that it proposed to protect certain populations of coastal coho salmon under the Endangered Species Act. The proposed "threatened" listings will include all native coho

 salmon stocks from south of the Columbia River to northern Monterey Bay, California. Final listings are scheduled to be made next July, after public review of the agency's findings.
<p>In determining the stocks of salmon to include in their decision, NMFS evaluated them according to a new standard the agency adopted in recent years:
<p><blockquote>NMFS policy provides that a salmonid population will be
considered distinct, and hence a species under the ESA, if it represents
an Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) of the biological species. A
population must satisfy two criteria to be considered an ESU: (1) It
must be reproductively isolated from other conspecific population units,
and (2) it must represent an important component in the evolutionary
legacy of the biological species.</blockquote>
<p>Below, Restoration excerpts NMFS' discussion of one ESU, historically
the largest one, from the north and central Oregon coast. Apart from the
biological discussion, the report provides an interesting perspective on
land ownership and use, hatchery fish, and conservation opportunities.
See "For Further Information" for reference to the NMFS publications
about the coho.</em>
<h3>Oregon Coast ESU</h3>
<h4>Proposed: "threatened" listing</h4>
<h4>Range/Distribution</h4>
<p>This ESU is comprised of native, naturally-reproducing coho salmon in coastal river basins from Cape Blanco (near Port Orford, Oregon) to the Columbia River. Rivers known to support coho salmon include: Necanicum River, Nehalem River, Trask River, Till

amook River and Tillamook Bay tributaries, Nestucca River, Salmon River, Siletz River, Yaquina River, Alsea River, Siuslaw River, Siltcoos River, Tahkenitch Creek, Umpqua River, Smith River, Tenmile Creek, Coos River, Coquille River, New River and Sixes R

iver.
<p>Most Oregon coastal streams support coho salmon runs; however, substantial portions of the populations in these rivers are considered to be of hatchery origin. Within this ESU's range, the rivers considered to support the healthiest runs of naturally-r

eproducing coho salmon include: Siltcoos River/Lake, Tahkenitch Creek/Lake, Umpqua River, Smith River, Tenmile Lake, Coos River, and Coquille River. Other important rivers include: Nehalem River, Tillamook Bay tributaries, Nestucca River, Siletz River, Al

sea River, and Siuslaw River.
<p>Historically this ESU is believed to have produced between 1 million and 1.4 million native coho salmon. Current production of coho salmon in this ESU is unknown. However the majority of fish in this ESU are considered to be non-native (hatchery fish o

r from streams stocked with hatchery fish); today only 39,000 are believed to be native, naturally-reproducing fish.
<h4>Land Ownership/Uses</h4>
<p>The range of this ESU overlaps 14 Oregon counties and has the following approximate ownership pattern: 
<ul><li>Federal Lands = 35%</li>
<li>State Lands = 9%</li> 
<li>Private/other = 56%</li></ul>
<p>The dominant land use activities within the range of this ESU is [sic] forestry and agriculture. Federal lands are primarily managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management for timber harvest and other activities. The majority of Feder

al lands are located in the southern half of the ESU's range, especially in the Siuslaw River (Siuslaw National Forest) and Umpqua River (Umpqua National Forest) watersheds. The majority of state land is located in watersheds at the northern extreme of th

is ESU's range (Tillamook and Clatsop State Forests), and have [sic] significant overlap with the Tillamook River and Nehalem River watersheds. The distribution of private lands within and among individual watersheds varies considerably. In general, priva

te lands (primarily agricultural) dominate the lower reaches of rivers within this ESU's range, while many of the upland areas are under Federal and state ownership.
<h4>Conservation Approach/Opportunities</h4>
<p>This ESU's range contains significant amounts of both Federal and non-Federal lands and will require conservation efforts with both Federal agencies and private entities. On Federal lands, implementation of the aquatic conservation strategy in the Nort

hwest Forest Plan is expected to maintain and restore coho salmon habitat. Because a significant portion of land ownership within this ESU's range is non-Federal, an important element of the conservation strategy for protecting and recovering coho will be

 the implementation of conservation measures on non-Federal land either by working in concert with the State or with private individuals directly. Because coho are being proposed as threatened within this ESU, it may be possible to pursue special 4(d) rul

es authorizing take, as well as ESA Section 10 habitat conservation plans; perhaps on a watershed basis. Restrictions on coho salmon harvest are in place and likely to continue to be necessary until wild coho salmon stocks increase in abundance.

<h2><A name="reflections">Reflections on Species Conservation Strategies</a></h2>
<p><em>The cliche is not altogether inappropriate: Often, with the endangered species controversy in the Northwest, we can't see the forest for the trees. Daily events and passions cloud our vision and prevent us from seeing clearly some of the bigger iss

ues. In the last decade Angus Duncan and Randal O'Toole have participated closely in the debates over endangered species - and more broadly, over resource conservation strategies - Duncan making public policy, O'Toole influencing it. While their views dif

fer considerably, they share a common ability to step back, see the big picture, and suggest approaches that may help us to get from where we are to the conservation and restoration of species that we say we want. </em>
<h3><a name="trustfund">A Trust Fund for Biodiversity</a></h3>
<p><strong>By Randal O'Toole</strong>
<p>The Endangered Species Act is a wonderfully idealistic piece of legislation that was apparently written by people who had absolutely no idea about how society works. The law's goals are so noble and uplifting that few could disagree with them. Yet its 

means for achieving those goals are doomed to failure.    
<p>The act's authors embodied their ideals in a program that takes punitive measures against public land managers or private landowners whose land happens to be habitat for a threatened or endangered species. To avoid such punitive measures, the landowner

s and managers sometimes rush to destroy the habitat for diminishing species of wildlife before someone declares that species to be threatened or endangered, demonstrating that poorly written laws often accomplish exactly the opposite of what their author

s intended.    
<p>The reasoning behind this law can be found in the writings of environmental philosophers, particularly Roderick Nash. Nash suggests that human ethics have evolved from the point where people considered themselves responsible only to members of their ow

n tribe to the point where people treat all other humans with equality and respect. The next natural step, Nash suggests, is that people will grant nature rights that have been traditionally reserved only for humans.    
<p>Until the ethics of all human beings have evolved to this point, however, it may be necessary for those who hold these new environmental ethics to forcibly or even violently force less ethical people to take care of, or at least do no harm to, other sp

ecies. This is the logic behind the animal rights movement and the Endangered Species Act.    
<p>Historians of the 20th century will recognize this logic. It is the same used by Vladimir Lenin when he suggested that, as capitalism was based on selfishness, socialism would be based on selflessness. The next step in human social evolution, Lenin pro

posed, was the formation of a New Soviet Man, who would automatically work and make all decisions for the benefit of society rather than for his or her selfish needs.    
<p>Lenin recognized that New Soviet Men would not instantly appear. Until education and the benefits of socialism produced such people, the Bolsheviks would control society, making all decisions for the benefit of all the people rather than for a few. The

 promise and goals of soviet society were so inspiring that they seemed to justify almost any sacrifice to reach them_including the deaths of millions of people.    
<p>It's doubtful that supporters of the Endangered Species Act would advocate mass killings to achieve the act's goals. But most agree that private landowners should be willing to give up their preferred uses of their land if the land contains habitat for

 a threatened or endangered species. The fact that few private landowners agree is only proof that such people have not yet achieved enlightenment and that more work is needed to overcome the forces of evil.    
<p>It may seem surprising, even outrageous, to suggest that an American Congress based an important law on a soviet model. But after all, most of the natural resource laws passed during the 1970s - and for many years before - were soviet in nature. . . . 

Congress has come to manage our natural resources the same way the soviets managed their entire economy. The results have also been similar: huge monetary losses producing surpluses of politically favored goods while creating severe shortages of others. 
<p>. . . In retrospect, it seems surprising that we would expect that ethics alone could lead agency managers to risk their budgets, members of Congress to give up their pork, and private landowners to reduce their incomes to protect rare species. This is

 especially so when the biological circumstances that threaten a species are always debatable. . . .
<p>Imagine that the authors of the interstate highway legislation had decided to use a soviet model similar to the Endangered Species Act. Their bill would have called for highway planners in Washington, D.C., to draw lines on maps showing where the roads

 would go. Then it would decree that everyone whose land was crossed by one of those lines would have to build, at their own expense, a highway to federal standards and then let anyone use the highway.
<p>If someone's house stood in the way of a highway, they would have to tear it down or move it at their own expense. Where the lines crossed public land, the public managers would be required to build the roads without any significant increases in their 

budgets for such construction.
<p>. . . Of course, the proponents of the Interstate Highway System didn't use a soviet model. Instead, their American plan assessed fees on highway users and dedicated those fees to a trust fund that would buy land and build roads. Landowners were fairly

 compensated for their land and disputes were minor. If anything, the result is too many highways.
<p>Let's imagine rewriting the Endangered Species Act following this model. First, just as highway proponents fought subsidies to railroads, we have to eliminate any subsidies to activities that threaten diminishing species. Such subsidies are the biggest

 threats to rare species on both public and private land. They include everything from below-cost timber sales to animal damage control programs to import tariffs on sugar that encourage sugar production near the Everglades.    
<p>Second, just as highway departments were given the authority to buy land for road construction, we have to give endangered species advocates the authority to buy land - or the rights to use that land - for wildlife habitat. This is possible on private 

land, but not on public land.    
<p>On private land, but not on federal land, I can buy timber and not cut it down, pay for a grazing right and leave the grass for wildlife, or hold a mineral right but leave the minerals in the ground. The Forest Service and other public agencies should 

be allowed and even encouraged to sell easements to people who wish to protect resources rather than use them.
<p>Third, we need to create a trust fund to protect biodiversity. Trust fund managers could use its monies to buy land, buy conservation easements, pay landowners or managers to use or avoid certain practices, or simply pay bounties to landowners or manag

ers whose land is providing habitat for breeding pairs of rare or endangered species.    
<p>What user fees shall we dedicate to this trust fund? Since public lands form a significant component of biodiversity, I propose we dedicate 20 percent of all public land user fees to the biodiversity trust fund. In effect, people who "use up" the biodi

versity on public land would pay into the fund protecting biodiversity on both public and private lands.    
<p>To make this truly effective, we need to increase all public land user fees to fair market value. Currently, such fees are strictly regulated by Congress to be well below market value. Of national forest user fees, for example, only the fees for timber

 and oil and gas (and a few other minerals) are set at or near market value.    
<p>The most important gains can be made by charging fair market value for recreation. The Forest Service says that the 330 million annual visitor days of national forest recreation has a market value of more than $6.6 billion - six times the receipts from

 all other uses combined. Even if this value - which averages $20 per visitor day - is overestimated, the potential receipts are clearly significant.    
<p>Of course, recreation wouldn't be sold by the day but in the form of annual or short-term permits. Such permits could be monitored at modest cost by requiring people to visibly display the permits on their car or their person. Many forms of recreation 

would be very cheap; others, such as hunting trophy animals, expensive.    
<p>At a modest average fee of $6 per visitor day, recreation income from all federal lands would total about $4.6 billion per year. Combined with other user fees, total public land receipts would exceed $8 billion per year. Supposing that 20 percent of th

ese fees were dedicated to biodiversity, the trust fund would have an income of $1.6 billion per year. Some may feel this isn't enough, but it is many times more than is available today or is likely to be available at any time in the future under the curr

ent system.    
<p>Designing the Endangered Species Act using an American model rather than a soviet model thus requires
<ol><li>a biodiversity trust fund able to buy land, buy conservation easements, pay managers to use or avoid certain practices, and pay bounties for rare species;</li>
<li>seeding the trust fund with a share of public land user fees;</li>
<li>charging a broader range of user fees at market value;</li>
<li>changing use-it-or-lose-it provisions in federal land permits to use it or conserve it; and</li>
<li>ending subsidies to environmentally destructive activities. On
public lands, this means funding agencies out of their net income rather
than tax dollars since tax dollars usually find their way to
environmentally destructive programs. </li>
</ol>
<p>This program would do far more than the soviet model to protect
endangered species and biodiversity. If anything, like the highway program, it might produce "too much" biodiversity. People who worry about the future of other species can hardly complain about that.

<h3><a name="beyond">Beyond the Market: A Sense of Community</a></h3>
<p><strong>By Angus Duncan</strong>
<p>We must address some issues often overlooked in the discussion of endangered species. One issue involves markets, biological thresholds, and the burden of proof.
<p>Species such as salmon evolve to, survive, and prosper within specific, defined ecological niches. When conditions within these niches are altered past certain biological thresholds, fish decline and die. But the thresholds are not always clearly defin

ed by science, and when the science is less than conclusive, human uses almost always receive the benefit of the doubt. In the name of balance we will assure salmon and other species only those conditions for which they can advance undisputed scientific c

laims.
<p>Human uses are driven by market economics, and markets seek predictability; they prefer sales and revenue data over scientific uncertainty. Markets insist upon the benefit of the doubt; they project the burden of proof onto salmon and watersheds. Marke

ts are fundamentally short term and demand short-term proofs. Ecological systems deliver proofs, but usually over great expanses of time (by human standards) and in a fashion that is fundamentally irreversible. 
<p>Another issue is known as "the tragedy of the commons," where, for their private benefit, a few individuals overconsume goods we all hold in common.
<p>It is essential that we establish clear and equitable terms for the use of our commons - our airshed, our waters, our land - so no user is put at a disadvantage in the market for respecting their value as a common good. We cannot ask private businesses

 to observe an environmental ethic at the price of becoming noncompetitive, losing market share to a competitor with different ethics. But neither can we allow short-term market forces - in effect, cash flow and quarterly returns - to determine the best l

ong-term use and conservation of the commons. 
<p>The next issue is what I call cultural and historical inertia: How do we change those values that had a practical worth a hundred years ago but may be counterproductive today? This is a problem I see often . . . the rancher or farmer or fisher who has 

practiced his husbandry for decades, often as his father did and perhaps his grandfather also. How could it be good to break the soil and subdue nature then, but sometimes wrong now? Do these people have to forswear their history? Confess the sins of thei

r fathers and mothers?
<p>Is it any wonder that environmental issues polarize when not just livelihoods, but family histories and values are challenged? Communities still closely tied to the land, to resource economies, feel most threatened. They should; they are. These communi

ties depend not on Silicon Forest but on the real, fragile forests of Wallowa-Whitman and Challis and the Clearwater. 
<p>Change is coming for them and for us. The wisest heads in these communities recognize it, if they do not welcome it. The transition will be most difficult when it is most abrupt. It deserves from the rest of us a respect for values inherited and honest

ly held. And it merits a little patience as traditional communities try to change practices without surrendering their histories and values. 
<p>All the foregoing is complicated and difficult to communicate in the political marketplace, which yearns for simple truths. Wishing for a simpler world won't make us one. But there are some lessons to learn and apply and some handholds we can use.
<p>We will have to learn to cope with uncertainty, not be paralyzed by it. Taking no action may sometimes be the right choice. But going limp never is. 
<p>We will have to learn to cope with complexity; we can't allow the debate to be dumbed down. Describe the threshold conditions species need, in as much complexity as the subject merits; then don't expect species to prosper with less. 
<p>Remember that market economics and technology can dig us deeper into our hole, or they can be rungs of the ladder we climb out on. If we're not ready to alter our behavior in significant ways, the technology won't save us. It will reflect our misplaced

 values, not compensate for them; it will make the problems more intractable, not less.
<p>We need to remember that abrupt change is hard for many. We need to get enough ahead of our problems with threatened species and damaged watersheds that we can change slowly enough for people and fast enough for fish.
<p>We have to ask people to change without overt value judgments on how they and their families have lived their lives. 
<p>We need to begin, as John Wesley Powell advised us a century ago, with the watershed and with the people who live there. 
<p>And lastly, we should all read more history. Most of us live in isolation from the past and therefore from the future. We rarely live in the same place for long, and rarely within the same family circle for a lifetime. We need to discover or rediscover

 that the fundamentals of stewardship lie in our connections to the past and the future; to our belief that we exist as a community that extends over the full extent of the planet and also forward and backward in time.

<h3><a name="esaudpate">Update: Endangered Species Act Fracas</a></h3>
<p><strong>by Joe Cone</strong>
<p>The temperature on the long-running endangered species debate was turned up significantly during the past several months as sweeping changes to the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) began to appear in Congress. In the Senate in May, Washington Senat

or Slade Gorton introduced the Endangered Species Reform Act of 1995 (S. 768). 
<p>"Never has a piece of legislation been introduced that has such potential to destroy wildlife," Peter Berle, the president of the National Audubon Society, said about the Gorton bill. Critics complained that under the bill the secretary of the interior

 or of commerce (in the case of marine species) could essentially plan for the extinction of a species by protecting it only from direct killing while allowing its habitat to disappear. 
<p>If conservationists and others were alarmed by the Senate bill, they sounded positively outraged by a companion bill offered in the House, H.R. 2275. Introduced in September by Republican Congressmen Don Young of Alaska and Richard Pombo of California,

 the Endangered Species Conservation and Management Act of 1995 was widely assailed.
<p>"We do not believe the American people will support the extreme measures taken in this bill that effectively repeal the [Endangered Species] Act," said George Frampton, assistant secretary of the interior.
<p>"We are calling it the Fisherman's Extinction Act," said Glen Spain of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations. "It would make it impossible to protect any fish in the U.S. ever again under the ESA."
<p>More than Democratic politicians and fishers complained about the effects of the Young/Pombo bill on Northwest salmon runs. The Oregonian editorialized Monday, September 18 that the details of the bill "are real killers." The bill's message, the paper 

said, is "We really want to save endangered species as long as it doesn't inconvenience anybody."
<p>The San Francisco Chronicle called the bill "the most radical anti-environmental bill of the 104th Congress."
<p>Like the Gorton bill, Young/Pombo makes endangered species protection optional, not obligatory on the responsible secretary. 
<p>Coming in for particular criticism was the provision of Young/Pombo that would compensate private landowners for complying with ESA provisions. (See article by Randal O'Toole in this issue.) Section 19 of the bill defined a "right to compensation":
<p><blockquote>(a) Prohibition - the Federal Government shall not take an agency
action affecting privately owned  property or nonfederally owned
property under this Act which results in diminishment of value of any
portion of that property by 20 percent or more unless compensation is
offered.</blockquote>
<p>Critics of Young/Pombo included Republicans who proposed alternative bills to reauthorize the ESA. One such bill, H.R. 2374, was introduced by Rep. Wayne Gilchrest of Maryland. 
<p>At Restoration press time in October, the fate of ESA legislation in this Congress was not clear.
<p>Meanwhile, the fate of salmon was looking not so good, and not all the troubling news was from the West Coast. In New England Atlantic salmon in seven Maine rivers were proposed for threatened status under the ESA by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

 In a statement , service officials said they "believe that ocean harvesting, low survival rates and past land-use and hatchery stocking practices have all contributed to the salmon's decline." 
<p>This litany of problems probably would not come as a great surprise to those who have been following the decline of Pacific salmon stocks in the Northwest.

<h3><a name="insights">Insights of Field Research Team</a></h3>
<h4>Taking a Landscape Approach to Restoration</h4>
<p><strong>By Linda Ashkenas, Stan Gregory and Randy Wildman</strong>
<p>Researchers have begun to recognize the effects of past land-use practices in some of the damage we observe in our hillsides and streams in the Pacific Northwest. Along with this awareness has come a growing conviction that we need to help nature heal.

 Many federal and state agencies, private companies, nongovernmental organizations, and concerned citizens have begun restoration efforts. Because many of our native Northwest fish, such as salmon and trout, have been declining over the past two decades, 

the focus of most energy and money has been on river and stream restoration. 
<p>The OSU Stream Team (centered in the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife) has been involved in several of these projects. We have also begun to try to evaluate the effectiveness of restoration efforts over large watershed or landscape scales and over 

long periods of time. The interaction of riparian (streamside) vegetation with stream organisms and ecological processes has been the concern of much of our research over the past two decades. Riparian vegetation is an important predictor of stream health

.
<p>We have learned that streamside vegetation provides an important source of nutrients to stream food webs and that its shade maintains the cool temperatures required by native organisms. When large streambank trees die and fall into the creeks, the wood

 provides an important element of the habitat needed by stream-dwelling fish. Decades of woody debris removal for salvage and practices such as log driving and splash damming have left many Oregon streams deficient in wood. As a consequence, stream channe

ls have become unstable and fish habitat has been lost. 
<p>Many restoration projects have aimed to return this wood to streams by placing logs back in the creeks. Unfortunately, these efforts tend to have two major problems: they fix only a very small portion of what is broken, and they do not provide a source

 for future inputs of large woody debris. In many ways, they may function merely as well-intentioned Band-Aids. 
<p>Ultimately, to be successful, stream restoration must take into consideration the entire landscape and must include restoring riparian vegetation as well as in-stream characteristics.
<h4>Satellites Aid in Recognizing Local Patterns</h4>
<p>One key to restoring riparian forests on a landscape scale is knowing how to look at and analyze them. To get this "big picture," we have begun using satellite imagery. 
<p>At Quartz Creek in the central Cascade Mountains, we designed a project to return woody debris to a channel that had been logged and whose in-stream wood had been salvaged. We hoped to create more complex and stable habitat for native trout and to retu

rn a deeply incised channel to contact with its floodplain. We compared patterns of riparian vegetation (using satellite imagery), woody debris, and fish (using field measurements) with Mack Creek, a nearby old-growth stream of similar size.
As shown in <a href="1195tables.html">the figures</a>, five years after our initial placement of some key pieces of large wood, the amounts of woody debris and the abundance of cutthroat trout in Quartz Creek have met (and in some cases exceeded) the leve

ls we might expect in an undisturbed stream such as Mack Creek. However, the differences in riparian vegetation are sobering. 
<p><a name="pickup">Quartz Creek</a> has few mature or old conifers in its riparian zone. The streambanks are dominated by small deciduous trees, such as alder, and shrubs. There is no source of future large woody debris for the stream; essentially we wil

l have to replace the wood in the channel for many decades to come. In addition, we have improved only a one-kilometer section of Quartz Creek; there are many more kilometers in need of restoration on just this small drainage. 
<p>This type of restoration is costly in terms of both time and money. Many of us have begun to realize that such stream restoration projects are likely to be of short duration and able to encompass only a fraction of the creeks and rivers in need of repa

ir. Some of our current focus on in-stream restoration needs to be redirected to riparian restoration. Such activities could include planting conifers near streams to provide a future source of woody debris or using techniques such as thinning to accelera

te growth of existing riparian conifers. 
<p>Such riparian restoration should be done on a large, landscape scale, and planned to ensure the long-term sustainability of riparian processes. Successful restoration should be judged not by how many logs we add back to a creek, but how well we return 

streams and riparian areas to self-sustaining systems that do not require continual assistance to function.   Finally, we must recognize that streams and riparian areas require restoration across the entire state of Oregon. Much of the past and present fo

cus has been in the forested portions of our landscape. However, many of the most degraded (and formerly most productive) salmon and trout streams lie in locations significantly changed by agricultural practices and urbanization. 
<p>If we are to restore stream and riparian landscapes, we need to be sure that downstream areas of farmland, towns, cities, streets, and highways are included. If we do not, then all of our well-intentioned attempts at fixing problems in forested areas a

re likely to have little long-term effect at restoring Oregon's streams and salmon.

<H2>Summer 1995 - Full Text</H2>    
<H3><A NAME="legislature">State Watershed Program Changes</A></H3> 
<P><EM>Changes are in store for how Oregon conducts state watershed
programs. In 1993, the Oregon legislature created the Watershed Health
Program, directing the Strategic Water Management Group (SWMG) to
provide oversight. </EM>
</P><P>Now "Swim-gee" is out and "Gee-web" is in. House bill 3441,
passed by the 1995 house and senate and signed into law by Gov.
Kitzhaber, now transfers watershed management from the SWMG (often
pronounced Swim-gee) to the Governor's Watershed Enhancement Board (GWEB
- Gee-web). More than a stirring of state-agency alphabet soup is
involved. We have two stories on the change.  
</P>
<H3>Some Legislative Background</H3> 
<P><EM>By Julie Coontz</EM>
</P><P>House bill (HB) 3441 was developed by Rep. Chuck Norris
(R-Hermiston) and a broad-based group. One major purpose of the new
legislation was to consolidate the state's watershed effort into one
agency and reduce administrative costs. 
</P><P>SWMG was abolished this session by senate bill 502, which
transferred its functions related to groundwater to the Department of
Environmental Quality. All other watershed-related functions were
transferred to GWEB, which was seen by those who developed HB 3441 as
the appropriate entity to coordinate the watershed health program. 
</P><P>GWEB's watershed management program will rely on establishment
of voluntary local watershed councils composed of citizens, state and
federal agency staff, members of federally recognized Indian Tribes, and
interested citizens. GWEB is to encourage development of local plans
that may include assessment of the condition of the watershed, creation
of a watershed action plan and a strategy for implementing an action
plan. 
</P><P>Staffing for watershed health programs will be combined and
reduced by about two-thirds from the 1993-1995 biennium (from 22 to 8
employees). 
</P><P>GWEB will use technical advisory staff from the departments of
Economic Development, Fish and Wildlife, Forestry, Agriculture, and
Environmental Quality and from the OSU Extension Service. The federal
Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, Bureau of Reclamation,
Natural Resources Conservation Service, and EPA will also be asked to
provide advisory assistance. 
</P><P>The new bill permits the GWEB board to designate high-priority
watersheds but makes clear that this authority is not meant to
discourage formation of watershed councils in other watersheds or affect
any watershed council in existence when the law took effect. 
</P><P>GWEB will report annually to the appropriate legislative
committee on its watershed management program. 
</P><P>Martha Pagel, in her testimony before the Water Policy Committee
in May, endorsed the legislation. Pagel, director of the Oregon Water
Resources Department, said that HB 3441 would "blend the best aspects of
the Governor's Watershed Enhancement Board and the Watershed Health
Program. The bill establishes a unified watershed program to support
local actions and local watershed councils." 
</P><P>"This bill makes sense," Pagel said, "because GWEB and watershed
health programs have the same ultimate goal - locally driven efforts to
achieve fully functional and sustainable watershed ecosystems." 
</P><P>The Association of Oregon Counties strongly supported HB 3441 in
its original form, which provided that the county governing body would
form or designate the local watershed council. This provision was
amended in the final version to read that local government groups, which
consist of interested cities, counties, water supply districts, and
sewer districts, are encouraged to form voluntary local watershed
councils. Testifying on behalf of the Oregon Farm Bureau Federation,
Pete Test supported HB 3441, saying that its program "is necessary and
important to the health and productivity of Oregon's agriculture
community." 
</P><P>However, in testimony in April about the original version of the
bill, Jim Myron of Oregon Trout told the Water Policy Committee that the
conservation organization had some concerns about GWEB. Myron criticized
the agency's "shotgun approach that ignores the need to prioritize
projects and [its] lack of an adequate monitoring program." 
</P><P>Oregon Trout was also concerned that GWEB's watershed program
had previously focused solely on enhancement and not on protection and
restoration. <EM>Julie Coontz is a University of Oregon law student and
was a legislative fellow during the 1995 Oregon legislative session. Her
fellowship was sponsored jointly by the Oregon Coastal Zone Management
Association and Oregon Sea Grant.</EM>
</P> 
<H3><A Name="funding">Priority Funding vs. Open Competition</A></H3> 
<P><EM>By Pat Kight</EM>
</P><P>House bill 3441 puts all state watershed enhancement and
conservation projects under the authority of the Governor's Watershed
Enhancement Board (GWEB). 
</P><P>Since its establishment in 1987, GWEB has served mainly to
channel state funds to farmers, educational institutions, and soil and
water conservation districts for projects mostly related to agriculture.

</P><P>The new bill gives the board additional responsibility to help
fund and monitor the efforts of local watershed councils that are
working to identify, restore, and protect critical fish habitats. The
councils were formed and funded under a 1993 law that placed them under
a different state body, the Strategic Water Management Group (SWMG). 
</P><P>The goal of HB 3441 is to consolidate watershed efforts under a
single state authority, saving money, trimming staff, and reducing
duplication. That goal, say those concerned with salmon health, is
laudable. Their concern is whether GWEB will give enough attention - in
the form of dollars - to watersheds identified as critical to salmon
restoration. 
</P><P>"Prioritizing is very important," said Louise Bilheimer of the
Pacific Rivers Council, a regional conservation organization based in
Eugene. "The state invested a lot of money last biennium to develop a
prioritizing system that identifies critical watersheds . . . . If
there's a limited amount of money, then that system should help
determine where it is spent." 
</P><P>The money, indeed, is limited. Lawmakers allotted the program
$2.6 million for 1995-97 - just over half of what Governor Kitzhaber had
requested and far less than SWMG was allotted for enhancement efforts in
1993-95. 
</P><P>A share of the 1995-97 money - about $381,000 - has already been
awarded to "traditional GWEB-type projects," according to Rick Craiger,
GWEB program coordinator for the Oregon Water Resources Department.
These are mostly small educational efforts - workshops, demonstration
projects, and the like - sponsored by agriculture and soil conservation
groups. 
</P><P>GWEB expects to begin taking applications for the remaining $2.3
million early next year, after the board finishes reworking its rules
and procedures to adapt to the requirements of HB 3441. 
</P><P>(HB 3441 also gave GWEB responsibility for more than $5.5
million carried over from SWMG's 1993-95 budget. That money, however,
has already been awarded to local watershed projects in the
high-priority south coast and Grand Ronde areas; GWEB will merely
administer the grants and oversee completion of the projects.) 
</P><P>In the past, GWEB's competitive grant process has been open to
"anyone, anywhere," said Craiger. "At this point, I think the board is
leaning toward opening this (additional) money up to statewide
competition, too. Prioritizing would exclude a lot of areas from
applying." 
</P>
<H5>Will Effect of Funds Be Diluted?</H5> 
<P>Groups such as the Pacific Rivers Council contend that, when
restoration dollars are limited, they should go first to those
watersheds where they can have the most impact for fish. 
</P><P>Conservation interests hope to use the rule-making period
between now and the end of the year to persuade GWEB members to work
with a watershed priority-setting system developed by the state during
the past year. 
</P><P>The question came up during debate over the bill this spring.
Lawmakers chose to allow - but not require - the board to identify
priority watersheds and presumably fund projects in them. 
</P><P>Far more debate arose, especially when the bill was being
drafted, over who should be allowed to set up the watershed councils
that will be eligible to apply for GWEB funds. Oregon's counties wanted
to keep that authority to themselves, but other players - including
cities like Portland, with major watersheds of their own - balked. So
did some of the 40-plus watershed councils that are already up and
working around the state. 
</P><P>The bill's final version suggests that counties establish such
councils, but leaves it open for other entities, public and private, to
do so as well - and to compete for a share of the watershed money. 
</P><P>However the politics play out, most players are hopeful the new
program will be good for the fish. 
</P><P>"I think it will," said Bilheimer. "It should give local
landowners a sense of ownership about restoring watersheds for aquatic
species and for human species." 
</P><P>GWEB staffer Rick Craiger agrees. "GWEB has a good reputation.
The Watershed Health Program has a good reputation," he said. "I believe
GWEB is going to be a tool local councils - and others - can use to
accomplish their goals."

<H3><A NAME="beschta">Studies Summarize Forestry Effects on Fish</A></H3>

<P><EM>In 1991, the Oregon senate commissioned two expert studies
that, in different ways, were to examine the status of salmon and their
habitats in coastal Oregon. Both studies were presented to the
legislature during the recent session and have been published.
Restoration introduces and excerpts them here, and provides references
to the full studies for our readers' information.<EM></EM></EM>
</P> 
<H3>Cumulative Effects Too Important to Ignore </H3> 
<P><EM>Editor's note: </EM>
</P><P><EM>The senate asked Oregon State University (OSU) to provide
the Oregon Department of Forestry with information concerning the
cumulative effects of forest practices on air, water, soils, fish, and
wildlife resources. The initial phase of this evaluation included
identification of cumulative effects resulting from forest practices, a
literature review and synthesis of current knowledge, development of
conceptual frameworks, and identification of research needs and
potential studies. 
</EM></P><P><EM>Several scientists from different disciplines at OSU
worked on the report, Cumulative Effects of Forest Practices in Oregon,
whose 11 chapters include those on the definitions and the history of
cumulative effects, the forest land base in Oregon, past and present
forest practices, and ecosystem integration. In addition, separate
chapters were prepared on the cumulative effects of forest practices on
air, soils, water, aquatic biota, and wildlife. 
</EM></P><P><EM>It's often difficult to specify what the cumulative
effects of forest management practices are. The resources interact in
complex ways; past practices, natural forces, and current conditions
also have a complex interplay. And it's notoriously difficult to
forecast future conditions. As a result multiple interpretations are
possible. 
</EM></P><P><EM>The researchers tried to provide some clear thinking
through this muddle. Two sections from their "Executive Summary" are
excerpted here. </EM>
</P>
<H3>The Effects of Forest Practices on Aquatic Biota</H3> 
<P>. . . Many forestry effects accumulate over long periods of time,
creating chronic disturbances, often off-site from the original
operation. For example, chronic suspended sediments can decrease growth
rates of anadromous salmonids, increase competition for food, increase
susceptibility to disease, and reduce successful migration to the ocean.

</P><P>Effects of residues from herbicides and insecticides also may
create chronic problems. Because toxicities change with alterations in
pH and temperature for products such as malathion and Roundup,
bottom-dwelling organisms subject to these conditions may be especially
vulnerable. Little is known about minimum dosages that produce no
biological effects for natural assemblages of aquatic organisms, and
wide margins of safety are recommended in the use of chemicals. 
</P><P>Loss of large woody debris, resulting from either instream,
riparian or upslope removal of large wood, results in extremely
deleterious chronic deficits. Large wood in streams creates diversity in
habitat for fish and invertebrates, provides refuge from stream flow,
and retains both leafy litter substrates for invertebrates and nutrients
for algae. Potential consequences for fish are shifts in population
structure, greater mortality during periods of high flow, and changes in
species distribution. 
</P><P>Moreover, recruitment of large wood into a stream following
removal of mature trees typically requires 60 years or more. A loss of
stability in stream habitat and fish assemblages characterize [sic]
systems recovering from logging-related disturbances. Though short-lived
invertebrates and young fish may colonize disturbed sites, biological
stability and habitat complexity are slow to return. Twenty-five years
after clear-cut logging in the Alsea Watershed in the Oregon Coast
Range, cutthroat trout and coho salmon populations have not recovered.
In British Columbia, instability of large wood persists ten years after
logging. 
</P><P>Cumulative effects on downstream fish assemblages often reflect
watershed-scale disturbances. The legacy of diminished riparian forests
caused by previous forest practices already limits the function and
integrity of many existing watersheds. Ecosystem processes and
organization can also be "reset" by cumulative effects across a
landscape. More than ten percent of channel networks in the Cascade and
Coast ranges have been scoured by debris torrents related to logging
activities. These debris flows affect most directly second and third
order channels where salmon and trout spend the majority of their lives
in streams. Changes in floodplain dynamics, associated with altered
streambanks and wetlands, alter delivery of nutrients and food resources
to the streams, as well as eliminate nursery grounds for fish and
invertebrates. Cumulative effects of increased temperature and sediment
loads add to downstream degradation. Consequent losses in biological
diversity and abundance on a watershed-level basis can put entire stocks
of fish and other fauna at risk. 
</P><P>Uncertainties about the effectiveness of future practices, in
combination with questionable status of many fish stocks, demand prudent
and conservative actions that retain resource options for the future. 
</P>
<H4>Cumulative Effects Assessments: A Conceptual Framework</H4> 
<P>. . . Our conceptual framework for assessing the cumulative effects
of forestry practices on air, soils, water, aquatic biota, and wildlife
is based on the concepts that individual forest stands and their soils
are parts of: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>larger forests 
</LI>
<LI>watersheds of interconnected stream systems 
</LI>
<LI>interconnected wildlife habitat areas medium- and large-scale
landscape areas 
</LI>
<LI>airsheds (i.e., areas influenced by air masses moving from forests
of concern). 
</LI>
<LI><P>Additionally, forest ecosystems, their components, and many of
their properties are dynamic from hour to hour, day to day, rainstorm to
rainstorm, year to year, and decade to decade. Finally, it must be
emphasized that individual forest management activities at the site
level are the practices that ultimately cause cumulative effects.
Therefore, site-specific evaluations, determinations, and information
are essential. 
</P><P>Cumulative effects cannot be dealt with in a simple "linear"
context. They cannot be distilled into one or two equations,
correlations or box-and-arrow diagrams that suggest simple, static
conditions. They cannot be evaluated with a simple check list or form. .
. . Forested landscapes must be simultaneously viewed at multiple scales
of both time and space in order to understand and address cumulative
effects issues. 
</P><P>To develop a system for assessing the combined effects of
forestry practices and natural processes requires attention to details
at small temporal and spatial scales and sophisticated integration of
information at all scales. Such a system should encompass the following:

</P>
<UL>
<LI>Definitions and mapping of landscape units (stands, watersheds,
habitat areas, airsheds) for which cumulative effects analyses are
desired. 
</LI>
<LI>Assessments of ranges of natural variation and baseline conditions
for critical characteristics of each resource in each area of interest 
</LI>
<LI>Assessments of the probable impacts of past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future human activities on each resource and how
these impacts relate to current resource conditions (recognizing the
limits of evaluating historical changes). 
</LI>
<LI>Development of a geographic information system for placing each
forest operation in appropriate spatial context with adjacent or
otherwise logically-connected landscape units 
</LI>
<LI>Development and/or use of systems approaches for connecting
resource conditions and dynamics to forest practices that occur across
interacting landscape units 
</LI> 
</UL><P>Identification of levels of change for each resource
characteristic in order to evaluate whether specific cumulative effects
are acceptable or unacceptable. This process involves not only
accumulation and interpretation of factual information, but also
understanding of social preferences, valuation (ecologic and economic),
environmental and technological constraints, natural disturbance
regimes, and other factors.

the panel's responses are excerpted below. Emphasis  in the body of the
text is ats it appears in the report.</EM> 
</P>
<H4>Conclusions of the Study</H4> 
<P>. . . A decline in salmon status may result from two different
processes: 1) a decrease in geographic distribution - a loss in specific
stocks (whose likely result would be a decrease in genetic diversity);
and 2) a decline in overall numbers (including a decline in total legal
ocean and sport catch). 
</P><P>The two are sometimes treated as if they were the same, but they
are not. For example, there could be a loss of many stocks (local
extinction), while other stocks remain abundant. The extinction of
stocks, which were already at low abundance, might lead to a negligibly
small change in total numbers, but a large decrease in genetic
diversity. 
</P><P>The converse could also be true: there could be a large overall
decline in total numbers, but geographic distribution and genetic
diversity could be maintained. 
</P><P>In responding to the charges, it is necessary to clarify which
of these two phenomena has occurred, or perhaps that both have. It is
contrary to the goal of this study to presuppose a decline before
examining the available data. Therefore it is necessary to rephrase the
charges, replacing "decline" with "change in status." 
</P><P>Charge 1: "Identify leading causes, both onshore and offshore,
for anadromous fish population declines, if that is the case."  
</P><P>Except for sea-run cutthroat, the geographic distribution of
salmon has decreased for all species in the study area. Some stocks have
become locally extinct, others have so few adults returning to spawn as
to be considered endangered. There is no equivalent general trend for
total numbers. 
</P><P>The leading factors for changes in salmon populations as well as
the components or results of the factors are listed in Table 6. 
</P><P>Based on available data, it is the opinion of the panel that
<EM>agriculture, forestry, urbanization, over harvest through legal
catch, impediment construction (dams), and naturally occurring drought
are major factors in salmon declines.</EM> Potentially important factors
for which adequate data is lacking include unregulated and illegal
salmon harvest, gravel harvest, unfavorable ocean conditions, legal
bycatch and non-catch mortality, hatchery fish interference, and
irrigation. Marine, mammal and bird predation are minor factors. 
</P><P>Charge 2: "Assign the relative importance of forest practices to
these declines, compared to other leading causes." </P><P>The panel
believes that over the long term, forest practices have been a major
factor, along with agriculture, dams, drought, fish harvest, and
urbanization. If the ODF's [Oregon Department of Forestry] Water
Protection Rules (riparian rules) are carried out as written, then it is
the opinion of the panel that the negative effects of forest practices
will decline in the future. Whether or not these practices are adequate
or optimal for salmon is not known. Only through continued monitoring
and evaluation can that determination be made. 
</P><P>Stream and riparian conditions heavily dependent on forest
conditions, set an upper boundary to potential salmon production. For
example, clearcutting to the edge of a stream reduces potential salmon
production through such processes as increased erosion, simplification
of channel shape and form, loss of shade, reduction of woody input, and
reduction of supply of food and nutrients required by salmon. . . . 
</P><P>Which of the major factors are limiting the production of
salmon, averaged over the entire study area at present? The answer to
this is less clear. We do not know if the actual abundance of salmon is
at present limited by the conditions of all stream and riparian zones
together, or if some other factors, such as climate, ocean currents, or
ocean fishing, are restricting the number of returning adults below the
potential level that existing stream and riparian conditions provide.
This uncertainty is a result of the lack of adequate
statistically-reliable data for the number of returning adults. The
period for which data are available on the Rogue and the Umpqua [the
rivers where data are best - ed.] is not sufficiently long to reveal
effects of the processes of forest development and ocean dynamics. . . .

</P><P>Charge 6: "Make recommendations as to how forest practices can
assist in recovery of anadromous fish populations." 
</P><P>The response to Charge 6 is organized in four sections: 1)
actions to improve salmon habitat related to forest practices; 2)
actions to improve salmon habitat or enhance salmon survival not
directly related to forest practices; 3) measurement needs related to
forest practices; and 4) measurement needs not directly related to
forest practices. 
</P><P>1) Actions to improve salmon habitat related to forest
practices:  
</P><UL>
<LI>Continue to regulate forest operations to protect riparian habitat.
</LI>
<LI>Continue to create incentives for habitat restoration in
conjunction with forest operations. 
</LI>
<LI>Develop a management strategy for an adequate loading of LWD [large
woody debris] such as bringing logs to areas that lack sufficient large
streamside trees. Measurement must be part of this strategy, including
before and after monitoring, to determine the ecological effectiveness
and cost effectiveness of different methods. 
</LI>
<LI>Assess how recent technical and regulatory innovations in forest
road construction have affected sediment supply to streams. 
</LI>
<LI></LI>
<LI>Maintain permanent forest roads at a level sufficient to avoid
major washouts or chronic erosion. 
</LI>
<LI>Where possible, close as many previously constructed logging roads
as is feasible. 
</LI>
<LI>Monitor and evaluate on a continuing basis the effectiveness of
ODF's Water Protection Rules (riparian rules) to determine if riparian
zone buffers are adequate for the protection of salmon and their
habitat. It is the opinion of the panel that these rules may not provide
sufficient loading of LWD to the stream channel, especially in the short
term in secondary forests.

<H3>Expert Panel Recommends Ecosystem Management</H3> 
<P><EM>Editor's note: </EM>
</P><P><EM>To most Americans outside of government and academia, the
National Research Council is probably not very well known. Founded in
1916 as the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences, an
organization of the most eminent scientists in the United States, the
Research Council is designed to provide advice to the government,
specifically Congress. The Research Council convenes panels of experts
to provide advice on topical concerns. This summer, the 17-member
Committee on Scientific Issues in the Endangered Species Act (ESA)
issued its report. 
</EM></P><P><EM>The result of two years of review of the federal law,
the approximately 200-page report supports the law resoundingly. 
</EM></P><BLOCKQUOTE>"To sustain a viable future for our descendants,
we must find ways to preserve both species and ecosystems," wrote
Michael T. Clegg in his preface to the report. "The ESA is a critically
important part of our efforts to conserve species and thereby conserve
ecosystems." Clegg, the chair of the committee, is a professor of
genetics and dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, University of
California, Riverside. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><P><EM>Excerpted below, from the conclusion of the
report, is a section titled "The Future: Beyond the Endangered Species
Act." 
</EM></P>
<P>The ESA and other existing programs will not by themselves prevent
all future extinctions of species in the United States. It appears to
the committee that Congress intended the ESA to be a safety net to
protect endangered species, and the committee concludes that that is its
proper role. However - and this is not entirely the fault of the ESA -
species often will be in serious trouble by the time they receive ESA
protection. 
</P><P>The director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, Mollie Beattie,
holds a similar view. She said (as quoted by the Jackson Hole News,
February 8, 1995): "The Endangered Species Act is . . . a law that plays
in when local planning and zoning, state fish and wildlife efforts, the
Clean Water Act, and Clean Air Act haven't worked. It is the emergency
room of conservation policy." 
</P>
<H4>Ecosystem Management</H4> 
<P>If species extinctions are to be prevented, a broader management
approach will be needed to complement the ESA's protections. A few
thoughts on that broader approach - ecosystem management - are
appropriate here. 
</P><P>The goal of an ecosystem-based approach to managing natural
resources is to maintain biological diversity by recognizing the value
of protecting an array of biological communities and habitat types
within a larger landscape context. Ecosystem-focused programs are
probably most useful when individual elements of biological communities
are not in so much trouble that they need narrowly targeted management
efforts. Using an ecosystem perspective for endangered species
conservation planning offers several advantages. First, species needs
are viewed in the context of surrounding land uses, rather than within
the limits of their currently occupied habitat. Because surrounding land
uses and the distribution of habitat patches among them can strongly
influence species welfare, resource managers can identify future
opportunities and constraints. 
</P><P>Second, the complexity of the problems facing managers who
develop and implement strategies for conservation of endangered species
requires new concepts. The expected rapid pace of new listings coupled
with funding limitations places a premium on approaches that address the
needs of different species simultaneously. 
</P><P>Recently developed tools, such as advances in remote sensing,
population-viability-analysis models, decision-analysis methods, and
geographic information systems increase our ability to analyze complex
problems involving interactions among diverse influences and the
implications of various possible solutions. Gap analysis can provide a
process to identify areas of high biological diversity or those
containing several protected species with overlapping ranges. It can
also be used to develop a coarse overview of resource status and land
uses across political boundaries. 
</P><P>Additional management approaches related to ecosystem management
show promise. They include the following: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Reconstruction or rehabilitation of ecosystems. Restoration ecology
is a growing discipline. Many ecosystems [sic] functions have been
improved or restored by such activities, and reconstruction or
rehabilitation of ecosystem functioning holds much promise for the
protection of endangered species. It is not usually possible to return
an ecosystem to some prior pristine condition, however. Many ecosystems
have been so altered that it is difficult to decide what prior condition
we might want to return to. The trajectory taken by the ecosystem to get
to its current condition is not retraceable in the way that a highway
is, because many events occur in an ecosystem's history that are not
precisely reversible. Genetic variability is lost; evolution occurs;
exotic species are introduced; human populations in the region increase,
and people develop dependence on a variety of modern technologies,
cultures, and economic systems; and other natural and anthropogenic
environmental changes affect the range of biophysical and socioeconomic
possibilities for future states of the system. In brief, the past
provides opportunities for the future but also constrains it. Thus,
attempts to rehabilitate ecosystem functioning should keep these
constraints in mind, so that inappropriately high expectations are not
generated.  
</LI>
<LI>Mixed management plans. Often, resource managers manage areas
either for protection of biota or for human use. It is increasingly
difficult to keep people and the effects of their activities separate
from wildlife sanctuaries. Although such sanctuaries (e.g., national
parks, wilderness areas, wildlife refuges, marine sanctuaries) are
indispensable for protecting endangered species, greater attention needs
to be paid to developing mixed-use areas. These would be urban
recreation areas or residential and commercial developments adjacent to
untrammeled areas designed to improve opportunities for wildlife while
maintaining opportunities for human activities. Although the value of
this approach is becoming increasingly recognized, its development is
still in the early stages. 
</LI>
<LI>Cooperative management. Various experiences with cooperative
management - the sharing of planning and decision making by various
government and nongovernment groups - have had some success. To some
degree, habitat conservation plans represent an example of this
approach, but it is likely that cooperative management will be necessary
in cases where the strict requirements of the Endangered Species Act
have not yet been applied. It is important to include the major
interested parties without having so many interests involved that
consensus is difficult to reach. 
</LI>
<LI>Revised economic accounting. Too often, economic calculations
underlying public and private decision making are incomplete. Often,
they cover too short a time span, and they often exclude nonmarket
values. A short-term loss might turn into a long-term gain: for example,
losing an economic activity today might provide opportunities for
greater economic activities of different types at some time in the
future. Again, the validity of expanding economic accounting to cover
longer periods and to include nonmarket values is becoming more widely
recognized but it is still in the early stages of development.

<P><EM>By Robert T. Lackey</EM>
</P><P><EM>Editor's note: </EM>
</P><em>"Ecosystem management," Robert Lackey writes, "is
widely proposed in the popular and professional literature as the modern
and preferred way of managing natural resources and ecosystems.
Advocates glowingly describe ecosystem management as an approach that
will protect the environment, maintain healthy ecosystems, preserve
biological diversity, and ensure sustainable development. Critics scoff
at the concept as a new label for old ideas." 
</em><P><EM>In a recent essay, "Seven Pillars of Ecosystem
Management," Lackey argues that the words and concepts of ecosystem
management are often vague, and he offers seven core principles to make
the term clearer and give it, as he says, "operational meaning." Two of
his discussions are excerpted here.
</EM></P>
<H4>Health</H4> 
<P>The terms ecological "health" and ecological "integrity" are widely
used by scientists and politicians. Ecosystems, it is said, should be
managed to achieve a healthy state or to maintain ecological integrity.
(By implication those who advocate otherwise would seem to be relegated
to managing for "sick" ecosystems.) 
</P><P>Scientists often speak and write about monitoring the health of
an ecosystem or perhaps the integrity of the ecosystem. There is usually
the assumption that there is an intrinsic state of health or integrity
and other, lesser states of health or integrity, for any given
ecosystem. Some scientists explicitly advocate ". . . that maintaining
ecosystem integrity should take precedence over any other management
goal."<A HREF="#footnote">*</A>
</P><P>Much of the general public seems to accept that there must be a
technically defined healthy state similar to their personal human
health. After all, people know how they feel when they are sick, and so,
by extension, a sick ecosystem must be a similar condition, which should
be avoided. Health is a powerful metaphor in the world of competing
policy alternatives. 
</P><P>For example, society may wish to manage a watershed to maximize
opportunities for viewing the greatest possible diversity of birds, or
for the greatest sustained yield of timber or of agricultural products.
Achieving each goal would almost assuredly result in ecosystems that
were very different, but equally "healthy." 
</P><P>The debate is really over defining the "desired" state of the
ecosystem, and secondarily, managing the ecosystem to achieve the
desired state. Phrased another way: what kind of garden does society
want? There is no intrinsic definition of health without a benchmark of
the desired condition. 
</P><P>In ecosystem management, scientists should avoid value-laden
terms such as "degradation," "sick," "destroy," "safe," "exploitation,"
"collapse," and "crisis," unless they are accompanied with an explicit
definition of what the desired condition of the ecosystem is as defined
by society. The word "society," as used here, only includes humans. 
</P><P>In philosophical terms, the problem with "health" is how does
one link "is" and "ought." 
</P><P>For example, an ecosystem has certain characteristics - these
are facts on which all analysts who study the ecosystem should be able
to agree. Characteristics such as species diversity, productivity, and
carbon cycling are examples. If the same definitions and the same
methods are used, all analysts should come to the same answer within the
range of system and analytical variability. 
</P><P>The "ought" must involve human judgement - it cannot be
determined by scientific or technical analysis. The concept of "health"
has a compelling appeal, but it has no operational meaning unless it is
defined in terms of the desired state of the ecosystem. 
</P><P>The third pillar of ecosystem management is 
</P><P><EM>Ecosystem management should maintain ecosystems in the
appropriate condition to achieve desired social benefits; the desired
social benefits are defined by society, not scientists.</EM>
</P>
<H4>Stability</H4> 
<P>Stability, resilience, fragility, and adaptability are interesting
and challenging concepts in ecology. These are some of the
characteristics of ecosystems that provide an opportunity to realize
benefits for society. But these same characteristics constrain options
for society and the ecosystem manager. Stability and the related
concepts are very difficult to describe clearly because of the
variations in definition for all the terms associated with this topic.
Particular care must be taken to be sure that differences in opinion are
not due to differences in definition. 
</P><P>There is a widespread, if sometimes latent, view that ecosystems
are best that have not been altered by man. Further, it just seems
obvious that such "healthy" ecosystems must be more stable than the
altered, less "healthy" ones, just as the Romantic School viewed nature
as a noble world that realized its greatest perfection when not affected
by man. This is the classic "balance of nature" view. Pristine is good;
altered is bad - perhaps necessary for food, lodging, or transport, but
still not as desirable as pristine. However, few seem to be willing to
return to the "natural" human mortality rates of at least 50 percent
from birth to age five. 
</P><P>Moreover, this is not how nature works. There is no "natural"
state in nature; it is a relative concept. The only thing natural is
change, sometimes somewhat predictable, oftentimes random, or at least
unpredictable. It would be nice if it were otherwise, but it is not. The
concept of dynamic equilibrium might place bounds on ecosystem change in
an intellectual attempt to describe better stability, but the intuitive
appeal of the concept of stability is not easily fulfilled. Some
ecologists cling to traditional concepts of stability and equilibrium
with a near missionary zeal. 
</P><P>Ecosystems are resilient, although not without limits. A key
role of science in ecosystem management is to identify the limits or
constraints that bound the options to achieve various societal benefits.
The trick in management is to balance the ability of ecosystems to
respond to stress (including use or modification) in desirable ways, but
without altering the ecosystem beyond its ability to provide those
benefits. We want shelter, food, personal mobility, energy, etc., but we
do not want the systems to collapse that are producing those benefits. 
</P><P>The fourth pillar of ecosystem management is <EM>Ecosystem
management can take advantage of the ability of ecosystems to respond to
a variety of stressors, natural and man-made, but there is a limit in
the ability of all ecosystems to accommodate stressors and maintain a
desired state.</EM>

<H4>Coastal Coho Proposed for Threatened Listing</H4> 
<P>On July 18, the National Marine Fisheries Service proposed to
protect wild coastal coho salmon under the federal Endangered Species
Act. The fish would be listed as threatened from Monterey, California,
to the Columbia River. "We're talking about [protecting] millions and
millions of acres of habitat, much of it in private hands," said
fisheries service spokesman Brian Gorman. The agency will gather public
testimony during the next year before making a final decision on
listing. Political observers doubt whether the agency will list the
species next year, a presidential election year. <CITE>(Source:

<H4>Physicians Urge Reauthorization of Strong ESA</H4> 
<P>While Congress considers major revisions to the federal Endangered
Species Act, many specialists urge the politicians to keep the ESA
strong. In a July 5 letter to members of Congress, Physicians for Social
Responsibility said that "the Endangered Species Act has dramatically
protected and enhanced public health [and] it is imperative that this
law remain strong." They noted that "of the top 150 prescription drugs
in the United States, 79% are derived from natural sources." These drugs
"are the product of millions of years of evolution, and could not be
invented by the mind of man." The organization also argued the "folly"
of conducting cost-benefit analysis for species without knowing the
medicinal value of biodiversity. <CITE>(Source: ESA Today, 7/18/95)

<br>
APEGBC sets the standards for licensure as a Professional Engineer or
Professional Geoscientist in B.C. Minimum requirements include graduation
from an accredited engineering or science undergraduate program at a Canadian
university and four years of related work experience, demonstrating ever
increasing responsibility and competence in the chosen field of work. Applicants
with degrees from non-Canadian universities will have their academic status
evaluated with respect to the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB)
standards and may be assigned examinations to confirm academic sufficiency.<BR>
<BR>
The Association is empowered under the <I>Engineers and Geoscientists Act</I>
 to regulate and enforce the practices of engineering and geoscience in
British Columbia. The Association carries out its regulatory mandate to
advance and maintain high standards of admission and practice by preventing
the unlicensed practice of engineering and geoscience by non-qualified individuals,
as well as by investigating and acting on evidence of unprofessional or
unethical conduct or negligence on the part of a member. <BR>
<BR>
This obligation was first granted to the Association in 1920 and since that
time APEGBC has ensured that high standards of practice are maintained in
B.C. Certainly, the growth of the Association, from its modest beginnings
and approximately 200 members in 1920 to a membership exceeding 17,000 in
1996, is testament to the importance and dedication of these men and women
and to the emerging dominance of British Columbia as a Canadian engineering
leader.<BR>

Professional Engineers and Geoscientists Foundation!</FONT></H3>

<STRONG><P>The Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists Foundation
(The Foundation) was established in 1994 as a registered charity. Its goals
are to enhance education in engineering and geoscience through bursaries,
scholarships and grants, and to encourage professional development and
continuing education for members and members-in-training.</P>

<P>Member and corporate contributions over the past two years have enabled
The Foundation to meet its initial goal of raising $100,000. However, with
current low investment rates, this capital will only produce between $4,000
and $5,000 annually for distribution. Over $8,000 in scholarships and grants
has been distributed to date in 1996, resulting in a net decline in the
capital base.</P>

<P>Your continued support is needed to help The Foundation expand its programs.
The trustees have approved the formation of two, $2,000 entry scholarships
for secondary students entering undergraduate engineering or geoscience
programs in British Columbia, complementing the existing six, $1,000 awards
for deserving second year undergraduates. Scholarships for post- graduate
study by members and funding for other continuing education programs and
technical conferences are also high on the list of future programs.</P>

<P>Your tax-deductible donation can be made with your fee renewal payment
by indicating the desired amount on the line provided. A separate charitable
receipt will be issued.</P>

<P>Your contribution will help make education available to current and
future professional engineers and geoscientists. Please consider giving
the gift of education this year.</P>

<P>Yours truly,<BR>
<BR>

relative to the Uniform Syllabus of Examinations endorsed by CCPE. 
</OL>
Special consideration may be given to an applicant who: 
<OL>
<LI>does not meet the formal education requirements but is generally recognized
as an expert in an engineering specialty; or 
<LI>has provided satisfactory evidence of being particularly well-qualified
in a discipline of engineering as judged by the depth and breadth of his/her
academic education and experience. 
</OL>
<H4><I>Work Experience Requirements</I></H4>
The minimum length of experience required for registration as a Professional
Engineer is four years. A candidate whose experience is in an area markedly
different from the discipline of the applicant s degree may be required
to have longer experience to qualify. In general, only experience that follows
completion of the academic requirements is considered satisfactory, although,
under exceptional circumstances, partial credit may be given for outstanding
experience received prior to graduation.<BR>
<BR>
A candidate who has a post-graduate degree in the same discipline as his/her
undergraduate degree may be given some credit for the time taken in earning
the degree, up to a maximum of one year for a master s degree and one additional
year for a doctorate, provided that a substantial component of application
of engineering principles are demonstrated in earning the degree. This is
likely to occur when there is a strong research component to the studies.
<H4><I>The Professional Practice Examination</I></H4>
With the exception of applicants who have passed a similar examination for
another Canadian Association and those who have been professional members
of another Canadian Association for at least five years immediately preceding
application, every applicant for registration, non-resident licence or limited
licence is required to pass a 3-hour, closed-book Professional Practice
examination, that covers the Act, Bylaws and Code of Ethics, Contract Law
and Liability, Negligence, Intellectual Property, and Business Associations.
An additional topic is included; Builder Liens for engineering applicants
and Mines Act, Mineral Tenure Act and Workers Compensation Act for geoscience
applicants. All questions are either true/false or multiple choice. There
is also an essay question intended to demonstrate the applicant's ability
to communicate effectively in English. The essay question is treated as
a separate examination. Candidates must pass both the main examination and
the essay question. 
<H4>Engineer-in-Training</H4>
Applicants who have not yet obtained the necessary four years of satisfactory
work experience are enroled as Engineers-in-Training if they meet the academic
and citizenship requirements. During the four-year program, Engineers-in-Training
keep a log book to provide a chronological, written record of work experience
and professional development. The log is initialed by the EIT's engineering
supervisor and should be updated monthly or more frequently. The Association
provides the opportunity for an EIT's log book to be reviewed at the end
of two years' experience, prior to an optional mid-term interview.

<A NAME="anchor853314"></A>Limited Licensee</H3>
Limited Licence is a category of licensure for individuals whose academic
qualifications and experience is not sufficient for them to become registered
as full members that authorizes qualified individuals to practise within
a specifically and strictly limited scope of work. Under this licence, they
are permitted to carry out certain specific functions, normally within the
definition of the practices of professional engineering or geoscience, and
to do so independently and without the supervision of a Professional Engineer
or Professional Geoscientist.<BR>
<BR>
To qualify, one must satisfy both academic and experience requirements relative
to the limited scope proposed. Licensure is limited to qualified Canadian
citizens and permanent residents (landed immigrants) of Canada. Individuals
not meeting the citizenship requirement may apply for a non-resident limited
licence. Note that in all cases, at least one year of the required work
experience must have been obtained in Canada or the United States. 
<H4><I>Academic Requirements</I></H4>
One of the following must be satisfied as a minimum requirement: 
<OL>
<LI>graduation with a science degree in a discipline and from a university
program approved by the Association; 
<LI>registration as an applied science technologist with a degree or diploma
in engineering technology or geoscience technology in a program and from
an institution approved by the Association; or 
<LI>other qualifications acceptable to the council of the Association. 
</OL>
<H4><I>Work Experience Requirements</I></H4>
Every applicant for a Limited Licence must have eight years of experience
in engineering or geoscience work satisfactory to the Council of the Association.
The eight years may contain up to four years spent in post-secondary training
required for academic qualification. As a minimum, the last two years of
the experience must have been gained in engineering or geoscience practice
within the scope of the licence being sought and supervised by a Professional
Engineer or Professional Geoscientist. A minimum of one year of the work
experience must have been obtained in Canada or the United States. 
<H4><I>The Job-site Interview</I></H4>
Each applicant for a Limited Licence will be subject to a &quot;job-site&quot;
interview. During this interview, the practice of the applicant will be
reviewed and he/she will be expected to demonstrate familiarity with codes
and regulations that are applicable to the practice in British Columbia,
including the quality management practices outlined in the Bylaws of the
Association. 
<H4><I>The Professional Practice Examination</I></H4>
With the exception of applicants who have passed a similar examination for
another Canadian Association and those who have been professional members
of another Canadian Association for at least five years immediately preceding
application, every applicant for registration, non-resident licence or limited
licence is required to pass a 3-hour, closed-book Professional Practice
examination, that covers the Act, Bylaws and Code of Ethics, Contract Law
and Liability, Negligence, Intellectual Property, and Business Associations.

<h2>Three BC Schools Compete in CANADA FIRST<br></h2></center>

Teams from Prince of Wales, Richmond, and Oak Bay Secondary Schools travelled to
Scarborough to compete in the Third Annual CANADA FIRST Robotic Games.  The goal of the
competition is for students to design and build a remotely controlled robot that can collect balls
from the playing field and deposit them in the team's goal.   The competition is run in heats, with
up to four robots competing at once.  In addition to competing, the teams must also produce a
report and video about their robot.  The competition is designed to give teens "hands-on"
involvement in science and technology.  Engineering mentors from sponsoring corporations
function as "coaches" to assist the team, but the project is student-driven.<P>

     Eighteen teams competed this year.  Teams ranged in size from 12 to 92 students.  The Prince
of Wales team consisted of 35 students, 1 teacher, and 6 engineer mentors; Richmond had 24, 1,
and 11; and Oak Bay had 27, 1, and 6.<P>

     It was the second year of competition for Prince of Wales and they built a very good robot. 
Unfortunately, they missed the semifinals by one point.<P>

     Fundraising is a big part of the preparation for the competition, as the competition fee is
$8,000 and transportation and accommodation is even more.  The APEGBC Career Awareness
Committee (CAC) helped sponsor he Prince of Wales team.  Planning is
under way for a western regional competition, which would require fewer financial
resources.<P>

     The CAC would like to congratulate all of the BC teams on their hard work in designing and
building their robots and also like to thank all of the engineering mentors for getting involved
and helping to promote careers in engineering!<BR><BR>

<BR>
Scientists & Innovators in the Schools, SIS, is a program that sends out scientists, engineers, and
technologists to schools throughout B.C.  The purpose of these visits is to make a positive impact
on students' willingness to continue with science and math, and they also keep teachers informed
about the latest scientific developments.  SIS is in its sixth year of operation and is being used as
a model for the rest of the country.  SIS  has received the Conference Board of Canada's National
Award for Excellence in Business-Education Partnerships and the 1995 Michael Smith Award
for Science Promotion.<P>

During the 1994/95 school year, SIS received 1,743 requests for school visits, and volunteers
visited 95,800 students in 3,832 classes.  The number of students visited was up 39 percent from
1993/94.<P>

In addition to matching volunteers with schools, SIS is involved in a variety of other projects. 
The first pilot project with the North Coast Tribal Council Educational Centre took place this
year.  The project combined "western" science with First Nations tradition.<P>

There are currently 441 volunteers registered in the program, including 61 PEng's/PGeo's and
seven EITs.  All volunteers are offered training at hands-on workshops.  The following
workshops are scheduled for next school year:<P>

<OL>
     <LI> January 18, 1997    Nanaimo
     <LI>February 15              Vancouver

<BR>
APASE, the Association for the Promotion and  Advancement of Science Education, is a non-
profit society and registered charity that has been educating BC for 13 years through hands-on
workshops, colourful publications, interactive TV and the Internet.  All of these resources
emphasize discovery-learning and demonstrate the relevance of science and the environment to
everyday life through the fundamental principles of gender equity and multicultural diversity.<P>

APASE's "Bridging the Gap" training workshops partner teachers with engineers and scientists,
providing both with opportunities to learn about each other's professions while learning hands-on
classroom science and engineering activities.  In translating the reality of their jobs into fun,
engaging activities for children, science role models infuse teachers and their students with
science knowledge and enthusiasm.<P>

Another APASE workshop is called "Engineering for Children Challenge - Building Bridges
with Mentors".  Paired with a scientist or engineer, children aged 7 to 13 participate in a science
experience, designing and building innovative structures.  Faced with an exciting challenge and
new skills, children and their engineering role models build spaghetti bridges, newspaper
structures, and numerous Rube Goldberg inventions.  During last year's Science and Technology
Week, APASE and APEGBC staged a similar event called "Sailing Science" on the ferry Spirit
of BC's Vancouver-Victoria sailings.<P>

APASE special events provide an opportunity for community involvement, enhance public
awareness of science and engineering, and serve as a focus for career discussions between
teacher and student, parent and child.  APASE is always looking for keen and energetic people
interested in volunteering time as a mentor.  For more information or to book a workshop,
contact Rani MacInnes, Project Manager:  tel (604) 687-8712, fax (604) 687-8715, or

<STRONG>Many Canadians may be aware of the Iron Ring worn by friends, associates
or family members who work or have practised in the field of engineering.
To most, this singularly unusual adornment probably appears to be some sort
of arcane sign - like the secret handshake or the unusual headdress that
signifies membership in a mysterious order. While this image has been perpetuated
for many years by the privacy surrounding the Iron Ring, the reality is
otherwise.<BR>
<BR>
The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer, or Kipling Ritual, is a ceremony
that was developed in 1923 for engineers graduating from Canadian universities.
The post-war years were a time of growth and prosperity that fueled the
quest for greater engineering achievements. The accelerating pace of technological
change called on engineers to push the bounds of applied science ever farther
and farther. To remind the young graduates of the obligations they were
accepting upon entry into the hallowed halls of professional practice, the
engineering leaders of the day called upon the celebrated author, Rudyard
Kipling, to develop a ritual ceremony that would symbolize the responsibilities
the young engineers were about to face.<BR>
<BR>
The ceremony calls on all engineering graduates to make an obligation to
strive to perform work and assignments to the best of their ability. A ring
made of iron, one of the first modern materials used to forge a new world
by our ancestors, is worn on the small finger of the working hand and acts
as a reminder of this obligation. This ceremony is performed across Canada each spring and often
marks the transition from student
life to a career in engineering.<BR>
<BR>
The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer marks the end of stage one on the
path towards full registration as a Professional Engineer in Canada. To
become fully qualified and licensed as a Professional Engineer in B.C.,
an engineering graduate must complete four years of practical work experience,
demonstrating ever-increasing responsibility and competence in professional
practice. Only after undertaking this &quot;apprenticeship&quot; and demonstration
of competence in front of one's peers can an engineering graduate become
registered as a fully Licensed Professional Engineer and use the designation
P.Eng. after his/her name. Only licensed members of the Association of Professional
Engineers and Geoscientists of BC are entitled to practise professional
engineering in British Columbia. We're sure you wouldn't want it any other
way!<BR>
<BR>

University but wish to take the obligation to receive an Iron Ring may contact
the closest Camp to register for the next available ceremony.<BR></STRONG>

<h2><font size="+3">Call for Nominations</font></h2>

<p><img src="cloudsb.gif" align="bottom" ></center><br><br>
Do you know of a professional engineer or professional geoscientist who has made an
outstanding contribution to the professions, the community or APEGBC that should be more
widely known? We'd like to know, so that we can tell the world -- or, at least, British Columbia
-- about him or her.  

<p>We want to give members who go the extra distance in their professional, business and
community lives the recognition they so richly deserve for their technical and non-technical
accomplishments -- and we want to make their peers, and the citizens of BC, aware of their
exceptional talents. But we need your input.  

<p>This is <strong>your</strong> opportunity to tell us about a fellow member who typifies the
dedication to
excellence associated with our professions. We urge you to nominate a deserving individual for
one of the following awards:<br>
<strong><center>(see below for the link to the nomination form)</strong></center>

<p align="center"><img src="cloudsb.gif" align="bottom" ><br></center><br>

<p><center><strong>The R A McLachlan Memorial Award</strong></center><br>
This award was established in 1965 in honour of R. A. McLachlan P.Eng. Mr.
McLachlan was President of the Association in 1951 and a member of Council in 1940, 1941,
1945, 1950 and 1952. He served the Association in many ways and maintained an unflagging
interest in its affairs. He was highly respected by all who knew him, both for his ability as an
engineer and for his personal integrity and fairness. Prior to his retirement in 1963, he was the
Chief Engineer, Pacific Division of Dominion Bridge Company Limited.

<P>This award shall be made to an engineer or geoscientist who combines a solid professional
career with outstanding service to the community. It is intended that the award be given to a
candidate who has exhibited the concern for public welfare that characterizes our professions at
their best. The candidate should be actively engaged in professional work as opposed to one who
has done such work in the past but has gone on to administrative or other non-technical duties.

<P>Community service that will be considered most desirable in a candidate includes:<br>
<UL>
<LI>election to parliament or legislature as an MP or MLA
<LI>election to regional or municipal councils or boards
<LI>completion of a period of major responsibility with a charitable organization such as the
United Way, Red Cross, Salvation Army or similar organization
<LI> major executive responsibility for youth or church groups, service organizations or
<LI>community sports or recreation clubs and boards
</UL>
<P>Professional or technical society activity may be considered. However, activity related to the
furtherance of the career of a candidate will be given less weight than community activity as
referred to above. Greater weight will be given for either a sustained period of community
activity or for participation in a number of different activities.

<p><center><strong>The Christopher J Westerman Memorial Award</strong></center><br>
This award was established in 1994 in honour of Dr. C. J. Westerman, P.Geo., who was regarded
by his peers as an eminent and exemplary member of the geoscience community and the
Association. In addition to his high standards of professionalism and excellence in practice, Dr.
Westerman was instrumental in establishing the licensing and accreditation of Professional
Geoscientists in British Columbia. These qualities, along with his dedication and commitment
through countless hours of volunteer work on behalf of the Association, are commemorated in
this award.

<P>The Christopher J. Westerman Memorial Award is the Association's primary award for
professional geoscience. The award is given to a Professional Geoscientist who advances public
recognition of the practice of professional geoscience in British Columbia and does so with the
high levels of dedication and integrity shown by Dr. Westerman. The candidate will be actively
engaged in the practice of geoscience and will have demonstrated a solid professional career with
outstanding service to the community.

<p><center><strong>The Meritorious Achievement Award</strong></center><br>
The Meritorious Achievement Award is presented to APEGBC members who have achieved
distinctive and outstanding goals in professional or technical fields. The achievement may be a
single event or the culmination of activity towards the goal. Among achievements that might be
considered are the discovery of a new process or procedure, leadership of a team that reaches
national or international distinction or achievement of a goal against considerable odds through
determination and personal drive.

<p align="center"><img src="cloudsb.gif" align="bottom" ><br></center><br>

<p><center><strong>The Community Service Award</strong></center>
The Community Service Award is presented to APEGBC members who have made a substantial
contribution to the well-being of their community. The contribution may be in one or more of the
fields of social service, church work, politics, education, sport, recreation or the arts. The
contribution may be through either voluntary or paid service, elected or appointed. Continuous
activity over a period is an asset.

<p align="center"><img src="cloudsb.gif" align="bottom" ><br></center><br>

<p><center><strong>The Professional Service Award</strong></center><br>
The Professional Service Award is presented to APEGBC members who have made a substantial
contribution of service to the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of BC or
to technical and learned societies and organizations. The service will include leadership and
dedication to the Association or to other societies over a sustained period of time.

REVIEW</strong></font><br>
     <img width=570 src="rainbow.gif"></center><br>
     <p>Engineering in British Columbia is subject to numerous codes and regulations, many are
the<br>
     responsibility of the Provincial Government. Based on demands from many sectors, the
Ministry<br>
     of Municipal Affairs and Housing has initiated the <a
href="http://www.marh.gov.bc.ca/SSR/">Safety Systems Review</a> to look at how the<br>
     codes are applied and what effect they have, with a view to re-engineering and improving
the<br>
     process.</p>
     <p>Hundreds of participants from both the private and public sectors have been involved in
the<br>
     review through work groups looking at a variety of aspects of the application of codes
from<br>
     education to insurance, from design to maintenance.</p>
     <p>Whether you are in manufacturing, construction, design or operation you will be affected
by the<br>
     outcome of the review. Come to the meeting to hear where the review is headed and put in
your<br>
     two cents worth!</p></TD>

<H3>The No. 2 Road Bridge linking Vancouver International Airport with Richmond, provides
direct access to the city's central core. The bridge is constructed of pre-cast transverse sections,
one
of which is shown being lowered into position. Using sophisticated pre-construction
methodology
and final on-site assembly, significant savings in cost are effected.</H3>

<H3>With the increasing demand for wood strands for engineered lumber and wood composites,
CAE Machinery ltd., the world's leading supplier of disk flakes, has designed its Model 28/81
Strander. The requirement for minimum down time led to a patented design of cutting ring
removal,
which allows for major servicing in an 8-hour shut down period.</H3>

</CENTER>

<H3>This perspective view of Bowen Island was generated using a Geographic Information
System
(GIS). Contour information and spot height data are used to generate the surface from which GIS
is
then capable of generating perspective views from different azimuths and altitudes. Other data
such
as roads and property boundaries can be draped on top of the view. The soft ware is also capable
of
generating analytical hill shading which simulates sun shadowing from selected azimuths and
altitudes. Features which have been draped on this surface include lakes, ocean, roads and
cadastral
information.  The Bowen Island map is a project-in-process by the Bowen Island Forest and
Water
Management Society to collate and refine the existing island maps. When completed, this map
will
act as a benchmark for land use planning as part of the completion of the new Bowen Island
Official
Community Plan. The map was produced by E S R I Canada using E S R I's Arc/Info GIS
software.</H3>

<H3>This Automated Light Rail Transit system was built in 3 sections: Phase I, a 21.4 km
section
from Vancouver to New Westminster; Phase II, a Fraser River crossing; and, Phase III an
extension
to Surrey.  Klohn-Crippen within the H.A. Simons Group in association with Daniel Mann
Johnson
and Mendenhall was principal consultant for design of various line sections and management and
supervision of all final design subcontracts during Phase I.  Klohn-Crippen also carried out
design
and engineering services for 3 stations in Surrey.</H3>

<H3>Flash floods along stream courses on the Sea to Sky highway destroyed many of the old
wooden bridges. The hazard factor of these extreme slopes necessitated an upgrading of the
highway. 
The Newman Bridge is an example of pre-cast, pre-tensioned structural concrete construction,
permitting maximum benefits of span, flexibility, and installation speed in the final assembly on
a
highly utilized traffic corridor.</H3>

<H3>PERFform is one of a series of ergonomic lighting solutions and features a unique
semi-linear
design based on a continuous extruded aluminum spine  with four foot optical modules attached.
The
translucent modules are made from perforated metal with an opal diffusing membrane .
PERFform
also features a unique adjustable corner. The mostly indirect optical system has an efficiency in
the
mid 80% range, making it an appropriate choice for projects where low watt density is a design
requirement.</H3>

Trans
Canada Highway and East Hastings Street. A cut and cover tunnel, approximately 730 metres
long
and designed for 6 lanes of traffic, is longitudinally ventilated using jet fans hanging from the
ceiling, the first such design for a vehicular tunnel in North America. Other firms who
contributed
to this project are Keen Engineering and MA Thomas.</H3>

<H3>In order to minimize the number of 900 MHz radio hops between a central dispatch facility
in Duncan and a remote VHF base
station site near Lake Cowichan, line of site studies were conducted from both sites and the
resulting plots overlaid on a map to determine potential locations for a single repeater site. An
area in the Cowichan Station area was identified. Field inspections were conducted to identify
several possible
sites and radio path testing was carried out to verify a single site where the repeater is now
implemented.

<P>
The Texas Environmental Center is creating a community resource the likes of which you've never seen before!  This Project features full stereo sound, movie clips,  music, animation. . . simply the best of what there is on Barton Springs!
<P>
Hear a man tell a story of his life-changing baptism in Barton Springs 60 years ago.  Travel with narrator Liz Carpenter to a picnic at the Springs lovingly recorded in a diary over a hundred years ago.  Learn how the aquifer works with an interactive model that allows the user to change the flow rates and see the effects of impervious cover.  Learn the day-to-day challenges of a hydro-geologist, an urban planner, a civil engineer, or a field biologist, who all work with the Springs and the Aquifer regularly.  
<P>
<FONT COLOR=RED><FONT SIZE=+2>The Goal</B></FONT></FONT COLOR> of this Project is to deliver--in the most compelling way possible--the rich human history of the Springs, the science behind how the aquifer works and the scientific and cultural factors that affect water quality. 
<P>

<H2>Texas and the Environmental Challenge</H2>


One of America's last frontiers, the great state of Texas encompasses a
tremendous range of biological, climatic and cultural diversity. Texas posseses
one of the richest natural heritages in the United States: pineywoods, prairie,
marsh, plains, plateaus, savannas, mountains, and coast. Included in this natural
array are 5,000 species of plants, including 2,000 different wildflowers, and 550
species of birds. After 150 years of settlement, the native Texas landscape and
environment, as we know it, may not survive this generation. 

<P>

The 1990's are witnessing one of humankind's greatest challenges to balance
opportunities for development with the constraints of our planet's natural
resources. Collectively as a species, we must adopt measures which will ensure
responsible change. We must utilize our creativity and ingenuity to develop
preventative, pro-active policies, initiate programs and harness resources to
accomplish sustainability. Sustainable development balances our needs
for growth with limitations to natural resources, now and in the future.

<P>
<HR>
<IMG SRC="images/water.gif" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="Water" WIDTH=58 HEIGHT=56>

<H2>Water Quality</H2>


Toxics, raw sewage, industrial waste, and run-off pollution continue to damage 
Texas waterways. Though the most blatant forms of pollution have been greatly
reduced since the Clean Water Act of 1972, untold damage to Texas rivers still
results in loss of wildlife species, impaired functioning of ecosystems
and increasingly perilous human health threats.

<P>

River pollution, particularly run-off, is generated by all of us and its solution
requires active citizen participation. Federal, state and local governments are
frequently unable to tackle these water quality problems because their resources
for water quality monitoring are severely limited. Reliable monitoring provides
an essential understanding of the nature and extent of river problems and
provides data which is integral to improving and protecting our state's
waterways.

<H2>Air Quality</H2>
Air pollution - often indiscernably present in our surroundings, in our lungs - silently destroys 
the environment and our health. The burning of fossil fuels in our cars and industries and the emmission of toxic 
chemicals in manufacturing processes accounts for most of the pollution released into our air: carbon 
monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfer dioxide, benzene, ash, smoke, and soot. Smog and acid rain are the visible 
results of these poisons comingling in our atmosphere.

<P>

But with proper monitoring and regulation we can limit pollutants and their devastating effects. For example, 
the phase-out of leaded gasoline in the 1980s resulted in a 90% decrease in lead emissions in the U.S.

<H2>Texas Lands & Wildlife</H2>

Texas is resplendent in its ecological diversity. State boundaries encompass piney wood forests, prairies, 
coastal marshes, savannas, canyonlands, wetlands, deserts, and mountain ranges.

<P>

Texas' biodiversity is threatened by continuing, uncontrolled and unsustainable development. Urbanization, 
agricultural pesticides, timber production, hazardous wastes dumped onto the land and pumped into the ground, 
have irreplacably altered the natural Texas landscape. Widespread habitat loss and species extinction will 
continue without responsible urban planning and development, designations of critical habitats 
and endangered species, and the mitigation of agricultural and industrial activities that poison and erode the soil.

<P>
The Texas Environmental Center has received matching funds from The National Environmental Education and Training Foundation in Washington. D.C. to manage an Internet site in tandem with the Project.  This will allow us to publicize the Project, extend our content to the classroom, and keep the information we provide about the Springs current. 
<P>
Undertaking such a project is a lengthy task.  TEC's director, Marshall Frech, began 3 years of  interviews and historical  research on Barton Springs in 1991 which formed the basis for the book Barton Springs Eternal.  This research included talking to old-timers, scientists, artists, policy-makers and others.  Today, the Texas Environmental Center (TEC) works as a team continually gathering photographs, film footage, interviews and research from such organizations as:

Right Now
<P>
The Barton Springs Multimedia Project is constantly evolving. . . In addition to this site, TEC has a functional, interactive prototype available for demonstration.  Upcoming issues of GreenBeat! magazine will feature stories and images from this Project.
<P>
Upon Completion
<P>
This project will manifest as both a kiosk inside the new educational center that the City is building at the Springs and a CD-ROM. The kiosk which houses this project at the Barton Springs Educational Center will have a direct connection to the Internet.  Anyone using this kiosk will be able to follow their interests onto the world's resources on the topic.  Relevant resources will be linked to topics inside the project's content.

Those limestone rocks around him are called "karst."  Because karst is very porous, it makes a good filter for water that trickles down from above ground.</TD></TR>

The Texas Environmental Center (TEC) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization extending environmental education through information technology. TEC has been a pioneer in the use of the Internet since1991 when we joined in a partnership with Rice University to develop one of the first electronic environmental libraries in the nation.  TEC currently manages several Internet projects and runs an advanced bulletin board system for environmental education programs.

<A HREF="../greenbeat/index.html">GreenBeat! Magazine</A>--a monthly Internet magazine of environmental leadership. GreenBeat! profiles student and professional environmental endeavors directly supplemented by scientific facts, paths to involvement and career opportunities. Each month features a different environmental topic, adding to a dynamic and growing archive of online environmental information.
<P>
<A HREF="../almanac/index.html">Texas Environmental Almanac Online</A>--a first-of-its-kind research compendium of Texas environmental information produced by the Texas Center for Policy Studies and electronically published by TEC.   The Almanac provides an extremely comprehensive portrait of our states environment health through the distillation of public environmental research and Texas state agencies' environmental data.  This is an excellent resource for students writing research papers.
<P>
<A HREF="../tec/tec.html">TEC Online Environmental Resources Listings</A>--information about  Texas water, air, land and wildlife including the Encyclopedia of Water Terms, photo documentaries, Texas maps, public notices,  links to other Texas environmental information on the Internet and reviews of outstanding online resource collections.
Additionally, TEC manages an electronic bulletin board system for use by public and private schools in Central Texas participating in collaborative environmental education programs sponsored by the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA).

considered major contributors to the destruction of the Earth's ozone layer. HCFC
is, 1/20th as potent as CFC in its ozone-destroying capacity. Any amount of
additional threat to the ozone layer can be dangerous, due to the long term
potency of CFCs. The current ozone damage is generally attributed to CFCs
released 10 to 15 years ago. Twenty percent of ozone damage is caused by CRCs in

advantage to minimize the need for artificial lighting during the day. For
example: a clerestory is a daylighting strategy that allows natural light into a
building interior through a raised section of roof with vertical glass. Shading
of the glass allows light in while minimizing heat gain. Louvers on the exterior
of vertical glass on a house can reflect natural light into the interior without

DISCHARGE: In the simplest form, discharge means outflow of water. The use of
this term is not restricted as to course or location and it can be applied to
describe the flow of water from a pipe or from a drainage basin. If the discharge
occurs in a course or channel, it is correct to speak of the discharge of a canal
or of a river. It is also correct to speak of the discharge of a canal or stream
into a lake, stream or ocean. Discharge is a comprehensive outflow term. Other

steam condensed back into a liquid that is almost pure water. The impurities
(minerals) remain in the concentrated residue.<p>

DISTRIBUTION OF WATER: The management of water which allows water users to
receive the amount of water to which they are entitled by law and as supply
permits.<p>

WATER WHEEL: A device such as an turbine or similar engine to transform the
energy of flowing water into mechanical power.<p>

WATER WITCH: A person who predicts the presence of underground water with
hand-held tools such as forked twigs or metal rods. The United States Geological
Survey and the National Water Well Association do not advise against using a
water witch to search for ground water, but say that there is no scientific basis
for the belief in water witchery.<p>

WATER YEAR: The 12-month period, usually October 1 through September 30. The

The Lower Colorado River Authority is a multi-purpose public agency created by
the Texas Legislature in 1934 to improve the quality of life in the Central Texas
area.  It receives no state tax money and cannot levy taxes.  It operates on
revenues from the wholesale electric and water sales and other services.<P> The
LCRA supplies electricity to more than 800,000 Texans through 44 wholesale
customers, including 11 electric cooperatives and 33 cities.  It also serves
numerous water customers, including cities, the rice-growing industry and
municipal utility districts.<P>

The LCRA also provides many other services to the region, including managing
floods, protecting the quality of the lower Colorado and its tributaries,
providing parks and recreation facilities, offering economic development
assistance, helping water and wastewater utilities, and providing soil, energy
and water conservation programs.<P>


<H3><A NAME="meetlcra">MEET THE LCRA STAFF</A></H3>

<UL> <li>Mary Ann Neely (473-3261)  Mary Anne Neely is the Project Manager for
the Colorado River Watch Network.  She has been with LCRA since the spring of
1993.  Her job is to be an intermediary between LCRA upper managment and River
Watch staff and volunteers and to do a lot of the administrative work associated
with running a program as massive as this one.  She also helps to organize the
workshops and symposiums and loves it when they're at Lake Buchanan so she can
eat all that wonderful food and take midnight hikes along the dam!  Mary Ann is
also a veteran of Austin's political and environmental communities.  She has
managed election campaigns for more than one successful local politician and has
been Texas Director of Clean Water Action, a national fundraising organization.

<li>Jill Parrish (473-3333 ext. 2403)  Jill is our own very special Volunteer
Coordinator and Data Manager and she began working with the River Watch in the
spring of 1994.  She worked for LCRA for about a year before that in the water
lab, and has become a wet lab whiz.  She shares the work that Jack does--site
visits,  talking with the volunteers, running workshops, and keeping everyone
happy as well as the data management.  And she's really tired of jokes about Jack
and Jill fetching pails of water!  Jill has been a monitor and a trainer in the
River Watch since 1992.

<li>Mary Gilroy (473-3333, ext. 7634)

<li>Cindy Linz (473-3333, ext. 2416)  Cindy has been the intern for the CRWN 
since August 1993.  Her job is to enter data, plan the student symposium, put
together the LaMotte kits, and give anyone else who needs it a helping hand.  She
also monitors a site on Lake Austin just down from the LCRA building.  Cindy will
be a junior this fall at ACC and hopes to transfer to another school to get her
degree in Environmental Science.   She loves to garden, translate Russian, meet 
people, hike, do arts and crafts, and listen to folk music.  Her vision for the
RIver Watch is for it to bring people together up and down the watershed and to
make the River clean.  Her favorite part about working in the River Watch is
meeting people and learning things about the river she never knew.<P> </UL>

<P>

<P>A bioregion classifies an area based primarily on the common characteristics of
climate, soil, landforms, microclimates, plant communities, watersheds, and
native plants and animals.  Several individuals and groups have described various
bioregions that make up the State of Texas.  The following descriptions of Texas
bioregions is based on the bioregional delineations developed by the Natural
Heritage Policy Project at a conference in Winedale, Texas, in 1978.  The result
of this meeting was a description of eleven natural regions and 27 subregions.

<HR><B>Region 1 - Piney Woods</B>

<P>Composed of two subregions, the Longleaf Pine Forest and the Mixed Pine-Oak
Forest, this portion of the state can best be described as gently rolling to
hilly-forested land.  The forested areas give way at times to small, open
grasslands.  The region has an average rainfall of 35 to 50 inches and vegetation
is abundant. Farming, cattle ranching, and lumbering have been major economic
activities and continue to be of considerable importance.  Human population
growth, in particular the northward expansion of Houston, is having major
ecological impacts on the region.  This region occupies the eastern extreme of
the state and covers approximately 23,500 square miles.

<HR><B>Region 2 - Oak Woods and Prairies</B>

<P>Running generally from northeast to southwest, is the 19,500 square mile band of
Oak Woods and Prairies.  Region Two is gently rolling to hilly and receives 35 to
45 inches of rainfall per year.  While the rainfall in the Piney Woods Region is
fairly uniformly distributed throughout the year, the rainfall in Region Two
peaks in May or June.  The Oak Woods and Prairies Region contains three
subregions:  the Western Cross Timbers, Oak Woodlands, and Eastern Cross Timbers.
Cattle raising has been a major economic pursuit in the region and has taken a
toll on the native grasslands.  There are several river valleys that cross the
region.  These valleys are often forested with an abundance of hackberries,
pecans, and oaks.

<HR><B>Region 3 - Blackland Prairies</B>

<P>This region takes in approximately 25,500 square miles.  The Blackland Prairies
once consisted of 12,000,000 acres of tallgrass prairies but due to crops and
grazing, today there is less than 5,000 acres left.  The region has two
subregions, the Blackland Prairies and the Grand Prairies.  The major difference
between the two is that the Grand Prairie has shallower soils and does not
develop the tallgrass communities as the Blackland Prairie does.

<HR><B>Region 4 - Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes</B>

<P>South of the Blackland Prairies and Piney Woods is Region Four, the Gulf Coast
Prairies and Marshes.  This region is around 21,000 square miles and is made up
of three subregions:  Dunes and Barrier Islands, Estuarine Zone, and the Upland
Prairies and Woods.  The region is generally level with an abundance of streams
and rivers flowing into the Gulf of Mexico.  To be such an ecologically valuable
area, with its numerous estuaries, bays and marshes, it has been assaulted with a
variety of human impacts.  Urban growth, industrial expansion with its resulting
pollution, fragmentation of the landscape, and agricultural development have all
added to the heavy burden on the region's ecosystems. 

<HR><B>Region 5 - Coastal Sand Plains</B>

<P>The Coastal Sand Plains is an area of mainly grasslands, extensive clusters of
oaks or oak mottes, and salt marshes.  The land is fairly level and the soil
contains much windblown sand.  As isolated as this portion of the state is, there
has been significant impact from extensive cattle grazing.  During the 19th
Century, the area was noted for large herds of feral horses.  For a time, the
region was called Wild Horse Prairie. 

<HR><B>Region 6 - South Texas Brush Country</B>

<P>Most of the southern tip of the state is a region called the South Texas Brush
Country.  It takes in around 28,000 square miles and is divided into three
subregions:  the Subtropical Zone, Brush Country, and the Bordas Escarpment. 
This area, as its name implies, is a region with an abundance of brush.  The area
had extensive grasslands in the past, but continued grazing, among other factors,
altered the vegetation.  The Brush Country supports an abundance of wildlife. 

<HR><B>Region 7 - Edwards Plateau</B>

<P>The Edwards Plateau is also known as the "Hill Country".  On its eastern and
southeastern boundaries, there is a fairly obvious change from the Blackland
Prairies to the limestone canyons and hills that make up a major portion of the
Plateau.  The area is also noted for its beautiful and mostly clear running
creeks and rivers.  This region is under severe pressure from a growing human
population and the development that comes with it.  The pressure is most severe
in the eastern and southeastern portions of the Plateau, with the expansion of
two large metropolitan areas, Austin and San Antonio. Urban sprawl is taking its
toll on many unique natural features.  In many areas, water is a major issue as
one of the aquifer systems is the primary water source for San Antonio and
numerous other communities, rural residents, and farmers. Excessive pumping,
pollution, and allowing building over the recharge portion of the aquifer
seriously harm this important source of water, not to mention all of the natural
biotic communities that rely on it. 

<HR><B>Region 8 - Llano Uplift</B>

<P>Second to the smallest region, the Llano Uplift comprises around 5,000 square
miles.  This is a very unusual region made up of numerous hills of granite.  The
soils are very sandy and help support the extensive grasslands, Oak-Hickory
woodlands, and mesquite savannah.  The area is mainly used for ranching but is
also noted for producing fine granites for building and other uses.  A very
beautiful and unusual feature of the region is the granite hill complex making up
Enchanted Rock State Natural Area.


<HR><B>Region 9 - Rolling Plains</B>

<P>The Rolling Plains is the largest of the regions, encompassing 43,500 square
miles.  It includes three subregions:  the Mesquite Plains, Escarpment Breaks,
and the Canadian Breaks.  This region, together with the High Plains Region, is
the southern end of the Great Plains of the Central United States.  The Canadian,
the Colorado, the Red, and the Concho Rivers begin in the western portions of the
Rolling Plains and the breaks of the Cap Rock Escarpment.  Excessive grazing and
other improper agricultural practices have caused considerable damage to this
region. 

<HR><B>Region 10 - High Plains</B>

<P>The High Plains is mostly a level, high plateau.  This region is separated from
the Rolling Plains to the east by the Caprock Escarpment.  The area is also noted
for extended droughts and a fairly low average annual rainfall.  Poor
agricultural practices and overgrazing have taken their toll on this region as
well. 

<HR><B>Region 11 - Trans Pecos</B>

<P>In the western-most part of the state, the Trans Pecos region is noted for its
mountain ranges, plateaus, desert valleys, and extensive savannahs.  The main
representation of the Chihuahuan Desert in the United States is found in the
Trans Pecos region.  Oak-Juniper woodlands occur in the various mountain ranges.
This is the second largest region, encompassing around 38,000 square miles.
Several large National and State Parks and State Natural Areas are in the region,
including Big Bend and Guadalupe Mountains National Parks, Big Bend Ranch State
Natural Area, and the Davis Mountains State Park.

<A NAME="MANAGEMENT">Management</A> of water resources in Texas is a complex task. Consider just a few factors: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Geographical variations cause large disparities in available water supplies, from water shortages in arid West Texas to abundant supplies in the eastern portion of the state. 
<P>
<LI>A growing population and industrial base will continue to increase pressure on existing supplies and generate demand for development of additional water delivery facilities such as reservoirs. 
<P>
<LI>Reliance on groundwater is facing serious limitations in many areas of the state due to overpumping and water quality problems. 
<P>
<LI>Even though all water forms part of the same hydrological cycle, the Texas institutional structure for managing water quantity and protecting water quality is divided among several state and local government agencies charged with implementing a convoluted set of statutes and court decisions.

<H4><A NAME="MUCH">HOW MUCH WATER IN TEXAS?</A></H4>
<P>
Texas receives about 366 million acre-feet of rain annually. In the period from 1940 to 1970, surface runoff varied from 23 to 57 million acre-feet per year. Average annual flow is about 49 million acre-feet.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#1">(1)</A> Levels of precipitation and run-off vary greatly across the state. In the eastern portion, precipitation averages 56 inches per year; in West Texas, annual rainfall is only about eight inches.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#2">(2)</A> This rainfall feeds 191,228 miles of streams and rivers contained in 15 major river basins and eight coastal basins, 5,700 inland reservoirs which comprise over 3 million square acres, nearly a million square miles of bays, almost 8 million acres of wetlands and vast underground storage areas known as aquifers.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#3">(3)</A> 
<P>
Texas has only one natural lake - Caddo Lake in East Texas. The other 5,700 lakes have been constructed by humans.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#4">(4)</A> About 97 percent of the surface water consumed by Texas is drawn from 191 reservoirs that each hold more than 5,000 acre-feet of water.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#5">(5)</A> Approximately 11 million acre-feet of 
surface water are available for human use at Texas major reservoirs. At present, the state uses only about 65 percent of this dependable yield.
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="FYI.GIF">  One acre-foot is equal to 325,851 gallons - an area about the size of a football field covered with one foot of water.<P>
	<CITE>Texas Water Development Board, Texas Water Facts, <A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#4">(4) </A></CITE>.
</UL>
<P>
Texas also has an estimated 3 to 4 billion acre-feet of groundwater stored in nine major aquifers and 20 minor aquifers, underground natural rock formations which hold groundwater. However, only about 10 percent of this groundwater is recoverable using traditional technology.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#6">(6)</A> 
<P>
In addition to these available groundwaters, each year about 5.3 million acre-feet of annual rainfall recharges the state's aquifers. In 1990, the 8.9 million acre-feet of water pumped from underground exceeded natural recharge - the downward replenishing flow of rainfall through the soil to the aquifer.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#7">(7)</A> The Texas Water Development Board projects that by 2040, the state will decrease its groundwater use to about 5.7 million acre-feet of groundwater.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#8">(8)</A>
<H4>
<A NAME="USES">WHO USES THE WATER?</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texans pump, push, pull, consume and discharge water for all kinds of uses. Statewide, demands for water totaled about 15.8 million acre-feet in 1990, with groundwater use equaling about 56 percent of total use.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#9">(9)</A> Water use in Texas can be divided into six major categories. Irrigation, municipal use 
and manufacturing together accounted for nearly 95 percent of all water consumed in 1990. Steam-electric-power generation, livestock watering and mining together accounted for 5 percent of consumption in 1990.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#10">(10)</A><P>

<A NAME="OWNER">WATER OWNERSHIP IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Despite their interrelatedness in the hydrological cycle, groundwater and surface water are treated differently in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#11">(11)</A>Surface water bodies are the property of the state but the right to use surface water for specific purposes such as irrigation or mining is a private property right. Today, these "water rights" are regulated by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. Groundwater is privately owned: it belongs to the owner of the land above it and the owners may pump all the water they can from beneath their land regardless of the impact to nearby landowners.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#12">(12)</A>

</CENTER><P>
<H4>
<A NAME="18TH">EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH CENTURY WATER LAW</A>
</H4>
<P>
The history of water regulation in Texas began with the Spanish settlers in Texas. Spanish water law required specific authorization to use water. The Spanish (and later Mexican) type of water law evolved into the "prior appropriation" doctrine which holds that water "rights" are separate and apart from the rights of land ownership, much like oil and mineral rights are today separate from land ownership.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#13">(13)</A> However, in the 1800s Anglo-American settlers in Texas introduced English common law for claiming the use of water. This water law establishes the right of use based upon ownership of land. The owner of land adjacent to a river had the right to fish that river or divert water for irrigation, or otherwise make use of it. These property-based water rights are legally referred to as "riparian" rights, after a Latin word that means pertaining to the bank or shore of a river or lake. Groundwater was likewise attached to the property above it; landowners were free to pump whatever they could from wells dug on their property.

<H5>Texas Environmental Almanac, Chapter 2, Water 
Quality, Page 1
</H5>
<H4>
<A NAME="Introduction">INTRODUCTION</A>
</H4>
<P>
The competing demands made on water have affected not only its supply and future availability, but also its quality. In some watersheds, diversion and damming of rivers has reduced streamflow, which has concentrated pollutants in a smaller volume of water and thereby degraded overall surface water quality. Some Texas rivers are prevented from drying up entirely only by the return flow of wastewater, which, even when optimally treated, is of lower quality than the river's original water. 
<P>
Groundwater quality has likewise suffered the effects of high demand. Continual mining of aquifers has lowered the quality of groundwater by drawing up the salt water that lies deep in most aquifers into the formations from which water for human consumption is drawn. 
<P>
Mitigating the effects of high demand on both surface water and groundwater quality will require a long-term commitment to conservation and limits on development. Representing a more acute risk to water quality, though, is contamination that results from such human activities as industry, agriculture and urban life. Water moves in a continuous hydrological cycle from earth to atmosphere and back. This means that all bodies of water - rivers, lakes, oceans and aquifers - are essentially connected to each other, allowing for many sources of contamination. 
<P>
In Texas, human activity has affected water quality in all 15 river basins, in the eight coastal basins where rivers drain into the Gulf of Mexico and in all major aquifers, including some that are sources of drinking water. This section examines four aspects of water quality:

Drinking Water Quality, and<P>

Water Quality in Coastal Areas.
</OL></B><P>
<H4>
<A NAME="HISTORY">HISTORY</A> OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION
</H4>
<P>
For more than 100 years, the federal government has been passing laws to provide funding and oversight for the development of dams, reservoirs and canals. Not until the 1940s and 1950s, however, did Congress begin to address water pollution legislatively. And initial efforts in this area, like the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948, did not address pollution prevention plans or the development of water quality standards. Instead they focused on funding water treatment plants, identifying polluted bodies of water and locating the polluters for legal action. Unfortunately, the strategy of determining which polluter caused which pollution was expensive and often unsuccessful.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#1">(1)</A>

<P>
Comprehensive legislation to protect water quality didn't take off until the 1960s. Rachel Carson's 1962 bestseller, <B>Silent Spring</B>, bolstered by articles and scientific reports detailing pollution problems, provided the impetus for the nation's first water quality legislation.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#2">(2)</A> During the early 1960s, the National Wildlife Federation, the Izaak Walton League and the National Audubon Society campaigned for strong federal water-quality bills. 
<P>
One result was the 1965 Water Quality Act, which established within the Department of Interior the Water Pollution Control Administration. With the creation of this new federal agency, water quality was for the first time treated as an environmental concern, apart from the more traditional public health concern. The new agency also had precedence over states in setting water quality standards. The 1965 law was soon followed by the 1966 Clean Waters Act, which provided construction grants for wastewater treatment facilities. 
<P>
The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, administered by the Department of the Interior, attempted to preserve waters with outstanding scenic, recreational or habitat value by placing them on a Secretary of Interior-approved list. To a limited degree, the law protects these listed "wild and scenic rivers" from water projects and from additional discharges. It prohibits the development of public or private hydroelectric power plants on these rivers and restrains certain other types of development. In Texas, only the Rio Grande has been designated as a wild and scenic river, and this designation has not protected the river from degradation. In fact, in 1993, American Rivers, a non-profit watchdog organization, named the Rio Grande the most endangered river in the U.S.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#3">(3)</A>
 
<P>
The Clean Water Act of 1972 forms the basis today for water quality protection for surface water in streams, rivers and lakes as well as for groundwater. It was enacted as a series of amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948, a law spurred by public concern over epidemics of disease caused by water-borne bacteria. The 1972 Act was prompted by the worsening condition of U.S. rivers and by several high-profile oil spills, including the Santa Barbara channel spill, in which 250 million gallons of crude oil escaped to damage miles of California coastline.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#4">(4)</A>
 
<P>
The Clean Water Act required both municipal and industrial polluters to employ approved technologies in their operations. It also set water quality standards for major rivers and lakes and required discharge permits for both public and private facilities. The Act was strengthened in 1977 in an effort to address the most visible causes of water pollution. It explicitly prohibited the discharge of hazardous substances into waterways , including industrial waste, sewage, accidental spills, toxics and other point sources. The Clean Water Act of 1977 also further protected wetlands by requiring U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to issue permits for all dredging and filling projects. These permits are called <BR>
"404" permits.
<P>
Between 1972, when the first Clean Water Act was passed, and 1990, about $260 billion in private and public funds were spent on wastewater treatment facilities. Another $20 billion was spent to comply with federal requirements on drinking water quality, most of it from the public sector.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#5">(5)</A>

<P>
The 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act were the first concerted effort by the federal government to address pollution from non-point sources, including agricultural fields and feedlots, urban streets and run-off channeled through municipal stormwater systems. The law required states to develop a non-point-source management plan. As of 1990, the Environmental Protection Agency had approved these plans for 44 states, including Texas. <A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#6">(6)</A> While the goal of these plans is to alleviate non-point-source pollution, states are not required to go beyond voluntary programs. The management plans develop abatement strategies for water degraded by non-point sources, but implementation of the plans is strictly voluntary. The 1987 Act also created and funded several special programs, including one to deal with toxic hot spots and one to protect estuaries. 
<P>
In 1995, the U.S. Congress debated making major changes in the scope of the Clean Water Act, giving industries and cities much greater 
flexibility in meeting clean water standards. Texas and national environmental groups opposed these changes.
<P>
Early in the twentieth century, contamination of the water supply and outbreaks of disease led to questions about how we purify our water and how we protect our drinking water supplies from pollution. The Public Health Service Act of 1912 set guidelines for allowable levels of contaminants related to communicable diseases like typhoid. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 created national drinking water standards to limit a range of substances that can adversely affect human health. These maximum-contaminant levels set by the Environmental Protection Agency are based upon the health effects of a single contaminant. They do not consider the cumulative impact of a combination of contaminants on human health, because little is known about possible synergistic effects. Thus, the protective value of these standards may fall short of what is optimum for human health.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#11">(11)</A>
 
<P>
The 1986 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act accelerated the EPA's schedule for bringing contaminants under regulation and expanded the number of contaminants covered. It also banned all future use of lead pipes and lead solder in public drinking water systems, increased fines and enforcement and mandated greater protection of drinking water obtained from groundwater through the establishment of a well-head protection program.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#12">(12)</A>

<P>
Though these laws have enhanced the safety of the public water supply, they have been a major expense for public water systems, especially systems serving smaller populations. In 1993, for example, at the direction of the 1986 Drinking Water Act, EPA increased from six to 18 the number of regulated pesticides. EPA estimated that it would cost $24 billion per year for 200,000 systems across the country to monitor the regulated contaminants. Monitoring for 30 to 35 as-yet-unregulated contaminants in anticipation of future regulations would cost these public water systems an additional $89 billion.<A HREF="NOTES2.HTML#13">(13)</A>
 
<P>
Other federal environmental laws related to water quality include: 
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 - Required an Environmental Impact Statement for federally-funded projects. 
	<P>
	<LI>Endangered Species Act of 1973 and 1988 - Protects animal and plant species, including those living in aquatic environments, that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has designated as threatened or endangered.
	<P>
	<LI>Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 and Superfund Authorization and Renewal Act of 1984 - Regulated management of solid waste and underground storage tanks, both of which may leak into groundwater. 
	<P>
	<LI>Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 - Created a $1.6 billion Superfund to clean up abandoned hazardous waste sites, including those contaminating groundwater, and required major industries to report annual releases of toxic waste onto the air, water or land.
	<P>
	<LI>Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act of 1972 - Required registration and regulation of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals which can contaminate both surface water and groundwater.

<tr><th>TESTING WATER WITH OUR HEADS IN THE SAND?
</th><tr><td>
In 1992 and again in 1994, the river authorities for all 15 inland rivers and eight coastal basins where the rivers flow into the Gulf of Mexico identified the lack of water-quality monitoring as the single biggest pollution issue facing their river basins.<A HREF="notes2.html#7">(7)</A> 
In 1994, under the administration of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and as required by the federal Clean Water Act, the state tested water quality at 695 sites in 1,700 different samples. This level of monitoring represents an increase over the 1991 to 1993 period, but is substantially less than during the 1980s, when most sites were sampled at least quarterly, rather than annually.<A HREF="notes2.html#8">(8)</A> However, these sites included only about one in three of the miles of continually flowing, or "perennial," streams and rivers. Thus, almost nothing is known about the quality of 25,000 out of 40,000 miles of the state's permanent rivers and streams. Also unexamined is the water quality in some 145,000 miles of "intermittent" streams, which flow only during periods of high rainfall.
<p>
In 1994, the Commission monitored water quality in only 114 of an estimated 5,700 lakes and reservoirs.<A HREF="notes2.html#9">(9)</A> Though these reservoirs contain more than 50 percent of total acres in the state's lakes and reservoirs, the sampling protocol nevertheless leaves almost 5,600 smaller bodies of water virtually unmonitored, including 90 reservoirs with more than 5,000 acre-feet of water.<A HREF="notes2.html#10">(10)</A> And where the state does monitor water quality, little testing is done to detect the presence of toxic chemicals or to evaluate the overall state of aquatic life. 
<p>
Instead, the Commission concentrates its limited resources for monitoring on physiochemical parameters such as dissolved oxygen content, pH, streamflow, temperature, fecal coliform levels, total dissolved solids, sulfate and chloride. Heavy metals and organics, including some toxics, are also tested in the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission's laboratory.<A HREF="notes2.html#14">(14)</A> 
<p>
Even less information is available on the quality of groundwater because the state has no systematic monitoring program for its aquifers. Limited monitoring is done around certain potential contamination sources, such as hazardous waste sites and uranium mines. Otherwise, periodic studies of water wells by the Texas Water Development Board, the Texas Department of Agriculture and some local groundwater conservation districts are the only source of information on groundwater quality. And the Texas Water Development Board is only able to inventory about 10 percent of the nearly 12,000 water wells drilled each year to assign them a state well number and put them on a topographic map. Since this inventory forms the basis for monitoring water quality and for assuring that abandoned wells are properly plugged, gaps in information are significant. In fact, in the absence of state oversight, local and regional governments have been assigning these wells their own numbers.<A HREF="notes2.html#15">(15)</A>

<A NAME="ORIGINS">THE ORIGINS OF UNITED STATES PARKLAND</A>
</H4>
<P>
In the United States by the mid 1800s the impact of the exploitation of nature by a growing population had sent up cries of alarm. The documented decline of distinct bird and other wildlife species forced the creation of hunting regulations. The dramatic loss of forests in the Midwest and redwood clearings in California became a call to action. In 1864, a group of California citizens pressed Congress to grant Yosemite Valley to the State of California, which would act as a trustee for the federal government. Thus began the national park movement in the United States. The next park to be created by Congress was Yellowstone in 1872. Because no state existed in that region, it was put directly under federal protection.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#1">(1)</A> Naturalists of the 19th century recognized that entire bio-regions in North America were being devastated, and patches of parkland could not make up for that loss. But in the face of a laissez-faire economy, in which natural resources were regarded as commodities to be used, an effort was made to protect only a few of these ecosystems through public ownership. 
<P>
Even though naturalist writers such as John Muir had helped create support for public ownership of these lands, nineteenth century Congressional leaders were reluctant to designate national parks. According to conservation historian John Petulla, the railroad companies, who wanted to bring train travelers through scenic territory, were the most influential lobbying force for the national park movement. Even so, at that time Congress would not establish a national park unless it was demonstrated that the area could not be exploited for commercial purposes.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#2">(2)</A>

<H4><A NAME="PUBLIC">PUBLIC LANDS IN TEXAS</A></H4>

<P>
Nineteenth century political leaders in Texas sold off state lands as rapidly as possible to encourage settlement and economic development. By the turn of the century, most of the state's 266,807 square miles were privately owned.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#3">(3)</A> 
<UL>
<LI>Of the 172 million dry acres (excludes submerged coastal lands) in Texas, 4.5 million acres, or 2.6 percent of Texas land, was in the public domain in 1994. Today, two state parks - the Big Bend Ranch State Natural Area and Devil's River State Park area account for 23 percent of state parkland.
</UL>
<P>
The 1991-1992 Green Index ranked Texas 37th in the nation with 0.20 percent of its budget spent for parks.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#4">(4)</A> The National Association of State Park Directors ranked Texas 28th with 0.3 percent of state land area in parkland. 
<P>
Significant Parkland Legislation in Texas
<P>
<UL>
<LI> In 1923, the Texas State Parks Board was created to accept donated parkland.

<LI> In 1930, the Park Board received its first appropriations to acquire parkland. Those first purchases of Texas state parkland included Palo Duro Canyon, Longhorn Cavern and Big Bend State Park (now the Big Bend National Park).
<LI> In 1963, the State Parks Board and the Game and Fish Commission were merged to form the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department(TPWD). 
</UL>
<P>
State Parks: Large areas of outstanding natural or scenic value; allowable uses include camping, hiking, picnicking and public hunting if designated by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. 
<P>
State Recreational Areas: Areas of natural or scenic character, selectively developed to provide resource-oriented recreational opportunities.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#5">(5)</A> 
<P>
State Natural Areas: Areas established for the protection and stewardship of outstanding features of statewide significance, which may be used in a sustainable manner for scientific research, education, aesthetic enjoyment, and appropriate public use as sound biological management permits.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#6">(6)</A> 
<P>
Historical Areas: Areas established for the preservation, and interpretation of prehistoric and historic resources of statewide or national significance. Historic areas shall provide for resource oriented recreation or public uses that are not detrimental to the long term preservation of the cultural and natural resources.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#7">(7)</A>
<P>
State Wildlife Management Areas (WMA): Areas primarily devoted to preservation of the state's wildlife resources. WMA are acquired for multiple uses, however, including demonstration areas for wildlife management, public hunting and fishing and other outdoor recreational activities. 
<P>
State and Federal Forests: Federal and state forests are set aside for multiple uses, including timber harvesting, mining, cattle-raising and wildlife habitat and recreational activities.
<P>
Federal Wilderness Areas: Lands designated for special protection by the U.S. Congress. They must meet certain minimum size requirements and can be used for wildlife protection, recreational, conservation, scenic or scientific purposes.
<P>
Federal Wildlife Refuges: Areas intended for protection of wildlife and their habitat. They are usually open to the public for bird watching and wildlife viewing. 
<P>
Federal Grasslands: Approximately 38,000 acres of national grasslands are located in Montague, Wise and Fannin Counties. These grasslands are set aside for multiple purposes, including recreational opportunities, forage for grazing and oil or gas production.
<P>
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) was appropriated $139.2 million by the Texas Legislature for fiscal year 1994. Over 70 percent of these appropriated funds are directly generated by users through licenses, park fees and magazine subscriptions and indirectly through excise taxes on hunting and fishing equipment that return to the Department through federal aid programs.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#8">(8)</A> 
<P>
State and federal funding going to the department for parks has been on the decline over the last fifteen years. Undedicated general tax revenues, which had been used to subsidize park operations, dropped from $30 million per biennium several years ago to $0 for the 94-95 biennium.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#9">(9)</A> State and local parks also have been supported by a state cigarette tax - 2 cents per pack sold - and federal revenues from oil and gas royalties from the outer continental shelf. Because fewer people are smoking, there has been a decline in cigarette taxes. There has also been a major decline in revenues from oil and gas royalties. In light of this, the TPWD asked the Legislature to replace the cigarette tax as a source of revenue with sporting goods sales taxes. This new tax went into effect in September 1994 . But this "swap" does not provide the Department with any more revenue during the 1994-95 biennium. The sporting goods sales taxes dedicated to the agency are limited to the amount the agency would have normally received in cigarette taxes ($26 million annually).<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#10">(10)</A>  In 1996 the appropriation, however, will be raised to $32 million. 
<P>
In 1987, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department spent $34,499,890 to maintain, administer and improve the Texas park system. In 1993, TPWD spent $36,092,717 on these operating costs. An additional $10,289,218 was spent on fixed capital outlay; this included major repairs at parks and improvements on park facilities.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#11">(11)</A> Using these 1993 figures, per capita expenditures on the state park system is approximately $2.59.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#12">(12)</A>
<P>
According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, unfunded needs for the state park system during 1995-1999 will be approximately $456 million: $55 million unfunded repair needs, $45 million capital improvement unfunded needs, $82 million unmet development (park facilities) needs, $9 million unfunded conservation (erosion control, archaeological assessments, etc) needs and $265 million unfunded acquisition needs.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#13">(13)</A> 
<P>
The acquisition of parkland is decided by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's nine member commission on a case-by-case basis and is dependent, of course, on available funds.

<H4>PERCENTAGE OF THE STATE LAND AREA IN PARKS</H4>
Across the US, about one-half of the average state's land area is dedicated to state parks.  Texas is about one-half the national average.<p>
<IMG SRC="g.stateland.gif" BORDER=4 ALIGN=middle ALT="Graphic showing the percentage of state land area in parks">

Note: The discrepancy between the percentages in this graph and the "State Park Acreage" table is due to the varying definitions of state parks.

According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, as of September 1, 1993, there were 28.83 acres of state park system land (park, natural and historic areas) per thousand people. To maintain that relationship with current population growth, Texas must acquire 7,700 acres of parkland per year.<A HREF="NOTES3.HTML#14">(14)</A>

<A NAME="WILD">WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY</A>
</H4>

Judging by the attention that U.S. environmental protection laws are being given today, it would seem that the country's focus on wildlife protection has just begun. In fact, faced with diminished wildlife species due to unregulated hunting and to the "civilizing" of the frontier, the United States began legislatively protecting wildlife and habitats in the 19th century. For example, in 1894, Congress prohibited hunting in Yellowstone National Park. At the same time, the documentation of species loss resulted in the enactment of game laws at both the state and national levels. 
<P>
For the most part, the laws and regulations governing wildlife treat animals, birds and fish as harvestable resources, much like trees: you can only take so much at one time, leaving just enough to continue the reproduction process. 
<P>
The following acts have been significant in federal wildlife legislation:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>In 1900, the Lacy Act authorized activities to protect, preserve, and restore game and other wild birds. 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1903, the Pelican Island National Refuge was established as the first federally protected habitat.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#1">(1)</A>  
	<P>
	<LI>In 1916, the National Park Service Organic Act set up the national park system to provide public recreational areas and to conserve ecologically sensitive acreage.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#2">(2)</A>  
	<P>
	<LI>In 1918, the Migratory Bird Act prohibited the hunting of all migratory and insect-eating birds except as specifically allowed under federal regulations. 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1937, the Pittman-Robertson Act imposed excise taxes on hunting equipment, such as rifles, shotguns and ammunition, to support state wildlife conservation programs. 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1958, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act was established to identify adverse effects on wildlife of water resource development projects while those projects are in their proposal stage. The legislation is incorporated in the 404 section of the Clean Water Act.
	<P>
	<LI>In 1972, the Marine Mammal Protection Act banned the killing and importing of whales and nearly all other marine mammals. 
</UL>
<H4>
<A NAME="ENDANGERED">ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT</A>
</H4>
<P>
Many authorities believe the most far-reaching legislation protecting wildlife and habitat has been the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). Though more than 20 years old, this legislation remains controversial.
<P>
In enacting the Endangered Species Act, Congress addressed the question of why we should spend money to save non-human species. In the preamble to the ESA, Congress stated that "species of fish, wildlife and plants are of aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational and scientific value to the Nation and its people."<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#3">(3)</A> Scientists, conservationists and others concerned with the disappearance of wildlife have argued that all living things are part of a web in which each living creature plays a vital role: the loss of one can be detrimental to the whole. Moreover, conservationists and others agree that the smallest creature - even a slug - could benefit mankind by yielding scientific knowledge, even cures for diseases. They point out that it was a fungus that produced penicillin, the bark of the Yew tree holds a possible cure for some forms of cancer, and an Asian viper might contain a stroke prevention medicine. Plants and small creatures also benefit agriculture: farmers use insects, plants and other animals as alternatives to synthetic chemicals for pest and predator control. Aside from these utilitarian and anthropocentric reasons to preserve earth's species, many believe that every creature has intrinsic value and a right to live no matter what its relationship to humankind or its economic value.

<P>
The key elements of the Endangered Species Act are:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>Congress requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), an agency of the Interior Department, to devise a process for listing species that are endangered or threatened. 
	<P>
	<LI>USWFS must identify critical habitat of the species. Critical habitat is considered to be any ecosystem that, if altered or destroyed, would lead to species extinction or would hinder the recovery of a species. 
	<P>
	<LI>The Act also sets out requirements that prohibit "the taking, possession, transportation or sale of any species designated as threatened or endangered without a permit." "Take" under the Endangered Species Act includes killing, capturing, harming, and harassing. Harm includes modifying habitat to the point that the species' breeding, feeding, or sheltering is impaired.
	<P>
	<LI>Under the Endangered Species Act, any federal agency whose actions might affect an endangered species or its habitat must consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The federal agency must review its own actions to see if those actions might affect endangered species or its habitat. In the review process, the acting federal agency may ask for comments from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. For projects occurring in Texas, the acting federal agency can ask the Fish and Wildlife Service to review its proposed actions to see if those actions might affect endangered species or its habitat. 
	<P>
	<LI>Non-federal actions require approval of the Fish and Wildlife Service where there is a "take" of endangered species, provided such "taking" is incidental to and not the purpose of the activity. For example, if a private landowner wants to build a shopping center on land that has been determined to have an endangered species or its habitat, the landowner must get a permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#4">(4)</A> 
</UL>
<H4>
<A NAME="CRITICAL">CRITICAL HABITAT DESIGNATION</A>
</H4>
<P>
In addition to listing species as "endangered" or "threatened," the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can also designate critical habitats, that is, habitat necessary to recover the endangered species. "Critical habitat consists of those areas of land, water, and air space that an endangered or threatened species needs to survive and recover. Critical habitat may be one or more large geographic areas, or just a small area depending on the needs and distribution of the species."<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#5">(5)</A> There are a number of steps the Service must take before a critical habitat designation is made: 1) wildlife biologists identify the areas of importance to the species; 2) the Service analyzes the economic and other impacts of designating the area as a critical habitat; 3) the Service prepares a list of proposed areas and publishes it in the Federal Register and formally notifies federal, state and county governments and citizens seeking their comments; 4) after the public review period, the Service makes necessary changes; and, finally, 5) the Service officially designates the critical habitat.
<P>
Designating a critical habitat has two dominant impacts. Federal agencies must consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service if any of their activities affect the critical habitat, such as building a highway or reservoir. Because the Endangered Species Act prevents any federal action that adversely affects critical habitat, the activity contemplated might have to be altered. The same holds true for any activity or project that requires a federal permit or involves federal funding. The second impact is to make people aware that the area is important to the survival of an endangered species.
<P>
"Designation of critical habitat does not provide for federal government review of private land use, unless the landowner is planning a project that requires a federal permit or uses federal funds." <A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#6">(6)</A> However, the protection afforded the "taking" of an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act are not changed by the designation of critical habitat.
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> Though the permitting process has been available since 1982, the first permit was not issued in Texas until 1992. Because of population growth patterns and the location of endangered species and critical habitats in Central Texas, the USFWS located in Austin is the only Texas office that has furnished incidental-taking permits. It has not denied any request for incidental-taking permits, though all the permits require some form of mitigation activities. 
<P>
<I>Source: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Austin: June 1995.</I>
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> Relying on English common law, the federal Endangered Species Act has treated plant species as different from wildlife. Plants are considered to be a part of the real estate on which they grow, and thus they are legally treated as a part of private property. Animals, however, are part of the public trust and not owned by the property owner. 
</UL>
<P>
The Endangered Species Act has received its share of criticism from both environmentalists and landowners. Environmentalists claim that high profile species (what some call the "charismatic megafauna" or the "cuddly factor"), such as the bald eagle and grizzly bear, receive disproportionate funding for recovery while plants and invertebrates disappear. Some ESA detractors also suggest the Act is a crisis-based approach to species protection because it was designed to save species already on the verge of extinction, rather than foster a strategy that protects habitat. According to these critics, habitat or ecosystem management would provide a preventive approach to species protection. Meanwhile, others worry that the population of a species gets fundamentally reduced while the species waits to be listed as endangered. For example, the golden-cheeked warbler was identified as endangered in 1976 but was not listed by the Service until 1990. Others note that the Endangered Species Act has been more successful in recovery of species on public lands than on private lands. In the United States, 51 percent of endangered and threatened species are found on private lands. 
<P>
Some private landowners, who in Texas own approximately 97 percent of the land, argue that the Endangered Species Act has burdened them with the major responsibility of protecting endangered species without any compensation. These landowners claim that the Endangered Species Act lowers property values, and because of a cumbersome permit process, their ability to sell their property is hindered. Some private landowners further assert that the ESA is an assault on the Fifth Amendment private property right.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#7">(7)</A> Farmers and ranchers who oppose the ESA claim they have been the best stewards of the land and can manage it in an ecologically sound manner without federal guidance.
<P>
Regrettably, in Texas and elsewhere, the Endangered Species Act has become the target for special interest debate when in fact, it should be, as one adherent stated, "a common interest debate."<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#8">(8)</A> Both landowners and conservationists do seem to agree that species - not just endangered species - and habitat protection is important and cannot be achieved solely through government regulations. In Texas and across the country, states, municipalities, conservation groups, and landowners are proceeding to fashion new cooperative approaches and economic incentives for wildlife and habitat protection that address the concerns of both conservationists and landowners. Because 95 percent of the land in the United States (97 percent in Texas) is privately held, most approaches consider the interests of private landowners in preserving wildlife habitat. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department have programs that provide rural landowners with technical assistance on how to preserve wetlands and enhance other types of wildlife habitats. These ideas will be discussed later in this section.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#9">(9)</A>

<H4><A NAME="NATURAL">NATURAL SCIENCE 101</A>
</H4>
<P>
Soil is the material that is formed from rocks and decaying plants and animals; it makes up the outermost layer of the earth. There are at least 70,000 kinds of soil in the United States. Topsoil is considered the most productive soil layer. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, natural processes can take 500 years to form one inch of topsoil.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#1">(1)</A>

<H4><A NAME="CROPLAND">CROPLAND EROSION</A></H4>
Though concern for soil erosion in the United States dates back to the days of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, the federal government did not take action to address the problem until 1933. The dust storms of the 1930s, particularly in Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado and Kansas, resulted in tremendous crop and farm loss and thousands of unemployed farmers.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#2">(2)</A> This brought Presidential and Congressional attention to issues of soil erosion. 
<P>
One of the first steps Congress took was to create the Civilian Conservation Corps, which put unemployed men, including farmers, to work planting trees and building erosion control dams. In 1935, the Soil Conservation Service was established within the United States Department of Agriculture and began to work directly with farmers around the country creating soil and water conservation districts. Soil and Water Conservation Districts are political subdivisions of the state, governed by a board of directors elected by resident landowners of the district. Some of the soil erosion correctives recommended in the 1930s included crop rotation, contour plowing, planting tree rows and leaving marginal lands as pasture land. These practices were credited with arresting soil erosion for a time.  
<P>
Texas enacted its own Soil Conservation Laws in 1939, resulting in the establishment of the Texas Soil and Water Conservation Board. The Board coordinates the activities of the local soil and water conservation districts, which numbered 213 in 1994. 
<P>
In the 1970s, an increase in worldwide demand for farm commodities led the U.S. government to create new crop subsidy incentives to persuade farmers to plant "fencerow to fencerow." Farmers eager to increase production put marginal lands into production and discontinued the practice of crop rotation. To combat the depletion of overused soils, farmers had to increase their use of chemical fertilizers. By the mid 1980s, new federal action was needed to confront the problem of soil erosion. The current Food Security Act of 1985 (aka the 1985 Farm Bill) contains two major features, informally called the "sodbuster" programs, that address soil erosion. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) pays farmers to take highly erodible land out of production for 10 years. The Conservation Compliance Provision (CCP) requires farmers with highly erodible land to implement approved conservation plans by December 31, 1994, to be eligible for any federal farm program benefits.      
<P>
Large scale loss of soil from erosion results in at least two major environmental problems. First, cropland becomes less productive because the soil left after erosion loses its fertility and is unable to supply plants with necessary nutrients. The soil's ability to retain water is also greatly diminished. These changes, in turn, result in higher production costs, including the costs for the increased use of petrochemical-based fertilizers. Second, soil erosion by water causes sedimentation in waterways which threatens aquatic life and hinders the water flow. Soil erosion by water also carries polluting agricultural chemicals into rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs. According to a 1989 study conducted by the National Academy of Sciences, 350 to 400 million acres of agricultural land are estimated to account for more than 50 percent of suspended sediments deposited in surface waters in the United States.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#3">(3)</A>  
<P>
Experts recognize the difficulty in accurately assessing costs of soil erosion, but the USDA has estimated that the offsite costs to society of erosion in the United States are between $2 billion and $8 billion annually, and the direct onsite farm cost is estimated at $1 billion to $18 billion per year.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#4">(4)</A>  The United States Department of Agriculture, however, has expressed doubts about the reliability of these estimates.

<A NAME="CONDITIONS">CONDITIONS IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Of the 32 million acres of cropland in Texas, more than 12.8 million acres or 40 percent are classified as highly erodible.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#5">(5)</A>  With an average loss of 14 tons of soil per acre annually, Texas is one of the eight worst states for soil erosion rates.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#6">(6)</A>    
<P>
Water erosion is the primary concern for the central and eastern parts of Texas. Wind erosion is the primary concern in far west Texas and the High Plains region. Both wind and water are concerns in the Rolling Plains and southern parts of the state.
<P>
The Federal and State agencies that have major responsibility for the well-being of our soil are:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>The Consolidated Farm Service Agency, formerly known as the USDA Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Services.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#7">(7)</A> This is the USDA's state-level administrative arm. Since the 1930s, Texas and other states have received federal monies under the Agricultural Conservation Program for direct assistance to producers. Under this program, the Consolidated Farm Service Agency distributes approximately $13 million federal dollars annually to Texas producers to assist them in implementing 15 to 20 best management practices. These practices include terracing, ponds, wells, irrigation and agriculture waste facilities. In 1993, approximately $164,000,000 was distributed to Texas farmers under the Conservation Reserve Program.
	<P>
	<LI>The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, formerly the Soil Conservation Service. This service is responsible for all soil and water conservation programs, the Wetlands Reserve program and other programs related to natural resources conservation. Through a memorandum of understanding with local Soil Conservation Districts, the Service assists agricultural producers, on a voluntary basis, in designing site-specific conservation management plans. 
	<P>
	<LI>The Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board. This is a state agency with a five member Board elected by delegations from the soil conservation districts. The Board coordinates the activities of the Soil and Water Conservation Districts, develops a statewide conservation plan and is the lead agency for designing site-specific programs to abate non-point source pollution resulting from agriculture and silviculture. In fiscal year 1994, the Board received a state appropriation of $5,200,586. Almost $2 million of this was targeted for the non-point source pollution programs. For fiscal year 1995, the Board was appropriated $7,319,298, of which approximately $4,035,187 is targeted for non-point source pollution programs.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#8">(8)</A>
	<P>
	<LI>The Soil and Water Conservation Districts. There are 213 soil conservation districts in Texas. Most districts conform to county boundary lines. Each district has an elected board of directors made up of district landowners. Among other activities, the local Soil Conservation District Board coordinates the technical assistance to producers provided by USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. The districts also prepare long-range soil and water conservation plans for the area.   
	<P>
	<LI>The Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, formerly the Texas A&amp;M Extension Service. This Service provides a link between agricultural producers and agricultural research. Through county offices, it provides educational programs and materials to producers, farm workers and homeowners on such subjects as the proper use of agricultural chemicals, new agricultural technology and conservation practices.

<P>
Soil erosion levels vary among types of soil, and, of course, some erosion is natural and inevitable. The amount of soil erosion that most cropland can tolerate without reducing production is termed by the United States Department of Agriculture the "T" factor. In Texas, the "T" factor for most cropland is about five tons per acre per year.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#10">(10)</A>  Most Texas cropland can lose five tons of soil a year for an indefinite period of time without production being affected. The objective of conservation practices is to bring erosion down to or below this "T" factor.    
<P>
According to the Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board, total gross sheet and rill erosion within Texas averages about 229 million tons annually. This is an average annual rate of 1.36 tons per acre. Gross gully and stream erosion averages about 98 million tons annually, or an average rate of 0.58 tons per acre.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#11">(11)</A>
<P>
Soil erosion by water is a problem on about 24.3 million acres of Texas cropland and grassland.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#12">(12)</A> Figures are not available on the number of acres on which wind erosion has a large impact.

<H5>Texas Environmental Almanac, Chapter 6, Air  
Quality, Page 1
</H5>
Air pollution can be hazardous to human health. When people breathe dirty air, pollutants may come into direct contact with their lungs. Polluted air can burn eyes, irritate throats and affect breathing. Some chemicals emitted to the air can cause adverse health effects if released in large enough quantities or over a long enough time. These health effects could include cancer, birth defects, damage to the brain, nervous system or respiratory tract and even, in rare instances, death.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#1">(1)</A>
<P>
Air pollution also threatens plants, animals and the natural environment. Acid rain can destroy lakes, rivers and the organisms that inhabit them. Certain compounds degrade the ozone layer above the earth, which serves as a filter for the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. The thinning of this upper level atmospheric ozone layer may lead to higher rates of skin cancer and eye damage for both humans and animals. Other pollutants may stunt the growth of trees and vegetation, including agricultural crops, while increased carbon dioxide levels have been found to actually stimulate plant growth, emphasizing the complexity of air pollution problems. 
<P>
Common air pollutants can also damage property, dirtying buildings and corroding monuments and statues. And the haze produced by air pollution can reduce visibility, affecting a number of activities including airplane transportation and tourism.

<P>
<P>
The first efforts to deal legislatively with visible air pollution were directed at smoke emissions from steam boilers. Cincinnati and Chicago passed smoke regulations in 1881; Ohio passed a law to limit these emissions in 1897. It wasn't until the 1940s, however, that new designs which reduced black smoke and saved fuel were phased into factories.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#2">(2)</A> Much less effort was directed at controlling the grime and pollutants generated by oil and gas refineries, factory smokestacks, coal-burning locomotives and automobiles.
<P>
By the 1960s, new concerns were being raised about urban "smog." Smog is a haze made up of thousands of different compounds. Ozone is its most well known constituent. In fact, excessive ground level ozone is the most pervasive air pollution problem in the U.S., creating both health and environmental effects.
<P>
It may seem strange that too little ozone in the upper atmosphere is a problem while too much ozone on ground level is also a problem. However, these types of seeming contradictions are part and parcel of the interrelated air pollution control problems facing us today (see "What is Air Pollution?").
<P>
Smog and other air pollutants are particularly damaging when "trapped" at ground level. This may happen in areas that have experienced a temperature inversion, a meteorological phenomenon in which a warm layer of air lies under a cooler, denser layer. A temperature inversion creates a kind of atmospheric blanket that can prevent pollutants generated on the ground from escaping into the upper atmosphere. When a temperature inversion lingers in an area and winds are calm, air pollutants become concentrated. The results can be deadly; in 1948, a temperature inversion over the Pennsylvania town of Donora resulted in the deaths of 20 people and hospitalized hundreds when sulfur, ozone and air particulates were trapped at ground level.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#3">(3)</A>
<P>
In the wake of the Donora incident, Congress passed a series of bills to study and research the problem of air pollution. But it was not until the 1960 presidential campaign that political leaders began calling for a coordinated, national approach to the problem of air pollution. This concern over air pollution was focused first on the most visible forms of air pollution: smoke, smog and haze. Gradually, legislation has come to address less visible air pollution problems, such as toxic compounds, as well. 
<H4>
<A NAME="EVENTS">EVENTS IN THE QUEST FOR CLEANER AIR
</A></H4>
<P>
The following mark significant air pollution events and important steps taken to prevent their recurrence:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>  1948: </B>Air pollution trapped by a temperature inversion in Donora, Pennsylvania results in more than 6,000 inhabitants becoming sick and 20 deaths. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1952: </B>A 5-day temperature inversion in London in December, 1952 causes smoke from open fireplaces and industrial emissions to sicken thousands of Londoners and results in the premature deaths of 4,000 people, many of whom had preexisting heart and lung conditions.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#4">(4)</A>
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1963: </B>The Federal Clean Air Act provides funds to support state and local air pollution agencies, to initiate interstate air pollution research and to enforce interstate pollution laws. Because the main policy thrust is the protection of human health, this act is administered by the Public Health Service of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW).
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1965: </B>The Texas Air Control Board is created under the Texas Clean Air Act to protect Texas air quality by setting standards, criteria levels and emission limits. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1966: </B>A temperature inversion traps urban air pollution for three days in New York City. Epidemiologists attributes the deaths of 168 people to the episode.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#6">(6)</A> 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1967: </B>A revised Air Quality Act authorizes HEW to establish federal air-quality standards, requires states and local entities to monitor their "airsheds" - the air located above so-called air quality control regions covering 247 metropolitan areas throughout the U.S. - and requires states to establish standards for specific pollutants in these air quality control regions. However, only 21 states submit their required plan to HEW by the time the 1967 Act expires in 1970.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#7">(7)</A>
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1970: </B>Amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act limit emissions from cars, factories and power plants. The allowable level of sulfur dioxide from utility smokestacks is reduced; refineries are required to phase out lead from gasoline; and automakers are required to cut emissions by 90 percent by 1975. (Congress later gave the automobile industry until 1978 to meet auto air pollution standards after fierce opposition.) The 1970 Act also gives the newly created Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the power to establish national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) to protect human health and secondary standards to protect the environment. States are required to develop and implement plans to reduce air pollution to levels below these national standards by 1975. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1971: </B>Amendments to the Texas Clean Air Act authorize the Texas Air Control Board to issue air quality permits, which begin the following year. Sources of air pollution constructed before 1971, however, are "grandfathered" under the Texas Clean Air Act and do not need to obtain a state permit. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1972: </B>Texas submits the first State Implementation Plan prepared by the Texas Air Control Board to the EPA detailing measures for meeting National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) within the state for sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, total suspended particulates and ozone. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1973: </B>The Arab Oil Embargo leads Congress to pass the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1973. To ease pressure on the oil supply, the act requires power plants to switch their fuel sources from oil and natural gas to more polluting coals. It also temporarily suspends emission limits on power plants and other stationary sources like refineries.
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1977: </B>Amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act require companies to install new pollution-control equipment or face stiff penalties. The law also allows states to adopt emission limitations more stringent than federal standards and requires that coordinated transportation planning and clean air planning must take place at the local level. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1979: </B>The EPA relaxes the national ambient air quality standards for ozone, raising the permissible level from 0.08 to 0.12 parts per million.
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1979: </B>Texas submits a revised State Implementation Plan prepared by the Texas Air Control Board for achieving the NAAQS by December 1982 which results in significant emissions reductions from industry of criteria pollutants in most areas of the state. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1983: </B>The EPA decides to allow states additional time to submit State Implementation Plan revisions, where needed, and to negotiate the control strategy and rule provisions required to demonstrate attainment of the NAAQS.
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1984: </B>An industrial accident in Bhopal, India at a Union Carbide plant spews methyl isocyanate gas into the local area, killing more than 2,500 people, and hospitalizing tens of thousands.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#8">(8)</A> The event leads to international pressure for better emergency response plans at manufacturing plants and information regarding toxics releases.
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1985: </B>An accident at a Union Carbide plant in Institute, West Virginia sends a poisonous plume of aldicarb oxime over the town, sending 135 people to the hospital. Only a new chemical batching process, instituted at the West Virginia plant after the Bhopal accident, prevents the release of the more toxic methyl isocyanate.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#9">(9)</A>
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1985: </B>Amendments to the Texas Clean Air Act authorizes the Texas Air Control Board to levy administrative penalties for violations of state and national air quality regulations and operating permits are required to be reviewed at 15-year intervals. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1986: </B>The Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act requires companies to report to the Environmental Protection Agency both regular and accidental releases to the air, water or land of more than 300 toxic chemicals. The act also requires manufacturing companies to develop emergency response plans to use in the event of an accident.
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1987: </B>Texas submits a substantially revised State Implementation Plan prepared by the Texas Air Control Board to satisfy EPA requirements for demonstrating attainment of the ozone standard by the end of 1991. In addition, the agency's vehicle emissions inspection and maintenance program is expanded to counties surrounding several ozone non-attainment cities. 
	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1990: </B>Amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act, the most far-reaching air pollution prevention legislation ever passed, address airborne toxics, acid rain and the depletion of the ozone layer, and toughen regulations on vehicles, utilities and other sources of smog-producing emissions. 

	<P> 
	<LI><B>  1993: </B>The Texas Air Control Board, the Texas Water Commission and other agencies related to water pollution control merge to form the newly-created Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.

<A NAME="POLLUTION">*</A><center>
<table border=5 width="85%">
<tr><th>What is Air Pollution?</th></tr>
<tr><td>There are many different aspects of air pollution. Whether the pollution is likely to cause environmental or health effects depends on the concentration of pollutants and the amount of time an individual or other receptor is exposed to them. 
<P>
<B>Smog</B> is an often visible haze made up of thousands of constituents, the most abundant, but not necessarily the most toxic of which is ozone. Ozone, especially at elevated levels, can create breathing problems particularly in the young, the old and persons with existing health problems by reducing lung function, increasing sensitivity to asthma and aging lung tissue. It is suspected to irritate the eyes, cause nasal congestion and reduce resistance to colds and other infections. Ozone at elevated levels is toxic to other living organisms as well; it damages plants and trees by affecting the stability of cell walls.
<P>
<B>Particulate matter</B>, produced by the burning of wood, diesel and other fuels, by agricultural activities and industrial processes and by traffic on unpaved roads, is made up of ash, smoke, soot, dust, fibers and liquid droplets. Particulate matter produces a haze that can cause visibility problems. It also dirties and damages buildings and clothes. Smaller particulates, which float in the air, can be inhaled deeply and, with elevated concentrations over an extended period of time, can cause lung damage and bronchitis.<I> </I>Recent studies have linked exposure to these smallest particles to a greater risk of premature death.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#5">(5)</A>
<P>
<B>Nitrogen oxides </B>result from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, natural gas, gasoline and oil. At present, automobiles are the main source of nitrogen oxide emissions in urban areas. Nitrogen oxides, at elevated concentrations, can damage the respiratory system. They also can be a key ingredient in the formation of both ozone and acid rain. 
<P>
<B>Sulfur dioxide </B>is released when sulfur-containing fuels like coal and oil are burned. Common sources of sulfur dioxide emissions are electric utilities and certain industrial processes. Sulfur dioxide at elevated concentrations can cause respiratory problems. It also can be a contributing component of acid rain.
<P>
<B>Toxic chemicals such as benzene, toluene and 1,1,1 trichloroethane</B>, when present in the air that we breathe in elevated concentrations over time, can cause various health effects including birth defects, cancer and other health problems. Sources of toxic emissions include industrial processes, such as refineries and chemical manufacturers, small businesses such as printers and dry cleaners and automobiles. 
<P>
<B>Carbon Monoxide (CO)</B> is formed when fuel does not burn completely. Cars and trucks are the main contributors. Carbon monoxide interferes with the blood's ability to transport oxygen to cells and tissues. Exposure to elevated levels of carbon monoxide can cause drowsiness, headaches and sometimes death. Carbon monoxide is particularly hazardous to those who have heart disease or pre-existing lung conditions.
<P>
<B>Lead</B> is a heavy metal that persists in the environment for decades. The former use of leaded gasoline, which is no longer commercially available in most of the United States, the manufacture of lead-based paint and lead-acid battery reclamation operations are sources of lead in the air. Emissions from metal smelters are another source. Exposure to lead at high levels and over time can cause brain and other nervous system damage, particularly in children. Excess exposure to lead can also harm wildlife and is known to cause cancer in animals. 
<P>
<B>Acid Rain</B> forms when the sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emitted from fossil fuel-burning plants and other combustion processes combine with rain, fog or snow in the atmosphere. Over time, with conducive geologic conditions, acid rain can increase the acidities of lakes, streams and soils, disturbing or destroying local environments. Wind can carry pollutants far away from where they originated, creating problems in other states or countries.

<H5>Texas Environmental Almanac, Chapter 7, Texas Energy, Page 1
</H5>
<A NAME="TEXAS">American</A> Indians were the first to utilize Texas' vast energy resources. In addition to the wood they harvested from the state's immense forests, the Lipan Apache, Comanches and Kiowas used dried buffalo dung for heating and cooking. Archaeological records show tribal groups along the coast used naturally occurring tar to seal their baskets. They also used the thick oil that seeped from the ground to put handles on their tools and affix dart points to their arrows. Archaeological sites near Lake Lewisville show the first Texas settlers collected and burned lignite some 8,000 years before the arrival of Europeans.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#1">(1)</A> 
<P>
Coal was the first fossil fuel used by white settlers. Surface supplies were used throughout the early 1800s and mining of coal began in the 1850s. Coal continues to be an integral part of Texas' energy mix. Over the past two decades, the state has produced 652 million tons of soft coal (also called lignite), the equivalent of 1.5 billion barrels of oil.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#2">(2)</A> Texas is the sixth largest producer of coal in the U.S. and the state has only begun to mine this vast resource. More than 24 billion tons of lignite still lie beneath the surface. 
<P>
Since the state's first big oil discovery at Spindletop in 1901, Texas has produced 54 billion barrels of oil, providing trillions of dollars in tax revenues to state government and thousands of jobs to residents. Texas oil was a critical ingredient in the Allied war effort in World War II. The "Big Inch" and "Little Big Inch" pipelines carried much-needed Texas petroleum to industrial facilities on the East Coast. From there, Texas oil was shipped to Europe for use by Allied forces. 
<P>
The Texas energy industry has survived periods of boom and bust. In 1929, Texas was the biggest oil-producing province in the world. By 1930, high-grade oil was selling for $1.10 per barrel (42 gallons). But the following year, the market fell apart. The huge East Texas Field near Kilgore began producing a million barrels of oil per day, far more than the market could absorb. Prices plummeted and Texas oil was selling for just 10 cents a barrel.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#3">(3)</A> The problems of oversupply and disarray in the market forced the state to take action, and in 1932, the state legislature authorized the Railroad Commission of Texas to limit oil production.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#4">(4)</A> By setting limits on the amount of oil that each field could produce, the Commission was able to prevent floods of oil from coming onto the market. But the Railroad Commission has not been able to insulate the industry from price upheavals. Another boom in the early 1980s caused a surge in oil drilling, which fell apart four years later. 
<P>
The 1980s were not kind to the oil industry. Nationwide, nearly half a million Americans lost jobs in the oil industry. More jobs were lost in the energy business than in the steel and auto industries combined. In Texas, between 1981 and 1992, 24 refineries closed, the number of active drilling rigs declined from 1,300 to 209 and 160,000 Texans lost jobs in the oil and gas sector.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#5">(5)</A> In 1981, the oil and gas industry accounted for 25 percent of the gross state product. By 1993, it had fallen by more than half, to 12 percent.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#6">(6)</A> By the year 2015, oil and gas is expected to account for less than 8 percent of the gross state product.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#7">(7)</A> 
<P>
State tax revenues from oil have also fallen. During the 1950s the state routinely got a third of its tax revenue from oil and gas taxes. Today, the state gets less than 7 percent of total revenues from oil and gas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#8">(8)</A>
<P>
With 17 million residents, Texas has about 7 percent of the U.S. population, but in 1989, the state accounted for 12 percent of the nation's total energy usage. Texas consumes more electricity, natural gas, coal and petroleum than any other state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#9">(9)</A> 
<P>
Today, the Texas energy industry is at a cross- roads. Oil production in the state is falling. Natural gas consumption is increasing but reserves are shrinking. Coal use has risen sharply. For the first time, Texas faces the prospect of becoming a net energy importer. The state whose vast oil resources once played a critical role in national defense may soon be dependent on other states and foreign countries to meet demand.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#10">(10)</A> 
<P>
Much of the state's energy demand comes from its huge appetite for electricity. Electricity demand in the state is now growing at about 2.5 percent per year.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#11">(11)</A> More than half the new electricity coming on-line will be generated by coal-fired power plants, with one-third of the coal coming from Wyoming.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#12">(12)</A> 
<P>
Nuclear power is meeting some of the demand for electricity. The state now has 4,802 megawatts of installed nuclear generating capacity. Texas was once a dominant producer of uranium, the element that provides fuel for the nuclear energy industry. However, the market for uranium has gone soft and most of Texas' uranium mining sites are now dormant.
<P>
Harnessing the hot Texas sun and corralling the swift Texas breeze could allow the state to get much of its energy from non-polluting, renewable sources. Solar power could also supply much of the state's electricity. Studies have shown that one sunny acre of land in West Texas could produce the energy equivalent of 800 barrels of oil per year.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#13">(13)</A> If Texas captured all of its wind resources, it could supply 10 percent of electricity needs of the contiguous United States.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#14">(14)</A> In Texas, the wind alone could generate 136,000 megawatts of electricity, or more than twice the state's installed generating capacity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#15">(15)</A> 
<P>
Despite the promise of wind, solar, biomass and other renewable technologies, large amounts of capital and significant changes in government policies will be needed to develop those resources. In the meantime, the state will have to increase efficiency or meet new electricity demand through conventional sources, such as coal, oil or natural gas, or through the construction of new nuclear plants. 
<P>
Much of the demand for electricity could be reduced through conservation and improved efficiency of engines, motors, refrigerators, air conditioners, lights and other products. However, large electricity producers are not spending much money on efficiency improvements. The state's largest utilities are spending just $40 million per year on programs to increase electrical efficiency.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#16">(16)</A> For comparison, Texans spent $14 billion on electricity purchases in 1991. In other words, Texas utilities spent just .003 percent of their total income on energy efficiency programs. 
<P>
Some estimates show that conservation alone could reduce demand for electricity in the state by one-third. By one estimate, if Texas utilities adopted an aggressive conservation policy, consumers could be saving up to $2.5 billion annually by the year 2010. While consumers would save money on their power bills, utilities could avoid spending some $8.4 billion for new power plants and infrastructure.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#20">(20)</A>
<P>
Energy efficiency and renewable energy resources will play critical roles in Texas' energy mix as the state heads into the 21st century. The state must soon address the need to reduce consumption of fossil fuels in order to meet the goals of the Global Climate Change Treaty. Signed by the U.S. and a host of other nations, the treaty requires signatories to limit CO2 emissions to 1990 levels. As the country's largest energy consuming state, Texas leads the nation in production of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to global warming. The global warming issue and the 1990 Clean Air Act, which requires businesses in the state to reduce their sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions (see Air Section), could force Texas to change its energy consumption patterns.
<P>
Over the next few decades, Texas will also see increased energy trade with Mexico. Even before the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, Texas was sending huge amounts of energy to its southern neighbor. In northern Mexico, where rapid industrialization has led to increasing demand for natural gas and electricity, natural gas (mainly from Texas fields) is fueling growth. In 1988, Mexico bought 2.3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas from the U.S. By 1991, that figure jumped to 91 Bcf. By the year 2000, it has been predicted that Mexico will buy 300 Bcf of American gas per year.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#21">(21)</A> 
<P>
Texas may also start selling electricity to its neighbor. Since 1972, electric power consumption in Mexico has more than tripled and over the next decade, demand for electricity is expected to double.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#22">(22)</A>

<H4><A NAME="HISTORY">A SHORT </A>HISTORY OF SOLID WASTE
</H4>
<P>
The question of what to do with trash has been of concern to every society. Humans have essentially used the same four methods to deal with trash: reduce it, reuse it, dump it, and burn it.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#1">(1)</A> But it was not until the late 19th century that a systematic municipally-run waste collection system was put in place in the United States. The system started in New York City where, under the direction of the Street Cleaning Commission, 1,000 men clad in white, known as the "Apostles of Cleanliness," transported trash from the streets to dumps and incinerators.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#2">(2)</A> By 1910, most municipalities across the country had established some system of waste collection and disposal.
<P>
In the past twenty years, a substantial body of state and federal legislation regulating the disposal of industrial, hazardous and municipal solid waste (MSW) has been developed. Before that time, solid waste management depended on the judgment and decisions of individuals or local departments of health and sanitation. There was no distinction made between industrial and municipal solid waste - each was handled and disposed of in the same manner, mainly through landfilling, incineration or discharging into rivers and streams. Significant federal regulations governing the disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste did not go into effect until 1976, two years before the contamination of Love Canal was reported. In what seems to be a natural evolution of environmental law, federal waste legislation fell in place right on the heels of national water and air pollution control legislation. Concern for human health and the environment was the impetus for the enactment of the major federal legislation - the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA). 
<P>
During the crafting of RCRA, Congress knew it had the opportunity both to regulate disposal methods and to reduce the generation of waste by regulating production and products. Several bills were introduced to minimize waste by regulating product contents, consumer product packaging and manufacturing processes; these bills did not pass. For both solid waste and hazardous waste, Congress made a policy decision to regulate waste disposal rather than encourage source reduction.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#3">(3)</A>

<A NAME="FEDERAL">SIGNIFICANT</A> FEDERAL WASTE LEGISLATION
</H4>
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>  In 1965, Congress made its first attempt to define the scope of the nation's waste disposal problems by enacting the Federal Solid Waste Disposal Act. This financed statewide surveys of landfills and illegal dumps.
	<P>
	<LI>  In 1976, Congress passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Most of the landmark legislation dealt with hazardous waste under Subtitle C, but Subtitle D of RCRA directed the EPA to set federal standards for the management of industrial and municipal non-hazardous solid waste in sanitary landfills.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#4">(4)</A>
	<P>
	<LI>  In 1984, Congress passed the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments. One of the intents of the EPA was to revise the original landfill criteria to ensure that landfills that may receive hazardous household waste or hazardous waste from small quantity generators are protective of human health and the environment. States were required to adopt and implement a permit program that incorporated the EPA revisions. The EPA was then required to determine if such programs were adequate; if not, the EPA would enforce the criteria within the state. Texas received approval for its RCRA Subtitle D program in 1993.
	<P>
	<LI>  In 1990, Congress passed the Pollution Prevention Act which established a federal hierarchy of preferred waste management methods for municipal solid waste and industrial waste.

<A NAME="SOLID">SIGNIFICANT</A> TEXAS SOLID WASTE LEGISLATION
</H4>
<P>
<UL>
  	<LI>Texas has a long-standing municipal solid waste regulatory program, which was initiated with the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act, passed by the state legislature in 1969. This legislation charged the Texas Department of Health with regulating municipal solid waste (MSW). Industrial solid waste was placed under the jurisdiction of the Texas Water Quality Board, predecessor of the former Texas Water Commission. The Solid Waste Disposal Act required the Texas Health Department to adopt regulations pertaining to the design, construction and operation of landfills and other types of municipal solid waste management facilities and required many types of municipal waste management facilities to obtain a permit from the Department before beginning their operations.<A HREF="NOTES8.HTML#5">(5)</A> In 1985, the hazardous waste portion of the MSW program was transferred to the Texas Water Commmission and consolidated with the industrial hazardous waste program. The Solid Waste Disposal Act was amended in 1991 to transfer jurisdiction over municipal solid waste to the Texas Water Commission, the predecessor agency of the current Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC).
</UL>
<P>
Five other major pieces of state legislation have been passed relating to municipal solid waste management:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>  In 1983, the Comprehensive Municipal Solid Waste Management, Resource Recovery and Conservation Act established the Municipal Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery Advisory Council and prescribed procedures and criteria for those regional planning agencies and local governments which wished to develop solid waste management plans. 
	<P>
	<LI>  In 1987, House Bill 2051 established a preferred hierarchy, as a state policy, for the management of hazardous waste, municipal waste and municipal sludge.
	<P>
	<LI>  In 1989, Senate Bill 1519 established a solid waste disposal fee program to fund the state's MSW regulatory program and provide funding for other MSW related statewide programs. The Bill also changed the voluntary state regional and local solid waste management planning program into a mandatory program with state funding provided for the development of those plans. The 24 regional planning agencies, or Councils of Governments (COGS), are responsible for developing these plans and the TNRCC awards the planning grants.
	<P>
	<LI>  In 1991, Senate Bill 1340, the Omnibus Recycling Act, set statewide recycling goals and directed the General Land Office, the Railroad Commission of Texas, the Texas Department of Commerce and the Texas Water Commission (now TNRCC) to conduct a comprehensive market development study that would result in a strategy to stimulate markets for recycled goods. The Legislature set a goal of 40 percent recycling for municipal solid waste by January 1, 1994. The legislation also established fees on the sale of tires and automotive oil, with the fees directed toward programs for collection of used oil and old tires and mandated state agencies to give preference to recycled materials in their purchasing.  The Bill also mandated the recycling of lead-acid (automotive) batteries, and House Bill 1986 established a fee on the sale of lead-acid batteries with the revenues dedicated to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Remediation Fund.
	<P>
	<LI>  In 1993, Senate Bill 1051 was passed in order to expand SB 1340's programs and to change the 40 percent <I>recycling</I> goal established in 1991 to a 40 percent <I>reduction</I> goal of the total amount of municipal solid waste disposed in the state through source reduction and recycling.
	<P>
	<LI>  In 1993, House Bill 2537 addressed the risks associated with methane gas releases from closed landfills by establishing a process for the TNRCC to review proposals and issue permits to build atop closed municipal solid waste landfills.

<H5>Texas Environmental Almanac, Chapter 9, Industrial Waste, Page 1
</H5>

<A NAME="SINCE">Since</A> the industrial revolution, industrial and mining operations have been accompanied by a problem: industrial waste which may be toxic, ignitable, corrosive or reactive. If improperly managed, this waste can pose dangerous health and environmental consequences. In the United States, the amount of hazardous waste generated by manufacturing industries in the country has increased from an estimated 4.5 million tons annually after World War II to some 57 million tons by 1975.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#1">(1)</A> By 1990, this total had shot up to approximately 265 million tons.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#2">(2)</A> This waste is generated at every stage in the production process, use and disposal of manufactured products. Thus, the introduction of many new products for the home and office -  computers, drugs, textiles, paints and dyes, plastics - also introduced hazardous waste, including toxic chemicals, into the environment. These, too, must be managed with extreme care to avoid adverse environmental or human health impacts. The EPA estimated in 1980 that more than 70,000 different chemicals were being manufactured in the U.S., with some 1,000 new chemicals being added each year.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#3">(3)</A> The human health and environmental impacts of many of these chemicals are largely unknown.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#4">(4)</A> 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> <I>While tens of thousands of industrial chemicals are used in the United States and have the potential to enter the food supply through air, water and soil pollution, no law requires federal agencies to monitor environmental contaminants in food.</I> 
	<P>
	<I>Source: United States General Accounting Office, </I>Minimizing Unsafe Chemicals in Foods <I>(Washington, DC: September 1994), 3.</I>
</UL>
<P>
Before substantial state and federal regulation began in the late 1970s, most industrial waste was disposed of in landfills, stored in surface impoundments such as lagoons or pits, discharged into surface waters with little or no treatment or burned. Mismanagement of industrial as well as "hazardous" waste has resulted in polluted groundwater, streams, lakes and rivers as well as damage to wildlife and vegetation.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#5">(5)</A> Meanwhile, high levels of toxic contaminants have been found in animals and humans, particularly those, like farm workers and oil and gas workers, who are continually exposed to such waste streams.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#6">(6)</A> 
<P>
Today, three major federal laws and one state law guide management of hazardous waste and other industrial waste in Texas:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>  <B>Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act, </B>enacted in 1969 and last amended in 1993. This act authorizes a full state regulatory program for solid waste including industrial and hazardous waste under the jurisdiction of what today is called the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (formerly the Texas Water Commission). It sets out various permitting and enforcement authorities and restricts the location, design and operation of hazardous waste management facilities. 
	 <P>
	<LI>  <B> Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976</B>. As re-authorized in 1984 by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments, this federal law creates a step-by-step management approach restricting and controlling the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste onto the land; mandates a permitting system to assure the safe management of all hazardous waste; and implements a system to track hazardous waste as it moves "cradle-to-grave," from the point of generation to disposal. The 1984 amendments also banned hazardous waste which could threaten human health and the environment from land disposal without prior treatment. 
	 <P>
	<LI>  CERCLA, the Comprehensive Emergency Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, amended in 1986 as the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act (SARA). This federal law created a $1.6 billion "Superfund" to address spills of hazardous waste and clean up of old, abandoned hazardous waste sites.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#7">(7)</A> The Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act provided an additional $12.1 billion.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#8">(8)</A> Title III of SARA, the Emergency Planning and Community-Right-to-Know Act of 1986, requires major industries to report releases, transfers and recycling of toxic chemicals to the Environmental Protection Agency as part of the Toxics Release Inventory Program. 
	 <P>
	<LI>  Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, amended in 1986. This act, along with RCRA, protects groundwater sources of potable water and regulates underground injection of industrial and hazardous waste.

<A NAME="WHAT">INDUSTRIAL</A> AND HAZARDOUS WASTE: WHAT IS IT?
</H4>
<P>
According to EPA estimates, manufacturing, mining and agricultural industries, along with commercial and domestic sources in the U.S., generate about 8 billion tons of waste each year, about 265 million tons of which were hazardous in 1990 under RCRA.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#9">(9)</A> That same year, municipal solid waste - what is picked up at our homes, businesses and institutions - made up only 196 million tons, or around 2.5 percent of all generated waste.
<P>
Industrial solid waste - which may be solid, liquid or gases held in containers - is divided into hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Hazardous waste may result from manufacturing or other industrial processes. Certain commercial products such as cleaning fluids, paints or pesticides discarded by commercial establishments or individuals can also be defined as hazardous waste. While RCRA does provide a general definition of hazardous waste, the hazardous waste "definition" has been further refined through regulations (see box). 
<H4>
<A NAME="NON">NON-HAZARDOUS</A> INDUSTRIAL WASTE
</H4>
<P>
Non-hazardous industrial waste are those that do not meet the EPA's definition of hazardous waste - and are not municipal waste. Waste determined to be hazardous are regulated by hazardous waste rules established pursuant to RCRA's Subtitle C requirements, while other non-hazardous waste fall under RCRA's Subtitle D solid waste management requirements. 
<P>
Under Texas regulations, non-hazardous waste generated by industrial facilities are categorized as Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3 waste (see box). Class 2 and Class 3 waste are considered less harmful to the environment or human health than Class 1 waste. While industries do have to report the type of waste they produce, they do not have to report how much of Class 2 and 3 waste they generate or how they dispose of them. However, municipal solid waste landfills do have to report the receipt of all industrial waste, including Class 2 and 3 waste.

<P>

We want to begin this first <b>Texas Environmental Almanac </b>by telling you what it is not. It is not a prescription for change. It is not a definitive description of the environmental health of the state. It is an environmental road map of our state, drawn from documentation compiled by state agencies with a mandated responsibility for various components of the state's environment. By studying this road map, we can begin to understand where we are in terms of our state's environmental health. We can begin to decide where we want to be in terms of the future environmental well-being of Texas.
<P>
The <b>Texas Environmental Almanac</b> was created to provide timely information on the state of the state's environment. This information can help citizens and their elected officials plan for the future and design future policy. While various state agencies maintain on-going documentation of key components of the state's environment, this documentation rarely reaches the public or elected officials in a format that is useful for public debate or for guiding public policy decisions. Never before has the environmental documentation by various state agencies been brought together under one cover to provide a comprehensive look at the Texas environment. It is our hope that the Almanac will serve as a useful reference book for anyone studying the Texas environment as well as for those engaged in public debates shaping environmental policy.
<P>
Environmental protection continues to be a major concern of most Texans, according to a 1994 survey conducted by the Rice University Department of Sociology and sponsored by the Southwestern Bell Foundation. "Most Texans continue to believe that greater efforts should be made to protect the environment, and they are willing to make some economic sacrifices to do so," the report concluded.  "...[T]he commitment to environmental protection remains surprisingly strong in Texas."<A HREF="#1">(1)</A>
<P>
A study released by the Institute for Southern Studies indicates that environmental protection and economic development are not necessarily as incompatible as conventional wisdom would have us believe. In fact, some elements of an environmental protection policy may enhance economic development. "States with stronger environmental standards tended to have higher growth in their gross state products, total employment, construction employment, and labor productivity than states that ranked lower environmentally," reported Dr. Stephen Meyer of the Massachusetts Institute for Technology, after tracking 20 years of economic performance by state.<A HREF="#2">(2)</A> In a report for the Economic Policy Institute, Dr. Eban Goodstein reports that "when the job creation aspects of pollution control policies are factored in, environmental protection has probably increased net employment in the U.S. economy by a small amount."<A HREF="#3">(3)</A>
<P>
According to the Rice University survey, however, most Texans are more concerned about the detrimental effects of pollution than they are about the impact of environmental regulation on the economy.<A HREF="#4">(4)</A> In the long run, the economic health of a city, region or the entire state depends upon the integrity of the natural resources upon which that city, region or the state depends. 
<P>
Looking at some of the information in the <b>Texas Environmental Almanac</b> allows us to see how this plays out in our own state. We are, for instance, doing some things right. Since 1972, the amount of pollution discharged in wastewater by Texas municipal facilities has decreased by approximately 70 percent. While the population of Texas grew from 14 million in 1980 to 17 million in 1990, the amount of water Texas residents, industries and agriculture consumed declined from 17.8 million acre-feet in 1980 to 15.8 million acre-feet by 1990. Texas industries have reduced their release of toxic compounds into the air by more than 25 percent since 1987.
<P>
But the evidence suggests we could do a better job in many areas. Texas industries, for instance, inject more hazardous wastes and toxic chemicals underground than any other state in the nation. We release more toxic waste into the air, water and land than any state except Louisiana. Approximately 150,000 Texas residents living on the border do not have basic wastewater treatment service. Texas loses approximately 225 acres of Gulf shoreline per year to erosion. The state has lost one-half of its coastal wetlands and 60 percent of its terrestrial wetlands over the past 200 years. Forty percent of Texas cropland is classified as highly erodible, making Texas one of the eight worst states for soil erosion rates. Environmental losses such as these, if not addressed, could have a seriously detrimental effect in years to come on the quality of life and the economic prosperity of thousands of Texans. By using information found in the Almanac, we may be able to avert growing environmental problems before it is too late.
<P>
The <b>Texas Environmental Almanac </b>is divided into five sections. We've taken the classic environmental elements once believed to characterize all material substance: earth (land), air, fire (energy) and water. To this we've added a new element: waste. Taken as a whole, these sections provide a comprehensive portrait of the state of the state's environment.
<P>
The Texas Center for Policy Studies (TCPS) has been responsible for writing and organizing the almanac. Mary Sanger directed the project. She and Cyrus Reed, both TCPS staff members, were the chief writers and researchers for the almanac. Mary Kelly, Antonio Diaz, Loretta Baron and Geoff Rips, also from TCPS, provided research and editorial assistance. Free-lance writer Robert Bryce contributed the section on energy. Susan Raleigh Kaderka provided first-round editing. Worldwise Design Creative Director Harrison Saunders designed the <I>Almanac </I>and saw it through production. Sherry Matthews Advertising and Public Relations (Austin) provided copy editing, conceptual and design assistance and was crucial to final publication.
<P>
The <b>Texas Environmental Almanac</b> depended upon the cooperation and collaboration of many state agencies, including the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC), the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the General Land Office, the Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board, the Consolidated Farm Service Agency, the Texas Water Development Board and the Railroad Commission of Texas. All these agencies provided access to technical reports and other data, as well as offering guidance and helpful comments.
<P>
Finally, the <b>Texas Environmental Almanac </b>would not have been possible without the generous support of the Meadows Foundation in Dallas. The Foundation's support and encouragement are gratefully acknowledged.

<P>
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed in December 1992 and approved by the U.S. Congress in the Fall of 1993. The agreement, which strengthens trade relationships between the United States, Mexico and Canada, was the culmination of more than 3 years of sometimes difficult negotiations between the countries. Part of the public debate surrounding NAFTA centered on the environment, especially the implications of increased U.S./Mexico economic integration for the border environment. To address some of these concerns, NAFTA was accompanied by environmental "side agreements" setting up new binational and trinational agencies to deal with some of the environmental issues.<A HREF="#1">(1)</A> Both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) have strengthened their border-related operations.

BORDER ISSUES: A HISTORICAL VIEW
</H4>
<P>
In 1965, Mexico initiated the Border Industrialization Program, widely known now as the <I>maquiladora</I> program. Under this program, foreign companies (primarily from the United States and Asia) could construct factories in Mexico and import parts and materials to those factories duty-free. Final products from the factories could then be exported back out of Mexico, with a duty paid only on the "value-added" during manufacture or assembly.<A HREF="#2">(2)</A>
<P>
Some <B>maquiladoras </B>were established during the 1970s, but the largest increase came after a 1982 devaluation of the Mexican currency, the peso. By 1991, there were almost 700 <I>maquiladoras </I>located in the Mexican border cities across the Rio Grande, with the largest concentrations being in Juarez (more than 300), Matamoros (94) and Reynosa (82).<A HREF="#3">(3)</A> 
<P>
While the <B>maquiladora </B>program achieved its purpose of providing jobs for Mexican workers, it also attracted a growing population to the border (See: Population Increases in Texas/Mexico Border Area). In addition, as a developing country, Mexico was not fully equipped to cope with the environmental implications of the rapid industrial development at its northern border.<A HREF="#4">(4)</A> 
<P>
The environmental and public health implications of rapid population growth and industrial development at the border drew increasing attention during the NAFTA debate. Attention was focused on several issues, including:<A HREF="#5">(5)</A>
<P>
<UL>
 	<LI>The lack of wastewater treatment and drinking water systems for Mexican border cities and for colonia developments on the Texas side of the border;
	<P>
 	<LI>Problems in tracking and accounting for hazardous waste generated at maquiladora plants; and
	<P>
 	<LI>Concerns about industrial air and water pollution associated with maquiladora plants and other border industry.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
</H4>
<P>
The increasing awareness of border issues has led both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission to strengthen their border programs. For example, in early 1992, the EPA and the Mexican federal environmental agency released their "Integrated Border Environmental Plan" after a series of public hearings on both sides of the border.<A HREF="#6">(6)</A> More recently, the EPA has established an office in El Paso, Texas to help coordinate its border-related efforts and the U.S. and Mexico have begun a process to update the 1992 plan by developing the "Border 2000" plan as a guide for their efforts to clean up border pollution over the next few years.
<P>
In 1993, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission established an Office of Border Affairs and Environmental Equity. This office coordinates Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission's efforts to better track hazardous waste movements across the border and to conduct monitoring of air and water quality in the region. It also tracks federal activities with respect to border environmental issues and works with state environmental departments in the four Mexican states that border Texas. 
<P>
In addition to these federal and state efforts, the NAFTA environmental side agreements established some new institutions which have a role in trying to protect the U.S./Mexico border environment.
<P>
The North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation (NACEC) is a trinational organization headed by the environmental ministers of the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Its charge is to examine a variety of North American environmental and trade issues, but one focus will be transboundary environmental management in the U.S./Mexico border region.
<P>
The NAFTA side agreements also resulted in the establishment of the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC) and the North American Development Bank (NADBank). Working in tandem, these two new binational institutions will help fund new infrastructure facilities to deal with water supply, wastewater treatment and municipal solid waste needs in the U.S./Mexico border region. When fully-funded, the NADBank will have $450 million capitalization, as well as $2.55 billion in "callable" capital. The bank will be able to make loans, loan guarantees or issue credit enhancements to help local border communities finance environmental infrastructure projects that have been certified by the Border Environmental Cooperation Commission.

<H4>
A CHALLENGE FOR THE STATE OF TEXAS
</H4>
<P>
Citizen groups and environmental organizations have for years challenged state and federal governmental agencies to respond to the environmental and public-health hazards disproportionately affecting low-income communities and communities of color. With President Clinton's signing of the Executive Order on Environmental Justice on February 11, 1994, environmental justice gained recognition as a national priority. The State of Texas has been in the forefront of addressing this important issue; in 1993 the heads of the state's two environmental regulatory agencies jointly appointed an Environmental Equity and Justice Task Force. Shortly afterwards, an Environmental Equity Office was established at the state environmental regulatory agency. 
<P>
An increasing body of research has confirmed claims by environmental justice leaders that toxic pollution disproportionally affects their communities. According to a recent analysis of 64 empirical studies on environmental impacts on communities, racial disparities were found more frequently than income disparities. The review also shows that racial disparities were found for a whole range of environmental hazards, including air pollution, pesticide exposure and the proximity to noxious facilities.<A HREF="#1">(1)</A>
<P>
Moreover, according to a 1992 analysis of the EPA's enforcement of Superfund laws by the <I>National Law Journal</I>, glaring procedural inequities exist. The <I>National Law Journal</I> report states: "There is a racial divide in the way the U.S. government cleans up toxic waste sites and punishes polluters. White communities see faster action, better results and stiffer penalties than communities where blacks, Hispanics and other minorities live. This unequal protection occurs whether the community is wealthy or poor."<A HREF="#2">(2)</A> As the <I>Journal</I> report reveals, discrepancies exist in the enforcement of environmental laws, such as penalties imposed, and in the pace of cleanup. 
<P>
Several events gave rise to the movement for environmental justice in Texas. In recent years at least a half-dozen citizen-based groups in Texas communities of color started organizing around environmental and public health issues. A West Dallas Latino and African American community was fighting the effects of lead contamination. African American residents of the Carver Terrace neighborhood in Texarkana found their community was built on an abandoned creosote plant. The Concerned Citizens of North Athens were fighting the siting of a proposed hazardous waste management facility slated for construction across the street from a low-income African American neighborhood. Latino community groups in Rosenberg, Austin and El Paso were battling authorities about toxic dangers in their midst. For example, in Rosenberg, Concerned Citizens for Community Development opposed the expansion of a landfill in their low-income, Mexican American neighborhood. Regional and statewide networks, such as the Southwest Network for Environmental and Economic Justice and the Texas Network for Environmental and Economic Justice, began to bring together grassroots organizations of people of color to address these issues at the state, regional and national levels.
<P>
As a result of these and other efforts to bring visibility to environmental justice issues, Texas Air Control Board Chair Kirk Watson and Texas Water Commission Chair John Hall in January l993 created the Environmental Equity and Justice Task Force. The first of its kind in the nation, this task force was created expressly to "ensure that public benefits resulting from the work of [the] new consolidated environmental agency will be fully and equitably realized by low-income communities and communities of color, taking into account the greater degree of hazard to which some communities are already exposed."<A HREF="#3">(3)</A>
<P>
The Task Force included representatives of the major oil companies, the Texas Association of Business, environmental groups, state agencies and city and county officials. In August 1993, the task force presented its report to the agencies. The report recommended, among other items: developing a comprehensive database with demographic information to help the agency in comprehensive environmental planning; encouraging local governments to develop master plans that include environmental and public-health provisions; and encouraging regulatory agencies to develop information which meets the diverse language needs of communities of color.  
<P>
Soon after, the Commissioners of the newly created Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission established an Environmental Equity Office within the TNRCC to implement the report's recommendations. Citizen groups and environmental organizations continue to monitor the implementation process and continue to advocate for additional policy changes.

<CENTER><IMG SRC="line.gif" ALT="Line" WIDTH="100%"></CENTER><BR>


<P>
Mitigation is the attempt to offset potential adverse effects of human activity on the environment. The development of mitigation measures has become an integral part of the regulatory process and of conservation planning efforts. 
<P>
The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires that mitigation measures be included in environmental impact statements (EIS) - the detailed studies of the environmental effects of major actions undertaken, funded or permitted by the federal government. 
<P>
Texas also has established state mitigation policies. For example, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the General Land Office require mitigation for adverse impacts on wetlands.<A HREF="#1">(1)</A> There is also a statutory requirement for mitigation for fish and wildlife habitat lost to large reservoir development projects.<A HREF="#2">(2)</A> The General Land Office has an informal policy requiring at least a three-to-one compensation ratio for unavoidable adverse impacts to natural resources on state-owned submerged land.<A HREF="#3">(3)</A> Many state natural resource regulations, moreover, must meet minimum federal standards, which often include mitigation requirements. For example, regulations governing highway construction require revegetation of lands damaged by road development. 
<P>
Most federal or state legislation requiring mitigation measures does not prescribe the specific mitigation activity that must take place, and mitigation can take many forms. Unfortunately, enforcement of mitigation commitments is sometimes sporadic.<A HREF="#4">(4)</A> For instance, rarely does anyone monitor to see if a developer or an agency has kept its promise to replace a natural wetland with a man-made one. 
<P>
The National Environmental Policy Act regulations define mitigation as follows:<A HREF="#5">(5)</A> 
<P>
<OL>
	<LI>Avoiding adverse impacts by not taking an action. (For example, the Texas State Department of Transportation rerouted a section of State Highway 71 to avoid destroying large old oak trees.) 
	<P>
	<LI>Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree of action. (For example, the state has built several Austin freeways that cross aquifer recharge areas without frontage roads. This approach is intended to help limit development near the freeway in order to help protect water quality in the aquifer.)
	<P>
	<LI>Rectifying by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment. (For example, coal companies operating in some parts of the state are required to design reclamation projects, including revegetation of mined areas.) 
	<P>
	<LI>Reducing or eliminating impacts over time through preservation and maintenance activities. 
	<P>
	<LI>Compensating for an impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments. In most mitigation agreements, more of a resource or habitat must be provided than was originally present. Ratios greater than 1:1 are required in part to compensate for unrealized losses and the inability of technology to completely restore the natural environment. (For example, if a developer wants to build a planned community in Houston that will destroy 100 acres of wetlands, the developer can propose to create 400 acres of wetlands in a nearby site.)
</OL>
<P>
Except for the avoidance option, most mitigation efforts assume that some loss of natural resources is permissible. Options two, three and four above assume a level of human expertise in designing natural environments and/or funding that in some situations can be unrealistic. Option five suffers from the same risk. Replacement activities, such as creating a wetland, assume that man-made environments are equal to natural ones and can serve the same valuable functions. There is still much dispute among scientists about whether this is actually the case. No one really knows how to mimick natural systems. This is particularly true with respect to complex systems such as wetlands. A five-year study conducted in Oregon to see how restored and created wetlands measured up to natural ones found that the initial designs were inadequate, that the designs outlined in the permit were not adhered to and that overall the wetland projects were "fundamentally different" from the wetlands they were supposed to replace.<A HREF="#6">(6)</A> On the other hand, compensation may indeed be a viable option for mitigation activities that involve less complex ecosystem decisions.

<HEAD><TITLE>FOCUS: Texas "Takings" Legislation</TITLE></HEAD>

<BR><H2>Texas "Takings" Legislation</H2></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="line.gif" ALT="Line" WIDTH="100%"></CENTER><BR>

During the 74th Texas legislative session, what has become known as the "takings" bill was passed.<A HREF="#1">(1)</A> This legislation subjects a huge range of government actions to legal challenges from private property owners. The law allows  property owners to bring a variety of legal actions to halt or invalidate government actions claimed to cause a "taking," which is defined as 25% or greater reduction in property value. If the government wants to carry out actions that result in a taking, as defined by the terms of this law, it will have to first pay compensation to landowners who challenge the action.
<P>
The term takings is derived from the 5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which in part reads, "... nor shall private property be taken for public use without due compensation."
<P>
This law does not just apply to environmental regulations; a broad spectrum of government jurisdiction, on the state and local levels, will be affected. The Texas Farm Bureau and other agricultural and rural landowner organizations were the driving force behind the Texas takings bill. Supported by extractive industries, such as mining, timber, agriculture, oil and gas, takings legislation has also been introduced at the national level and in many western states. Much of the takings legislation being proposed or passed at the national and state levels is an attempt to thwart the intent of the Endangered Species Act and other major environmental and conservation legislation. The Texas legislation, however, cannot be applied to the Endangered Species Act or other federal environmental laws. 
<P>
The Texas takings legislation only affects the actions of <I>state </I>and <I>local </I>governmental entities (including institutions of higher education, school districts, municipal utility districts and river authorities). It has two main components: (1) allowing landowners to sue for compensation or to stop or invalidate government action that results in a taking, as defined by the legislation and (2) requiring that "takings impact assessments" be performed by government entitities before they take action, with an option for landowners to sue to stop the action if the governmental entity does not prepare the impact assessment.

<P>
This focus discusses the environmental impact of pesticide use in agricultural and urban settings. It does not explore the economic pros and cons of using pesticides, which is beyond the scope of the <I>Texas Environmental Almanac</I>.
<H4>
<A NAME="SHORT">A SHORT</A> HISTORY OF PESTICIDE USE
</H4>
<p>
Widespread use of synthetic pesticides in the United States began following World War II. The ingredients for many of today's pesticides were, in fact, created as weapons of war.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#1">(1)</A> Before the development of synthetic pesticides, farmers used naturally-occurring substances such as arsenic and pyrethrum.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#2">(2)</A> Pesticide use was credited with increasing crop yields by reducing natural threats to production and became an integral part of agricultural practices by the mid-1950s. During the past five decades, American agriculture has dispersed 30 billion pounds of pesticides into the environment.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#3">(3)</A> Also, beginning in the late 1940s, federal and local governments sponsored the widespread spraying of DDT and other chemicals in urban communities in an effort to eradicate mosquitoes, fire ants, gypsy moths, the Japanese beetle and other insects judged to be harmful. 
<p>
Every year in the United States, 1.1 billion pounds of active pesticide ingredients are released into the environment; 834 million pounds (77 percent) are used in agriculture, the remainder for non-agricultural purposes. If the use of wood preservatives, disinfectants and sulfur is included, the annual amount of pesticide usage increases to 2.2 billion pounds of active ingredients.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#4">(4)</A> Altogether, U.S. pesticide usage equals more than four pounds per person annually.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#5">(5)</A> In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that in 1991, U.S. manufacturers exported 390 million pounds of pesticides.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#6">(6)</A>
<p>
Following World War II, pesticides were a component of what was predicted to be a "green revolution" of abundant food for the world. During the past fifty years, agricultural production in many areas of the world has increased dramatically, partly because of the use of herbicides and insecticides. Health benefits, such as those related to eradication of malaria-carrying mosquitoes, were also foreseen and, in many cases, attained.
<p>
In May 1962, biologist Rachel Carson alerted the public to the side effects of pesticide use in her book, <I>Silent Spring</I>. Questions were raised about the actual (rather than the perceived) benefits of pesticides, along with questions about environmental and public health risks.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#7">(7)</A>
<p>
The "pathways" of human exposure to pesticides, which include insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides and fungicides, are numerous. Pesticide residues are found virtually everywhere: in the office and home, on food, in drinking water and the air.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#8">(8)</A> 
<p>
Throughout almost 50 years of pesticide use, most pesticides have never been systematically reviewed for their full range of long-term health effects on humans, such as potential damage to nervous, endocrine or immune systems. The Environmental Protection Agency considers only cancer in determining the potential threat of pesticides to human health. Until recently, cancer has been considered the most sensitive end point - if you could prevent cancer, you could prevent other chronic diseases. Furthermore, scientists have been able to develop the model by which they can extrapolate cancer data from animal studies. The concept that cancer is the most sensitive end point is now being seriously questioned. Though not documented, estrogenic changes might be another sensitive end point.
<p>
The effects of pesticides on wildlife are also not well-documented. It wasn't until 1985 that the EPA reviewed an insecticide solely on the basis of its effects on wildlife.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#9">(9)</A> Since then, the EPA has canceled some pesticides, based partially on their effects on the environment and wildlife.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#10">(10)</A> Discoveries of pesticide residues have also resulted in fishing bans in bays, lakes and rivers. 
<p>
Agricultural pesticides have prevented pest damage at between 5 percent and 30 percent of "potential production in many cropping situations."<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#11">(11)</A> Pesticides, however, have posed a number of problems for agriculture, including the killing of beneficial insects, secondary pest outbreaks and the development of pesticide-resistant pests.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#12">(12)</A> Several studies show a decrease in the effectiveness of pesticides. According to one study, 7 percent of U.S. agriculture production was lost to pests in the 1950s; in 1993, 13 percent of all production was lost to pests.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#13">(13)</A> A different study concluded that crop losses from pests increased from 31 percent in 1945 to 37 percent in 1990 while during that same period farmers used 33 times more pesticides.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#14">(14)</A> 
<p>
Today, 440 species of insects and mites and more than 70 fungi are now resistant to some pesticides.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#15">(15)</A> As a result, it has become necessary to use larger doses and more frequent applications of pesticides. Combining pesticides, or substituting more expensive, toxic or ecologically hazardous pesticides occurs more frequently. In addition to the problem of pesticide resistance, millions of dollars worth of crops have been lost as a result of improper pesticides application.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#16">(16)</A>

<A NAME="NEW">NEW </A>DISCOVERIES ABOUT PESTICIDES
</H4>
<p>
Although pesticides do offer certain benefits for farmers and other users, new scientific research is uncovering some important health-related issues associated with their use. Recently, for example, some scientists have become convinced that there is a relationship between pesticides that mimic the estrogen hormone and the disruption of the endocrine system in humans and wildlife. This potentially could contribute to serious health problems, including breast and other types of cancer in humans, and reproductive disorders.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#17">(17)</A> Currently, in registering pesticides, the EPA does not require tests for estrogenicity, and if a pesticide were found to be estrogenic, the EPA would have no method of removing it from the market. 
<p>
Estrogenic pesticides include:
<p>
<UL>
	<LI>the herbicides alachlor and atrazine (the two most widely used pesticides by volume) used on 15 different crops;<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#18">(18)</A>
	<p>
	<LI>the fungicides EBDC and benomyl, the first and fifth most commonly used fungicides; 
	<p>
	<LI>insecticides including carbaryl, dicofol, endosulfan, methomyl, methoxychlor, parathion and the synthetic pyrethroids.
</UL>
<p>
Though there is no conclusive evidence to date, in the last few years several studies have indicated that chemicals which mimic the female hormone estrogen might cause reproductive problems in animals. For example, one study has reported that male alligators exposed to pesticides in Florida are having difficulty reproducing, partly because their penises are not developing to normal size. This reproductive interference could be related to exposure to estrogenic pesticides. It also has been reported that some birds, fish, amphibians, and mammals are being "feminized" by exposure to low levels of pesticides and other industrial chemicals.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#19">(19)</A>

<A NAME="FED">FEDERAL</A> PESTICIDE REGULATION 
</H4>
<p>
In 1947, Congress took its first step to regulate pesticides with the enactment of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). This early law was intended primarily to protect farmers and others from mislabeled, ineffective or adulterated pesticides. That original document was only 35 pages long. By 1994, with billions of dollars on the line and as questions of possible adverse health effects and environmental impacts had been raised, FIFRA has expanded to more than 200 pages.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#20">(20)</A> FIFRA initially granted jurisdiction over pesticides to the United States Department of Agriculture, but in 1970, amid reports of the USDA's mismanagement and conflicts of interest, Congress shifted authority for pesticide regulation to the newly-created Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#21">(21)</A> The USDA, however, continues to play a role: it is responsible for monitoring pesticide residues and it continues to promote the use of pesticides. 
<p>
Key provisions of the current version of FIFRA include the following:<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#22">(22)</A>
<p>
<OL>
	<LI>The EPA is responsible for setting most standards for pesticide use. States handle enforcement. The EPA has the authority to prohibit the use of a pesticide in the United States, to restrict uses and to set the level of pesticide residues allowed on raw food. 
	<p>
	<LI>Manufacturers of a chemical that is to be used to kill any "pest" must obtain a registration for that product from EPA. If the pesticide is considered too dangerous to be used by the general population, EPA may register the pesticide as "restricted use," which means it may be applied only by certified applicators or under the supervision of a certified applicator. 
	<p>
	<LI>In order to obtain a registration, the pesticide manufacturer must provide the EPA with studies designed to ascertain the probable adverse effects of the pesticide on humans. (The series of tests for a typical pesticide can cost the manufacturer $5 million-$6 million.<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#24">(24)</A>)
	<p>
	<LI>The manufacturer must demonstrate that the pesticide "will perform its intended function without unreasonable adverse affects on public health or the environment," which is defined as "any unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social and environmental costs and benefits of the use of any pesticide."<A HREF="PESTNOTES.HTML#25">(25)</A> 
	<p>
	<LI>Pesticides cannot be registered for use on food crops or animal feed until EPA has determined residue tolerance levels - maximum allowable residues of chemicals. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act provides authority for setting and monitoring tolerance levels. The Food and Drug Administration monitors residues and the EPA sets tolerance levels. In requesting tolerance levels, the manufacturer must provide the EPA with health data. These are usually drawn from animal studies conducted by the manufacturer.

<H4>
STATE OF TEXAS INITIATES COMPARATIVE RISK PROJECT
</H4>
<P>
The state of Texas, along with various other states and municipalities in the nation, has begun a comparative risk project to identify and prioritize the hazards posed to the state's environment, economy and public health. The purpose of the State of Texas Environmental Priorities Project (STEPP) is to initiate this process in order to help the state better allocate its limited resources to address the state's environmental and public health problems. Input is being sought from industry groups, environmental organizations, municipal governments, the scientific community and the general public.
<P>
The impetus for this effort by the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC) was the Environmental Protection Agency's Comparative Risk Project conducted for Region VI.<A HREF="#1">(1)</A> According to a 1990 EPA report, less than 10 percent of the federal environmental budget is spent on high-risk environmental problems, such as pesticides, indoor air pollution and contaminated drinking water.<A HREF="#2">(2)</A> STEPP's purpose is to ensure that the state's resources and federal funds are utilized to address the greatest risks for all Texans.
<P>
The STEPP program has two parts: risk assessment and risk management. The first phase will identify the hazards and analyze the issues of most concern to Texas residents through the project's eight advisory committees, focus groups and meetings throughout the state. The second phase, risk management, will attempt to develop solutions to reduce the risks identified as priorities by factoring in elements such as political will, legal constraints and economic cost.<A HREF="#3">(3)</A> 
<P>
Congress, municipal and state government officials and industry groups have endorsed this type of approach, saying it is a sound method that provides a scientific foundation from which fiscally responsible decisions can be made to reduce environmental and public health risks. On the other hand, the risk assessment methodology has its critics.<A HREF="#4">(4)</A>
<P>
The TNRCC's STEPP program seeks to balance the concern for quantifiable scientific data with the consideration of public values, economic and political interests and the capacities of regulatory agencies. Furthermore, just as the EPA's regional comparative risk analysis led to this state study, it is anticipated that STEPP will lead to local studies which will provide cities, counties and local plan-ning agencies more tools to make decisions at the local level. For example, STEPP is supporting, through technical assistance, the City of Houston's project called "Houston Environmental Foresight." The ultimate success of these initiatives will be reflected in the measures taken to truly safeguard the health, environment and quality of life of all Texans for future generations.

<br><H2>Military Toxic Sites in Texas</H2></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="line.gif" ALT="Line" WIDTH="100%"></CENTER><BR>


With the end of the Cold War, the nation and the state of Texas are grappling with the legacy of environmental contamination at military installations, which use large amount of hazardous materials and contain numerous polluted sites. 
<P>
In the early 1980s, the Department of Defense (DOD) began the Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP) with the objective of cleaning up the contaminated sites at these bases. During that period, a similar program was also initiated by the Department of Energy. A 1994 Department of Defense report indicates that there are 19,694 potentially contaminated sites at 1,722 Department of Defense installations in the United States.<A HREF="#1">(1)</A> These installations and sites, which are included in the Defense Environmental Restoration Program, follow the regulations set by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). (See <I>Waste </I>section for discussion of SARA and CERCLA.) Ninety-four of these installations are listed on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Priorities List (NPL) for cleanup due to the severity of the public health and environmental hazards posed by these sites.<A HREF="#2">(2)</A> 
<P>
The allocated budget for the cleanup of these installations for fiscal year 1994 is approximately $2 billion;<A HREF="#3">(3)</A> the ultimate cost for cleanup has been projected to reach $100 to $200 billion.<A HREF="#4">(4)</A> This amount covers cleanup only at domestic installations; cleanup costs at foreign Department of Defense bases and Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear weapons plants are not included. At Department of Energy facilities, the estimated costs of cleanup of the contamination of radioactive and hazardous materials exceeds $200 billion.<A HREF="#5">(5)</A> 
<P>
Because of the national political clout of Texas politicians such as President Lyndon Baines Johnson and Speaker of the House Jim Wright, for more than 50 years Texas garnered a large share of military bases and defense-related contracts. However, as a result of a reduction in federal expenditures, the state of Texas is now faced with addressing the effects of defense downsizing, which includes overseeing the cleanup of contamination at military facilities.<A HREF="#6">(6)</A> 
<P>
There are 88 Department of Defense installations under the Defense Environmental Restoration Program in Texas. Of the 24 classified as "major" installations, four are undergoing closure or realignment. According to the Department of Defense, there are 1,010 potentially contaminated sites at military installations in Texas.<A HREF="#7">(7)</A> Furthermore, there are 61 sites at 25 Formerly Used Defense Sites, or FUDS, in Texas.<A HREF="#8">(8)</A> FUDS are defined as "...real property that formerly was owned by, leased to, used by, or otherwise under operational control of Department of Defense."<A HREF="#9">(9)</A> The Defense Environmental Cleanup Program 1994 annual report lists for the first time the number and status of cleanup at FUDS.
<P>
Environmental hazards are related to the operations taking place at each installation. For example, the primary mission of the Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant in Bowie County is to load, assemble and pack ammunition items. The solid waste generated at this installation thus includes contaminants from explosive residues, toxic metals and organic chemicals.<A HREF="#10">(10)</A> The Naval Air Station in Kleberg County serves as a naval training facility and provides aviation services. Waste generated from the maintenance of aircraft at this site include chlorinated waste solvents, waste oils, lead acid batteries and PCB contaminated materials.<A HREF="#11">(11)</A> At Kelly Air Force Base in Bexar County, the environmental contamination is due to the maintenance and repair of military aircraft, leaks and spills from the fuel distribution and storage systems and operation of the industrial wastewater treatment system. An initial study of Kelly found both on-site and off-site groundwater to be contaminated by heavy metals and organic chemicals including halogenated and nonhalogenated solvents, JP-4 jet fuel, oil, PCBs and pesticides.<A HREF="#12">(12)</A>
<P>
Past disposal practices at many military bases included discharging contaminated wastewater to unlined settling pits, burying waste in landfills and burning waste in fire training exercises. In 1989, Kelly Air Force Base was issued a Texas Water Commission order for "violations of state solid waste regulations including failure to close a RCRA regulated unit with an approved closure plan, failure to comply with 90 day accumulation time requirements, failure to install an adequate RCRA groundwater system and for managing its solid waste in such a manner as to result in the discharge of solid waste to State waters."<A HREF="#13">(13)</A>
<P>
The extent of contamination at federal facilities in Texas has led to the inclusion of some of these installations on the EPA's National Priority List (the Superfund list). Contaminated sites are on the National Priority List because they pose serious environmental or health risks, as measured by the EPA's Hazard Ranking System (HRS). Currently, three Texas Department of Defense installations and one Department of Energy facility are on the Superfund list. The Department of Defense facilities are the Air Force Plant #4 (General Dynamics) in Tarrant County, the Lone Star Ammunition Plant in Bowie County and the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant in Harrison County. The Department of Energy facility is the Panhandle's Pantex Plant in Carson County.
<P>
In June 1994, the Pantex Plant became the most recent federal facility to be included on the Superfund list. Beginning in the early 1950s, the installation's principal mission was the assembly of nuclear weapons, which utilized large quantities of uranium, plutonium and tritium, as well as other non-radioactive but hazardous chemicals.<A HREF="#14">(14)</A> Past and present waste practices at Pantex include burial of waste in unlined fillers, discharging plant wastewater into on-site surface waters and burning of chemical waste in unlined pits.<A HREF="#15">(15)</A> Depleted uranium has been found in soil near Pantex firing sites.<A HREF="#16">(16)</A> Furthermore, solvents, gasoline components and high-explosive contamination have been found in the area above the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underground water reservoir that spans six states.<A HREF="#17">(17)</A>
<P>
The estimated cost of cleanup for the Department of Defense sites in Texas is $600 million.<A HREF="#18">(18)</A> Under a cooperative agreement with the Department of Defense, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission received about $1.4 million to oversee the cleanup of active sites at these installations for fiscal year 1994.<A HREF="#19">(19)</A> In fiscal year 1994, the most current year for which data is available, there were 721 sites at Department of Defense facilities at which studies had been completed, 44 sites at which cleanup was underway and 57 sites at which cleanup was completed.<A HREF="#20">(20)</A>
<P>
The legacy of environmental contamination at military installations presents a major challenge to the Department of Defense and environmental regulators. Though a more open and environmentally-sound approach is being adopted by the Pentagon, the allocation of appropriate resources is needed to guarantee proper cleanup, restoration and compliance. Continued monitoring by citizens groups is also needed to assure that pollution prevention and conservation measures are adopted and the environmental and public health threats of existing military toxic sites are properly abated.

Getting environmental information from Texas' natural resource environmental agencies has never been easier. Information ranging from air emissions of sulfur dioxide to camping sites at state parks is available to anyone with a computer and a modem. Bulletin board systems (BBS) set up by the agencies allow the public to transfer ("download") files from an agency's databases to their own computer, view information about the agency (such as overviews of program areas or upcoming meetings), and send electronic messages back and forth. The Texas State Comptroller of Public Accounts maintains a BBS called Window on State Government, which allows access to all state agency BBS systems. To access one of these systems, a customer must have a modem, the appropriate software and a telephone line. Some state agencies have put information servers on the Internet, the global computer network. The lead Internet site is called "State of Texas - Government Information," which can direct users to Internet sites operated by other state agencies, as well as by universities and state agencies. See the attached list. 
<P>
Not all information comes over the computer. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has a new information retrievel service known simply by its telephone number: (512) 239-DATA.<A HREF="#1">(1)</A> Using this number, TNRCC employees and any interested outside party can request information, automated reports contained within the TNRCC computer databases, or request that the TNRCC create a new report. The information is free to local, regional and state governments, news media, Texas educational institutions, legislators and not-for-profit organizations. Private interests, on the other hand, will be charged according to the time, printing service costs and mailing costs.<A HREF="#2">(2)</A> 
<P>
The Texas Natural Resources Information Service provides a clearinghouse and referral center for natural resources data. A unit of the Texas Water Development Board, TNRIS receives and collects information from dozens of state agencies. It maintains a library of data, including aerial photography and satellite imagery, U.S. Geological Survey maps, and computerized files on water resources, geology and census data. In addition, TNRIS operates a Geographic Information System, which combines data with mapping information. TNRIS also runs the Texas/Mexico Borderlands Data and Information Center, with special information on the border region. Both TNRIS and the Borderlands Data and Information Center can be accessed by computer or reached at (512) 463-8402.

<BR><H2>TRI: A Powerful Citizen's Tool</H2></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="line.gif" ALT="Line" WIDTH="100%"></CENTER><BR>


The Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) has proven to be one of the most effective tools for citizen groups and environmental advocates to decipher potential environmental and public-health hazards in their backyards. Though certain limitations exist, TRI data are relatively easy to access and can be used to analyze chemical releases in a facility, a zip code area, a city, a state or the country as a whole. 
<P>
The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) was established under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986. This legislation, which was supported by a wide array of labor, community and environmental organizations, gave citizens for the first time the "right-to-know" about hazardous chemicals in their communities. SARA Title III was a product of the widespread concern over chemical hazards that arose after the Union Carbide chemical release in Bhopal, India, which killed 2,500 people and injured hundreds of thousands in December 1984.
<P>
Under the Community Right-To-Know pro-gram, TRI requirements currently apply only to manufacturing facilities with 10 or more employees that use more than "threshold" amounts of any of 300 individual chemicals and 20 chemical categories which may be toxic to humans, animals, plants, aquatic life or the environment.<A HREF="#1">(1)</A> Efforts are underway to expand the chemicals and facilities that are required to report to TRI. For example, federal facilities began to report in 1994. In 1995 the EPA expanded the list of reportable chemicals to more than 650 chemicals and chemical categories. Manufacturers must report using the expanded list in 1996.
<P>
TRI data can provide initial information on the toxic chemicals that are released to air, water, land, underground injection or transported to off-site facilities for treatment and disposal, recycling and burning for energy recovery. These emission reports are made to state environmental regulatory agencies, such as the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) and to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This information is then made available to the general public. 
<P>
According to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, TRI data is the best source to track pollution prevention progress; to identify pollution prevention opportunities; to improve emergency response planning; to aid employees in identifying potential risks; and to encourage community awareness of potential hazards in the environment.
<P>
Citizens can use the information to find out what chemicals are being released in their communities and neighborhoods, in what quantities, by whom and where the chemicals are going. This information can in turn be used as a basis of dialogue between residents and a particular manufacturing company on ways to reduce emissions and potential hazards.
<P>
In Austin, for example, an environmental justice organization has used TRI data to map sources of emissions in neighborhoods comprised primarily of people of color.<A HREF="#2">(2)</A> In Northfield, Minnesota, a labor union and community leaders used toxics release inventory data to negotiate the reduction, and ultimate elimination, of a probable carcinogen emitted by a local company.<A HREF="#3">(3)</A> And, in Puerto Rico, an environmental research organization has published a ranking of various facilities throughout the island based on the total pounds of chemicals released as well as the health effects of the chemicals emitted in the greatest amount.<A HREF="#4">(4)</A> The organization distributed the findings in their newsletter as a means to inform the public about the community right-to-know law.<A HREF="#5">(5)</A> 
<P>
TRI data may be accessed through a telecommunications computer service, called RTK-NET, run by OMB Watch and the Unison Institute in Washington, DC. TRI data, as well as information on other federal environmental programs, can be obtained through RTK-NET's databases using a personal computer with a modem. TRI data can also be obtained by contacting the TRI Program at the TNRCC. For more information, contact:

<H3>Previous Environmental Links of the Week Sites</H3>

<A HREF="http://www.idworks.com/greenzone/">GreenZone</A> is a new & growing website for Texas environmental
information, with particular emphasis on the Austin/Central Texas region. You'll
find news, featured issues, and information from local and statewide
environmental organizations here. I especially liked the cool views in the Barton Springs
aquatic gallery (the shots were taken with a Koday disposable "Fun
Saver Weekend" 35mm underwater camera!).
<P>

Invite nature into your human habitat! Visit the Texas Parks & Wildlife
Department's <A HREF="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/nature/nature.htm">Nature</A>
section and look at their <B>Texas Wildscapes Program</B> for instructions on
setting up your own backyard habitat... attract butterflies, songbirds,
hummingbirds, lizards, and small mammals for your viewing pleasure. There's also great
information about native Texas plants and animals on this page... 
<P> 

Remember too that nature is often present inside our homes as our familiar animal companions: 
dogs, cats, birds, reptiles... For an excellent resource on proper care, feeding and health-related 
information check out <A HREF="http://www.acmepet.com/">Acme Pet</A>.
<P>

<A HREF="http://web-hou.iapc.net/~combs/backyard/default.html">Kinkaid's
Backyard</A> is an excellent example of bioregionalism and of education on the
Net. Students at Kinkaid, a private K-12 school in west Houston, have created a
wonderful and informative site about their biome, the Buffalo Bayou. I especially
enjoyed the great facts, photos  and presentation of the flora and fauna of the
region. 
<P>

With drought conditions worsening throughout Texas, the
<A HREF="http://h2o.usgs.gov/public/watuse/index.html">U.S. Geological Survey's
Water Use in the U.S.</A> site is a good place to learn about the complexities of water shortages, and 
includes valuable information such as questions and answers about 
home water use, fact sheets, color maps, and links to other resources on water.
<P>

<A HREF="http://agcomwww.tamu.edu/agcom/agrotext/garden.html">Texas
Agricultural Extension Service</A> offers lots of valuable information about
home gardening... planting schedules (many Texas crops can be planted NOW!), how
to compost, identifying and treating plant diseases, and more. You can even e-mail them
with questions and they'll respond! Supplement this information with organic
gardening tips from Texan Howard Garrett's <A
HREF="http://www.whitehawk.com/dirtdoctor/">Basic Organic Program</A> and you're 
on your way to having a beautiful spring, summer and fall garden harvest!
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.cfe.cornell.edu/EarthDay/ednethome.html">Earth Day Network</A> is *the* 
site for keeping up with Earth Day happenings. Listings of state-by-state activities, 
event organizers' guides, classroom curriculums, announcement area, activity ideas, downloadable files... 
(And then check out this month's <A HREF="../greenbeat/apr96/">GreenBeat!</A> coverage of Earth Day too!)
 <P>

<A HREF="http://www.envirolink.org">EnviroLink</A> has recently
completed a site redesign that can be best described as "eye candy." It's really
beautiful. And you still get all the great EnviroLink resources like daily
environmental news plus news archive, their extensive library of green links and
the green marketplace. Don't worry if you have a slow-go modem, you can still
choose a low-bandwidth option for viewing the site (but you'll miss an
eyeful).
<P>

The Spring
Equinox is this week and it's time to dust off those hiking boots and camping
gear and get outdoors! Visit the <A
HREF="http://www.hyperweb.com/wepco/index.html">Whole Earth Provision Company</A>
site for a backpacking checklist, health and safety tips, instruction on how to
use an analog watch as a compass (suggested for emergency use only), and gear
care and cleaning guidelines. <BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>

Has spring fever hit you like it's already hit me? I can't wait to start on new projects for my 
house, like putting in a rainwater irrigation system and reusing the greywater from my tubs and sinks 
to water my landscape.  
The guide by my side for doing these projects is the  
<A HREF="http://www.GREENBUILDER.com/general/BuildingSources.html">Sustainable Building Sources</A> 
site maintained by Bill Christensen and InfiNet. Here you'll find the City of Austin's excellent

This canal contains high levels of human waste and toxic chemicals.  It runs
into a larger canal which runs into the Gulf of Mexico which picks up all the
human waste and chemicals from surrounding factories.  The human waste does not
decompose because chemicals kill the bacteria in the water.<P>

 AUSTIN - Texans are fond of saying, "If you don't like the Texas
weather, just wait a minute and it will change."<P>
       
        This is a region of weather extremes. We may see
months of little or no rain followed by a deluge that turns dry creeks into
roaring rivers.  The dry and wet periods typically come in cycles.   <P>
   
        Want to know about droughts?  Just ask the Hill Country folk who
remember having to haul water by truck during an extended drought in
the 1950s.  More recently, the region has had severe droughts in 1984
and again in 1988.  In fact, records show that the area tends to go
through a dry period at least once every 10 years.<P>

        The current situation is a drought by any definition, not only for
Central Texas but statewide.  The hydrologic definition of a drought is a
period of abnormally dry weather that lasts long enough to cause a
serious water imbalance, such as crop damage or water supply
shortage.  The ranchers and farmers and rural residents whose wells
and stock ponds have gone dry will attest to the imbalance.<P>

        The meteorological definition identifies a drought as a significant
decrease in rainfall from what would normally be expected over a wide
area.  A check with the National Weather Service shows that the first
three months of 1996 were the third driest in Austin since
record-keeping began in 1885.  But Austin was not alone.  Corpus Christi
had its driest first quarter, Victoria its second driest and San Antonio its
fourth driest.<P>

        Sure there have been some teasing rains that have helped green
up the vegetation in recent weeks. Even during droughts there is rain.
How long will this drought continue?  It's impossible to say for sure. It
could be a few months or it could be years. The key is whether we will
get large amounts of rain in April and May, our wettest months.  Right
now, it does not look good.  In fact, most of the data and predictions we
are seeing point to continued drier than normal conditions at least through
the summer, and probably through the fall.<P>

        What's causing this condition?  In recent years, which have been
wetter than normal, we have seen a weather pattern known as El Nin&ntilde;o,
where the jet stream has been influenced by warm tropical waters in the
Pacific Ocean.  This time around, the weather pattern is El Ni&ntilde;o's sister,
La Ni&ntilde;a, which is characterized by colder tropical waters in the Pacific. 
With La Ni&ntilde;a, the jet stream flows generally from northwestern Canada
south to Texas, then east into Alabama and Georgia.  This pattern has
carried several cold air masses into Texas during this past winter and
has brought unusually cold and wet weather to much of the eastern U.S.
 Furthermore, the pattern has not allowed a flow of moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico to create rain across Texas.  Most computer forecasts
indicate that the La Nina pattern will continue at least through summer.  <P>

        Of course, if a hurricane hits the Texas coast this summer, it
could change everything in a hurry. And if that happens, folks probably
will be wishing for dry weather again.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>Being Water Wise with Native Plants</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><I>by Daniel Pace<BR></I>

</CENTER>


&nbsp;<BR>

<font size=+1>

Texas is ready to dry up and blow away.  To reduce the drain of lawn
maintenance,
which accounts for nearly 50% of water usage in Austin, Texas, the city's water
conservation department relies on the promotion of xeriscaping as a means to
greatly reduce the amount of water we use.<P>

Xeriscaping is a form of landscaping intended to reduce the amount of water a
yard needs in addition to regular rainfall;  it can result in an 80%
reduction in
the amount of water needed to maintain a beautiful, low maintenance yard.<P>

A primary goal of xeriscaping is the use of native plants.  Plants obviously
thrive in regions to which they are already adapted.  Growing plants in a
hostile
environment, especially one as hot and dry as Texas, requires high maintenance
and increased water consumption.  However, choosing plants which are adapted to
the area for which they are intended means more than choosing plants which are
native to Texas.  The microclimate must also be taken into consideration because
specific sites which have been altered by development will have different needs.
Plants which do well in suburban lawns may be harder to maintain in commercial
parking lots.<P>

Proper plant selection is an important step, but much more goes into
planning the
proper xeriscape.  Ensuring proper soil conditions adds much to the life
expectancy and health of your plants.  In addition to providing nutrients, good
soil retains moisture better.  Mulch is perhaps the easiest and most attractive
means for improving soil conditions.  By keeping weed growth to a minimum and
helping the soil trap water, mulch provides an aesthetically pleasing
alternative
to turf grass.  Perhaps the first step in planning a xeriscape is testing the
soil to discover ways in which it could be improved.<P>

Xeriscaping is intended to reduce, not eliminate, water use.  Irrigation still
plays an important part.  The most common forms of irrigation is through
sprinkler systems or drip irrigation.  Sprinklers typically dump a large amount
of water over a wide areas in short period of time.  This works well for large
turf areas.  Drip systems are a more efficient way to water plant beds.  They
deliver water at low pressure through bubblers or spray heads located near each
individual plant.  This gives the water time to seep through the soil slowly and
allows the plant to absorb it gradually.<P>

Irrigation efficiency can also be improved through the use of surfactants and
anti-transpirants.  Surfactants reduce the surface tension of water droplets ,
allowing the plants to absorb them easier.  Anti-transpirants are liquid latex
products sprayed on plants to reduce water loss.  Systems on timers, while
convenient, pose a threat to efficiency. Watering should only be done when
necessary, certainly not after a rain, which timers, if not carefully monitored,
can do.<P>

Xeriscaping often brings to mind dry, barren, rock gardens.  This myth must be
dispelled if we are to develop truly efficient and attractive landscapes.  With
proper planning and care, these landscapes can be pleasing to the eye,
pocketbook, and earth.  Indeed, once established as a viable alternative to
traditional water guzzling landscapes, we may realize that our old lawns
were not
so attractive to begin with.  Especially when freed from the tasks of constant
mowing and watering.<P>

<font size=+1>

<I>(Mr. Jackson is pictured here with his 7-year-old grandson Joshua. The Jackson Family 
has farmed the same acreage since 1848. Folks around here are asking, "How many
family farms can survive this drought?")</I><P>


<IMG SRC="images/daddy.jpg" ALIGN = LEFT BORDER = "1" ALT="Farmer & Grandson)" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=204>

<FONT SIZE = +1>
I've been farming for 32 years and I don't ever remember as dry a year.<P>

My grandfather would talk about the year 1909 when the cotton didn't come up
until October. They only made a quarter-bale to the acre that year. But this is
the worst I've ever seen.<P>

Three of my 14 tanks are completely dry, 5 are critical and the others
dangerously low. This week I'm going to take a backhoe to an old seep hole. I
recall a spring once bubbled in this spot during my youth. I'm going to dig down
to see if I can find some water for the cattle.<P>

By now I should have been making my second or third cutting of hay for this
year,
and I haven't even made my first. You just can't find hay right now. So much
money was wasted on fertilizing the grass, but without rain it's only grown
about
two inches high.<P>

  

The wheat crop is going to be 30-40% of normal this year. In fact, we have the
lowest wheat stalks since 1934. The corn crop is on the edge of stress (in 1896
when we had record low rainfall, corn stalks didn't even produce cobs). The milo
hasn't even come up this year. I usually make about 65 bushels of oats to the
acre... this year I'll be lucky to get 15-20 bushels an acre.<P>

If you're not in farming or into the stockmarket, you may not know that grain
prices are already at a historic high level.<P>

You can expect beef prices to fall very low. With the grain and hay crops being
so bad, ranchers can't afford the feed prices; there's not enough water in the
tanks to keep them watered either. Three years ago a cow and calf pair
would sell
for about $1100, now you're lucky to get $200.<P>

NAFTA isn't helping. Mexican cattle are being shipped over and it's driving
American rancher's prices even lower. We're getting about 15-cents per pound
right now.<P>

Did you know that about 17 people handle a cow before it hits the supermarket
meat display? It's trucked and slaughtered and processed by union butchers and
then put on a piece of styrofoam. The rancher only gets about 6% on
investment.<P>

My neighbor has a dairy. He said last year his feed cost him an average of $621
per week, last week his feed price was $1235. Milk prices are definitely
going to
rise.<P>

Within the year you can expect cereal, bread and all grain-made products to rise
too. While our food supplies and prices are managed by the government, our
reserves will soon be depleted.<P>

We Americans think we have an inalieable right to cheap food. Seventy-percent of
the world's ariable, tillable soil lies within the Mississippi Valley alone. We
spend about 20% of our disposable income on food while the rest of the world
spends 32-40%. With this drought, things may indeed change.<P>

If the drought continues for another 30-45 days, there will be widespread crop
ruin and we could be looking at famine conditions.<P>

The farm bill that the Republican's recently passed through is making a serious
condition even more serious. Loans are unavailable and many others are in
default. Acts of nature and Congress are making it one of the worst agricultural
years in history. Many family farms no doubt will be lost.<P>

Of course, this drought is an act of God. It too shall pass. In the meantime it
will shake out the inefficient producer and the unlucky producer. My father
always told me, "if you have your work done before it has to be done you can
exist." I've tried to do this in my own farm management. I think I'll make it,
but I pray for my neighbors who don't... and for rain.<P>

</BODY>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Five of ten climatic regions in Texas are currently suffering
severe droughts, according to Texas Water Development Board and National Weather
Service assessments, and a sixth Texas climatic region is on the verge.  The May
18, 1996 figures, based on the <A
HREF="http://www.twdb.state.tx.us/www/twdb/hydro/images/pdsimap.jpg">Palmer
Drought Severity Index(PDSI)</A>, clearly
show a statewide drought whose effects are being seen from one city to the next
and across the pastures and ranchlands in between.<P>

Already called the worst drought in Texas since the 1950s, this dry spell has
been the focus of a recent press conference by Texas Agriculture Commissioner
Rick Perry and one to be given by the <A
HREF="http://www.twdb.state.tx.us/www/twdb/twdb_hp.html">Texas Water Development
Board</A>. Commissioner Perry said in terms of total financial impact, this
drought is well on the way to becoming the worst natural disaster Texas has ever
seen.  Grain yields are down and although beef and pork prices are low they are
low because ranchers are selling their cattle and pigs in response to higher
grain prices.  When enough animals are sold to balance operating costs, the price
of beef and pork will rise again.  Milk prices are rising, too.  So are tomatoes,
beans, and peas in Central Texas produce markets.<P>

If rain does not come soon, Texas is facing over $6.5 billion in potential
economic losses due to poor and absent crops.  By May 21, 99 Texas counties had
been declared disaster areas and another 196 had been approved for emergency feed
assistance (after losing a least 40 percent of their overall feed production). 
Feed crops are not the only plants suffering.  Cotton production around Lubbock,
the largest cotton region in the nation, is low because rainfall is 85 percent
below normal for the year.<P>

The effects of the drought extend beyond agricultural losses.  City by city,
Texas water conservation efforts are underway, even more than usual during the
arid summer months.<P>

There are 4800 public water systems (those serving 25 people or more) in Texas,
each dictated by local drought management plans.  They range from trailer parks
to businesses to office complexes to cities.  Each has a method for addressing
the problem of drought.  Some problems of drought are more severe with smaller
systems, but all systems are stressed by drought and overuse, the later often the
result of the former as people use more water from public water systems when
nature fails to provide it.<P>

As demands for water increase, the water pressure in the distribution system
decreases.  When this happens, the distribution system is in danger of back flow
contaminants.  In more extreme situations, the system is in danger of major
equipment failure.  System failures often result in the loss of all water.  In
addition to jeopardizing water supply for general residential and commercial
uses, low water pressure in the distribution system increases the threat of fire
damage as hydrant pressures are decreased.<P>

Conservation measures seek first to prevent stress on water systems, then to
react to significant stresses that result from drought and overuse.  In Austin,
for example, between May 1 and September 30 residents are asked voluntarily to
refrain from watering their lawns more than once every five days.  Dick Peterson,
Conservation Program Coordinator for the city, said watering periodically like
this is as effective as watering every day.  Instead of giving grasses tiny
amounts of water each day, giving them about an inch every five keeps them as
well hydrated.  The plants adjust their root systems and pull soil moisture from
lower depths.<P>

Two other things Peterson suggests are watering lawns in the early
morning or late evening  (before noon and after 7 p.m.) and using effective
sprinkler systems.  Time-conscious watering minimizes the effects of wind drift
and evaporation that occur during mid-day.  Sprinkler systems set low to the
ground also maximize watering efficiency.<P>

Xeriscaping, quality landscaping that
conserves water, is a way to incorporate native and adaptive plants into
landscaping.  Such plants acclimate to their climates and do not require as much
water as do others chosen only for their beauty.  This type of landscaping is a
good preventive measure for drought as plants chosen in accord with xeriscaping
principles will do well even under mandatory water rationing.<P>

Sparing residents
the cost of new water plants is another reason to conserve water, said Peterson. 
It would cost Austinites about $150 million to build a new plant, he said, one
that really would only serve peak consumption habits.  Instead of building to
meet demand, the more conservative practice is to demand less.<P>

Water conservation
may also be rewarded by cities.  Austin offers up to $150 to residential and up
to $1000 to commercial customers who install water saving devices such as low
flush toilets and water-saving faucets.  Such measures make good sense
financially and systemically.<P>

Drought is a natural phenomenon.  It is part and
parcel of climatic systems.  It can devastate, but proper preventive measures can
lessen its impact.  Conserving water is the way to do it.

<P>
With industrialization came a paradox of progress and pollution. The engines that drive our cars and our economy also drive pollution into our atmosphere and our bodies. Health effects such as cancer, respiratory ailments and birth defects are notable results. Vegetation and animals are also affected, as are our streams and rivers. This month <B>GreenBeat!</B> examines health risks associated with air pollution and provides an indepth look at the #1 pollutant: ozone.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Earth Day Evolution</FONT>
</CENTER>

<P>
Earth Day 1970 marked the birth of the popular environmental movement .
But what is Earth Day in the year 1996? Is it an educational forum for learning
about recycling and 49 other ways to save the planet; has it become another 
community celebration of music and food and fun; is it like a family reunion,
drawing the like-minded to shared festivities and fellowship; or is it more like
a spiritual revival, reconnecting spirit to earth?  This month's
<B>GreenBeat!</B> seeks to answer these questions as the environmental movement
itself seeks its own rebirth from fragmented special-interest groups into the
mainstream of our everyday lives.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Pathways to Involvement</FONT>
</CENTER>

<P>
A recent poll by the Nature Conservancy showed that 66% of Americans are more 
concerned about the environment than they were just a few years ago. And with 
good cause... as a 5 billion+ world population puts increasing demands on our 
limited natural resources, the degredation of our water, air and soil combined 
with the effects of pollutants, pesticides, chemical additives in food, clean 
water shortages, and unsustainable development, our natural environment - and 
human health - is in increasing peril.<P>

This month <B>GreenBeat!</B> profiles pathways to personal involvement. Each of 
us can contribute to the betterment of our environment. From involvement with 
grassroots community efforts to the careers and college programs we choose, there

are increasing opportunities to actively participate in the preservation of our 
homeland, the small blue planet Earth.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Wastewater</FONT>
</CENTER>

<P>
Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink. People living along the
Texas/Mexico border live out this paradox where millions of gallons of untreated
or partially treated wastewater is discharged daily into their primary source of
drinking water, the Rio Grande River.<P>

Many may not realize it, but what goes down our drains usually ends up coming
back out our water tap. After treatment most municipal and industrial wastewaters
are discharged into rivers, lakes or the ocean.<P>

Partial or untreated sewage contains many types of disease causing agents
including bacteria, toxic metals, acids, viruses, protozoa and parasitic
worms. Our water sources, both surface and ground water  supplies, are highly vulnerable
to sewage contamination. Protecting public health means protecting water quality
and quantity - now and for our future.<P>

In this <B>GreenBeat!</B>,we introduce you to some of the problems and issues of
wastewater disposal and present the basic science, as well as some of the
innovative techniques and alternatives, of wastewater treatment.<BR>

<P>
"We can be ethical only in relation to
something we can see, feel, understand or love; something, in short, we feel a
strong attachment to." - Aldo Leopold<P>
</CENTER>

This month <B>GreenBeat!</B> focuses on bioregionalism, a perspective focused on
the landscape of our lives.  Bioregionalism is a philosophy, a socially
organizing paradigm, a classification system in environmental science, and a way
of viewing and living on the land that anyone can aspire to.<P>

Peruse our interviews with Austin-area bioregionalists and profiles of groups working to 
heighten local awareness.<P>

Bioregionalism makes good sense... as a means to informing and compelling people
to sustainable living, to organizing grassroots coalitons for protecting
"endeared" areas, to improving habitat and ecosystem management, and for
strengthening local communities and economies.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2>Algae bloom in Barton Creek - Austin, Texas</FONT><P>
</CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=+1>This photograph was taken of Austin's Barton Creek during a phenomenon known as
an algae bloom.  Previous rains have washed excess nutrients (lawn fertilizers,
etc.) from nearby urban developments into the stream.  These nutrients cause an
unnatural explosion of plant life which results in a depletion of the oxygen in
the water needed by fish and other aquatic life.  The potential tragedy is that
of a "fish kill," where the stream life dies in one mass extinction.<P>

Public education programs about the environmentally responsible use of lawn
fertilizers and pesticides have helped these problems but ever increasing
urbanization continues the threat.  This month's feature on water quality
monitoring programs show how student and citizen volunteer programs are helping
to gather the scientific data needed to keep these problems in check.  What is
more, the participants are learning valuable lessons in environmental science and
laying the foundation for professional careers.

<H5>Texas Environmental Almanac, Chapter 1, Water Quantity, Page 2 </H5>
<H4>
<A NAME="MANAGE">THE STATE BEGINS TO MANAGE SURFACE WATER USE</A>
</H4>
<P>
With the Irrigation Act of 1889, all streams "within the arid areas of the state" not already claimed by a landowner were declared the property of the state and therefore subject to state regulation. In essence, Texas formally adopted the principle of "prior appropriation." The foundation of the prior appropriation doctrine is the recognition and protection of senior claims to water use, or "first in time, first in right." The second principle is that water shall be put to a "beneficial" use.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#14">(14)</A> Under this system, those wishing to divert water from a stream bed could be granted a right to a similar amount in the future provided the water was used in a fashion the state deemed reasonable and beneficial.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#15">(15)</A>  
<P>
In 1913, and again in 1917, the Legislature extended the state's jurisdiction to regulate surface water use in amendments to the 1889 Act. By 1917, the state had jurisdiction over all surface water. (The 1917 Act also authorized a new Texas Board of Water Engineers, a predecessor to today's Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, to oversee state appropriation of water rights.) However, the courts upheld water rights claimed by individuals for property they owned prior to the 1889 and 1913 laws, leaving the state with 
two sometimes overlapping systems for allocating surface water rights.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#16">(16)</A> 
<P>
The flaw inherent in such a dual system, the appropriation and riparian doctrines, became apparent in the 1950s when a severe drought in the Lower Rio Grande Valley drastically reduced the volume of water in the Rio Grande River. As a result of the drought, the amount of water appropriated under surface water rights exceeded the river's supply. 
<P><P>
<A NAME="HYDROLOGICAL">*</A>
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=3 WIDTH="85%">
<TR><TH>THE HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>All water, whether captured from a stream, collected as rain or mined from below the surface, is recirculated to the atmosphere. This never-ending exchange of water from earth to atmosphere, accomplished through precipitation and evaporation, is known as the hydrological cycle. 
<P>
As water moves through the phases of the hydrological cycle, its quality may be affected. For example, as water percolates into the ground it may gather contaminants that affect the quality 
of groundwater. Rainwater likewise may collect impurities from the air, and runoff from rainfall may gather impurities from the land surface, both of which affect the quality of surface water. 
<P>
The quantity of water moving through the cycle may also change. Water used in industrial processes, for example, may become so contaminated that it cannot be treated and returned to the cycle as wastewater. Such water would therefore be permanently removed from the hydrological cycle. Thus, in the hydrological cycle, ground water, surface water and human activities all are interrelated.
</TD></TR>

<H4>
<A NAME="REGULATION">REGULATION OF SURFACE WATER RIGHTS TODAY</A>
</H4>
<P>
In 1967, the Texas Legislature passed a law known as the "Water Rights Adjudication Act." This Act consolidated all surface water rights into a unified system by transforming previously held Spanish and Mexican grants, riparian water rights, and claims into "certificates of adjudication." The Act required all riparian and unrecorded users of water to file claims with the Texas Water Commission (now the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission). Those water right claims had to be based upon actual use during the years 1963-1967. The Commission then evaluated all water right claims, including any claim filed prior to the Act. Approval of any water right by the Commission also required court approval. All rights approved by the courts are called "Certificates of Adjudication." After 1969, anyone wishing to obtain a new water right must seek a permit from the state. Today, only water claims in the upper Rio Grande near El Paso remain unadjudicated. 
<P>
Thus, today, water rights are issued with the following terms and conditions:
<OL>
	
	<LI> A maximum amount of water which may be used each year (in acre-feet);
	<P>
	<LI> A maximum diversion rate;
	<P>
	<LI> A diversion point(s);
	<P>
	<LI> A purpose of use (e.g. municipal, irrigation, mining, etc.);
	<P>
	<LI> A place of use; AND
	<P>
	<LI> Other additional restrictions, including:

<P>
<UL>&#009;(a) stream flow restriction to protect:
<UL>
<LI>&#009; existing water right holders<BR>
<LI>&#009; water quality<BR>
<LI>&#009; aquatic fish and wildlife habitat<BR>
<LI>&#009; inflows for bays and estuaries<BR>
<li>&#009; recreational uses<BR>
</UL>

	&#009;(b) habitat mitigation measures
	<BR>
	&#009;(c) water conservation measures

</UL>

</OL>
<P>
To change any of the terms or conditions of the right requires authorization from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. In its administration of water rights, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, by law, must balance requests for new rights or for amendments against statutory responsibilities to also protect water quality, instream uses and freshwater inflows to bays and estuaries.
<P>
Currently there are about 6,600 water rights. However, a small number of these - 275 - have access to most of the water. Irrigation rights make up the greatest percentage of the number of rights but account for only 13 percent of the surface water appropriated. Most of the irrigation rights are for 100 acre-feet or less.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#17">(17)</A> 
<P>
Water rights can be sold, amended, leased or transferred. In Texas, more than 90 percent of surface water has already been adjudicated and some rivers, like the Rio Grande, are actually overappropriated.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#18">(18)</A> This means that if all holders used all their water rights - particularly during dry periods - there wouldn't be any flow in the river. To encourage conservation, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission in April 1993 modified its rules to allow water rights holders to retain for future use the rights to water conserved through water use efficiency. Prior to this rule change, permit holders were in a "use it or lose it" position, which discouraged conservation.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#18">(19)</A>

<A NAME="GROUND">GROUNDWATER AND PROPERTY RIGHTS</A>
</H4>
<P>
In contrast to surface water, Texas law allows property owners an absolute "right of capture" to the groundwater under their property. Any property owner may pump as much water as needed, generally without incurring any responsibility if other property owners are affected. 
<P>
The law makes only one exception to this right of capture: when groundwater flows in a well-defined channel and thus constitutes an underground river it becomes state property, just as if it were surface water.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#20">(20)</A> In 1992, the former Texas Water Commission declared the southern Edwards Aquifer - which sits below San Antonio and is the city's only current source of water - an underground stream, and developed a management plan that included limits on pumping. However, a State District Court subsequently ruled against the legality of the Texas Water Commission decision. No other underground water source has been designated as an underground river. 
<P>
Because the state is charged with protecting groundwater quality, however, some controls have been established. In critical areas of groundwater depletion such as the Ogallala Aquifer in the High Plains and the Edwards Aquifer in the San Antonio area, the legislature has established local management authorities, which can manage groundwater withdrawals through a permitting system. The legislature can also declare an area "critical" and set up a more restrictive management structure, if either subsidence problems or the lack of water are threatening the viability of the area.
<P>
Critics of the state's groundwater laws have long argued that the right of capture, even with some controls, leads to overpumping of the state's natural resources and doesn't properly protect the water rights of others using both surface and groundwater. However, both the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas Legislature have continued to treat groundwater as a basic property right, without consideration of third party impacts to others.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#24">(24)</A>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="INDUST">*</A>
<TABLE BORDER=3 WIDTH="85%">
<TR><TH>INDUSTRIAL WATER USE</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>Water use within the industrial sectors in Texas is projected to climb over the next 30 years, as it has in the recent past. Between 1986 and 1990, for example, water use for manufacturing rose 15 percent, from about 1.4 million acre-feet to 1.6 million acre-feet. This increase was due primarily to the resurgence of the petro-chemical industry.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#21">(21)</A> In 1990, five industrial sectors accounted for more than 90 percent of the industrial sector's use of 1.6 million acre-feet of surface water and groundwater. These five sectors are: chemical and allied products, petro-chemical products, pulp and paper products, primary metals and food. In fact, just 20 companies accounted for more than half the water used in manufacturing in 1990.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#22">(22)</A> 
<P>
At the same time, however, the use of water conservation practices has increased within Texas' industrial sector since the early 1980s. For example, the use of saline water or treated wastewater in cooling processes, or the substitution of electric heat for steam or hot water could potentially save industries and the state water. Industries that use a large amount of process water, such as the paper and pulp and the semiconductor industries - have enormous potential to reduce their water use.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#23">(23)</A>

</TABLE>
<P>
<A NAME="RESIDENTIAL">*</A>
<TABLE BORDER=3 WIDTH="85%">
<TR><TH>RESIDENTIAL WATER USE</TH></TR><TR><TD>
Municipal water use in Texas towns and cities averages 167 gallons per day per person. Of this total, a significant portion is lost in transmission and distribution. A recent study by the Texas Water Development Board found that Texas water utilities cannot account for 15 to 20 percent of the water they treat and distribute.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#26">(26)</A> Most of this loss is due to leaky distribution systems.
<P>
About a quarter of all municipal water use is due to the water used on landscapes during the spring and summer.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#27">(27)</A>
<P>
In the typical home, about 50 percent of all water is used in the bathroom. Similarly, in schools and public buildings, toilet flushing is the predominant water use.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#28">(28)</A> In 1991, the Texas Legislature passed a law requiring that - for all new fixtures - only water-conserving plumbing fixtures such as 1.6-gallons-per-flush toilets and 2.75-gallons-per-minute shower heads be used in Texas beginning in 1992.<A HREF="notes1.html#29">(29)</A> The Texas Water Development Board estimates that if all homes and public buildings used these new water-efficient toilets, which use 1.6 gallons of water per flush instead of the more conventional 3.5 to 8 gallons, Texas would save about 200 million gallons of water each day. This could reduce the need to build additional water and wastewater treatment plants by 15 percent, saving some $3.5 billion dollars over the next 50 years.<A HREF="notes1.html#30">(30)</A> The TWDB also estimates that the average family of four could save $627 annually by installing water-efficient fixtures.<A HREF="notes1.html#31">(31)</A>

<A NAME="PLANNING">WATER USE PLANNING IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
In Texas, continued availability of water is threatened by overuse of groundwater and surface water, by future development, and by the competing interests of agricultural, municipal and industrial users. Added to these human needs are the needs of the environment. Preservation of fish and wildlife habitat, support of aquatic life in rivers and streams and the need for an inflow of fresh water into the state's vast network of bays and estuaries all demand significant amounts of surface water. 
<P>
For these reasons, a variety of water districts and authorities as well as several state agencies have been involved in state water use planning in Texas. At the state government level, Texas has moved from three state agencies which dealt with water issues in 1957, to a single agency in the late 1970s, to the current structure of two state agencies, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and the Texas Water Development Board.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#25">(25)</A>
<P>
The Texas Water Development Board is charged with developing a state water plan - a new one is required at least once every six years - to ensure that "sufficient water will be available at a reasonable cost to further the economic development of the entire state."<A HREF="notes1.html#32">(32)</A> The first was developed in 1967. This plan, called <I>Water for Texas</I>, is updated every two years and estimates the supply and demands for water for the next generation and projects future facility needs. In order to meet these needs, the Texas Water Development Board also administers state and federal funds to build water supply and wastewater treatment facilities. 
<P>
The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, on the other hand, issues water rights permits and attempts to balance economic and environmental needs by considering the effects of consumptive water use on various in-stream and estuarine habitats and measuring water quality for human consumption. Also, by law, the Commission maintains the state's Water Quality Management Plan. 
<P>
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department participates in this permit process by automatically reviewing water rights permits and recommending whatever changes in permits it deems necessary to protect aquatic habitat and wildlife, be it natural areas such as state parks or wetlands, endangered and threatened species, the aquatic ecosystems of streams or the estuaries. If the agency's concerns are not met, it may request that the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission hold a public hearing on the water right application.

<A NAME="TRENDS">TRENDS IN WATER USE</A>
</H4>
<P>
Between 1930 and 1980, statewide water use increased more than five-fold, from 3 million to about 18 million acre-feet per year. Over the same period, the population more than doubled, growing from 5.8 million to 14.2 million.<A HREF="notes1.html#34">(34)</A> Between 1980 and 1990, however, statewide water use actually declined, largely because the number of irrigated acres declined and more efficient irrigation practices were adopted. With the exception of irrigation, which is expected to continue declining, all of the major use categories are likely to increase, according to the 1990 <I>Water for Texas </I>plan.<A HREF="notes1.html#35">(35)</A>
<P>
Water use by Texas cities is expected to nearly match irrigation use as the major consumer of water by 2040. The use of water for irrigation reached its peak in the early 1980s. Since then both the number of irrigated acres and the amount of water used per acre have declined rapidly and will likely continue to do so. 
<P>
Of the nearly 16 million acre-feet of water Texas consumed in 1990, groundwater supplied about 8.9 million acre-feet, or about 56 percent, and surface water provided the remaining 6.9 million acre-feet, or 44 percent.39 Almost 95 percent of the groundwater came from nine major aquifers; the remaining five percent was drawn from 20 minor aquifers.<A HREF="notes1.html#40">(40)</A> 
<P>
The consumption pattern for water pumped from the ground is different than the pattern for water taken from rivers and reservoirs. In 1990, some 79 percent of groundwater was consumed by irrigation and only 16 percent was used by municipalities.<A HREF="notes1.html#41">(41)</A> For surface water, municipalities used 26 percent and irrigation used up 46 percent. Industry relies mainly on surface water for its water needs, making up 16 percent of total surface water use in 1990.<A HREF="notes1.html#42">(42)</A> 
<P>
The share of water demands met by groundwater and surface water has changed over time. Groundwater use has dropped from 70 percent of all water used in 1974 to 55 percent in 1991. In absolute terms, the state's consumption of groundwater has gone from more than 12 million acre-feet to about nine million acre-feet in 11 years. Reliance on groundwater should continue to decline for two reasons. First, the decline of agricultural acreage overall has reduced the number of irrigated acres in the state, and the acres dropped were almost all irrigated by groundwater. Second, many of the large metropolitan areas are converting to surface water or mixing groundwater with surface water.<A HREF="notes1.html#43">(43)</A> For example, Houston is gradually switching from underground sources because of subsidence problems, while El Paso is switching because of the increasing elevated salinity - and declining quality - of its groundwater resources. Though this trend is expected to continue, groundwater will nevertheless continue to supply most of the water for large, arid areas of the state.<A HREF="notes1.html#44">(44)</A>

The demand shown from 2000 to 2040 is the Texas Water Development Board's high-case scenario with conservation -  more efficient use of water - which assumes relatively high economic and population growth, phased-in conservation for municipal water use reaching 15 percent savings by 2020 and better water use efficiency for both agricultural and industrial production.<br>

<TR><TH>THE "MINING" OF AQUIFERS</TH></TR><TR><TD>
The term "mining," when used in connection with an aquifer, refers to the practice of pumping more water from the aquifer than will be replaced through the natural recharge process. In some areas of Texas, mining of major aquifers has caused subsidence of the land. In other areas, mining has affected water quality by allowing the saline water that lies deep in most aquifers to encroach on the layers of water nearer the surface, which are used by humans. The aquifers most affected by mining include the Ogallala Aquifer in the High Plains; the Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer in the Cypress Creek river basin; the Trinity Aquifer in Dallas and Tarrant Counties; and the Gulf Coast Aquifer in the Houston-Galveston region and the Baytown, Freeport and San Jacinto River Basin areas. Potential saline encroachment problems and subsidence due to declining aquifer pressure are also present in the Trinity Aquifer in Hill, McLennan, Falls and Bell counties and all along the Gulf Coast Aquifer. The Edwards Aquifer has suffered saline-encroachment and subsidence problems, and several springs fed by the aquifer are drying up. Finally, mining of the Hueco Bolson near El Paso has changed groundwater flow and reduced the quality of the water as saline water from adjacent saline bearing sands encroaches upon higher quality groundwater.<A HREF="notes1.html#33">(33)</A>

<A NAME="PROJECTING">PROJECTING DEMAND FOR WATER</A>
</H4>
<P>
The current Texas state water plan, <I>Water for Texas,</I> was developed in 1990 and updated in 1992. A new plan is being developed for release in 1996. In 1990, the Texas Water Development Board projected that the state's population would grow from 17.5 million in 1990 to 35.6 million by 2040.<A HREF="notes1.html#47">(47)</A> This doubling of the population will increase municipal water needs by about 72 percent, even with significant water conservation, according to the Board. Over the same period, irrigation needs are projected to decrease by nearly 25 percent.<A HREF="notes1.html#48">(48)</A> The largest increase in demand is expected to occur in the industrial sector. Manufacturing use is projected to increase by about 120 percent, from 1.56 to 3.44 million acre-feet, by 2040.<A HREF="notes1.html#49">(49)</A>
<P>
There are some uncertainties in these demand projections. The Texas Water Development Board's most likely estimate of demand in the 1990 Water Plan assumes a high population growth and high economic development coupled with 15 percent conservation. However, in some areas conservation could probably reach much higher levels, while in those areas which have already achieved high conservation levels, such additional reductions may not be possible. Conservation may become a much greater factor in industry and municipal water use as water prices continue to rise.

<P>
<p>
The Texas Water Development Board Water Plan projections are also based on the assumption that industrial water use will rise in correspondence with increases in industrial productivity, which has not been the case historically. In fact, even though productivity increased in the 1980s, water use in manufacturing only increased by 150,000 acre-feet between 1984 and 1990. In fact, water use within industries varies considerably according to geography and use of conservation techniques, and not just according to the amount of production. For example, in the petroleum refining industry, refineries in the Corpus Christi area and West Texas use only half as much water per barrel of refined oil as do the refineries along the upper Gulf Coast from Beaumont to Houston.<A HREF="notes1.html#50">(50)</A>
<P>
A comparison of state water plans over the years illustrates how substantially projections can vary. The Texas Water Development Board's projected demands for the year 2000 are about 8 million acre-feet higher in the 1984 Water Plan than they are in the 1990 Water Plan.<A HREF="notes1.html#51">(51)</A> Two factors account for the differences in these forecasts. The 1990 plan forecast a lower amount for irrigation, based on reductions in this use during the 1980s. The 1990 plan also showed a smaller population and economic base than the 1984 plan, reflecting the economic decline of the later 1980s.<A HREF="notes1.html#52">(52)</A>

The Texas Water Development Board has been working with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to develop a "consensus" 1996 water plan based upon more carefully projected demands. In conjunction with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the Texas Water Development Board has released demand projections for the 1996 Consensus Water Plan. Two fundamental differences between demand projections in the previous water plans and the 1996 plan are: (1) the water conservation effects vary from city to city; and (2) the conservation effects are more aggressive (greater) than in previous plans. Assuming average rainfall, some conservation and the most likely population growth scenario, these projections show total demands only increasing from 15.8 million acre-feet to 16.8 million acre-feet over the 50 year period.<A HREF="notes1.html#53">(53)</A>
<P><A NAME="IRRIGATION">*</A>

<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER=3 WIDTH="85%">
<TR><TH>IRRIGATION FOR AGRICULTURE</TH></TR><TR><TD>
Irrigation accounted for 65 percent of the water used in Texas in 1990. Of this amount, 90 percent was used to irrigate cotton, wheat, grain, sorghum, corn, hay and rice.<A HREF="notes1.html#36">(36)</A> Some crops used water more intensely than others. In recent years, however, irrigation's share of total water use has declined significantly and the trend is expected to continue. From 1980 to 1990, annual water use for irrigation declined from 12.7 million acre-feet to 10.2 million acre-feet - about 20 percent. This decline is expected to continue over the next 50 years, with projected agricultural use in 2040 of between 6.5 million and 8 million acre-feet per year, depending upon conservation and projection methods.<A HREF="notes1.html#37">(37)</A> There are two reasons for both the present and the expected future decline: 1) the number of irrigated acres in production dropped 30 percent between 1975 and 1990; 2) farmers are practicing better water conservation techniques. The decline in irrigated lands is continuing. Since 1985, the Texas Water Development Board has helped promote conservation by approving nearly $1 million in grants and $10 million in loans for agricultural water conservation projects.<A HREF="notes1.html#38">(38)</A>

<TABLE BORDER=3 WIDTH="85%">
<TR><TH>PER CAPITA WATER USE BY MUNICIPALITY</TH></TR><TR><TD>
Municipal water use is the fastest growing category of water use in Texas, and is projected to meet or exceed the volumes used in every other category by 2040. Municipal water use includes water for households and businesses, restaurants and public offices, sanitation and landscaping and fire protection. Generally, the largest cities in the state use the most water, with Houston and Dallas consuming 12 percent and 9 percent of all municipal water. However, even accounting for a city's overall size, per capita use varies widely across the state, with cities like Dallas and Amarillo using significantly more water per capita than Houston or San Antonio. Average per capita municipal use was about 100 gallons per day in the 1950s and rose to a high of 182 gallons per day in 1978. Since that time, per capita use in the state has begun to decline, leveling off to an estimated 167 gallons per capita per day in 1990.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#45">(45)</A>
<P>
However, it is important to note that for planning purposes and projecting water demand, the "dry" year use average - whenever in the last 10 years the most water was used, usually in the dryest year - is used, not whatever the latest year's average is. For example, while Houston's average gallons per capita per day in 1993 was 159, for water supply purposes, the dry year figure of 189 gallons per capita per day - which occured during 1986 - is used as a base, and then adjusted for conservation. Similarly, while Austin's average gallons per capita per day is 180, the dry year gallons per capita per day used for determining future demand is 221 (occurring in 1984).
<P>
Since 1986, the Texas Water Development Board has helped promote water conservation by requiring recipients of federal and state water and wastewater loans of more than $500,000 to implement a water conservation program. To date, 165 loan recipients, including the city of Houston, have been required to adopt water conservation programs. In addition, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has recently instituted rules that require the adoption of water conservation measures as a condition of receiving a permit to use state water.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#46">(46)</A>

<A name="ESTIMATING">ESTIMATING THE SUPPLY OF WATER</A>
</H4>
<P>
Can Texas meet all of these demands? Supply projections include return flows of treated wastewater as well as new surface water supplies generated by new conveyance systems and reservoirs (see graphic). They also account for the reuse of water by both industry and individuals, which reduces demand, thereby increasing available supply. The Texas Water Development Board projects that these supplies will meet expected demand. However, the chart shows that by 2040 demand projections from the 1990 Water Plan will nearly equal supply. 
<P>
However, these projections do not take into account fully the amount of water that may be needed to maintain adequate aquatic and wildlife habitats. The 1996 Consensus Water Plan being developed is seeking to incorporate these environmental needs into the projections of supply and demand. Numbers for the projected supply of water are being developed as part of the 1996 Consensus Water Plan. 
<P>
An assumption made in the Texas Water Development Board's 1990 water plan is that the sustainable yield from groundwater and surface water is about 17 million acre-feet per year. In fact, there is considerable debate about how much water is actually available. Some environmental groups believe the supply is much higher. The Texas Committee on Natural Resources, for example, argues that the figure is closer to 25 million acre-feet in non-drought years when run-of-the-river flows are considered along with what is available in the reservoirs themselves.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#54">(54)</A> If actual demand is lower than projected, or actual supply higher, the Board's plans could overstate the need to develop new water supply facilities, such as reservoirs. 
<P>
Even though the overall supply is expected to be sufficient to meet demand statewide, there are major areas - including San Antonio, Houston, Corpus Christi, El Paso and, perhaps, Austin - where this may not be the case. See the Regional Demand and Supply section for a full discussion of each of these areas.

<TR><TH>ENVIRONMENTAL USE</TH></TR><TR><TD>
Increasingly, maintaining the natural habitats of plants and animals is recognized as a beneficial use of water. Perhaps the single biggest policy issue related to the use of water for habitat is the question of the appropriate amount of fresh water needed to maintain the state's bays and estuaries. Estuaries serve as important spawning grounds for many species of marine life. The state's 2.6 million acres of coastal habitat, which include bays, estuaries, and wetlands, are also home to a variety of migratory birds. These estuaries and their adjacent wetlands depend greatly upon the inflow of fresh water from rivers and streams. As river water winds its way down to the Gulf and is used and reused for industry, irrigation and municipalities, both its quality and quantity are altered, affecting bays and estuaries.
<P>
Estimating the amount of fresh water needed for in-stream habitat viability is problematic. There is considerable controversy, for example, about whether the federal government's in-stream flow methodology, which was developed using cold, mountainous Western rivers as models, can be applied to Texas' slow, meandering warm water streams.
<P>
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department uses a modified form of this methodology to determine in-stream flows that should be maintained in different streams to protect aquatic life and habitat. Parks and Wildlife favors the federal government's methodology, known as the Instream Flow Incremental Methodology (IFIM) in part because it is designed to protect riffle areas. Riffle areas are the highest points in the riverbed, which tend to be where rivers run fastest and where the invertebrates and other species inhabiting the river reach their highest populations. These riffle areas are favored by some species for their spawning habitat. The Texas Water Development Board, however, favors another methodology - the Microhabitat Assessment Technique - which is designed to protect the deep pools of the river.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#55">(55)</A>
<P>
Equally problematic is determining the inflow needs of bays and estuaries, since they depend upon these stream inflows. An estuary occurs where a river meets the sea and fresh and salt water mix. The estuary and its adjacent wetlands - coastal vegetative areas with inundated or saturated soils - provide important biological spawning grounds for marine life. They also furnish habitat for aquatic species and migratory fowl. 
<P>
Estuaries, bays and related aquatic habitats contribute significantly to the state's economy. They aid navigation and provide a base for recreational and commercial fishing and boating. An estimated 1 million recreational fishermen and 20,000 commercial fishermen fish Texas' coastal waters each year, for an estimated economic impact of $2.9 billion.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#56">(56)</A> In addition, preserving these wetlands and estuarine systems helps ensure water quality since they act as a natural filtering system for many pollutants.
<P>
At present, and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department - in conjunction with the Texas Water Development Board and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission - has developed estimates of the quantities of fresh water needed to protect San Antonio Bay. Estimates for Galveston Bay and Sabine Bay are expected in late 1995, and Texas Parks and Wildlife officials expect to have a methodology and estimate for Corpus Christi Bay by 1997.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#57">(57)</A>
<P>
Since 1985, all new surface water use permits and all amendments to existing use permits may contain provisions to reserve water for public purposes. Water right holders are required to limit their diversion of water from rivers and streams when stream flows are below a certain level. Before 1985, however, no such diversion was explicitly required. Thus, water rights for rivers like the Rio Grande have been fully appropriated without reserving any water for environmental and public purposes. Since 1986, the state has required new reservoirs that are within 200 miles of the coast to dedicate at least 5 per-cent of their firm yield for in-stream needs of aquatic habitat and the inflow needs of the bays and estuaries. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department may help determine the appropriate amount. Proposals to construct reservoirs or dam rivers require both a state and federal permit, and the federal permit process also requires applicants to consider effects upon streamflow and habitat.

<P>


Assuring a safe, adequate supply of water for irrigation, for industrial and municipal needs and for the environmental needs of individual rivers, bays and estuaries is largely a regional question. Most projections show that Texas has enough water in the state as a whole, but each region in the state has different water resources, has differing needs and faces different problems. This section looks at eight major regions in Texas, and highlights the expected demands, supplies and problems in each of them.
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="FYI.GIF">  The longest river in Texas? The Rio Grande, which begins in Colorado and covers 1,896 miles, second only to the Missouri-Mississippi.
	<P>
	The second longest? The Red River, which forms the border between Texas and Oklahoma.
	<P>
	The shortest river? The Comal, only two-and-a-half miles long.
	<P>
	What's the biggest aquifer? The Ogallala Aquifer, which covers four states, and in 1974 had more than 281.7 million acre-feet of recoverable groundwater. By 2031, this total will have been reduced to 76.1 million acre-feet in Texas.

<UL>
<LI>Very limited water supply. The major aquifers in the area - the Hueco Basin and the Mesilla Basin - are shared by New Mexico, Texas and Mexico, and provide nearly all municipal and industrial needs. Groundwater from the Hueco and Mesilla are being "mined" and saline water from adjacent saline bearing sands is encroaching upon higher quality groundwater.<P> 

<LI>High salinity in the Rio Grande river due to frequent low flows and municipal and agricultural return flows.<P>

<li>Hundreds of small, unincorporated communities along the border lack adequate water supply and wastewater.<P>

<LI>Very scarce surface water supplies, mainly available for municipal needs. New supplies will be needed for some cities in the area to meet projected demand. Conveyance (mixture of groundwater and surface water) and further development of new reservoirs are the likely options.
<P>
<LI>Ogallala Aquifer is being dried up, supplying 5.5 million acre-feet of irrigation to 4.6 million acres in the South Plains area, south of the Canadian River, and 1.3 million acres in the Northern High Plains. At present consumption levels, Ogallala Aquifer will only be able to support 5.2 million acres by 2000 with conservation efforts. Of particular concern is the the South Plains area, south of the Canadian River. At present rates of consumption, only 23 percent of the present acreage in the South Plains could be supplied by the Ogallala by the year 2030.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#59">(59)</A>

<LI>High nitrate concentrations in Seymour Aquifer, caused partly by natural phenomena and partly by pollution from septic tanks, cesspools, feedlots and agriculture, preclude its use for drinking water. Water also has high fluoride content.
<P>
<LI>Water shortages during droughts in smaller cities. Larger cities may need new supplies. Natural saline water in Red and Brazos River Basins precludes full use of these waters.

<LI>The Edwards Aquifer - the sole source of water for San Antonio's one million people - is also essential to provide stream inflow to the Leona, San Pedro, San Antonio, Hueco, Comal and San Marcos Springs north of San Antonio, as well as to Barton Springs in the Austin area. Continued use of the Edwards Aquifer is threatening these streams' ecosystems, curtailing the recreational opportunities they have long afforded. The Sierra Club, a national environmental group, is currently suing the city of San Antonio in federal district court to limit pumpage to protect Comal and San Marcos Springs, which are home to several endangered species. The judge ordered the city to prepare an emergency withdrawal reduction plan in 1994 to limit pumpage from the Edwards Aquifer in order to assure protection of the Texas Blind Salamander and the San Marcos Salamander, among other species. 
<P>
<LI>Overpumping of Edwards Aquifer will eventually lead to encroachment of saline water in some areas. Naturally occurring hydrogen sulfide continues to be a costly problem because it must be removed before water can be used for drinking. 
<P>
<LI>Pumping from the Carrizo Aquifer in the Winter Gardens area has lowered water levels 400 feet, causing encroachment of poor quality water into the aquifer.
<P>
<LI>The Texas Hill Country west of Austin and north of San Antonio suffer from groundwater supply problems because of declining water levels and poor water quality. For example, the communities of Fredericksburg, Johnson City, Kerrville and other cities in the area have begun using surface water to supplement their groundwater use. Groundwater tends to be high in salts and other minerals.
<P>
<li>If current water usage patterns continue, the city of Austin, which relies on surface water supplies, will face water shortages within 50 years.

Water Resource Problems:

<UL>
<LI>The pumping of the Gulf Coast Aquifer has caused subsidence, and has allowed salt water encroachment from the bays. The Harris-Galveston Coastal Subsidence District regulates the amount of groundwater removed from the Gulf Coast Aquifer in the Houston/Galveston area and is developing a conversion plan to convert areas from groundwater to surface water by 2010. The Brazos River Authority is developing the Allen's Creek Reservoir to meet new demand for surface water.
<P>
<LI>Bays and estuaries require significant amounts of inflow to protect habitats and economic survival, but inflows will decline as population grows. New reservoirs proposed for the coastal area to increase the supplies along the major river basins will impact estuary and bay habitat.
<P>
<li>Salt water intrusion during periods of low flow due to drought conditions or upstream consumption in Trinity and Neches Rivers can contaminate fresh water supply.

<LI>Surface water rights are totally appropriated and in drought periods - if water use rights are exercised - requirements cannot be met.
<P>
<LI>Groundwater is naturally high in salinity and most cannot be used for drinking water purposes in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. However, some less-saline water may be converted to drinking water through desalting processes.<P>
<LI>Bays and estuaries and other environmental needs must compete with the growing population of the region.
<P>
<LI>The Texas Water Development Board projects that the city of Corpus Christi will be unable to meet its water needs from Lake Corpus Christi and Choke Canyon Reservoir by 2010. Although the two reservoirs could provide the city an estimated 220,000 acre-feet per year, environmental releases required by the state to protect the needs of downstream habitat will reduce available supplies by 30,000 acre-feet per year. Further, recreational users want to maintain high water levels for boating purposes.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#60">(60)</A> 
<P>
<LI>Brownsville and Harlingen in Cameron County will exceed their permitted rights to surface water by 2010 and will need to purchase additional water rights, probably as agricultural land is converted to suburban use. 
<P>
<li>Many unincorporated subdivisions lacking proper water and wastewater facilities exist within the region, predominantly within Hidalgo and Cameron counties. In Hidalgo County alone, there are an estimated 130,000 residents living without proper wastewater facilities.<A HREF="NOTES1.HTML#61">(61)</A> The preponderance of improperly built septic tanks and drainage fields is affecting the quality of water in the region as a whole. As new systems are built for these residents, demand will increase for water.
