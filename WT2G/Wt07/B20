Subject: June DISCO Computer Move<BR>

<HR>
<P>
The DIS mainframe computer is scheduled to be moved
to a new location in the Baltimore, Maryland area in June 1996.
The move 

is scheduled to begin at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight
Time, on June 11, and it is scheduled to be completed by early
morning 
June 17.<BR>

<P>
This means that DISCO will not be able to take any
computer actions on June 12, 13 and 14. No security clearances
will be 

granted on these three days nor will DISCO be able
to respond to any status inquiries. If contractors have administrative


questions during these three days, such as how to
obtain copies of the SF 86, they should call (614) 692-1389 or
(614) 692-2253.
<BR>
We ask for you cooperation and understanding during
this change.<BR>

Indications of Potential Illegal Exports <BR>

<P>
Uhe U.S. Customs Service, Office of Enforcement,
solicits the assistance of private industry to provide information
relating to

any suspicious circumstances surrounding the exportation
of high technology items or services. Listed below are some of
the

possible indicators of an illegal export or diversion.
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>The customer is willing to pay cash for a high value order,
rather than use a standard method of payment, which usually
involves a letter of credit.<BR>
<LI>The customer is willing to pay well in excess of market value
for the commodities.<BR>
<LI>The purchaser is reluctant to provide information on the end-use,
or end-user, of the product.<BR>
<LI>The end-use information provided is incompatible with the
customary purpose for which the product is designed. <BR>
<LI>The final consignee is a trading company, freight forwarder,
export company, or other entity with no apparent connection to
the purchaser.<BR>

<LI>The customer appears unfamiliar with the product, its application,
support equipment, or performance. <BR>
<LI>The packaging requirements are inconsistent with the shipping
mode or destination.<BR>
<LI>The customer orders products or options that do not correspond
with their line of business.<BR>
<LI>The customer has little or no business background. <BR>
<LI>The order is placed by firms or individuals from foreign countries
other than the country of the stated end-user.<BR>
<LI>The order is being shipped via circuitous or economically
illogical routing, such as through Canada to a non-Canadian end-
user.<BR>
<LI>The customer declines the normal service, training, or installation
contracts.<BR>
<LI>The product is inappropriately or unprofessionally packaged
(e.g. odd sized/re-taped boxes, hand lettering in lieu of
printing, altered labels, or labels that cover old ones).
<BR>

<LI>The size or weight of the package does not fit the product
described.<BR>
<LI>&quot;Fragile&quot; or other special markings on the package
are inconsistent with the commodity described.

<HR>
<P>
<B>STANDARD FORM 86<BR>
</B>
<P>
1. DISCO now has the SF 86 in stock. Starting October
2, 1995, contractors ordering DD Forms 398 and 398-2 will be sent
the SF

86 instead. The new DD Form 1879 has been approved,
but it is not yet in stock. We expect it to be in stock early
November

1995.<BR>

<P>
2. Contractors cleared Top Secret who order the DD
Form 398 or SF 86 will be furnished the following letter.
<P>
**************************************************************

<P>
Dear Facility Security Officer:<BR>

<P>
The SF 86 has replaced DD Forms 398 and 398-2. The
SF 86 will be used for Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret personnel
security

clearance applications. Between now and December
31, 1995, you can use either the SF 86 or the DD Forms 398 and
398-2 for your

security clearance applications. You must use only
the SF 86 beginning on January 1, 1996. For Confidential and Secret

clearance applications, you must complete Part 1,
items A thru P, on the SF 86, and we have enclosed instructions
for the

completion of these Items. For Top Secret clearance
applications and the few Secret clearance applications which require
a Single

Scope Background Investigation (SSBI), you must complete
a DD Form 1879. A new DD Form 1879 has recently been approved,
but we

do not have any copies of it yet. We will send you
copies of the new DD Form 1879 when we receive our first shipment.
In the

meantime, you can use the current DD Form 1879 until
December 31, 1995. However, you must use only the new DD Form
1879 beginning

on January 1, 1996. <BR>

<P>
If you have any questions concerning these topics,
please call our Customer Service Branch at (614) 692-3724.
<P>
*****************************************************************

the SF 86 is a multi-purpose form to be used by industry and all
Executive

Branch departments and agencies, Part 1, Items A
thru P, requires special instructions depending on the user of
the form and its
purpose.<BR>

<P>

by the NISPOM or your User Agency, the SF 86 should be accompanied
by an
executed DD Form 1879 and Part 1 left blank.<BR>

<P>
For those investigations that require a DD Form 398-2
by the NISPOM, Part 1 should be completed by the contractor using
the

following instructions. The title of the items may

<HR>
<P>
Desk Reference Guide to
<P>
EXECUTIVE ORDER 12958
<P>
Classified National Security Information<BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Overview<BR>
</B>
<P>
As of October 14, 1995, you will be responsible for
complying with the President's Executive Order 12958, Classified
National Security Information. This Desk Reference Guide will
help you understand how this new Executive Order affects you.
<BR>

<P>
EO 12958 prescribes a uniform system for managing
the protection of national security information. It describes
two classification processes: original classification and derivative
classification. The new standard set forth in the Order is that
information will normally be classified only for 10 years. If
it is necessary to extend classification beyond 10 years, specific
action is required to obtain an extension or an exemption from
the rule.<BR>

<P>
The Order increases personal accountability for the
management of classification.<BR>

<P>
The Order also details proper procedures for marking
and safeguarding classified information and establishes new processes
for classification challenges, self inspection programs, and oversight
of special access programs. Finally, the Order adds classification
management as a critical element for evaluation during performance
reviews for employees who handle and create classified information.
<BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Purposes of the Order<BR>
</B>
<P>
Executive Order 12958 has two major purposes:<BR>

<P>
To prevent unauthorized disclosure of information.
Certain information is maintained in confidence to protect our
citizens, or democratic institutions, and our participation in
the community of nations. Protecting information vital to our
nation's security remains a priority.<BR>

<P>
To prevent over-classification of information. Our
democratic principles require that the American people be informed
of the activities of their government. Our nation's progress depends
on the free flow of information. In recent years, dramatic changes
have altered, though not eliminated, the national security threats
that we confront. These changes provide a greater opportunity
to emphasize our commitment to open government. This strengthened
commitment is articulated in the preamble and throughout the Order.
<BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Some Important Changes<BR>
</B>
<P>
To achieve its purposes, EO 12958 increases and emphasizes
personal responsibility for classification and declassification
decisions by making several significant changes. The Order:<BR>

<P>
Eliminates the &quot;OADR&quot; declassification
instruction. Classifiers may no longer use the indefinite duration
indicator, &quot;Originating Agency's Determination Required (OADR).&quot;
Specific declassification instructions -- most often a date or
event -- must be shown.<BR>

<P>
Requires more detailed document marking. Original
classifiers must be identified by name and position title, or
by a specific personal identifier, and a concise reason for classification
must be provided. In derivative classification, the source or
sources of classification will be shown, as well as declassification
instructions.<BR>

<P>
Provides stricter guidelines for initial (&quot;original&quot;)
classification. The Order requires the original classification
authority to be able to identify or describe the damage to national
security expected if the information were disclosed. It also eliminates
the previous Order's catch-all classification category: &quot;other
categories of information that are related to the national security
and that require protection against unauthorized disclosure.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
Affects performance reviews. Performance evaluations
and reviews of specified government employees must now include
classification management as a critical performance element.<BR>

<P>
Establishes a requirement for self-inspections. The
new Order calls for self-inspection programs in every agency at
least annually.<BR>

<P>
Encourages classification challenges. The Order authorizes
and encourages individuals to challenge the classification of
information if they believe the classification is improper. Procedures
for handling challenges must be established.<BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Original Classification<BR>
</B>
<P>
Original classification is the initial determination
that information requires, in the interest of national security,
protection against unauthorized disclosure. Only select senior
officials are delegated original classification authority. Original
classification authority is used only in those instances-which
should be relatively rare-when the information is not covered
by any security classification guide. The vast majority of cases
should be covered by a guide.<BR>

<P>
Put a different way, original classification is taking
a piece of information that has never been classified and making
it classified. <BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Reasons for Classifying<BR>
</B>
<P>
To be eligible for classification, information must
fall within one or more of the categories of information listed
in section 1.5 of the Order:<BR>

<P>
a. Military plans, weapons systems, or operations
<BR>

<P>
b. Foreign government information<BR>

<P>
c. Intelligence activities (including special activities),
intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology<BR>

<P>
d. Foreign relations or foreign activities of the
United States, including confidential sources<BR>

<P>
e. Scientific, technological, or economic matters
relating to the national security<BR>

<P>
f. United States Government programs for safeguarding
nuclear materials or facilities<BR>

<P>
g. Vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations,
projects or plans relating to the national security <BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Prohibitions<BR>
</B>
<P>
If there is significant doubt about the need to originally
classify information, do not classify it.<BR>

<P>
Information may not be classified for the purpose
of: <BR>

<P>
Concealing violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative
error. <BR>

<P>
Preventing embarrassment to a person, organization,
or agency.<BR>

<P>
Restraining competition.<BR>

<P>
Preventing or delaying the release of information
that does not require protection in the interest of national security.
<P>
Basic scientific research information not clearly
related to the national security may not be classified.<BR>

<P>
Information may not be reclassified after it has
been declassified and officially released to the public.<BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Levels of Classification<BR>
</B>
<P>
Under EO 12958, there are still three levels of classification:
Top Secret, Secret and Confidential. The classification levels
have not changed and their definitions are pretty much the same,
but one key phrase, shown in italics below, has been added to
the end of each definition. The ability to &quot;identify or describe&quot;
the damage to the national security is critical to making a classification
decision. The original classification authority is not required
to prepare a written account of the damage at the time of the
decision to classify, but must be able to do so if the classified
information becomes the subject of a classification challenge
or a request for access (for example, under the Freedom of Information
Act or the Privacy Act).<BR>

<P>
Top Secret information is information, the unauthorized
disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally
grave damage to the national security that the original classification
authority is able to identify or describe.<BR>

<P>
Secret information is information, the unauthorized
disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious
damage to the national security that the original classification
authority is able to identify or describe.<BR>

<P>
Confidential information is information, the unauthorized
disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage
to the national security that the original classification authority
is able to identify or describe.<BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Duration of Classification<BR>
</B>
<P>
Declassification is the authorized changing of information
from classified to unclassified. When information is originally
classified, the classifier must identify a date or event upon
which the information will be declassified. The standard in this
Order is that information should normally remain classified for
no longer than 10 years. But the Order also recognizes that there
are some circumstances in which information must stay classified
longer than 10 years because disclosure would cause damage to
national security even after 10 years. The original classification
authority may exempt information from the &quot;10-year rule&quot;
if, even after 10 years, disclosure would be expected to:<BR>

<P>
Reveal an intelligence source, method or activity,
or a cryptologic system or activity (X1)<BR>

<P>
Reveal information that would assist in the development
or use of weapons of mass destruction (X2)<BR>

<P>
Reveal information that would impair the development
or use of technology within a United States weapons system (X3)
<BR>

<P>
Reveal United States military plans or national security
emergency preparedness plans (X4)<BR>

<P>
Reveal foreign government information (X5)<BR>

<P>
Damage relations between the United States and a
foreign government, reveal a confidential source, or seriously
undermine diplomatic activities that are reasonably expected to
be ongoing for a period longer than 10 years (X6)<BR>

<P>
Impair the ability of responsible United States Government
officials to protect the President, the Vice-President, and other
individuals for whom protection services, in the interest of national
security, are authorized (X7)<BR>

<P>
Violate a statute, treaty, or international agreement
(X8)
<P>
_________________________<BR>

<P>
The designators in parentheses following each item
show the exemption categories specified in Section 1.6.d of the
Executive Order. You'll need to know them when marking documents
containing exempted information.<BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Declassification Programs<BR>
</B>
<P>
You most likely won't be responsible for making declassification
decisions, but you should understand that there are three separate
programs for declassification established by the EO:<BR>

<P>
Automatic Declassification. Unless an agency head
takes specific action to extend the duration of classification,
information 25 years old and older in records that have permanent
historical value will be declassified automatically. Classification
duration may be extended beyond 25 years only under certain narrowly
defined conditions. Agencies are establishing programs to identify
information meeting those conditions. Material that is exempted
from this 25-year rule is still subject to two other declassification
programs....<BR>

<P>
Systematic Review. This is a review for possible
declassification of information contained in records that have
been determined by the Archivist of the United States to have
permanent historical value. Both the National Archives and Records
Administration and individual agencies will be conducting review
programs focused on records with substantial historical interest.
<BR>

<P>
Mandatory Review. This is a review for possible declassification
performed in response to a request received from an organization
or an individual.<BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Derivative Classification<BR>
</B>
<P>
The majority of employees in the DoD community are
derivative classifiers. This means that you incorporate, paraphrase,
restate, or generate in new form information that is already classified.
As a derivative classifier, you refer to some sort of classification
guidance (usually a classified source document or a classification
guide) and mark newly developed materials consistent with the
markings on the source or the instructions in the guide.<BR>

<P>
There are two common scenarios you will encounter
in doing derivative classification:<BR>

<P>
Sometimes, you will be copying, restating or paraphrasing
information from a single classified document as you prepare your
new document. In this case, you will put markings on your new
document consistent with those found on the source document. If
you use classified information from more than one source document,
be careful to mark your new document with the highest classification
of any of the information you used. If you have any doubt about
the proper classification to use, check the security classification
guide covering the subject, if one exists.<BR>

<P>
In other situations, you will be creating a document
without taking information from source documents. Here, you'll
check the appropriate classification guide for instructions.<BR>

<P>
A third scenario is much less common. If the information
you're using is neither covered by a classification guide nor
extracted from a classified source document, you're probably looking
at a situation where original classification should be considered.
You would assign the information a temporary (tentative) classification,
and refer the matter to the appropriate original classification
authority for a decision.<BR>

<P>
In doing derivative classification, you will need
to understand the levels of classification, what may and may not
be classified, classification guides, duration of classification,
and document marking. <BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Marking Documents<BR>
</B>
<P>
Marking is our normal means of communicating the
need to protect information. Markings must be uniformly and conspicuously
applied to documents to leave no doubt as to the classification
level, the reason for classification, the duration of classification,
and the authority or source for classification. Proper markings
are required for both hard-copy and electronic classified documents.
We'll quickly review some of the basic marking requirements. Other
markings may be required, depending on the nature of the information
and the type of document you're working with.<BR>

<P>
<B>Portion Markings<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mark each portion of a document (normally paragraphs,
but also including subjects, titles, charts, etc.) to indicate
which portions are classified and at what level, and which portions
are unclassified. To indicate the classification level, you use
the symbols &quot;(TS)&quot; for Top Secret, &quot;(S)&quot; for
Secret, &quot;(C)&quot; for Confidential, and &quot;(U)&quot;
for Unclassified.<BR>

<P>
<B>Document and Page Markings<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mark the document conspicuously with the highest
level of classification contained in the document. For example,
if a document contained some Secret information and some Confidential
information, the overall marking would be &quot;Secret.&quot;
This marking must be placed at the top and bottom of the outside
of the front cover (if any), on the title page (if any), on the
first page, and on the outside of the back cover (if any). Interior
pages of classified documents must also be marked. <BR>

<P>
<B>Source of Classification and Declassification
Instructions</B> <BR>

<P>
The Order requires each classified document to be
marked with certain information about the source or authority
for classification, duration of classification, etc. You'll find
this information on the face of a classified document. The next
page provides more information about this.<BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Source of Classification and Declassification
Instructions</B> <BR>

<P>
Two or more of the following &quot;lines&quot; will
appear on the face of a classified document. Each of them may
end up being more than a single line long. Sometimes abbreviations
are used, and may vary slightly. Generally, here's what's required....
<BR>

<P>
Classified by (or CL BY): ____________________ <BR>

<P>
Used on originally classified documents, this line
will identify the original classifier, either by name and position
title or a personal identifier. Your agency will have specific
rules for what's required here.<BR>

<P>
Reason (or CL REASON): ____________________<BR>

<P>
This is another line you'll put on originally classified
documents, and will give the reason for classifying the information,
citing the categories from section 1.5 of the Order. (They're
on page __ of this Desk Reference Guide.) For example, this line
might read &quot;1.5(a).&quot; You may also cite more than one
reason, e.g., &quot;1.5(b), (c), and (d).&quot; <BR>

<P>
Derived from (or DRV FROM): ____________________
<BR>

<P>
This line is to be used on derivatively classified
documents. On the line, place the title and date of the classification
guidance you used (source document or classification guide). If
you use more than one source document, classification guide, or
combination of the two, this line should read, &quot;Multiple
Sources.&quot; You must identify each source used in a list maintained
with the file or record copy of the document.<BR>

<P>
Declassify on (or DECL ON): ____________________
<BR>

<P>
This line provides instructions for declassification
of the information in both originally and derivatively classified
documents. What you will place on this line will vary with your
situation. It must contain a date or event for declassification
or a marking showing it's exempt from the Order's &quot;10-year
rule&quot; (for example, &quot;X7&quot;). Your security manager
or security staff can help you determine exactly how to complete
this line on your documents.<BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Classification Guides<BR>
</B>
<P>
As a derivative classifier, you will regularly refer
to one or more classification guides to identify information that
must be classified and the appropriate level and duration of classification.
Classification guides provide comprehensive, detailed, authoritative
guidance for frequently recurring items of sensitive information.
Each organization with original classification authority will
prepare and distribute its own guides. Copies of most guides are
available from the Defense Technical Information Center.<BR>

<P>
A classification guide:<BR>

<P>
States which classification level applies to each
item of information and, when useful, specify items of information
that are unclassified.<BR>

<P>
States precisely which elements of information are
to be protected.<BR>

<P>
Provides a concise reason for classification. (At
a minimum, the guide will cite the appropriate classification
category from Section 1.5 of the Order.)<BR>

<P>
Provides information about special handling caveats,
when appropriate.<BR>

<P>
Prescribes declassification instructions or the automatic
declassification exemption category for each element of information.
<BR>

<P>
States the date the guide was issued or last reviewed.
<BR>

<P>
Classification guides are updated as necessary and
reviewed at least every five years.<BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Classification Challenges<BR>
</B>
<P>
If you see a document that you believe has been improperly
classified, what should you do? EO 12958 has established guidelines
for formally challenging the classification assigned to information.
The Order states that those who challenge a classification will
be protected from retribution. In fact, you are encouraged and
expected to challenge the classification of information if you
believe that it is improper. Before resorting to the formal challenge
procedures, an attempt should be made to resolve the matter informally.
<BR>

<P>
The Order requires that every formal challenge be
reviewed by an impartial official or panel. The Interagency Security
Classification Appeals Panel will serve as an appellate review
authority.<BR>

<P>
Each DoD Component will develop specific procedures
for challenging a classification and will also establish procedures
for handling appeals.<BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Safeguarding<BR>
</B>
<P>
EO 12958 does not change the requirements for safeguarding
classified national security information. Classified information
remains restricted to those who have been granted access, signed
a non-disclosure agreement, and have a need-to-know. Classified
information may not be removed from official premises without
proper authorization. Automated information systems must prevent
access by unauthorized people and ensure the integrity of the
information. All of the other existing restrictions on using,
processing, storing, reproducing, transmitting, and disposing
of classified information remain in place.<BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Self-Inspection Programs<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Order calls for annual self-inspection programs
in every agency. Self-inspection is the internal review and evaluation
of an agency's implementation of the program established under
EO 12958 and its implementing directives.<BR>

<P>
Inspections will include a review of a sample of
classified documents that the organization has generated -- ones
that you might have classified. The primary purpose of these self-inspections
is to continuously improve the classification process and the
information security program, especially helping employees to
make better classification decisions.<BR>

<P>
------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<P>
<B>Special Access Programs<BR>
</B>
<P>
Under EO 12958, there will be greater oversight of
existing special access programs. Each program will be reviewed
annually to determine whether it should be continued.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

</B>
<P>
WESTBOROUGH, MA. - The National Security Institute,
a leading publisher of security newsletters and special reports
has 

launched a World Wide Web site devoted exclusively
to the needs of individuals with an interest in security.<BR>

<P>
NSI's Security Resource Net, available at http://nsi.org,
provides a diverse range of security information under an 

umbrella Internet site - offering a one-stop shop
for corporate and government security decision-makers. Security
managers with 

access to the Internet - through CompuServe, Prodigy,
America Online, and other servers - can easily access this comprehensive


information service. <BR>

<P>
The net site currently features a daily security
news service, C.E.R.T. computer security alerts, State Department
travel 

advisories, security technology updates along with
a growing list of new product announcements. <BR>

<P>
The Security Resource Net also offers access to a
&quot;virtual security library&quot; containing extensive data
files on numerous 

topics of interest - from computer crime to workplace
violence.  A continuously updated security calendar of events
also keeps 
managers appraised of important educational opportunities
throughout the year. 
<P>
The web site also features timely information on
consumer product recalls, as well as tips on personal safety and
security.
<P>
The Security Resource Net will soon bring the first
Security Products and Services directory on-line to the Internet
- 

featuring the most complete and current resource
of security products available. <BR>

<P>
Unlike other static guides that are published once
a year, NSI's Security Products and Services directory will be


continuously updated to reflect the latest changes
in company and product profiles. The directory can also be easily


searched by product category, company or geographic
location - helping security practitioners to quickly pinpoint
the 

information they need to do their jobs. NSI expects
to be on-line with this new service by March 1, 1996.<BR>

<P>
In addition to providing the most comprehensive coverage
of security across the Internet, NSI furnishes access to global

security information each day through its &quot;gateways&quot;
and &quot;hotlinks&quot; to hundreds of government and commercial
security-

related web sites. NSI's vision is to create a virtual
clearinghouse of security information for both the expert 
practitioner and the novice.<BR>

<P>
NSI's mandate is to gather and synthesize the most
crucial, timely security news and information from more than 1,000


publications and resources throughout the Internet
and distribute it from a central source: true low-cost, &quot;one-stop&quot;


shopping, saving security managers countless hours
in research time. <BR>

<P>
To defray costs and let readers learn more about
organizations offering security products and services that may
be of interest 

to them, the Security Resource Net makes available
advertising space and hyperlinks from its web site in exchange
for 

underwriting costs of its on-line service.<BR>

<P>
Users can access all information on the Security
Resource Net free of charge, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.<BR>

<P>
The Security Resource Net is already attracting a
high level of interest among computer users on the information
highway. 
<P>
Since its inception in August, 1995, visitors to
this web site have increased dramatically - with some 1,500 to
2,000 &quot;hits&quot; 

recorded daily. <BR>

<P>
And as the technology makes it easier for security
managers to travel through cyberspace, NSI expects an explosive
growth 

in the use of its on-line information services.<BR>

<P>
Since 1985, the National Security Institute has been
providing security education and information services through
its 

newsletters, seminars, directories and special reports.
 Each year over 250,000 readers turn to such National Security

Institute publications as the NSI Advisory, the Employee
Security Connection, Who's Who in Security, and an executive 

news service on the Internet.<BR>

<P>

Weaknesses in U.S. Security Arrangements with Foreign
Owned Defense Contractors.&quot; Please strip off this header

Defense Industrial Security: Weaknesses in U.S. Security
Arrangements With Foreign-Owned Defense Contractors (Chapter Report,
02/20/96, GAO/NSIAD-96-64).<p>
Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO reviewed
security arrangements used to protect sensitive information from
foreign-owned U.S. defense contractors that perform on classified Department
of Defense (DOD) contracts.<p>

GAO found that:<ol>
<li> security arrangements are intended
to protect foreign-owned U.S. defense contractors from undue foreign
control and to prevent foreign owners' access to classified information;
<li> there are 54 foreign-owned U.S. defense contractors operating
under security arrangements, such as voting trusts, proxy agreements,
and special security agreements; 
<li> although such companies are
not permitted access to classified information due to the risk
of foreign control, DOD authorized access to 12 of 33 special
security agreement companies; 
<li>each foreign-owned U.S. defense contractor must have
a visitation agreement with its parent company to protect against
foreign owners' unauthorized access to classified information; 
<li>individuals contacted by the parent company are required to report
on the technical discussions that took place under visitation agreements;
<li> U.S. citizens are selected for the boards of directors of
foreign-owned U.S. defense firms to protect against undue foreign control
and unauthorized access to classified information; and 
<li> most trustees feel they have limited oversight roles and do not actively check
on the implementation of security policies or engage in management
issues, and some appear to have conflicts of interest.<p>

This is an unclassified version of a classified report
issued to you in 1995. This report discusses security arrangements
known as voting trusts, proxy agreements, and special security agreements
that are used to protect sensitive information when foreign-owned
U.S.  defense contractors perform on classified Department
of Defense contracts. Our review was in response to a request
from the former Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigation, House Committee on Armed Services.
In chapter 4 of this report, we recommend improvements in trustee
oversight of information security and additional controls to prevent
potential trustee conflicts of interest. <p>

We are sending copies of this report to the Chairman
and Ranking Minority Member, Senate Committee on Armed Services,
and the Secretary of Defense. Copies will also be made available
to others upon request. <p>

Please call me at (202) 512-4587 if you or your staff
have any questions concerning this report. Other major contributors
to this report are listed in appendix II. <p>

<B>Executive Summary</B><BR>

============================================================<P>
Chapter 0<BR>
<p>
<B>Purpose</B><BR>

----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 0:1<p>
Since the mid-1980s, development, production, and
marketing of weapon systems has been increasingly internationalized through
government-sponsored cooperative development programs
and various kinds of industrial linkages, including international
subcontracting and teaming arrangements, joint ventures, and cross-border
mergers and acquisitions. Foreign companies have acquired
many U.S. defense companies and have legitimate business interests
in them. The U.S.  government allows such foreign investment as long
as it is consistent with U.S. national security interests. Some foreign-owned
U.S.   companies are working on highly classified defense
contracts, such as the B-2, the F-117, the F-22, and military satellite
programs. <p>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and intelligence
agencies have reported that foreign intelligence activities directed
at U.S.  critical technologies pose a significant threat to
national security.  According to these agencies, some close U.S. allies
are actively trying to obtain U.S. defense technologies through
unauthorized means. To reduce the national security risks of foreign
control over companies working on sensitive classified contracts,
the Department of Defense (DOD) requires controls known as voting
trusts, proxy agreements, and special security agreements (SSA).
<p>
Concerned that a major U.S. defense contractor could
be acquired by foreign interests, the former Chairman and Ranking
Minority Member, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation, House
Committee on Armed Services (now the House Committee on National Security)
asked GAO to review voting trusts, proxy agreements, and SSAs.
GAO reviewed the structure and implementation of the agreements intended
to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure
to foreign interests and to reduce the risk that foreign control
could adversely affect the companies' performance of classified contracts.
<BR>
<p>
<B>Background</B><BR>
----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 0:2<p>
The government has drafted the National Industrial
Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) to replace the DOD Industrial
Security Manual and various agencies' industrial security
requirements. The section dealing with foreign ownership, control,
or influence contains many provisions on voting trusts, proxy
agreements, and SSAs that are similar to provisions in the DOD Industrial
Security Regulation (ISR). The ISR will continue to apply
in its current form until it is amended to reflect the NISPOM. <p>
The ISR and NISPOM require a company to obtain a
facility clearance before it can work on a classified DOD contract.
To obtain a clearance, a U.S. defense contractor that is majority
foreign-owned must first accept a voting trust, proxy agreement,
or SSA to insulate it from its foreign owners. With one of these agreements
in place, some foreign-owned U.S. defense contractors have
access to some of the most highly classified information, such as Top
Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information.\1 The Defense
Investigative Service (DIS) administers DOD's Industrial Security
Program and is required to conduct compliance reviews of defense
contractors operating under voting trusts, proxy agreements,
and SSAs. <p> 
The agreements call for (1) installing one or more
foreign owner-selected, DOD-approved, cleared U.S. citizens
on the company's board of directors for management oversight and (2)
limiting contact between the U.S. company and representatives of its
foreign owners. 
The trustees, proxy holders, or SSA outside directors
(collectively

referred to as &quot;trustees&quot; in this report)
are to represent DOD's

interests by ensuring against unauthorized access
to classified

information and company actions that could adversely
affect

performance on classified contracts. Under the ISR
and the NISPOM,

voting trusts and proxy agreements must provide the
trustees with

complete freedom to act independently from the foreign
owners, and

trustees are to exercise responsibility and management
prerogatives

for the cleared U.S. companies. ISR and NISPOM requirements
for

SSAs are less specific and allow a higher potential
for foreign

control. Normally, SSA firms are not supposed to
be cleared for Top

Secret, Sensitive Compartmented Information, Special
Access Programs,

and certain other categories of classified information.
The ISR and

most implementing agreements were not intended or
designed to protect

unclassified export-controlled information. <BR>
<p>
--------------------<P>

1 Special Access Programs, Restricted Data, and
Communications

Security are also among the most highly classified
categories of

information that foreign-owned U.S. defense firms
have access to on

some DOD contracts. <BR>
<p>
<B>Results in Brief</B><BR>
----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 0:3<p>
The security arrangements GAO reviewed were not intended
or designed

to deny foreign owners the opportunity to pursue
legitimate business

with their U.S.-based companies working on classified
contracts. 

Rather, they were designed to insulate these companies
from undue

foreign control and influence and to prevent foreign
owners' access

to classified information without a clearance and
a need to know. 

Fifty-four companies operate under voting trusts,
proxy agreements,

and SSAs. GAO reviewed the controls established in
13 of these

companies and a company operating under a unique
security arrangement

called a memorandum of agreement. The structure and
implementation

of the agreements at most of the 14 companies GAO
reviewed permitted

some risk of foreign control, influence, and unauthorized
access to

classified data and technology. GAO did not determine
whether

unauthorized access to classified data or technology
actually

occurred. GAO observed the following: <p>
Thirty-six percent of SSA companies were granted
exceptions to

restrictions on their access to the most highly classified

information. <p>
Visitation agreements permitted numerous visits,
many occurring

under contracts and export licenses for military
and dual-use

products, between the foreign owners and the U.S.
defense

contractor. <p>
Most trustees performed little oversight and, at
four companies,

some trustees appeared to have conflicts of interest.
<BR>
<p>
<B>Principal Findings</B><BR>

----------------------------------------------------------<p>
Chapter 0:4<BR>
<p>
<B>Through Exceptions, SSA Firms Gain Access to Otherwise Proscribed Data</B><br>

--------------------------------------------------------<p>
Chapter 0:4.1<p>
The ISR and NISPOM allow each SSA to be tailored
to the individual

company, but SSAs have some common elements that
allow foreign owners

to exercise a high degree of control over the U.S.
firms. For

example, SSAs allow the foreign owner to have a representative
(an

&quot;inside director,&quot; often a foreign national)
on the U.S. firm's

board of directors. Although inside directors do
not hold a majority

of votes on the board, their views about the company's
direction on

certain defense contracts or product lines reflect
those of the

owners. In addition, unlike voting trusts and proxy
agreements, most

SSAs allow foreign owners to replace any member of
the board of

directors of the U.S. company for any reason. Under
new boilerplate

SSA language DOD provided to GAO, DIS will have to
approve such a

removal. <p>
Because SSAs allow greater potential for foreign
control than the

voting trust and proxy agreement, SSA firms cannot
work on Top Secret

and other highly classified contracts, except when
DOD determines it

to be in the national interest. At the time of GAO's
review, at

least 12 of the 33 SSA companies were working under
exceptions to

this restriction on at least

47 contracts that required access to Top Secret,
Special Access, and

other highly classified information. <BR>
<p>
<B>A High Degree of Contract Occurs Under Visitation Agreements</B><BR>
--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 0:4.2<p>
To address the risk of foreign parent\2 firms' personnel
gaining

unauthorized access to classified information, the
ISR requires each

voting trust, proxy agreement, and SSA company to
draw up a

visitation agreement. Under the ISR, the visitation
agreement is to

generally restrict and limit visits between personnel
of the U.S. 

defense contractor and its foreign parent firm, except
for

trustee-approved visits relating to regular day-to-day
business

operations pertaining to purely commercial products
or services. 

DOD-approved visitation agreements that permitted
a high number of

visits pertaining to military and dual-use products
and services. 

Often these visits occurred under approved export
licenses for

specific products and technologies. These licenses
and a large

number of contracts between the U.S. defense contractors
and their

foreign owners allowed considerable access to the
U.S. facilities. 

In several cases, GAO observed hundreds of visits
and long-term

visits with personnel at technical and other levels
of the companies. <p>
A primary tool for trustees and DOD to monitor visitation
by foreign

owners' representatives is post-visit reporting.
Post-visit

reporting requires the individuals contacted by the
foreign

representatives to report the substance of the discussions
that took

place. With few exceptions, the contact reports GAO
examined

identified only the individuals involved and the
title of the program

they discussed, without providing any detailed information
on

technical discussions that may have occurred. <p>
In 1993, DOD eliminated separate visitation agreements
and included

visitation controls in each voting trust, proxy agreement,
and SSA. 

The new NISPOM does not address visitation control
agreements or

procedures. According to DOD, when the ISR is amended
to reflect the

NISPOM, it will retain a requirement for visitation
approval

procedures. <BR>
<p>
--------------------<P>

2 The business arrangements between U.S. firms and
their foreign

owners may take a variety of forms, including a parent-subsidiary

relationship. This report uses those terms in general
way to

indicate affiliation rather than as a description
of the exact legal

relationship between specific U.S. and foreign entities.
<BR>
<p>
<B>Little Trustee Oversight; Some Have Appearance of Conflicts of Interest</B><BR>

--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 0:4.3<p>
The foreign owner selects and DOD approves cleared
U.S. citizens to

be placed on the boards of directors of foreign-owned
U.S. defense

contractors to guard against undue foreign influence
over company

management and to ensure against unauthorized access
to classified

information. At a few of the 14 companies GAO reviewed,
the trustees

were more actively involved in company management
and security

oversight than at the other companies. At some companies,
the

trustees maintained their responsibility for approving
all visits by

representatives of the foreign owners, as required
in the visitation

agreements. The more active trustees also interviewed
a sample of

technical staff who had been contacted by the foreign
owners to

determine the parameters of their discussions, questioned
potentially

adverse company business conditions caused by exclusive
arrangements

with the foreign parent, and attended business meetings
at the

company more often than quarterly. In most cases,
however, the

trustees delegated nearly all aspects of visitation
oversight to the

foreign-owned company's facility security officers,
who generally

lacked substantive knowledge of the company's business
affairs or

defense programs. Most trustees viewed their role
as limited to

ensuring that the company had policies designed to
protect classified

information and attending scheduled quarterly meetings
at the

company. These trustees did not actively check on
the implementation

of the security policies or remain engaged in company
management

issues. DOD security officials suggested that some
trustees needed

to take a more active oversight role. <p>
GAO also found situations at four companies that
had the appearance

of conflicts of interest among some DOD-approved
trustees. For

example, at two companies under proxy agreements,
DOD-approved

trustees also held positions as chief executive officers
at the

foreign-owned companies. As proxy holders, these
individuals were

paid up to $50,000 annually to protect DOD's security
interests,

while as chief executive officers they were paid
over $100,000 for

exercising their fiduciary duty and loyalty to the
foreign-owned

firm. GAO observed other cases giving the appearance
of conflicts of

interest (see ch. 4). <BR>
<p>
<B>Recommentaions</B><BR>

----------------------------------------------------------<p>
Chapter 0:5<p>
GAO recognizes that some security vulnerabilities
cannot be fully

eliminated, nor would the costs and benefits warrant
trying. Still,

GAO's findings indicate some improvements to information
security

could reasonably be made at firms operating under
voting trusts,

proxy agreements, and SSAs. In chapter 4, GAO makes
a number of

recommendations to the Secretary of Defense that
will improve trustee

oversight of information security and recommends
additional controls

designed to prevent potential trustee conflicts of
interest. <BR>
<p>
<B>Agency Comments and GAO's Evaluation</B><br>

----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 0:6<p>
In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD generally
agreed with

most of the report, but disagreed on some matters.
For example, DOD

agreed that visitation agreements give foreign owners
a high degree

of access to the facilities and personnel of foreign-owned
U.S. 

defense contractors, but stated that this access
is consistent with

applicable U.S. law and regulation. GAO believes
such frequent

contact, often at the technical and engineering levels,
can increase

the risk. <p>
DOD indicated classified and export-controlled unclassified

information is sufficiently protected at firms operating
under SSAs. 

However, GAO points out that DOD established restrictions
on SSA

companies' access to certain levels of classified
information since

there is a higher degree of risk assumed under SSAs.
Despite the

risk of the foreign owners' control or dominance
of the U.S. defense

contractors' operations and management, 36 percent
of SSA companies

were granted exceptions to restrictions on their
access to the most

highly classified information. <p>
While acknowledging that some trustees need to be
more actively

involved, DOD disagreed with GAO's statement that
trustees at most of

the companies reviewed did little to ensure that
company management

was not unduly influenced by the foreign owners or
that the security

controls were being properly implemented. As GAO
noted, trustees at

two firms reviewed were actively involved in company
management and

security oversight. However, GAO also reported that
in the majority

of the cases, the trustees saw their role as limited
to ensuring that

the company had policies to protect classified information,
and their

performance in this role was limited to attendance
of four meetings a

year. Following a 1993 survey of foreign-owned U.S.
defense

contractors, the Defense Intelligence Agency and
DIS concluded that

trustees that were the most successful in fulfilling
their

responsibilities were those that established procedures
that allowed

them to independently monitor and assess the implementation
of the

security agreements. They also concluded that trustees
who primarily

depended on management of the cleared facility to
implement and

monitor the security controls were less successful.
<p>
DOD stated that it generally agreed with the thrust
of the

recommendations in this report, but did not agree
that the specific

actions GAO recommended were necessary, given DOD's
efforts to

address the issues involved. DOD said it had addressed
these issues

by educating, advising, and encouraging the trustees
to take

corrective actions. However, DOD and GAO have both
seen instances in

which this encouragement has been rejected. Because
of the risk to

information with national security implications,
GAO believes that

requiring, rather than encouraging, the trustees
to improve security

at the cleared foreign-owned defense contractors
would be more

effective. Therefore, GAO continues to believe its
recommendations

are valid and believes they should be implemented
to reduce the

security risks. (See app. I.)<BR>
<p>
<B>Introduction</B><br>

============================================================<P>
Chapter 1<p>
In the last decade, weapon systems have increasingly
been developed,

produced, and marketed internationally through government-sponsored

cooperative development programs and a variety of
industry linkages. 

These linkages include international subcontracting,
joint ventures,

teaming arrangements, and cross-border mergers and
acquisitions. 

Also, the Department of Defense (DOD) and other agencies
have shared

certain highly classified information with allied
governments. U.S. 

government policy allows foreign investment as long
as it is

consistent with national security interests. Foreign
companies from

many countries have acquired numerous U.S. defense
companies and

have legitimate business interests in them. Some
of these

foreign-owned companies are working on highly classified
defense

contracts, such as the B-2, the F-117, the F-22,
and military

satellite programs. <p>
Recognizing that undue foreign control or influence
over management

or operations of companies working on sensitive classified
contracts

could compromise classified information or impede
the performance of

classified contracts, DOD requires that foreign-owned
U.S. firms

operate under control structures known as voting
trusts, proxy

agreements, and special security agreements (SSA).
Each of these

agreements requires that the foreign owners select
and DOD approve

cleared U.S. citizens\1 to be placed on the board
of directors of

the foreign-owned company to represent DOD's interests
by ensuring

against (1) foreign access to classified information
without a

clearance and a need to know and (2) company actions
that could

adversely affect performance on classified contracts.
<BR>
<p>
--------------------<P>

1 Voting trustees, proxy holders, and outside directors
under SSAs

are collectively referred to as &quot;trustees&quot;
in this report. <BR>
<p>
<B>Government Required Security Controls</B><br>

----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 1:1<p>
In February 1995, the government issued the National
Industrial

Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) to replace
the DOD

Industrial Security Manual and various agencies'
industrial security

requirements. The NISPOM's section dealing with foreign
ownership,

control, or influence (&lt;strong&gt;FOCI&lt;/strong&gt;)
contains many provisions

on voting

trusts, proxy agreements, and SSAs similar to those
in the DOD

Industrial Security Regulation (ISR). The ISR will
continue to apply

in its current form until it is amended to reflect
the NISPOM. <p>
Both the ISR and NISPOM require a company to obtain
a facility

clearance before it can work on a classified DOD
contract and

prescribe procedures for defense contractors to protect
classified

information entrusted to them. DOD's policy provides
that a firm is

ineligible for a facility clearance if it is under

&lt;strong&gt;FOCI&lt;/strong&gt;. However,

such a firm may be eligible for a facility clearance
if actions are

taken to effectively negate or reduce associated
risks to an

acceptable level. When the firm is majority foreign-owned,
the

control structures used to negate or reduce such
risks include voting

trusts, proxy agreements, and SSAs. <p>
The Defense Investigative Service (DIS) administers
the DOD

Industrial Security Program and is required to conduct
compliance

reviews of defense contractors operating under voting
trusts, proxy

agreements, and SSAs. This oversight function requires
a DIS

security inspection of the cleared facility every
6 months and an

annual &lt;strong&gt;FOCI&lt;/strong&gt; review meeting
between DIS and the trustees

of the

foreign-owned firm. These reviews are aimed at ensuring
compliance

with special controls, practices, and procedures
established to

insulate the facility from foreign interests. <BR>
<p>
<B>Voting Trusts</B><br>

--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 1:1.1<p>
Under a voting trust agreement, the foreign owners
transfer legal

title to the stock of the foreign-owned U.S. company
to U.S. 

citizen trustees. Under the ISR and NISPOM, voting
trusts must

provide trustees with complete freedom to exercise
all prerogatives

of ownership and act independently from the foreign
owners. Under

the ISR and NISPOM, five actions may require prior
approval by the

foreign owner: <p>
the sale or disposal of the corporation's assets
or a substantial

part thereof;<p>
pledges, mortgages, or other encumbrances on the
capital stock of

the cleared company;<p>
corporate mergers, consolidations, or reorganization;
<p>
the dissolution of the corporation; or<p>
the filing of a bankruptcy petition. <p>
Under the ISR, the trustees were to act independently
without

consultation with, interference by, or influence
from the foreign

owners, but the NISPOM allows for consultation between
the trustees

and foreign owners. <BR>
<p>
<B>Proxy Agreement</B><br>

--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 1:1.2<p>
The proxy agreement is essentially the same as the
voting trust, with

the exception of who holds title to the stock. Under
the voting

trust, the title to the stock is transferred to the
trustees. Under

the proxy agreement, the owners retain title to the
stock, but the

voting rights of the stock are transferred to the
DOD-approved proxy

holders by a proxy agreement. The powers and responsibilities
of the

proxy holders are the same as those of the trustees
under a voting

trust. From a security or control perspective, we
saw no difference

between the voting trust and the proxy agreement.
DOD and company

officials stated that from the companies' perspective,
the difference

between these two agreements is largely a tax issue.
<BR>
<p>
<B>Special Security Agreement</B><br>

--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 1:1.3<p>
The third type of control structure for majority
foreign-owned firms

is the SSA. Unlike a voting trust or proxy agreement,
the SSA allows

representatives of the foreign owner to be on the
U.S. contractor's

board of directors. This representative, known as
an inside

director, does not need a DOD security clearance
and can be a foreign

national. In contrast, outside directors are U.S.
citizens and must

be approved by and obtain security clearances from
DOD. Under DOD

policy, outside directors are to ensure that classified
information

is protected from unauthorized or inadvertent access
by the foreign

owners and that the U.S. company's ability to perform
on classified

contracts is not adversely affected by foreign influence
over

strategic decision-making. <p>
Because SSAs allow the foreign owners a higher potential
for control

over the U.S. defense contractor than proxies or
voting trusts,

firms operating under SSAs are generally prohibited
from accessing

highly classified information such as Top Secret
and Sensitive

Compartmented Information. However, DOD can grant
exceptions to this

prohibition and can award contracts at these highly
classified levels

if it determines it is in the national interest.
<BR>
<p>
<B>Visitation Agreement</B><br>

--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 1:1.4<p>
The ISR required a visitation agreement for each
voting trust, proxy

agreement, or SSA. This agreement was signed by 
<p>
the foreign owners,<p>
the foreign-owned U.S. firm,<p>
the trustees, and<p>
DOD. <p>
The visitation agreement was to identify the representatives
of the

foreign owners allowed to visit the cleared U.S.
firm, the purposes

for which they were allowed to visit, the advance
approval that was

necessary, and the identity of the approval authority.
In 1993, DOD

eliminated visitation agreements as separate documents
and

incorporated visitation control procedures as a section
of each

voting trust, proxy agreement, and SSA. <BR>
<p>
<B>Agreements are Negotiated and Vary</B><br>
----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 1:2<p>
Voting trust agreements, proxy agreements, SSAs,
and their attendant

visitation agreements are negotiated between the
foreign-owned

company and DOD. Although DOD has boilerplate language
that can be

adopted, according to a DOD official, many cases
have unique

circumstances that call for flexible application
of the ISR

provisions. DOD's flexible approach leads to negotiations
that can

result in company-specific agreements containing
provisions that

provide stronger or weaker controls. Generally, the
foreign owners

negotiate to secure the least restrictive agreements
possible. <p>
DOD has approved more lenient visitation agreements
and procedures

over time. A DOD official explained that DOD's flexible
approach to

&lt;strong&gt;FOCI&lt;/strong&gt; arrangements and
the resulting negotiations have

probably caused

the visitation controls to become relaxed. Each negotiated

visitation agreement that relaxed controls became
the starting point

for subsequent negotiations on new agreements as
the foreign-owned

companies' lawyers would point to the last visitation
agreement as

precedent. We recognize the need to tailor the agreements
to

specific company circumstances and to permit international
defense

work, but the lack of a baseline set of controls
in the agreements

made DIS inspections very difficult, according to
DIS inspectors. <BR>
<p>
<B>Agreements were not Designed to Protect Unlassified Export-Controlled Technologies</B><br>

----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 1:3<p>
Almost all the foreign-owned U.S. firms we reviewed
possessed

unclassified information and technologies that are
export-controlled

by the Departments of State and Commerce. DOD deemed
some of these

technologies to be militarily critical, such as carbon/carbon

material manufacturing technology and flight control
systems

technology. Many classified defense contracts involve
classified

applications of unclassified export-controlled items
and

technologies. The ISR and most agreements were not
designed to

protect unclassified export-controlled information.
As such, DIS

does not review the protection of unclassified export-controlled

technology during its inspections of cleared contractors.
In fact,

the U.S. government has no established means to monitor
compliance

with and ensure enforcement of federal regulations
regarding the

transfer of export-controlled technical information.
In light of

what is known about the technology acquisition and
diversion

intentions of certain allies (see ch. 2) and the
high degree of

contact with foreign interests at foreign-owned U.S.
defense

contractors (see ch. 3), enforcement of export control
regulations

is important. The new NISPOM reflects this concern
and requires

trustees in future voting trusts, proxy agreements,
and SSAs to take

necessary steps to ensure the company complies with
U.S. export

control laws. <BR>
<p>
<B>Fifty-Four Firms Operate Under Voting Trusts, Proxy Agreements, or SSAS</B><br>

----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 1:4<p>
As of August 1994, 54 foreign-owned U.S. defense
contractors were

operating under voting trusts, proxy agreements,
or SSAs. Six of

these companies operate under voting trusts, 15 under
proxy

agreements, and

33 under SSAs. These 54 firms held a total of 657
classified

contracts, valued at $5.4 billion. The largest firm
operating under

these agreements (as measured by the value of the
classified

contracts it held) is a computer services company
that operates under

a proxy agreement and held classified contracts valued
at $2.5

billion. The foreign owners of the

54 firms are from Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark,
France,

Germany, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden,
Switzerland, and the

United Kingdom. Currently, three of the companies
are wholly or

partially owned by foreign governments. <BR>
<p>
<B>Objective, Scope and Methodology</B><br>

----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 1:5<p>
Our review was conducted at the request of the former
Chairman and

Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigation,

House Committee on Armed Services (now the House
Committee on

National Security). Our objective was to assess the
structure of

voting trusts, proxy agreements, and SSAs and their
implementation in

the prevention of unauthorized disclosure of classified
and

export-controlled information to foreign interests.
We did not

attempt to determine whether unauthorized access
to classified or

export-controlled data/technology actually occurred.
Rather, we

examined the controls established in the ISR, the
draft NISPOM, and

the agreements' structures and the way they were
implemented at each

of 14 companies we selected to review. <p>
We discussed security issues involving foreign-owned
defense

contractors and information security with officials
from the Office

of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence,

Security Countermeasures and Spectrum Management);
DIS; and

information security officials from the Air Force,
the Army, and the

Navy. We also discussed the performance of Special
Access and

Sensitive Compartmented contracts by foreign-owned
companies with an

official from the office of the Assistant Deputy
Under Secretary of

Defense (Security Policy). To obtain information
on the threat of foreign espionage against U.S. defense industries,
we interviewed officials and reviewed documents from the Central
Intelligence Agency

(CIA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI). <p>
In selecting the 14 companies for our judgmental
sample, we included 5 companies\2 that were wholly or partially owned
by foreign governments. We selected the nine additional foreign-owned
firms on the basis of (1) the sensitivity of the information
they held, (2) agreement types, (3) country of origin, and (4) geographic
location. One company we reviewed operated under a voting trust,
five operated under proxy agreements, and six operated under SSAs.
In addition, one firm transitioned from an SSA to a proxy agreement
during our review, and we found that another firm operated under
a different control structure, a memorandum of agreement (MOA).
Table 1.1 shows the countries of ownership and agreement type of
the companies we reviewed. <BR>
<BR>

This judgmental sample reflects the distribution
of agreement type and country of ownership of the 54 companies operating
under voting trusts, proxy agreements, and SSAs. However, due
to the small size of our sample and the nonrandom nature of its selection,
the results of our review cannot be projected to the universe
of all companies operating under these agreements. <p>

We were initially told that an aerospace company
operated under an SSA, and selected the company for our sample based
on foreign government ownership of companies that are its partial
owners. We subsequently learned that the company operated under
a unique arrangement--an MOA . Because of the foreign government
ownership component and the sensitivity of the information
accessed by this aerospace company, we retained the company in our
sample. When we present statistics in our report on the number of
companies operating under voting trusts, proxy agreements, and SSAs and
the number of contracts they hold and the contracts' value, this
company is not included in those numbers.<p>
3 However, we include the company in the discussions of control structures and their implementation
(see chs. 3 and 4). In those instances, we specifically refer
to the MOA. <p>

We compared the agreements of the 14 companies to
each other and to boilerplate agreements provided by DIS. We also examined
the agreements' provisions to determine if they met the
requirements of the ISR, the regulation in force at the time. We
examined the visitation approval procedures and standard practice
procedures manuals at the companies we reviewed to determine
how the companies controlled foreign visitors and their access to the
cleared facilities. We also interviewed company management,
security personnel, and the company trustees to determine
how they implemented the agreements. To assess implementation of the agreements,
we reviewed annual company implementation reports, board
of directors minutes, defense security committee minutes, visitation
logs, international telephone bills, and various internal
company correspondence and memorandums. To assess trustee
involvement, we interviewed trustees and reviewed visitation approvals,
as well as trustee meeting minutes, which showed the frequency
of meetings, individuals' attendance records, and topics of discussion.
We also discussed each company's implementation of the agreements
and its information security programs with the cognizant
DIS regional management and inspectors and reviewed their inspection
reports. <BR>
<p>
--------------------<BR>

2 Two of these five companies no longer operate
under SSAs. One of them was sold to American interests, and the other
no longer performs on classified contracts. <p>
3 At the time of our review, the aerospace company
operating under an MOA held 10 classified contracts valued at approximately
$1.0 billion. <BR>
<p>
<B>Access Limitation</B><br>

--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 1:5.1<p>
During our review, we had limited access to certain
information. 

Foreign-owned contractors were working on various
contracts and programs classified as Special Access Programs or
Sensitive Compartmented Information. We were told by an official
from the Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of
Defense (Security Policy) that in some instances, it is not possible
to acknowledge the existence of such contracts to individuals who are
not specifically cleared for the program. As a result, we may not
know of all foreign-owned firms involved in highly classified
work. <p>

DOD provided written comments on a draft of this
report. The complete text of those comments and our response
is presented in appendix I. We performed our review from August 1992
through February 1995 in accordance with generally accepted
government auditing standards. <BR>
<p>
<B>Espionage Threat and Information at Risk</B><br>
============================================================<P>
Chapter 2<p>
Some close U.S. allies actively seek to obtain classified
and technical information from the United States through
unauthorized means. Through its National Security Threat List
program, the FBI National Security Division has determined that foreign
intelligence activities directed at U.S. critical technologies
pose a significant threat to national security. As we testified before
the House Committee on the Judiciary in April 1992, sophisticated
methods are used in espionage against U.S. companies. 1 Unfortunately,
the companies targeted by foreign intelligence agencies
may not know--and may never know--that they have been targeted or compromised.
<p>
The Joint Security Commission was formed in 1993
at the request of the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central
Intelligence to develop new approaches to security. The Commission
examined (1) policies and procedures regarding foreign ownership
or control of industrial firms performing classified contracts
and (2) the national disclosure of classified information to permit export
and coproduction of classified weapon systems. In its
February 1994 report, the Commission wrote the following: <p>
&quot;The risk in each of these situations is that
foreign entities will exploit the relationship in ways that do not
serve our overall national goals of preserving our technological
advantages and curtailing proliferation. These goals
generally include keeping certain nations from obtaining the
technical capabilities to develop and produce advanced weapon
systems and from acquiring the ability to counter advanced US
weapon systems. In cases where U.S. national interests require
the sharing of some of our capabilities with foreign
governments, security safeguards must ensure that foreign disclosures
do not go beyond their authorized scope. Safeguards must
also be tailored to new proliferation threats and applied
effectively to the authorization of foreign investment in classified
defense industry and the granting of access by foreign representatives
to our classified facilities and information.&quot;
<p>
Contractors owned by companies and governments of
these same allied countries are working on classified DOD contracts
under the protection of voting trusts, proxy agreements, and
SSAs. These companies perform on DOD contracts developing, producing,
and maintaining very sensitive military systems, and
some of them have access to the most sensitive categories of U.S. classified
information. <BR>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>

The following are examples of some sensitive contract
work being

performed by the 14 foreign-owned U.S. companies
we reviewed: <p>
development of computer software for planning target
selection and

aircraft routes in the event of a nuclear war (a
Top Secret

contract);<p>
maintenance of DOD's Worldwide Military Command and
Control System

((WWMCCS) - the contract was classified TS, SCI,
and COMSEC

because of the information the computer-driven communications

system contains);<p>
production of signal intelligence gathering radio
receivers for the

U.S. Navy;<p>
production of command destruct receivers for military
missiles and

National Aeronautics and Space Administration rockets
(to

destroy a rocket that goes off course);<p>
production of carbon/carbon composite Trident D-5
missile heat

shields; and<p>
production of the flight controls for the B-2, the
F-117, and the

F-22. <p>
Some of the contracts these foreign-owned U.S. companies
are working

on are Special Access Programs. Due to the special
access

requirements of these contracts, the contractors
could not tell us

what type of work they were doing, what military
system the work was

for, or even the identity of the DOD customer. <p>
Some of the contracts performed by companies we examined
involve less

sensitive technologies. For example, one company
we visited had

contracts requiring access to classified information
because it cast

valves for naval nuclear propulsion systems, and
it needed classified

test parameters for the valves. Another firm operating
under an SSA

is required to have a Secret-level clearance because
it installs

alarm systems in buildings that hold classified information.
<p>
In addition to classified information, most of the
14 foreign-owned

companies we reviewed possessed unclassified technical
information

and hardware items that are export- controlled by
the State or

Commerce Departments. DOD deemed many of these technologies
to be

militarily critical. <BR>
<p>
<B>U.S. Intelligence Agencies Identified Economic Espionage Efforts of Certain Allies</B><br>

----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 2:2<p>
Reports and briefings provided during 1993 by U.S.
intelligence

agencies showed a continuing economic espionage threat
from certain

U.S. allies.\2 Eight of the 54 companies operating
under voting

trusts, proxy agreements, and SSAs and working on
classified

contracts are owned by interests from one of these
countries. The

following are intelligence agency threat assessments
and examples

illustrating this espionage. <BR>
<p>
--------------------<P>

2 &quot;Economic espionage&quot; was defined in
a 1994 U.S. government

interagency report as &quot;government-sponsored
or coordinated

intelligence activity designed to unlawfully and
covertly obtain

classified data and/or sensitive policy or proprietary
information

from a U.S. Government agency or company, potentially
having the

effect of enhancing a foreign country's economic
competitiveness and

damaging U.S. economic security.&quot;<BR>
<p>
<B>Country A</B><br>

--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 2:2.1<p>
According to a U.S. intelligence agency, the government
of Country A

conducts the most aggressive espionage operation
against the United

States of any U.S. ally. Classified military information
and

sensitive military technologies are high-priority
targets for the

intelligence agencies of this country. Country A
seeks this

information for three reasons: (1) to help the technological

development of its own defense industrial base, (2)
to sell or trade

the information with other countries for economic
reasons, and (3) to

sell or trade the information with other countries
to develop

political alliances and alternative sources of arms.
According to a

classified 1994 report produced by a U.S. government
interagency

working group on U.S. critical technology companies,\3
Country A

routinely resorts to state-sponsored espionage using
covert

collection techniques to obtain sensitive U.S. economic
information

and technology. Agents of Country A collect a variety
of classified

and proprietary information through observation,
elicitation, and

theft. <p>
The following are intelligence agency examples of
Country A

information collection efforts: <p>
An espionage operation run by the intelligence organization

responsible for collecting scientific and technologic

information for Country A paid a U.S. government
employee to

obtain U.S. classified military intelligence documents.
<p>
Several citizens of Country A were caught in the
United States

stealing sensitive technology used in manufacturing
artillery

gun tubes. <p>
Agents of Country A allegedly stole design plans
for a classified

reconnaissance system from a U.S. company and gave
them to a

defense contractor from Country A. <p>
A company from Country A is suspectecd of surreptitiously

monitoring a DOD telecommunications system to obtain
classified

information for Country A intelligence. <p>
Citizens of Country A were investigated for allegations
of passing

advanced aerospace design technology to unauthorized
scientists

and researchers. <p>
Country A is suspected of targeting U.S. avionics,
missile

telemetry and testing data, and aircraft communication
systems

for intelligence operations. <p>
It has been determined that Country A targeted specialized
software

that is used to store data in friendly aircraft warning
systems. <p>
Country A has targeted information on advanced materials
and

coatings for collection. A Country A government agency

allegedly obtained information regarding a chemical
finish used

on missile reentry vehicles from a U.S. person.

3 Report on U.S. Critical Technology Companies,
Report to Congress

on Foreign Acquisition of and Espionage Activities
Against U.S. 

Critical Technology Companies (1994). <BR>
<p>
<B>Country B</B><br>

--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 2:2.2<p>
According to intelligence agencies, in the 1960s,
the government of

Country B began an aggressive and massive espionage
effort against

the United States. The 1994 interagency report on
U.S. critical

technology companies pointed out that recent international

developments have increased foreign intelligence
collection efforts

against U.S. economic interests. The lessening of
East-West

tensions in the late 1980s and early 1990s enabled
Country B

intelligence services to allocate greater resources
to collect

sensitive U.S. economic information and technology.
<p>
Methods used by Country B are updated versions of
classic Cold War

recruitment and technical operations. The Country
B government

organization that conducts these activities does
not target U.S. 

national defense information such as war plans, but
rather seeks U.S. 

technology. The motivation for these activities is
the health of

Country B's defense industrial base. Country B considers
it vital to

its national security to be self-sufficient in manufacturing
arms. 

Since domestic consumption will not support its defense
industries,

Country B must export arms. Country B seeks U.S.
defense

technologies to incorporate into domestically produced
systems. By

stealing the technology from the United States, Country
B can have

cutting-edge weapon systems without the cost of research
and

development. The cutting-edge technologies not only
provide superior

weapon systems for Country B's own use, but also
make these products

more marketable for exports. It is believed that
Country B espionage

efforts against the U.S. defense industries will
continue and may

increase. Country B needs the cutting-edge technologies
to compete

with U.S. systems in the international arms market.
<p>
The following are intelligence agency examples of
Country B

information collection efforts: <p>
In the late 1980s, Country B's intelligence agency
recruited agents

at the European offices of three U.S. computer and
electronics

firms. The agents apparently were stealing unusually
sensitive

technical information for a struggling Country B
company. This

Country B company also owns a U.S. company operating
under a

proxy agreement and performing contracts for DOD
classified as

TS, SAP, SCI, and COMSEC. <p>
Country B companies and government officials have
been investigated

for suspected efforts to acquire advanced abrasive
technology

and stealth-related coatings. <p>
Country B representatives have been investigated
for targeting

software that performs high-speed, real-time computational

analysis that can be used in a missile attack system.
<p>
Information was obtained that Country B targeted
a number of U.S. 

defense companies and their missile and satellite
technologies

for espionage efforts. Companies of Country B have
made

efforts, some successful, to acquire targeted companies.
<BR>
<p>
<B>Country C</B><br>

--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 2:2.3<p>
The motivation for Country C industrial espionage
against the United

States is much like that of Country B: Country C
wants cutting-edge

technologies to incorporate into weapon systems it
produces. The

technology would give Country C armed forces a quality
weapon and

would increase the weapon's export market potential.
The Country C

government intelligence organization has assisted
Country C industry

in obtaining defense technologies, but not as actively
as Country B

intelligence has for its industry. One example of
Country C

government assistance occurred in the late 1980s,
when a Country C

firm wanted to enter Strategic Defense Initiative
work. At that

time, the Country C intelligence organization assisted
this firm in

obtaining applicable technology. <BR>
<p>
<B>Country D</B><br>

--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 2:2.4<p>
The Country D government has no official foreign
intelligence

service. Private Country D companies are the intelligence
gatherers. 

They have more of a presence throughout the world
than the Country D

government. However, according to the 1994 interagency
report, the

Country D government obtains much of the economic
intelligence that

Country D private-sector firms operating abroad collect
for their own

purposes. This occasionally includes classified foreign
government

documents and corporate proprietary data. Country
D employees have

been quite successful in developing and exploiting
Americans who have

access to classified and proprietary information.
<p>
The following are examples of information collection
efforts of

Country D: <p>
Firms from Country D have been investigated for targeting
advanced

propulsion technologies, from slush-hydrogen fuel
to torpedo

target motors, and attempting to export these items
through

intermediaries and specialty shipping companies in
violation of

export restrictions. <p>
Individuals from Country D have been investigated
for allegedly

passing advanced aerospace design technology to unauthorized

scientists and researchers. <p>
Electronics firms from Country D directed information-gathering

efforts at competing U.S. firms in order to increase
the market

share of Country D in the semiconductor field. <BR>
<p>
<B>Country E</B><br>

--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 2:2.5<p>
Intelligence community officials stated that they
did not have

indications that the intelligence service of Country
E has targeted

the United States or its defense industry for espionage
efforts. 

However, according to the 1994 interagency report,
in 1991 the

intelligence service of this country was considering
moving toward

what it called &quot;semi-overt&quot; collection
of foreign economic

intelligence. At that time, Country E's intelligence
service

reportedly planned to increase the number of its
senior officers in

Washington to improve its semi-overt collection--probably
referring

to more intense elicitation from government and business
contacts. <p>
The main counterintelligence concern cited by one
intelligence agency

regarding Country E is not that its government may
be targeting the

United States with espionage efforts, but that any
technology that

does find its way into Country E will probably be
diverted to

countries to which the United States would not sell
its defense

technologies. The defense industry of this country
is of particular

concern in this regard. <p>
It was reported that information diversions from
Country E have

serious implications for U.S. national security.
Large-scale losses

of technology were discovered in the early 1990s.
Primary

responsibility for industrial security resides in
a small staff of

the government of Country E. It was reported that
this limited staff

often loses when its regulatory concerns clash with
business

interests. The intelligence agency concluded that
the additional

time needed to eradicate the diversion systems will
consequently

limit the degree of technological security available
for several

years. The question suggested by this situation is,
if technology

from a U.S. defense contractor owned by interests
of Country E is

transferred to Country E, will this U.S. defense
technology then be

diverted to countries to which the United States
would not sell? <BR>
<p>
<B>Assesment of Control Structures</B><br>

============================================================<P>
Chapter 3<p>
Foreign ownership or control of U.S. firms performing
classified

contracts for DOD poses a special security risk.
The risk includes

unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of classified
information

available to the U.S. firm. In addition, foreign
owners could take

action that would jeopardize the performance of classified
contracts. 

To minimize the risks, the ISR and NISPOM require
voting trusts and

proxy agreements to insulate the foreign owners from
the cleared U.S. 

defense firm or SSAs to limit foreign owners' participation
in the

management of the cleared U.S. firm. The ISR also
required

visitation agreements to control visitation between
foreign owners

and their cleared U.S. firms. The new industrial
security program

manual does not address visitation control agreements
or procedures. 

DOD eliminated separate visitation agreements in
favor of visitation

procedures in the security agreements themselves.
<p>
In May 1992, a former Secretary of Defense testified
before the House

Committee on Armed Services that under proxy agreements
and voting

trusts, the foreign owners of U.S. companies working
on classified

contracts had &quot;virtually no say except if somebody
wants to sell the

company or in very major decisions.&quot; He indicated
that for the

purposes of the foreign parent company, proxy agreements
and voting

trusts are essentially &quot;blind trusts.&quot;
Further, he testified that a

number of companies were &quot;functioning successfully&quot;
under SSAs. <p>
Of the three types of arrangements used to negate
or reduce risks in

majority foreign ownership cases, SSAs were the least
restrictive. 

Accordingly, SSA firms pose a somewhat higher risk
associated with

classified work. The ISR and the NISPOM generally
prohibit SSA firms

from being involved in Top Secret and other highly
sensitive

contracts, but allow for exceptions if DOD determines
they are in the

national interest. SSA firms we reviewed were working
on 47

contracts classified as TS, SCI, SAP, RD, and COMSEC.
In addition,

we observed that ISR-required visitation agreements
permitted

significant contact between the U.S. firms and the
foreign owners. <BR>
<p>
<B>Higher Degree of Risk with SSA Structure</B><br>

----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 3:1<p>
Unlike voting trusts and proxy agreements, which
insulate foreign

owners from the management of the cleared firm, SSAs
allow foreign

owners to appoint a representative to serve on the
board of

directors. Called an &quot;inside director,&quot;
this individual represents

the foreign owners and is often a foreign national.
The inside

director is to be counterbalanced by DOD-approved
directors, called

the &quot;outside directors.&quot; The principal
function of the outside

directors is to protect U.S. security interests.
<p>
Inside directors cannot hold a majority of the votes
on the board,

but because of their connection to the foreign owners,
their views

about the company's direction on certain defense
contracts or product

lines reflect those of the owners. Depending on the
composition of

the board, the inside director and the company officers
on the board

could possibly combine to out vote the outside directors.
In

addition, unlike voting trusts and proxy agreements,
the SSAs we

examined allow the foreign owner to replace &quot;any
member of the [SSA

company] Board of Directors for any reason.&quot;
DOD recently provided us

with new boilerplate SSA language that will require
DIS to approve

the removal of a director. <p>
Foreign owners of SSA firms can also exercise significant
influence

over the U.S. companies they own in other ways. For
example, at two

SSA firms we examined, the foreign owners used export
licenses to

obtain unclassified technology from the U.S. subsidiary
that was

vital to the U.S. companies' competitive positions.
Officers of the

U.S. companies stated that they did not want to share
these

technologies, but the foreign owners required them
to do so. 

Subsequently, one of these U.S. companies faced its
own technology

in a competition with its foreign owner for a U.S.
Army contract. <BR>
<p>
<B>SSA Firms Working on Contracts Requiring Access to Top Secret, Special Access, and other Sensitive Information</B><br>

--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 3:1.1<p>
Because of the additional risk previously mentioned,
companies

operating under SSAs are normally ineligible for
contracts allowing

access to TS, SAP, SCI, RD, and COMSEC information.
However, during

our review,

12 of the 33 SSA companies were working on at least
47 contracts

requiring access to this highly classified information.
<p>
Before June 1991, DOD reviewed an SSA firm to determine
whether it

would be in the national interest to allow the firm
to compete for

contracts classified TS, SCI, SAP, RD, or COMSEC.
New guidance was

issued in June 1991 requiring the responsible military
service to

make a national interest determination each time
a highly classified

contract was awarded to an SSA firm. We found only
one

contract-specific national interest determination
had been written

since the June 1991 guidance. According to DOD officials,
the other

46 highly classified contracts performed by SSA companies
predated

June 1991 or were follow-on contracts to contracts
awarded before

June 1991. Since information on some contracts awarded
to SSA

companies is under special access restrictions, DOD
officials may be

authorized to conceal the contracts from people not
specifically

cleared for access to the program. We, therefore,
could not

determine with confidence if the requirement for
contract-specific

national interest determinations was carried out.
<BR>
<p>
<B>One Company Operates Under an Alternate Agreement</B><br>
--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 3:1.2<p>
One company performs on contracts classified as TS,
SCI, SAP, RD, and

COMSEC under an alternative arrangement called an
MOA. The MOA (a

unique agreement) was created in 1991 because the
company has

classified DOD contracts and, although foreign interests
do not hold

a majority of the stock, they own 49 percent of the
company and have

special rights to veto certain actions of the majority
owners. <p>
Normally, under the ISR, minority foreign investment
in a cleared

U.S. defense contractor required only a resolution
of the board of

directors stating that the foreign interests will
not require, nor be

given, access to classified information. DOD did
not consider the

board resolution appropriate for this case, partially
because of the

board membership of the foreign owners and their
veto rights over

certain basic corporate decisions. The company board
of directors

consists of six representatives appointed by the
U.S. owners and one

representative for each of the four foreign minority
interests. Any

single foreign director can block any of 16 specified
actions of the

board of directors. These actions include the adoption
of a company

strategic plan or annual budget as well as the development
of a new

product that varies from the lines of business set
forth in the

strategic plan. In addition, any two foreign directors
can block an

additional 11 specified actions. These veto rights
could give the

foreign interests significantly more control and
influence over the

U.S. defense contractor in certain instances than
would be permitted

in an SSA. In 1991, DIS objected to an agreement
less stringent than

an SSA because of the veto rights of the foreign
directors and,

unlike an SSA, an MOA does not require any DOD-approved
outside

members on the board of directors. However, the Office
of the Under

Secretary of Defense for Policy determined that the
company would not

be under foreign domination and that the MOA was
a sufficient

control. <p>
DOD reexamined the MOA during a subsequent (1992)
foreign investment

in the company and made some modifications. Although
the MOA does

not provide for outside members on the board, it
does require

DOD-approved outside members on a Defense Security
Committee to

oversee the protection of classified and export-controlled

information. The first version of the MOA did not
give the outside

security committee members the right to attend any
board of directors

meetings. Under the revised (1992) version of the
MOA, the outside

security committee members still do not have general
rights to attend

board meetings; however, their attendance at board
meetings is

required if the foreign interests are to exercise
their veto rights. 

Also, the first version of the MOA did not require
any prior security

committee approval for representatives of the foreign
interests to

visit the cleared U.S. defense contractor. The newer
version

requires prior approval when the visits concern performance
on a

classified contract.1<BR>
<p>
--------------------<P>

1 The 1995 NISPOM now requires a Security Control
Agreement (SCA) in

cases where minority foreign owners are represented
on the board of

directors. The SCA is more stringent in some respects
than the MOA,

and is essentially an SSA for cases of minority foreign
investment. 

For example, the SCA requires that outside directors
be placed on the

company's board of directors. <BR>
<p>
<B>Visitation Agreements Give Foreign Owners A High Degree of Access</B><br>
----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 3:2<p>
Unlike the new NISPOM, the ISR required the foreign
owners of a

cleared U.S. defense contractor to be segregated
from all aspects of

the U.S. company's defense work. The ISR provided
the following: <p>
&quot;In every case where a voting trust agreement,
proxy agreement,

or special security agreement is employed to eliminate
risks

associated with foreign ownership, a visitation agreement
shall

be executed . . .&quot;<p>
Further: <p>
&quot;The visitation agreement shall provide that,
as a general rule,

visits between the foreign stockholder and the cleared
U.S. 

firm are not authorized; however, as an exception
to the general

rule, the trustees, may approve such visits in connection
with

regular day-to-day business operations pertaining
strictly to

purely commercial products or services and not involving

classified contracts.&quot;<p>
The visitation agreements are to guard against foreign
owners or

their representatives obtaining access to classified
information

without a clearance and a need to know. <p>
At all 14 companies we reviewed, visitation agreements
permitted the

foreign owners and their representatives to visit
regarding military

and dual-use products and services. The visitation
agreements

permitted visits to the U.S. company (1) in association
with

classified contracts if the foreign interests had
the appropriate

security clearance and (2) under State or Commerce
Department export

licenses. <p>
The large number of business transactions between
the U.S. defense

contractors and their foreign owners granted representatives
of the

foreign owners frequent entry to the cleared U.S.
facilities. Eight

of the

14 firms we reviewed had contractual arrangements
with their foreign

owners that led to a high (often daily) degree of
contact. In one

case, the U.S. company sold and serviced equipment
produced by the

foreign firm, so the two firms had almost continual
contact at the

technician level to obtain repair parts and technical
assistance. 

During a 3-month period in 1993, this company approved
167 extended

visit authorizations. <p>
At one SSA firm we reviewed, 236 visits occurred
between the U.S. 

firm and representatives of the foreign owners over
a 1-year period,

averaging about 7 days per visit. At a proxy company,
there were 322

approved requests for contact with representatives
of the owners

during a 1-year period; 94 of the requests were blanket
requests for

multiple contacts over the subsequent 3-month period.
Not all

foreign-owned defense contractors had this degree
of contact with

representatives of their foreign owners. One SSA
firm had only 44

visits with representatives of its foreign owners
during a 1-year

period. <p>
Some visitation agreements permitted long-term visits
to the cleared

U.S. companies by employees of the foreign owners.
Five companies

we reviewed had employees of the foreign owners working
at the

cleared U.S. facilities. In a number of these cases,
they were

technical and managerial staff working on military
and dual-use

systems and products under approved export licenses.
One company

covered by a proxy agreement had a foreign national
technical manager

from the foreign parent firm review the space and
military

technologies of the U.S. defense contractor to determine
if there

were opportunities for technical cooperation with
the foreign parent

firm. At another firm we reviewed, representatives
of the foreign

partners are permanently on site. At yet another
company, a foreign

national employee of the foreign parent company worked
on a computer

system for the B-2 bomber and had access to export-controlled

information without the U.S. company obtaining the
required export

license. <BR>
<p>
<B>Lack of Post-Visit Reporting Requirements</B><br>

--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 3:2.1<p>
Post-visit contact reports are the primary means
for DIS and the

trustees to monitor the substance of contacts between
the

foreign-owned U.S. contractor and representatives
of its foreign

owners. Such records should be used to determine
if the contact with

representatives of the foreign owners was appropriate
and in

accordance with the ISR and the visitation agreement.
Some

visitation agreements do not require employees of
the U.S. firm to

document and report the substance of the discussions
with employees

of the foreign parent firm. At three of the firms
we reviewed, the

only record of contact between employees of the U.S.
company and the

foreign owners were copies of forms approving the
visit. However, at

other foreign-owned U.S. defense contractors, post-visit
contact

reports were available for DIS to review when it
inspected the firms

and when DIS held its annual agreement compliance
review with the

foreign-owned companies. <BR>
<p>
<B>Telephonic Contacts not Controlled</B><br>

--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 3:2.2<p>
The ISR, the NISPOM, and most of the visitation agreements
we

reviewed do not require telephonic contacts between
the U.S. defense

contractor and representatives of its foreign owners
to be controlled

and documented. One of the firms covered by a proxy
agreement

documented 1,912 telephonic contacts between the
U.S. company and

representatives of its foreign owners for a 1-year
period. After

examining telephone bills at other companies, we
found 1 SSA company

had over 550 telephone calls to the country of the
foreign owners in

1 month. Company officials said these calls were
primarily to

representatives of the foreign owners. In contrast,
our review of

telephone bills at another SSA company showed only
47 telephone calls

to the country of the foreign owners during 1 month
in 1993. <p>
If an individual intends to breach security, it would
be easier to

transfer classified or export-controlled information
by telephone,

facsimile, or computer modem than it would be in
person. Documenting

telephone contacts would not prevent such illegal
activity, but might

make it easier to detect. During our review, DIS
also recognized

this and asked companies to establish a procedure
for documenting

telephonic contacts with representatives of their
foreign owners. <BR>
<p>
<B>National Industrial Industrial Security Manual Has No Requirement for Vistitation Agreements</B><br>
--------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 3:2.3<p>
We were initially told the NISPOM section dealing
with foreign

ownership, control, and influence would replace the

&lt;strong&gt;FOCI&lt;/strong&gt; section of

the ISR. The new manual does not address visitation
control

agreements or procedures to restrict visitation between
the cleared

U.S. defense contractor and representatives of its
foreign owners. 

Instead, it appears to allow unlimited visitation.
However, in its

comments on our report, DOD stated that the ISR will
be retained and

revised to reflect the NISPOM. DOD also said that
the revised ISR

will require visitation approval procedures, but
instead of separate

visitation agreements, these procedures will be incorporated
into

each voting trust, proxy agreement, and SSA. <BR>
<p>
<B>Conclusions</B><br>

----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 3:3<p>
Under the ISR and the new NISPOM, majority foreign-owned
facilities

cleared to perform classified contracts must enter
into agreements

with DOD to negate, or at least reduce to an acceptable
level, the

security risks associated with foreign ownership,
control, and

influence. Voting trusts and proxy agreements are
designed to

insulate cleared U.S. defense firms from their foreign
owners. SSAs

limit the foreign owners' participation in company
management. None

of these security arrangements is intended to deny
U.S. defense

contractors the opportunity to do business with their
foreign owners. 

However, the frequent contact engendered by legitimate
unclassified

business transactions can heighten the risk of unauthorized
access to

classified information. Also, existing visitation
agreements and

procedures permit a high degree of contact. Often
this contact is at

the technical and engineer level where U.S. classified
information

could most easily be compromised. The draft NISPOM
does not address

visitation controls, but DOD has stated that a visitation
approval

procedures section will be included in the revised
ISR. <BR>
<p>
<B>Assessment of Control Implementation</B><br>

============================================================<P>
Chapter 4<p>
At a few of the 14 companies we reviewed, DOD-approved
trustees were

actively involved in company management and security
oversight. At

most of the companies, however, the trustees did
little to protect

classified or export-controlled information from
access by foreign

owner representatives. At proxy agreement companies,
we observed

cases where foreign owners were exercising more control
than the ISR

allowed and foreign-owned U.S. defense firms whose
independence was

degraded because of their financial reliance on the
foreign owners. 

We also observed that some DOD-approved trustees
appeared to have

conflicts of interest. Finally, DIS did not tailor
its inspections

of these foreign-owned facilities to specifically
address

&lt;strong&gt;FOCI&lt;/strong&gt; issues

or the implementation of the control agreements,
but has recently

promulgated new inspection guidelines to address
these issues. <BR>
<p>
<B>Little Involement by Trustees in Security or Company Management Oversight</B><br>
----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 4:1<p>
Some DOD-approved trustees were more actively involved
in management

and security oversight than others. For example,
at some companies,

the trustees retained, and did not delegate, their
responsibility for

approving all visits by representatives of the foreign
owners as

required in the visitation agreements. The more active
trustees also

reviewed post-visit contact reports and interviewed
a sample of

technical staff who met with the foreign owners'
representatives to

ascertain the substance of their discussions, questioned
potentially

adverse business conditions caused by arrangements
with the foreign

parent, and attended business meetings at the company
more often than

quarterly. <p>
At most of the companies we reviewed, however, the
trustees (or proxy

holders or outside directors) did little to ensure
that company

management was not unduly influenced by the foreign
owners or that

the control structures in the security agreements
were being properly

implemented. Instead, they viewed their role as limited
to ensuring

that policies exist within the company to protect
classified

information. At six of the firms we reviewed, monitoring
the

security implementation and the business operations
of the company by

the trustees ranged from limited to almost nonexistent.
In only two

of the firms did the trustees appear to be actively
involved in

company management and security oversight. <p>
The need for trustee oversight of the business management
of

foreign-owned companies was highlighted at one SSA
firm we examined. 

At this company, the foreign owners exercised their
SSA powers to

replace two successive director/presidents of the
U.S. company. The

first claimed he was terminated because he attempted
to enforce the

SSA. The second president contested his dismissal
because the

outside directors were not given prior notice of
the owners' intent

to replace him. The owners stated that in both cases,
poor business

performance was the cause for termination and, in
these cases, the

outside directors agreed. Nevertheless, outside directors
need to

remain actively involved in monitoring the companies'
business

management to ensure that foreign owners exercise
these powers only

for legitimate business reasons and not for reasons
that could

jeopardize classified information and contracts.
<p>
Implementation and monitoring of the information
security program was

usually left to the facility security officer (FSO),
an employee of

the foreign-owned U.S. company. At the companies
we reviewed, a

variety of personnel served as FSO, including a general
counsel,

secretaries, and professional security officers.
In any case, the

FSO often performed the administrative functions
of security and

lacked the knowledge to determine the proper parameters
for the

substance of classified discussions, given a cleared
foreign

representative's need to know. This limitation and
the FSO's

potential vulnerability as an employee of the foreign-owned
company

pose a risk without active trustee involvement. 
<p>
Another potential problem associated with trustees
relinquishing

implementation and monitoring responsibilities to
the FSO was

illustrated at an SSA firm we reviewed. At the SSA
firm, the FSO

wanted to establish a new security procedure, but
was overruled by

the president of the foreign-owned U.S. defense company.
In this

instance, the FSO had enough confidence in the outside
directors to

go to them and complain. The outside directors agreed
with the need

for the new control and required its implementation.
In this case,

the outside directors led the officials of the foreign-owned
firm to

believe that the new security measure was an outside
director

initiative. If the circumstances and individuals
had been different,

the FSO might have lacked the confidence to seek
the assistance of

the outside directors. <p>
At the foreign-owned companies we reviewed, trustees
were paid

between $1,500 and $75,000 a year. In return for
this compensation,

the usual trustee involvement was attendance at four
meetings

annually. Typically, one of the trustees is designated
to approve

requests for visits with representatives of the foreign
owners. This

additional duty involves occasionally receiving,
reviewing, and

transmitting approval requests by facsimile machine.
<p>
The ISR requires that a trustee approve visitation
requests. 

However, in most of the firms we reviewed, trustees
only directly

approved visits between senior management of the
U.S. firm and the

foreign parent firm. The FSO approved visits below
this senior

management level, including visits with the technical
and engineering

staff; the trustees only reviewed documentation of
these visits

during their quarterly trustee meetings, if at all.
In addition,

when required, most post-visit contact reports lacked
the detail

needed for the trustees or DIS to determine what
was discussed

between the foreign-owned company and the owners'
representatives. 

Trustee inattention to contact at the technical level
is of

particular concern, since that is where most of the
U.S. defense

contractor's technology is located, not in the board
room where

senior management officials are found. <p>
Trustees rarely visited or toured the foreign-owned
company's

facility to observe the accessibility of classified
or

export-controlled information, except during prearranged
tours at the

time of their quarterly meetings. The trustees also
rarely

interviewed managerial and technical staff to verify
the level and

nature of their contact with employees of the foreign
parent firm. 

Government officials suggested that trustees at two
companies involve

themselves in a higher degree of monitoring. Some
flatly refused and

stated that they have held important positions in
government and

industry and feel that it is not their role to personally
provide

such detailed oversight. <p>
The ISR requires that proxy holders and trustees
of voting trusts

&quot;shall assume full responsibility for the voting
stock and for

exercising all management prerogatives relating thereto&quot;
and that the

foreign stockholders shall &quot;continue solely
in the status of

beneficiaries.&quot; However, as an example of minimal
proxy involvement,

at one proxy company the three proxy holders only
met twice a year. 

Only one of the three proxy holders was on the company's
board of

directors, and the board had not met in person for
4 years. All

board action was by telephone, and the board's role
was limited to

electing company officers. The proxy holders' were
minimally

involved in selecting and approving these company
officials. The

parent firm selected the current chief executive
officer (CEO) of the

company and the proxy holders affirmed this selection
after

questioning the parent firm about the individual's
background. The

FSO was required to approve all visits to this firm
by employees of

the foreign parent rather than the proxy holders
as required by the

ISR. <p>
At the company we reviewed operating under an MOA,
the Defense

Security Committee consists of four company officials
and the three

outside members. These outside members visited the
company only for

the quarterly committee meetings. The president of
the company, who

is also the security committee chairman, set the
meeting agenda and

conducted the meetings. Further, his presentations
to the outside

members usually focused on current and future business
activities

rather than security matters. Any plant tours the
outside members

received were prearranged and concurrent with the
quarterly meetings. 

There were no off-cycle visits to the company to
inspect or monitor

security operations. <BR>

<B>Foreign Owners Acted in Capacity Beyond That of Beneficiaty in Proxy Firms</B><br>

----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 4:2<p>
To eliminate the risks associated with foreign control
and influence

over foreign-owned U.S. defense contractors, the
ISR requires that

voting trust and proxy agreements &quot;unequivocally
shall provide for

the exercise of all prerogatives of ownership by
the trustees with

complete freedom to act independently without consultation
with,

interference by, or influence from foreign stockholders.&quot;
<p>
Further,<p>
&quot;the trustees shall assume full responsibility
for the voting

stock and for exercising all management prerogatives
relating

thereto in such a way as to ensure that the foreign

stockholders, except for the approvals just enumerated,
[sale,

merger, dissolution of the company; encumbrance of
stock; filing

for bankruptcy] shall be insulated from the cleared
facility and

continue solely in the status of beneficiaries.&quot;
<p>
However, at one of the proxy firms we reviewed, the
foreign owners

acted in more than the status of beneficiaries. The
proxy firm's

strategic plan and annual budget were regularly presented
to the

foreign owners for review. At least once the foreign
parent firm

rejected a strategic plan and indicated that it would
continue to

object until the plan specified increased collaboration
between the

proxy firm and the foreign parent firm. At another
time, the foreign

owners had employees of this U.S. firm represent
them in an attempt

to acquire another U.S. aerospace firm more than
10 times the size

of the proxy firm. Although decisions on mergers
are within the

rights of the foreign owners, during this acquisition
effort,

officers and employees of the U.S. defense contractor
were operating

at the direction of the foreign owners. In this case,
because the

parent firm directed staff of the proxy firm, it
clearly acted as

more than a beneficiary, the role to which foreign
owners are limited

under the ISR. <p>
Another proxy firm has a distribution agreement with
its foreign

owners that restricts the proxy firm to marketing
electronic

equipment and services to the U.S. government. In
addition, the

agreement will only allow the proxy firm to service
hardware that is

used on classified systems. Although this distribution
agreement was

approved by DIS at the time of the foreign acquisition,
it controls

the strategic direction of the proxy firm. The proxy
firm reported

to DIS that it is important for the survival of the
U.S. company to

be able to pursue business opportunities that are
currently denied by

the distribution agreement. <BR>
<p>
<B>Some Foreign-Owned Firms are Financially Dependent on Foreign Owners</B><br>
----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 4:3<p>
The ISR states that a company operating under a proxy
agreement

&quot;shall be organized, structured, and financed
so as to be capable of

operating as a viable business entity independent
from the foreign

stockholders.&quot; During our review, we saw examples
of firms that

depended on their foreign owners for financial support
or had

business arrangements with the foreign owners that
degraded the

independence of the proxy firm. <p>
The president of one company operating under a proxy
agreement told

us that his company was basically bankrupt. His company
is financed

by banks owned by the government where the parent
company is

incorporated. The company's foreign parent firm guarantees
the

loans, and two of the government banks are on the
parent firm's board

of directors. The foreign owners paid several million
dollars to the

U.S. company to relocate one of its divisions. According
to

officials of the U.S. company, they could not otherwise
have

afforded such a move, nor could they have obtained
bank loans on

their own. <p>
Another proxy firm had loans from the foreign owners
that grew to

exceed the value of the proxy firm. One proxy holder
said the

company would probably have gone out of business
without the loans. 

Even with the loans, the company's financial position
was precarious. 

It was financially weak, could not obtain independent
financing, and

was considerably burdened by making interest payments
on its debt to

the foreign owners. During our review, a DIS official
acknowledged

that DIS should have addressed the risk imposed by
this indebtedness. <BR>
<p>
<B>Some Trustees Have Appearance of Conflicts of Interest</B><br>

----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 4:4<p>
Under the ISR provisions, voting trustees and proxy
holders &quot;shall be

completely disinterested individuals with no prior
involvement with

either the facility or the corporate body in which
it is located, or

the foreign interest.&quot; At one of the companies
we reviewed, a proxy

holder was previously involved as a director of a
joint venture with

the foreign owners. These foreign owners later nominated
this

individual to be their proxy holder. He withheld
the information

about his prior involvement from DIS at the time
he became a proxy

holder. After DIS became aware of this relationship,
it concluded

that this individual was ineligible to be a proxy
holder and should

not continue in that role. Thereafter, the Assistant
Secretary of

Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and
Intelligence wrote

to the company about irregularities in proxy agreement

implementation, such as allowing the foreign owners
prerogatives that

were not allowed under the proxy agreement. However,
he did not

address the appearance of a conflict of interest,
and the individual

has remained as a proxy holder. <p>
This same proxy holder is also now the part-time
CEO of the

foreign-owned U.S. defense firm and received an annual
compensation

of approximately $272,000 (as compared to the $50,000
proxy holder

stipend) for an average of 8 days' work per month
in his dual role of

CEO and proxy holder. This appears to be a second
conflict of

interest: as CEO his fiduciary duty and loyalty to
the foreign-owned

company takes primacy; as proxy holder, his primary
responsibility is

to protect DOD's information security interests.
<p>
In addition, at this company, the conflict between
the proxy holders'

responsibility to DOD and their perceived fiduciary
responsibility

was illustrated during a DIS investigation into possible
violations

of the proxy agreement. Citing their fiduciary responsibility,
the

proxy holders refused to allow DIS investigators
to interview

employees without company supervision. The Assistant
Secretary of

Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and
Intelligence found

this action to be contrary to the firm's contractual
obligations

under its security agreement with DOD. <p>
The company just discussed is not the only one where
a proxy holder

also holds the title of CEO. At another firm, the
proxy holder's

salary as CEO is approximately $113,000 (as compared
to the $22,000

proxy holder stipend). Again, there appears to be
a conflict of

interest because of the CEO's fiduciary duty and
loyalty to the

foreign-owned company, and his responsibility to
protect DOD's

information security interests. <p>
At another proxy firm, the lead proxy holder owns
a consulting firm

that has a contract with the foreign-owned U.S. company.
In this

case, there appears to be a conflict of interest
because as proxy

holder, his primary responsibility is to protect
the information

security interests of DOD, but as a consultant to
the foreign-owned

firm, it is in his interest to please the foreign-owned
company. <p>
At another firm, the agreement requires that the
outside members of

the security committee be independent of the foreign
investors and

their shareholders. The French government owns 12-1/4
percent of

this U.S. company. Even though the outside members
of the security

committee are to protect classified and export-controlled
information

from this foreign government, one outside member
created the

appearance of a conflict of interest by representing
a French

government-owned firm before DOD in its efforts to
buy another

cleared U.S. defense contractor. This outside member
also created

the appearance of a conflict of interest when his
consulting firm

became the Washington representative for a French
government-owned

firm in its export control matters with the State
Department. <p>
Finally, the ISR does not expressly require that
outside directors

serving under an SSA comply with the independence
standards

applicable to voting trustees and proxy holders.
The reason for this

omission is not clear. However, all of the SSAs we
reviewed stated

that individuals appointed as outside directors can
have &quot;no prior

employment or contractual relationship&quot; with
the foreign owners. 

Since the outside directors perform the same function
as voting

trustees and proxy holders in ensuring the protection
of classified

information and the continued ability of the cleared
U.S. company to

perform on classified contracts, it seems reasonable
that they should

also be disinterested parties when named to the board
and should

remain free of other involvement with the foreign
owners during their

period of service. <BR>
<p>
<B>DIS Inspections Did Not Focus on Foreign Ownership Issues</B><br>

----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 4:5<p>
DIS inspectors told us that their inspections of
foreign-owned U.S. 

defense contractors vary little from the type of
facility security

inspections they do at U.S.-owned facilities. Their
inspections

concentrated on such items as classified document
storage, amount and

usage of classified information, and the number of
cleared personnel

and their continuing need for clearances. <p>
During the time of our review, DIS developed new
guidelines for

inspections of foreign-owned firms by its industrial
security staff

to specifically address foreign ownership issues.
They call for the

inspectors to examine issues such as changes to the
insulating

agreement, business relationships between the U.S.
company and its

foreign owners, foreign owner involvement in the
U.S. company's

strategic direction, the number and nature of contacts
with

representatives of the foreign owners, and the number
of foreign

staff working at the facility. These guidelines were
promulgated in

September 1994. <p>
DIS is beginning to implement the new inspection
guidelines. 

According to DIS officials at the regional and field
office levels,

before they use the new guidelines, they must educate
the inspection

staff on foreign ownership issues as well as how
the issues should be

addressed during their inspections. They also said
that implementing

these new inspection procedures would probably double
the length of

an inspection at the foreign-owned facilities. <p>
Currently, DIS must inspect each cleared facility
twice a year, but

it is having difficulty maintaining this inspection
schedule. 

Industrial security inspectors are responsible for
around 70 cleared

facilities, and inspections at some larger facilities
take a number

of days. Doubling the inspection time at the foreign-owned

facilities under the new guidelines might require
some realignment of

DIS resources. According to DOD officials, DIS inspections
will

occur no more often than annually under the NISPOM.
<BR>
<p>
<B>Recommendations</B><br>

----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 4:6<p>
We recommend that the Secretary of Defense develop
and implement a

plan to improve trustee oversight and involvement
in the

foreign-owned companies and to ensure the independence
of

foreign-owned U.S. defense contractors and their
trustees from

improper influence from the foreign owners. As part
of this effort,

the Secretary should make the following changes in
the implementation

of the existing security arrangements and under the
National

Industrial Security Program. <p>
1. Visitation request approvals: The trustees should
strictly

adhere to the ISR visitation agreement provision
that requires them

to approve requests for visits between the U.S. defense
contractor

and representatives of its foreign owners. This duty
should not be

delegated to officers or employees of the foreign-owned
firm. <p>
2. Trustee monitoring: The trustees should be required
to ensure

that personnel of the foreign-owned firm document
and report the

substance of the discussions they hold with personnel
of the foreign

parent firm. The trustees should review these reports
and ensure

that the information provided is sufficient to determine
what

information passed between the parties during the
contact. The

trustees should also select at least a sample of
contacts and

interview the participants of the foreign-owned firm
to ensure that

the post-contact reports accurately reflect what
transpired. <p>
3. Trustee inspections: To more directly involve
trustees in

information security monitoring, the trustees should
annually

supervise an information security inspection of each
of the cleared

facilities. The results of these inspections should
be included in

the annual report to DIS. <p>
4. FSO supervision: To insulate the FSO from influence
by the

foreign-owned firm and its foreign owners, the trustees
should be

empowered and required to review and approve or disapprove
the

selection of the FSO and all decisions regarding
the FSO's pay and

continued employment. The trustees should also supervise
the FSO to

ensure an acceptable level of job performance, since
trustees are

charged with monitoring information security at the
U.S. defense

contractor. <p>
5. Financial independence: To monitor the financial
independence of

the foreign-owned firm, the annual report to DIS
should include a

statement on any financial support, loans, loan guarantees,
or debt

relief from or through the foreign owners or the
government of the

foreign owners that have occurred during the year.
<p>
6. Trustee independence: To help avoid conflicts
of interest for

the trustees, require them to certify at the time
of their selection,

and then annually, that they have no prior or current
involvement

with the foreign-owned firm or its foreign owners
other than their

trustee position. This certification should include
a statement that

they are not holding and will not hold positions
within the

foreign-owned company other than their trustee position.
It should

be expressly stated that these independence standards
apply equally

to voting trustees, proxy holders, and outside directors
of firms

under SSAs. <p>
7. Trustee duties: The selected trustees should be
required to sign

agreements acknowledging their responsibilities and
the specific

duties they are required to carry out those responsibilities,

including those in numbers 1 through 4. The agreement
should provide

that DOD can require the resignation of any trustee
if DOD determines

that the trustee failed to perform any of these duties.
This

agreement should ensure that the trustees and the
government clearly

understand what is expected of the trustees to perform
their security

roles. <BR>
<p>
<B>Agency Comments and our Evaluation</B><br>

----------------------------------------------------------<P>
Chapter 4:7<p>
DOD stated that it generally agreed with the thrust
of our

recommendations in this report, but did not agree
that the specific

actions we recommended were necessary, given DOD
efforts to address

the issues involved. DOD said it had addressed these
issues through

education, advice, and encouragement of trustees
to take the desired

corrective actions. We and DOD have both seen instances
in which

this encouragement has been rejected. Because of
the risk to

information with national security implications,
we believe that

requiring, rather than encouraging, the trustees
to improve security

oversight would be more effective. Therefore, we
continue to believe

our recommendations are valid and believe they should
be implemented

to reduce the security risks. <p>
DOD's comments and our evaluation are presented in
their entirety in

<p>
The following are GAO's comments on the Department
of Defense's (DOD)

letter dated April 14, 1995. <p>
GAO COMMENTS<p>
1. We have revised the draft report to reflect DOD's
comments on the

National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual
(NISPOM), the

Industrial Security Regulation (ISR), and visitation
agreements. <p>
2. Lawyers negotiating a new agreement may have significant

experience with foreign-owned firms operating under
these agreements. 

Five of the 14 firms we reviewed used the same lawyer.
Further,

visitation agreements signed before 1993 demonstrate
a trend toward

loosening controls. For example, an older visitation
agreement

associated with a proxy agreement stated: <p>
&quot;As a general rule, visits between the Foreign
Interest and the

cleared Corporation are not authorized; however,
the Proxy

Holders may approve visits in connection with regular
day-to-day

business operations pertaining strictly to purely
commercial

products or services and not involving classified
contracts or

executive direction or managerial matters.&quot;
<p>
In contrast, the comparable provision in a newer
visitation agreement

associated with a proxy agreement was less limiting:
<p>
&quot;As a general rule, visits between representatives
of the

Corporation and those of any Foreign Interest, are
not

authorized unless approved in advance by the designated
Proxy

Holder.&quot;<p>
According to DOD's comments, baseline visitation
controls were

developed in 1993. At that time, visitation agreements
ceased to

exist as separate documents. The visitation controls
are now a

section of the voting trust, proxy agreement, and
special security

agreement (SSA). The terms of each agreement type
continue to be

negotiable. <p>
3. The acquisition of a U.S. defense contractor by
a foreign

interest can present a higher degree of risk to export-controlled

information than other international involvement.
In international

cooperative programs and joint ventures, the U.S.
firm maintains an

arms-length relationship with the foreign interests.
That is not the

case with foreign ownership, when the foreign owner
has control or

influence over the U.S. firm and access to the U.S.
contractor's

facilities. The risk of control and influence inherent
in foreign

ownership is justification for DOD's special foreign
ownership,

control, or influence (&lt;strong&gt;FOCI&lt;/strong&gt;)
controls. However, the

controls used to

protect unclassified export-controlled information
are limited. 

Although some of the newer SSAs we reviewed required
the protection

of export-controlled information, most of the agreements
did not. 

Further, as we reported and DOD acknowledges, the
Defense

Investigative Service (DIS) does not review the protection
of

unclassified export-controlled information. In fact,
there is no

established means for the U.S. government to monitor
compliance and

ensure enforcement of federal regulations regarding
the transfer of

export-controlled technical information. <p>
4. None of the six SSAs we reviewed required DIS
to approve the

replacement of directors. However, the requirement
is included in

boilerplate SSA language that DOD told us it plans
to use in the

future. <p>
5. The terms of the distribution agreement were not
revised. After

negotiating with the proxy holders, the foreign owners
agreed to a

more liberal, &quot;case-by-case&quot; application
of the distribution

agreement. <p>
6. DIS oversight did not bring these two cases to
light. In both

instances, DIS was notified about these situations
some time after

they occurred. In the first case, DIS was given an
anonymous

allegation and then pursued it vigorously. In the
second case, the

proxy holders brought the complaint to DIS, and DIS
monitored the

proxy holder negotiations with the foreign owner.
<p>
7. Trustee approval of visitation requests need not
be onerous. 

This duty is typically carried out by a designated
company trustee

and involves the occasional receipt, review, and
transmittal of

approval requests by facsimile machine. Further,
at the companies we

reviewed, the trustees' time was not consumed ensuring
the economic

health of the company. The usual trustee involvement
was their

attendance at four meetings a year. In making this
recommendation,

we do not intend to discourage distinguished individuals
from

accepting appointments as trustees, but rather believe
that it would

be in the best interest of DOD to encourage individuals
who are

interested in being proactive trustees to accept
these positions. <p>
8. Our recommendation is not that the trustees supervise
&quot;each

inspection effort&quot; at the company, but that
they supervise an

inspection of each of the company's facilities annually.
We believe

it is a minimal requirement for the trustees to visit
each of the

company's facilities once a year to personally assess
security. <p>
9. The cited March 1995 &quot;policy change&quot;
is a positive step, but this

new approach is not documented in any DOD regulation,
directive, or

policy memorandum. Its only documentation is in the
DOD-approved

implementing procedures for one recently signed SSA.
Further, our

recommendation calls for trustee approval of all
decisions regarding

the facility security officer's (FSO) pay and continued
employment

and for trustee supervision of the FSO. Although
voting trustees and

proxy holders may be currently empowered to review
and approve or

disapprove the FSO's selection, they are not required
to do so and

could delegate this responsibility. <p>
10. Any involvement the trustees have with the foreign
owners after

their initial certification may not be reported to
DOD unless the

trustee in question heeds the advice of DIS to report
such

activities. We believe an annual certification, which
should not be

onerous, will prevent inadvertent disclosure omissions.
<p>
11. The &quot;Acknowledgement of Obligations&quot;
portion of the

&lt;strong&gt;FOCI&lt;/strong&gt;

agreements is too broad and general to clearly identify
the trustees'

responsibilities in carrying out their security role.
Trustees'

certification of acknowledgement of the broad and
general obligations

cited in the &lt;strong&gt;FOCI&lt;/strong&gt; agreement
will do little to ensure

that trustees

will play an active role in security oversight. Further,
although

DIS educational efforts may encourage some trustees
to pay greater

attention to the security aspects of their role,
we feel that the

agreement we are recommending will provide baseline
performance

criteria for all trustees. <p>
12. Following their 1993 survey of foreign-owned
U.S. defense

contractors, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)
and DIS reported

the following: <p>
&quot;Most agreements are silent on the authority
of the DOD to

terminate the arrangement or to dismiss a Proxy Holder,
Trustee

or outside director. While DIS is normally a party
to Special

Security Agreements, it is not a party to proxy or
trust

agreements and therefore lacks standing to intercede
when

appropriate.&quot;<p>
While DIS is a party to SSAs, if faced with outside
directors who are

not performing their security duties, the only means
for DIS to force

corrective action would be to terminate the agreement,
thereby

causing the company to lose its clearance, and halting
all the

company's work on classified contracts. Our recommendation
is a more

moderate way of removing a nonperforming trustee
than revoking a

company's clearance and terminating its classified
contracts. We

modified our recommendation in recognition of DOD's
comment that the

shareholder must remove a trustee director. <BR>

<HR>
<P>
The DIS mainframe computer is scheduled to be moved
to a new location in the Baltimore, Maryland area in June 1996.
The move 

is scheduled to begin at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight
Time, on June 11, and it is scheduled to be completed by early
morning 

June 17.<BR>

<P>
This means that DISCO will not be able to take any
computer actions on June 12, 13 and 14. No security clearances
will be 

granted on these three days nor will DISCO be able
to respond to any status inquiries. If contractors have administrative

questions during these three days, such as how to
obtain copies of the SF 86, they should call (614) 692-1389 or
(614) 692-2253.
<P>
We ask for you cooperation and understanding during
this change.<BR>

<HR>
<P>
On February 1, 1996, the following letter was mailed
to all cleared contractor sites in the Far East and their respective
HOF FSO's:<BR>

<P>
Dear Far East Contractor:<BR>

<P>
Effective May 1, 1996, the Pacific Region, Defense
Investigative Service (DIS), specifically the San Diego Industrial
Security Field Office will assume industrial security support
responsibilities for the operations of cleared contractors in
the Far East. The DIS Office of Industrial Security International,
Far East (OISI-FE), Camp Zama, Japan will be disestablished.<BR>

<P>
This decision was based on the agency's efforts to
consolidate and streamline existing field operations. It should
not be construed as a lessening of commitment to the overseas
contractor community but a response to mandated downsizing and
budget reduction initiatives within the federal government. (Contractors
assigned to Pacific Air Force (PACAF) installations, i.e., Yokota,
Misawa, Osan, etc. will continue to fall under the industrial
security cognizance of their respective Air Force Information
Security Program Manager [ISPM].)<BR>

<P>
The mailing address and particulars for the San Diego
Industrial Security Field Office are as follows:<BR>

<P>
Defense Investigative Service
<P>
Industrial Security Field Office (S53SD)
<P>
16885 W. Bernardo Drive, Suite 150
<P>

<HR>
<P>
<B>THE OFFICE OF INDUSTRIAL SECURITY INTERNATIONAL,
FAR EAST</B>
<P>
The Office of Industrial Security International,
Far East, commonly referred to as &quot;OISI-FE,&quot; is a field
extension of the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) Directorate
of Industrial Security. The principal office is currently located
on Camp Zama, Japan, headquarters of the U.S. Army Japan/9th TAACOM.

<P>
OISI-FE operates under the directional guidance and
control of the Deputy Director (Industrial Security). The Director,
OISI-FE is responsible for administering the overseas aspects
of the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) in accordance
with established policies, regulations and procedures in a geographic
area encompassing the Pacific Rim and Australia.
<P>
OISI-FE's primary responsibility is to provide ongoing
security advise and assistance to cleared U.S. contractors' overseas
operations and the cleared personnel they employ. This encompasses
contractor duty stations within its geographic area of responsibility
performing on classified contracts on U.S. Army and Navy installations.
It also includes contractor duty stations not located on a U.S.
Government installation and/or not performing on a classified
contract. These locations include marketing and liaison (business
development) representatives for cleared contractors as well as
overseas personnel performing on classified Foreign Military Sales
(FMS) programs, classified foreign contracts, classified co-development
or co-production programs, or other joint classified programs
with allied countries which require a U.S. security clearance.
<P>
OISI-FE is also the office of record for personnel
security clearance and security assistance data on U.S. citizens
assigned overseas for a period of 90 days or more. When requested
this information is provided as a service to regional U.S. Military,
law enforcement and investigative activities in the Far East.
As one would suspect, the Director, OISI-FE routinely interfaces
with representatives of the U.S. Department of State, Department
of Justice and U.S. Customs as it relates to DIS' overseas security
mission.
<P>
In addition, if called upon, OISI-FE assists industry
representatives with the processing of visit requests to U.S.
Government activities, foreign government activities and to foreign
firms, arranges secure transmission channels and storage facilities
for classified material and conducts security briefings and orientations
which may be required in special situations.
<P>
Approximately 300 overseas sites fall under the industrial
security cognizance of OISI-FE. Approximately 80 percent of these
are located in either Japan or South Korea. The majority of individuals
assigned to these locations provide technical assistance to the
U.S. Military in such areas as computer design and maintenance,
battle simulation training and theater logistics.
<P>
On a recurring basis, representative/s of OISI-FE
visits these sites to determine the adequacy of security procedures
and safeguards in-place. The overall intent of these security
reviews and advice and assistance actions is to ensure that U.S.
classified information and materials entrusted to civilian personnel
are safeguarded in accordance with National Industrial Security
Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) requirements and that the personnel
involved are cognizant of their responsibilities in this area.

<P>
For contractors operating in an overseas environment,
there are unique security vulnerabilities: In many respects, OISI-FE
augments the role of the Home Office Facility Security Officer
for those individuals who are cut-off from the watchful eye of
their firm's full time security staff and who are considered a
security risk by virtue of their overseas status and technical
expertise. 
<P>
It is OISI-FE's responsibility to continually remind
those at highest risk, the men and women at contractor sites around
the world, that the intelligence efforts of both friendly and
adversarial nations are as active today as they have been in the
past. And, that is far easier to obtain restricted technology
overseas than it is in the United States due to the accessibility
of foreign nationals brought on my today's emerging investment
opportunities.
<P>
The Pacific Rim represents the fastest growing economic
region in the world. The thirst for western technology is unprecedented
imposing a unique challenge to America's technological supremacy.
Our greatest challenge in the 90's and beyond is to protect our
advanced technology from unauthorized disclosure from individuals
and governments whose interests are often incompatible with the
national security of the United States. To counter this threat,
OISI-FE assists industry in developing and maintaining a cohesive,
threat-appropriate overseas industrial security program.

<HR>
<H3>DTIRP Security Information Bulletin No. 2</H3>
<P>
 
<P>
Special Access Visits (SAVs) under the Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty (START)
<P>
 
<P>
The United States Government is preparing to implement
the START Treaty. One of the many protocols to the Treaty

concerned with verification includes the right for
any party (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, or the U.S.)
to request a

Special Right of Access Visit (SAV) to any facility
in order to resolve a Treaty compliance concern. The inspected
party has

the option to either accept the proposed SAV or propose
an alternative method to resolve the concern.
<P>
 
<P>
A SAV request that is directed at a declared START-related
facility in the U.S. will be easier to respond to than one

involving an undeclared facility because declared
facilities have inspection readiness plans in place. However,
a SAV request might also

identify a non-Treaty related area of the facility.
A request for a SAV at an undeclared facility will require a preliminary

assessment of the potential disclosure risks of the
facility.  The START Compliance Review Group (CRG) is responsible
for

carrying out the assessment process and providing
a recommended response to the SAV request for the Department of
Defense (DoD). The CRG is comprised of senior officials
representing acquisition and technology, policy, legal, the Joint

Chiefs of Staff, security and counterintelligence
interests, and when appropriate, representatives from the Army,
Navy, Air
Force, On-Site Inspection Agency or other DoD agencies.
<P>
 

In its review, the CRG will pay particular attention
to the type of activities which occur at the facility and the
extent of known

classified/sensitive operations or programs. Depending
upon the amount and type of information available to the DoD,
the facility

may be requested to provide additional information
or to update relevant information in a very short timeframe. The
CRG may

decide, after consultation with company management,
to send a Site Assessment Team (SAT) to the facility to help the
company

assess its potential disclosure risks relating to
classified, proprietary and other sensitive information; to gather
information

on whether or how a SAV could be performed; and to
develop alternate means of resolving the compliance concern.
<P>
 

Should the U.S. decide to grant the request for the
SAV, the CRG may dispatch a Site Preparation Team (SPT), if necessary,

to assist an undeclared facility in preparing for
the SAV. Typical preparation activities could include: identifying
classified,

sensitive and proprietary programs, activities, and
information that should be protected; developing and applying
protective

countermeasures (such as shrouding and inspection
route planning); training facility escorts to assist DoD escorts
as well

as management representatives on the inspection process;
and conducting a mock inspection. The Office of the Under Secretary

of Defense (OUSD) will either lead these teams or
may appoint the Army, Navy or Air Force to do so.
<P>
 

In contrast to other types of START inspections,
there are no Treaty procedures governing a SAV. The U.S. and the
concerned

Party will negotiate access procedures that are needed
to resolve the compliance concern while minimizing the risk of
disclosing

unrelated information. Relevant provisions of the
Treaty's Inspection Protocol may be used, such as the procedures
for the

inspection of covered objects and restricting access
to and within structures based on the dimensions of the item of
concern. 
<P>
DTIRP security countermeasures personnel and resources
are available to the SAT and the SPT upon request of the Team

Leader.
<P>
 

For more information on START Special Access Visits,
please contact OUSD(A&amp;T)/S&amp;SS/SAC&amp;C at (703) 695-7840.
<P>
 For information on arms control security countermeasures,
contact the OSIA DTIRP Outreach Program at 1-800-293-3787.

<B>Section 1 - GENERAL<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>1.1 OBJECTIVE<BR>
</B>
<P>
The objective of this Automated Information
System Security Plan (AISSP) is to provide the Security instructions
and procedures that will be used by each <B>YOUR COMPANY NAME</B>
Automated Information System (AIS) approved to process Department
of Defense (DoD) classified data. This document delineates procedures
to protect against two distinct types of vulnerabilities: (1)
Unauthorized disclosure, destruction or modification of classified
information, and (2) Unauthorized manipulation of the AIS network
and individual AIS components.  Re-approval of this AISSP may
be required under the conditions mandated in Section 1.7.  <BR>

<P>
<B>1.2 AUTHORITY AND SCOPE<BR>
</B>
<P>
Authority - Department of Defense 5220.22-M,
<I>National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual</I> (NISPOM),
Chapter 8, &quot;Automated Information System Security&quot;<BR>

<P>
Scope - The policy, guidelines, techniques
and procedures contained herein are intended to be used by<B>
</B>user and support personnel associated with those AIS approved
to process classified data.  Each approved AIS will have an individual
addendum to this document.  Addendums for all AIS approved to
process classified data will be provided to the Cognizant Security
Agency (CSA).  Users and support personnel are also obligated
by the provisions of <B>YOUR COMPANY&iacute;s</B> Policy on computer
security which includes the commitment to protect classified information,
adhering to applicable requirements and disciplinary actions for
those that violate the requirements.<BR>

<P>
<B>1.3 RESPONSIBILITIES<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Information Systems Security Representative
(ISSR) is the representative from the AIS Section of the <B>YOUR
COMPANY</B> Security Department who is designated by the Facility
Security Officer (FSO).  The ISSR is responsible for the overall
AIS security program within <B>YOUR COMPANY</B> and is the principal
adviser concerning AIS security functions.  The ISSR shall ensure
that applicable DoD and <B>YOUR COMPANY</B> policies and directives
are observed and that conflicts of interest, responsibilities,

<P>
 l) Approve and document additional
AIS operated in the Dedicated Security Mode that are essentially
the same as those described in the AISSP and addendums; and
<P>
 m) Approve and document additional
and replacement components of a Dedicated or System High AIS that
are identical in functionality and do not affect the security
of the AIS.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
An AIS Security Custodian (AISSC) will
be appointed by the management of each program requiring a classified
AIS.  This appointment shall be in writing to and with the concurrence
of the ISSR.  The AISSC is responsible for the day-to-day functioning
of AIS security procedures in accordance with this document and
for the preparation and maintenance of the addendum for that specific
AIS .  In general, the responsibilities of the AISSC are: <BR>
<ul>
<P>
 a) General supervision, administration
and overall coordination of secure AIS security within the designated
facility or system;<BR>

<P>
 b) Ensuring that the AIS specific
addendum to this document and any other security instructions
are prepared, approved by the ISSR as required, issued and maintained;
<BR>

<P>
 c) Monitoring the implementation of
such instructions and procedures and initiating appropriate action
to remedy security deficiencies;<BR>

<P>
 d) Ensuring that all AIS users and
support personnel are initially briefed and periodically re-indoctrinated,
at least annually, on security requirements, procedures, and responsibilities;
<BR>

<P>
 e) Reporting and assisting in the
investigating of security violations or infractions and system
anomalies in secure AIS operation; and<BR>

<P>
 f) Ensuring that the audit reviews
specified in the document are accomplished and documented.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
<B>1.4 MODE OF OPERATION<BR>
</B>
<P>
AIS&iacute; identified in the addendums
to this AISSP will operate in the Dedicated Security Mode which
necessitates that all personnel with access to the AIS have both
a security clearance and need-to-know for <U>all</U> classified
information contained in the systems.<BR>

<P>
<B>1.5 CLASSIFICATION LEVEL<BR>
</B>
<P>
AIS&iacute; identified in the addendums
to this AISSP may handle and process data up to and including
the TOP SECRET level, although most AIS&iacute; will process at
the SECRET level.  The specific level for each AIS will be identified
in its addendum.  Personnel clearances, physical security, and
other precautions shall be in keeping with the requisite safeguards
for the level identified.<BR>

<P>
<B>1.6 SUMMARY OF SYSTEM USAGE<BR>
</B>
<P>
Classified processing may include,
but not be limited to, modeling, engineering design and analysis,
trajectory/flight simulation, graphics display, software development,
testing, word processing and other stated purposes.  The specifics
for each AIS, to include system configuration, hours of operation,
physical controls, etc., will be stated in the addendum for that
AIS.  Approval for an AIS to process at the TOP SECRET level will
be coordinated with the CSA.<BR>

<P>
<B>1.7 AUTHORIZATION<BR>
</B>
<P>
Authorization to conduct classified
operations on an AIS is granted by the ISSR and generally based
upon providing to the ISSR the data required in the addendum.
 Authorization to conduct classified operations will immediately
cease on AIS identified in the addendums to this AISSP and re-accreditation
required, under the following conditions:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
 a) Major changes in personal access
requirements;
<P>
 b) Relocation, modification of the
AIS;
<P>
 c) Additions, deletions or changes
to hardware configuration that impact approved security controls;
<P>
 d) Software changes impacting security
protection features;
<P>
 e) Changes in clearance, sanitization
or maintenance procedures;
<P>
 f) Other conditions directed by the
ISSR or the CSA.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
Continuing with classified operations
under the above conditions is a violation of DoD standards and
could result in disciplinary action for the AISSC.  Because some
lead time may be required to provide re-accreditation, it is strongly
recommended that the ISSR be notified as soon as possible if one
of the above conditions is anticipated.  
<P>
<B>Section 2 -SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>2.0 GENERAL<BR>
</B>
<P>
This section describes the documenting,
controlling, changing and record keeping for AIS hardware and
software.  Prior to initial accreditation, the AISSC for the AIS
shall provide the ISSR with an inventory (baseline) of the hardware,
software, etc., that will be used with the AIS during classified
processing.  This inventory shall be included in the addendum
to the AIS.  The AISSC shall ensure that these inventories are
maintained in a current status and available for review by the
ISSR or CSA.  See the sections below for specific detailed requirements.
<BR>

<P>
The ISSR may approve the addition of
like components/equipment to a previously approved system providing
they do not impact any security features of the system and can
be operated and declassified using existing procedures.  The ISSR
may also approve new AIS, provided that they are similar in equipment,
configuration and security features to previously approved AIS.
 <BR>

<P>
<B>2.1 HARDWARE (H/W)<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>2.1.1 AIS H/W Inventory and Configuration
Management<BR>
</B>
<P>
A general inventory for each AIS will
be included in the addendum for that AIS.  This inventory will
minimally reflect the following:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
 a) Nomenclature/model number of the
major AIS components, to include the vendors&iacute; name; 
<P>
 b) Retentive capability (type memory
or storage) of these components;
<P>
 c) The quantity of each item; and
<P>
 d) A block diagram schematic showing
the interconnection of the major hardware components and any external
links.  <BR>
</ul>
<P>
The AISSC shall maintain in a current
status a more detailed inventory of the hardware approved for
classified processing.  In addition to the data shown above, this
inventory shall include the unique identification number (serial
number, inventory number or other unique identification system)
for each component in the AIS and its location within the AIS.
 This includes, but is not limited to:  CPUs, tape drives or storage
devices, terminals, keyboards with retentive capability, special
test equipment, etc.<BR>

<P>
<B>2.1.2 Addition of Hardware<BR>
</B>
<P>
If hardware is to be added to an accredited
AIS, this must be coordinated with the ISSR prior to the hardware
being installed or connected to the accredited AIS.  The ISSR
may approve the addition of hardware to the existing AIS under
the following two (2) conditions:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
 (a) They do not impact any security
features of the AIS, and
<P>

</ul>
<P>
If the hardware to be added does not
meet the above conditions, the ISSR shall obtain the necessary
accreditation from the CSA.<BR>

<P>
Addition of the hardware shall documented
on an AIS Maintenance Report (refer to Appendix A).  The AISSC
shall also update the general inventory listing  provided to the
ISSR and the detailed listing maintained by the AISSC.  <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>2.1.3 Removal of Hardware<BR>
</B>
<P>
If hardware is to be removed from the
AIS, this must be coordinated with the ISSR prior to the hardware
leaving the protected environment so the ISSR can verify that
the hardware was properly sanitized.  The AISSC shall ensure that
the hardware was sanitized properly utilizing the procedures stipulated
in this document or the addendum and shall complete an AIS Maintenance
Report.  This report will be  filed with the other records maintained
for the AIS and retained in accordance with Section 4.  <BR>

<P>
<B>2.2 SOFTWARE<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>2.2.1 AIS S/W Inventory and Configuration
Management<BR>
</B>
<P>
An inventory of the software (Operating
System and major Applications) used for each AIS will be included
in the addendum for that AIS.  This inventory will minimally reflect
the following:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
 a) Nomenclature of the software;
<P>
 b) Name of vendor;
<P>
 c) its general use (e.g., word processing,
flight S/W, simulation S/W, etc.)  <BR>
</ul>
<P>
The AISSC shall maintain a more detailed
inventory of the software approved for classified processing that
shall, in addition to the above items, reflect the current version
number.  <BR>

<P>
<B>2.2.2 Addition of Software<BR>
</B>
<P>
If software is to installed on an accredited
AIS, this must be coordinated with the ISSR prior to the software
being installed on or used for classified processing.  The ISSR
may approve the addition of software to the existing AIS provided
it does not impact any security features of the AIS.  If the software
does impact the security features, the ISSR shall obtain the necessary
accreditation from the CSA.<BR>

<P>
Addition of S/W shall documented on
an AIS Maintenance Report (refer to Appendix A).  The AISSC shall
also update the general S/W inventory listing  provided to the
ISSR and the detailed S/W listing maintained by the AISSC.  <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>2.2.3 Protection of Software<BR>
</B>
<P>
To ensure AIS integrity, all software
products (Operating System, Applications and special purpose utilities),
which are to be used for classified processing, shall, from the
earliest feasible time, be maintained in an approved secure storage
container.  Either the original vendor media, or a created copy
shall be write-protected and marked &quot;Protect as Secret&quot;
if it contains only unclassified data.  If the media cannot be
write-protected or is written to with classified data, it shall
be marked and physically controlled as any other classified document.
 Software from unknown or questionable sources shall not be used
on an AIS accredited for classified processing unless that S/W
has been fully reviewed prior to its use on the AIS and that review
documented on an AIS Maintenance Report.  <BR>

<P>
 CD ROM-Read Only disks do not require
any special security markings if they are unclassified and removed
from the immediate area of the accredited AIS.  Write Once/Read
Many (WORM) disks received from vendors must be marked and physically
controlled as any other classified document, if they contain classified
information.<BR>

<P>
S/W modifications to an accredited
AIS will not be done unless these modifications are executed as
outlined in their respective vendor guides or through quality
assurance standards for <B>YOUR COMPANY</B> developed S/W.  These
modifications shall also be protected as soon as practical after
receipt or development.<BR>

<P>
<B>2.2.4 Viruses and Malicious Code
<BR>
</B>
<P>
The AISSC shall be responsible for
ensuring that software is installed on the AIS, if available,
which will screen for viruses and eradicate as necessary.  For
Macintosh systems--Symantec's SAM or Central Point's Antivirus
are acceptable.  For DOS systems--McAffee's Virus Scan, Symantec's
Norton Antivirus (NAV) or Central Point's Anti-Virus are acceptable.
 Other virus detection or eradication software shall be coordinated
with the ISSR.  The virus detection and/or eradication S/W shall
be noted in the software listing in the addendum for the AIS.
 This S/W shall be handled in accordance with Section 2.2.3. 
<BR>

<P>
On other operating systems for which
virus detection and eradication S/W is not commercially available,
a thorough S/W validation and quality assurance process must be
conducted on S/W prior to its use during classified processing
periods.  The table below reflects methodologies that can be utilized
to review unclassified S/W that will be used during classified
processing.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Table 2.1 Software Review
Matrix</B></CENTER>
<P>
<IMG SRC="img00002.gif"><BR>
<P>
If a virus or other malicious code
is detected during a classified period, the AISSC and the ISSR
must be notified immediately.  Operations on the infected system
should be halted immediately and the AIS should be disconnected
from any other AIS.   The person discovering the virus or malicious
S/W shall document the following, as it relates to the incident:
<BR>
<ul>
<P>
 a) The observed symptoms;
<P>
 b) Any damage sustained;
<P>
 c) Identification of the media mounted
during the discovery;
<P>
 d) Identification of any network connections;
and
<P>
 e) The source of the virus or malicious
S/W.<BR>
<BR>
</ul>
<P>
<B>2.3 COMMUNICATIONS<BR>
</B>
<P>
Some approved AIS may require connection
to other approved AIS.  Connection may be accomplished via various
means, depending in part on the physical proximity of the AIS.
 These means can include: via protected transmission lines which
meet established physical criteria or via approved COMSEC/Cryptographic
circuits (e.g., STU III or KGs).  All connections between classified
AIS must be coordinated and approved by the ISSR who will obtain
any necessary authorizations from the CSA.  The means of communication
and the name/location of the connected activity for each approved
AIS shall be reflected in the addendum for that AIS.  The AISSC
shall be responsible for maintaining the currency of this information.
<BR>

<P>
Generally, networks are categorized
under the following network classes:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
 a) Unified Network: A connection of
two (2) or more AIS whose accreditation for classified processing
requires that all connected AIS&iacute; operate as a single accredited
network entity.<BR>

<P>
 b) Interconnected Network: A connection
of separately accredited AIS and/or Unified Networks, where each
self contained AIS retains its individual accreditation.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
Requests for accreditation of either
class of network must be coordinated with the ISSR.<BR>

<P>
<B>2.4 ACCESS CONTROLS<BR>
</B>
<P>
The term &quot;access&quot; is defined
as the ability and the means to approach, communicate with (input
to or receive output from), or otherwise make use of any material
or component in an AIS.  Positive controls shall be exercised
over all personnel having access to an AIS processing classified
data and the areas in which they reside.<BR>

<P>
<B>2.4.1 Granting Access<BR>
</B>
<P>
Personnel who administer and operate
the AIS must have a security clearance and need-to-know for the
highest classification, most restrictive type(s) of information
contained in the AIS or its areas at the time of<B> </B>their
access.<BR>

<P>
All<B> </B>clearances of assigned personnel,
contractor, and visiting personnel are maintained by the <B>YOUR
COMPANY&iacute;s</B> Security Office.  The AISSC shall verify
that the personnel desiring access to the accredited AIS have
the appropriate DoD security clearance necessary for the AIS or
its area.  Need-to-know shall be determined by program/project
management, prior to granting access to the AIS or prior to the
release of classified information.  <BR>

<P>
Prior to granting access to the AIS,
the AISSC shall brief the user on relevant security procedures
for the AIS and accomplish an AIS Briefing Form (Appendix D).
 This form shall be retained by the AISSC and be available for
review by the ISSR and/or CSA.  Completion of this form is a pre-requisite
to the AISSC adding the user to the &igrave;Authorized Users Listing
or Closed Area Listing.&quot;  A current &igrave;Authorized Users
Listing or Closed Area Listing&quot; shall be maintained at all
times and the AISSC shall also maintain previous listings in order
to provide the capability to determine who was an authorized user
within the audit trail retention period, as specified in Section
4 of this document.  At a minimum, user briefing shall include:
<BR>
<ul>
<P>
  a) Review of the AISSP and its appropriate
addendum to include classified operations, configuration control
requirements, S/W integrity requirements, upgrading and downgrading
procedures and audit trail requirements.  The AISSC will provide
the user with a copy of the AISSP and the AIS addendum; 
<P>
 b) Any physical procedures established
for the AIS area (e.g., procedures for alarming the area);
<P>
 c) Reporting requirements (e.g., violations,
AIS anomalies, deactivation of terminated users, etc.).<BR>
</ul>
<P>
All users with access to the AIS shall
be rebriefed by the AISSC when there are significant changes to
the security features or procedures and/or as determined by the
ISSR.<BR>

<P>
<B>2.4.2 Terminating Access<BR>
</B>
<P>
Whenever a user with access to an approved
AIS no longer requires access to the AIS, as a result of termination,
transfer, etc., the user or the user&iacute;s supervisor will
be responsible for notifying the AISSC of the change in status.
 The AISSC shall ensure that the user is deleted from AIS access
lists (manual or automated) and ensure that the users account
on the system has been disabled and applicable files transferred
to another authorized user.<BR>

<P>
<B>2.4.3 Maintenance Personnel<BR>
</B>
<P>
Maintenance personnel requiring access
to any part or component of an AIS accredited for classified operations,
which could affect or modify the secure operations of the AIS
or permit access to classified data or information, shall have
a personnel security clearance and need-to-know commensurate with
the classified information contained in the accredited AIS.<BR>

<P>
Should it become necessary for uncleared
maintenance personnel to access the AIS or the area housing the
accredited AIS, they shall be accompanied by a cleared, knowledgeable
escort designated for that purpose and be allowed access to system
components only after the AIS or, at a minimum, the component
to be worked on has been sanitized.  <BR>

<P>
If maintenance cannot be performed
during unclassified periods, the maintenance technician will not
be allowed to have &quot;hands-on&quot; access to any part of
the system that would allow access to classified information.
 No keyboard interaction is allowed by the uncleared maintenance
personnel unless escorts can monitor and authorize each interaction.
 Printed output and CRT displays will be verified as unclassified
before being shown to the uncleared maintenance person.  No diagnostic
equipment or software will be mounted on the accredited AIS or
permitted in the area of the AIS without the prior approval of
the AISSC and the ISSR.  Remote diagnostics for an AIS in the
classified mode are not authorized.<BR>

<P>
All maintenance performed on the system
must be documented on the AIS Maintenance Report (Appendix A).
 The AIS Maintenance Report must be maintained with the Audit
Trail records for twelve (12) months.  Note: AIS Maintenance Reports
which certify a sanitization action must be maintained for two
(2) years.<BR>

<P>
<B>2.4.4 Visitors Without Clearances
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Visitors without proper clearances,
when badged by the <B>YOUR COMPANY</B> Security Office, will have
access to  AIS areas only when escorted by a properly cleared
escort whose name appears on the access list.  Access will be
governed by the following procedures:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
 a) A current access roster, prepared
by the AISSC and authenticated by security, containing the name,
badge number and organization of each individual requiring unescorted
access to the AIS shall be maintained at the interior of all area
entrance(s).<BR>

<P>
 b) Personnel requiring access to the
computer facilities who are not approved for unescorted access
must be escorted at all times while within the area of the AIS
and must sign the Visitor Register.<BR>

<P>
 c) A written record (the Visitor Register)
shall be maintained of such escorted visits including the visitor's
name, date, time entered, time departed, purpose for visit, and
name and signature of the escort.<BR>

<P>
 d) It shall be the responsibility
of all persons whose name appears on the access list to escort
any individual who does not have the proper clearance or is not
on the AIS access list.  The escort will ensure that the visitor
is effectively denied access to classified information.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
<B>2.5 PHYSICAL SECURITY<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>2.5.1 AIS Facility<BR>
</B>
<P>
The physical spaces housing an AIS
accredited to process classified data shall provide sufficient
security to maintain continuous protection for the hardware. 
Protective safeguards must prevent or detect unauthorized or attempted
unauthorized access to the AIS area.  When the AIS is processing
classified data unattended or if classified information remains
in the AIS when it is unattended, the AIS must be located in an
approved &igrave;Closed Area.&icirc;  When an AIS is not in use
and all classified information has been removed and secured and
the AIS has been downgraded, continuous physical protection must
be in place to prevent or detect unauthorized modification of
the hardware or software.  This can be accomplished through one
or more of the following methods:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
 a) Continuous control and supervision
by authorized personnel (clearance and need-to-know;
<P>
 b) Use of approved storage containers
or areas (safes, Closed Areas, etc.)
<P>
 c) Through the use of AIS Protected
Areas that will prevent or detect tampering or theft of hardware/software.
<P>
 d) Through the use of security integrity
seals that will detect tampering or theft of internal components.
 Inspection of these seals is required before classified processing
is initiated.  If a seal is broken, classified processing shall
not be initiated until the AISSC has inspected the H/W for unauthorized
tampering.  The discovery of the broken seal and the required
inspection shall be documented on an AIS Maintenance Report.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
The appropriate physical security controls
will be determined by the <B>YOUR COMPANY</B> Security Department
depending on the nature of the AIS, its operation and its physical
location.  The type of physical control will be indicated in the
addendum for each approved AIS.  <B>YOUR COMPANY</B> Security
shall obtain CSA approval, as needed.<BR>

<P>
<B>2.5.2 Security Containers and Safeguards
<BR>
</B>
<P>
In order to provide the necessary storage,
configuration, material safeguards and security monitoring controls
for classified and &igrave;Protect as Secret&icirc; materials,
the following shall apply:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
 a) Appropriate containers for storage
of classified material up to and including the SECRET classification
shall be utilized.  Safes and storage containers for classified
material are those that are approved by Security in accordance
with the <B>YOUR COMPANY</B> Security Manual.  <BR>

<P>
 b) All classified and &igrave;Protect
as Secret&icirc; material shall be under the direct physical control
of a cleared, personnel with a need-to-know, unless the area has
been approved for the &igrave;open storage&icirc; of classified
material.  Classified removable media not involved in unattended
batch processing will normally not be left in an AIS, unless the
&igrave;Closed Area&icirc; housing the AIS has been approved for
&igrave;open storage.&icirc;  This &igrave;open storage&icirc;
status shall be reflected in the addendum for the AIS.  <BR>

<P>
 c) The security guard force checks
&igrave;Closed Area&icirc; space conditions during periods of
vacancy.  As part of this role the guard force will check, during
non working hours, for security violations which fall into the
following categories:<BR>
</ul>
<P>
 &iuml; Closed Area perimeter integrity
<BR>

<P>
 &iuml; Unauthorized personnel in the
Closed Area<BR>

<P>
<B>Section 3 - OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Operations in the classified environment
will be maintained to preclude unauthorized (accidental or intentional)
disclosure, destruction or modification of classified information
and the compromise of classified information.  In accomplishing
the foregoing, the procedures, guidelines, and controls of this
AISSP and accompanying addendums must be followed.<BR>

<P>
<B>3.1 UPGRADING AND DOWNGRADING<BR>
</B>
<P>
The term &igrave;upgrading&icirc; is
defined as a process whereby an AIS and its immediate physical
environment is adjusted to facilitate the processing of classified
information from an unclassified state or a lower classified level
to a higher classified level.  The term &igrave;downgrading is
defined as a process whereby an AIS and its immediate physical
environment is adjusted from a higher level of classified information
to a lower level of classified information or is adjusted from
a classified processing period to an unclassified processing period.
<BR>

<P>
When adjusting an AIS from a classified
processing period to an unclassified period, all classified information
in the AIS must be eradicated, i.e., sanitized, and removed according
to the detailed steps contained in the &igrave;Classified Processing
Upgrade/Downgrade Checklist&icirc; for the AIS.  Each AISSC is
responsible for developing the detailed steps for the checklist(s),
which will be included in the addendum for the AIS.  The format
of the checklist(s) shall include the following information:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
 a) Name(s) of the authorized person(s)
accomplishing the checklist steps;
<P>
 b) Date and time when upgrading actions
were started and terminated;
<P>
 c) Date and time when downgrading
actions were started and terminated;
<P>
 d) The initials of the authorized
person indicating that each step was performed or a notation that
the step was not applicable (N/A) for this session;
<P>
 e) An area where comments about the
upgrade or downgrade actions can be recorded.  <BR>
</ul>
The &igrave;Classified Processing
Upgrade/Downgrade Checklist&icirc; must reflect the current classification
status of the AIS at all times.<BR>
<p>
<P>
<B>UPGRADING/PREPROCESSING</B>.
 To adjust the AIS to a higher security level, the following objectives
shall be met:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
 a) All unauthorized personnel shall
be removed from the AIS area or precluded access to the AIS.
 b) The physical integrity of the
area shall be verified and any required modifications and controls
shall be imposed such as installing covers over windows or installing
barriers or signs..<p>
 c) Obtain from approved storage
all classified and &igrave;Protect as Secret&icirc; media and
material needed to perform the upgrade.<p>
 d) Ensure that all previous processing
on the AIS has ceased.  Then, shutdown the system to be upgraded.
<p>
 e) If applicable, inspect AIS
security seals.  Inspection of these seals is required before
classified processing is initiated.  If a seal is broken, classified
processing shall not be initiated until the AISSC has inspected
the H/W for unauthorized tampering.  The discovery of the broken
seal and the required inspection shall be documented on an AIS
Maintenance Report<p>
 f) Physically or logically disconnect
or power off all AIS devices or components not accredited to process
classified data.  (Note: Logical disconnects are not authorized
for AIS accredited at the Top Secret level.)<p>
 g) Clear the volatile memory of
the AIS and all peripheral devices by removing power for 30 seconds.
 (Refer to Section 3.4.1.)<p>
 h) Install required classified
or &icirc;Protect as Secret&icirc; media and material on the AIS,
as appropriate. (e.g., printer ribbons, disks, special printer
paper,. etc.)<p>
 i) Power on and boot the system,
verifying no errors.<p>
 j) Perform clearance of other
unclassified media and nonvolatile devices.  (Refer to Section
3.4.)<p>
 l) If connecting or networking
to another AIS, verify that all AIS with which you will be communicating
have been upgraded to the same classification level, then establish
communication.<p>
 m) Verify that write-protect mechanisms
of mounted unclassified media are engaged and operational by attempting
to write to the media.<p>
 n) Ensure that applicable audit
records are initiated.<BR>
</ul>
<p>
<P>
<B>DOWNGRADING/POSTPROCESSING</B>.
 To adjust the AIS to a lower security level, the following objectives
shall be met:<BR>
<ul>
 a) Ensure that all previous processing
on the AIS has ceased.  If the AIS was connected to another accredited
AIS, coordinate the disconnect or disabling of the communications
link.<p>
 b) Ensure that all classified
or &icirc;Protect as Secret&icirc; material which was created
or utilized during the classified processing session, but which
is not needed for the downgrade process, is removed from the AIS.
 Ensure all material are properly marked, and then either secured
in an approved container or disposed of as classified waste.
<p>
 c) Perform clearance of devices
with non-volatile memory if the device will remain with the AIS
or controlled physical environment.  If the device is to removed
from the AIS or its controlled physical environment, it will require
sanitization.  (Refer to Section 3.4).<p>
 d) Clear all laser printers by
printing five pages of unclassified data.  After review, these
pages may be handled as unclassified.  Also check paper paths
to ensure they are clear.<p>
 e) Perform an orderly system shutdown,
ensuring that all CPUs and associated devices with volatile memory
are sanitized by removal of power for a minimum of thirty (30)
seconds.<p>
 f) Remove and store in an approved
container all classified or &icirc;Protect as Secret&icirc;  media
or material such as printer ribbons, internal wax roll cartridges,
fixed disks, removable disks, and media required for clearing
procedures.<p>
 g) Ensure that all applicable
audit trails have been completed.<p>
</ul>
<P>
<B>3.2 MARKING AND STORAGE OF MATERIAL
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>3.2.1 Classified Printed Output
and Video Displays<BR>
</B>
<P>
All output from an accredited AIS shall,
upon generation, be reviewed to determine its classification level.
 In general, classified AIS printed output shall be considered
working papers.  Therefore, as a minimum, all classified AIS output
shall be dated when created, marked with the highest classification
of any information contained in the material, clearly marked as
a &quot;working paper&quot;, protected, and destroyed when they
have served their purpose.<BR>
<ul>
<P>
 a) Printed Output - It shall be the
responsibility of the user to ensure that all output is marked
with the proper security classification.  Output containing classified
information shall be marked with the security classification on
the &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; of each page, as well
as on the &quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot; cover.  If unclassified
output will be incorporated into or used in conjunction with classified
material, it is necessary to mark the output as &quot;UNCLASSIFIED&quot;.
 If the unclassified output is not to be used in conjunction with
classified material, it need not be marked.  The user shall be
responsible for immediately retrieving the output from the printing
device and for performing a review of the output in order to ensure
that it bears the correct security classification markings.  Until
the review is completed, the material shall be protected as if
it were classified at the highest level authorized to be processed
by the AIS.  AIS approved to process classified data may be used
to produce more than one copy of output.  <BR>

<P>
 b) Video Displays - It shall be the
responsibility of the user to determine the classification of
material appearing on the Video Display Terminal (VDT) and to
ensure that only personnel with a &quot;need-to-know&quot; and
proper clearance shall have visual access to the display.  Any
VDT situated in a close proximity to the exterior glass wall must
be protected from visual compromise from any person outside the
building.  This may be accomplished by closing the blinds or turning
the VDT away from the glass wall.  If a printed copy of the VDT
display is made, it shall be the responsibility of the user to
ensure that the printout is properly marked and safeguarded in
accordance with its classification.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
<B>3.2.2 AIS Storage Devices<BR>
</B>
<P>
Each AIS storage device and/or media
(e.g., magnetic tapes, removable disks, non-removable disks, etc.),
which contains classified data or cannot be write-protected during
classified processing periods, shall be marked with its overall
security classification, a title, appropriate downgrading notation,
creation date, and name and address of the originating facility.
 The title of each storage device shall be descriptive enough
so as to be able to determine the general contents.  For non-removable
disks, the required markings will be affixed to the mechanism
housing.<BR>

<P>
<B>3.2.3 Classified Material Tracking
<BR>
</B>
<P>
The AISSC must coordinate with their
Information Management System (IMS) Custodian for programmatic
requirements relative to &igrave;tracking&icirc; of all classified
material, including AIS media, on each specific program.  Classified
material received from or delivered to external sources must be
processed through the program IMS Control Station and the Classified
Mail Services (CMS).<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>3.2.4 Handling of Unclassified Only
Data<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>3.2.4.1 Input Control<BR>
</B>
<P>
Any unclassified media source (magnetic
tape, disk, floppy) from which any unclassified data is being
input to the AIS shall first be &quot;write-protected&quot;. 
The write-protection mechanism must be verified each session.
 Media with a physical write-protect mechanism may be verified
by observing that the write-protect mechanism is in place or that
it is removed, depending on the type of media.  Software write-protection
must be verified by attempting to write to the media.  If data
can be written to the media, the media must be marked and handled
as classified material and the AISSC and ISSR notified immediately.
<BR>

<P>
<B>3.2.4.2 Output Control<BR>
</B>
<P>
If unclassified information resident
on a classified AIS must be copied or extracted to unclassified
media special precautions must be taken to prevent the inadvertent
copying of unintended classified information onto the unclassified
media.  The area of the output media where classified information
could potentially be written is between the logical and physical
end of file boundaries and is commonly referred to as the &igrave;slack&icirc;
space or area.  It is extremely important that precautions be
taken to prevent any inadvertent copying of classified information
to unclassified media.  For example, for an AIS using Microsoft
Word, ensure that Fast Save is not enabled.  For the more commonly
used systems, the following direction should be followed:<BR>

<P>
Once this review has been accomplished
and no classified information has been found, the media may be
handled as unclassified.  If classified information is found,
the media must be marked and handled as classified material. 
<BR>

<P>
This review must be done each time
information is archived without exception.<BR>
<ul>
<P>
 a) Macintosh and DOS/Windows-based
Microcomputers<BR>
<ul>
<P>
  The following procedure shall be
used for unclassified file copying or extracting unclassified
text.  (Note: this procedure is written for Macintosh systems,
but may also be applied to DOS/Windows systems.  DOS nomenclature
is shown in parenthesis):<BR>

<P>
 1) Ensure that the source file to
be copied or the information to be extracted is visually free
of classified information;<BR>

<P>
 2)  Create a new folder (subdirectory)
on the source media and then copy the source file or any extracts
into a newly created folder (subdirectory).  If you are extracting
data you must cut and paste this data to a new file located in
the new folder (subdirectory).<BR>

<P>
 3)  Note and record size of the file(s)
in the new folder (subdirectory).  For Macintosh systems-under
the &igrave;View&icirc; pull down menu, select the &igrave;by
name&icirc; option and note and record the number of bytes shown.
<BR>

<P>
 4)  Empty the trash. (N/A for DOS/Windows
systems)<BR>

<P>
 5)  Accomplish a &igrave;Shut Down&icirc;
(exit Windows) and &igrave;Power Off&icirc; to clear the memory
and reboot.  Ensure that no classified files are opened at this
time.  (For DOS/Windows systems, ensure that the autoexec.bat
file does not automatically open any classified files.)<BR>

<P>
 6)  Ensure that the target unclassified
disk is freshly initialized prior to copying a file or extracting
unclassified portions from a classified file.<BR>

<P>
 7)  Insert the unclassified target
disk and copy the folder (file in subdirectory) containing the
unclassified file from the source media.<BR>

<P>
 8)  Eject the unclassified target
disk; write protect it; and then re-insert into drive.<BR>

<P>
 9)  Compare the byte count of the
source file with the byte count of the target file.<BR>

<P>
 10)  If the byte count differs, notify
the AISSC immediately and protect the disk as classified.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
 b) VAX/VMS<BR>
<ul>
<P>
  The VMS operating system (version
4.3 and newer) prevents the disk area beyond the file&iacute;s
&igrave;&lt;EOF&gt;&igrave; marker from having any meaningful
data on that area by implementing a protection scheme called &quot;high-water
marking,&icirc; which is (by default) enabled when a volume is
mounted.  AISSCs are reminded that this default must not be overridden
or by-passed by system administrators when mounting classified
disk volumes.  The copying of unclassified files from a classified
media to an unclassified media, does not require special handling
other than ensuring that the file contents are, in fact, unclassified,
and that only the intended file(s) were copied.<BR>

  The copying of unclassified files
from a classified media to an unclassified media, does not require
special handling other than ensuring that the file contents are,
in fact, unclassified, and that only the intended file(s) were
copied.<BR>

<P>
  The UNIX file compare commands (<I>diff</I>
and <I>cmp</I>) may be used to verify files (such as large text,
binary, and executables) for which visual verification is not
practical.  The command <I>diff</I> should be used to verify text
files and the command <I>cmp</I> should be used to verify non-text
(binary) files.  The following procedure shall be followed.  (This
procedure has previously been approved by DIS.)<BR>

<P>
 1) Determine that the files to be
moved are unclassified.
<P>
 2) Place an unclassified, newly formatted,
write enabled media into the classified output device.
<P>
 3) Write the unclassified files to
the media.
<P>
 4) Write protect the media.
<P>
 5) Read all files off the media into
a temporary directory.
<P>
 6) Using <I>diff </I>(for text) or
<I>cmp</I> (for binary) compare the files read from the media
to the original files.  (Refer to UNIX User&iacute;s reference
document for correct syntax.)
<P>
 7) If there are any differences, protect
the media as Secret and contact security and the system administrator
to report this problem.
<P>
 8) If the files compare as identical
then the media may be used on an unclassified system.<BR>

<P>
<B>3.3 SECURITY REPORTS<BR>
</B>
<P>
All security incidents shall be investigated
to determine their cause, and where possible, the corrective action
to be taken.  All<B> </B>incidents caused by a failure in the
system's standard hardware or software shall be reported to the
AISSC.  All incidents shall be fully documented so that areas
requiring special corrective action can be identified.  If it
is determined that a compromise of classified information may
have occurred, the AISSC and ISSR shall be immediately notified
and a formal investigation shall be conducted.  Individual investigation
reports shall be maintained for three (3) years.<BR>

<P>
<B>3.4 CLEARANCE, SANITIZATION, DECLASSIFICATION,
DESTRUCTION<BR>
</B>
<P>
CLEARANCE.  Clearing an AIS/component
is the removal of classified information in such a way that there
is assurance, proportional to the sensitivity of the data, that
the data may not be reconstructed using normal system capabilities,
i.e., through the keyboard.  In addition to clearing all AIS equipment
and nonremovable media during upgrade and downgrade of an AIS,
individual components shall be cleared whenever there is a need
for an unauthorized person to have access to that component. 
The cleared equipment/media must remain within the approved AIS
physical safeguards and retain all classification markings.  Clearance
actions include visual inspection, removal of classified material
and removal of classified data from memory, devices, and other
components with data retentive capabilities.  Clearance actions
for memory/media will be in accordance with the following paragraphs
and the Clearance &amp; Sanitization Matrix (Table 3.1).  Specific
procedures for clearing devices containing non-volatile memory
and media not reflected below shall be included in the addendum
for the specific AIS <BR>

<P>
SANITIZATION.  Sanitizing AIS memory/media
is accomplished so that the device/media may be released from
classified physical safeguards.  Media and non-volatile memory
components used for processing at the Top Secret level may not
be sanitized by overwrite, but must be destroyed.  Sanitization
is authorized for Secret and/or Confidential devices and shall
be performed whenever an approved AIS component or classified
media is being removed from its approved physical safeguards.
 Sanitization procedures include all actions performed for clearance
and may additionally include more stringent procedures for overwrite
or degaussing of AIS media/memory.  Sanitization procedures for
rigid media must include methods for determining bad blocks. 
All bad blocks must be overwritten, or verified that they have
never contained any classified information.  All sanitization
procedures must be in accordance with the following sections or
with Table 3.1, Clearance and Sanitization Matrix.  Sanitization
procedures shall validated prior to submission for accreditation
by the CSA.  All media being sanitized will be verified at random
locations.  Where sanitization of memory or disk media cannot
be accomplished by authorized S/W overwrite, the memory and disk
media may be sanitized by <B>YOUR COMPANY</B> Security using an
approved magnetic degausser or physically destroyed.  <BR>

<P>
DECLASSIFICATION.  Declassification
relates to the administrative tasks to be taken prior to the release
of a device which has been sanitized.  Declassification actions
include removal of all classified labels and/or markings, and
authorization for release by the IMS Control Station and the ISSR
or designee.<BR>

<P>
DESTRUCTION.  When no approved method
for media sanitization is available, media will be physically
destroyed.  The acceptable methods for media destruction are burning,
melting, mutilation and chemical decomposition.  All physical
destruction shall be accomplished by the Government Security Department.
<BR>

<P>
Procedures for clearing and sanitization
of memory and storage media  are shown in Table 3.1.<BR>

<P>
<B>3.4.1 Flexible Magnetic Media<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>3.4.1.1 Tape<BR>
</B>
<P>
When all classified information has
been sanitized from the magnetic tape through the use of <B>YOUR
COMPANY</B> Security approved degaussing equipment, the tape may
be handled on an unclassified basis, provided further that:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
 a) All<B> </B>markings identifying
previous source, subject matter, use or classification of the
information previously recorded thereon are removed.<BR>

<P>
 b) Operation of the degaussing equipment
is in strict compliance with the manufacturer's instructions.
<BR>

<P>
 c) The required destruction records
and certificates for accountable classified information are executed
and maintained at the appropriate IMS Control Station.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
<B>3.4.1.2 Bernoulli or Floppy Disks
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Bernoulli and floppy disks may be cleared
through the use of <B>YOUR COMPANY</B> Security approved degaussing
equipment.  However, this type media may be sanitized only by
physical destruction.<BR>

<P>
<B>3.4.2 Rigid Magnetic Disk<BR>
</B>
<P>
Classified rigid magnetic disk storage
devices shall be overwritten a minimum of three times-once with
a character (i.e., the binary high value-all &quot;ones&quot;),
its complement ( i.e., the binary low value-all &quot;zeros&quot;)
and then with a random character (i.e., a single numeric or alphabetic
pattern.)  Where possible, verification of the overwrite must
be accomplished to ensure that the storage device has been sanitized.
 Unclassified data used in the final overwrite shall he left on
the device.  In the absence of the ability to perform this overwrite,
the disk must be taken to security for physical destruction. 
The following paragraphs contain detailed sanitization instructions
for <B>YOUR COMPANY</B> commonly used systems.  Additional instructions
for more specialized systems may be contained in the addendum
for a specific AIS.<BR>

<P>

according to the user&iacute;s manual for sanitization. <BR>

<P>
As an alternative, a device developed
by R-Squared, the STM-100 is used.  The STM-100 is a low-level
formatting and purging device that writes the values 00000000,
11111111, 00000000 and a random character over the entire magnetic
disk platter. <BR>

<P>
<B>Auspex Net Server:<BR>
</B>
<P>
Sanitize the disk drive(s) using either
the PURGE option of Sun's Format command or an R-Squared developed

 <BR>

<P>
To sanitize the Photo Receptor belt
fifteen (15) pages containing the word &quot;SANITIZED&quot; must
be printed and the sheets reviewed to verify that they do not
contain any classified information.  The paper paths should be
examined to verify that no previously printed pages of potentiality
classified information is left inside the printer.  The 512 Kbyte
of volatile RAM is cleared (sanitized) by powering off the printer.
 Power should remain off for at least fifteen (15) seconds.  Any
Floppy diskettes used to boot or configure the printer should
be removed, properly marked, and secured in an approved container.
 There is no approved procedure to declassify the printers internal

<P>
 c) Authorized User Listings--See following
Note.<BR>

<P>
 <I>NOTE: For those AIS that have an automated
accounting utility, this utility must be turned on.  The accounting
feature must reflect the identity of the user, i.e. through an
account number, and the time and date the user logged on and off
the AIS.  For those AIS that do not have an automated accounting
utility, there shall be a mechanism in place to determine the
authorized users for that AIS.  For Dedicated Mode AIS within
a &igrave;Closed Area,&icirc; the area&iacute;s Access List is
sufficient.  For AIS not located in a &igrave;Closed Area,&icirc;
a list of authorized users posted in the immediate area or maintained

<center><h3>A ELETRONORTE E O MEIO AMBIENTE NA AMAZNIA</h3>
</center>

<dd>A Amaznia notabiliza-se pela magnitude de seus recursos florestais e pela riqueza de sua biodiversidade, cuja preservao deve ser um dos imperativos de um modelo de desenvolvimento sustentvel para a regio. Por outro lado, no se pode ignorar, tambm, a importncia do aproveitamento de seu imenso potencial hidreltrico no equacionamento das futuras demandas de energia eltrica em toda a matriz energtica nacional. O privilgio de se dispor dessa importante fonte no pode ser desprezado, devendo, ao contrrio ser revertido em benefcios  sociedade nacional e, sobretudo, regional.
<dd>Ciente dessa indissociabilidade dos sistemas eltricos e do meio ambiente na Amaznia, a Eletronorte tem se empenhado na busca do adequado equilbrio entre a maximizao dos benefcios energticos de seus empreendimentos e a minimizao dos seus impactos.
<dd>Estas preocupaes tm estado presentes desde as primeiras aes da Empresa na regio e, desde ento, os esforos para suplantar as dificuldades encontradas, frente ao seu pioneirismo, resultaram num processo contnuo de significativo acmulo de experincia no trato das questes ambientais.
<dd>Diretriz bsica de todos os estudos e aes implementados, o intenso intercmbio com as diversas instituies de pesquisas e aes ambientais (IBAMA, INPA, IMTM, MPEG, etc.), atravs de convnios, representou parceria importante para a conduo dos trabalhos e para o avano do conhecimento sobre os ecossistemas da Amaznia.
<dd>Os Centros de Proteo Ambiental - CPA's, implantados pela Eletronorte nas Hidreltricas Tucuru (PA), Balbina (AM) e Samuel (RO), constituem hoje ncleos promissores para a pesquisa  regional, diponibilizando uma ampla infra-estrutura de laboratrios, equipamentos e apoio logstico para o estabelecimento de novos convnios com Universidades e instituies de pesquisa.<p>

Com uma rea de 3,5 milhes de km, a Amaznia brasileira requer sistemas eficientes de coleta de informaes
para a gesto racional dos seus recursos florestais. O presente trabalho prope o desenvolvimento de um mtodo
de quantificao de fitomassa area de floresta tropical, a partir de dados espectrais obtidos de imagens
TM LANDSAT 5 e HRV SPOT 1, em rea a ser inundada por hidreltrica. Para isso, determinou-se a correlao entre
as variveis de fitomassa area, dendromtricas, espectrais e  de cota, em quatro parcelas consideradas:
Floresta Densa de Terra Firme - Relevo Ondulado (parcelas 1 e 4), Floresta Densa de Terra Firme - Relevo Plano
(parcela 2) e Floresta de Baixio (parcela 3). As parcelas foram divididas em trs estratos: superior, intermedirio
e inferior. Ao contrrio dos demais estratos, as variveis espectrais, combinadas com as variveis de fitomassa,
no permitiram a quantificao da fitomassa area do estrato superior da floresta. Com o uso de Anlise de Regresso
identificaram-se as equaes de quantificao de fitomassa. O mtodo proposto apresentou-se vivel e com resultados
significativos seja com a utilizao de imagens TM-LANDSAT ou HRV-SPOT, seja imagens ndice ou imagens frao.
Dentre doze modelos testados, optou-se pela utilizao do modelo de ajuste linear, que demonstrou significncia entre
as variveis de fitomassa dos estratos intermedirio e inferior e as variveis espectrais e de cota.  recomendvel a
realizao de estudo de modelagem, com vistas  definio de modelos mais eficientes para quantificao de fitomassa nos trs estratos.<br><br>

<DD>A Centrais Eltricas do Norte do Brasil S.A. - ELETRONORTE, concessionria de servios pblicos de energia eltrica, empresa do Sistema Eletrobrs, foi criada em 1973, tendo hoje como rea de atuao os Estados do Par, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Rondnia, Roraima, Acre, Amap, Tocantins e Maranho, abrangendo uma extenso que representa 58% do territrio nacional.<BR>
<DD>Nessa regio, que coincide com a Amaznia Legal, a Eletronorte tem sido responsvel pelos estudos de inventrios das suas imensas bacias hidrogrficas, pela viabilidade tcnica, econmica e ambiental dos aproveitamentos hidreltricos e pelo projeto, construo e operao de usinas hidreltricas e termeltricas e seus respectivos sistemas de transmisso, alm dos servios de distribuio de energia eltrica em Manaus e Boa Vista.<BR>
<DD>Cumprir essa misso significou vencer um enorme desafio, perante o desconhecimento da regio e a precariedade de sua infra-estrutura bsica  poca dos primeiros trabalhos da Empresa.<BR>
<DD>Na concretizao desses esforos a Eletronorte promoveu investimentos da ordem de R$ 13,7 bilhes na regio, ampliando sua capacidade de gerao de 60 MW para 5.433 MW em seus 22 anos,  enfrentando ainda a complexidade dos ecossistemas da Amaznia, perante o imperativo de se buscar a conciliao entre os interesses energticos e os aspectos scio-ambientais, que demandaram intensos esforos, estudos e pesquisas.<BR>
<DD>Durante os ltimos 23 anos, a Eletronorte tem se apoiado na criatividade de solues e inovaes tecnolgicas para possilibilitar a explorao energtica adequada da regio Norte e o suprimento de seu mercado.<BR>
<DD>Todos estes esforos consolidam hoje um conhecimento e experincia, fundamentais  implantao de novos projetos na Amaznia, garantindo uma insero muito mais adequada dos futuros empreendimentos.<P>

<center><h3>A EXPANSO DOS SISTEMAS ELTRICOS NA AMAZNIA</h3>
</center>

<dd>A garantia do atendimento s necessidades futuras de energia eltrica na Amaznia, alavanca fundamental de todo seu processo de desenvolvimento,  essencial para se minimizarem as desigualdades regionais.
<dd>Assim, a expanso dos sistemas eltricos na regio, atravs de fontes convencionais e alternativas,  uma necessidade indiscutvel que, perante as modernas regras da economia e o atual quadro poltico institucional, requer esforos na efetivao de parcerias entre os governos estaduais, municipais, federal e com a iniciativa privada, alm de aes objetivando revises tarifrias que possam promover maior realidade em relao aos custos dos servios.
<dd>Alteraes recentes na legislao pertinente ao Setor Eltrico vm definindo condies para essa participao da iniciativa privada, atravs de consrcios de auto-produtores, produtores independentes e outras modalidades ainda no delimitadas, todas elas favorecidas pela criao do Sistema Nacional de Transmisso de Energia Eltrica - SINTREL, democratizando o acesso s malhas de transmisso do Pas e regulamentando negociaes para gerao em um determinado ponto dessa malha e recepo em outro qualquer, mesmo nos sistemas isolados da Amaznia.
<dd>A competitividade de mercado, que hoje se impe como regra na economia brasileira, s poder ser implantada, em condies justas, se as especificidades e carncias regionais forem adequadamente equilibradas, tarefa que impe um verdadeiro esprito de solidariedade na conjugao de esforos de todas as instncias de governo, do Setor Eltrico e da iniciativa privada.<p>

<center>A facilidade de agregao de imagens a qualquer  consulta  uma das caractersticas do Sistema.

<img src="siga5.gif"></center><br><br>

<dd>Uma ferramenta importante que o sistema possui  a elaborao de matrizes do  dados armazenados no sistema. O usurio pode  alinhar na matriz os mesmos dados de empreendimentos diferentes.

<dd>Assim, o SIGA permite a sistematizao do mais amplo espectro de informaes.  um sistema completamente aberto, onde cabe ao usurio definir os temas, os dados, enfim todo o banco de dados do sistema. Toda a sua estrutura de dados  estabelecida por tabelas que so montadas pelo usurio. O sistema tambm  capaz de absorver a incluso de novas informaes, a qualquer tempo, sem implicar em alterao ou elaborao de programas e da estrutura dos arquivos.<p>

<dd>O Sistema est configurado em dois mdulos funcionais, separados em funo da comodidade de sua instalao e operao: Mdulo de Consulta e de Atualizao.<p>

<dd>Para desenvolvimento do SIGA foi utilizado o software Visual Basic Professional, verso 3.0, que permitiu uma interface grfica bastante amigvel (padro Windows). O gerenciador do banco de dados  o ACCESS 2.0. A configurao mnima necessria para instalao do sistema  um microcomputador 386 com memria RAM de 8 Mb e disco rgido de 100 Mb.<p>

<h3>Pioneirismo em Eficincia Energtica</h3></center>

<dd>Importante patrimnio histrico e cultural do Brasil e smbolo inconfundvel  da cidade de
Manaus, o Teatro Amazonas  torna-se tambm, a partir de agora, a primeira casa de espetculos
do pas a implementar um projeto de eficientizao energtica. Com o apoio da Eletronorte e do
Procel/Eletrobrs (Programa Nacional de Combate ao desperdcio de Energia Eltrica) e Philips do
Brasil, o Teatro teve seu sistema de iluminao inteiramente remodelado, recebendo dispositivos de
ltima gerao que iro proporcionar uma economia de 36% no seu consumo de energia eltrica.<p>

<b>Tecnologia rima com arte</b><br>

<dd>O Projeto envolveu a substituio de todas as lmpadas incandescentes do Teatro por lmpadas
fluorescentes compactas e a instalao de um banco de capacitores, equipamento que permite melhor
aproveitamento da energia fornecida atravs da correo do fator de potncia.<p>

<dd>As lmpadas fluorescentes compactas, tambm chamadas de lmpadas eletrnicas, foram doadas pela
Philips do Brasil. Equipadas com um reator eletrnico miniaturizado, embutido na base, elas consomem
at 80% menos energia do que lmpadas incandescentes de igual potncia e duram dez vezes mais.
O projeto concebido para o Teatro Amazonas aumentou o fluxo luminoso do sistema e reduziu a carga trmica
para o sistema de ar condicionado, melhorando ainda mais o desempenho energtico.<p>

<dd>As medidas adotadas tornaro possvel a renegociao do contrato de demanda do Teatro Amazonas com a
Eletronorte, consubstanciando a economia obtida numa reduo efetiva dos gastos com energia eltrica.
Elas contribuem, tambm, para o aumento da confiabilidade do sistema eltrico do Teatro, uma vez que retiram
cargas do sistema no horrio de maior consumo, nos dias de espetculo.<p>

<b>A economia em nmeros</b><br>

<dd>A partir da implementao do projeto, o Teatro Amazonas passa a economizar R$ 55 mil/ano com energia eltrica.
Levando em conta que as medidas de eficientizao custaram R$ 44 mil, o retorno do investimento se dar em menos de um ano. Veja os nmeros do projeto:<p>

<center><h3> 7. FUTURE GENERATION AND TRANSMISSION ADDITIONS</h3></center>

<dd>The Brazilian electric sector is undergoing a restructuration. According with the new legal
framework a bidding for the concession  of all prospective (not the comitted)  generation and
transmission projects must be carried out by the Government. Then the listed prospective projects
dont represent  guaranteed concessions. The Tucurui power plant expansion is an exception to this
rule as it already is an ELETRONORTE concession.<p>

<dd>Most projects following listed (7.1 and 7.2) dont have a defined finance source yet. The
committed aditions have been carried on so far with self financing <b>( ELETRONORTE and ELETROBRAS ).</b><p>
The finance sources for the existent ELETRONORTE facilities and some ongoing projects are:<p>

<dd><b><font color="blue"> The Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES)<br>
<dd> The National Development Fund (FND)<br>
<dd> The Interamerican Development Bank (BID)<br>
<dd> ELETROBRAS - Holding Electric Company<br>
<dd> The French Government<br>
<dd> Stwart Stenvenson - Equipment Manufacturer<br>
<dd> OECF (Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund - Japan)</b></font><p>

<dd>In the other hand the feasibility of some other ongoing and future projects have been
achieved with the partnership of local utilities and private companies as well. For instance the
companies below were partners in some important projects:<p>

<dd><b><font color="blue"> ALCOA - Metalurgical Industry<br>
<dd> ALUNORTE - Metalurgical Industry<br>
<dd> Para Pigmentos - Pigment Industry</b></font><p>

<b><img src="/bola.gif"> 7.1 Generation Additions</b><br>
<dd>Recent studies pointed out the Natural Gas as the most convenient fuel source for
the thermal units both technically and economically  to substitute the diesel consumption due to the
large gas reserves available in the Amazonas State. Therefore it is expected that the diesel thermal
units listed below  have their fuel changed to natural gas in the near future.<p>

<dd>Brazilian Amazon occupies an area of about 5 million km2 and  has deserved the worlds attention, in the last decades, not only because the peculiarities of its soil and vegetation, but also due to the environmental implications related  to the utilization of its extensive natural resources.<br>
<dd>Researches and studies have been carried out by national and international organizations, all pointing out that the Brazilian Amazonic region cannot remain as a permanent  natural reserve, keeping the local population apart from the national development. The rational exploitation of its immense resources should be focused on the sustainable growth of the region and  integration of the local society to the rest of the country, through a modernization process that improves its living conditions and social well-being.<br>
<dd><font color="red"> ELETRONORTE </font>  is a subsidiary of Centrais Eltricas Brasileiras S.A.<font color="blue"> ELETROBRS, </font> the holding company of the Brazilian Electrical Sector, and is responsible for the generation, transmission and distribution of electrical energy in all northern Brazil.<br>
<dd>Having been founded 23 years ago,<font color="red"> ELETRONORTE </font> has a valuable know-how about the Amazonic Region, remarkably on the exploitation of its hydroelectric potential, taking into consideration all social, economic and environmental aspects involved, with special attention to the indigenous culture and habitat preservation.<BR> 
<dd>During this period the company has invested US$ 14 billion, augmenting its installed generation capacity from 40 to 5433 MW, with four  hydroelectric power plants summing 4660 MW and twelve thermoelectric units adding up to 773 MW. Moreover<font color="red">  ELETRONORTE </font> has constructed 6120 km of transmission lines, of which 2706 km correspond to  500 kV lines, and 43 substations with a transformation capacity of 15119 MVA. The company has also built  4085 km of high and low voltage distribution networks.<br>
<dd>Inserted in the<font color="green">  Federal Government </font> privatization policy<font color="red"> ELETRONORTE</font> has offered excellent opportunities to private partners in its new generation, transmission and distribution projects.<br>
<dd>In addition to the greatest already inventored hydroelectric potencial in the world, the natural gas reserves located in the Solimes river basin has opened other good investment perspectives, through the installation of gas driven thermal units in the capitals and interior cities of  northern<font color="blue"> Brazil.</font> These gas reserves, estimated to have 58 billion cubic meters, at very competitive prices, are exploited by the State owned company <font color="GREEN"> PETROBRS.</FONT><br><br>

<dd>The Amazon forest has been the subject of much debate due to the extent of human intervention occurring there.
The Brazilian Amazon, with 3.5 million km, requires efficient systems of data collection for rational management
of its forest resources. The present dissertation develops a quantitative method for determining the biomass of
tropical forest using satellite imagery from TM-LANDSAT 5 and HRV-SPOT in an area to be inundated for hydroelectricity.
The study determined the correlation of biomass above-ground and tree measurements with spectral response and elevation
in four samples: Dense Forest on Dry Land - Undulated Relief (samples 1 and 4), Dense Forest on Dry Land - Flat Relief 
(sample 2), and Floodplain Forest (sample 3). The forest samples were divided into three vertical levels for analysis.
In comparison with the other forest levels, the spectral variables combined with the biomass variables did not permit
the quantification of the biomass in the highest level of the forest. Regression analysis identified the equations for
quantifying biomass. The proposed method is practical and gave significant results using either image index or image
fraction for both TM-LANDSAT or HRV-SPOT data. Of the twelve models tested, a linear model was which gave a significant
relationship for the biomass in the intermediate and low levels with spectral and elevation variables.
It is recommended that future studies determine the most efficient model to quantify the biomass in the three levels of the forest.<br>

<b><img src="bola.gif"> Abstract</b> - This paper aims to evaluate the association among phytomass, spectral, dendrometric and altimetric parameters. Data were obtained in a sample of the Amazon Forest,
at the river Trombetas, State of Par, Brazil. The Multivariate Analysis in Principal Components and the Graphic Analysis were used as the basic methodology. The results showed a significant
relation between spectral and phytomass variables. Therefore, it is possible to quantify tropical forest phytomass in function of spectral variables.<br><br>

<b><img src="bola.gif"> Keywords</b> - Phytomass; vegetation index; multivariate analysis; Amazon forest.<br><br>

	Students comprise approximately one-quarter of <A HREF="/TMSHome.html">The Minerals, Metals &amp; Society's</A> (TMS's) approximately 13,000 individual membership, and they are encouraged to take an active role in society activities. To facilitate this interaction, TMS has <A HREF="Chapters/ChapterList.html">student chapters</A> throughout the world, guided by advisors who work closely with <A HREF="/TMSHome.html">TMS</A> and the Student Affairs Committee to integrate the activities of the chapter. Students have access to a variety scholarships through <A HREF="/TMSHome.html">TMS</A> and can compete in a number of <A HREF="Awards.html">society-sponsored contests</A>. Students also qualify for drastic discounts on registration fees at <A HREF="/Meetings/Meetings.html">TMS meetings</A> and on <A HREF="/pubs/Publications.html">TMS publications</A>. Many
special activities for students are held at major meetings of the society (i.e., <A HREF="/Meetings/TMS-Fall-Meetings.html">Materials Week</A> and the <A HREF="/Meetings/TMS-Annual-Meetings.html">TMS Annual Meeting</A>). To maximize the opportunities available to students, <A HREF="/TMSHome.html">TMS</A> cosponsors many of its student activities with <A HREF="http://www.asm-intl.org">ASM International</A> and the Metallurgical Society of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy &amp; Petroleum Engineers.<p>

	Keeping young professionals within the society after graduation is also a key concern of <A HREF="/TMSHome.html">TMS</A>. Upon graduation, students
can apply for automatic junior member status, which enables them to make the
transition to full membership in the society gradually and affordably. The
first year of registration as an automatic junior member is complimentary; a
reduced dues fee is charged the second and third years. To address the needs of
this particular group within the society, <A HREF="/TMSHome.html">TMS</A> has formed the <A HREF="/YoungLeaders/YoungLeaders.html">Young Leaders
Committee</A>. The committee is open to <A HREF="/TMSHome.html">TMS</A> members under the age of 35 and promotes the influx of young professionals into all aspects of the society, from technical committees to the Board of Directors.<p>

<H2><A NAME="Requirements">Requirements for a TMS Student Chapter<BR>
(Outside of North America)</A></H2>
The Student Chapter is required only to do the following:
<UL>
<LI>Elect a faculty advisor who is a member of TMS.
<LI>Submit an annual report to TMS Headquarters each year, no later than June 30, with the following information: Names of student officers, faculty advisor, and financial statement. An Annual Report Summary Form follows.
</UL>

These are the only requirements TMS makes of a student chapter. However, there are several things that conscientious student officers should do. The first thing is to establish contact with the TMS Student Affairs Coordinator early in the school year, who will be pleased to offer any advice or answer any questions about procedures or any other problems.<P>
Secondly, make sure that the student members of the chapter understand fully the difference between belonging to the local chapter and the national TMS. The benefits of TMS should be carefully outlined. Student officers should examine their chapter, their school, and their particular situation in general to determine worthy projects for the chapter during the school year. These projects could be a cooperative career guidance effort with any <A HREF="http://www.idis.com/aime">AIME</A> section to show high school students the challenge of a career in the minerals industries; constructing a display to illustrate these challenges; organizing extensive field trips; massive chapter participation in the international TMS Student Paper Contest; or any of a number of projects. Essentially, the chapter should involve itself in a worthwhile project to attain some goal.<P>

<H2><A NAME="HowTo">How to Form an International TMS Student Chapter</A></H2>
Take the following steps in the order indicated:
<OL>
<LI>An active TMS student chapter must consist of ten TMS student members. A new student chapter must have the written approval of the university or college at which it is located. The list of ten student members and the written approval from the University should be sent to the TMS Student Affairs Coordinator.
<LI>The group should secure a faculty advisor, who must be a TMS member and send his/her written acceptance to the TMS Student Affairs Coordinator.
<LI>A set of <A HREF="Bylaws.html">bylaws</A> should be drawn up and submitted to the TMS Student Affairs Coordinator. 
<LI>The group should elect officers, each of whom must be a student member of TMS, and send their names to the TMS Student Affairs Coordinator.
<LI>The elected officers and faculty advisor will acquire the appropriate signatures to the TMS Student Chapter Charter Petition.
<LI>The TMS Student Affairs Coordinator will present the aforementioned documents to the TMS Student Affairs Committee, which will vote on affiliation of the student group with TMS. The results of this vote will be forwarded to the TMS Board of Directors, who will decide on whether a TMS charter should be granted.
<LI>A $100 check for start-up monies will be presented from TMS to the newly-established student chapter soon after charter approval.
</OL>

<H2><A NAME="What">What is the Role of the Student Member in TMS?</H2>

Today's metallurgist and materials science engineers must successfully employ their talents within an intensely competitive international marketplace which places a premium on utility, performance, versatility and cost effectiveness. Where a few metals once dominated, an ever-widening spectrum of materials proliferates - materials which are carefully designed from the combined perspectives of applications, structures, properties and processing.<P>

Further, the once unparalleled technological pre-eminence of the United States is eroding in favor of a number of countries that are determinate in their pursuit of high-tech materials opportunities. Faced with these diverse technological and economic challenges, today's metallurgical engineering and materials science and engineering students must temper their formal engineering skills with personal initiative, leadership and, most of all, imagination.<P>

Long ago recognizing the value of integrating engineering students into the membership of a professional organization, TMS currently provides the metallurgical and materials science student with significant opportunities to accelerate his or her professional development by interacting with respected members of industry, academia and government; exploring avenues of publication; and attending local and national meetings which attract engineering experts from throughout the world.<P>

The primary goal of TMS is to serve professionals in the fields of minerals, metallurgical and materials engineering. Emphasis is placed upon "serve" and "professionals." A hallmark of a professional organization is that its members band together to serve the profession, not only for the common good of the profession, but also to benefit individuals of the organization and to promote the contributions of the profession to society as a whole. Among all professional organizations, one commonalty exists above all others: actively participating individuals derive benefits in proportion to their level of involvement.<P>

The above having been said, it is therefore proper for today's professionals, engineers and scientists, to promote TMS to tomorrow's professionals, those students preparing for careers in the minerals, metallurgical and materials engineering fields. No student should blindly accept this promotion without asking "What's in it for me?" The answer to that question is always varied. Each individual student, as well as each individual professional member, derives a different set of benefits from membership. Value of benefits to individuals cannot be judged upon the dollar cost of the annual dues. Important value comes from associations among the members of the organization, the free exchange of new ideas, new technologies, novel solutions to everyday industrial problems, unique approaches to research, etc. The list goes on ad infinitum.<P>

TMS and its members have a selfish motive in recruiting student members. We are proud of our profession in terms of what it has meant to us as individuals and its contributions to society as a whole. We want to make certain that its worthwhile endeavors continue; therefore, we promote TMS membership to today's students -- tomorrow's professionals. We ask that you consider the benefits of TMS student membership, and with equal emphasis we ask that you consider what value you can add to your chosen profession by active participation in TMS.<P>

<H2><A NAME="Joint">Joint TMS/ASM Student Membership (North American Students)</A></H2>

North American students will find that Joint TMS/ASM student membership offers strong advantages. Dues for joint membership are only <B>$19.50 per year</B>, and the student receives the benefit of belonging to both organizations. Joint student members are billed annually on an anniversary cycle for their $19.50 dues, and a rebate of $1.00 per student is sent annually by ASM directly to the student chapter.<P>

Under the Joint Membership provisions, the joint student member is eligible for the publications included with individual membership in both societies. These include JOM (TMS) and Advanced Materials and Processes (ASM). In addition, joint student members may purchase the TMS/ASM Metallurgical Transactions at a special student rate.<P>

In May or December of their graduation year, joint student members should upgrade their membership to Automatic Junior Membership in TMS. Once the joint student member graduates, he/she must join TMS and ASM as an individual member of each society. Dues during the first year as a TMS Automatic Junior Member will be complimentary, and will only be $19.50 for the second and third years.<P>

Also, the Automatic Junior Member receives <B>free of charge</B> their choice of a book from the <A HREF="SeeleyMudd.html">Seeley W. Mudd Fund Free Book List</A>, which contains books from all four <A HREF="http://www.idis.com/aime">AIME</A> Member Societies.<P>

<H2><A NAME="International">International Student Members (Outside North America)</A></H2>

Students living outside North America who wish to join TMS should obtain a membership application from a faculty advisor, student chapter officer or TMS Headquarters. The application must be completed and sent with membership dues in the amount of $15.00 to TMS Headquarters.<P>

Once a student has joined TMS, it is not necessary to file a new membership application each year. One maintains membership by paying annual dues as billed. The TMS dues year runs from December 1 to November 30. A student in good standing, at any degree-granting school approved by the TMS Board of Directors, who has been nominated by an instructor (preferably a Society member), may affiliate with TMS as a Student Member.<P>

<TR><TH><FONT COLOR="#8E2323 SIZE="4">About the Seeley W. Mudd Memorial Fund</FONT>
<TR><TD><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#8E2323">Colonel Seeley W. Mudd won lasting recognition in the mining profession for the vast mineral riches he discovered and developed for the benefit of mankind. To this day, he is still widely known for his indispensable contributions to the growth of such famous mining enterprises as the Ray Consolidated Copper Co., Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., and Cyprus Mining Corp. Yet when he died on May 24, 1926, his friends and colleagues reserved their highest tribute for the unstinting help he had given to young members of their profession. Daniel C. Jackling said, "I know of no other of his profession who did more in the way of encouragement or precept to make beginners in the practical pursuit of
that profession worthy of it."<P>

In administering the fund in memory of Colonel Mudd, <A HREF="http://www.idis.com/aime">AIME</A> has sought to perpetuate his lifelong interest in newcomers to the mining fraternity by using the Fund to produce publications for young engineers and to present each new Junior Member or equivalent with a book of his choice. Colonel Mudd was a devoted member of <A HREF="http://www.idis.com/aime">AIME</A> for 43 years and served as its Vice President and Director.<P>

The Seeley W. Mudd Memorial Fund was entrusted to <A HREF="http://www.idis.com/aime">AIME</A> on September 9, 1929, by Colonel Mudd's widow, Delta M. Mudd, and his two sons, Harvey S. and Seeley G. Mudd.</FONT><P>

<P>THE DARPA PROGRAM IN ADVANCED THIN FILM COATING TECHNOLOGY:</B> <I>Lawrence H. Dubois</I>, Thomas J. Moran, Defense Sciences Office, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Arlington, VA
<P>
Corrosion and wear of mechanical and structural components and systems cost U.S. Industry and the military millions of dollars every year and leads to excess waste, decreased product reliability, and poor worker safety. Unfortunately, the surface preparation, application and use of most coatings to protect to protect these components leads to the generation of significant quantities of hazardous wastes which are subsequently released to the air, water and land. Through the development of new, more advanced corrosion and wear resistant coating systems and/or surface preparation techniques, the DoD and its suppliers can not only minimize the environmental impact of these materials, but improve performance and decrease costs. The DARPA program in advanced thin film coatings is developing innovative technologies to eliminate volatile organic compounds, heavy metals and other hazardous waste materials in the manufacture, application and maintenance of high performance wear, fatigue and corrosion resistant coatings of utility to the DoD.

<P>ADVANCES IN SURFACE TECHNOLOGY IN RUSSIA:</B> <I>Anthony J. Perry</I>, ISM Technologies, San Diego, CA; Jesse N. Matossian, Hughes Research Labs, Malibu, CA; Michael O. Thompson, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY
<P>
<P>Since the removal of the Berlin Wall and the changes in the relationships between the former Soviet Union with the rest of the world, a great deal of information has become available on their technology. Developments in some areas appear to have outpaced those in the West, specifically in the application of ion beams to surface modification. The present authors have had the opportunity to attend workshops in Russia and to visit laboratories. In the present work, a report is given on some of the technologies reviewed there and which are now becoming available to the West. These include novel designs in the fields of cathodic arc sources and gas ion sources, and intense ion and electron beams. These technologies will be presented.

<P><B>9:45 am
<P>THE JET DEPOSITION PROCESS: NEW TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS:</B> <I>Brett Halpern</I>, Jet Process Corporation, 24 Science Park, New Haven, CT 06511
<P>
Development of the &quot;sonic jet sources in low vacuum&quot; theme enables the Jet Vapor Deposition<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> process (JVD<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP>) to make a wide range of thin film materials. Thus, we have developed jet sources, driven in the 0.1-10 torr range by mechanical pumps, for deposition of metals, semiconductors, oxides, nitrides, alloys and guest-host materials in multicomponent and multilayer form. These sources combine high rate, high efficiency, and low temperature operation with excellent control of microstructure. For example, we recently described and patented an &quot;electron-jet, or e-jet<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> &quot;source, which combines metal thermal vaporization with an intense thermionic plasma and allows high rate deposition of metals, oxides and nitrides coupled with simultaneous ion bombardment at high flux and low energy. JVD's versatility opens new approaches to problems in electronic, automotive, aerospace, corrosion resistance and optical applications. In this talk we review the principles of JVD, new jet source developments, JVD's advantages over conventional CVD and PVD and recent commercial applications.

DoD ACTIVITIES IN ION BEAM PROCESSING: </B> <I>James K. Hirvonen</I>, Metals Research Branch, U.S. Army Research Laboratory, AMSRL-WM-ME, APG, MD 21005-5069
<P>
<P>The use of energetic ion beams for beneficially modifying the surface sensitive properties of critical military material has been pursued within DoD now for almost two decades demonstrating improved material properties including increased wear-, fatigue-, corrosion-, and oxidation-resistance. High dose ion implantation has been demonstrated to be technically suitable for extending the lifetime of precision aerospace bearings (U.S. Navy) and specific cutting tools (U.S. Army). Ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD) processing has increased both the number and the variety of DoD applications, including robust optical coatings and coatings for wear, corrosion and fatigue improvements. A DoD program exploring these benign, dry, ion beam techniques for supplanting the wet Cr/Cd electroplating processing is currently underway at the National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence in Johnstown, PA. This program includes the scheduled installation, (Fall 96) of a large ion beam system for the processing of selected DoD components. The status of this program and other recent DoD ion beam efforts will be discussed.

<P>SURFACE PROCESSING BY GAS CLUSTER ION BEAMS:</B> <I> Allen Kirkpatrick</I>, Epion Corporation, Bedford, MA 01730
<P>
<P>Clusters consisting of hundreds or thousands of weakly bound atoms can be formed from various gases by expanding the gas through a small nozzle into high vacuum. The clusters can be ionized and subjected to acceleration potentials so as to produce beams of cluster ions which possess high total energy, mass and momentum in combination with low energy per constituent atom. Cluster ion beams have been shown to be capable of producing processing effects which have not been available with monomer ions. A number of prospective applications for gas cluster ions have been identified and commercial gas cluster ion beam equipment is now being developed. This paper will review the current status of gas cluster ion technology and will include discussion of methods for generation of the gas cluster beams, kinetics of the interactions of cluster ions with solid materials, anticipated applications and available equipment.

COMPARISON OF DEPOSITION TECHNOLOGIES FOR ION ASSISTED COATINGS</B> <I>A.J. Armini</I>, S.N. Bunker, L.A. Stelmack, Implant Sciences Corporation
<P>
The current ion assisted coating methods and the corresponding equipment are compared, for depositing a variety of wear and/or corrosion resistant coatings. Ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD), unbalanced magnetron sputtering, and cathodic arc processes were used to deposit coatings of amorphous diamond, chromium, and noble metals for various applications in the aerospace, biomedical, and industrial markets. The three techniques were compared with respect to coating uniformity, deposition rate, adhesion, and microstructure. Coatings were evaluated for hardness, adhesion, smoothness, sliding wear, and friction coefficient. Coating-substrate adhesion was measured using the diamond scratch test. Wear and friction were measured against several opposing materials, using a high speed, high temperature pin-on-disk instrument. Scale-up issues and the suitability of each technology for various production applications will be discussed.

Electrically conducting metal oxides find potential applications in electrochemical systems such as batteries and fuel cells. For example, several lithium insertion compounds are used as cathodes in rechargeable lithium batteries. However, the battery performance and cyclability of the cathodes are controlled partly by the microstructure and morphology, which in turn are influenced by the methods of synthesis and processing used. A novel approach involving the reduction of aqueous metallate solutions with aqueous alkali metal borohydrides at ambient temperatures to obtain amorphous or nanocrystalline transition metal oxide electrodes will be presented. The electrode performance of, for example, amorphous or nanocrystalline VO2, CrO2, MoO2, and LiMn2O4 will be discussed. In addition, the design and synthesis of perovskite-based metal oxides that exhibit mixed electronic and ionic conductivity will be presented. These mixed conductors are attractive not only as electrode materials for solid oxide fuel cells but also for oxygen separation membranes and catalysts.

<P>EPITAXIAL THIN FILMS AND HETEROSTRUCTURES OF METALLIC OXIDES FOR DEVICE APPLICATIONS:</B> <I>C.B. Eom</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708
<P>
For many electronic device applications, it is necessary to have epitaxial growth of metallic oxide thin films in a single heterostructure. We have grown epitaxial thin films of Sr1-xCaxRuO3 and La6.4Sr1.6Cu8O20 in-situ by 90 degree off-axis sputtering. These metallic oxides are pseudo-cubic perovskites, which could be ideal electrodes for ferroelectric devices, and normal metal barriers for SNS junctions in integrated superconducting devices. However, the properties of epitaxial thin films of the metallic oxides may be quite different from the corresponding bulk materials because of the existence of strain and cation disorder in the films. We have observed a strain stabilized metal-insulator transition in epitaxial Sr1-xCaxRuO3 thin films deposited on (100) SrTiO3 substrates that differed in crystalline quality. The growth mechanisms of the films and their correlation with the crystalline quality of the substrates is discussed. We have also grown epitaxial planar SNS heterostructures YBCO/La6.4Sr1.6Cu8O20/YBCO. We will discuss the microstructures, junction properties and the origin of the interface resistance between YBCO and La6.4Sr1.6Cu8O20.

<P>FUNDAMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS OF CADMIUM STANNATE THIN FILMS:</B> <I>T.J. Coutts</I>, W.P. Mulligan, X. Wu, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO 80215
<P>
We are investigating a variety of novel transparent conductive oxides, including cadmium stannate (Cd2SnO4), cadmium indate (CdIn2O4), zinc stannate (Zn2SnO4 and ZnSnO3), and zinc indium oxide (Zn2In2O5). To date, the cadmium stannate films have shown the highest conductivity, with resistivities as low as 1.3X10-4 ohm-cm. Films have been fabricated with sheet resistances as low 2 ohm/sq., while maintaining approximately 80% transmittance across the visible and near infrared. The conductivity of the films is high because of both high electron concentration and relatively high electron mobility. One possible explanation for the high mobility is that the electron effective mass is unusually low. Direct measurement of the effective mass by cyclotron resonance is not feasible due to the extremely short electron scattering times characteristic of these highly defective materials. Instead, we have estimated effective mass by Drude modelling of optical reflectance and transmittance data, and by analysis of a combination of electron transport measurements, including resistivity, Hall effect, thermopower, and transverse Nernst-Ettingshausen effect. Cadmium stannate films with a range of carrier concentrations were fabricated, and their optical and transport properties were measured. We will present the results of our comparative analysis of carrier effective mass by these two independent methods. Possible conduction band curvature, and carrier scattering time and mechanisms will also be reported. The implications for design of novel transparent conductive oxides will be discussed.

It has been known for two decades that polymers with extended conjugation could be rendered highly conductive by doping, that is, by oxidizing or reducing the polymer chain. The commercialization of these polymers has, however, been limited by their poor chemical stability in the doped form. More recently these polymers have shown promise when used in their undoped forms in LEDs, light emitting diodes, or in thin film transistors. This talk will cover the recent developments in these two areas and describe the scientific challenges which still remain.

The properties of conducting polymers have stimulated much interest in many fields of research and considerable effort has been directed towards reliable characterization of the envisaged properties for commercial applications. Apart from polyacetylene (PA) the major existing conducting polymers can be electrochemically synthesized and this encouraged the use of conventional electrochemical methods coupled to other techniques to study the electropolymerization and insulator/conductor conversion of these new materials. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the ability of optical methods to provide useful information on the properties of electronically conducting polymers. Three techniques will be focused and their contribution illustrated considering different systems: 1. The principles of the Probe Beam Deflection (also known as Mirage Effect) and respective data for polyaniline (PANI) systems discussed. 2. Recent applications of Photocurrent Spectroscopy are reviewed and photoeffects displayed by poly-3-methylthiophene (P3MeTh) analysed. 3. The information on structural changes during electropolymerization and doping processes, which can be provided by ellipsometry evidenced by the study of PANI, P3MeTh and polypyrrole.

<P>
High strength, high conductivity copper-niobium wire is a promising conductor wire for use in pulsed high field magnets. Due to the high melting point of niobium, it is difficult to produce an ingot with a fine, homogeneous structure. One possibility for reducing the scale of the cast structure, improving the homogeneity of the ingot, and enhancing the strength at a given level of deformation strain is to use rapid solidification techniques, such as powder processing, to fabricate the Cu-Nb ingot. Both melt spinning and gas atomization of Cu-Nb are difficult due to problems associated with thermal shock of components, such as crucibles and stopper rods. Spark erosion provides a method for powder production without the use of components which may crack under thermal stresses. Furthermore, in the spark erosion process quench rates exceeding 106 K/s from temperatures above 104 K promote formation of fine particles with homogeneous composition. Spark eroded Cu-10 vol % Nb powder has been consolidated by cold pressing and subsequently hydrostatically extruded to form 2.5 cm diameter rod with a yield strength of 500 MPa and a conductivity of 85% IACS at a reduction of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/epsilon.gif">=2.6.

Measurements of CO2, CO, COS and CS2 emissions in collected gas samples by GC-MS and of SO2 by ion chromatography of scrubber solutions allowed us to complete a carbon and sulphur mass balance for P155 pre-bake electrolysis cells. COS and CS2 emissions were confirmed by continuous analysis using tunable diode laser absorption spectrometry of the flue cases from 64 cells over a two day period. While the volume mixing ratios of COS and CS2 of the flue gases agree with those reported recently for a German prebake smelter, the specific emissions were found to be considerably lower.

<P>
The generation of CF4 and C2F6 is being studied in a laboratory-scale aluminum reduction cell. During electrolysis in well behaved cells and in cells on anode effect, anode gases have been analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) on-line. Process parameters have been systematically varied to determine how PFC generation depends upon anode material (industrial pre-bake and S&oslash;derberg), bath ratio (1.45, 1.15 and 0.56), LiF concentration (0 and 2.7%), current density (0.7 A cm-2 and higher), and temperature (970 and 800&#176;C). Measurements agree with those reported for industrial cells with respect to total PFC level as well as the ratio of CF4 to C2F6. The main factor determining PFC concentration appears to be the anodic overvoltage. The functional relationship between the rate of PFC generation and anodic overvoltage is derived from the current-overpotential equation.

It has been established that CF4 and C2F6 are given off from the Hall-Heroult electrolysis cells during so-called anode effects. The introduction of a novel alumina feeding and cell operation algorithm in the Grande Baie smelter operating with P155 pre-bake electrolysis cells, has dramatically reduced the anode effect duration and anode effect frequency. The implementation of the new cell control logic constituted a unique opportunity to compare data from some two hundred events before and after commissioning on identical cells. Using tunable diode laser absorption spectrometry we measured PFC emissions from individual anode effects with a temporal resolutions of as little as 8 seconds. This communication will describe the experimental set-up, present the decrease in PFC emissions attained, discuss the CF4/C2F6 ratios observed and compare the data observed with model predictions.

<P>
The laser hydrogen fluoride measuring instrument described at TMS '95 was compared with an optimised eighty-fold array of air sampling cassettes over a 400m path in a potroom of the Tomago (NSW) aluminium smelter. Thirteen one-hour comparison trials were performed at average HF concentrations over the range 0.07-3.7 mg/Nm3. For the twelve concentrations up to 2.0 mg/Nm3 the cassette array average and the laser average correlated with a slope of 0.93 and a regression coefficient r2=0.98. For the nine points up to 1.5 mg/Nm3 the slope was 1.02 and the regression coefficient r2=0.99. As configured during the comparison trial the laser instrument did not correctly indicate the 3.7 mg/Nm3 HF concentration due to insufficient signal to noise ratio. The correlation between array and laser was considered very good. The technique is being commercialised.

The introduction of integrated Pollution Control (IPC) by means of the Environmental Protection Act (EPA 90), has brought with it regulatory requirements for operators of industrial processes in the U.K. to undertake continuous monitoring of gaseous atmospheric releases. In response to these changes Anglesey Aluminium Metal Limited (AAM) has chosen to install Tunable Diode Laser Spectroscopy (TDLAS). This method, operating in the Middle Infra Red region (MIR), is gaining increased acceptance as the choice for trace gas measurement where sensitivity, specificity, and fast response are required.

An advanced process for removal and recovery of fluorides and particulates from the aluminium reduction pot gas has been developed and tested in pilot plant prior to full scale installation. The dry scrubbing process is arranged in two stages with a counter-current flow of the alumina allowing for the reactive fresh alumina at the tail end of the process. The benefits and features of this concept include high process flexibility with stable and improved performance on removal of fluorides, reduced pressure drop and low particulate emission by optimized filter design and operating performance, and improved compactness through design and equipment developments.

<P>The fluorine emissions from modern PFPB pots have led to a requirement to further improve gas scrubbing efficiency. This improvement has been achieved without any detrimental effect on scaling or attrition of alumina. Economic factors create a further technical challenge of reducing capital cost and lowering energy consumption. A novel process called the TGT-RI which combines an innovative reactor concept integrated in a new generation of fabric filter fully responds to the new requirements of aluminium producers. Several years of exhaustive tests have been conducted on gases emitted by large pots to develop the TGT filter and then the TGT-RI concept of integrating the reactor within the filter unit. The paper will incorporate a comprehensive set of test results. A descriptive of the first industrial applications on pot gases and baking furnaces is presented.

Complex interfaces can be described as a distribution of interfacial patches, each having a differential area. The patches are fully characterized by a mean curvature, a dimensionless shape factor, and an extensive variable such as solid angle or area. Using this approach, a statistical theory of Ostwald ripening has been extended to describe the diffusion-limited coarsening of non-spherical convex interfaces. Coarsening rate constants are calculated as a function of both the precipitate volume fraction and the geometric shape factor. Application of these results to ripening of ellipsoidal precipitates and other morphologies will be discussed.

<P>
Ultra fine scale precipitates are the leading cause to the irradiation embrittlement of reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels and may limit the continued operation or extended life of a number of nuclear power plants around the world. Tremendous effort in studying these precipitates has been made using various experimental techniques such as small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and atom probe field ion microscope (APFIM). However, detailed identity and characteristic of the precipitates o atomic scale are not well known. We propose a self-consistent model, combining advanced thermodynamics, small angle neutron scattering measurements, and Lattice Monte Carlo simulations, to examine detailed identity and characteristic of the ultra fine precipitates on atomic scale in Fe-based multicomponent systems Fe-Cu-Ni-Mn and Fe-Cu-Ni-Mn-Si. A systematic parametric study using both the metallurgical and simulation variables is carried out. Interaction parameters in an extended regular solution treatment, composition, and temperature as the metallurgical variables, and starting configurations, sizes of simulation cells, and simulation duration as the simulation variables, are exercised. The results from the simulations are in good agreement with those from SANS and APFIM.

<P>
Marangoni convection has a large effect on materials processing since it remarkably promotes heat and mass transport near the free interface. In order to clarify the behavior of marangoni convection in a molten salt, observation and calculation of the thermal convection in a column held between a pair of Pt disks (2mm in diameter) which were fixed to hot thermocouples, were carried out. Calculated flow patterns and absolute values of fluid velocity agreed well with the observed results. When the temperatures of both disks were set equal and the height of liquid bridge was 2.4mm, four vortexes were generated on the longitudinal plane and typical velocity was 15mm/s. From the calculated isothermal lines the behavior of promotion of heat transport is obvious; fluid heated at the disks was conveyed to the free surface and fluid cooled at the surface was conveyed to the inner region. Increase in the height of column and/or increase in the absolute value of applied temperature difference lead to increase in fluid velocity lineally in this calculation range.

<P>
Mixing phenomena in a bottom blown air-stirred one-seventh water model of CLU (Creusot-Loire Uddeholm) reactor was studied using three different configurations of straight circular nozzles fitted axially at the bottom of the vessel. The mixing time has been experimentally determined utilizing acid injection and pH measurements at various gas flow rates, bath heights and nozzle orientations in the presence and in the absence of a second phase. High air flow rates were utilized usually above the range of ordinary flow meters. During experiments the air flow rates varied from 0.00599m3/sec to 0.01465m3/sec. An integral orifice plate assembly, which is coupled to two pressure transmitters, was constructed to calculate gas flow rates from pressure readings. Experimental results reveal that the mixing time decreases with increasing gas flow rate. A critical gas flow rate exists after which the mixing time tends to increase for all tuyere configurations studied. For a given gas flow rate the mixing time increases non-linearly with increasing bath height. Off-center configuration gives slightly lower mixing times as compared to center configuration. The presence of an upper oil layer increases the mixing time significantly for all configurations showing its resistance to the recirculatory velocity of fluid near the surface of the bath. Under the very high flow rates employed in this investigation, it is found that the contribution of buoyancy to the total stirring energy density is very small, but its contribution increases with increasing bath height.

The stresses required in an axial closed die forging are determined by the geometry of the blank and that of the die, the yield stress of the working material and the process variables like temperature, strain, strain rate, friction, etc. Five adimensional groups of the mentioned parameters are proposed. Like the Reynolds number, they permit the characterization and evaluation of almost any axial forging process. A wide data base is experimentally obtained, which validates the model. This dimensional analysis is an alternative to the traditional methods for calculating the stresses in metal forming.

Liquidus temperature and electrical conductivity data measured on synthetic slags were modeled by the use of neural nets(NN). In this work the applied multilayer feedforward NNs were trained by a conjugate-gradient optimization for which a three layer formulation was used. Very good fits were obtained for both the liquidus temperature and the conductivity data. The synthetic slags were prepared from pure oxides to represent a wide range of compositions likely to be encountered in ferromanganese and silicomanganese smelting. The slag constituents were in the following range: MnO, 5-30%; CaO, 20-35%; MgO, 5-15%; SiO2, 27-58%; and Al2O3, 5%. Liquidus temperatures varied from 1300&#176;C to 1380&#176;C and increased with increasing basicity ratio. The electrical resistivity of slags decreased with the increase of basicity ratio from 0.55 to 1.1 but above 1.1 basicity ratio the resistivity tended to increase depending upon the MnO content.

<P>
A high current density operation is desired to improve the productivity in copper electrorefining. However, a lot of problems still remain such as passivation of anode, dendritic deposition of cathode and contamination of impurity elements during the high current density electrorefining of copper. To clear the problems mentioned above, effects of the fluid velocity of the electrolyte on the morphology of copper deposition on cathode and the passivation behaviour of anode have been investigated at various current densities in the present study. Although a granular appearance of the copper deposition was obtained with increasing the current density, it was depressed by an increase of the fluid velocity of the electrolyte. Then an uniform deposition on the cathode was also observed when the fluid velocity of it became higher. Further more, no passivation behaviour of anode could be found by high speed circulating the electrolyte even in the high current density operation.

<P>
The energy consumption, in the electrowinning step of copper production by hydrometallurgical traditional process, generally represents more than 1/4 of the total energy requirement. The considerable saving can be achieved just in this step that requires about 8 GJ/tonne of the produced copper. To save energy the cell voltage, or more appropriately its anodic component, can be reduced: that is because the anodic voltage represents the main component of cell voltage and so it is responsible for the actual energy consumption in the copper sulphate electrowinning. In this work some ways are studied to lower the anodic voltage. First the cobalt ions were added to the sulphate solution in order to study the catalytic effect on oxygen discharge. Then lead alloys anodes (Pb-Ag, Pb-Sb-Ag and Pb-Ca) were used to promote a better oxygen evolution as a result of a different anodic surface. Their behaviour was compared with the Pb-Sb traditional ones. Finally, as already pointed out by several authors for zinc electrowinning, ethylene glycol was employed as anodic depolarizer in order to verify its effectiveness in the case of copper electrowinning. Combining all the above-mentioned ways energy saving ranging from 20% to 27% is achieved. All the tests were carried out on a laboratory pilot-plant for long time to simulate the industrial conditions.

Auto-stripping machine was developed and installed in 1971. Major modifications were performed in 1981 such as relocating conveyor lines, changing the stripping devise and stacking unit of stripped sheets and others. In 1988 stainless steel blanks with Edge Wise Protector which is highly efficient edge masking plastics were introduced from Mitsubishi Materials Corporation. Then the blank polishing machine and durable plastics for EWP were developed to improve stripability. Not only tremendous cost savings of labors, maintenance, supplies and others but also good quality of the starting sheets were attained and the capacity of cathode production was increased. According to the recent results of operation, the speed and the sheet production rate of stripping machine are 5.5 seconds per blank and 7,000 sheets per day respectively. The operation of commercial tanks is also satisfactory, of which current efficiency is keeping 98-99% at the tankhouses #1 &2 and 95-97% at the tankhouse #3.

The influence of the copper electrocrystallization inhibitors (mainly 
thiourea, gelatin and chloride ions) is studied in a new fully automatic pilot plan. 
This paper describes the conception and the building of this plan. The plan is 
in hydrodynamic similitude with an industrial copper electrorefining plan. 
Three cells with forced electrolyte flow may be connected in parallel or in series 
on order to model the copper production cells. The electrolyte is 
characterized chemically and electrochemically before and after electrolysis. One day 
and one week long experiments are performed. The structure of the deposits 
is characterized by SEM, EDX and metallographic cross-sections. The 
new approach for the study of these inhibitors is firstly to reproduce the 
experimental conditions observed in the industry with the three additives 
present simultaneously in the electrolyte and secondly to study the influence of 
a slight modification of the concentration of one inhibitor, the others 
being present in the electrolyte with their industrial nominal concentrations.

<P>
Electrochemical techniques are a valuable means of analyzing the passivation of commercial copper anodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) provides information concerning transport and reaction phenomena occurring at an electrode surface. Commercial copper anodes of varying compositions have been examined using EIS. Experiments were conducted in a flat cell with an electrolyte of 40 g/l Cu2+ and 160 g/l H2SP4 maintained at 65&#176;C. Impedance spectra were obtained at the potentials characteristic of the open circuit voltage and the passive region for each anode. The spectra of the passivating films exhibited a flattened resistive/capacitive loop at middle to high frequencies and an inductive loop at low frequencies. An equivalent circuit utilizing an inductor-resistor series in parallel with the double layer capacitance and charge transfer resistance was adequate in modeling the impedance data. The influence of anodes impurities on the components of the equivalent circuit is discussed and correlated with a <I>bilayer passivation</I> model.

A statistically designed screening test was carried out in the absence and presence of 20 ppm Cl- ions using a three factor, two-level factorial design in an electrolyte containing 36 gl-1 Cu2+ and 150 gl-1 sulfuric acid. The independent variables evaluated were agitation, current density and temperature; their influence on surface roughness was determined. Using the data generated, a model expression was developed to allow estimation of surface roughness of the copper deposits. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and profilometer techniques were used in the evaluation. The copper deposited at current densities where activation was the primary control mechanism appeared similar in morphology whether stirring was used or not. The addition of 20 ppm Cl- ions to the electrolyte gave rougher deposits under the same conditions. In the mixed control regions, where mass transfer effects were initiated, considerably rougher and more dendritic deposits were obtained when Cl- ions were present. Agitation was effective in reducing the copper surface roughness both in the apparent activation and mixed control regions in the presence of Cl- ions. The results of this study showed that 20 ppm Cl- polarized the copper deposition at low overpotentials but caused depolarization at higher overpotentials, and promoted roughening even where Cu2+ mass transfer was not a factor.

<P>THREE-DIMENSIONAL CALCULATION OF CURRENT DISTRIBUTION IN ELECTRODEPOSITION OF COPPER:</B> Y.S. Choi, N.S. Kim, S.H. Jeon, T. Kang, Seoul National University, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, Seoul, Korea; H.J. Sohn, Seoul National University, Department of Mineral and Petroleum Engineering, Seoul, Korea<P>

The thickness uniformity of electrodeposits depends largely on the current density distribution over the cathode. The current distribution is determined by the geometrical characteristics of the electrodes and the cell, the polarization at the electrode surface and the mass transfer in the electrolyte. The calculation of the current distribution is possible by various numerical techniques, among which the boundary element method (BEM) is considered to be most efficient. In this study the program for the calculation of 3-dimensional current distribution by use of the BEM with a linear element of trigonal type was developed and applied to the rectangular cathodes in copper electroplating. For simplicity the anode potential was assumed to be constant and the nonlinear polarization curves obtained from the potentiodynamic experiments were fitted to a linear equation over the range of current densities, 20~80mA/cm2. The effect of the cell dimension and the anode shape on current distribution was simulated. The calculated values agreed fairly well with the measured values and the thickness uniformity could be improved by the proper combination of the cell geometry and the anode shape.

<P>
Southern Peru Limited's Ilo Refinery, the largest in Peru, began operations in 1975 with a production capacity of 165,000 stpy. Southern Peru bought the Refinery from the state owned Minero Peru S.A. on June 1, 1994. The refinery processes blister from Southern Peru's Ilo smelter. Blister copper is processed in an anode plant equipped with two 365 st. tilting reverberatory furnaces, a 26 mold casting wheel and an anode press machine. Copper is electrorefined in a tank house equipped with 768 commercial cells, 44 stripper cells and 40 liberator cells, utilizing two electrolyte circuits and a 21,000 ampere rectifier. During 1989 through 1994, a program for improving productivity was carried out by increasing the number of cells and increasing current density to the total rectifier capacity. As a result, a capacity of 215,000 stpy of refined copper, 2 million troy ounces of silver and 6,000 troy ounces of gold per year was achieved. In 1994, Southern Peru announced plans to increase the capacity to 250,000 stpy of cathode with a US$ 18 million investment and a US$2 million investment in environmental improvement projects, as part of the purchase agreement with the Peruvian government. This paper outlines the scope of the Southern Peru Limited refinery modernization and environmental program. It describes the implementation of the electrolytic plant expansion based on installation of polymer concrete cells, a new rectifier, a new selenium roaster and a precious metal plant upgrades.

Many different types of furnaces are used in aluminum industry for melting and treating the metal. Sidewell furnaces are commonly used for scrap melting. Metal flow in the furnace is provided by different types of equipment such as pumps and impellers, and plays an important role in furnace performance. A three-dimensional model has been developed to simulate the metal flow in such furnaces. In this paper, the model will be described, and the results will be presented showing how various operating and design parameters such as impeller position and rotational speed, sidewell geometry and arch design affect the metal flow.

A series of laboratory tests were conducted to explore the reaction of bath with Al-Mg alloys, as may occur when Hall bath enters ingot furnaces in a smelter-supplied ingot plant. Results showed that Mg clearly reacts with bath and adds Na and Ca to the metal by the reactions: 2(Na3AlF6) + 3 <U>Mg</U> <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/arrow-right.gif"> 6 <U>Na</U> + 2 AlF3 + 3 MgF2 (1) and CaF2 + <U>Mg</U> <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/arrow-right.gif"> <U>Ca</U> + MgF2 (2) Temperature, Mg concentration in the alloy, the quantity of bath added to the metal, and the particle size of the bath added all influenced the reaction. At 700&#176;C the Na and Ca pick-ups that occurred from these reactions were approximately 15 ppm while at 900&#176;C the pick-ups were greater than 300 ppm. The pick-ups increased with increasing quantity of bath up to a limiting amount, beyond which no further pick-up occurred. The variation of the reaction with particle size indicated that the reaction is limited by the available bath-metal surface area.

<P>
An analysis of the effects of alloy additions on the grain refinement in a 
series of model and commercial aluminium alloy compositions is reported. The 
data of Birch and Fisher published earlier describing grain refinement in 32 
systems, including AA3004, AA5083, AA6063 and AA7050, are considered 
in terms of the supercooling effect of each alloy addition. A simple model 
describing grain size in terms of additive supercooling effects of individual 
alloy additions is proposed which fits the data reasonably well. Deviations 
from simple additive behaviour are evident in systems where strong 
intermetallic interactions occur. Interaction coefficients amongst solutes are invoked 
to explain these deviations. Individual alloying effects on grain refinement 
are treated in terms of constitutional supercooling parameters and behaviour 
is shown to be similar to that described in earlier studies. Zirconium is shown 
to have a general poisoning effect in a range of alloy compositions.

The performance characteristics of the HYCAST Rotor has been investigated in a water model. The removal rate of oxygen from water is measured for a large number of operational conditions. By combining different techniques the energy dissipation in the reactor, the mass transfer at the top surface and the bubble sizes may be determined experimentally. Investigations of the bubble dynamics by high speed video show that the bubbles in this type of reactors are very different from what is hitherto believed. Based on such a picture the paper demonstrates that the mass transfer and bubble sizes in the HYCAST Unit may be explained by a relatively simple theory which seems to explain all available experimental data. It is also demonstrated how we from this theory can scale from the oxygen removal in water model to hydrogen removal in liquid aluminum.

<P>
A two dimensional mathematical model for the development of macrosegregation at and close to the ingot surface during DC casting of rolling slabs is presented. The model accounts for macrosegregation caused by exudation of interdendritic melt and macrosegregation associated with solidification shrinkage. Equations for the conservation of energy, solute, momentum, and mass during the stationary phase of the process are solved numerically by a finite element method in a solution domain defined by a vertical cross section of the ingot. The main simplifications in the modelling concept are to assume the solidified part of the mushy zone to move with the casting speed, and to consider a binary alloy solidifying according to the lever rule. The thickness and solute concentration of the surface layer and the macrosegregation close to the surface are calculated, and modelling results are compared with measurements on real castings.

<P>
By combining empirical results with a dimensional analysis, a model for the prediction of pull-in during DC-casting of aluminium sheet ingots is constructed. The model predicts the steady state pull-in along the rolling faces of an ingot. By using an alloy dependent constant, the nominal geometry and the casting speed, the model can easily calculate a near optimal mould shape. It is also possible to calculate the resulting shape of the rolling faces of an ingot for a given mould geometry, alloy constant and casting speed. The model requires only a spread sheet for these calculations. Comparisons with experiments show a very good agreement. The best fit values of the alloy constant for several commercial aluminium alloys are presented. The value of this constant varies within 12%.

<P>
The pull-in phenomenon apparent in the DC-casting process of aluminium sheet ingots is investigated both analytically and by use of numerical models calculating temperatures, strains and stresses. The major part of the pull-in takes place above the bottom of the sump, but is mainly caused by thermal contractions and deformations in regions below. The strong and almost exactly linear dependency of the pull-in on the casting speed is explained. The effects on the pull-in of different cooling conditions and of various thermophysical and thermomechanical properties are investigated. 2D plain strain approximations have been successfully applied in calculating the pull-in for the centre part of the rolling face, but 3D effects are significant close to the narrow ingot surface. This is illustrated by comparison of results from 3D and 2D calculations. Modelling results are also compared with measurements of ingot thickness variations. A very good agreement is obtained.

The intensity of the water cooling in direct chill casting affects the process heat flow and the performance of the casting process. The intensity depends on the boiling behaviour on the ingot surface. The basic mechanisms of boiling, the different boiling modes (nucleate, unstable film and stable film boiling), the effect of water composition, temperature, flow and velocity on boiling behaviour and heat transfer are reviewed.

<P>
The numerical simulation of DC casting requires a good knowledge of the heat transfer between ingot and cooling water. This is especially true for the starting phase, where most defects are initiated. An experimental set-up has been developed to characterize this heat exchange close to process operating conditions. The method is based on the measurement of the cooling of a preheated instrumented aluminium block quenched by a water curtain. A 2D transient inverse model allows to determine the distribution of heat transfer coefficient and temperature on the whole surface of the block. In this way, heat flux can be assessed both at the water impingement point and below. The results obtained with the experimental apparatus are in good agreement with heat transfer rates calculated from in-situ temperature measurements using cast-in thermocouples. This device is thus an efficient and economical method to determine the influence of cooling water characteristics on the law describing heat transfer coefficient as a function of surface temperature. These laws have been measured and introduced in a numerical simulation of DC casting in order to study the effect of water cooling and casting parameters on the thermal evolution of the ingot during the different phases of casting.

<P>
Aluminum used beverage cans (UBC) should be cleaned to completely remove all organic and residues to maximize metal recovery on remelting. This process must also minimize oxide formation. The aluminum industry uses three principal decoating technologies. The most used is the rotary kiln. The other processes are the belt decoater and the fluidized bed decoater. The presentation will cover the fundamental science for decoating shredded UBC to minimize metal loss on remelting. Laboratory work and plant trials have shown the requirements for complete decoating. These are: correct temperature range for the coatings to be pyrolized, good process gas to shred contact for all the scrap, sufficient oxygen being present to complete the oxidation of the carbon compounds present. The basic principles of the three decoating technologies used for the decoating of UBC will be discussed in relation to how they correspond to the fundamental process requirements.

<P>
When analyzing diffusion measurements, the diffusion coefficient is often assumed to be independent of composition and time. In this paper, studies of possible deviations from this simple picture will be reported. During amorphous alloy growth in an elemental diffusion couple, the amorphous phase has a wide homogeneity range, and the interdiffusion coefficient is unlikely to be uniform. Experimental results in Ni-Hf thin-film couples will be described, which indicate that the interdiffusion coefficient varies significantly with composition. This variation leads to significant systematic errors in determining the interfacial compositions from measured composition profiles. A more reliable measurement method will be presented. A number of authors have suggested that evolution of macrostress during amorphization by interdiffusion affects the rate of the latter. Using a combination of substrate curvature and lattice parameter measurements, we have determined the evolution of stress during interdiffusion in Ni-Hf thin-film couples. The amorphous phase is observed to form under large tensile stress, which relaxes by creep during subsequent growth. Neither this stress, nor that induced by ion irradiation, affects the interdiffusion coefficient.

The sintering of small assemblies of nanoparticles has been investigated by a combination of molecular dynamics computer simulations and in situ observations in a UHV transmission electron microscope. Because the radius of curvature of nanoparticles is so small, enormously large interfacial stresses are developed when nanoparticles come in contact with other nanoparticles or substrates, and this leads to sintering by plastic deformation of the particles on the time scale of some picoseconds. Surprisingly, these particles rotate and form twins and other low energy configurations. Several examples of such sintering will be illustrated, including nanoparticle assemblies of Cu, amorphous alloys and intermetallic compounds. Interactions between nanoparticles and substrates will also be discussed.

<P>EFFECT OF FREE SURFACES ON THE KINETICS AND MORPHOLOGY OF SPINODAL DECOMPOSITION:</B> <I> Long-Qing Chen,</I> Materials Science and Engineering, Penn State University, University Park, PA 16802
<P>
The kinetics of spinodal decomposition and morphological evolution near a crystalline surface were investigated by microscopic master equations in the point and pair approximations and a second-neighbor interaction model. Both two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D model systems were considered. It is shown that, in the presence of a surface, spinodal decomposition initially involves surface segregation, followed by anisotropic decomposition in the near-surface region, and then followed by isotropic decomposition in the bulk. It is demonstrated that, due to segregation, a surface spinodal decomposition may take place for alloys whose overall average compositions are outside the bulk spinodal. It is found that the presence of a surface results in a dominant concentration wave which produces interesting transient morphological patterns such as distorted hexagonal precipitate lattices for relatively low-volume fractions and straight stripes at high volume fractions in the near-surface region. The relevance of these results to the mechanisms of diffusional phase transformations, such as spinodal ordering and decomposition, in nanoscale crystalline materials will be discussed.

This presentation describes self-propagating, exothermic reactions in nanoscale, multilayer materials. The talk begins with a review of self-propagating reactions in powder-based materials and then focuses on similar exothermic reactions in multilayer foils. The multilayer foils consist of alternate layers of materials that have high heats of mixing, such as Al and Ni. The individual layers (of Al or Ni) are only nanometers thick, but hundreds of these layers are sputter deposited to form one foil with a total thickness between 10 and 100 microns. The layered foils arc easily removed from their substrates, and their exothermic mixing can be started at room temperature with a small spark. Te exothermic reactions propagate al speeds greater than 10m/s and they reach final temperatures as high us 1600&#176;C The reactions can propagate in air, vacuum, or liquids. The velocities, the heats, and the temperatures of the reactions will be presented for at least two different multilayer systems, and the chemical and structural parameters that control these properties will be addressed using an analytical model. The final segment of the talk will describe how reactive multilayer foils can be used as local heat sources to joint structural components.

Membranes are often fabricated from palladium since it has a very high hydrogen permselectivity. Diffusion through the metal is often the rate-limiting step in hydrogen transport through palladium-based membranes. The flux through these membranes can be increased by tailoring a microstructure that allows for higher hydrogen diffusivity. Nanostructured palladium has a much higher hydrogen diffusivity than conventional palladium due to its large volume fraction of grain boundaries. Thus, nanostructured metal membranes would provide higher hydrogen fluxes and better performance. By doping palladium with another element, enhanced stability against grain growth, stability against the alpha to beta phase transition which causes cracking, and enhanced poisoning resistance can be achieved. In this study nanostructured pure palladium and palladium alloy membranes were synthesized by pulsed electrodeposition. The hydrogen permselectivity through these materials was determined in a membrane reactor and the effect of common poisons (e.g. carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide) on hydrogen diffusivity was also measured to relate the hydrogen permeation properties of these materials to their microstructure and elemental composition.

The trends of microelectronic devices have advanced to the state that they operate in excess of 200 MHz with submicron feature size. Furthermore, these high performance IC requires Inputs/Outputs (I/O) signals that are in excess of a few 1000's. Low-cost, high performance flip-chip, area array solder joint interconnects are key to the success of this technology. In order to enhance the thermal cycle fatigue-life of these solder joints, underfill encapsulants are needed.

The emerging new technologies provide ever more challenges to assure the reliability of electronic products. The ever increasing demands in electronic products for higher performance, lower cost, less space (weight) is leading to ever denser interconnection needs. Solder joint reliability is becoming an even more important issue with the advent of new surface mount packages and the use of surface mounted electronics in such hostile environments as the automobile and space. The new packages are characterized by larger sizes, finer pitches, and/or problematic materials which require an up-front 'Design for Reliability (DfR)' to meet reliability requirements. The hostile environments can include thermal excursions over temperature ranges in which multiple interactive damage mechanisms are operative. The reliability of electronic assemblies requires a definitive design effort that has to be carried out concurrently with the other design functions during the developmental phase of the product. There exists a misconception in the industry, that quality manufacturing is all that is required to assure the reliability of an electronic assembly. While of course, consistent high quality manufacturing - and all that this implies is a necessary prerequisite to assure the reliability of the product, only a DfR-procedure can assure that the design - manufactured to good quality - will be reliable in its intended application. Explicit DfR-procedures need to be employed to account and compensate, at least in part, for the prevalent damage mechanisms. This needs to be complemented with 'Design for Manufacturability (DfM)' which widens the process windows and takes into account the manufacturing capabilities. These demands put an increasing burden on the designers who will require a heightened technical understanding of the underlying issues and more sophisticated design tools. Thus, adherence to quality standards, such as IPC-A-620, <I>Acceptability of Electronic Assemblies with Surface Mount Technologies</I>, and ANSI/J-STD-001, <I>Requirements for Soldered Electrical and Electronic Assemblies</I> does not assure reliable solder connections, only quality solder connections. It is for this reason that IPC-D-279, <I>Design Guidelines for Reliable Surface Mount Technology Printed Board Assemblies</I>, is being developed. The 'Design for Reliability (DfR)' for solder attachments in electronic interconnections will be the emphasis of the paper.

<P>
Typical solder materials and solder joints, employed in fiber-optics engineering, are examined from the stand-point of the requirements for optical performance of the devices, as well as for the short- and long term mechanical reliability of the soldered optical fibers and the solder materials themselves. We address the geometry's of, and the loading condition in, fiber-optics solder joints, and suggest several analytical stress models that enable one to evaluate thermally and mechanically induced stresses in solder joint assemblies in fiber-optics structures. These models include: thermal stresses in metallized fibers soldered into ferrules or capillaries; stresses at the menisci areas in soldered joints; comparison of the thermal stresses due to the application of &quot;hard&quot; (high modulus) and &quot;soft&quot; (low modulus) solders; interaction of the &quot;global&quot; and &quot;local&quot; thermal stresses in optical fibers whose end portions are soldered into capillaries; evaluation and interaction of mechanical and thermal stresses in solder joints during proof-testing of optical fibers soldered into ferrules; and others. The merits and shortcomings of soldered assemblies in comparison with adhesively bonded structures are also briefly discussed.

<P>MICROSTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS:</B> <I>Aleksander Zubelewicz</I>, IBM Microelectronics, W-64, Bldg. 4-2, 1701 North Street, Endicott, NY 13760 
<P>
The electronic industry is changing at a rapid pace. Faster and more powerful processors and ASICs continuously replace the slower devices, while price competitiveness and time-to-market becomes the true challenge for many manufacturers. The dynamic nature of the electronic industry drives for the need of using smaller packages with higher I/O count. Recently, fine pitch, a family of BGA components, and Chip Scale Packages represent the &quot;hottest&quot; technologies allowing for high I/O density. However, the future electronics applications will require processors operating with speed of several hundred MHz, then the present packaging technology may need further modifications. Consequently, the traditional PTH interconnection technology is being replaced by Surface Mount Technology and Ball Grid Arrays. Furthermore, new interconnection materials such as lead free solders and conductive adhesives are being seriously considered as a replacement of the commonly used lead based alloys. The objective of the paper is to discuss the behavior and failure mechanisms for the interconnection materials. Obviously, solders are at the top of the list, followed by encapsulations and conductive adhesives. During manufacturing operations, solders are used in the form of a paste, and when reflowed becomes ductile polycrystalline materials. These pastes must maintain appropriate rheological characteristics. It will be shown that a typical paste (solder or conductive adhesive) exhibits three stages of behavior: paste as a viscous solid, paste as a viscous fluid, and the transition stage between solid and fluid. Solder joints (after reflow) are thought to carry input/output electrical functions of the assembly as well as are designed to provide a mechanical support for the package or chip. Solders exhibit very complex microstructural behavior. There is a need for material model of solders, a model that can be used in the form of constitutive equations with built-in damage criteria, equipped with functions that represent microstructural evolution of solders, and allowing to predict the effect of strain/damage localization in solder joints. Moreover, this theory should lead to simple fatigue equations when needed. One such theory exists and will be discussed in the paper. In many cases, solder joints become the weakest link. Enhancement of the joint reliability can be accomplished by encapsulating them with polymer based materials. A microstructural numerical study for encapsulant will be briefly presented in the paper. It will be shown that fracture originates at the microscopic level of the materials, coalesce, and forms a localized fracture zone.

<P>INCONSISTENCIES IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF SOLDER JOINT RELIABILITY PHYSICS:</B> <I>Liang-chi Wen</I>, G. Mon, R. Ross, Jr., Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109
<P>
An inherent reliability problem associated with surface mount applications is that solder joints, which serve both as an electrical and a mechanical connection between part and board, are subject to thermal fatigue failure. Solder joint failure involves a complex interplay of creep and fatigue processes. Over the years, many analytical and experimental research studies have aimed to improve state-of-the-art assessment of solder joint integrity from a physics of failure perspective. Although considerable progress has been made, there still exist many inconsistent and even contradictory correlations and conclusions. This paper reviews the unique properties of near-eutectic tin-lead solder, properties such as age-softening and 'superplastic' behavior under low strain rate loading. Fundamental mechanical and thermomechanical processes are modeled to demonstrate many inconsistencies observed in the literature. These inconsistencies are to be found in both analysis and testing issues. Analytical inconsistencies arise in correlations involving Coffin-Manson and strain energy density algorithms for cycle-life prediction, the effects of mean temperature and cycle frequency, and the determination of test acceleration factors. Testing inconsistencies are to be found in the areas of mechanical versus thermal cycling, failure definations, detection methodology and treatment of failure statistics. The objective of this paper is to identify important unsettled analysis and testing issues whose resolution by the solder joint research community will assure a greater degree of solder joint reliability.

<P>AUTOMATED SOLDER LIFE ANALYSIS OF ELECTRONIC MODULES:</B> <I>Stephen A. McKeown</I>, Lockheed Martin Control Systems, 600 Main Street, Johnson City, NY 13790
<P>
The solder life analysis methods developed by Engelmaier and Steinberg have been incorporated into an automated method which combines the results of finite-element models, a component location file obtained from a computer-aided design tool, component data, and environment data to calculate the expected solder joint life for each surface mount technology component on an electronic module. The method uses the finite-element method to calculate the coefficient of thermal expansion at different locations on the surface of the module which is used in determining the thermal cycling life of the solder joints. Finite-element analysis is also used to determine the surface strains due to vibration of the module which also influences solder joint life. The component location is taken from a Mentor&#174; neutral file which also provides component description and orientation. Component data includes the dimensions of the part and information on the solder joint fillet geometry. Environment data includes temperature ranges, dwell times, vibration levels, and durations of thermal/vibration missions. This information is combined in a ANSI C-language program to determine the calculated failure rate of each component for the combined environments, and the overall computed reliability of all of the analyzed solder joints.

<P>WHEN IS A MODIFIED COFFIN-MANSON APPROACH VALID FOR SOLDER JOINT RELIABILITY PREDICTION?:</B> <I>Robert Darveaux</I>, Amkor Electronics, 1900 S. Price Road, Chandler, AZ 85248
<P>
The Coffin-Manson approach is based on relating fatigue life to plastic strain range. The basic equation has been modified by Norris-Landzberg, Engelmaier, and others to include temperature, frequency or dwell time effects. These modifications were determined empirically on specific types of soldered assemblies. Today, they are commonly applied to a wide range of assemblies and test conditions, as well as field use conditions. The main advantage of these empirical relations is that they are easy to use. They are basically back of the envelope calculations that require almost no expertise on the part of the engineer. This paper explores the validity of modified Coffin-Manson approaches as applied to solder joint reliability analysis. Several case studies are examined, and the limits of the approach are defined.

The rate of nucleation can have a strong influence on the microstructure of thin films. This talk discusses corrections to the classical expression for nucleation rate. For heterogeneous nucleation's spherical cap model a new contact-angle dependence for the prefactor is presented, while in homogeneous nucleation the self-consistency correction is reconsidered using the idea of &quot;kinetic potential.&quot; Both corrections can increase the nucleation rate significantly.

We present a study of thin film growth by thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In this investigation of metal growth onto Si substrates, the effects of chemical kinetic processes on both film structure and morphology are determined. Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to identify the nucleation sites and to monitor island growth during the submonolayer regime. Analysis of measured island size distributions reveals the importance of site-specific chemical reactions and precursor molecule diffusion. Also, we monitor the development of surface roughness of thicker films by x-ray reflectivity. These experiments demonstrate the influence of nucleation rate on surface morphology. Finally, we show how CVD kinetics can be manipulated by use of adsorbates which passivate chemically - reactive substrate sites. Adsorbate layers have been used to modify the nucleation rate and fabricate nanometer - size structures via selective - area growth.

A HRTEM study of an YBCO/Nd2CuO4/YBCO trilayered films on LaSrGaO4 substrate with PBCO as a template layer has shown that in-plane aligned a-axis oriented YBCO films may be grown on (100) LaSrGaO4 substrates by pulsed laser deposition, which contain some domains with the c-axis misaligned by 90&#176; in plane of the films. A Nd2CuO4 insulating layer, with a thickness of approximately 10nm, may be grown epitaxially between a-axis oriented YBCO layers with its c-axis parallel to the c-axis of the YBCO layers. A 90&#176;-misoriented a-axis YBCO grain in the lower YBCO layer can nucleate a 90&#176;-misoriented Nd2CuO4 grain in the a-axis oriented Nd2CuO4 layer and this grain can further nucleate a 90&#176;-misoriented YBCO grain in the top YBCO layer. Narrow vertical Nd2O3 plates were observed in 90&#176;-misoriented Nd2CuO4 grains formed epitaxially with the Nd2CuO4 grains. The interface between the PBCO template layer and the LaSrGaO4 substrate is quite rough with some amorphous islands in the template layer.

High critical temperature (high-Tc) superconductors have captured the interest of engineers and scientists world wide. For its commercial utilization in the field of microelectronics and electronic systems, they must be fabricated into desirable configurations, thin and thick films. During studies it has been observed that these superconducting thin films operating at liquid N2 temperature offer great possibilities for faster, more sensitive and precise electronics devices. Present paper reviews the fabrication techniques of high-Tc superconducting thin films which primarily includes Pulsed-Laser Deposition, Molecular ion beam epitaxy, Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) by using epitaxial growth on single crystal substrates (YSZ, MgO, Si, etc.) with excellent microstructural control and properties relationship. In addition to it, thick film fabrication is also discussed with major techniques like Screen Printing and Plasma Spraying along with associated processing parameters. Furthermore, advanced applications of each are enumerated at length.

The kinetics and temperature dependence of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"><IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/arrow-right.gif"><IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> transformation in Ti-(46-48) at.% Al alloys was studied using a novel computer-controlled temperature and electric resistivity acquisition system. Samples of the alloys were heated by controlled direct resistance heating and cooled at various rates by a helium jet quench. In situ, real time, high speed, simultaneous measurements of electrical resistivity and temperature were made during both heating and cooling. Using the resistivity and thermal arrest data, the start and finish temperatures of the various transformation modes, viz., lamellar, Widmanstatten/feathery and massive were determined as a function of cooling rate. The data obtained was correlated with light and electron microscope observations to establish transformation diagrams, and to determine the growth rate of the massive <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> phase as a function of undercooling. The experimental data was fitted into physical models and thermodynamic quantities such as the enthalpies/driving forces of formation of the massive <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> were determined. The activation enthalpy for boundary diffusion estimated from this data indicates that the massive transformation is controlled by interfacial (rather than volume) diffusion. Defect structures in the massive <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> phase and the massive <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-parent interface were characterized in detail by TEM. The implications of these studies on the mechanism of the massive transformation will be discussed.

A thermodynamic description of the Ti Al system is developed in this study. Nine phases were considered in this system. They are disordered solution phases: liquid, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">&#173;(Ti, Al), <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">&#173;(Ti, Al), (Al); ordered intermetallic phases: <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2&#173;Ti3Al, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">&#173;TiAl, TiAl3 and stoichiometric compounds: TiAl2, Ti2Al5. The Redlich Kister equation was used to describe the excess Gibbs energy for the disordered solution phases; the generalized quasi-chemical model recently developed in our research group was used to describe the ordered intermetallic phases. The parameters describing these models were obtained by optimization using the experimental phase equilibrium and thermodynamic data available in the literature. The quasi-chemical model is an extension of the Bragg Williams model similar to the extension of the regular solution model for disordered solution phases. Thermodynamic values obtained from the model parameters as well as the calculated phase diagram are in good agreement with the experimental data. The intrinsic defect concentrations calculated from the model parameters for <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">&#173;TiAl are compared with the predictions of the first principle calculation, the semi empirical relationship and the available experimental data, reasonable agreement is obtained. The model parameters for the ordered intermetallic phases can be converted to the format of sublattice model and Wagner Schottky model.

The phase relations in Ti-Al based systems are by no means well established except for the case of a few specific ternary systems. This lack of information is now being exacerbated as new generation alloys are commonly multi-component in nature. Thermodynamic phase diagram modeling for Ti-Al-X systems has been presented previously which can now form the basis for the extension of the modeling technique to multi-component alloys. Examples of calculations for a variety of multi-component alloys will be shown and the effect of light elements such as O will also be modeled. An important factor in the success of the calculation method is that the ordering of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> phase to <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">2 can now be incorporated. 1.

There has been significant interest aimed at determining the anisotropy of charge densities in the intermetallic compound TiAl. Such determinations require the accurate measurement of low order structure factors, which in turn requires an accurate knowledge of the Debye-Waller factors of the given alloy/compound. Hence, the quest for assessments of charge densities in TiAl has involved determinations of the Debye-Waller factors and structure factors. The first of these are conveniently extracted from single crystal x-ray diffraction experiments, and it has been found that in samples whose compositions are Al rich sub-lattice ordering occurs, such that there are unequal values of the Debye-Waller factors for the two Ti sites. The effect of this sub-lattice ordering on the determination of the Debye-Waller factors has been assessed and will be discussed. Furthermore, the effect of compositional uncertainties on the determination of both Debye-Waller factors and structure factors has been investigated. It has been shown that sample compositions must be known to within &#177;0.15at.% for accurate determination of charge densities. These limitations will be discussed, and an experimental approach to overcome these will be detailed.

<P>GRAIN REFINEMENT AND LAMELLAR FORMATION IN HOT-WORKED Ti-(42-47)Al-(0-0.5)B ALLOYS:</B> <I>Y-W. Kim</I>, UES, Inc., 4401 Dayton-Xenia Rd., Dayton, OH 45432
<P>
Small amounts of boron additions are known to effectively refine the alpha grains in hot worked TiAl alloys when heat treated in the alpha field, resulting in the formation of fine lamellar colony microstructures. The boron additions raise significantly the critical cooling rate above which the formation of fully lamellar structures begins to be suppressed. Since this cooling rate allows the lamellar spacing to be controllable to a greater range, it is critical to understand the formation mechanism and kinetics of gamma laths in the presence of boron (in the form of borides). For this, annealing and cooling experiments and microstructural observations have been conducted on forged alloys of Ti-(42-47)Al-(0-0.5)B. DTA measurements are underway to detect the undercoolings before gamma precipitation in the alpha matrix as a function of cooling rate. The results will be presented and analyzed to explain the role of borides on the grain refinement, the formulation of gamma precipitates, and the retardation of nonlamellar microstructure formation.

When a hexagonal close packed crystal, with ideal c/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"> ratio, is sheared by Shockley dislocations on alternate basal planes the resulting crystal is face centered cubic. The six Shockley vectors generate cubic structures in two orientations which are twins of each other. When the DO19 structure is sheared by the same six Shockley vectors the result is three different 12H structures and their three twins. These 12H structures are composed of tetragonal unit cell building blocks, having axial ratios 1:1:/2. In this description, all of the {100} planes have alternate compositions Ti, TiAl and the unique c axes are in six different directions, one resulting from each of the six Shockley shears. The 'tetragonal' description of the structures is the same as the tetragonal structure L10 except that in L10 the {100} planes have alternate compositions Ti, Al. Thus, shearing the DO19 structure in one of the Shockley directions by 1/2:/2 creates a crystal structure which is as close to L10 as the composition allows. The six variants of gamma may therefore be formed from a single crystal of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 by the operation of dislocations with the six available Shockley Burgers vectors so long as the composition may be corrected by diffusion.

Numerous theoretical, first principle calculations studies have shown that the interatomic bonding in TiAl is a mixture of covalent and metallic. There is a need to complement these studies with experimental observations. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) is capable of providing electronic structure information through the near edge fine structure in core loss peaks, since these reflect the combined effects of bonding parameters such as charge transfer, hybridization, and variation of the crystal and ligand field. In this paper, EELS has been used to study the electronic structure of stable and metastable forms of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl. The near-edge EELS signatures of the equilibrium phases at Ti-25at.%Al, Ti-75at.%Al and Ti-52at.%Al have been used to assess the suitability of this experimental method for the study of the electronic structure in <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl compounds. Metastable phases of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-Ti-50at.%Al and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2-Ti-48at.%Al have been generated by very rapid quenching from the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">-phase field, and thin amorphous films of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">-Ti-48at.%Al have been deposited by magnetron sputtering. The near edge structure of these phases have been studied using a field emission TEM equipped with an imaging parallel EELS. Furthermore, results for <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2-Ti-36at.%Al and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-Ti-52at.%Al in binary lamellar TiAl are presented. The results of this study are discussed with a view to the mechanical behavior and the phase stability of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl based compounds.

<P>
The standard free energy of formation of the oxides of the ferrous metals is generally more negative than that for the chlorides whilst the reverse is true for the equivalent compounds of the non-ferrous metals. As a source of chlorinating agent PVC has been used. PVC has the nominal formula C2H2HCI. On combustion in air, considerable heat is generated and hydrogen chloride, water vapor and carbon dioxide are evolved. It can be regarded as a free source of heat and a chlorinating agent if scrap PVC is used. In this work, this gas has successfully been used to separate zinc, lead and copper from residues such as Jarosite, EAF dust and waste materials containing copper. Dioxins were not detected either in the residues or the condensed chlorides.

Asbestos industry produces large amounts of serpentine (magnesium silicate) tailings. The effect of this on human health is well-known. Besides this, the processing of a Brazilian rock known as &quot;Pedra sab&atilde;o&quot; (soap stone) generates powders that are discharged in the environment. This material is also a potential resource of magnesium. Magnesium oxide is used in many industries like refractory, waste water treatment, among others.

A small-scale recycling unit for used beverage cans is designed, constructed and tested. The unit consists of a rotary kiln for delacquering, a gas-fired furnace crucible for melting, a baghouse for pollution control and an air recirculating system for heat recovery and oxygen control. The delacquering kiln utilizes a counter flow thermal decoating process and the optimized operating condition was found to be at 1000&#176;F, 6-7% O2 and a residence time of 15 minutes. In melting, a special salt mixture is made by combining cryolite and sodium chloride. The salt mixture has a low melting temperature (&lt;1250&#176;F) and is effective for demagging and degassing. The yield of the small-scale unit is about 90% and the energy efficiency matches those reported for large-scale facilities.

<P>MINE GEOLOGY AND PROCESS ORE CONTROL AT NEWMONT MINES, CARLIN, NV:</B> <I>Joseph C. Rota</I>, Newmont Exploration Ltd., 1700 Lincoln Street, Denver, CO 80203
<P>
The Carlin Trend, located in NE Nevada, has produced over 17 million ounces of gold from Newmont's open pit and underground operations since 1965. Oxidized portions of sediment-hosted disseminated submicron-sized native gold is mostly amenable to dump or heap leaching, yielding 50 to 70% recovery of contained gold. Metallurgical control and grade of heap leach ores are maintained by geological techniques and standard assays. Mine geologists provide field observation and mineralogic data by daily visual blasthole logging. Refractory components are separated from oxide to ensure high recovery. Geologic and assay data are combined to create mine polygons in an engineering computer database. Mining selectivity is thus enhanced by ore control geologists who make production decisions based on direct mineralogic observations at active mine faces.

<P>
The term <I>oxide gold </I>deposits, refers to gold-bearing veins, faults, and shear zones that typically contain appreciable amounts of oxidized ore or gossanous material, resulting from oxidation of sulfides. The concept of <I>oxide</I> <I>gold </I>deposits underwent a dramatic change after the discovery of the Carlin gold mine in north central Nevada in early 196O's, and now implies large tonnage, low-grade bulk minable deposits that are processed by milling and/or heap leach methods. <I>Oxide gold </I>deposits may be classified into two types: (1)<B> primary oxide</B> ores derived directly from the effects of hydrothermal alteration on oxidized host rocks, and (2) <B>secondary oxide</B> ores derived from the epigenetic effects of circulating post mineral fluids oxidizing gold-bearing sulfides. Each type of oxide gold deposit has unique diagnostic mineralogic and metallurgical characteristics, that must be addressed in order to achieve a successful exploration strategy.

Blue Star subdistrict open-pit gold deposits include multiple mines with 1.194 million ounces reserve and past production totalling 3.144 million ounces. The deposits are characterized by zoned alteration, including: 1) silicified core with erratic gold grade; 2) adjacent mill-grade (&gt;0.04 oz/st) intense quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration; 3) enveloping heap-leach grades (0.006-0.04 oz/st) weaker sericite-kaolinite-quartz-pyrite alteration; 4) surrounding decarbonatized and intensely argillized waste and leach grade ore; 5) pervasively decarbonated waste; and 6) peripheral waste with local propylitic and weaker decarbonated alteration. Each alteration assemblage is characterized by distinct rock strength parameters that influences geotechnical pit slope design, as well as metallurgy and optimizing of drill/blast cycles. Alteration of barren assemblages extend hundreds of feet beyond orebodies.

GEOLOGY AND MINERALOGY RELATED TO HEAP LEACHING AT THE RAIN MINE, ELKO COUNTY, NV: </B><I>Dean G. Heite</I>, Newmont Exploration Ltd., Carlin NV 89822
<P>
Gold Mineralization at Rain is largely hosted by Mississippian Webb Formation consisting of interbedded siltstones and mudstones. The NW-striking SE-dipping Rain fault is a main feeder structure for the deposit. Five ore types based on XRD and visual rock chip logging were identified: <B>argillaceous</B> (&gt;30% clays); <B>siliceous </B>(&lt;20% barite; <B>siliceous-baritic </B>(20-40% barite); <B>baritic </B>(&gt;40% barite); and <B>calcareous </B>(major carbonate minerals). The Rain heap-leach pad was commissioned in 1988, and to date 10.3 million tons of ore averaging 0.023 oz/st have been treated. Recovery to date through December 95 is approximately 56% for a total 132,453 ounces of gold produced. Two major factors have contributed to low leach recoveries at Rain: 1) excess <B>argillaceous ore</B> than expected on the pad, mostly late in the mine life, and 2) about half of the heaps were run-of-mine ore with no agglomeration. Testwork on leach grade composites indicated recoveries near 69% for material crushed to minus 1 1/5&quot;.

<P>
The Tusc gold deposit, located 8 miles NW of Carlin, Nevada, along the Carlin trend, is one of several structurally controlled gold deposits associated with the Good Hope fault within the Maggie Creek Subdistrict. Mining commenced in 1994 with an oxide reserve of 780,000 ounces of gold averaging 0.039 opt Au. The Good Hope Fault forms the SW edge of the Schroeder Mountain uplift (Carlin Window) and juxtaposes carbonate rocks of the Roberts Mountains Formation against siliceous mudstone, chert and siltstone of the Rodeo Creek Unit. Submicroscopic gold is disseminated in the shear zones of the Good Hope fault system and in crosscutting northeast-striking, high-angle faults in the lower plate carbonates in the immediate hanging wall. Wallrock alteration includes argillization, decalcification, silicification, and alunite veining, supergene leaching and oxidation. Arsenic forms a strong halo around the ore and an antimony anomaly occurs in the upper part of the deposit.

<P>
The McCoy/Cove mine, located in Eureka-Battle Mountain trend of Nevada, is a gold and silver deposit. Case studies of recoverable reserve estimation for gold and silver were made using multiple indicator kriging and volume variance correction. The grade tonnage distributions of recoverable reserves were constructed and compared with the distributions defined by blast hole assays. Optimal pits were generated by Whittle 4D pit optimization package to analyze the impact of different processing recoveries at different economic cutoffs. The results were compared with ordinary kriging. The study indicates that the proposed method for multi-mineral recoverable reserve estimation is more accurate than kriging in terms of grade and tonnage. The method of using recoverable reserves for pit optimization will maximize global reserve recovery and revenue, and is more efficient than condition simulation regarding computing power.

Intermagnetics has concentrated on manufacturing long lengths of silver sheathed Bi-2223 and surface coated Bi-2212 HTS conductor. Development work has led to the successful manufacture of Bi-2223 multifilament conductor in lengths exceeding 1 km, with properties useful for most electric power applications. Surface coated, low cost, Bi-2212 conductor in lengths over 400 meters are now also being produced. Several lengths of high performance tapes have already been delivered to GE to wind the first HTS generator coil. The coils were successfully tested in a steady state, conduction cooled environment generating 40,000 amp-turns at 23.5 K. Novel and unique hybrid magnet designs are being designed and built with the availability of both Bi-2212 and Bi-2223 HTS conductors. The demonstration and test of a pre-prototype 1 MVA transformer utilizing HTS windings is planned in collaboration with ORNL, Waukesha Electric, and RG&amp;E. The development of the largest HTS coils is continuing, for the construction of a 15 KV fault current limiter as part of the DOE-SPI program with Lockheed Martin, Southern California Edison, and LANL.

Texture was studied using image analysis software on scanned SEM images. It was found that tapes with low lead content (0.20 and 0.25) showed incomplete conversion to Bi-2223, had small grain size, and poor c-axis texture. Tapes having higher lead content (0.4 and 0.5) also showed incomplete conversion and the presence of lead-rich secondary phases. Tapes with lead contents of 0.30 and 0.35 showed complete conversion to Bi-2223, had the least amount of secondary phases, showed best c-axis texture, and had the highest Jc. The carbon content of the precursor powder also had a strong influence on secondary phase chemistry.

The effects of the particle size of precursor powder on the microstructure and Jc of Ag-sheathed Bi-2223 tapes were investigated. The calcined powder with overall composition of Bi1.89Pb0.41Sr2.01Ca2.23Oy was milled for various times using planetary ball mill. The transport property of the tapes was found to depend strongly on the particle size of the precursor powder. Enhanced reactivity of the milled powder facilitated the formation of 2223 phase and resulted in an increase of Jc. Excessive milling, however, led to the amorphisation of the powder and degraded the electrical property of the tapes.

<P>
The powder-in-tube (PIT) process has been widely used to fabricate long lengths of superconducting wires and tapes. However, problems associated with irregularly shaped cross sections resulting from the metalworking process have been identified and need to be addressed. In this investigation, Ag-clad Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 superconductors were formed by using different wire drawing and tape rolling practices. The effects of annealing and drawing direction on geometric characteristics of the round wires were determined. Also, the impact of reduction in thickness per pass and roll configuration on the properties of the tapes was investigated. The study shows that geometrical uniformity and core dimensional stability are strongly influenced by the rolling parameters chosen. A combination of small roll diameter and small reduction per pass reduces dimensional variations. This practice also leads to higher critical current densities at cryogenic temperatures in the resulting superconducting tapes. Recommendations for optimum fabrication schemes for wires and tapes are presented.

<P>A tubular architecture provides many potential attributes when applied to 
bulk superconductor structures. These include enhanced structural stability 
compared to wires and tapes, and isotropic field dependence transverse to 
the conductor&iacute;s long axis. At the same time, virtues associated with

with basal-plane texture. In this study, candidate deformation processing 
routes for tubular composite conductors were investigated in order to determine 
their potential to produce desired structures and properties. These processes 
included tube drawing, tube ironing, and hydrostatic extrusion. For tube 
drawing and ironing, an HTSC precursor form was isostatically pressed over 
a mandrel, while the hydrostatic extrusion billet was manually loaded

geometric uniformity, density, texture, and transport properties. An analysis of 
the relative stress states encountered during tube processing compared with

<P>MECHANICAL DEFORMATION AND INHOMOGENEITY OF BiSrCaCuO/Ag COMPOSITES:</B> <I>Z. Han</I> and T. Freltoft, NKT Research Center A/S, Sognevej 11, DK-2605, Br&oslash;ndby, Denmark
<P>
The mechanical deformation of BiSrCaCuO/Ag composites is generally an inhomogeneous process. Inadequate control of the deformation process results in sausaging and cracking, degrading the superconducting properties of the composite and reducing its mechanical strength. In this paper, we will apply our model of &quot;powder flow&quot; to describe the mechanical deformation process of BiSrCaCuO/Ag composites wires and tapes. Furthermore, results from experiments using a new deformation method &quot;semi-continuous pressing&quot; will be presented. By this method, it is possible to produce superconducting tapes with better homogeneity than obtained by conventional rolling. The influence of mechanical deformation on the strength of the tape, especially the bending strength, will also be discussed.

Recent activity of high temperature superconductors and its application at Toshiba will be presented. We have been developing high tensile strength conductor using AgMg(Ni) sheath material. Short samples exhibited 200 MPa of 0.2% yield strength which was 4 times to 10 times higher than that of the conventional Ag-sheathed conductor and also higher than the Nb8Sn conductor. Recently the high tensile strength conductor 100 m long was successfully fabricated and wound for the energizing test at 21 Tesla back up filed. The coil was successfully excited without any degradation. We have been also studying the effect of sausaging on critical current density. The sausaging started to occur clearly when the Vickers hardness of the oxide core was higher than that of Ag sheath. This implies that the harder sheath materials such as AgMg sheath may suppress the sausaging and improve critical current density.

We have resolved the issue of current distribution inside Ag-clad (Bi,Pb)2Sr2Ca2Cu3Oy (Bi-2223) superconductor tapes by showing that the region of high critical current density (Jc) is next to the Ag sheath. In this talk, we report a Jc value &gt;105 A/cm2 at 77 K in a self-field in Bi-2223 tapes made by the Ag-wire-in-tube method, in which a silver wire was introduced into the Ag tube. The Ag wire extended along the entire length of the tape. At 77 K and in self-field, a maximum Jc of 2 x 105 A/cm2 (critical current, Ic, = 22 A) was measured after three pressing cycles. Recently, we analyzed the transport current properties of Ag-clad Bi-2223 tapes as a function of cooling rate. A comparison between furnace-cooled and slow-cooled tapes showed that the slow-cooled tapes reached Ic values two or three times higher than those of the furnace-cooled tapes. Based on our observations, a cooling schedule that includes several intermediate cooling steps is suggested and will be discussed in this talk.

<P>
Our long-term joint project covers both the development of HTS conductors and the realization of junction models demonstrating the feasibility of future prototypes. Multifilament 2223 BPSCCO tapes are reproducibly produced having jc-s up to 30 kA/cm2 for short samples and jc <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gtequalto.gif">20 kA/cm2 for lengths <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gtequalto.gif">110 m. In a first step two layer 10 m cable dfunction model was machine wound, which showed a current capacity of 1100 A. No degradation was found under bending tests down to bending radii of 1 m. The switching elements for resistive fault current limiters consist of ceramic plates with meander shaped YBCO coatings. Two ways are investigated: both polycrystalline YSZ substrates coated by biaxially in plane oriented IBAD YSZ buffer layers (pc) and single crystal sapphire substrates (sc). 10x10 cm2 pc switching elements have been produced up to a switching power of 1500 VA (jc=60 kA/cm2). Improvements of the large scale IBAD-deposition raised jc above 105 A/cm2, small samples (1x1 cm2) attained jc=1 MA/cm2, 10x10 cm2 pc- or alternatively &oslash; sc switching elements are the basis of the proposed 100 kVA function model.

Fully lamellar with fine (150 m) and coarse (500 m) prior B grain sizes as well as duplex structures with <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">p volume fractions of 20 and 60% (15 m <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">p size) were prepared in TIMETAL 1100 by thermomechanical processing. Tensile behavior and HCF properties at R=-1 and R=0.1 were evaluated at ambient and elevated (600&#176;C) were performed at nominal stresses of 210 and 300 MPa. The fine grained fully lamellar microstructure combines the advantages of the B annealed structures (excellent creep resistance) and duplex structures (high tensile ductility) without suffering from the disadvantages of the duplex structures, i.e., anomalous mean stress sensitivity of the fatigue strength and poor creep strength. Both properties are related to the presence of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">p phase. The fatigue and creep results on the various microstructures will be interpreted in terms of phase morphologies, crystallographic textures and particular deformation mechanisms.

The creep behavior of a high temperature near <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"> alloy Ti 6242 Si has been investigated in the stress range from 160 to 350 MPa and a temperature range from 500 to 600&#176;C, using constant stress tensile creep experiments. Emphasis has been put on primary and anelastic creep behavior and their dependencies on stress, strain and processes microstructures. It is shown that both primary and anelastic creep strongly depend on creep strain and applied stress. Increasing stress and/or strain results in higher primary and anelastic creep strains. Furthermore, &szlig;-heat treated specimens with a fully transformed &szlig;-microstructure show reduced amounts of primary and anelastic creep strains, in comparison to <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">+&szlig; heat treated specimens with globular <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">-grains and variable amounts of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">+&szlig; mixture. The results obtained show also very similar kinetics of primary creep build up and strain recovery and suggest similar deformation mechanisms. Based on TEM investigations of dislocation structures of crept specimens, the results are discussed with respect to different mechanisms of dislocation motion under the effect of internal stress.

<P>
Normal liquid to solid partitioning of Cr during ingot solidification for the Ti-17 alloy can result in the formation of a segregation anomaly called &szlig; flecks. These &szlig; flecks can exhibit a significantly lower &szlig; transus than the alloy; they may also present mechanical property issues. While the major thrust toward minimizing &szlig; flecks is through melt process control, this paper addresses the capability of reducing the extent of Cr segregation using a high temperature &szlig; field homogenization heat treatment. The interdiffusion coefficients for Cr in &szlig; phase Ti-17 were determined and used in diffusion equations to calculate the rate of dissipation of the segregated regions. Correlation is shown for the calculated, and critical experiment demonstrated, increase in the &szlig; fleck &szlig; transus temperature with the time and temperature of these homogenization heat treatments.

<P>
Biaxial creep behavior of thin-walled tubing of cold-worked stress-relieved cp-titanium alloy was investigated using internal pressurization superimposed with axial load at ??? K. Creep anisotropy was characterized in terms of a creep locus at a constant energy dissipation with power-law dependencies of the component (hoop and axial) strain-rates under varied stress ratios. The experimental results were fit to the modified Hill's equation with anisotropy parameters, R and P which are also the contractile strain (rate) ratios. The crystallographic texture of the tubing was characterized through inverse and direct pole figures from which the <U>c</U>rystallite <U>o</U>rientation <U>d</U>istribution <U>f</U>unctions (CODF) were derived. The CODF was combined with plasticity model based on power-law stress dependence of the strain-rate and dominance of basal prism and pyramidal slip systems were considered. In contrast to the recrystallized materials, experimental results deviated from the prism-model predictions albeit the deformed microstructures revealed only prism dislocations. These differences are attributed to the grain-shape anisotropy due to cold-work. Quantitative analyses of the superimposed effects of grain shape anisotropy due to cold-work. Quantitative analyses of the superimposed effects of grain shape anisotropy on grain orientation anisotropy (texture) are underway and the results to-date will be presented.

The microstructural development of Ti-6Al-2Mo-2Cr-2Sn-2Zr-0.2Si(Ti-6-22-22S) alloy after various heat treatments has been examined by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), conventional transmission electron microscopy (CTEM) and high resolution electron microscopy (HREM), coupled with high spatial resolution microanalysis.

<P>
The fatigue crack propagation behavior of the high-temperature Ti-alloy IMI 834 was investigated at a test temperature of 500&#176;C under different environmental conditions: vacuum, laboratory air, and Ar=50% relative humidity. Two different microstructures were compared, a pure lamellar and a bi-modal structure, consisting of 20% equiaxed primary a phase in a lamellar matrix. Crack propagation tests were carried out on CT-specimens under constant amplitude sinusoidal loading conditions with a frequency of 30 Hz at R=0.1 and R=0.6. The results showed for example, that at R=0.6 fatigue crack propagation for both microstructures occurred at much lower near threshold <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-delta.gif">K- values (4 MPa-m1/2) in the two aggressive environments (air, humid Ar) as compared to those measured in vacuum (10 MPa-m1/2). Furthermore, in an intermediate <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-delta.gif">K-regime (6 to 12 MPa-m1/2) the da/dN-K curves in the aggressive environments exhibited a plateau region with a nearly constant crack propagation rate of about 5x10-8m/cycle. At high growth rates these curves approached those measured in vacuum. The results will be discussed on the basis of fracture surface studies (e.g. cleavage-like features found in the aggressive environments in comparison to a ductile fracture mode in vacuum), through thickness crack front profile analysis, and crack closure measurements.

<P>
Following the discovery of improved oxidation resistance of Ti-Al-based alloys containing second phase precipitates of Al-rich Ti(Cr,Al)2, a similar approach was suggested for the o-phase. A schematic representation of the Ti-Al-Cr-Nb quaternary system was constructed at 800&#176;C. Subsequently, five alloys, based on the Ti-Al-Cr-Nb quaternary system were prepared in order to probe the phase equilibria between the corresponding Ti2AlX compositions of the Ti-Al-Nb and Ti-Al-Cr ternary systems. The samples were homogenized above the beta-transus then heat treated at 800&#176;C. The resulting phase equilibria and microstructure were evaluated. Additionally, cyclic oxidation studies, at 800 and 900&#176;C were conducted on the heat treated samples to assess their oxidation resistance. Similar behavior for the alloys was observed at 800&#176;C, however, at 900&#176;C the Cr rich alloys experienced significant spalling.

The oxidation behavior of ternary Ti3Al-Nb alloy has been studied in pure oxygen over the temperature range of 750&#176;C to 1100&#176;C. The experiments were carried out using TGA. The oxidation products were analyzed using X-ray diffraction, SEM and EDS. Parabolic rate constants were calculated. An effective activation energy of 268 KJ/mol was deduced. The oxidation products formed are non-continuous protective scale on Ti3Al-Nb alloys. The results showed that oxidation products were mainly a mixture of TiO2 (rutile) and Al2O3 (alumina). For oxidation scale at 1100&#176;C, it exhibited a layered scale of alternate rutile and alumina. The present results were also compared with that of binary Ti3Al.

The science and technology of powder injection has evolved from its start in the desulphurization of iron over 20 years ago. The inherent advantages of powder injection are: rapid reaction rate, good mixing, the ability to handle fine materials, flexibility and low capital cost. The fundamental engineering science related to the fluid mechanics of injection, and the associated thermodynamics and kinetics of the processes will be reviewed. Due to the above advantages, this technology is finding application in the recycling of in-plant dusts and other secondary materials, and in the non-ferrous industry. Some of these developments will be highlighted.

Flash converting of MK concentrate (Cu2S) was considered as an option for the process flowsheet modifications at Inco's Copper Cliff operations. The flash converting of chalcocite was known to have problems, such as the generation of large amounts of dust, so a comprehensive research program was undertaken at the Centre for Metallurgical Process Engineering, University of British Columbia to examine the process. This paper is a compilation of the results of the project, some of which have been published elsewhere. The mechanism and kinetics of the combustion of individual particles of MK were determined, and dust generation criteria were established. The flash converting flame was mathematically simulated, and dust generation regions within the flame were identified. Pilot plant trials were conducted, confirming that the dust generation rate could be affected (reduced) by altering the burner configuration, and thus the flame characteristics.

<P>
Pneumatic injection of various fine materials such as metallic concentrates, fluxes and fuels into pyrometallurgical vessels has become an important practice. Injection is an evolutionary step from pneumatic conveying - the receiving vessel is now a metallurgical process unit instead of a storage unit. Proper injection system design must integrate conveying, injection, metallurgical process and physical constraints, as well as the limitations of specific material characteristics. Dilute phase pneumatic conveying requires large quantities of conveying gas in order to move material. Load ratios in the order of 10:1 (weight of solid gas:weight of conveying gas) are typical. In order to eliminate the problems associated with dilute phase (including extreme pipeline and component abrasion, excess conveying gas, etc.) steady development has been made in the application of dense phase (load ratios substantially higher than 25:1) pneumatic conveying and injection technology. Load ratio selection is dependent upon many factors including specific material characteristics and system requirements. This paper will outline the advantages of dense phase pneumatic injection technology and will present successful and reliable pyrometallurgical applications.

<P>COAL PARTICLE INJECTION AND DEVOLATILISATION UNDER RAPID HEATING CONDITIONS: </B>J. Beeson, <I>V. Sahajwalla</I>, G. Belton, School of Materials Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; BHP Research, Newcastle Laboratories, Newcastle, Australia
<P>
New developments in the metallurgical industry, such as iron bath smelting processes and pulverised coal injection into blast furnaces involve coal injection and devolatilisation under rapid heating conditions. These new technologies employ coal particle heating rates around 104&#176;C/sec. Under these conditions the volatile matter released cannot be established from standard analysis and this can have a significant effect on the process. For example the volatile matter released, which is in excess of that from standard analysis, may lead to excess gas in the top space of a bath smelter. When the efficiency of the reactor relies on a fine balance of post combustion reactions, the increase in release of volatile matter may lead to a decrease in the efficiency of the reactor. In pulverised coal injection to blast furnaces, the amount of volatiles released, and the time taken for this release, influences the combustion behaviour of the coal and char. In this study, the injection and devolatilisation of three size fractions of various coals into a drop tube furnace was investigated. The surface mean diameters of each size fraction were 92&#181;m, 121&#181;m, and 172&#181;m. Four coal types were investigated, sub-bituminous, bituminous, semi-anthracite and an anthracite. These were injected at temperatures of 1000&#176;C, 1200&#176;C, and 1400&#176;C. The ash content and volatile matter remaining in each of the chars was determined in order to calculate the volatile yield using the ash tracer method and the rate of volatiles release. An apparent activation energy for the release of volatiles was calculated. The results show a strong dependence of the activation energy for volatile release on coal crystallite size, as determined by X-ray diffraction. Hence the crystallite size could be an important characteristic of coals that is significant for coal selection for the new technologies in the metallurgical industry.

<P>
The Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) technique was used to measure the instantaneous velocity distribution of polyvinyl chloride particles suspended in an upright cylindrical water bath (0.218 m diameter) agitated by injection of air through a top-submerged centric lance. The time-averaged particle velocity and kinetic energy distributions were obtained from the instantaneous velocity data. The effects of gas flowrate (3.3 10-5 - 5 10-5 Nm3/s), liquid depth (0.164-0.196 m), fractional lance submergence (60-90%), and particle diameter (50-80 &#181;m) were investigated. The magnitudes of the particle velocities and kinetic energies increased with increasing gas injection rate, and increasing lance submergence. Variation of the liquid depth had minimal influence on the particle behaviour under the conditions studied. Steady state liquid phase flowfield simulations using a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics package were combined with a dynamic force balance on individual suspended particles to predict the time-averaged particle velocities. Satisfactory agreement was found between the predicted and measured particle velocities, outside the bubble plume region. The particle velocities were integrated with time to predict the trajectories and residence times of particles introduced into the flowfield at different positions. Particles introduced near the plume region were predicted to have much shorter residence times than particles released near the primary recirculation vortex.

<P>RHENIUM SEVENTY YEARS OLD:</B> <I>Fathi Habashi</I>, Department of Mining and Metallurgy, Laval University, Quebec City, Canada, GIK 7P4
<P>
Rhenium was discovered in Berlin in 1925 by Ida Tacke, Walter Noddack, and Otto Berg. It was isolated in milligram amounts by Ida Noddack (born Tacke) in 1926. The first 100 kg of the metal were produced seventy years ago from carbonaceous copper shist ore (Kupferschiefer) from the Mansfeld District in Germany. The process was so complicated and the price so high that production was discontinued until early 1950 when tungstenrhenium and molybdenumrhenium alloys were prepared. These alloys found important applications in industry that resulted in a great demand for the metal produced from the molybdenite fraction of porphyry copper ores. The early story of rhenium will be told from personal interviews with Ida Noddack (18961978).

<P>RHENIUM BACKGROUND AND MARKETS:</B> Tom A. Millensifer, Powmet, Inc., 2625 Sewell St., P.O. Box 5086, Rockford, IL 61125
<P>
Rhenium existed as a curiosity with little practical application for it's first nearly 50 years. Use was limited to a few specialty and high temperature alloy applications. In the early 1960's interest in the potential for catalytic use of Rhenium developed and by the early 1970's significant catalytic use had begun. Greater production was required. Leading development of production technology in the Western World was Kennecott Copper Corporation which originated industrial scale recovery techniques. In 1963 Shattuck Chemical in Denver, Colorado installed recovery facilities based on Kennecott's technology. The facilities were followed by recovery at Starck in Germany and Molycorp in Chili. In 1980 Duval Corporation, a subsidiary of Pennzoil, installed recovery facilities and began recovery in mid 1981. Today recovery from Molybdenite exists in the Western World in only three places with one other available but not operating at this time.

<P>MILL PRODUCTS AND FABRICATED COMPONENTS IN RHENIUM METAL AND RHENIUM RICH ALLOYS:</B> Jan-C. Carl&eacute;n, Rhenium Alloys, Inc., P.O. Box 245, Elyria, OH 44036
<P>
For a metal which is produced in quantities around 50 tons per year worldwide, it should be difficult to talk about bulk usage. However, about 90% of the rhenium produced is used for catalysts and as an alloying element in nickelcobaltbase superalloys. This paper deals with mill products based on powder metallurgy production of rhenium and molybdenumrhenium and tungstenrhenium alloys. Rhenium is a metal which workhardens very quickly in coldworking and which cannot be hotworked because of hotshortness and poor oxidation resistance. This makes plastic forming of rhenium a very delicate process. Rhenium cannot be machined using conventional methods but other means of making complicated shapes have been developed. Alloys between rhenium and tungsten and rhenium and molybdenum have their best properties at or close to the solubility limit for rhenium in each metal, which may create problems with formation of a brittle, intermetallic phase (sigma phase). However, these alloys are much easier to form using plastic hot and cold forming. They can also be formed into various shapes using regular machining methods. Means of avoiding or eliminating the negative effect of sigma phase are briefly discussed. Finally the industrial usage of mill products and assintered products of rhenium and its alloys with molybdenum and tungsten is discussed. These materials have found many challenging applications in space, defense, electronic, energy, scientific instruments and other hightech industries.

<P>THE PERSPECTIVES FOR DEVELOPMENT OF RHENIUM PRODUCTION IN RUSSIA:</B> Albert D. Besser, A.V. Peredereev, State Research Center of Russia, 13 Acad. Korolyov Street, 129515 Moscow, Russia
<P>
The rhenium's production base in Russia is based on the processing of the concentrates of the effective tungsten-molybdenum mines (Zhirkenskyi, Sorskyi, Tyrnyauzskyi) and opening up of the new ones (Bugdainskyi, Aksukskyi and others), as well as on the recovery of rhenium from the gases during the burning of the shales. The substantial content of rhenium and of some other rare components in the volcanic slags has been revealed. The extraction technology has been developed. The processing technology of the secondary rhenium-containing raw materials and of the intermediate products has been developed and realized in the industrial conditions. The technologies concerning the extraction of more than 90% of rhenium from the molybdenite concentrates following the pyro- and hydrometallurgical processes have been developed and are ready now for the industrial realization.

<P>ELECTRODE POTENTIAL DEPENDENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CRACKING IN HIGH STRENGTH 7XXX ALUMINUM ALLOYS: </B>L.M. Young, R.P. Gangloff, Department of Materials Science and Engineering University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903
<P>
This research aims to determine the effect of electrode potential on the kinetics of environmental crack growth in precipitation hardened 7XXX aluminum alloys. High resolution compliance and electric potential measurements of da/dt provide part of the foundation to understand the mechanisms for the agingmicrostructure dependence of shorttransverse cracking. Measured Stage II growth rates in AA7075T651, immersed in aqueous chloride, are slow and depend on electrode potential and inhibitor addition. For cracking in a molybdatechloride solution, da/dt rises from 107 mm/s at 900 mVSCE (nearopen circuit) to 105 mm/s at 750 mVSCE, but is constant or declines with more noble applied polarization. The crack path is along or near highangle boundaries, but the crystallographic and microstructure details are undefined. These results are consistent with literature findings for AA7075T6 in KI solution. The potential for the maximum in da/dt is more noble for the iodide compared to the molybdate, and is most active for cracking in bare chloride solution. This transition potential is governed by the onset of substantial localized crack tip dissolution which causes an IR difference that shields the crack from changes in anodic polarization. The importance of this potential dependence is illustrated by results for AA 7050T6 in molybdate. Crack growth is faster compared to the AA7075 case if both alloys are at their open circuit potential. Crack growth in AA7050 is slower than that in AA7075 if the comparison is made at a fixed electrode potential.

<P>
The inelastic deformation behavior of 5083 A1 alloy has been studied to clarify the effects of grain size and temperature by conducting a series of load relaxation tests. The experimental results were then analyzed based on the recently proposed internal variable theory of inelastic deformation. The inelastic deformation of fine grained 5083 Al alloy at high temperatures is confirmed to consist of grain boundary sliding and accommodating grain matrix deformation caused by dislocation glide processes. A HallPetch type relation is found to exist between the grain size and an internal strength variable, instead of the generally used flow stress.

Investigators need a consistent and accurate method to measure and report sample warpage to assess material distortion during heat treatment. Consistent and accurate sample surface profile measurement can commence only after the sample is precisely positioned. This paper proposes using a positioning fixture which exactly constrains a sample's six degrees of freedom. Mounted in this fixture, standard dimensional inspection tools such as level gauges and dial indicator are then used to measure profiles along predetermined sample surface zones. Normalizing those measurements with respect to fixture constraint points and then plotting them on a graph allow precise warpage measurement and easy distortion visualization. In this study samples of 7050 plates were machined. The samples were of 1', 1.5&quot;, and 4&quot; thickness and the crosssectional shapes were Uchannels and I beams. Samples were solution treated and one group was quenched in water and the second group in a polyalkylene-glycol solution. The effect of the sample's thickness and shape as well as the quenching medium on the warpage behavior will be discussed.

<P>
This paper presents a correlation study between microstructure and dynamic deformation behavior of AlLi alloys which have great potential for structural armor materials. The selected materials were a 2090 AlLi alloy, a Weldalite 049 alloy, and a 7039 Al alloy, to allow a comparative study of different strengths and microstructures. These alloys were deformed at a very high strain rate by ballistic impact. The amount and the distribution of adiabatic shear bands were examined after the ballistic impact testing, and the dynamic shear stressstrain curves were obtained from the dynamic torsional Kolsky bar (strain rate=i-103/sec) test in order to evaluate the possibility of forming adiabatic shear bands. In the vicinity of the perforated region, adiabatic shear bands were hardly observed in the 2090 and the Weldalite alloys, whereas they easily formed in the 7039 alloy. The overall observed phenomenology was interpreted using the dynamic shear stress strain curves, together with the strength level and microstructure. In the curves, the maximum shear stress and the shear strain at the maximum stress point were of primary importance in analyzing the adiabatic shear banding behavior, suggesting that the torsional Kolsky bar test is a good tool for evaluating the ballistic performance AlLi alloys.

COMPETITION BETWEEN METASTABLE AND STABLE PHASES DURING SOLIDIFICATION OF AlFeVSi ALLOYS:</B> Hyang Jin Koh, Woo Jin Park*, Sangho Ahn* and Nack J.

<P>
AlFeVSi alloys have been produced by strip casting and spray casting. These processes offer relatively fast solidification rates and can produce near net shape products such as thin gauge strips or billets with the fine microstructure free from segregation. It has been shown that the microstructure of the alloys consists of various phases; bcc phase, microquasicrystalline phase, icosahedral phase, and the newly found hexagonal phase. All the phases are structurally related and have close orientation relationships among them. The volume fraction and distribution of these phases depend on the solidification rate and the degree of undercooling. The degree of recalescence occurring during solidification also affects the final microstructure, in that the less thermally stable phases transform to the stable phase.

THE EFFECTS OF AGING ON THE DIFFUSION AND TRAPPING OF HYDROGEN IN AN AL6.2ZN2.3MG2.3CU ALLOY: </B>George A. Young Jr., John R. Scully, Center for Electrochemical Science &amp; Engineering, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, The University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903
<P>
Thermal desorption spectroscopy was used to investigate the diffusion and trapping of hydrogen in a Al6.2Zn2.3Mg2.3Cu alloy and in pure aluminum. Both the peak aged (T6) and overaged (T74) tempers were investigated for the alloy. Hydrogen was uniformly charged into rodshaped samples via exposure to water vapor saturated air. Isothermal desorption scans were utilized to determine the apparent activation energy for hydrogen diffusion. Constant heating rate thermal desorption scans were performed to identify hydrogen trap sites and quantify trap binding energies. In all desorption experiments, a quadrupole mass spectrometer was used to distinguish the desorption of hydrogen from that of other atomic or molecular species. Results from isothermal experiments show that bulk diffusion of hydrogen in the overaged alloy is appreciably slower than in the peak aged temper or in pure aluminum. Constant heating rate experiments reveal multiple trapping sites in both the alloy and in pure aluminum. The effects of the number and binding energy of trap sites on the diffusivity of hydrogen is quantified and the implications of these results on the hydrogen environment assisted cracking of precipitation hardened AlZnMg alloys are discussed.

<P>
The evolution of microstructures was studied in 7X50 aluminum alloys, as a function of the manufacturing variables, during laboratory and industrial processing conditions. The fracture toughness, fatigue crack initiation and fatigue crack propagation of typical microstructures was measured. Low fracture toughness values and low resistance to fatigue crack growth were observed as a result of a high degree of recrystallization and a large volume fraction of both particles and hydrogen porosity. The resistance to fatigue crack propagation was higher in microstructures consisting of deformed grains with significant substructure. The morphology of various types of particles, volume fraction of the recrystallized microstructures, the grain and subgrain morphologies were observed to influence considerably the fatigue resistance. These microstructural parameters could be controlled effectively by the amount of total strain and the strain of the final pass, and the deformation temperatures during controlled rolling and subsequent double aging during final thermomechanical processing. Relationships between microstructure/fracture toughness/fatigue resistance will be discussed.

<P>
Directionally solidified blades and vanes, so-called DS blades and vanes, have already been used in jet engines, but seldom in land-base gas turbines, because there are large differences in the size of hot parts, fuel and so on between jet engines and land-base gas turbines. It is necessary to take these differences into account when developing DS blades and vanes for land-base gas turbines. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. started to develop DS blades some years ago. First, material properties, such as, tensile strength, creep rupture, fatigue, other physical properties, etc, were investigated. Then, the optimization of casting conditions for large size blades (501FG/T 1st blade) was conducted. Finally, actual DS blades were cast and it was confirmed their material properties were excellent. Also their machinability and coating were evaluated and good results were obtained. As a result, DS blades were installed in an actual gas turbine (MF111G/T) in January 1994 which have been in operation since then.

<P>
Microstructural stability is a key parameter in the development and application of single crystal superalloys. The formation of topologically close packed (TCP) phases occurs to some degree in most single crystal superalloys. The effect of these phases on properties will be discussed. In addition, the effects of time and temperature on the formation of TCP phases will be shown for a recent single crystal superalloy, Ren&eacute; N6. Another form of microstructural instability has recently been observed in high refractory content single crystal superalloys. This instability, termed SRZ, is a cellular phase transformation that can occur either beneath coatings or in the alloy substrate. The occurrence and effects of this instability in various alloys will be discussed. The third form of microstructural instability observed in several single crystal superalloys is the conversion of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> matrix with <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1 precipitates to a microstructure with a continuous <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> phase.

<P>
Advanced single crystal (SC) nickel based superalloys have been available in small cast size for aero engine applications for a long time. Where as the SC techniques are not yet widely used in the land based engine components because of their much larger size which makes casting and the subsequent heat treatment more difficult. The difference in defects, such as microporosity, segregation, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1 eutectic, and dendritic structure, derived from casting size differences will affect the heat treatment process and the subsequent service properties, including hot corrosion/oxidation behavior. Hot corrosion tests were carried out at 900, 950, and 1000&#176;C on specimens coated with NasSO4 in air. Three different kinds of specimens; as-cast and heat treated CMSX-4 from small and large blades, and IN738, were used to study the effects of cast defects and heat treatment on hot corrosion behavior and to compare the hot corrosion resistance of the single crystal superalloy with a typical land based turbine material. The corrosion product morphology, microstructure and composition were investigated using metallography and SEM/EDS. It is concluded that although the hot corrosion resistance of this single crystal material is not as good as that of IN738, proper heat treatment can double its hot corrosion resistance.

Due to numerous property advantages, NiAl single crystal alloys are being investigated as a replacement for Ni-based single crystal superalloys in high pressure turbine engine sections, however, the current drawback is their lack of ductility. Consequently, a significant effort is being made to develop testing and design methodologies that will account for this lack of ductility. The present approach is to modify existing test methods and brittle design methodologies, such as those in the Ceramic Analysis and Reliability Evaluation of Structures (CARES) code, and to experimentally verify the results. To this end, the statistical nature and source of fracture in a high-strength, single crystal NiAl alloy has been studied via flexural testing of 3- and 4-point bend specimens of various crystallographic orientations. Flexural strength results indicate a wide dispersion in strength that can be characterized via normal or Weibull statistics. While the fracture strength was function of orientation, the Weibull modulus was not. Failure origins were determined for most of the specimens tested. In all cases, failure occurred from singular carbide particles or machining damage. It was also determined that the Weibull scaling law applies to uniaxial cases for effective surface area changes of 300% or less.

It is well known that creep-rupture strength of nickel-base superalloys strongly depends on the conditions of solution heat treatment. Jackson et al. 1 showed that creep-rupture life of MAR M 200 Hf DS in longitudinal direction increased with increasing volume fraction of fine <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1 upon solution heat treatment. On the other hand, Cetel and Duhl 2 showed that creep ductility of PWA1426 DS in transverse direction decreased with increasing volume fraction of fine <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1. In this study, in order to investigate the effect of solution heat treatment on DS transverse strength, CM186LC DS which is usually used without solution heat treatment was solution heat treated at 1548K for different time periods. Results are summarized as follows. (1) Creep-rupture strength of CM186LC DS in longitudinal direction increased by solution heat treatment. (2) Creep-rupture strength of CM186LC DS in transverse direction decreased by solution heat treatment. (3) Boron at grain boundaries diffused into grains by solution heat treatment. This phenomenon possibly caused the decrease of creep-rupture strength of CM186LC DS in transverse direction.

Modern gas turbine components must possess unique combination of various high temperature strength and corrosion resistance properties for providing increased efficiency and reliability of operation. Some of these properties, which a material must have are good isothermal and cyclic oxidation resistance, good carburization resistance, good thermal stability, good stress rupture and fatigue strength and most importantly, good fabricability and weldability. Alloy 603GT is a new cobalt free nickel base alloy especially developed for modern gas turbine components. Its basic composition of high chromium, high aluminum, high carbon (25 Cr, 2.6 Al, 0.3 C, 0.1 Y, 9 Fe, Ni balance) and micro alloying with titanium and zirconium, gives this alloy a unique combination of excellent high temperature strength and superior oxidation resistance, carburization resistance, good thermal stability, grain growth resistance and spallation resistance.

<P>
Since 1990, proposed legislation and consumption taxes on the use of lead have concerned the electronics industry in this country. Although the consumption of lead for electronic interconnections (via solder) is relatively low in comparison to batteries, the possibility of restricting lead usage for solder alloys would have a dramatic effect on the electronics industry. This concern lead the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences (NCMS), a not-for-profit cooperative research consortium of more than 215 U.S. North American manufacturers, to establish a multi-year Lead Free Solder Project, involving participants from industry, (GM DELCO, AT&amp;T/Lucent Technologies, United Technologies/Hamilton Standard, GM-Hughes, Rockwell International, Ford, Texas Instruments), academia (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), and national laboratories (Sandia, NIST, and Electronic Manufacturing Productivity Facility). The objective of the program was to identify lead free solder alternative replacement(s) for lead bearing solders in the electronics industries. The alloy(s) must meet the interconnect performance requirements at operating environments ranging from -40 to +125&#176;C. Over the past three years, numerous lead free alloy solders have been thoroughly evaluated. The project participants will be presenting the results of this four year NCMS evaluation of the material properties, economic impact, toxicological properties, manufacturability, modeling and reliability predictions.

In this presentation, the process of alloy development and down selection is summarized. An initial list of more than 70 alloys was constructed, including binary, ternary, quaternary, and quinary alloys. he first selection process was applied based on the toxicology, economic, and availability criteria. Then a downselection criteria matrix, including melting temperatures, wetting behavior, and thermo-mechanical fatigue, was generated for a quantitative comparison of alloys with respect to three baseline alloys: eutectic Sn-Pb, Sn-Bi, and Sn-Ag solders. Physical testing was performed to provide the data for downselection. Extensive phase diagrams from literature and thermodynamic calculation were used to predict the melting temperature range, and compare with experimental results. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify publications of the past 25 years.

Based on data from the U.S. Department of Interior, an economics/availability study was completed which estimates the impacts on supply and cost to the electronics industry if it were to replace tin-lead solder with a lead-free solder alloy. Considerations in this study included the availability of the replacement materials, world mine production and consumption, world reserves and reserve bases, present world mine production capacity, principal reserve locations, average annual price and price history. Seven alloying elements were investigated. They were antimony, bismuth, cadmium, copper, indium, silver, tin, and zinc. Limits placed on the estimated alloy cost, ore reserve consumption rate, and required mine or refining capacity permitted rank ordering of potential alloys. An extensive literature search on the toxicity of common solder alloying elements was also conducted. Available data on the disposition, toxicity, and exposure limits of these solder alloying elements were analyzed in order to rank their use risk. The process used to evaluate the economics, availability, and toxicity of lead free solders, as well as the findings of the study will be discussed.

<P>MANUFACTURING WITH LEAD-FREE SOLDERS:</B> <I>John Greaves</I>, Electronics Manufacturing Productivity Facility, 714 N. Senate Ave., Indianapolis, IN 46202-3112
<P> 
Successful introduction of lead-free solders into the manufacturing process requires subtle changes in process parameters. Changes in density, melting temperature, wetting and spreading behavior, all affect the parameters necessary for optimum manufacturing and reliability. This currently results in a need to change print speeds, squeegee pressures, and stencil thicknesses. Component placement is relatively unchanged. The largest changes in manufacturing with lead-free solders are those in the reflow process. Manufacturing lead-free solders with RMA fluxes requires modifying reflow profiles to insure that the flux is active when the solder reaches the melting temperature. Manufacturing with fluxes designed for lead-free solders simply requires setting the conveyor speeds and zone temperatures to achieve the suggested profile. No substantial difference has been noticed in the cleaning of lead-free alloys and the lead-free alloys evaluated are compatible with no-clean processes as well. Wave soldering of lead-free solders using RMA fluxes can present some difficulties if the process is not well controlled. While many lead-free solders can be used in wave-soldering with no changes to the profile or pot temperature, using fluxes and profiles designed for lead-free solders can increase yields and simplify the wave-soldering process.

The NCMS Lead-Free Project Modeling Task Group was formed to determine the capability of existing models developed by the consortium members to predict low cycle fatigue life for specified test vehicles using down-selected lead-free solder alloys. A quantitative summary and objective analysis of predictions and modeling capability for down-selected alloys are generated. Life prediction results are correlated with reliability test vehicle data using a -55 to +125&#176;C thermal cycle. The final project goal is a design guide for predicting joint fatigue life for lead-free leadless capacitors and resisters, 44 LCCC, 32 TSOP, and 132 PQFP components. Solder down-selection guidance is provided through recommendations of mechanical tests, test priority, and evaluation of hysteresis loop, thermo-mechanical fatigue, creep, and tensile property data. Alloy phase diagram modeling information provides manufacturing down-selection criteria. Additional support is provided through stress analysis of manufacturing test vehicles.

<P>INFLUENCE OF TEXTURE AND STRESS STATE ON THE CONSTITUTIVE RESPONSE OF AN AUTOMOTIVE STEEL:</B> <I>Carl M. Cady</I>*, Shuh-Rong Chen, George T.

<P>
The relationships between the stress state, texture, revalue (Lankford parameter), and yield surface for a DQSK mild sheet steel have been analyzed. The strain rate and temperature sensitivity of the flow stress and the insensitivity of the strain hardening rate indicate that thermal activation over a Peierls barrier is the rate controlling mechanism for deformation in DQSK. The stress/strain response for DQSK steel is shown to be strongly influenced by strain rate and temperature which is consistent with this controlling mechanism. A calculated yield surface, using the Quadratic Hill criterion, is shown to produce an accurate correlation with the experimental results. Comparisons of the stress/strain response with the calculated yield surface and texture measurements will be shown to correlate with the relationships between the inplane and through thickness deformation.

<P>THE MICROTEXTURE OF FRACTURE IN LITHIUM-CONTAINING ALUMINUM ALLOYS:</B> <I>R.

An Electron Back-Scattered Pattern (EBSP) system was used on a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to examine the crystallographic features of intergranular fracture in several lithium-containing aluminum alloys. The alloys examined have thin, flat grains with a &quot;pancake&quot; morphology, which tend to be highly elongated in the rolling direction. Metallographically prepared and electropolished samples of longitudinal sections were examined in the SEM where absorbed current images and diffraction data were collected through-thickness, with patterns indexed to the images. Delamination fracture was then induced in the samples by torsional loading, which often produced several cracks, and samples were returned to the SEM chamber to determine the crack locations relative to the previously acquired data. The results indicate that delamination occurs between grains near the S and R texture component orientations, which are known to form during deformation processing and as a result of grain boundary initiated recrystallization, respectively.

<P>ELEVATED TEMPERATURE COMPRESSIVE SLOW STRAIN RATE PROPERTIES OF SEVERAL DIRECTIONALLY SOLIDIFIED NIAL-(NB, MO) ALLOYS:</B> J. Daniel Whittenberger, Ronald D.

Three NiAl-based alloys containing 3Nb-lOMo, 5Nb-lOMo or 13.6Nb-18Mo (at. %) were directionally solidified (ds'ed) to develop interpenetrating networks of B2 crystal structure NiAl Laves NiAlNb and bcc metallic Mo. It was hoped that the Mo would improve the fracture toughness, while the Laves phase would promote good creep resistance. Examination of the alloys indicated that the as-grown structure consisted of essentially unalloyed NAL NiAlNb alloyed with ~8.5 Mo, and a Mo solid solution containing 27Nb-7Ni-7A1. Compressive properties were measured between 1200 to 1400 K in air with strain rates ranging from ~10-4 to ~10-8s-1. The flow strengths of the two alloys with 10Mo were nearly identical and much weaker than those for NAI-13.6Nb-18Mo. Comparison the properties of this latter alloy with other ds'ed NAl-based eutectics revealed that it was the strongest material under lower temperature/fast deformation conditions, but this advantage was lost at higher temperatures and/or slower strain rates.

<P>DEFORMATION AND FAILURE MECHANISMS IN MATERIALS THAT DEFORM BY TWINNING AND MARTENSITIC TRANSFORMATION:</B> Surya R. Kalidindi, R.D. Doherty, E. El-Danaf, S. Asgari, I Shaji, Department of Materials Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA 19104

MP35N (35% Co, 35% Ni, 10% Mo, 20% Cr) exhibits an remarkable combination of ultrahigh strength, high ductility, high fracture toughness, high corrosion resistance, and it retains its room temperature strength upto about 600&#176;C. This alloy hardens from 390 MPa (in the annealed state) to 1385 MPa after being 53% cold drawn and then to 1935 MPa on subsequent aging of the cold-drawn material at 600&#176;C for four hours. Furthermore, the alloy was found to show a 50% reduction in area before failure in tension tests of the cold drawn and aged samples. The mechanisms of the primary and secondary hardening obtained through cold working and subsequent aging have been investigated in this study by optical and transmission electron microscopy investigations on deformed and deformed and aged samples. Some of the interesting observations made in our study include: (i) Plots of strain hardening rate versus stress (or strain) in simple compression of annealed MP35N indicate four distinct regimes of strain hardening which when suitably normalized were found to be in excellent agreement with the corresponding measurements in several other low stacking fault energy fcc alloys. (ii) The amount of secondary hardening in MP35N depended critically on the amount of plastic deformation imposed prior to aging. It was observed that a strain of about 0.2 was needed before secondary hardening could be detected and that the increase in strength by secondary hardening saturated at a strain of about 0.6. (iii) Simple compression deformation on samples that exhibited significant secondary hardening produced extensive micro-scale shear banding. The extent of shear banding increased with increased levels of secondary hardening and macro-scale shear bands were noted in compression of heavily deformed and aged samples. (iv) Measurements of plane strain fracture toughness revealed that the 53% cold-worked samples retained high toughnesses (about 120 MPa m112) even after the secondary hardening. The formation of shear bands noted above did not seem to effect either the fracture toughness or the ductility of the deformed and aged samples compared to the deformed only samples upto about 53% reduction levels in cold-drawing. Beyond about 60% reduction levels in cold-drawing, the ductility of the deformed and aged samples was observed to drop precipitously. A detailed investigation using the optical microscope and TEM was undertaken to explain the above observations. We are presently attempting to correlate the microscopy observations to the results from the mechanical testing. These results and our current understanding of the physical origin of the properties described above will be presented.

<P>
Material characterization tests for tensile, creep-rupture, low cycle fatigue and fatigue crack growth responses were conducted on P/M U720 forged disc alloy subjected to a specified heat treatment. The purpose of this investigation is to examine the effects of the thermomechanical processes on the high temperature mechanical behavior of this material with a special attention to the creep-rupture, low cycle fatigue and fatigue crack growth rate. The results of analysis are mainly based on the phenomenological approach and predicted methods so that the quantitative comparison can be presented. in addition, the fracture morphologies of the material at 538&#176;C and 650&#176;C were also investigated by SEM and optical metallography to determine the relationships of failure modes, relative fatigue and creep-rupture life to the grain size, local microstructure and defect inclusions resulted from different consolidation processes.

While copper, having critical grain sizes greater than about 20 &#181;m, will twin above a critical, plane-wave shock pressure of about 20 GPa, {111} deformation twins are essentially absent below impact craters or along dense rod penetration channels in copper plates (1.3 to 3.5 cm thick) where instantaneous (plane-wave impact) shock pressures exceed 100 GPa; for spheres and rods impacting at velocities between 1.5 and 6.7 km/s, with densities ranging from 2.2 to 17.6 g/cm3. However, deformation microbands consisting of elongated, dense dislocation wall structures (0.1 to 0.4, am wide), coincident with primary {111}planes; occur in bands or zones removed several millimeters from the crater or penetration channel walls, and predominantly in grains which exhibit little or no (plastic) distortion. These microbands possess misorientations ranging from 1 to 3&#176; and appear to be created as a consequence of intense shear wave phenomena associated with these unique, high strain, high-strainrate deformation regimes. They also occur amongst dense, equiaxed, dislocation cells whose misorientations are &lt;1&#176;, and appear to be related to {111}deformation twins or twin faults which also emerge from or occur amongst, dislocation cells in plane-wave shock loaded copper, for example.

<P>EFFECTS OF HEAT TREATMENT AND MO CONTENT ON THE MICROSTRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FE-NI-CR-MO HIGH TEMPERATURE GEAR STEELS:</B> Cha-Yong Lim, Sung-Joon Kim, Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials, #66 Sangnam-Dong, Changwon, Kyungnam, Korea 641-010
<P>
The effects of heat treatment and Mo content on microstructure and mechanical properties of high temperature gear steels have been investigated. High temperature gear steels require temper resistance, hot hardness, fracture toughness and impact strength for operation at elevated temperatures. The compositions (wt.%) of gear steels studied in this work were Fe-2.0Ni-l.0cr-(1~3.15)Mo-2.0Cu-0.4Mn-0.llC steels. The ingots manufactured by the vacuum induction melting were hot-rolled at 1473 K to 15mm thickness. The hot-rolled plates were quenched and tempered at various conditions. The degree of secondary hardening is increased with the Mo content due to the precipitation of fine alloy carbide (Mo2C) during tempering treatments. Continuous cooling transformation diagrams were obtained. High temperature mechanical tests (Hardness, Toughness, Impact energy) were conducted. Cylindrical compressive specimens of 8mm diameter and 12mm height were machined from the hot-rolled plates. High temperature compressive tests were carried out in an compression testing machine at various strain rates. The microstructure aRer deformation was investigated. The deformed structure was dynamically recrystallized at higher temperatures and lower strain rates. Activation energy and flow equation at high temperatures were discussed.

<P>MICROSTRUCTURAL CHANGE DURING SUPERPLASTIC DEFORMATION IN LOW ALLOYED Zn-Al ALLOY:</B> W.B. Lee, T.K. Ha, C.G. Park, Center for Advanced Aerospace Material, Univ. of Sci. &amp; Tech., POSTECH, Pohang, 790-784, Korea
<P>
Microstructural change and deformation behavior have been observed in superplastic Zn-Al alloys. Row-alloyed Zn-Al alloys, which contains a small fraction of precipitates at grain boundary, showed superplastic deformation behaviors even at room temperature, while pure Zn is very brittle. In the present study, the effects of aluminum composition (up to 1 wt.%) on the change in the microstructure (the role of precipitates) as well as dislocation structure have been investigated during the superplastic deformation. TEM in situ deformation was also performed to investigate dislocation behavior at grain boundary during superplastic deformation of low alloyed Zn-Al alloys.

<P>EFFECTS OF YIELD STRESS AND TEXTURE ON DELAYED HYDRIDE CRACKING IN Zr-2.5Nb PRESSURE TUBE:</B> In Sup Kim, Je Yong Oh, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon 305-701, S. Korea
<P>
The delayed hydride cracking (DHC) in pressure tubes is caused by diffusion of hydrogen atoms into crack tip region, precipitation of hydride, and consequent fracture of the hydrided region under stress. To explain DHC quantitatively, many models have been proposed and the Puls model has been well recognized among them. In this study, the effects of yield stress and texture on DHC have been investigated in Zr-2.5Nb pressure tube material and experimental results were introduced and compared to Puls DHC model. The delayed hydride cracking velocity (DHCV) increased with yield stress, while the threshold stress intensity factor increased as yield stress decreased. The activation energy of DHCV was dependent on the texture. When the direction of crack propagation was longitudinal, the activation energy was 34kJ/mol. However, in the case of circumferential propagation, the energy was measured as 17kJ/mol.

<P>DEVELOPMENT OF TEXTURE AND MICROSTRUCTURE DURING COLD ROLLING OF Ni3Al(B,Zr):</B> <I>B. Bhattacharya</I>, R.K. Ray, Department of Materials and Metallurgical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur-208016, India
<P>
The present report deals with textural as well as microstructural developments during cold rolling of a two-phase Ni3Al(B,Zr) alloy. Basically a pure metal type texture was obtained at lower levels of deformation, while a mixed type (both pure metal and alloy type) was observed at high strain. The transition was detected after about 35% reduction which was correlated with a possible structural transformation in the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">/phase. The change of deformation mode from slip to twinning in <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> was confirmed by electron microscopy. However, the second phase (Ni-base, disordered <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> phase) in the alloy is not known to suffer any change in the deformation mode with straining. Therefore, it is suggested, that the textural development in the two phases will be of different nature; the combined effect will be reflected in the form of the textural change for the whole sample, as mentioned above.

<P>
In a previous study, niobium was identified as the principal embrittling element for oxygen-enhanced crack growth in nickel based alloys, such as Inconel 718. Niobium was believed to come principally from the oxidation and decomposition of niobium-rich carbides at the grain boundaries. To better establish their type density and distribution, g.b. carbides in Inconel 718 that were exposed by crack growth at 700&#176;C or by hydrogen embrittlement were characterized by SEM and EDS. The carbides were also analyzed by high-resolution AEM. Two types of carbides were identified; those associated with the primary NbC, and those (secondary carbides) that formed during heat treatment. The results will be presented and discussed in relation to environmentally assisted crack growth.

<P>THE INFLUENCE OF CARBON LEVEL ON SULFIDE PARTICLE DISTRIBUTIONS IN TITANIUM MODIFIED STEELS OF THE AF1410 TYPE:</B> <I>Luana E. Iorio,</I> Warren M. Garrison, Jr., Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213
<P>
Earlier studies showed that small titanium additions to the 0.10 wt. % carbon steel HY180 lead to the gettering of sulfur as particles of Ti2CS. The Charpy impact energy of HY180 when sulfur is gettered as MnS is about 160J but increases to about 270J when sulfur is gettered as Ti2CS. The improvement in toughness is attributed to the particles of Ti2CS being more resistant to void nucleation than particles of MnS. The effects of small titanium additions on sulfide and other second phasae particle distributions and the toughness of AF1410 steel at carbon levels of 0.16 wt% and 020 wt% are being investigated. The results indicate that titanium additions lead to a substantial improvement in toughness at a carbon level of 0.16 but the improvement in toughness is less at a carbon level of 0.16 but the improvement in toughness is much less at a carbon level of 0.2. The objective of the work reported here is identification of sulfide type and measurement of sulfide size in these two higher carbon steels. Because of the large number of possible sulfides of titanium the major emphasis has been on identifying sulfide type from transmission electron microscopy diffraction results.

The effect of annealing time and temperature as well as cooling rate on the phase stability of the t' phase zirconia will be discussed. A working T-T-T diagram will be proposed.

<P>
Phase stability in NbCr2-based transition-metal Laves phases is studied in this paper, using data from binary X-Cr, Nb-X, and ternary Nb-CrX phase diagrams. It was shown that when the atomic size ratios are kept identical, the average electron concentration factor (e/a = the average number of electrons per atom outside the closed shells of the component atoms) is the determinate factor in controlling the phase stability of NbCr2-based transition-metal Laves phases. The e/a ratios for different Laves phase structures were determined as follows: with e/a &lt; 5.76, the C15 structure is stabilized; at an e/a range of 5.88-7.53, the C14 structure is stabilized; with e/a &gt; 7.65, the C15 structure was stabilized again. A further increase in the electron concentration factor (e/a &gt; 8) leads to the disordering of the alloy. The electron concentration effect on the phase stability of transition-metal A3B intermetallic compounds and Mg-based Laves phases is also reviewed and compared wit'n the present observations in transition-metal Laves phases. Finally, experimental results on Cr-Nb-Cu ternary system were also presented and explained in light of the e/a ratio correlation with phase stability.

<P>
The mechanical behavior of shape memory alloys is closely related to the martensitic phase transformation. A martensitic transformation is considered to be a first order solid state structural transformation that is diffusionless and whose initial phase maintains metastability. Conventional models, such as the &quot;exponential model&quot; and the &quot;cosine model&quot; do not describe the martensitic transformation satisfactorily. In this study, the martensitic transformation curves for thermoelasaticity and pseudoelasticitiy are obtained by using the principle of energy balance. The results are in good agreement with experimental results for steels and nitinol alloys.

The effect of curvature on the chemical potential for binary systems, at constant temperature and pressure, is usually given in the literature by the Gibbs-Thomson equation. Many forms of this equation have appeared in the literature, that can be shown to be incorrect and in violation of the condition for chemical equilibrium for a two-phase system. A simple self-consistent procedure to derive the Gibbs-Thomson equation for binary systems is provided. The resultant equation for the chemical potential shift is independent of the solution model and has an inverse dependence on the width of the two-phase field.

<P>
The boundary in a two dimensional grain structure decreases its length during grain growth. Four distinct processes may contribute to this length change: 1) The smooth motion of the grain edges toward their centers of curvature; 2) Migration of cell corners resulting from the edge motion; 3) The annihilation of small grains (topological process b); 4) The switching process (topological process II). Using von Neumann's assumption that the local velocity is proportional to the local boundary curvature and geometrically general kinematic equations, the contribution of each of these four processes is assessed The result is a kinetic equation in which the metric and topological contributions to the rate of grain growth in two dimensions are made explicit.

PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE IN FLASH SMELTING FURNACE OPERATION AT SAGANOSEKI SMELTER & REFINERY:</B> Yoshiaki Suzuki, Chikashi Suenaga, Masatoshi Ogasawara and Yutaka Yasuda, Saganoseki Smelter & Refinery, Nippon Mining & Metals Co., Ltd., Saganoseki, Oita-Ken 879-22 Japan
<P>
Since 1973, Saganoseki Smelter & Refinery had operated two flash smelting furnace units together to produce copper of 330,000 metric tons per year until quite recently. Economical situation in 1990s,  however, required the smelter to improve the productivity to be competitive in the copper smelting industry. Under the above circumstances, the program for the smelter was drawn up in order for a single flash furnace unit to produce copper at the same level as that with the two flash smelting furnace units. The program was carried out with a lot of modifications of facilities and equipment to double the throughput of a single flash smelting furnace unit, including the pneumatic concentrate drying system, the concentrate feeding system, the concentrate burner, the furnace cooling system, etc. A new large cryogenic oxygen plant was also constructed to replace the two old plants. The production with a single flash smelting furnace unit started in March 1996. This paper describes details of the modifications and results of the operation.

The Mitsubishi process has many advantages pertaining to economical and environmental matters. These advantages have led to the installations of the Mitsubishi process at new smelters being under construction. The Mitsubishi process utilizes highly oxygen-enriched blast air and uses a special lime slag in the C-furnace. These characteristics change the distribution of impurities from other processes which use PS converters. Recently an increased amount of secondary materials which contain impurities is being treated at Naoshima Smelter. In order to cope with an increment of impurities load and maintain the cathode quality, many improvements have been implemented. The paper discusses the impurities behavior in the Mitsubishi process and describes the measures taken to treat an increased amount of secondary materials.

Mitsubishi Continuous Copper Converter employs the top blowing lance system for the continuous supply of reaction gases into the molten bath. In order to avoid the excessive refractory wear caused by the melt splash without loss of the reaction efficiency, the furnace design and the blowing condition should be optimized. Empirical equations which correlate the splashing rate on the side wall with the dimensions of the furnace, lance position, lance size, gas velocity and bath properties were obtained by the physical model study, and compiled into a computer program. The computer program is effectively utilized for the analysis of the actual operation and for the optimum design of new furnaces.

Smelter data from 42 plants have been examined in conjunction with available thermodynamic data of systems related to the pyrometallurgical production of copper. By combining this information with the recently reported sulfied capacity data on fayalite slags, it has been possible to calculate the entrained copper losses and the equilibrium copper losses in industrial slags. A Copper Pyrometallurgy Diagram showing the oxygen pressures and the sulfur pressures in copper production, a Copper Smelting Diagram showing oxygen pressure, sulfur pressure and the copper, sulfur and magnetite contents of slags when producing different matte grades by smelting a Partition Coefficient Diagram for copper smelting have been developed. These diagram are useful guides for the understanding of the thermodynamics of copper pyrometallurgy, for process control and for smelter to set their copper recovery targets.

<P>SEPARATION OF RARE EARTHS, THORIUM AND URANIUM DURING MONAZITE PROCESSING BY SOLVENT EXTRACTION USING 2-ETHYL HEXYL PHOSPHONIC ACID MONO 2-ETHYL HEXYL ESTER:</B> <I>N.S. Narayanan</I>, V.R.

<P>
Monazite, one of the major sources of rare earths, is normally opened by digestion with hot concentrated caustic soda solution. Caustic digestion dissolves phosphate and leaves a hydrated mixed metal oxides cake containing thorium, uranium and rare earths. By leaching this cake with hydrochloric acid at pH 3.0 to 3.2 bulk of the rare earths are preferentially removed and separated. The slurry left after removal of major portion of rare earths contains all the thorium and uranium present in the feed monazite. In addition this slurry also contains substantial quantities of rare earths. Solvent extraction tests were carried out to develop a process to separate rare earths, thorium and uranium present in the mixed chloride solution obtained by dissolving the above slurry in hydrochloric acid.

<P>PREPARATION OF DYCL3 BY DEHYDRATION IN A FLUIDIZED BED:</B> <I>Johan Sundstr&ouml;m</I>, Department of Metallurgy, Division of Process Metallurgy, The Royal Institute of Technology, S-100 44, Stockholm, Sweden.
<P>
Anhydrous DyCl3 was prepared from its hexahydrated mother-compound by batch-wise and continuous dehydration using a fluidized bed. A gas mixture of variable composition between argon and HCl was used. The productivity was high, reaching values of 0.28 mol H2O/m2xs during the dehydration to DyCl3xH2O and 0.079 mol H2O/m2xs during the dehydration to DyCl3. By using an overall reaction rate equation, developed from previous findings it was possible to predict the outcome of the continuous fluidization process. The fluidization process efficiency decreases drastically when water content is below DyCl3xO.1H2O. Therefore, in a final treatment the last traces of water were removed by slowly purging gas through a fixed bed.

MASS SPECTROMETRIC STUDY OF VAPORIZATION PROCESSES AND THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF DyF3-Dy2O3:</B> <I>V.L. Stolyarova</I>, S. Seetharaman, The Royal Institute of Technology, S-100 44, Stockholm, Sweden
<P>
In the present work the vaporization processes and thermodynamic properties of the DyF3-Dy2O3 system were studied at the temperatures 1173-1423 K in the concentration range from the individual DyF3 to the individual Dy2 by the Knudsen effusion mass spectrometric method. It was found, the DyF3, DyOF, Dy2OF4 molecules were the main species in vapour. The DyF3 activity in the DyF3-Dy2O3 system was calculated by comparing the total ion currents of dysprosium triufluoride over the system and the individual component. The influence of the cell material (Pt, Mo, Ta) on the concentration of the DyF3, DyOF, Dy2OF4 vapour species in the gaseous phase over the DyF3-Dy2O3 was illustrated. Results, obtained in the present study are in agreement with the available information on the phase diagram of the DyF3-Dy2O3 system.

We report on the preparation of YBCO sintered sample by a novel technique named &quot;Explosion Method&quot;. The stoichiometric ratio of the compounds were mixed and the powder was encapsulated in the quartz tube. The capsule exploded at 16-hours for specific mass of the product and the size of the tube. The powder was pelletized and characteristic properties were checked. The detailed investigation is carried out on the mass of the product and the size of the capsule which plays an important role in the preparation of superconducting phase, in this method. It has been observed that explosion is important for the superconductivity. The absence of annealing is an advantage in this process, however, the sample deteriorate with time.

<P>
<P>The developing understanding of fracture by hole growth is reviewed, 
with mention of unsolved problems: Tipper in the late 1940's showed not only 
the idealized limiting micro-mechanisms of fracture by cleavage and by 
hole growth, but also the current problems of linkages of holes by irregular 
fine cracks and cleavage with concurrent plastic deformation. 
Both micromechanisms can lead to either ductile or brittle structures; the 
Irwin-Williams stress intensity concept K; the Paris fatigue crack correlation; 
elastic-plastic fracture instability in sheet, the Hutchinson, and Rice and 
Rosengren annular J-fields for initial and early growth of cracks in power-law 
materials; The K-T and J-Q extensions; fracture mechanics for predicting the 
behavior of large structures from tests on small, perhaps fully plastic specimens; 
traditional and fitness-for-service design and maintenance; the finite 
element method; its strength, current limitations, and needs; history effects, 
including the wolf's ear fracture, very low cycle fatigue, and torsion; micro-models 
of crack formation and growth; McClintock and Gurson; extreme value 
idealizations in statistics; cooperative and multi-stage problems; crack 
roughening and three-dimensional effects; recent work on rigid-plastic; 
non-hardening mechanics of initial and continuing growth of cracks, both with and

<P>ELASTIC-PLASTIC FRACTURE MECHANICS OF STRENGTH-MISMATCHED INTERFACE CRACKS:</B> <I>David M. Parks, </I>S. Ganti, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139
<P>
Recent progress in rationalizing and predicting the diverse ductile and brittle cracking behaviors seen in a given structural alloy under monotomic loading (i.e., shallow versus deep cracks; tension versus bending; ductile growth versus cleavage, etc.) has rested critically upon improved characterizations of elastic-plastic crack-front stress and deformation fields. For macroscopically homogeneous elastic-plastic materials, these improved descriptions of the crack-front fields typically include a parameter such as <I>J</I> or <I>CTOD</I> which scales the intensity of crack-tip deformation, as well as a parameter such as the <I>T</I>-stress or the <I>Q</I> parameter which accounts for the triaxiality of the crack-tip fields. When a crack lies along or near a planar material interface across which there is a significant gradient in plastic deformation resistance, the local stress and deformation fields exhibits features which differ both in magnitude and in kind from the homogeneous fields noted above. Such conditions are encountered in strength-mismatched weldments, in which the flow strength of the weld metal, <I>Ywm</I>, differs that of the baseplate, <I>Ybp</I>. Major features of such strength-mismatched interface fields are that (i) for a given macroscopic characterization of crack-tip deformation (in terms of <I>J</I> or <I>CTOD</I>), deformation preferentially focuses in the softer material, and (ii) stress triaxiality in the softer material exceeds that attainable in even the most severe of the homogeneous fields noted above. We review basic features of strength-mismatched interface crack fields as determined from finite element solutions under well-constrained and fully plastic conditions, for a range of strength mismatches and strain hardening behaviors. The fields can be well-described with slip-line fields appropriate to the level of strength-mismatch. Implications of these fields for the toughness of interface cracks are noted.

<P>IN-PLANE CONSTRAINT EFFECTS IN ELASTIC-PLASTIC FRACTURE MECHANICS: </B><I>John W. Hancock</I>, J. Li, A.D. Karstensen, A. Nekkal, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Glasgow, Scotland G12 8QQ, UK
<P>
McClintock (1971) has shown that under plane strain conditions, the fully plastic flow fields are not unique, but depend on geometry and loading. In mode I, the loss of uniqueness is shown to originate from the nature of the elastic field and in particular the sign of the non-singular <I>T</I> stress. The nature of these fields is elucidated by constructing a family of plane straw slip line fields (Du and Hancock 1991). As such they belong to a family of fields which can be described by <I>J</I> and a second parameter which determines the level of crack tip constraint (<I>Q/T</I>). This family of fields are deviatorically similar but differ largely hydrostatically (O'Dowd and Shih 1991, Beteg6n and Hancock 1991). Boundary layer formulations have been used to infer the force on mixed mode slip line fields in contained yielding (Hancock, Karstensen and Nekkal 1996). These differ from those discussed by Shih (1974) in that plasticity does not surround the crack tip, due to the occurrence of an-elastic wedge on the crack flanks. Both mode I and mixed mode fields for weakly stain hardening materials can be interpreted as belonging to a single family such that constraint loss by mixed mode loading. This gives a family of fields which differ largely hydrostatically on the plane of maximum hoop stress. Finally slip line fields for cracks on the interface between a rigid subsume and a perfectly plastic material, subject to mixed mode loading have been constructed, and these are also discussed in terms of constraint effects (Li and Hancock 1996). Experimental data on the effect of in plane constraint on fracture toughness is discussed within the framework of two parameter fracture mechanics. Finally the methods by which constraint enhanced toughness can be used in safety cases based on failure assessment diagrams is discussed (MacLennan and Hancock 1995).

<P>THE ROLE OF FRICTIONAL CRACK SLIDING ON THE COMPRESSIVE FAILURE OF ICE AND ON ITS BRITTLE-TO-DUCTILE TRANSITION:</B> <I>Erland M. Schulson</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Thayer School of Engineering, 8000 Cummings Hall, Darthmouth College, Hanover, NH 03755
<P>
In 1962 McClintock and Walsh pointed out that frictional sliding across the surface of closed cracks inclined to the direction of loading is an important element in brittle compressive failure. The friction reduces the effective shear stress on the crack plane and so lowers the stress concentrated at the crack tip. Frictional sliding thus increases the far-field stress for out-of-plane wing crack initiation and growth, thereby raising the failure stress (e.g., Brace and Bombolakis 1963, Nemat-Nasser and Horii 1982, and Ashby and Hallam 1986). This paper will show that the brittle compressive failure of ice can be understood in terms of the frictional crack sliding/wing crack mechanism, and that its brittle-to-ductile transition can be explained by incorporating crack-tip creep.

<P>
Mode I crack initiation and growth under plane strain conditions in tough metals have been successfully simulated using an elastic-plastic continuum model which accounts for void growth and coalescence ahead of the crack tip. A row of void-containing cell elements is placed on the symmetry plane ahead of the initial crack. These cell elements incorporate the softening characteristics of the hole growth and its strong dependence on stress triaxiality. Under increasing strain, the voids grow and coalesce to form new crack surfaces thereby advancing the crack. The material parameters are the Young's modulus, yield stress and strain hardening exponent of the metal and two additional parameters, <I>D</I> and <I>fo</I>, characterizing the dimension of the cell element and the initial volume fraction of the void centered within the cell. Once the above material parameters have been calibrated for the material under investigation, the model can be applied to compute relationships among load, load-line displacement and crack advance with no restrictions on the extent of plastic deformation and crack advance [Xia and Shih, (1995a and 1995b)]. The model has been applied to several specimen geometries which are known to give rise to significantly different crack tip constraints and crack growth resistance behaviors. Computed results are compared with sets of experimental data for two tough steels. Details of the load, displacement and crack growth histories are accurately reproduced [Xia, Shih and Hutchinson, 1995]. Suitably defined measures of crack tip loading intensity, such as those based on the J-integral can also be computed; however such crack growth resistance curves no longer play the central role in this approach. The above model has been employed in the transition regime where a crack initiates an grows by ductile tearing but final failure can occur catastrophic cleavage fracture. Crack growth causes significant alterations in the stress field, the process zone size, the competition between ductile and brittle processes and the sampling volume. The effects are accounted for by incorporating weakest link statistics into the cell element model. The cleavage fracture model also takes into account the increase of sampling volume with crack growth and the competition between void nucleation from carbide inclusions and unstable inclusion cracking which precipitates catastrophic cleavage fracture. Load-displacement behavior, ductile tearing resistance and transition to cleavage fracture are discussed for several different test geometries and a range of microstructural parameters. The model predicts trends in the ductile/brittle transition region that agree with experimental data [Xia and Shih, (1996)].

<P>
Since the discoveries of bulk amorphous alloys in Ln-Al-TM, Mg-Ln-TM and Zr-Al-TM (Ln=lanthanide metal, TM=transition metal) systems for the last several years, great attention has been paid to bulk amorphous alloys. It was subsequently reported that bulk amorphous alloys were formed in Ti-Zr-TM, Zr-Ti-TM-Be and Pd-Ni-Cu-P systems. The maximum thickness reaches 40 mm and the critical cooling rate is of the order of 1K/s. However, there have been no data on bulk amorphous alloys with ferromagnetism at room temperature. We have derived three empirical rules for the achievement of large glass-forming ability from previously reported bulk amorphous alloys. Based on the three rules, we have searched new ferromagnetic bulk amorphous alloys and succeeded in finding several ferromagnetic bulk amorphous alloys in Fe-, Co- and Ln-based systems. The Fe-based bulk amorphous alloys exhibit good soft magnetic properties of 1.3 T for magnetization, 2 A/m for coercive force (Hc), 7000 for permeability at 1 kHz and 21x10-6 for magnetostriction. The Ln-based bulk amorphous alloys were prepared in the diameter range up to 15 mm and exhibited rather good hard magnetic properties of high Hc of 400 kA/m and maximum energy products of 20 kJ/m3. These discoveries seem to be promising for future progress of bulk amorphous alloys.

The development of several families of multicomponent alloys which 
form metallic glasses at relatively low cooling rates has triggered renewed 
interest in thermodynamic and kinetic properties of undercooled liquid metals as 
well as glass formation. Results of studies of atomic diffusion, viscosity, 
specific heat, liquid phase separation, and crystallization kinetics will be surveyed 
for alloys in the Zr-Ti-Ni-Cu-Be and Zr-Ti-Ni-Cu-Al systems. Containerless 
processing studies of the undercooled melts using electrostatic and 
electromagnetic levitation will be described. Liquid phase separation, impurity 
effects, and heterogeneous crystal nucleation are found to play an important and 
often unanticipated role in the crystallization kinetics. This has led to new 
understanding of the factors which govern glass formation in these bulk 
glass forming materials.

<P>
<P>Crystallization occurs by nucleation and growth. Growth may be 
primary, eutectic or polymorphic. Crystallization statistics as performed by TEM 
indicate heterogeneous nucleation with large transient times below the glass 
transition; nucleation and growth rates obey Arrhenius equations with 
activation energies typical for diffusion. Above glass transition homogeneous 
nucleation has been found and kinetics can be described best by 
Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equations. From Crystallization studies typical 
metal-metalloid glasses are fragile, but the new bulk amorphous alloys are strong 
glasses. Amorphous phase separation prior to crystallization not only increases 
the glass forming ability, but also leads to the formation of nanocrystalline 
structures. Phase separation might be responsible for the strong influence of 
oxygen and hydrogen on the crystallization of Zr-based metallic glasses. 
Some bulk amorphous alloys transform into quasicrystals. Their nucleation 
and growth rates are measured in detail. The relation between glass-forming 
ability, existence of Laves phases and formation of quasicrystals will be discussed.

Fluxing techniques have been used to study the undercooling and vitrification of glass-forming binary, ternary and quaternary alloy melts. By reducing and neutralizing heterogeneous nucleation centers, molten Pd10Fe30Ni40P20 were undercooled to 303 K or 0.26 T<I>m </I>below its melting temperature T<I>m</I>, while bulk amorphous Pd-Ni-P and Pd-Cu-P alloy rods with diameters ranging from 7 to 25 mm were synthesized over a wide composition range. The crystallization temperatures T<I>x </I>and the glass transition temperatures T<I>g </I>of these bulk amorphous alloys were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). For most bulk amorphous Pd-Ni-P alloys, the difference <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-delta.gif">T=T<I>x</I>-T<I>g</I> is larger than 90 K, and bulk amorphous Pd40Ni40P20 cylinders with 25 mm in diameter can be easily fabricated. <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-delta.gif">T for bulk amorphous Pd-Cu-P alloys is smaller than for amorphous Pd-Ni-P alloys, and exhibits a dependence on the phosphorus concentration which peaks near 20 at.% P. The glass formability of Pd-Cu-P was increased substantially when part of Cu was placed by Ni. Our results demonstrate that the critical cooling rates for glass formation in Pd-Ni-P and Pd-Cu-Ni-P alloys are the lowest among all known bulk metallic glass forming systems. The density, microhardness, elastic properties, specific heat and the glass formation range of these alloys will be reported.

THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS FOR INTERFACES: GRAIN BOUNDARIES IN COVALENT MATERIALS AND METAL-CERAMIC INTERFACES:</B> <I>Masanori Kohyama</I>, Dept. of Material Physics, Osaka National Research Institute, AIST, 1-8-31, Midorigaoka, Ikeda, Osaka, 563, Japan
<P>
For distorted configurations at interfaces in covalent materials or for interfaces between dissimilar materials, it is difficult to develop reliable interatomic potentials. For such systems, it is desirable to perform electronic structure calculations so as to clarify the stable configurations and microscopic nature. Currently, such kinds of enormous calculations are becoming possible by virtue of the development of the efficient theoretical methods and the high-performance computers. In this paper, we present our recent band-theoretical calculations for grain boundaries in Si, SiC and diamond, and for Al-SiC interfaces. First, grain boundaries in covalent materials have been dealt with by using the transferable tight-binding method [1]. For those in Si, general features of stable configurations and general relations between local structural disorder and local electronic structure are clarified. These are compared with those in diamond. For those in SiC, effects of interfacial C-C or Si-Si bonds and interfacial stoichiometry are analyzed. Second, <I>ab initio</I> calculations for grain boundaries in Si and in SiC have been performed by using the first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) method [2]. Stability of the structural models and the nature of interfacial C-C and Si-Si bonds in SiC are analyzed more quantitatively. Third, <I>ab initio</I> calculations for Al-SiC interfaces have been investigated [3]. The features of Al-C and Al-Si interactions at the interfaces are clarified.

The microstructure of nearly stoichiometric TiAl alloys, which are important candidates for high-temperature applications, consists of lamellae with L10 and DO19 structures. A serious limitation is their low room temperature ductility. The failure often occurs by cracking along the lamellar interfaces and one clue to the fracture propensity is the atomic structure of these interfaces. To investigate this atomic structure we first carried out atomistic calculations employing Finnis-Sinclair type central force many-body potentials. However, calculated atomic structures exhibit some significant discrepancies when compared with high-resolution electron microscopy observations. For this reason further calculations have been made using an ab initio electronic structure full-potential method. An excellent agreement between calculated and observed structures was then attained. This result can be interpreted in terms of the covalent type bonding across the interface. This emphasizes significance of directional bonding in TiAl which may play an important role in its mechanical behavior. *Research supported by the U.S. Dept. of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Grant No. DE-FG02-87ER45295 and NEDO.

These potentials have been constructed for B2 NiAl by fitting a number of equilibrium properties of the alloy and reproducing the asymmetric behavior of constitutionals point defects in off-stoichiometric NiAl. At the same time, these potentials assure the structural and mechanical stability of the B2 lattice. It was found that in stoichiometric NiAl alloy boundaries in surplus of Al atoms have appreciably lower cohesive strength than the stoichiometric boundaries or boundaries in surplus of Ni atoms. From the structural point of view, boundaries in surplus of Al possess the largest expansion and are associated with large &quot;holes&quot;. On the other hand, boundaries with the stoichiometric configuration or in surplus of Ni atoms have more compact structures. The segregation of the antisite defects and vacancies at grain boundaries was also investigated by performing molecular static and Monte Carlo calculations. It was found that no antisite defects are favored at grain boundaries at the stoichiometric bulk composition. In the case of Ni in surplus in the bulk Al atoms have strong tendency to segregate to the boundary region. The effects of such grain boundary features upon the mechanical properties of NiAl will be discussed.

<P>GRAIN BOUNDARY STRUCTURE TRENDS IN B2 COMPOUNDS</B>: Batsirai Mutasa, Diana Farkas, Yuri Mishin, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061
<P>
The relaxed atomistic grain boundary structures in B2 aluminides were investigated using molecular statics and embedded atom potentials in order to explore general trends for a series of B2 compounds. Free surface energies and grain boundary structures were studied in three compounds, FeAl, NiAl and CoAl. These alloys respectively have increasing anti-phase boundary energies. The misorientations chosen for detailed study correspond to the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-sigma.gif">5(310) and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-sigma.gif">5(210) boundaries. The effects of both boundary stoichiometry and simulation block stoichiometry on grain boundary energetics were considered. Chemical potentials and point defect energies were calculated for boundaries contained in both stoichiometric and off-stoichiometric bulks. The surface energies for these B2 aluminides were also calculated so that trends concerning the cohesive energy of the boundaries could be studied. The implications of stoiciometry, the multiplicity of the boundary structures and possible transformations between them for grain boundary brittleness are also discussed.

When two crystals are in contact, the interaction between the atoms at or near their interface often orients the crystals in a unique way. Usually, one of the two crystals is a matrix or a substrate, and the other crystal is a precipitate within the matrix, or a deposit on the substrate. In this talk, a recently-proposed method for predicting the orientation relationship (OR) between two crystals is described and experimental cases of film/substrate composites are compared with the predictions of the model. The case of three-dimensional OR, where the film-substrate orientation relationship is maintained irrespective of the substrate surface on which the film is grown, is described, and this is compared with those cases where multiple ORs may be favored resulting on the dependence of the OR on the substrate surface. Finally, the physical basis of the model is described in terms of the energy minimization of adatoms deposited on a rigid substrate.

We are investigating Al/Al2O3 interface structure using thin films fabricated by deposition of aluminum from an effusion source onto (0001) sapphire under UHV conditions. Structural considerations suggest that the metal would grow to match the close-packed metal planes and directions with the close-packed oxygen ions of the sapphire substrate, i.e., (0001)Al2O3//(111) metal and [10-10]Al2O3//[-110]metal. Although this orientation is predominant, transmission electron microscopy observations also show the existence of two additional types of orientation relationship, corresponding to rotations of 30 degrees and ~11 degrees from the primary domain orientation. A comparison of the predictions of atomistic calculations for the interface structure and dislocation configuration with the results of high resolution and conventional transmission electron microscopy observations will be presented.

Grain boundary embrittlement by impurity or alloying elements is a common and technologically important phenomenon, of which the embrittlement of Cu by Bi is a classic example. Investigations, using the near edge fine structure in the electron energy loss spectrum (EELS), have indicated that there is a change in bonding at the grain boundaries associated with the segregation of Bi. Namely, there is a decrease in the density of the d states for Cu atoms at the boundary when Bi is present. The effect of variations in grain boundary misorientation on the Bi segregation levels and on the near edge structure will be described. Comparisons between results from EELS and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) will also be made. (Supported by NSF (DMR 93-0625)

<P>
Product development in a growing small business can be difficult due to lack of internal expertise or facilities. Often technology is not developed due to an apparent lack of appropriate resources. We discuss the long standing and on-gong strategic technology transfer programs at the Kurt J. Lesker Company. We leverage financial resources (internal, government, customer) with technical resources (internal, university, customer), to develop new products and processes which are more effectively manufacturable. Our research programs serve to establish us as a manufacturer of exceptional deposition systems and component, and as an engineering firm with the knowledge which a manufacturer of devices and systems requires. It is the combination of our deposition systems and process technology which will ensure that this firm is regarded as a world leader in materials science. By allowing our company to perform research and development efforts which we would not have otherwise undertaken, our funding sources thus contribute to business growth, direct company growth, academic research, education of graduate students and researchers, and local economic growth as a result of increased employment.

Recent advances in the synthesis of light-weight metallic materials will be reviewed with emphasis on developments which have occurred since the last symposium in this series. Primary consideration will be given to alloys based on aluminium, magnesium and titanium both in monolithic and composite configurations. Emphasis will be on synthesis/processing/fabrication rather than the more traditional microstructure-mechanical property relationships.  Particular attention will be given to the status of commercialisation of high performance light-weight metallic materials.

Of potential practical hydrogen storage materials (HSM), pure Mg would be best from the standpoint of hydrogen capacity per unit mass. However, pure Mg has poor hydrating reactivity due to surface oxide poisoning and low catalytic activity. Mg-Ni is a well-known attentive that is more stable against oxidation. The Ni aids catalysis of the H2 dissociate chemisorption and produces additional benefits by lowering the dehydrogenation temperature, but at the expense of a decrease in storage capacity. Theoretical considerations suggest that nanostructured Mg with low concentrations of both Ni and Fe will be an optimum Mg-based HSM. We have prepared submicron Mg-(Ni,Fe) pseudoalloys by bail milling and report here on the hydrogen storage characteristics.

Two laminate systems based on titanium alloy IMI834 and titanium metal matrix composite (MMC) have been manufactured by diffusion bonding. The S-type laminate contain 50% MMC in the outside layers and 50% Vol. IMI834 in the middle of the laminate. The C-type laminate contains the same volume fraction of IMI834 and MMC, but here the MMC is in the middle of the laminate. Bonding parameters: temperature, pressure and time have been optimised. Effective Young's Modulus and bend strength have been investigated using four-point bend tests, and impact fracture toughness of the laminates and control samples have been assessed by using an instrumented impact testing. For un-notched specimens, 100% IMI834 has highest fracture toughness with lowest E and strength; MMC, in contrast, has higher strength and lowest fracture toughness. However, for notched specimens, both of them have lower strength and fracture toughness compared with the S-type laminate. The measured stiffness (E) for the S-type laminate was greater than that for IMI834 by about 1.7. By laminating materials, the impact fracture toughness of S-type laminate for un-notched and notched specimens, compared with 100% MMC material, increased by about 2.7 and 4.6. Young's modulus strength, and fracture toughness can be optimised by selecting different structures. Lamination by combining tough matrices and reinforced components is an effective way to improve toughness for high strength materials, like MMC, and the properties of the materials can be tailored according to a particular application.

<P>PROCESSING OF Ti/SiC COMPOSITES: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE FOIL-FIBRE-FOIL AND THE TAPE-CASTING TECHNIQUES: </B><I>Zheng Xiao GUO</I>, Department of Materials, Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London, Mile End Road, London E1 4NS, UK
<P>
Ti-based SiC fibre reinforced composites are strong, stiff and light-weight materials for high temperature applications up to 700-1000&#176;C. As with any other advanced materials, their development has to overcome both economic and technical hurdles. Here, a study into the foil-fibre-foil and the tape-casting processing techniques is reported. The fundamental procedures involved in the techniques are compared and discussed. Possibilities of reducing product costs are analysed. Due to the reactive nature of titanium, the composites must be processed under minimum thermal exposure to reduce undesirable fibre/matrix interfacial reactions: on the other hand, care should also be taken not to use too low a temperature or too large a pressure in order to avoid fibre breakage. This requires an optimum balance of the processing temperature, pressure and time. Therefore, both theoretical and experimental investigations were conducted for the consolidation of aligned fibre mats with matrix foils or with matrix powder-tapes. The effects of processing parameters, such as temperature pressure and time, on the mechanisms of identification are evaluated. Predictions of the process model are compared with experimental findings, which shows satisfactory agreement. Various types of interfacial defects and fibre breaking have been analysed in relation to the processing parameters and fibre/matrix lay-ups. Consequently, defect- and reaction- free composites have been obtained. This is particularly successful with the assistance of a temporary hydrogenation procedure using either pre-hydrogenated foils or powder particles during processing.

A new process for vacuum plasma spray manufacturing of multi-ply Titanium/SiC fibre MMC rings has been developed. Material produced can be identified easily by subsequent vacuum hot pressing or HIP. Ti and Ti-6A1-4V matrices have been 'spray-wound' with C coated and C/TIBx coated DRA Sigma SiC fibres. Characterisation by electron microscopy has identified interfacial reaction products, showing that the fibre/matrix reaction is similar to that for plasma sprayed monotapes. SiC fibres chemically extracted from the matrix have been subjected to tensile and bend testing to quantify process damage for spray-wound and foil/fibre material. This has shown that fibre damage from spray/winding is of a similar magnitude to that from foil/fibre processing. Possible mechanisms for fibre damage during processing have been identified.

The consolidation of continuous matrix-coated fibre Metal Matrix Composites, MMC, has been investigated using a theoretical as well as an experimental approach. A numerical, quantitative model has been developed for the solid-state consolidation of continuous Matrix-Coated Fibre, MCF, Metal Matrix Composites. In addition, an experimental verification programme was conducted using two different samples types, one produced under normal conditions and one containing yttrium maker layers. The marker layers were used to make the matrix deformation visible, which occurs during the consolidation, and hence offered the opportunity of a direct comparison of the predicted matrix deformation and the experimentally determined matrix deformation. The materials investigated were continuous Textron SCS-6 SiC fibres in a Ti-6A1-4V metal matrix. The fabrication route chosen was the Matrix-Coated Fibre method, developed by the DRA Farnborough, UK. In this method, the fibres are pre-coated prior to consolidation with the matrix material using Electron Beam Evaporation, a Physical Vapour Deposition technique. The thickness of the matrix-coating and hence the final fibre volume fraction of the composite can easily be varied by adjusting the coating time. For the consolidation to the final composite the matrix-coated fibres are stacked, degassed placed into a titanium container and hot-isostatically pressed. The analytical model is based on a Finite Element Model, FEM.

Continuous silicon carbide fibre-reinforced titanium-based metal matrix composites offer many advantages over conventional monolithic materials including high strength-to-density ratio. However, there is a need to design an improved protective coating for the silicon carbide fibre to combat interfacial chemical reactions as well as to accommodate large mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the SiC fibre and titanium matrix. This paper describes the strategy for designing coating for continuous silicon carbide fibre and reports on a new coating system based on a compliant layer/ reaction barrier concept developed for titanium metal matrix, composites including those based on <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiA1. The newly developed coating system, designated FUWT1. consists of Gd/GdB3 where the Gd layer (adjacent to SiC) works as a compliant layer while the GdB3 layer works as a reaction barrier. The results of this work indicate that the FUWT coating perform well both a reaction barrier (protect the SiC fibre from reactions with titanium up to 100&#176;C) and a compliant layer (absence of thermal cracking in AiA1 based composite). The interfacial shear strength of an as-fabricated SiC/FUWT/Ti-6A1-4V was found to be higher than the presently available SCS6/Ti-6A1-4V and Sigma (SM1240)/Ti06A1-4V composites.

<P>
This paper describes the synthesis of high modulus steel for automobile parts with an emphasis on its alloy-designing concept and phase equilibrium. Titanium diboride (TiB2) particles have been verified to be the best reinforcement for improving isotropic Young's modulus of steels. The calculated phase diagram shows that TiB2 has a narrow tow-phase equilibrium window with carbon-free Fe-Cr-Ti ferric steel and has neither solubility of iron nor chromium. Those thermo-dynamical stability's of TiB2 are responsible for maintaining its own high Young's modulus of 540GPa in the ferocity steel. Both pre-mixed and in-situ TiB2 particles effectively reinforced the ferocity steel matrix. The developed steel with 30vol.%TiB2 showed a Young's modulus of 280GPa which apparently corresponded to 350GPa due to its reduced density of 6.6g/cc compared with 7.8g/cc of the conventional steel.

<P>
Over the past 10 years, three major advances in reactive sputtering technology have made it possible to deposit both conductive and non-conductive fully-dense films at high rates. These three advances are unbalanced magnetron (UBM) sputtering, partial pressure control of the reactive gas, and pulsed DC power. Multicathode UBM sputtering systems provide a dense secondary plasma that produces well-adhered, fully dense films. With both pulsed-dc power and partial pressure control, films such as aluminum oxide can now be deposited reactively at rates up to 78% of the pure metal rate. The reactive UBM sputtering process is used to deposit polycrystalline nitride superlattice films such as TiN/NbN or TiN/VN with hardnesses exceeding 50 GPa, more than double the hardness of either component in the film. The nitride superlattice work is being extended to oxide films. Clear, amorphous, nano-layered Al2O3/ZrO2 films have been deposited at high rates with a hardness of 10 GPa. Work is underway to deposit these films in a crystalline form, which should enhance their hardness.

<P>CONTROL OF INTERFACE STRENGTH IN NIOBIUM-ALUMINUM OXIDE MULTILAYERS BY ION BEAM ASSISTED DEPOSITION: </B><I>G S. Was</I>, H. Ji, J.W. Jones, Cooley Bldg., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; N. Moody, Sandia National Laboratory, Div. 8712, MS 9403, Livermore, CA 94551
<P>
The toughness of a niobium-aluminum oxide multilayer depends on the interface strength, which can be controlled by both the orientation relationship of the constituents and the composition at the interface. As a first approximation to multilayers, niobium films were deposited onto {0001} sapphire substrates by ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD) under various conditions. In addition to the {110} fiber texture, strong in-plane texture was introduced by simultaneous ion bombardment. Stronger in-plane texture was developed with higher ion energy and ion to atom arrival rate ratio (R ratio). Different orientation relationships at the niobium-sapphire interface were achieved by varying the orientation of the sapphire substrates with respect to the ion beam incident direction. The hardness and modulus of the niobium layer were also modified by the ion bombardment. A dopant (Ag) was introduced at the interface at levels from a fraction of a monolayer to one monolayer during niobium layer deposition.

<P>CONTROLLING THE EVOLUTION OF TEXTURE IN SPUTTER DEPOSITED Mo FILMS:</B> <I>S.M. Yalisov</I>, J.C. Bilello, University of Michigan, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Ann Arbor MI 48119
<P>
Evolution of crystallographic ordering in sputter deposited polycrystalline refractory metal films has been observed in several laboratories. While the ordering in the growth direction, out-of-plane texture, is well known, the ordering in the plain of growth, in-plane texture, has only been reported by the ion enhanced growth community. The work presented here, will describe the conditions required for this behavior in the presence of energetic ions. Mo films were sputter deposited on amorphous substrates and grown to a large variety of thickness. The homologous temperature does not exceed 0.2 in any of the experiments performed. These films were characterized by a large battery of synchrotron x-ray, electron microscopy, and surface analysis. The data have led to an atomistic model to explain and predict the in-plane texturing based on shadowing and anisotropic growth rates which force a competitive grain growth mechanism during the growth. Detailed comparison to experiment will demonstrate the role that limited diffusion and mass transport play in the final microstructure of the film. Examples of how this model can be exploited to design a particular microstructure will be presented.

<P>CERAMIC-METALLIC COATINGS BY ELECTRON BEAM PHYSICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION PROCESS:</B> Douglas Wolfe, M. Movchan, <I>Jogender Singh</I>, Applied Research Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16804
<P>
Electron beam physical-vapor deposition (EB-PVD) process is considered to be a cost-effective and robust coating technology that has overcome some of the difficulties or problems associated with the metals spray, CVD and PVD processes. The EB-PVD process offers many desirable characteristics such as relatively high deposition rates (up to 100-500 mm/minute with an evaporation rate ~10-15 Kg/hour), dense coatings, precise composition control, columnar and poly-crystalline microstructure, low contamination, and high thermal efficiency. Various metallic and ceramic coatings (oxides, carbides, nitrides) have been deposited at relatively low temperatures. EB-PVD has the capability of producing multilayered nanolaminated metallic/ceramic coatings on large components by changing the processing conditions such as ingot composition, part manipulation, and electron beam energy. Attachment of an ion beam source to the EB-PVD process offers additional benefits such as dense coatings with improved adhesion.

<P>
Commercial plasma source ion implantation (PSII) equipment built by North Star Research Corporation has recently been installed at Empire Hard Chrome, Chicago, IL. Los Alamos National Laboratory has assisted in this commercialization effort via two Cooperative Research and Development Agreements to develop the plasma source for the equipment and to identify low-risk commercial PSII applications. The PSII system consists of a 1m x 1m cylindrical vacuum chamber with a pulsed, inductively coupled rf plasma source. The pulse modulator is capable of delivering pulses with peak currents of 100 kV and peak currents of 300 A at maximum repetition rate of 400Hz. The pulse modulator uses a thyratron to switch a pulse forming network which is tailored to match the dynamic PSII load. This presentation will focus on early commercial applications to production tooling and manufactured components and characterization of implanted coupons.

<P>SPUTTERED CHROME NITRIDE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ELECTROPLATED CHROME</B>: <I>Michael Graham</I>, Keith Legg, Paul Rudnik, Peter Chang, BIRL, Northwestern University, Evanston IL 60201
<P>
BIRL has been involved in hardcoating development for engineering applications for several years. A major effort over the past four years has focused on the replacement of electroplated chrome in applications where the steel substrates have moderate hardnesses (Rc38-42) and therefore only modest support for hard PVD coatings. Much of the development work has been supported by the government through DARPA as part of an environmental thrust to eliminate pollution sources and health hazards from their OEM's as well as their repair facilities. BIRL has developed the use of duplex processing (plasma nitriding + sputter-coating) and thick PVD coating (15-20um) with CrN and demonstrated wear performance characteristics superior to commercial chrome plating. This paper reviews some of the process developments involved in these programs and the wear test results. Production cost estimates have also been conducted for certain components, and it has been demonstrated that PVD coating is competitive with electroplating when the total manufacturing process is taken into account.

<P>
TiN films were deposited onto stellite 6B alloy (Co base) by the reactive magnetron sputter ion plating. As the substrate bias increases, TiN film changes from columnar structure to dense structure due to densification and resputtering by ion bombardment. Oxygen, the major impurity, is decreased greatly when the substrate bias is applied. The preferred orientation of the TiN films changes from (200) to (111) with decreasing N2/Ar ratio. The change of the preferred orientation is discussed in terms of surface energy and strain energy which are related with the impurity contents and the ion bombardment damage. The hardness of the TiN film increases with increasing compressive stress generated in the film by virtue of ion bombardment. <P>

<P>TRANSITION METAL CARBIDES AND NITRIDES FOR ELECTRONIC DEVICES:</B> <I>Wendell S. Williams</I>, Department of Physics, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801
<P>
The need for thermally stable, diffusion-resistant but electronically conducting materials for interconnects in ultra large scale integrated circuits has led to the successful application of transition metal carbides and nitrides, particularly TiN. Another application is the use of superconducting NbN to make Josephson junctions NbN/Si/Nb and Nb/MgO/NbN. And high-temperature resistors with nearly zero temperature coefficients have been made from TaN. This family of materials, sometimes called &quot;metallic ceramics,&quot; can be deposited as thin films by several processes, including reactive sputtering, metal-organic chemical vapor deposition and plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition. An interesting but potentially troublesome characteristic of these NaCl-structured materials is their wide range of deviation from stoichiometry, involving many percent random atomic vacancies, scattering centers for conduction electrons. Hence film preparation requires that the non-metal/metal ratio be close to unity. It is not widely recognized that these defect-ridden crystal structures are non-equilibrium phases: when cooled slowly from high temperatures, some develop ordered phases with lower resistivities.

<P>
Systematic studies of the influence of local microstructure on electromigration (EM) dynamics in submicron Al(0.5 wt % Cu) interconnects were performed using in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. This approach has allowed us to observe in real-time voids forming, growing, migrating, pinning, failing a runner, and healing, all with respect to the detailed local microstructure of the runners. Here we will report and describe how grain boundaries dramatically influence almost all aspects of EM-induced void and failure dynamics in submicron runners. We also find a striking change in EM-mechanism as a function of temperature in the range 200-300&#176;C. Studies as a function of linewidth and passivation state were also performed. Our findings have important implications for both electromigration modeling and conventional reliability testing.

<P>
Novel dopant activation in the heavily boron-doped p+-Si was created by applying an electrical current of high current density. The heavily boron-doped p+-Si was obtained by ion implantation and annealed at 900&#176;C for 30 min to achieve a partial boron activation. For additional activation, we gradually applied current until a current density of 2.5X10E7 A/cm2 was reached. The resistance of the p+-Si responded by a gradual increase, then it decreased with a precipitous drop. The resistance was reduced by a factor of 5 to 18. Mechanisms of the novel dopant activation will be proposed. Dopant activation in the heavily arsenic-doped n+-Si will also be discussed.

<P>
The FCC phase in Cu-Fe-Ni ternary system contains a miscibility gap within which tie-lines extend from nearly pure Cu toward the Invar composition, Fe - 36% Ni. This suggests that it should be possible to prepare alloys containing isotropic distributions of Invar within high conductivity, Cu-rich, matrices, and that the Invar fraction can be controlled by selecting starting compositions at various points along the tie line. The resulting combinations of low thermal expansion with high electrical and thermal conductivity will be of interest in the electronic circuit packaging industry. Technical difficulties in developing such alloys arise from incomplete solid solubility at high temperatures at the Cu-rich end of the series and from the slow approach to complete chemical phase separation at low temperatures. Quaternary element additions and mechanical deformation processes are being explored as approaches to creating more nearly homogeneous starting alloys. Microstructural developments and electrical and thermal properties will be reported and discussed.

The optimum aging condition for obtaining peak electrical conductivity has been determined. In addition, it is found that an appropriate amount of cold working can further enhance the electrical conductivity of the composite. The related mechanism has also been studied.

<P>
A concept for point feeding of alumina to S&oslash;derberg cells has been developed at Hydro Aluminum Karm&oslash;y. During 1996 and early 1997 the bar breaker equipment on all 340 cells will be replaced by point feeders. Alumina is fed by means of a fluidized feeder and mechanically forced into the bath. The lifetime of the equipment is comparable to that of the cathode life. The concept has proved to stabilize the operation of the cell. Furthermore, the stability improves the current efficiency and also allows the amperage to be increased. Implementation of point feeding includes revised operational procedures and new target values for the operational parameters and also affects the organization. The anode effect frequency has been reduced in several steps during the development period. Today, the anode effect frequency is about one tenth of the corresponding value for the previous bar breaker cells resulting in reduction of perfluorocarbon emissions.

<P>
<P>A new instrument, with a single-chip microcomputer as its core and based on a new method named Dynamic Temperature Measurement, has been developed for fast temperature measurement in aluminium reduction cells. When a cold thermocouple is inserted into hot electrolyte, the instrument measures the thermocouple output curve and meantime identifies the parameters of a time series-analysis model which is used to describe the temperature-time curve. Until the convergence of the identification is verified, the instrument predicts the temperature of the electrolyte from the obtained information. In the way, the temperature can be indicated before the thermocouple output reaches its balance point, with the measurement process lasting only some 50 seconds and measurement accuracy reaching &#177;2&#176;C, a range acceptable for industrial measurement.

<P>
A new device is suggested here to cover the cell and feed alumina into it. The covering is designed having such thermal resistance that no crust develops on the electrolyte surface. Alumina is fed from the intermediate hopper, which is one piece with the covering plate, into the electrolyte through the narrow slot, the width of which ranges from 0.8 to 1.2 mm. The alumina feed rate is determined by its bulk properties (&quot;sandy&quot;, &quot;mealy&quot;, &quot;moist&quot;), the width and length of the slot and the intermediate hopper wall flare angle. The cold model of the device yielded the dependencies of alumina slot spead on the parameters mentioned above. The device has no crust-breaking appliances or volumetric dosers. Dosage is effected only to gravity feed of raw materials through a slot of predetermined cross-section. Because of that, low operation costs and high reliability of the suggested device are expected.

VISUALISATION OF TAPPING OPERATIONS:</B> <I>Marcus Walker,</I> Comalco Research Centre, P.O. Box 316, Thomastown, Australia 3074
<P>
<P>The removal of molten aluminium from Hall- Heroult cells is known a &quot;tapping&quot;. This operation causes process disturbances including entrainment of electrolyte and sludge in the tapped metal as well as producing localised wear of the cathode. This paper describes the use of a full scale physical model for determining the optimal tapping conditions to reduce both bath entrainment and cathode erosion for various cell operating strategies. Flow visualisation and numerical modelling has shown that the flow towards the tapping pipe is predominantly radial, however under and inside the pipe, the flow swirls intensely. Under certain conditions the swirling flow induces a vortex at the bath metal interface through which bath can be entrained in the flow. The swirling action was also seen to produce a region of locally high velocities on the cathode surface which enhances erosion of the cathode through a number of possible mechanisms.

<P>
A mathematical model to describe the solidification behaviors of atomized droplets during flight, in terms of nucleation temperature, recalescence temperature, nucleation position, solid fraction at nucleation temperature, and droplet temperature and velocity, is formulated. The concept of transient nucleation is applied to model such short nucleation event. A maximum droplet velocity exists, beyond which droplet velocity shows an inflection phenomenon during the flight. For shorter flight distance, smaller droplet is faster to reach a given flight distance; however, for longer flight distance, the situation is reversed. Variations of the gas flow patterns have more effects on smaller droplet, and the effects are more significant at longer flight distance. A minimum surface heat transfer coefficient exists as the droplet flies. Prior to nucleation or recalescence, smaller droplet has lower temperature at a given flight distance, and has lower nucleation temperature. Medium size droplet flies over the shortest flight distance before the nucleation starts. Smaller droplet has larger solid fraction at the end of recalescence. Atomization gas has more effects on droplet momentum than on the heat content of the droplet.

It is well known that the air gap that forms between casting and mold during the solidification process of an aluminum alloy substantially alters the rate of heat transfer at this interface. This paper reports studies on the effect of force cooling a composite permanent mold on the initiation and growth of the air gap. Interesting comparisons are made with the case where no forced cooling is employed. The two experiments are simulated using a fully coupled thermo-mechanical model called VULCAN, a finite element code, and its temperature and displacement predictions are validated. The air gaps are measured using LVDTs. The alloy used is A356, and the mold comprises H13 steel and beryllium-copper. Air jets are used to force cool the mold component surrounding an isolated thick section of the casting. The inverse heat conduction problem is solved in order to obtain boundary conditions for VULCAN.

<P>
<P>Results from mathematical models and plant experiments are combined to quantify the effect of transverse depressions and oscillation marks on heat transfer in the continuous casting mold. A heat transfer model has been developed to calculate transient heat conduction within the solidifying steel, coupled with the steady-state heat conduction with the continuous casting mold wall. The model features a detailed treatment of the interfacial gap between the shell and mold, including mass and momentum balances on the solid and liquid powder layers. The model predicts the solidified shell thickness down the mold, temperature in the mold and shell, thickness of the resolidified and liquid powder layers, heat flux distribution down the mold, mold water temperature rise, ideal taper of the mold walls, and other related phenomena. The important effect of non-uniform distribution of superheat is incorporated using the results from previous 3-D turbulent fluid flow calculations within the liquid cavity. Results from plant experiments confirm that transverse surface depressions and oscillation marks form at the meniscus and move down the mold. Measurements of mold thermocouple temperatures and breakout shell thickness were used to calibrate the models. The predicted local surface temperature fluctuations were consistent with transient mold temperature measurements. The results indicate that the surface depressions and oscillation marks are filled with mold flux, but still have a significant effect on decreasing heat transfer, especially locally. Insights are gained into the formation of associated surface cracks and breakouts.

<P>This paper shows a mathematical model based on finite elements, applied to bottom cast ingots of C.V.G Sidor Plant. The model was used as a strategy to determine the thermal effects that are produced when the solidification conditions are modified, without interfering with the production process. The modification consisted of placing a thermal insulant on top of mould. The results obtained by the model indicated that the solidification time increases with insulant on top of the mould. With these results a significant number of casts were run with and without insulant. Later by means of a metallurgical analysis it was determined that the ingots cast with insulant reduce the level of nonmetallic inclusions and the presence of internal blistering in seamless pipes.

<P>Mainly due to the strong yen and the relatively low metal price, the zinc refineries in Japan are being forced to reduce man power. At IIjima, a new automatic material - handling system for cathode transportation was developed and the first system went to service in August 1994. The work was started in 1993 and all installation will be finished in the summer 1997. The critical part of this work was to achieve the designed cycle time because of the fairly complex cell-layout. As the cathodes are placed opposite direction in every other unit, cranks must be able to move toward two directions (X and Y) at the same time and to stop precisely at the tolerance level of a few millimeter. The central monitoring system for machine operation run by an original application software with MICROSOFT EXCEL&#169; on WINDOWS 95&#169;, was started in June 1996. There had been one person only for operating a manual crane before. Now an operator of a stripping machine can control the automatic crane for the same row at the same time. As a result, only one person can operate both a crank and a stripping machine for one row. And more labour saving is expected in the future.

<P>
Under the auspicious of the Commission of the European Union, a consortium composed of six European organizations has developed the PLACID process, into the Brite Euram II Programme. The project began on January 1993 and was finished on April 1996. The PLACID process is based on a novel technology able to deal with different lead bearing materials, mainly lead oxide secondaries: Lead-acid batter pastes, lead fumes, furnace slags, oxide residues, etc., producing &quot;four nines&quot; pure lead in an efficient manner with a benign influence on the environment. In the PLACID process, lead is leached in warm, slightly acidic, brine to form soluble lead chloride. This solution is purified by cementation with lead powder. Pure lead is then won from the lead chloride electrolyte on the cathode of the electrowinning cell and is collected. This electrolytic cell is the heart of the process and it was especially developed to give optimum performance. Hydrochloric acid is reformed in the cell and returned to the leaching bath; reagent net consumption in the process is irrelevant. This paper is concerning the development of the PLACID electrowinning cell up to industrial size electrodes. The performed work has covered three levels of development: laboratory study, bench scale experimentation and pilot plant prototype testing (16 Kg/h electrolytic lead production). After 1,000 hours operating time, the achieved results of the pilot plant electrowinning cell have been very satisfactory, demonstrating the ability of the Placid electrowinning cell to produce top quality electrolytic lead (above 99.99% Pb) with high current efficiency and low energy consumption.

<P>CHARACTERIZATION OF ANTIMONY-GELATIN ADDITIVES IN ZINC SULPHATE ELECTROLYTES USING IMPEDANCE ANALYSIS:</B> X. Tang, Southwire Copper Division, 372 Central High Rd., Carrollton, GA 30117; P.

<P>
Impedance measurements were used to investigate the electrochemical characteristics of acidic zinc sulphate electrolytes containing Sb3+, gelatin and their mixtures. The data were correlated with cyclic voltammetry curves made using synthetic as well as industrial electrolytes. The cyclic voltammetry results were similar to those obtained in previous studies in that antimony caused a depolarizing effect while gelatin gave an increase in the potential for zinc nucleation on an aluminum substrate. The electrochemical impedance spectroscope (EIS) evaluations were conducted on electrodeposited zinc at three overpotential values. The potentials were chosen to represent various current density regions in the zinc polarization curves. The antimony and gelatin gave characteristic impedance plots which correlated with expected behaviour, particularly current efficiency. Both antimony and glue appear to modify the intermediate zinc reaction sequence, but in different ways. The data strongly suggest that film formation and stability are major factor in the zinc ion reduction mechanism.

<P>EFFECTS OF ANTIMONY AND CONTINUOUS GELATIN ADDITION ON CURRENT EFFICIENCY IN THE HUDSON BAY ZINC ELECTROWINNING TANKHOUSE: </B> P. Merrin, Hudson Bay Mining &amp; Smelting Co., Limited, Flin Flon, Manitoba, R8A 1N9, Canada
<P>
This study was conducted at Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting's zinc electrowinning tankhouse to determine the effects of varying levels of antimony and continuous gelatin addition on current efficiency. The levels of antimony and gelatin were varied between 0.010-0.030 mg/l and 0-10 mg/l respectively, using the fresh electrolyte as reference. The test was designed to determine the optimum operating point for current efficiency, and to investigate any interaction that occurs between the two components. An non-linear mathematical model relating these three variables was produced, giving an optimum operating point of 6.5 mg/l of gelatin and increasing current efficiency with decreasing antimony levels. Individually, the antimony concentration was approximately linear with current efficiency, while gelatin concentration was parabolic. An interaction term is present but is not significant enough to improve the ability of the tankhouse to handle purification upsets in antimony.

<P>
<P>The effects of five commercially available foaming reagents (range of 0 to 25 ppm) namely Dowfroth 250 Saponin, Yucca, Licorice and Meta-Para Cresol on acid mist control, current efficiency, polarization behaviour, and deposit morphology and orientation were investigated using a bench scale electrolysis apparatus (cell volume 3L). The deposition was carried out at 500 Am-2 and 38&#176;C for 3 hours from Kidd Creek zinc electrolyte. The acid mist control capability of the various reagents was studied and compared by characterizing the foam layer generated during actual electrowinning conditions and by direct quantitative measurements of acid mist levels on top of the electrowinning cells. Within the range considered, the addition of these reagents reduced the current efficiency, refined the grain size of the deposit, and changed to preferred orientation of most of the deposits. Among the reagents tested, acid mist measurements indicated that Licorice and Dowfroth 250 were the best acid mist suppressant at emissions of 0.30 mg/m3 and 0.31 mg/m3 respectively while Yucca and MPC produced the most mist at 3.0 mg/m3 and 3.3 mg/m3 emission rates respectively.

<P>
<P>In Japan, almost 30% of steel is produced by electric arc furnace (EAF) melting of iron scrap. And the dust from EAF includes approximately 20-30 wt % of Zn and 3.5 wt % of C1. They are treated as industrial waste to recover Zn as Zn oxide mainly by pyro metallurgical process. On the other hand, high purity zinc recovery by direct hydro-metallurgical processing is one of the most effective method. In this case, Cl in the EAF dust is dissolved in liquid phase by leaching, but the Cl anion in electrolyte attacks anode which is made of a lead base alloy. Several processes have been proposed to remove Cl anion from acidic sulfate solution. In this study, an electrolytic process is established to eliminate Cl anion from Zn sulfate electrolyte. It is known that Cl anion can be removed by anode oxidation. From our study it can be said that the elimination rate of Cl anion depend on the anode material, i.e. the elimination rate is Pb - Ag alloy &gt; Pb DSE. Furthermore in industrial electro-winning process, electrolyte includes Mn dioxide. Therefore, the effect of Mn in electrolyte should also be considered for Cl elimination. It seems that Mn dioxide deposition on anode decreases the efficiency of Cl anion removal. The periodical reverse system was induced to prevent from efficiency decrease. By using periodical reverse system, deposited Mn dioxide is removed very rapidly when the current was reversed for short time. More than 95% of Cl anion can be removed in extremely short period than conventional method. At the symposium the detailed data will be presented about Cl anion elimination by periodical reverse system.

<P>THE ROLE OF COPPER AND ANTIMONY ADDITIVES IN THE REMOVAL OF COBALT FROM ZINC SULPHATE SOLUTIONS: </B> V. Van der Pas, D. Dreisinger, University of British Columbia, Department of Metals and Materials Engineering, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6T 1Z4 Canada
<P>
<P>Zinc sulphate electrolyte used for zinc electrowinning must be purified for cobalt ions. The cobalt is removed in a cementation stage by the addition of zinc dust. Copper and antimony are frequently used additives which enhance the cementation of cobalt. This paper aims at a better understanding of how copper and antimony promote the removal of cobalt. Initial experiments were done in a batch cementation reactor. Copper and antimony precipitated in the early stages of cementation indicating that a preferential substrate was formed. The individual role of copper and antimony was further investigated in an electrochemical cell. On a microscale, the growth process, morphology and the composition of the precipitates under various conditions were examined with SEM and XRD. It was found that cobalt could not be deposited in its pure form but as a cobalt-zinc alloy with zinc as the prime constituent. The effect of copper addition is of increasing the cathodic surface area of zinc dust by precipitating as numerous dendrites. Antimony acts as a cathodic surface onto which a cobalt-zinc alloy with an increased cobalt content is deposited.

<P>
<P>Small diameter electric immersion heaters offer unique benefits when used in molten aluminum heating applications. The 1&quot; diameter heaters allow greater flexibility in vessel design than traditional immersion heating systems. The electric heating elements are inside a Sialon sheath, which is non-wedded by molten aluminum and offers long life. Since the development of these heaters, they are being used in many different types of molten aluminium holding vessels. Pechiney Aluminium Engineering utilizes these small heaters in Alpur degassing vessels and the Pechiney Deep Bed Filter Heaters are also used in die casting holding furnaces for both primary and supplemental heating applications. The net result of using the small immersion heaters is high metal heat-up rates, compact vessel designs, energy savings, uniform metal temperatures, and user friendly equipment designs. The paper describes the capabilities of the heaters, the design flexibility they allow, and performance results obtained from initial installations.

<P>
<P>For forty years, the Aluminum Industry has conducted and sponsored investigations directed at establishing a better understanding of the safety aspects associated with the sometimes explosive occurrence which may happen when there is a physical contact between molten aluminim and water. Industry concern has resulted in a poling of resources among companies, associations, and technical organizations. There has been a substantial funding of investigative projects conducted by capable research organizations employing sophisticated techniques. While useful information has been gained and translated into operational procedures, the basic cause remains elusive. A completely different, and additional, investigative approach is suggested based on cumulative experience and observation of daily occurrences. This can provide the informational basis to alleviate the safety and liability concerns associated with direct contact between molten aluminum and water.

<P>Traditionally industrial twin roll casters have been operated at gauges 6-7 mm, depending on the type of caster and the final product requirements. Over the past few years it has become apparent that a significant increase in productivity can be achieved when the casting gauge is reduced. Hydro Aluminium embarked on an extensive R &amp; D thin gauge casting program in the beginning of the 1990's, and this paper presents results of a five year lasting project (joint program between Hydro Aluminium and Lauener Engineering). Based on over 400 casting trials the major benefits and limitations of casting at reduced gauge and increased speed are outlined. Important aspects for product quality are discussed including: cooling rates and dendrite structure, microstructural characteristics (as-cast grain structure and texture), segregation behaviour, surface quality and mechanical properties after thermomechanical processing. Results for casting of several alloys (including the 5xxx and 8xxx-system) are given. Additionally, numerical modelling results of the strip casting process are included.

<P>MAGNETIC EDGE DAMS IN A TWIN ROLL ALUMINIUM CASTER: </B>Craig Anderson, Peter Davidson, Engineering Department, Cambridge University, Cambridge CB2 1P2, United Kingdom
<P>
In the twin roll casting process, molten aluminium is fed between two cooled rotating rollers where it cools, solidifies and is carried by roller rotation to the nip, where it is compressed to a single sheet and expelled. To prevent aluminium escaping laterally, from the roller edges, dams are required. Physical edge dams are subject to erosion from the rollers and molten metal and require maintenance and replacement. Hence there is a strong economic case for using magnetic edge dams, where the interaction of a magnetic field and a current provide sufficient repulsive force to contain the molten aluminium, which do not physically touch either the rollers or molten metal and require little or no maintenance. This paper discusses the theory behind high frequency magnetic edge dams and describes the design and construction of a practical system. Laboratory testing of the magnetic edge dam system is shown to give good agreement with theory and the installation and operation of the system on an experimental twin roll caster is described.

The technology for recycling aluminium scrap has evolved over a number of years through five major changes as follows: direct charging, side bay melter with puddlers, rotary furnaces, shredding and flat belt delacquering machines, shredding and rotary kilns, today it is now possible to fully decoat any aluminium material which can be shredded. With the invention of IDEX&#174; rotary kiln systems all materials from UBC, extrusions, coated foils, through to 6 micron aseptic foils can be successfully reclaimed and either remelted or processed with minimal metal loss. During 1996 three systems have been commissioned in the Americas for decoating materials which contain 3 to 80% VOC by weight and ranging from 4 to 7 tonnes per hour. This paper discusses the changing technology and the current &quot;state of the art&quot; in rotary kiln technology.

Al-TM-Ln alloys (TM... transition metal; Ln...lanthanide) can be rapidly quenched into a fully amorphous state and then partially devitrified to give a nm-scale microstructure of aluminium crystallites uniformly dispersed in an amorphous matrix. This is a highly unusual microstructure for an aluminium alloy, indicating a high density of independent nucleation events in the glass. This study focuses on the development and stability of microstructure in a series of Al-Ni-Y alloys. The effects of various single- and two-stage heat treatments are explored. The emphasis is on the particular features associated with the unusual nm-scale among these is the overlap between coarsening and further transformation arising from capillarity effects on the crystallites.

<P>
This presentation will provide results an the formation and subsequent growth of nanocrystalline aluminum phases in an amorphous matrix. A prototype for this family of metallic glass alloys that can be transformed into nanocrystalline material is the Al90Fe5Gd5 system. Detailed measurements of nanocrystalline isothermal growth from an amorphous Al90Fe5Gd5 matrix were made from 150 to 500&#176;C. Coupled with growth of the nanocrystals, measurements of Gd and Fe segregation between the nanocrystal and the matrix were secured in a TEM with a field emission gun. Both Fe and Gd are preferentially rejected into the remaining matrix as the aluminum-rich nanocrystal grows. After reaching a specific size, which varies with temperature, growth slows down and funkier changes are slight until subsequent nucleation and growth of compound phases. such as Al4Gd occur. The relative stability of the formation of nanocrystals from an amorphous matrix will be addressed. Research supported by the University of Virginia Academic Enhancement Program.

Aluminum-rich glasses containing about 85 at% Al and a combination of transition and rare earth element additions have yielded microstructures of Al nanocrystals in an amorphous matrix with nanocrystal volume fractions approaching 20% and excellent mechanical properties. A high density of nanocrystals (&gt;1020 m-3) develops during the primary crystallization reaction but growth is limited. A new kinetics analysis shows that diffusion field the nanocrystals. The kinetics model has been applied to DSC exotherms that correspond to primary fcc nanocrystal formation. A thermodynamic model of the fcc-liquid phase support heat evolution rate calculations used in the model. The results indicate that modification of the nucleant density should be the primary focus in limiting nanocrystal growth due to reduced length scales.

<P>
Ultrafine amorphous titania particle aggregates, with a mean particle size of 145 nm, were prepared using a hydrolysis technique in an aerosol reactor. Their crystallization bahavior has been studied using transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The amorphous powder crystallized into anatase with a crystallization enthalpy of 27 kJ/mol and an apparent activation energy of 2.0 eV. The anatase phase nucleated preferentially in contact regions between neighbouring particles. This crystallization mode is interpreted as a consequence of the presence of appreciable local pressure (stress) which was predicted by model calculations and observed under TEM. An analysis suggests that the pressure effect reduces the relative stability of the amorphous phase by enhancing the thermodynamic driving force for nucleation and possibly also the crystallization kinetics. The nucleation and growth behavior observed has important implications when these amorphous particles are used as precusors to form nanocrystalline titania. The results are also discussed in comparison with the crystallization behavior reported previously for other ultrafine-structured oxides.

Pressure-induced crystal-to-glass transformations have been observed in tetrahedrally coordinated elements (e.g. Ge, Si), ionic and molecular crystals (alpha-SiO2, FeSiO4, AlPO4, Fe PO4, SnBr4), and hydroxides (ice, Ca(OH)2, Co(OH)2). In these materials, the crystal transforms polymorphically to a higher density glassy phase. Crystal-to-glass transformation have also been observed to occur through pressure-induced reactions between mixtures of elements such as germanium and aluminum.

STABLE VS. METASTABLE PHASE EQUILIBRIA IN FACETED/NON-FACETED METALLIC GLASS SYSTEMS:</B> <I> T.M. Adams, </I>M.J. Kaufman, Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611
<P>
Since metallic glasses can be used as precursors for nanocrystalline structures, it is important to understand the relationship between the transformation characteristics of the stable faceting phases and the metastable ordered phases (MOP's) in faceted/non-faceted systems. Such an understanding of the competitive nucleation and growth kinetics should allow better control of the transformation structures. Following some past work on Al-Ge alloys, it has been proposed that, in general, for faceted/non-faceted systems, no equilibria exist between the MOP's and the stable faceted phases. In order to support this assertion of generality, the Hf-Be and Al-Ge systems are being investigated. Crystallization of amorphous melt spun ribbons and co-evaporated thin films is effected by standard furnace anneals and in-situ electron beam heating. Once annealed, the resulting microstructures are characterized using XRD and TEM. In addition, <I>in-situ</I> hot-stage TEM is used to examine the relationship between the MOP and the stable faceting phase while the transformations are occurring. All of this work is being done in the vicinity of the stoichiometric composition of the most stable MOP (Hf-50Be and Al-50Ge). Basic modelling efforts of the metastable phase equilibria are also under way using THERMOCALC with estimated heats of formation for the MOP's determined through DSC/DTA and empirical formulations.

STRUCTURAL TRANSITIONS IN TI/AL NANOLAYERED THIN FILMS:</B> <I>R. Banerjee</I>, X.D. Zhang and H. L. Fraser, Materials Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; M. Asta, A.A. Quong, Computational Materials Science, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA, R. Ahuja, Multi Arc Scientific Coatings, Troy, MI
<P>
Nanolayered materials often exhibit unusual structural features which are significantly different from those of their bulk counterparts. Such structural transitions could lead to novel properties of the material motivating research directed towards engineering the structure at the nanoscale. Laminated thin films based on Ti, Al and Ti-aluminides have potential application as coatings for components used in high temperature aerospace applications. A series of structural transitions were observed in Ti/Al multilayered thin films on reducing the layer thickness of the Ti and Al layers1. An hcp-fcc transition was found to occur in the Ti layers on reduction of the layer thickness to 5 nm. Al too exhibited an fcc-hcp transition on reducing the layer thickness to 2.5 nm. Interestingly, a 2.5 nm Ti layer had an hcp structure. An atempt was made to explain these transformations in the stacking sequence of the Ti and Al layers using a model initially proposed by Redfield and Zangwill. Subsequently, first principles electronic structure calculations are in progress to determine the effect of bulk, interfacial and thin film strain energies on the structural stability of the multilayers. Initial results suggest that strain energy may be playing a pivotal role in determining the structure.

Rapidly solidified Ti-Ni-Cu alloys prepared by melt spinning were studied. It is found that under super rapid cooling rates alloys with 25-40 at% Cu are formed in initial amorphous state, with 15-25 at% Cu in amorphous-crystalline state, with 15 at% Cu don't become amorphous under spinning. Crystallization heat treatment of amorphous alloys leads to the formation of nano-scale TiNi-based solid solution, which undergo martensitic B2-&gt;B19 martensitic transition in cooling. Temperatures of martensitic transformations for RS-alloys have been established to be lower, than for same alloys prepared under traditional cooling rates, because of nano-scale grain size of B2-phase crystalizing from amorphous structure. The martensite in a nano- and micro grains may have different morphology and orientations. Nanophase (B2-TiNiCu) and nanocomposite (B2+B11(TiCu)) structures formed under crystallization by means of laser treatment, heating effect of electrical current and high temperature treatment were investigated. The ribbons with such structures in optimum state have good elastic and shape memory properties.

<P>
<P>There are three key mechanisms of failure during the life of microelectronic solder joints: overload failure during handling, thermal fatigue failure during service, and, particularly in the case of joints for optoelectronic devices, dimensional changes during service. Each of these failure modes is strongly influenced by microstructure of the solder, which is, in turn, affected by the composition of the solder, the chemical nature of the substrate, and the manufacturing process that is used to create the joint. The present talk will discuss the varieties of microstructure that are found in common solder joints, their influence on lifetime and failure mode, and the metallurgical techniques that can be used to control microstructure and modify the nature and kinetics of joint failure.

<P>
<P>Lead based solders are main stay of the microelectronic industry. Besides their use in printed boards, they are employed in interconnections of Si chip-to-substrates such as the multi-chip-modules, the thermal-conduction-module, the tape-automated bonding etc. During their service, the solder interconnections, commonly known as C-4 joints, are subjected to temperatures of the order of 100&#176;C which translate to homologous temperatures of T/Tm 0.5 where Tm is the melting temperature in Kelvin. At these temperatures, a host of diffusion and related phenomena become operative notably the diffusion in the lattice and grain boundaries, creep and fatigue which eventually determine reliability of the device packaging. We have carried out extensive diffusion studies on the Pb-In and Pb-Sn solders over a range of composition using radioactive tracer techniques. We will discuss therein the various diffusion process, their modifications through ternary solute additions such Au and Cu and the role of unstable microstructure particularly in the eutectic solders.

<P>
Over the last several years, we have experimented with lead-tin eutectic carefully controlled microstructure in order to learn about creep, microstructural evolution, and fatigue cracking in this alloy. The purpose of those experiments has been to formulate a mechanistic basis for modeling the creep-fatigue interaction. In this paper we review the work. Creep tests, tensile tests, and load relaxation tests combined with microstructural characterization and theoretical modeling have helped to provide insight into the roles of dislocations and colony boundary sliding during creep. Colony boundary sliding impacts upon cracking and coarsening during fatigue. Work hardening and dynamic recovery during creep affect subsequent coarsening. Fatigue experiments examining the effects of frequency and strain range on fatigue crack growth have revealed transitions in mode of crack growth accompanying the onset of colony boundary sliding at low strain rates. Experimental studies of the effect of prior deformation on subsequent coarsening reveal that the factor by which coarsening accelerates depends on the rate of deformation. *Supported by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.

A NEW METHODOLOGY TO MEASURE DAMAGING STRAINS IN LEAD/TIN SOLDERS:</B> <I>Abbas I. Attarwala1</I> and Juan M. Sanchez2, 1Hewlett-Packard Company, IC Business Development Division, Palo Alto, CA 94304; 2Center for Materials Science, The University of Texas at Austin, TX 78712
<P>
A new methodology was developed to isolate and measure the damaging strains in lead/tin solders. The new methodology is based on load controlling cycling as opposed to strain controlled cycling. Under load controlled cycling conditions it is easy to separate out the effects of the different strain components. It was determined that the damaging strains were primarily creep strains, even at a cyclic rate of 0.5 Hz at a temperature of -40&#176;C. Fractographic analysis of the fractured specimens confirmed that failure even at -40&#176;C occurs by creep processes. The envelope strain curve generated from load controlled cycling data is a direct measure of the damaging strains stored in the material. A new parameter, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">D was identified. <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">D is the damaging strain stored per cycle. The damaging strains per cycle measured for various solder compositions tested at varying frequencies, temperatures and microstructures could all be correlated by simple linear relationships. It was observed that the damaging strain stored during the secondary creep region of the envelope strain curve ranges from 2% strain to 18% strain depending on the test conditions.

Experiments on deformation and rupture of eutectic Sn/Pb solder will be discussed. These involve <I>in-situ</I> field emission SEM observations made during tensile and thin-walled torsional shear testing at room and elevated temperatures. Deformation concentrates on colony boundaries, leading to cavitation, cracking, and tertiary creep. Cavity formation also induces a large anelastic (time-dependent recoverable strain) effect. Progressive colony boundary damage has been mapped from sequential <I>in-situ</I> images. Subsequent strain field mapping and animations, highlight and quantify the relative deformations.

The mechanical properties (E, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/sigma.gif">0.2, UTS and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif">%) of five Pb-Sn solder alloys (63Sn/37Pb, 62Sn/36Pb/2Ag, 96Sn/4Ag, 95Pb/5Sn, 90Pb/10Sn) commonly used in electronic packaging have been determined over the temperature range of -200&#176;C to 150&#176;C using uniaxial tensile test, dynamic mechanical analysis, and acoustic pulse method. The following results have been found: (1) the elastic moduli decreases linearly with increasing temperature until 70&#176;C, then rapidly drop for the temperature 100&#176;C and above; the strength (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif">0.2, UTS) decreases with increasing temperature with the exception that for the solid solution solder (95Pb/5Sn, 90Sn/10Sn) which remain approximately constant; (3) the ductility change is complex: for lead matrix solid solution solders; the total elongation (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif"><I>r</I>) increasing slowly with increasing temperature, the uniform elongation (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif"><I>u</I>) is relatively high (&gt;20%), and decreases slowly with increasing temperature, and the neck elongation (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif"><I>n</I>) increases sharply with increasing temperature; whereas, for the eutectic solders (63Sn/37Pb, 62Pb/36Ag/2Ag, 96Sn/4Ag), the super-plasticity occurs at high temperature (&gt;100&#176;C), while at low temperature (-150&#176;C) the brittle fracture occurs, the higher uniform elongation occurs at about -100&#176;C.

When a liquid alloy spreads on a substrate, interdiffusion may result in melting of the substrate of the substrate and/or formation of intermetallic phases. We investigate the former case and describe the evolution of the non-planar interface on the lower surface of the drop. An approximate diffusion analysis is performed for a drop whose height is much smaller than its width. The coupling between the melting process and the rate of advance of the triple junction is explored for a variety of contact angle conditions. Numerical solution of the governing equation are performed and compared to experimental results for Bi-Sn alloys spreading of a droplet on a grain boundary.

Pending Federal regulations provide the impetus for using Pb-free solders. Automotive electronics and solders are exposed to thermal cycles in the range of -40&#176;C to 150&#176;C under cyclic and quasi-static conditions, and they experience low and high frequency mechanical fatigue vibrations. Since coarsening of microstructural features is known to affect fatigue resistance, the effects of aging behavior is investigated using eutectic Sn-Ag solder as a model system, with and without intentionally added intermetallic strengthening phases. Small single shear lap specimens with a size similar to joints in microelectronic applications are used to obtain microstructures that are obtained in real solder joints. Eutectic Sn-Ag solder joint microstructures coarsen when aged between 40 and 150&#176;C for as little as a week. The microstructural evolution and its effect on mechanical properties is monitored with ageing temperature and time, and the kinetics of ageing is determined. The effects of adding composite intermetallic phases on the solder interface and ageing behavior are compared to the model Sn-Ag system.

<P>
Forced Diffusion Thermography (FDT), differential temperature detection across a material flaw while providing a controlled AC heat flux input, has been developed recently for structural integrity assessment in large structures. This paper presents FDT to identify microscopic flaws by both finite element analysis and experimentation. The technical difficulties are the production of a microscopic width heat flux line pattern and the spatial and temperature resolution of the infrared camera. A finite element model one millimeter square and one-third millimeter deep of tin solder material with various surface crack sizes specimens with known microscopic flaws were performed using an infrared camera with a temperature resolution of one mK. A seven mW helium-neon laser provided an AC heat input area of 250 micron wide by five millimeters long to the specimen's surface. The results show that this method can be applied to detect flaws in small specimens of solder and similar materials.

SURFACE AND INTERFACE STRESS EFFECTS ON THIN FILM GROWTH</B>: <I>R.C. Cammarata</I>, Surface and Interface Science Branch, Naval Research Laboratory, 4555 Overlook Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20375
<P>
Associated with any solid surface is a surface stress. It is an intrinsic thermodynamic quantity that represents the reversible work per unit area needed to elastically stretch the surface. In materials where there is a large surface area to volume ratio, such as thin films, surface stresses can have a major influence on the growth and structure. In the case of a solid-solid interface, there are two interface stresses that represent the work needed to stretch the two phases on either side of the interface. Simple models for surface and interface stresses will be presented. These will then be used to analyze thin film epitaxial growth as well as intrinsic stress generation in nonepitaxial films. It will be shown that surface and interface stresses play a central role in determining the critical thickness for epitaxy, and can lead to significant intrinsic stresses in nonepitaxial films, especially during the early stages of growth.

<P>
<P>Thin films are typically deposited under severe kinetic constraints, resulting in highly non-equilibrium microstructures. These films often exhibit stress levels far in excess of the bulk yield strength. The origin and evolution of the film stress during deposition is, in most cases, poorly understood. We have developed a technique for real-time measurement of film stress during deposition--the Multi-beam Optical Stress Sensor (MOSS). MOSS is a technique for determination of stress through measurement of the substrate curvature. It has the virtues of low sensitivity to ambient vibration, simplicity of setup, and ease of use. We will describe the technique, and demonstrate its use for the particular case of SiGe heteroepitaxial growth on Si. We first discuss the elastic/plastic behavior of SiGe, and then focus on the surface segregation of Ge during SiGe growth. The latter topic, while somewhat specialized, is well-suited to demonstrate the interpretation of MOSS data, and to highlight both the strengths and limitations of the technique.

Epitaxial growth can be used to control and help understand thin film properties. We use sputter deposition to grow a variety of epitaxial thin film structures, including compounds and multilayers. The large stresses observed in these materials can have a large effect on properties. Using in-situ stress measurements and x-ray diffraction we study the stress evolution during growth and relate this behavior to thin film structure and properties. For Fe on Cu (001), we find that Fe is fcc up to a thickness of 10-12 monolayers, whereupon bcc Fe is observed in first the Pitsch and then the Bain orientations. The fcc Fe shows some relaxation of the misfit from the Cu, as do the Pitsch orientation bcc, which is in tension, and the Bain orientation bcc, which is in compression. In the giant magnetostrictive compound TbFe2, we have used epitaxy and differential thermal contraction to control the stress and hence the orientation of magnetization. This understanding and and control can lead to improved device performance.

Lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) thin films are used in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as piezoelectric components. Both the mechanical and electrical properties of the PZT layer must be known in order to understand the piezoelectic response of the PZT for use as either a sensor or actuator. These properties are controlled by the composition and structure of the PZT film and its interface. Variations in PZT film structure and morphology are caused by changing solution processing conditions. PZT films have been deposited to thicknesses between 400 and 600 nm onto a multilayered electrode structure of platinum, titanium, titanium dioxide and silicon oxide. Nanoindentation has been used to characterize the effects of grain size and structure on the mechanical properties of the PZT films. The effects of the substrate and the multilayered electrode are accounted for to determine the modulus and hardness of the PZT films.

An investigation has been undertaken to study the adhesion of TiN coatings deposited by using CVD process at 900&#176;C on surgical stainless steel. The microscratch test method (CSEM) was employed to evaluate the coating adhesion. Three scratches were performed at progressive load under the test conditions. Observation of the surface damages by means of an optical microscope permitted to determine the critical load. No acoustic emission detections or frictional force fluctuations could be correlated with the optical observations. In this investigation, the critical load corresponds to the regular occurrence of delamination. Scanning electron microscopy provided the essential and detailed information about the mode of failure of the coatings along the scratch channel. It was found that the coatings presented high plastic deformation and cohesive fracture at values lower than the critical load, Lc.

Recent work has suggested that near-fully lamellar or fully-lamellar microstructures may provide attractive combinations of room and elevated temperature properties in near-gamma titanium aluminide alloys. The development of such microstructures via thermal processing high in the two-phase (alpha+gamma) field or in the single-phase (alpha) field is described. In particular, the interaction of the dissolution of gamma grains and the growth of alpha grains during isothermal and transient heat treatment processes will be summarized. Models for the kinetics of gamma grain dissolution and alpha grain growth will be presented. The broad application of such models for the design of heat treatments to obtain fully lamellar microstructures will be illustrated for several forged gamma components.

THE ORDERING TIE LINES AND TIE TRIANGLES IN TITANIUM ALUMINIDES:</B> D.-H. Hou, <I>H.L. Fraser</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210
<P>
The site occupancies of alloying elements in <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> TiAl and the ordering states in orthorhombic titanium aluminides are investigated using the newly developed Ordering Tie Line (OTL) analysis. The OTL, which can represent the atom configuration in an ordered alloy in a graphical and intuitive way, is a parameter that is unique to ordered alloys. There are two properties of an OTL, one being its slope, indicating the trend for sublattice occupancy, and the other the compositional endpoints, corresponding to the <I>compositions</I> of the individual sublattices. The slope can be determined conveniently by Atom Location by Channeling Enhanced Microanalysis (Alchemi) experiments, whereas the compositional endpoints may be determined either from additional information concerning the ordering scheme or determined by other experiments/simulations. In the present study, compositional endpoints are determined by simulation using the dynamical theory of electron diffraction. The OTL analysis which was originally developed for ternary compounds has been further extended to quaternary systems such as TiAl with two alloying elements and ternary system with three sublattice sites such as the orthorhombic alloys based on Ti2AlNb. For the TiAl alloys, the effect of alloying elements of Nb, Cr, Mo and Mn on the OTL are determined and discussed. For the orthorhombic alloy, it will be shown how the ordering state can be described by the Ordering Tie Triangle (OTT), and how to measure the OTT by the Alchemi experiments. Since the OTL can provide a direct measure of the ordering state, it will be an important parameter for alloy design. This work has been supported by the US ONR, Dr. George Yoder as Program Manager.

<P>
<P>It's found in the cast Ti-46.5Al-2.5V-1.0Cr (at%) ingot, that the discontinuous coarsening (DC) dominates the decomposition of the lamellar structure when annealing at temperatures lower than 1273K while the continuous coarsening (CC) does at the temperature between 1373K and 1473K. In the case of CC, the lamellae coarsened segmentally and then the FL microstructure decomposed to a finer equiaxed near gamma (NG) microstructure as annealing time went on. The TEM observation showed that the prior lamellae are quite neat and perfect and the annealed lamellae have inner terminations. Thus, the Rayleigh's perturbation and breakdown of lamellae was believed to have occurred along with the CC. Furthermore, a cycle heat treatment of 1173K-1423K has been designed to increase the density of the inner terminations of lamellae. After that, the FL microstructure has been decomposed to a more homogeneous and even finer equiaxed NG microstructure.

MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION DURING POSTWELD HEAT TREATMENT OF GAS TUNGSTEN-ARC AND ELECTRON BEAM WELDS IN CAST Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb ALLOY:</B> W.A. Baeslack III, C.M. Jensen, H. Zheng, Department of Industrial, Welding and Systems Engineering, Ohio State University , Columbus, OH 43210; T.J. Kelly, GE Aircraft Engines, 1 Neumann Way, Evendale, OH 45215
<P>
The microstructures of multi-pass gas tungsten-arc (GTA) welds produced in cast Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb (at.%) have been evaluated in the as-welded condition and following postweld heat treatment over a range of temperatures from 1000 to 1300&#176;C. Although postweld heat treatment did not significantly affect the cast, HIP'ed and heat-treated base metal microstructure, it did promote transformation of a predominantly lamellar <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> microstructure in the as-welded fusion zone, to microstructures comprised principally of equiaxed <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> grains. An increase in the heat treatment temperature resulted in an increased proportion of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 located principally at <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> grain boundaries and grain boundary triple points. These microstructural changes were associated with softening and toughening of the fusion zone, both of which increased with an increase in postweld heat treatment temperature. Featureless, hard bands (&gt;400 DPH as-welded) observed to parallel the fusion boundaries, which exhibited an extremely fine lamellar microstructure, were also softened by postweld heat treatment, although they remained harder than the surrounding weld metal microstructure.

INTERACTION BETWEEN TIAL AND ALN AT HIGH TEMPERATURES:</B> <I>Y. Paransky, </I>E.Y. Gutmanas, Department of Materials Engineering, Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel<P>
In this work, interfacial reactions between TiAl intermetallic and aluminum nitride have been studied in the 800-1200&#176;C temperature range. Titanium aluminides are developing as a new group of materials for high temperature applications. Their load bearing capacity can be considerably improved by introducing high strength ceramic fibers, such as SiC or boron. Due to the high reactivity of Ti-containing materials, chemical interaction between fibers and TiAl matrix takes place at the processing and/or service temperatures resulting in deterioration of mechanical properties. Fibers can be protected by a thin coating layer which dissolves slowly enough to prevent the matrix from attacking the fiber during the composite lifetime. AlN is a possible choice for such a coating in Ti-containing matrices. Interfacial reactions between AlN and TiAl matrix have been studied using the diffusion couple approach. Phases growing at the interface between TiAl and AlN have been identified by XRD, SEM/EDS, AES and TEM; the kinetics of reaction layer growth has also been investigated. It has been found that AlN is more stable in TiAl than in pure Ti. In the latter case, the dissolution of AlN is faster due to the higher activity of Ti and high diffusivity or nitrogen in Ti.

<P>RECYCLING OF MAGNESIUM ALLOY SCRAP, A NECESSITY:</B> Christine Brassard, <I>Lisabeth Riopelle, </I>Oddmund Wallevik, Hydro Magnesium Market Development Center, 21644 Melrose Avenue, Southfield, MT 48075-9705
<P>
<P>The use of magnesium alloys is growing rapidly, particularly in die cast parts for the automotive industry. Supporting this growth in the future means that Mg has to be an economically and ecologically attractive material, and recycling of alloy scrap becomes a necessity. What kinds of magnesium scrap will be on the market? What are the opportunities and challenges for this emerging recycling industry? Different recycling processes have been developed, and operation facilities are today recycling large volumes of class 1 diecast returns based on a flux refining technology. Characterization of the recovered metal demonstrates that the performance of appropriately recycled magnesium alloy is comparable to an alloy made from primary electrolytic metal. The sludge generated from this process can also be recycled through the existing primary Mg operations in order to close the environmental loop.

<P>The INMETCO Cadmium Recovery Facility currently processes commercial and industrial nickel/cadmium batteries at their Ellwood City, PA plant. The facility receives recycled nickel/cadmium batteries to recover cadmium shot product and nickel/iron scrap. The technology employed for the dismantling of industrial cells and the distillation of cadmium is under license from SAFT-NIFE in Sweden. In addition, INMETCO has installed a thermal pretreatment pilot unit for processing commercial and consumer cells which has recently demonstrated encouraging results. The INMETCO facility began detailed design in February 1995. The first cadmium distillation furnace was brought on-line December 1995, and the complete facility was operational April 1996. The facility can process 2450 short tons per year of industrial cells and 630 short tons per year of consumer cells. The facility design incorporated provisions for future expansion to allow INMETCO the ability to keep up with the forecasted growth of recycling nickel/cadmium batteries through the year 2000.

<P>
<P>Hitachi Refinery of Nippon Mining &amp; Metals Co., Ltd. installed a reverberatory type recycling furnace in 1978 in order to treat the industrial wastes which contain metal elements such as copper, gold and silver. Waste materials and pyrite such as galvanizing sludge, hydroxide slime and dust, are smelted together, and sulfidized copper, iron and precious metals are transformed into matte and other metallic elements are oxidized into slag. This copper matte is transported to Saganoseki smelter, and copper and precious metals are recovered. Recently it became difficult to get pyrite economically because of the decrease of pyrite production. Therefore, new treating process of the liquid waste has been investigated at Hitachi. In this process, the sulfide or sulfate from the liquid waste are smelted as the sulfur source instead of pyrite.

<P>
<P>This work is part of a major European research project on the re-use of packaging materials in their post consumer state. The first stage of the recovering of aluminum from a waste stream is to free the non-ferrous metals with an Eddy Current machine. Previous research has given excellent results on the separation of aluminum from pre-separated packaging material. At this moment there were two reasons for a new test series: In the Netherlands all cities are obliged to collect the organic waste separately from the other waste, thus leading to a rest fraction with a high potential on aluminum. The newest generation Eddy Currents work with a higher separation efficiency. This report will discuss the results of these test series. The recovered aluminum is used for remelting trials in another sub-project of this research programme.

<P>
<P>This work is part of a major European research project on the re-use of packaging materials in their post consumer state. Recovering aluminum from household refuse leads to a mix-up with other metals, e.g. copper and steel. The aluminum industry aims to make packaging materials from waste packagings. Therefore, a purification step is required during the remelting operation. This research is focused on the removal of excess iron from the melt. The technique used is the formation of intermetallic compounds of FeMn by adding Mn, followed by separating these intermetallics from the molten metal. Theoretical studies of the ternairy and quarternairy phase diagrams, using computer modeling, have predicted the possible limits of purification. After laboratory trials some large scale remelting experiments have been performed to study the applicability of this technique.

Metallurgical results of an oxidation process utilizing Thiobacillus ferroxidans have culminated in the design, construction and operation of a 780,000 ton bioxidation demonstration facility. The facility has processed 780,000 tons of refractory ore, using a batched process with separate pads for bioxidation and ammonium thiosulfate gold extraction. Siliceous sulfide refractory (SSR) and carbonaceous (CSR) ores are treated separately during biooxidation pretreatment unit operation. Procedures and results of grinding, agglomeration and pad biooxidation cycle (180 days) are followed by lime neutralization, and dumped on oxide leach pads, or stacked on the ammonium thiosulfate leach pad. Gold is leached with either cyanide for SSR ores or ammonium thiosulfate for preg-robbing CSR ores.

<P>
<P>Natural bioxidation of shallow, refractory ore heaps, relying on gaseous oxygen diffusion from the heap surface is attractive because of its simplicity and potential low cost, especially without using a lined pad, which is possible if percolation of leachate through the heap is avoided. In this case, the excess oxidation enthalpy must be removed by water evaporation from within the wet ore heap, and the rising water vapor flux within it will impede the downward oxygen flux. An analysis of this process shows that for typical values of pyrite grades and limited temperature increases. In the ore heap, the oxidation rate and penetration into the heap is reduced to values between about 30 percent and 50 percent of those obtained when leachate percolation occurs and water evaporation is not significant mechanism of heat removal.

ECONOMIC CRITERIA FOR CHOOSING BIOHEAP PRETREATMENT OF MIXED OXIDE/REFRACTORY GOLD ORE: </B><I>Robert W. Bartlett,</I> Univ. of Idaho, College of Mines &amp; Earth Resources, Moscow, ID 83844-3O25
<P>
<P>Bioheap pretreatment of sulfidic refractory gold ore prior to cyanide leaching is a promising new technology, especially for low-grade ores that cannot be oxidized by pressure leaching or roasting.<B> </B>Ores containing both refractory and amenable gold require economic decisions whether, or not, to pretreat before cyanide leaching. This choice is more complex than familiar ore/waste cut-off grade decisions. Pretreatment may increase recovery but delays receiving revenue. An equation has been developed that computes a &quot;critical cyanide leachable gold grade&quot; for determining whether pretreatment will be profitable. If the ore's actual cyanide leachable grade, without pretreatment, is above critical grade, pretreatment will not pay. The parameters in this equation are: waste/ore cut-off grade, pretreatment yield, total gold grade, pretreatment operating cost and project's financial discount rate. Calculations are provided for use in mine development planning when bioheap pretreatment is an available option.

It is now well known that even small angle grain boundaries (misorientation angle <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/theta.gif"> &frac34; 10) show drastic reduction in inter-grain critical current. Drawing upon on our previous work, we show that this reduction must be ascribed to the stress field in proximity of the dislocations forming the small angle boundary. The alternate view that the reduction is due to the presence of dislocation cores is investigated by calculating their size as a function of misorientation. We show that the concept though probably valid for large misorientation (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/theta.gif"> <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gtequalto.gif"> 10) leads to serious disagreement with experiments for small values (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/theta.gif"> &#190; 10).

Buffer layers that are structurally and chemically compatible with YBCO have been deposited on the metallic substrates with a biaxial texture similar to that of the substrate. Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) has been used for deposition of YBCO since this technique enables a high rate of deposition that is not limited by line-of-sight.

<P>
<P>A method to obtain long lengths of flexible, biaxially oriented substrates with smooth, chemically compatible surfaces for epitaxial growth of high temperature superconductors is reported. The technique uses well established, industrially scaleable, thermomechanical processes to impart a strong biaxial texture to a base metal like Ni. This is followed by vapor deposition of epitaxial buffer layers (metal and/or ceramic) to yield chemically compatible surfaces for HTS film deposition. Substrates prepared using this method are referred to as Rolling Assisted Biaxially Textured Substrates (RABITS). Epitaxial YBCO films grown using laser ablation on RABITS have critical current densities exceeding 7 x 105 A/cm2 at 77 K in zero-field and have field dependences similar to epitaxial films on single crystal ceramic substrates. The texture of the base metal has been achieved in lengths over 1 m and scaleable techniques are being pursued to deposit epitaxial multilayers. Deposited conductors made using this technique offer a potential route for the fabrication of long lengths of high Jc wire capable of carrying high currents in high magnetic fields and at elevated temperatures.

The structure and transport properties of grain boundaries in thin film and bulk bi-crystals of YBa2Cu3O7<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/partial.gif"> have been studied in detail. The thin film bi-crystals were prepared by sputter deposition onto SrTiO3 bi-crystal substrates while the bulk bi-crystals were prepared by a dual-seeded melt textured growth process. The structures of these two types of grain boundaries can be very different: thin film boundaries typically exhibit meandering and impurity phases that extend through the thickness of the film while the bulk boundaries tend to be very straight and relatively free of impurity phases.

<P>
Superconducting thick films are finding technological exploitation in various applications; for example as inductive components in power engineering designs such as fault current limiters, and as microwave devices like filters in cellular communications applications. For efficient performance in these different fields superconducting properties require optimisation with respect to different parameters such as critical current density (Jc) and surface resistance (Rs). The microstructural control to deliver these properties demands careful processing. Flux pinning additions, composition control, doping, and novel processings techniques have been employed to improve the characteristics of the films. Barrier layer technology to enable the exploitation of low dielectric loss and economically attractive alumina substrates has been studied. The relationship between processing, microstructure and superconducting behavior will be discussed.

For the light rare earth elements, the orthorhombic REBa2Cu3O7-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif"> structure forms not as a line compound but with varying degrees of RE+3 substitution on the Ba+2 sites and additional oxygen incorporated in the basal plane to balance charge. It has been demonstrated that for RE = Nd, Pr, (Nd + Pr), and (Nd + Gd), the occupation of RE on Ba sites is a function of the oxygen partial pressure (pO2) and temperature. Not only is the minimum value of x effected but for a fixed value of x, large changes in the superconducting transition are observed. By manipulating the pO2 and T profile, phase assemblage can be modified. Under proper processing conditions, these second phases can form pinning sites in these materials, resulting in enhanced high field critical currents.

THE EFFECT OF PROCESSING PARAMETERS ON Hg-1223 TAPE FABRICATION: </B><I>R. Meng</I>, Y.Wang, B. Hickey, K. Ross, Y. Xue, C.W. Chu, Texas Center for Superconductivity, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204-5932
<P>
We have developed a process to fabricate Hg-1223 tape on a metal substrate with a transition temperature of 130 K and a self-field critical current density of 2 x 104 A/cm2 at 77 K. However, the reproducibility of the tape is poor and weak links exist in the tape so prepared. We have therefore investigated the chemical stabilities, processing parameters, and Ni doping effect on the Hg-1223 phase formation and grain growth. We found that doping can suppress the volatility of Hg in Hg-1223 and speed up the growth of Hg-1223. While Ni was found to be better than the other metal substrates tested it failed to retain its integrity for prolonged exposure to the processing conditions. Only a slight amount of Ni can be incorporated into the Hg-1223 grain, and it usually enters the Cu sites leadiing to a slight suppression of Tc. Proper processing conditions to eliminate the diffusion of Ni to Hg-1223, while favoring the growth and alignment of the Hg-1223 tape, will be discussed.

An orthorhombic titanium aluminide alloy ingot with a nominal composition of Ti-22Al-26Nb (atom percent) has been produced and converted to 6&quot; diameter billet. A continuous cooling transformation diagram was generated using compression samples, and TEM performed to understand phase evolution during cooling. A series of melts were cut from the 6&quot; billet and either forged into pancakes or rolled into rings using a variety of process routes. The effects of process variables and final heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the pancakes and rings have been evaluated. Mechanical properties included tensile (room temperature to 1300&#176;F), creep (1000&#176; - 1200&#176;F), fracture toughness (room temperature) and fatigue (room temperature to 1200&#176;F).

<P>
The ordering behavior of the orthorhombic (O, Ti2AlNb, Cmcm) phase are presented. The presence of the O phase in two distinct forms with different site occupations is discussed. They are (1) the O1 phase Nb atoms occupying the Ti sublattice randomly and (2) the O2 phase with a specific sublattice for the Nb atoms. Both O1 and O2 exhibit the same space group and lattice periodicity and this makes their identification from one another a difficult task. We present in this paper, the various diffraction effects which arise due to the different ordering behavior of the O phase, for both X-ray and electron diffraction. Specific reflections are singled out. A definition of the order parameter and its experimental determination are presented. Possible transitions between the two forms are presented in the spirit of the Landau-Lifshitz theory for order-disorder transformations.

Both uncoated and coated fatigue samples of the alloy Ti-22Al-26Nb were subjected to elevated temperature exposures in air. Oxygen ingress and interdiffusion (and reaction) of elements between coating and substrate cause changes in both microstructure and properties (i.e., embrittlement). After exposure, the microstructures of the substrate, the reaction zone and the oxidation products were examined, and fatigue tests were conducted. The suitability of selected coatings for protection of orthorhombic alloys against property degradation from exposure at elevated temperatures will be discussed.

<P>The development of a Ti-based metal matrix composite (MMC) material, capable of sustained and repeated exposure to service temperatures in the range of 650-760&#176;C (1200-1400&#176;F), has been undertaken in a U.S. Air Force sponsored program. Several performance characteristics qualify as &quot;critical&quot; for specific turbine engine component applications and service environments. To define these component-critical MMC characteristics, we selected a turbine engine compressor rotor, in which transverse tensile and creep strengths were found to be critical issues. Improvements in MMC transverse tensile and creep strengths can be made by increasing the matrix properties through alloy chemistry modifications, as well as through microstructural manipulation. This program, and others, have examined, in a systematic way, the effects of elemental additions, such as Mo, Ta, Si, V, and O, on mechanical properties, environmental resistance, and processability of Ti-Al-Nb alloys.

Titanium aluminide alloys containing the ordered orthorhombic phase, based on Ti2AlNb, are considered as potential materials for the compressor section of aerospace engines both in their monolithic form and as matrices in metal matrix composites. The microstructure (volume fraction of the ordered alpha-2, B2 and orthorhombic phases, grain size, lath size and spacing) has a significant effect on the mechanical properties of these materials. In this study two heat treatments of the orthorhombic alloy Ti-22A1-23Nb resulting in a fully transformed and a duplex microstructure were investigated.

The phase evolution, room temperature tensile, and elevated temperature creep behaviors of Ti-25Al-25Nb and Ti-23Al-27Nb have been examined. A variety of microstructures, consisting of different volume fractions of B2 and O were achieved through deformation processing and heat treatments. Supertransus heat treated microstructures suffered from intergranular attack and exhibited low ductility. Subtransus heat treated microstructures exhibited a balance of RT tensile and elevated temperature creep performance. Creep samples showed evidence of microstructural instability, involving cellular/widmanstatten precipitation of O phase within the B2 grains. The kinetics of O phase precipitation at the creep temperature, 650&#176;C, and the effect of this instability on creep are presented. In addition, overall effects of microstructural features on tensile, creep, and damage accumulation are discussed.

Plasma Spray Forming is a upscaled version of droplet deposition method from the melt, which combines the steps of melting, rapid solidification, and consolidation into a single operation. The present paper critically reviews the versatility of this process which is successfully applied to the synthesis of Ti alloys and Ti- aluminide preforms for subsequent cold rolling into thin foils. These Plasma Sprayed preforms are transformed into dense wrought Ti-aluminide foils by a roll consolidation process. It has been observed that production of this dense foils are as continuous coil, which would improve process efficiency and yield high quality at low cost. Actually these high strength Ti alloys and Ti-aluminide foils are required for fabricating composite structures for advanced aerospace technology and space shuttles. In addition to it, various parameters are discussed which primarily includes designing of optimum interface, growth kinetics etc., and became necessary in enhancing service life of these foils at elevated temperatures.

Many binary systems exhibit miscibility gaps in the liquid state. It is well known that melts which are passing a miscibility gap on cooling, solidify to a regular consisting of two layers. Such metallic solid bodies are not interesting for technical applications and have also scarcely been investigated scientifically. Genuine interest in demixing systems only arised as it seemed possible to prevent layer formation under zero gravity. However, experiments in space have shown that even under migro-g conditions, phase separation is occurring, yet in another way as on earth and also not finely dispersed. Afterwards, there resulted an intensive disclosure of the thermodynamics and the kinetics of the separation of liquid immiscible phases. After the discussion of the results obtained it is indicated how layer formation can be prevented and a finely dispersed structure can be realized in order to enable technical use.

Stricter particulate emission regulations and the competitive requirements to produce metal as economically as possible are driving the non-ferrous processing industry to focus on cleaner and more efficient technologies. One area of interest is the air cleaning systems. Presently, there are many different air filtration technologies employed by the industry. Fabric filtration systems with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane filters are increasingly being chosen to provide optimum performance over conventional depth filtration. The selection of filtration technology greatly affects the performance of the baghouse and process. The ePTFE membrane surface filtration provides consistently higher airflow and longer filter life, while also providing the additional benefit of the lowest particulate emission of any fabric filtration media. Membrane filtration provides these benefits in concentrate drying, primary and secondary smelter and converter baghouses, with case histories around the world.

The structure-property relationships of C60 dissolved in decahydronaphtalene (decalin) and a petroleum solvent viscous standard (PSVS) were studied. This work was motivated mainly by the interest to improve fullerene dispersion in powder processing by wet methods. Measurements of solubility, density, viscosity and elasticity were conducted varying the concentration level of C60. A Decalin solution was mixed with Cu powder and the C60 dispersion and Cu grain-size growth were evaluated. Decalin can dissolve 1.9 mg/ml of C60 while the PSVS dissolves 0.15 mg/ml. The viscosity behavior shown by both solutions was Newtonian, with a small increase in viscosity as a function of fullerene concentration. The elastic portion of the solvents did not change with fullerene concentration. The samples prepared by wet methods showed less C60 agglomerates. This presentation will also emphasize the aspects of handling the fullerene powder in wet and dry methods. This work was supported by National Science Foundation DMR-9357505.

Poor flowability of cohesive powders is the source of frequent concern in powder handling in many industrial processes. Coating of fine particles on the surface of primary powder particles can be applied to improve powder flowability. In this paper, we examine quantitatively the effect of coating fine particles on the cohesion force between primary powder particles by extending the JKR theory to include the effect of coating particles on the force-displacement relationship. It is shown that the cohesion force between two primary powder particles in the presence of a fine coating particle is directly proportional to the size ratio of the coating particle to the primary powder particle resulting in a drastic reduction in the cohesion force. Through discrete element simulation of powder flows the improved flowability is demonstrated. The effect of coating on improving the flowability is also quantified by comparing the measured angles of repose at a static condition and the flow rates of the gravity driven flow through a funnel for powders with and without particle coating.

<P>A packing of particles is an assemblage of particles and is widely encountered in many industries. Porosity or packing density is known to be the simplest and most accessible parameter in characterising particle packing. It is very useful to develop a method for predicting the porosity and related packing properties of particulate mixtures for property and/or process control. Particle characteristics affect porosity mainly via three factors: (dimensionless) particle size distribution, particle shape and absolute particle size, giving various packing systems from the simple (coarse) spherical particle packing to the complicated system involving fine and non-spherical powders. Consequently, the modelling of the relationship between porosity and particle characteristics may be carried out by considering these three factors. This paper presents a mathematical model developed on the basis of some simple and physically sound concepts in this direction, with examples provided to confirm its applicability.

<P>Gas-powder-liquid multiphase-phase flow in packed beds can be found in many industrial applications. One typical example is the flow in the lower part of a modern ironmaking blast furnace with high pulverised coal injection, which includes an upward flow of gas and (unburnt) coal and downward flow of liquid iron and slag in a coke bed. Understanding the mechanisms governing the powder entrapment in packed particles is an important step toward the modelling of such a flow system. This paper presents a study of the mechanisms through a model experiment in which the form and volume of deposits, i.e. the entrapped powder, can be visualised. It is found that the contact point between particles plays an important role in capture of powder, and the presence of a liquid may significantly increase the powder entrapment and lead to a dramatic increase in gas pressure drop. The effects of variables relevant to the blast furnace process, such as liquid properties, gas, powder and liquid flowrates, and the size ratio between (flowing) powder and (packed) particle have been studied, and correlations have been formulated for modelling purposes.

The avalanching behavior of a portion of powder in a slowly rotating disc can be related to the flow behavior of powder in processing equipment. To interpret the observed avalanching behavior a new data processing procedure has been developed which permits instant visual recognition of shifts in the flow behavior. This can be caused by changes in powder grain structure; additives (such as glidants) and changes in ambient properties (such as humidity). Data on these four metal powders of different size, shape and texture will be presented.

<P>EXTRACTION OF RHENIUM FROM MOLYBDENITE CONCENTRATES:</B> Mahesh C. Jha, William A. May, Entech Molybdenum Inc., 5950 McIntyre Street, Golden, CO 80403-7499
<P>
<P>By-product molybdenite concentrates from copper mines are the most important source of rhenium. The rhenium content is low, generally in the few hundred ppm range. Almost all of these concentrates are roasted to technical grade molybdic oxide, the most common molybdenum product sold commercially. Rhenium oxide is volatilized at high roasting temperatures and condensed downstream at lower temperatures, eventually reporting to the scrubber liquor as a dilute solution. This paper reviews several hydrometallurgical approaches that have been used commercially and for researched and recommended to recover the rhenium from such dilute solutions. The methods include ion exchange, solvent extraction, selective leaching/precipitation, and crystallization for concentration and purification steps. Ammonium perrhenate is typically the end product.

The aim of the investigation is the generalization of the published results according of rhenium extraction from secondary materials. Such materials can be classified as binary W-Re and Mo-Re alloys; several composition Ni-Re alloys; Al-Pt-Re catalysts and other Re-containing secondary products. The range of technological processes is very mice and depends on forms and Re concentration in secondary materials. For Re extraction from binary alloys can be used processes including interaction with KNO3 or oxidation. In the last case it may be obtained volatile Re207. Purification can be done by rectification Re2O7. The full extent of Re extraction from such materials is 92-94%. Combination of the chlorination process with solvent extraction allows to obtain Re metal with extent of extraction ~92%. Re can be obtained from Mo-Re, W-Re alloys by means of electrochemical process (alkali solutions) or H:SO. solutions (Ni-Re alloys). For the production of the pure Re products it's necessery to use combination with solvent extraction or sorbtion. Complex Re and Pt extraction metals from A1-Pt-Re containing catalyst is the most important problem. There are known two methods, which differ at the first step: annealing with Na2CO3 or annealing in oxidation atmosphere are possible. Extents of Re and Pt extraction are 90 and 92%.

The definite works to create scientific foundations and the technology for the recovery of rhenium from the primary and secondary raw materials were initiated in the 60's at the Chairs of the rare-earth metals &amp; powder metallurgy led by the Distinguished Metallurgist of Russia, professor A. N. Zelikman. 1. The molybdenum concentrates- one of the prime sources to recover rhenium along with the sulfide copper and copper/moly raw materials. The researches have been tested to investigate a behavior of rhenium during roasting process of the molybdenum concentrates and during the attack by the nitrogen acid. 2. The researchers have been tested with form and mechanism of extraction of molybdenum and rhenium from sulfur acid and nitrogen/sulfur acid solutions of different compositions. During the elaborations of the extraction methods of distribution and the recovery it has been taken into account the differences in the forms of molybdenum and rhenium presence in the acid atmospheres and it has been suggested to utilize the neutral, anion- and cation exchange extragents. 3. The processes of the deep cleaning of the rhenium combination through trihydroxychloride, having the below melting and flashing temperature have been developed. The purity of the recovered ammonium perrhenate and metallic rhenium is exceeding their purity during the production and refinery by the other methods. 4. Some methods have been tested to regenerate rhenium, tungsten, molybdenum from the wastes of W-Re &amp; Mo-Re alloys with further treatment of the mixtures of chlorides of tungsten and rhenium by the water with the presence of oxidant and oxidation of alloys by means of oxygene and sublimation of rhenium oxide.

<P>
<P>This study presents results of texture and microstructural development in AlLi 2195 alloy processed by near-net-shape roll forging method. The manufacturing technique is a multistage process that combines conventional ingot conversion, back extrusion, and ring rolling to produce a heavy walled cylindrical forging preform. The preform is then rolled to nearfinal diameter using contoured rolling mandrels. A combination of optical microscopy, Orientation Distribution Function (ODF) and Orientation Imaging Microscopy (O1M) was used in this investigation. At the early stage of processing, (110) fiber texture was predominant. Following the second stage of processing, the texture was similar to characteristic fcc rolling texture. At the conclusion of processing, {001}&lt;110&gt; and {112}&lt;110&gt; shear components were developed at the expense of Brass ! component. The possible mechanisms responsible for the texture changes are discussed in relation with the microstructural evolution.

Amorphous aluminum alloys show an attractive combination of high tensile strength and low density. The commercial applications of these alloys, however, have been restricted due to relatively poor thermal stability and glass forming ability (GFA). The GFA and the thermal stability of Al86Mn4Ni10-xFex alloys have been investigated with various alloy composition. Amorphous ribbons with the thickness from 20pm to 30&#181;m were prepared by single roll melt-spinner. The microstructural evolution upon heating was observed by using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The GFA of the present alloys decreased with the increase of Fe content. However, the first (lowest) crystallization temperature, Txl, increased with increasing Fe content. The effects of alloy composition on the GFA and the thermal stability will be discussed in terms of the atomic bonding and electronic structure of the amorphous alloy.

The Al-Cu-Li (2195) alloy was stretched uniaxially from 0% to 15% of plastic deformation prior to aging. The tensile properties of naturally and artificially aged specimens in 0, 45, and 90 degrees with respect to the pre-stretching direction were evaluated and their microstructures were characterized via TEM. The results indicated that the naturally aged specimen exhibited mainly <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif">' (Al3Li) precipitates whose size appeared to be insensitive to pre-stretching. The moderate increase in yield strength by prestretching was attributed to work hardening effect. On the other hand, it was found that the precipitates of the artificially aged (at 180&#176;C) specimen were primarily T1 (Al2CuLi) phase. The size of the T1 precipitates decreased with increasing amount of pre-stretching. A pronounced increase in yield strength by pre-stretching was observed with the presence of fine T1 precipitates. The relationship between mechanical properties and microstructures will be discussed.

The use of Al-Cu-Li-Ag-Mg-Zr alloys for fabricating aerospace vehicle components can potentially reduce system weight. For damage tolerant analysis, it is important to characterize and understand alloy strength and fracture toughness, particularly as affected by minor changes in composition and test temperature. The uniaxial tensile deformation, plane strain fracture toughness, and plane stress tearing resistance of two precipitation hardened alloys, AA2095 and AA2195, were examined as a function of Cu and Li levels and temperature from -185&#176;C to 135&#176;C. As temperatures decreased, the crack initiation toughness of AA2095 declined mildly while the toughness of AA2195 increased mildly. Alloy AA2195 demonstrated superior toughness in all cases. For each alloy the elastic modulus, yield strength and work hardening coefficient increased with decreasing temperature, while ductility declined from 135&#176;C to -185&#176;C. A plastic strain-critical distance-based micromechanical model utilized these properties to predict that KICI increased mildly with declining temperature for each alloy. The slope of this trend was in good agreement with measurements for AA2195, but less so far AA2095. In all cases fracture occurred without delamination and by microvoid nucleation, growth and coalescence involving second phase particles which were particularly large in the higher Cu/Li variant (AA2095). This difference, along with separate relationships between nearest-neighbor particle spacing and the critical microstructural distance from the model explain the higher toughness of AA2195.

The effect of Be addition on the precipitation and mechanical properties of Al-Cu-Li-Mg-(Ag)-Zr alloys has been investigated by detailed transmission electron microscopy and hardness and tensile tests. It has been shown that the Be addition accelerates the aging response and improves the ductility while maintaining the strength of Al-Cu-Li-Mg-(Ag)-Zr alloys. Such improvements in mechanical properties are due to changes in precipitation behavior of Al-Cu-Li-Mg-(Ag)-Zr alloys by Be addition.

With the advent of new analytical tools to study microstructures and microtexture, it is now necessary to re-characterize materials with complex structures. Using Orientation Imaging Microscopy (OIM), several microstructural parameters were obtained for superplastic Al-Li 8090 alloy deformed in tension. Grain orientation and distribution as well as the effective grain size based on standard definition of large angle grain boundaries were determined as a function of strain. The data was correlated with various models for superplasticity. The implications of the results on the deformation mechanisms operating during superplastic deformation is discussed.

Deformation microstructures of an aluminum-lithium AA8090 SPF grade sheet have been studied by TEM. The alloy was deformed in tension at the superplastic deformation temperature of 530&#176;C and at a strain rate of 1x10-3/sec. The tensile testing machine was fitted with a specially designed in-situ water quenching apparatus to preserve the deformation microstructure produced at the temperature of testing. The TEM thin foils were made from samples deformed and in-situ quenched from different strain levels. Most of the thin foils were prepared with the surface parallel to the through thickness cross-section of the sheet, rather than parallel to the rolling plane. Dislocation pairs and dislocation networks were observed in the deformed samples even when deformation was as large as 475%. The observed characteristics of dislocation configuration suggest that dislocation interactions take place during superplastic deformation, in which grain boundary sliding is considered to play a dominant role and the role of dislocations is mainly to accommodate grain boundary sliding. In this paper, the possible implications of dislocation interactions and the mechanism of superplastic deformation in aluminum-lithium alloy AA8090 are discussed. <P>

<P>
The paper presents a mechanistic approach to modeling creep degeneration of superalloy components with a view to developing residual life prediction algorithms. In accordance with the deformation decomposition rule: E = Eg + Egbs, we classify degeneration mechanisms into two categories: 1) grain boundary deformation controlled degeneration mechanisms, including grain boundary sliding (GBS), cavitation and GBS assisted oxidation; and 2) intragranular deformation controlled degeneration mechanisms. The evolutionary creep equation for each strain component is thus mechanism-based. Generally, GBS is responsible for the transient, while intragranular deformation mechanisms, particularly dislocation glide-plus-climb and dislocation multiplication, contribute to tertiary creep deformation during short term tests. When coupled with cavitation and oxidation, GBS also contributes to tertiary creep. The total creep strain is a result of the summation of all above contributions, and the entire creep, as a continuous process, is thus described. Superimposed on these mechanisms are various fracture criteria to predict the eventual event of creep rupture.

<P>
The defect propensity in single crystal castings is enhanced with increased casting size. As the industrial gas turbine community moves towards the application of large single crystal castings, there is increasing concern regarding the effects of grain and casting defects on part life. Although aircraft engine experience provides a basis for single crystal grain limits, the cycle and life requirements of large industrial gas turbines differ considerably. The effect of several types of defects on the low cycle fatigue behavior of an advanced single crystal alloy will be discussed. Tests were run on cast-to-size LCF bars with intentional defects (freckles, inclusions, low angle boundaries, recrystallized grains, slivers, mis-oriented grains) in the gage section. A correlation between defect size and LCF life was observed. Work to date indicates LCF life is more dependent on defect size than type.

<P>
High temperature deformation processing of Ni base single crystal superalloy CMSX-6 has been shown to be a feasible process. However, it is essential that the single crystal material be deformed at a low strain rate and within an appropriate temperature range to prevent recrystallization and fracture. In order to establish these limits, the hot forming behavior of Ni base single crystal superalloy CMSX-6 was investigated by performing high temperature compression, bending, and rolling tests. Stepwise deformation and annealing tests were also conducted to simulate multi-pass rolling practice. The flow stress and recrystallization behavior were characterized over a range of temperatures, strain rates, and strains. Metallurgical phenomena, such as changes in size and morphology of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1 particles, orientation change of the single crystal specimens, subgrain boundary formation, recovery, and recrystallization, occurred during the high temperature deformation processes. These phenomena were analyzed to understand their influence on forming of single crystals. Deformation at too high temperatures resulted growth of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1 particles and deteriorated the service properties of single crystals. Highly mis-oriented subgrain formation around <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1 particles lead to recrystallization. Deformation mechanisms were investigated by analyzing the results of compression and indentation tests. The primary slip systems activated were of (111)&lt;110&gt; type.

The high temperature, age hardenable, Ni-Mo-Cr alloy HAYNES 242 shows a change in deformation characteristics dependent upon the testing temperature. Aged material shows microtwinning to be a dominant deformation mechanism at all testing temperatures. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of slip at room temperature and elevated temperature. Grain boundaries also seem to play a role in the fracture propagation mechanism at work in tested samples. Samples in the aged condition fracture with a combined mode of dimple rupture and cleavage as opposed to annealed samples which fracture through a dimple rupture mode alone. The fracture surface shows microvoid coalescence but the fracture takes place in a shear-type mode as opposed to the traditional cup and cone ductile fracture.

The erosion behavior of commercially available iron, nickel and cobalt-based alloys was evaluated and a relative ranking of their erosion resistance was developed. Microhardness tests were conducted in the vicinity of the eroded surface to measure the size of the plastic zone beneath the eroded surface. It was found that all alloys deformed plastically and a new toughness parameter has been proposed which shows good correlation with erosion resistance. To find a relationship between mechanical properties and erosion resistance, elevated temperature mechanical test were conducted for all alloys. The erosion resistance of tested materials exhibited good correlation with their tensile toughness. Relationships between the ability of materials to deform plastically, mechanical properties (i.e., hardness and tensile properties) and erosion resistance are discussed.

Thermal barrier coating (TBC) consisting of Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 top coat on a MCrAlY bond coat has been developed for thermal protection of hot components used in steel plant, especially the tuyeres in blast furnace. Since the tuyere is used under extremely harsh chemical environment and high temperature (up to 2300&#176;C) within the blast furnace, it is essential to develop a strong and tough protective coating, that is fully compatible to the tuyere's pure copper substrate, by applying the detonation-gun thermal spray method. As fuel gas amount increased, the porosity of MCrAlY coat layer generally decreased to less than 1%, but microcracks can be formed with extreme fuel gas amount. The metallic bond coat with the thickness greater than 100 &#181;m is required to sustain the ceramic top coat. In obtaining the best top coat, the spraying condition with maximum detonation temperature was found as an optimum condition from the computer simulation. A partially stabilized zirconia top coat layer deposited by this condition exhibited the low porosity with high hardness (~640 DPH) which is better than the coating made by plasma spraying. The thermal fatigue resistance of the present TBC was revealed to depend on both the thickness of ceramic top coat and the composition of the stabilizer. The result on the thermal conductivity is also discussed.

Many potential applications of electron beam evaporation demand tight compositional control in the deposits and high deposition rates. Adding tungsten to nickel-based evaporation pools can increase evaporation rates and improve compositional control in deposits. Effects of tungsten addition on several alloys, NiCoAl, NiCoCr, and NiCrAl were investigated. Magnitudes of compositional gradients in the deposits, measured using electron microprobe techniques, were used to evaluate the sensitivity of vapor cloud chemistry to fluctuations in processing parameters. Compositional and microstructural gradients in quenched evaporation pools, studied using microprobe and SEM, yielded information about the evolution of steady state in the pools. Tungsten distributions in the pools, which may significantly affect temperature distribution, fluid flow, and heat transfer, were mapped using back scattered electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Currently, pool surface temperatures are being mapped using an infrared imaging radiometer and effects of refractory additives other than tungsten are being evaluated.

Different approaches for synthesizing composite films include sputtering from elemental or compound targets, reactive sputtering, and direct sputtering of composite targets. This paper will explore the feasibility of synthesizing composite films by RF magnetron sputtering of a composite target. Results of compositional depth profiling using Auger Electron Spectroscopy, microstructural evaluation and X-Ray diffraction analyses of the films will be presented. In particular, the diffusion of silicon and carbon in to the substrate will be characterized using a &quot;ball-cratering&quot; technique followed by auger electron spectroscopy (AES). This technique will help to overcome the disadvantages associated with ion-beam sputtering during depth profiling (e.g. different sputter yields for the constituent elements, interface broadening effects, etc.).

<P>A current pre-conceptual design for the National Spallation Neutron Source (NSNS) considers the target to be flowing liquid mercury contained within a double-walled 316 stainless steel vessel. Calculations are underway to determine the neutron flux and to estimate the rates at which displacements, helium, and hydrogen are produced. The primary computational tools are MCNP, SPECTER, HETC, and LAHET. The displacement and helium production rates range up to about 10-7 DPA/s and 10-6 appm He/s due to the spectrum of neutrons produced by a 1700 MeV proton beam. The variation of calculated damage rates throughout the target region of NSNS is described and discussed.

<P>Foils of pure Cu, Co, Fe and Ni were irradiated in the second inboard tube of the rabbit system adjacent to the beam stop of the LANSCE facility. After irradiation, the foils were cut in half to determine neutron fluence and spectra via measurement of gamma activation, and to measure helium generation via isotopic dilution mass spectroscopy. The measured helium concentrations were 0.110, 0.152, 0.122 and 0.097 appm for Fe, Ni, Cu, and Co, respectively. The dpa level calculated for copper was 0.011 dpa, yielding a value of 11.1 appm/dpa.

<P>
<P>The latest release of the medium-energy Monte Carlo transport code LAHET includes a new nucleon-nucleus elastic scattering treatment based on an interim global medium-energy phenomenological optical-model potential. Implementation of the model in LAHET allows nuclear elastic scattering for neutrons with energies greater than 15 MeV and for protons with energies greater than 50 MeV. Previous investigations on the impact of the new elastic scattering model revealed that the addition of the proton elastic scattering channel can lead to a significant increase in the calculated damage energy. We report here results of further investigations on the impact of the new elastic scattering model on calculated damage cross sections and recoil spectra for materials and particle energies prototypic of spallation target environments. With the new elastic scattering treatment, the damage cross section for 20-MeV neutrons on light nuclei (A &lt; 30) as calculated by LAHET is in much better agreement with SPECTER calculations, where significant discrepancies have previously been observed.

<P>THE INFLUENCE OF SUBCASCADE FORMATION ON DISPLACEMENT DAMAGE AT HIGH PKA ENERGIES:</B> <I>R.E. Stoller</I>, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6376
<P>
<P>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of displacement cascades have been extended to energies as high as 40 keV. These simulations are the highest energy cascades completed to date and they provide valuable insight on the formation of primary damage in irradiated materials. An MD simulation at 40 keV is equivalent to a PKA energy of 61 keV, which is the average PKA energy from a neutron with an energy of 1.8 MeV. Although peak neutron energies in a spallation neutron source will be much higher than 1.8 MeV, the degree of subcascade formation observed at MD energies above 20 keV suggests that little change in the primary damage state will be observed for higher energies. This implies that fission reactor data should provide a good simulation of the displacement damage observed in a spallation neutron source. Thus, the effect of transmutation products is likely to be the most important difference between the two irradiation environments.

<P>
<P>Specimens of 1100 aluminum were exposed to several fluences of 23.5-GeV protons at the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron. Although this energy is above those currently being proposed for spallation neutron applications, the results can be viewed as indicative of trends and other microstructural evolution with fluence that take place with high-energy proton exposures such as those associated with an increasing ratio of gas generation to dpa. TEM investigation showed significantly larger bubble size and lower density of bubbles compared with lower-energy proton results. Estimates of H and He gas generation made using Monte Carlo are also used in this comparison. Additional testing showed that the tensile strength increased with fluence as expected, but the microhardness decreased, a result for which an interpretation is still under investigation.

<P>
<P>An evaluation of proton and neutron damage to various materials has been performed. The proton studies were conducted at energies of 0.2, 0.8, and 23.5 GeV and consisted of evaluation of proton-irradiated window/target materials from accelerators. The materials evaluated for the proton irradiations included high-purity (6 9's), 1100, and 5052 aluminum, 304 stainless steel, and inconel 718. The neutron damage research centered on 6061 T-6 aluminum from a control rod follower from the BNL HFBR, which received thermal fluence up to ~4 x 1023 n/cm2. The effects of thermal-to-fast neutron flux ratios are discussed. The increases in tensile strength in the proton-irradiated materials are shown to be due to atomic displacements, resulting in radiation hardening. Production of helium in the grain boundaries of proton-irradiated 6 9's aluminum is also discussed. The major factor contributing to the mechanical-property changes in the neutron-irradiated 6061 aluminum is transmutation products formed by interactions with thermal neutrons.

<P>Separation of the solder fillet from the circuit board pad along the solder-intermetallic interface has been observed for a wide range of lead-free solder alloys. The tendency for such separation depends on a number of factors, including solder composition, the freezing range (also known as the pasty range), the mechanical properties of the solder, and the interfacial toughness. The processes leading to fillet-lifting will be described and the potential for eliminating this problem in lead-free alloys will be discussed.

<P>HIGH TEMPERATURE FATIGUE RESISTANT SOLDER - A NCMS PROJECT:</B> <I>Duane Napp</I>, NCMS, 3025 Boardwalk, Ann Arbor, MI 48108-3266
<P> <P>To address the critical issue of placing electronic assemblies in extreme temperature environments that exceed the operating temperatures of commonly used eutectic Sn-Pb solder or high-Pb content alloys, National Center for Manufacturing Sciences (NCMS) initiated a national consortium in 1996 titled &quot;High Temperature Fatigue Resistant Solder Project&quot;. The project objective is to demonstrate and deploy the technology to substantially improve the performance of solder joints at elevated temperatures under thermal cycling conditions. Two types of solder are to be developed: one with a performance objective of up to 160C, &quot;Alloy 160&quot;, for organic substrate; and a second alloy with a performance objective of 205C, &quot;Alloy 205&quot;, for ceramic substrate, copper die bonding substrates, and hybrid technology. The goal is to demonstrate a thermal fatigue resistance that, in the respective temperature ranges, is equal to or better than that of conventional solders. The need for these new alloys is being driven by the automotive, telecommunications, avionics, and military industries. The project is organized into four task groups with five phases of work, and extends over a period of 33 months. The participants include automotive and military companies, solder suppliers, academic institutions, and national laboratories.

<P>
<P>Tape automated bonding (TAB) technology has been widely used in low-cost consumer products as well as in high-performance multichip modules. TAB technology facilitates the chip-on-board (COB) assembly scheme in most applications. In this talk, two key issues of TAB technology, wafer bumping and inner lead bonding, are reviewed in conjunction with COB applications. Bumping refers to the process of adding raised metal contacts to bond pads in order to provide both the necessary bonding metallurgy for chip-to-lead bonding and a physical standoff to prevent lead-chip shorting. This is done on a wafer or on a TAB tape. Various bumping processes in use are discussed in terms of bump materials/processing, structure, geometry, bump properties and behavior during bonding.

<P>
<P>A new Monte Carlo procedure for atomistically simulating physical vapor deposition processes is developed and used to model the two-dimensional physical vapor deposition of the step coverage of copper. The method consists of an implant approximation for the initial adatom adsorption on a surface and a multipath diffusion analysis to simulate subsequent surface morphology and interior atomic structure evolution. An embedded atom method is used to determine the activation energies for each of the many available diffusion paths. The method has been used to predict the morphology/structure evolution of copper films over the length and time scales encountered in practical deposition processes. The modeling approach has enabled determination of the effect of vapor processing variables such as flux orientation, deposition rate, substrate temperature, kinetic energy and aspect ratio on deposit morphology/microstructure and step coverage behavior.

<P>
<P>The adhesion strength of a metal film on a substrate is usually measured by the Peel Test. This test is not a direct measure of the interfacial energy because of the severe plastic deformation of the metal film accompanying the test. In the present analysis, using the Cu/Cr/polyimide system, the surface energy was deduced from the peel strength measurements and corresponding elasto-plastic analysis of the peel test. The metal/polyimide interface energy was varied by changing the pretreatment condition of the polyimide surface in Ar(+) RF plasma, and the adhered film thickness and yield stress were varied by changing the electroplating conditions. After the peel test, the chemistry of the Cr/polyimide interfaces were studied by AES and XPS.X-ray measurements of the residual strain in the peeled films were very useful in estimating the plastic work expenditure accompanying peeling. Results indicate that the deduced interfacial fracture energy is usually much smaller than the peel strength and is influenced by the RF pretreatment, but the interfacial energy is independent of the mechanical properties of the metal film, as expected.

<P>DAMAGE TOLERANCE IN BRITTLE MATERIALS:</B> R.O. Ritchie, Department of Materials Science and Mineral Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720

<P>A critical factor in the design of advanced materials for structural application is the development of sufficient damage tolerance, i.e., resistance to fracture and subcritical crack growth in the presence of pre-existing flaws. In practical terms, this implies designing microstructures with adequate fracture toughness based on toughening mechanisms that are resilient to cyclic loading, and where appropriate elevated temperatures and adverse environments. In this presentation, such considerations will be reviewed for a number of &quot;low ductility&quot; advanced materials, including ceramics (Si3N4, SiC) and intermetallics (g-TiAl, MoSi2, Nb3Al) in the form of monolithic, composite and layered materials.

<P>
Intermetallic-bonded ceramic (IBC) composites with various amounts of a WC or TiC carbide phase mixed with a Ni3Al or FeAl binder phase were successfully fabricated by liquid phase sintering and hot isostatic compaction methods. The influence of carbide type, binder type, and binder content on the flexural strength, hardness, fracture toughness, and corrosion resistance of IBC composites was investigated. Experimental techniques used to characterize the mechanical behavior included Vickers hardness, four-point flexure at 25 and 800&#176;C, indentation fracture, indentation strength, and mass loss corrosion testing. In addition, the microstructure was characterized using optical and scanning electron microscopy to examine the polished and etched microstructures, the cracks located at the corners of the hardness indents, and the fracture surfaces produced by flexure testing. Correlations were made between the mechanical properties of flexural strength and hardness and the microstructural parameter of contiguity. Experimental results indicate that the strength of IBC composites with Ni3Al at 800&#176;C compares favorably to the room-temperature strength. At 25&#176;C, plastic deformation of the Ni3Al and FeAl binders occurs, but the strength of the composite with FeAl is higher due to strong bonding along the carbide-binder interfaces. WC-based composites yielded higher flexural strength and fracture toughness values, while TiC-based composites produced higher hardness values. Increased binder amounts produced higher values of flexural strength and fracture toughness due to a reduction in the number of carbide-carbide interfaces and an increase in plastic deformation in the crack-tip region, respectively.

Intermetallic cells formed during reactive wetting of metal substrates often lead to a microcellular interface morphology. Evidence is given of interfacial sliding as the crack grows, along these interface, subcritically at very low strain energy release rates under cyclic loading. Physical model was constructed to capture the salient aspects of the interfacial sliding mechanism. The model predicted that the crack shielding should arise from interfacial sliding and the magnitude of the crack shielding depended on loading-mode, roughness of the interface, and sliding resistance of the interface. Experiments designed to test the validity of the model will be described and comparisons will be made between model predictions and experimental results.

Micromechanical models are also presented for the prediction of toughening in gamma alloys. The paper shows clearly that crack-tip shielding mechanisms do not necessarily result in slower fatigue crack growth rates.

SHEAR LIGAMENT TOUGHENING AND MICROMECHANICAL MODELLING IN IRON ALUMINIDE INTERMETALLICS:</B> Scott X. Mao, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada T2N 1N4
<P>
The fracture behavior of an iron aluminide intermetallica in air environment was studied. At room temperature, round tensile specimens were tested at different strain rates. By carefully examining the lateral surface of the tensile specimens, ligament-like structures that connected between microcracks were found. SEM pictures show that these structures, which can be called shear ligments, undergo ductile fracture by shearing. This type of fracture dissipates more energy and was believed to enhance the fracture toughness of the material. By use of a micromechanical model of shear ligment toughening, fracture toughness of the material, K, was estimated at different strain rate. The values of critical parameters, which are ligment length, area fraction and work to fracture by shear were obtained from SEM observations on different tensile specimens. K was found to be decreased towards lower strain rates. This strain rate effect was similar to that obtained experimentally. This outcome verified the importance of shear ligments in determining the materials fracture toughness.

The micromechanisms of crack-tip deformation will be elucidated for zirconia toughened nickel aluminide and molybdenum disilicide intermetallic composites reinforced with partially stabilized zirconia particles with different particle sizes. The transformation toughening components associated with different stabilizers (ceria, magnisia and yttria) are also quantified using micromechanics models and experimental results obtained from laser Raman spectroscopy and optical interference analyses. Shielding contributions from other applicable toughening mechanisms are also discussed. Stable fatigue crack growth in zirconia toughened intermetallics is attributed to the effects of kinematic irreversibility due to stress-induced martensitic transformations under cyclic loading. The relative contributions from microcracking and slip phenomena (to kinematic irreversibility) are also discussed.

A TWO-LIQUID SLAG MIXING EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE FOR STUDYING THE OXIDATIVE PRE-FUMING TREATMENT OF LEAD BLAST FURNACE SLAG:</B> Adrian Deneys, David Robertson, and Nick Schupp Center for Pyrometallurgy, University of Missouri-Rolla Rolla, MO 65401
<P>
An experimental technique has been devised for studying the reaction kinetics of the homogeneous, liquid phase reaction: ZnO+FeO = Zn(g)+Fe203, by which zinc evolution can occur from a molten Al203-CaO-FeO-Fe203-SiO2-ZnO bath in the absence of a carbonaceous reductant. When studying the reaction kinetics by heating from room temperature, solid state reactions and poorly defined melting points may obscure the starting point of the reaction. In order to eliminate this problem, an experimental technique was devised whereby two molten slags could be melted independently, and then mixed, to provide a well defined starting point from which to begin taking measurements. Two crucibles were mounted in a vertical reaction cylinder. The upper, mild steel, crucible had a bottom pouring plug which was sealed by a steel stopper rod. A fayalite mixture was contained in this crucible. The lower crucible contained an Al203-CaO-SiO2-ZnO mixture. Once the two slags had been melted, the steel stopper rod was removed from the upper crucible. The upper, reduced slag (fayalite in equilibrium with the upper steel crucible), drained into the lower crucible where the two slags were mixed by submerged argon stirring. Dip samples were taken to measure the zinc content of the final mixture as a function of time. The experimental procedure will be described, as well as results of experiments which were conducted on synthetic slags. The system investigated was similar to the lead blast furnace slag which is produced by the primary lead smelters of Missouri, USA.

QUENCH DROSSING OF LEAD BULLION:</B>: <I>Funsho K. Ojebuoboh</I>, Asarco Inc., Technical Services Center, 3422 South 700 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84119
<P>
New technology has been developed for drossing lead bullion. The technique was developed to replace conventional copper drossing, so-called rough crossing, performed in kettles. With quench drossing, water granulation of bullion exiting the smelting furnace, usually above 900&#176;C (1700&#176;F), is used to arrest equilibrium formation of the dross species. The process is based on granulating lead bullion from the furnace, thereby quenching the bullion, and subsequently sweating lead off the granules in a rotary kiln furnace. The major benefit of the new technology is expected to be reduced air-borne lead which is normally associated with conventional drossing. The process also has the potential of making lead crossing metallurgy more susceptible to better process control. The process and its development are described.

<P>
The use of magnesium alloys is growing rapidly, particularly in die cast parts for the automotive industry. Supporting this growth in the future means that Mg has to be an economically and ecologically attractive material, and recycling of alloy scrap becomes a necessity. What kinds of magnesium scrap will be on the market? What are the opportunities and challenges for this emerging recycling industry? Different recycling processes have been developed, and operation facilities are today recycling large volumes of class 1 diecast returns based on a flux refining technology. Characterization of the recovered metal demonstrates that the performance of appropriately recycled magnesium alloy is comparable to an alloy made from primary electrolytic metal. The sludge generated from this process can also be recycled through the existing primary Mg operations in order to close the environmental loop.

Technology developed and first implemented in the United Kingdom enables very low grade non ferrous scraps containing sils, organics, plastics and ferrous metals to be directly charged, without pretreatment, into a unique melting furnace. Two furnaces have been in full scale production for over four and two years, respectively. A third furnace was only recently commissioned. The oxy-fuel-based furnace design incorporates internal afterburning in the furnace's hot zone, producing excellent thermal efficiency and very low emissions. Advanced process control insures complete combustion of all volatiles in an environment that is not oxidizing to the melt. Thus metal yields have been excellent. The furnace is very low in Nox. This paper will provide both theoretical background and extensive operating results for this new melting concept. Applications describing both purpose built new furnaces and retrofits of existing reverberatory furnaces will be presented. Extensive operating emissions data will be presented.

A method of retrofitting air-fuel burners with oxy-fuel capability overcomes the potential problems associated with oxygen combustion in aluminum melting furnaces. Several years of operation in rotary furnaces reclaiming dross and UBC scrap and since 1993 in revereratory furnaces prove the usefulness of the retrofit approach. The retrofit burner uses the existing combustion air connection, burner housing, and burner tile and replaces the gas tube with an oxy-gas burner. Maintaining a portion of the air flow to the burner reduces the potential for localized overheating. This technique optimizes the mix of air and oxygen to the burner for the given furnace geometry and meltrate desired. Proper design of the burner reduces Nox emissions by moderating the flame temperature with furnace gas recirculation. Economic analysis of using merchant oxygen shows the benefits are increased productivity and reduced overall unit cost of melting. In practice, the melt rate in rotary furnaces increases by up to 50% and by up to 35% in reverberatory furnaces. Oxygen enhancement reduces melting cost by 1/2&#173;3/4 cents per pound of aluminum melted.

The reduction behavior of hamatite by H2 and H2-CO gas mixtures was investigated to elucidate the reduction mechanism at 1073~1223K. The hetatite compacts were made by Cold Isostatic Pressing to produce compacts of uniform shape and size. The compacts were sintered at 1273K for 30 min., and showed a contraction of 29%. Mercury pressure porosimeter and BET technique were used for measuring the total porosity, pore size distribution and pore surface area of the compacts. Reduction was followed up by means of weight-loss technique using Cahn Balance (Model: TG-171, capacity 10g, accuracy &#177; 10 &#181;g.) Microscopic examination (SEM, EPMA), X-ray, and carbon analysis were used to correlate the structure of reduced compacts with the mechanisms of reduction and carbon deposition. The values of apparent activation energy for H2 reduction were between 11.21 kcal/mol and 14.38 kcal/mol. Structural changes, kinetics, and mechanisms of reduction and carbon deposition with H2 and H2-CO gas mixtures is discussed.

MECHANISM OF NB TRANSFER TO HOT METAL FROM SLAG:</B> Fan Peng, Yang Tianjun, Zhou Yusheng, Dong Yicheng, Wei Shoukun, Sichuan Union University, P.O. Box 373, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610065, China
<P>
Nb-bearing iron ores are today the most significant source of niobium in China. Ferroalloy of Nb, as the main product of Nb recovered from Nb-bearing iron ores, is recently produced by the following route. Nb-bearing iron concentrate is reduced in a blast furnace to generate Nb-bearing hot metal, which is then smelted in a converter to yield Nb-enriched slag. Finally Nb- enriched slag is reduced in an electric furnace to get ferroalloy of Nb. In order to improve the recovery ratio of Nb, it is important to acquire a deep understanding on how Nb is transferred to hot metal from slag. In the present work, raw material containing niobium oxide were carbothermally reduced under the conditions of calm metal-slag interface or stirred metal-slag interface, respectively. Under the former condition, the quenched samples were found through SEM observations that NbC layer occurred at the metal-slag interface. In this case, Nb transfer to hot metal from slag slows down and the rate controlling step is Nb diffusion in NbC layer. Under the later conditions, it was found that no NbC layer occurred at the metal-slag interface, indicating that NbC formed at the interface sunk into hot metal due to the higher density of NbC than that of hot metal. In this case, the rate controlling step is Nb diffusion in slag.<P>

<P>A series of LaNi5-based alloys, with partial substitution of Ni by Al, Co, or V, were prepared. The gas-phase hydrogen absorption kinetics and pressure-Composition-temperature curves were measured. The activation became easier and the plateau pressure was reduced as Ni was partially substituted by Al. Substitution with Co reduced the hysteresis as well as the hydrogenation capacity. Less degradation of hydrogenation capacity after long cycles of hydriding- dehydriding was observed when substituted with both Al and Co. Vanadium is often considered as a hydride former, but when it was added to LaNi5 it was found that V occupied the B site. A small amount of substitution of Ni with V led to a higher hydrogenation capacity and faster activation rate.

<P>DETERMINING THE J-CRACK GROWTH RESISTANCE BEHAVIOUR OF A DUCTILE MATERIAL: </B><I>Edward Smith</I>, Manchester Materials Science Center, Manchester University and UMIST, Grosnover Street, Manchester M1 7HS, UK
<P>
Ductile fracture has been the major theme of Frank McClintock's research career. This paper is concerned with the determination of a ductile material's crack growth resistance behaviour when it is expressed in terms of the deformation J-integral <I>JD</I>. Attention is focussed on the determination of the crack growth resistance curve from load, load-point displacement and crack extension measurements using single loaboratory test specimen. A commonly used procedure is based on the separation of <I>JD</I> into an elastic component <I>JE</I> and a plastic component <I>JDP</I>, and the ability to express <I>JDP</I> for a non-growing crack in terms of the plastic energy integrals via eta factors that are independent of the applied loadings. The paper highlights the conditions which must be satisfied for <I>JDP</I> to be expressed in this way, and the limitations of some currently used practices based on this <I>JDP</I> formulation are indicated. Against this background, the author reviews his &quot;two extremes&quot; procedure, whereby the appropriate eta factors are obtained by ensuring that <I>JDP</I> assumes the correct form at the two extreme levels of deformation: small-scale yielding and extensive deformation at limit load conditions. Determination of the eta factors requires only a knowledge of the stress intensity factor and the limit load solutions, and not the material flow properties. The &quot;two extremes&quot; procedure is validated by comparing its predictions with well documented results for specific geometrical configurations. However, the procedure can be applied to any geometrical configuration, and the paper provides some examples.

PREDICTING THE DUCTILE-TO-BRITTLE TRANSITION IN NUCLEAR PRESSURE VESSEL STEELS FROM CHARPY SURVEILLANCE SPECIMENS:</B> <I>James A. Joyce</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering, U.S. Naval Academy, 590 Holloway Road, Annapolis, MD 21402
<P>
One important application of elastic-plastic fracture mechanics has been to assure the structural integrity of nuclear reactor pressure vessels. Present toughness requirements are based on the postulation of a large defect size, the use of dynamic test data to give lower bound toughness values, and the use of safety factors on the allowable stresses. As vessels have aged the material toughness has degraded and the ductile-to-brittle transition has shifted toward the vessel operating temperature. Extrapolating this process means that many existing vessels will not meet the present toughness requirements well before the end of their design lives. The need to superimpose multiple safety factors, as is presently done has thus been questioned, and much recent research has been directed toward lessening the toughness requirements while maintaining a high level of structural integrity. The situation remains difficult, however, at least in part because only Charpy specimens are available as surveillance specimens for many commercial reactor vessels, and these specimens are too small to obtain any type of &quot;valid&quot; fracture toughness information using standard ASTM methods. Presently a lower bound KIR toughness curve is shifted relative to reference temperature RTNDT and used to define the ductile-to brittle transition. The RTNDT is thus a very critical value, and difficulties have arisen because of the wide variability that can result in its estimation. Recent work by ASTM Committee E08 has proposed a method to obtain a new reference temperature and a method to define using a probabilistic approach, a median ductile-to-brittle transition curve from a set of six properly tested small samples which would in many cases be precracked Charpy specimens. This method seems to be very robust, predicting a reference temperature with small variability. From the results of these specimens a &quot;master curve&quot; can be developed defining the median ductile-to-brittle transition curve as well as statistical confidence bounds. This curve is plant specific and could be used to assure that the pressure vessel had adequate toughness for continued operation. This paper presents a large data set on two pressure vessel steels, A515 and A533B, obtained to investigate the newly proposed ASTM test method. Data is available on a large number of precracked Charpy specimens, as well as data on standard IT C(T) and SE (B) specimens. Additional data is also available on large specimens, specimens with shallow cracks (a/W = 0.1), and surface cracked geometries tested in tension, bending, and combined tension and bending. Most specimens demonstrated cleavage failure - in some instances after significant amounts of ductile crack extension. Since the data sets are not presently complete, how well the new procedure fares cannot be determined. The applicability of constraint quantification and correction techniques that are presently being developed separately by this project will be included in the final analysis. The comparison of the large and small specimens, the surface cracked and through cracked specimens, and the predominantly bend and tensile loadings should allow a clear determination of the value of the new proposed ASTM &quot;master curve&quot; approach.

<P>A COMMON FORMAT APPROACH FOR APPLYING DUCTILE FRACTURE MECHANICS:</B> <I>John D. Landes+</I> and J. R. B. Cruz*, +Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996; IPEN, *S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil (on leave to the University of Tennessee)
<P>
<P>Applications of ductile fracture mechanics methods to prediction of structural behavior can be done using numerical or analytical methods. Numerical methods can be more accurate but are often beyond the capability of ordinary engineering organizations. Also the result may have relevance only to the specific structure being analyzed. Analytical methods have often used a failure diagram approach in which the failure load of a structure can be estimated. A ductile fracture methodology proposed by <I>Landes, et. al. </I> took the load versus displacement for a laboratory specimen and through a series of analytical steps predicted the load versus displacement behavior for a structural component. The prediction could be made for any geometry where the information on limit load, and the calibration of fracture parameters was available. This prediction gave a more complete information in that both the maximum load could be determined as well as the stability of the structure after maximum load. The prediction of the loading behavior during ductile fracture depends on the deformation behavior of the structure and the cracking behavior, usually the former is the more important. The ductile fracture methodology uses a principal of load separation proposed by Ernst in which the loading of a cracked body can be specified by separate but multiplicative functions, one of geometry, that is cracking behavior, and one of deformation. The load versus displacement for the specimen is separated into two functional behaviors, a transfer is made for these functions from the specimen geometry to the structural component geometry and two functions are combined to predict load versus displacement of the structural component. The entire procedure could be completed with a hand calculator. Since the first proposal of this ductile fracture methodology, additional work has been done on the determination of the deformation behavior for the structural component. Donoso, et. al. showed that deformation behavior of any structural component, including test specimens geometries, can be derived from the basic stress-strain behavior of the material. With this the deformation behavior of the component can be determined from that of the specimen using common functional expressions with similar constants, ones that be determined from the stress-strain behavior and transferred to any common geometry with a set calibration factors that pertain to that geometry. This approach was labeled, the &quot;common format&quot; approach. Using this &quot;common format&quot; approach the ductile fracture methodology was revisited to see if the procedure could be simplified using the calibration factors to transfer from one geometry to another, namely from test specimen to structural component. This paper describes the result of that study. What was found was that the 'common format' calibration factors can be used to transfer the load factors based on material stress. However, a difficulty rose with the transfer of strain factors. The relation of the structural displacement to strain behavior is sensitive to the type of displacement being measured, that is placement of the gage, and gage length. In order to complete an easy transfer of specimen deformation characteristics to the structural component, strain calibration factors need to be determined. With the development of these, the procedure in the ductile fracture methodology can be made easier and application of ductile fracture mechanics greatly facilitated.

<P>A NEW MODEL TO CALCULATE THE CRACK EXTENSION:</B> <I>Inhoy Gu</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756, South Korea
<P>
<P>A fracture analysis method is proposed on the criterion that the resistance to crack extension can be characterized in the critical CTOA, an instantaneous ratio of CTOD increment to stepwise crack extension. The CTOD of finite element analysis is written in a function of crack length and applied stress for the load range up to near the limit load. The normalized CTOD function for the compact specimen is independent of crack length ratio with some conditions, under which the function can be used in the crack-extension analysis. After crack initiation, the CTOD increments due to a load increment and a crack increment are successively calculated to determine another crack extension, with their integrations during the stable crack growth. The calculations are made to fit to the tests of effective crack lengths by appropriate fracture constants. The cleavage fracture mode is characterized in the crack growth without crack opening. The total CTOD for the cleavage fracture of Al 7075-T651 increases a little as the specimen size increases greatly. Thus the cleavage fracture may occur with a rising load in big specimens and with a falling load in small specimens. The critical CTOA for the ductile fracture of Al 2024-T351 decreases with an<B> </B>increasing specimen size. The size-corrected fracture constants are applied to calculate the failure loads on other compact and center-cracked specimens, in good agreement with the available test loads. The fracture-predicting capability of the proposed method seems promising from cleavage to ductile fracture modes regardless of crack extension, probably, except the limit-load fracture. Therefore, the fracture constants may account for specimen property as well as material property, and they are transferred between specimens.

<P>The influence of stress state on ductile fracture is examined on the basis of both experiments and computational modeling. Using HY-100 steel as a model material, we examine the failure of notched tensile specimens in terms of the void initiation, growth, and linking process. Particular attention is given to the issue of void linking as a result of either global coalescence, which occurs at high stress triaxilities, or a localized void-sheet process, as is observed at high stress triaxilities. The void-sheet mode of linking is modeled on the basis of microstructural conditions present in the HY-100 steel with the result that the predicted influence of stress state agrees well with experimental observations. The transition to global void coalescence, and a much greater sensitivity of failure stress to stress state, is also addressed.

<P>MIXED-MODE NON-LINEAR FRACTURE ALONG INTERFACES:</B> <I>John L. Bassani,</I> N.J.-J. Fang, Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104
<P>
Recently, problems in interfacial fracture have led to a general interest in planar crack growth under mixed-mode loading. Of particular interest is the relationship between the applied stress intensity/mode-mix and the corresponding quantities near the crack tip. We have developed mixed-mode solutions of the HRR type and of the Hui-Riedel type for stationary and propagating interface cracks. In contrast, asymptotic and small-scale yielding solutions for the crack growth in a time-independent elastic-plastic material predict that the mode mix (tension versus shear) in the vicinity of the crack tip can only take on discrete values rather than varying continuously with the mode mix of the remotely applied elastic fields. In the case of a stationary interface crack or a growing creep crack in either homogeneous materials or along interfaces we have found crack-tip solutions which admit a continuous variation of mode mix within certain limits. Slip line solutions for stationary interface cracks have also been developed. These asymptotic solutions are in good agreement with small-scale-yielding finite element calculations that include the transient growth period.

<P>
For many metallic materials the Gurson model modified by Needleman and Tvergaard describes the ductile rupture process characterized by nucleation, growth and coalescence of voids. Since these local processes are similar in smooth specimens and in cracked specimens, a material dependent critical volume fraction of voids, <I>fc</I>, may be determined from numerical analyses of tensile tests. However, because of the strong gradient in the stress-strain field at the crack tip an additional length parameter, <I>lc</I>, is required to model the coalescence process in cracked specimens. Since the effects of triaxiality are adequately taken into account in the model, <I>fc</I> and <I>lc</I> may be transferred to specimens with different shapes and sizes. Hence, it is possible to evaluate ductile fracture resistance curves for different geometries and loading conditions with the same set of micromechanical parameters. The authors have applied this local approach to ductile fracture for a series of ferritic and austenitic steels including weld materials even after neutron embrittlement. Besides notched and smooth tensile specimens of standard sizes also miniature specimens with diameter down to 2 mm have been used for the determination of <I>fc</I>. Dynamic effects have been taken into account based on dynamic tensile tests and visco-plastic formulation to model the strain-rate sensitivity of the stress-strain curves. The characteristic length is usually determined for small SENB-specimens. As examples, instrumented impact tests with SENB and Charpy specimens have been simulated using three-dimensional models.

<P>
It is now well established that radiation embrittlement of ferritic steels such as used for pressure boundary applications is sensitive not only to the alloying elements (Cu, Ni, P etc.) and interstitial impurities (IIAs) such as C and N, but also radiation flux and irradiation temperature. The increased strength and decreased ductility in the DSA region leads to reduced energy to fracture and this region usually lies in the upper shelf regime. This is also clearly evident in the elastic-plastic fracture toughness (<I>JIC</I>). While dips in the fracture energy are noted in steels, pure (Armco) showed peaks in this region apparently due to the increased rates of work-hardening. Exposure to neutron irradiation suppressed the effects of DSA leading to <I>apparent</I> increased energy values at temperatures where dips are noted in the unirradiated materials. Such tests on pure iron are in progress and results to-date will be reported here. Radiation effects on Hall-Petch relation are investigated in pure iron, and radiation exposure resulted in increased friction hardening and decreased source hardening which lead to interesting effects of thermal neutrons on radiation hardening of these materials.

<P>
<P>X-Ray tomographic microscopy (XTM) is a promising technique to investigate ductile fracture because voids formed under conditions of high triaxiality can be directly observed nondestructively. In this experiment, ultra high vacuum diffusion bonding has been used to make model specimens in the Al/sapphire system. Samples were prepared in the 4-point bend geometry with notch. XTM images acquired after several loadings of the sample revealed the morphology of the growing voids. The primary finds are that (i) damage ahead of the notch initiates by interface debonding at a location coinciding with maxima in triaxiality and tensile traction at the interface, (ii) debonding occurs at the most early stages in the observation of plasticity, (iii) the debond expands for a limited distance, likely arresting due to crack tip blunting, (iv) this lenticular debond then becomes spherical with further strain, and (v) intergrowth of the spherical voids leads to the typical ductile rupture fracture surfaces observed in the system.

Microscopic of microplasticity evidence is shown to include: slip band localization via shear localization; grain boundary sliding; subgrain formation; deformation-induced precipitation; and localized flow mechanisms. Ductile fracture is shown to initiate by coalescence of voids that are nucleated around stress-induced precipitates. Deformation in the so-called elastic regime is shown to be associated with the spread of localized plasticity phenomena across the gauge. Linear plasticity concepts are used to explain the initial deformation characteristics. The implications of microplasticity are also assessed for fatigue damage initiation and ductile fracture initiation.

<B>APPROXIMATE SOLUTIONS FOR STRAIN HARDENING SOLID WITH A CRACK:</B> <I>Yu G. Matvienko</I>, Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, 4 Griboedov Street, 101830 Moscow, Russia
<P>
A working out of nonlinear fracture mechanics criteria and application of calculation methods requires the availability of solutions to elastic-plastic crack problems. Such solutions depend on details of deformation behaviour of materials. For most cases the solutions must be computed numerically and that could be connected with some difficulties. Therefore, a working out of approximate analytical solutions is an actual problem. New analytical solutions relate J-integral to applied stress, notch (crack) geometry and strain hardening. The method is based on stress concentration analysis near a notch-crack tip in strain hardening solid. Approximate analytical J-solutions are calculated in accordance with the theoretical stress concentration factor formulas of Neuber for several crack configurations: elliptical notch in infinite plate, deep grooved shaft, deep double etch notch, shallow double notch in tension. The important role of J-integral is a measure of the intensity of the near-tip stress and strain that can be written in the form of the HRR-singularity. So, to assess J-dominance for fully plastic conditions the HRR-model and the method based on an equation of equilibrium was employed. It was assumed that (i) the characteristic size of the singularity is determined by the condition of the equality of the singularity stress and the applied stress, (ii) the force, that is not transmitted by the crack, is counterbalanced by the additional force of the singularity stress field depends strongly on the crack size and weakly on hardening. To predict the behaviour of a crack in ductile materials it is necessary to use non-linear fracture mechanics criteria. One such criterion can be associated with the failure assessment diagram (FAD) which merges the two extreme brittle fracture and plastic collapse. New FAD has been obtained from the energy balance taking into account crack tip blunting and difference between the energy of surface stresses and the surface energy. The present work assumes the relation between crack blunting and J-integral.

<B>ESTIMATION OF DUCTILE FRACTURE TOUGHNESS FROM TENSILE TESTS FOR ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS:</B> <I>S.K. Ray</I>, A.K. Bhaduri and P. Rodriguez, Fracture Mechanics Section, Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam 603 102, India
<P>
An empirical method for characterizing the ductile fracture toughness using two parameter (viz., <I>Gf</I> and <I>hf</I>) that can be determined from tensile test data of smooth cylindrical specimens has been evolved for engineering applications by Ray, Bhaduri and Rodriguez (herein after referred to as the <I>RBR</I> method). This stipulates that the post-necking regime during tensile deformation is demonstrated by microvoid growth and coalescence processes, and therefore the energy absorbed in this regime can be used to estimate the resistance of the necked region to ductile fracture. The test procedure employed is simple, and does not require gauge-length extensometry. The test is carried out in a screw-driven machine at constant cross-head speed, with on-line deformation of the load train. The method of computing <I>RBR</I> parameters, <I>Gf</I> and <I>hf</I> from the tensile test data at ambient and elevated temperatures, is described.
<P>
With <I>Wpn</I> the energy absorbed by the specimen from necking to fracture and <I>An</I> the uniform cross-sectional area at the necking point, the parameters <I>GfWpn/An</I> estimates the average energy per unit cross-sectional area required to cause fracture. Also, with <I>Af</I> as the minimum cross-sectional area of the neck at fracture, <I>ln(An/Af)</I> measures the average longitudinal plastic strain perpendicular to the plane of the neck accumulated from the point of necking to fracture. Therefore, the parameter, <I>&#165;f=Gf/ln(An/Af)</I> estimates the average incremental plastic energy per unit volume by the specimen per unit longitudinal plastic strain at the neck to sustain the fracture process. In the post-necking regime of tensile deformation with progressive development of the neck, the absorption of energy tends to get increasingly confined to the near-neck section, and therefore <I>Gf</I> and more so <I>&#165;f</I> reflect the resistance of this region to microvoid growth. Hence, for an initially homogeneous ductile specimen, the <I>RBR</I> parameters estimate the toughness in a severely work-hardened condition and for a state of stress which is a combination of uniaxial tensile and hydrostatic stresses. For a specimen with gradient in toughness along its length, for example a transverse-weld specimen the neck is expected to initiate at the section least resistant to microvoid growth. For such a specimen, therefore the <I>RBR</I> method automatically determines the toughness of the weakest section, without a prior knowledge as to its location or the need for placing a notch or crack in the section. The advantage of the <I>RBR</I> method has been successfully exploited to characterize the effect of aging of three different dissimilar metal weld (DMW) joints viz. (i) an Alloy 800/2.25Cr-1Mo steel joint (at 300 K), (ii) an Alloy 800/9Cr-1Mo steel joint (at 300 K) and (iii) a type 316LN stainless steel/Alloy 800 joint (at 773 K), including determination of the optimum post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) temperature determined from the<I> RBR</I> toughness parameters is identical to that determined by the conventional method of correlating the microstructure with conventional tensile properties. For the Alloy 800/9Cr-1Mo steel DMW joint, the <I>RBR</I> toughness parameters led to unambiguous identification of the optimum PWHT temperature while the conventional structure-property method failed to do so. The efficacy and sensitivity of the two new ductile fracture toughness parameters have also been demonstrated.

<P>There are several ways of approaching the problems of fracture. One of them is through algorithmic modelisation. We follow the ideas of a stochastic process, i.e. the most extreme situation, in order to find whether general behaviors of fracture phenomena can be quantified and if so through which ingredients. We use the numerical power of coarse grain cases allowing for easy access to asymptotic time regimes. Atoms on sites in a two dimensional plane are supposed to be ejected inside or outside an initial boundary. Several &quot;percolation/fracture-like&quot; path were found as a function of size. The concentration of the various crack thresholds, the distribution of clusters, the fractal dimension of the cracks were obtained. Power law features were indicative of essential processes. It will be shown that the rules give sometimes rise to &quot;healing processes&quot;.

<B>ATOMISTIC STUDIES OF CRACK PROPAGATION:</B> <I>Diana Farkas</I>, Vijay Shastri, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061-0219
<P>
We will present the results of atomistic studies of fracture in ordered intermetallic alloys using the embedded atom method. The propagations of cracks is studied through atomistic computer simulation with particular emphasis on the competition between crack propagation and dislocation emission processes at the crack tip. The boundary conditions for these simulations are obtained from continuum elasticity theory and the region close to the crack is allowed to relax in order to achieve the minimum energy configuration. The atomistic simulations enable the study of the local atomic configuration at the crack tip in a realistic crystal structure and its importance for crack propagation. The studies include the simulation of crack structure and propagation in the presence of dislocations, in an effort to contribute to the modeling of ductile fracture processes.

Localized necking is one of the most common failure modes limiting formability in technological sheet metal forming operations. Prediction of localized necking for general three dimensional components using finite element simulations can be very useful in die/process design. Different failure criteria, based on macroscopic quantities, are used to predict localized necking. This presentation will compare the results from these different failure criteria for some standard geometries. The effect of applied boundary conditions on these results will also be discussed.

<P>
Micromechanisms of tensile deformation and fracture in a metastable beta Ti-15V-3Cr-3Al-3Sn alloy are elucidated in this paper. Tensile deformation is shown to be associated with significant levels of microplasticity at stress levels above ~10% of the tensile yield strength. Microplasticity in the so-called elastic regime is shown to occur via shear localization and concomitant slip band formation; grain boundary sliding; subgrain formation; stress induced a phase precipitation; and atomic flow mechanisms that are not fully understood at present. Ductile fracture is also shown to initiate by decohesion around a precipitates produced largely via stress-induced precipitation. Catastrophic failure in the metastable beta Ti-15V-3Cr-3Al-3Sn alloy is shown to occur by the coalescence of microvoids produced via decohesion around a precipitates. Attempts are made to model the ductile fracture processes using classical ductile fracture theories. The implications of the microplasticity phenomena are also discussed within the context of elasticity and plasticity theories.

<B>DAMAGE EVOLUTION IN HYPO- AND PSEUDO-EUTECTIC Al-Si ALLOYS:</B> <I>Tz. Kamenova</I>, R. Doglione, J.L. Douziech, C. Berdin and Dominique Fran&ccedil;ois, &Eacute;cole Centrale Paris, Laboratoire De M&eacute;chanique, Grande Voie des Vignes, F-92295 Ch&acirc;tenay-Malabry Cedex, France
<P>
The evolution of fracture processes in an hypoeutectic and in an eutectic Al-Si cast alloys has been studied by means of in situ tensile tests SEM observations. Chilled and cast alloys were investigated. It has been established that the damage initiates at low strains (of the order of 0.5%) by fracture of the largest Si particles, situated at the periphery of eutectic colonies. When the strain increases, finer and finer particles break within the colonies. In the hypereutectic alloys further straining induces a concentration of the damage along the fine interdentritic particles alignments. This leads to the formation of intensive slip bands in these regions followed by microcracks coalescence. The cracks thus created stop at the eutectic colonies, until final fracture by their propagation. The validity of the Weibull statistics to describe the number of cracked Si particles as a function of the applied load was proven. It was also observed that the volume increase of the microcracks was very small. These observations allowed to build a model of damage evolution based on micromechanics of inclusions at two different scales, that of eutectic colony and that of the whole specimen, yielding the fracture probability in the various zones.

When fracture occurs by micro-void coalescence the fracture toughnesses of structural steels are controlled by both the inclusion distribution and the fine-scale microstructure. The characteristics of the inclusion distributions which influence toughness include volume fraction, spacing and void nucleation resistance. The effects of inclusion distributions on toughness are, however, not independent of the fine-scale microstructure and the extent to which varying characteristics of the inclusion distributions influences toughness can depend on the fine-scale microstructure. This talk will focus on three areas. First the effects of inclusion spacing and void nucleation resistance of inclusion particles will be discussed. Second, the degree to which such effects are influenced by fine-scale microstructure, in particular austenite grain size, will be considered. It has been found that the most effective way of minimizing the detrimental effect of inclusions on fracture toughness is to getter sulfide as titanium carbo-sulfide as particles of titanium carbo-sulfide are more resistant to void nucleation than particles of other sulfides such as MnS. Therefore, the third topic to be considered will be the effect of alloy composition on the formation of as titanium carbo-sulfide.

The effect of mode I and mixed-mode I/III loading on the fracture behavior of a vanadium alloy containing 4 wt% Cr and 4 wt% Ti (V4Cr4Ti) was investigated at room temperature. The V4Cr4Ti alloy was annealed at 1000&#176;C for 1 hour in vacuum. Compact tension (CT) specimens were used to study mode I properties and modified compact tension (MCT) specimens were used for mixed-mode I/III. A MCT specimen is the same as a CT specimen except the principal axis of the crack plane is slanted at an angle of 25 and 45 degrees from the load line. When the crack angle is equal to zero, a MCT specimen becomes a CT specimen. With the MCT specimen, an applied load can be resolved to mode I load (Pi) and mode III load (Piii) at the crack tip. The mixities [Piii/Piii+Pi] used were 0, 0.32 and 0.5 for crack angles 0, 25 and 45 degrees, respectively. It was found that the introduction of Piii dramatically lowered fracture toughness of V4Cr4Ti alloy. The mechanism how mixed-mode I/III loading affects fracture behavior of the V4Cr4Ti alloy is discussed.

We investigate the propagation of a semi-infinite, mode III crack at constant KIII. At each time step, crack can grow and/or screw dislocations can be emitted from the crack tip. This model incorporates dislocation interactions with the crack, other dislocations, and all image dislocations. The emitted dislocations can significantly shield the crack. Dislocation-dislocation and dislocation-crack interactions are calculated using the fast multipole method applied within a stress-function framework. Dislocation-crack interactions are described using a conformal mapping procedure. Dislocation microstructures, generated from the crack tip, are shown over a wide range of loading rates. With increasing loading rate, a transition is observed from ductile-to-brittle behavior. However, even when the crack propagates in a brittle manner, significant dislocation emission occurs first. The dislocation microstructures observed are very complex and highly organized. As the load continues to increase, several distinct transitions in dislocation microstructure are observed. The effects of pre-existing dislocation network within the material are also examined. The dislocation network is strongly modified by the crack, decreases dislocation emission from the crack tip and, after evolution in the crack tip field, provides some crack tip blunting.

<B>MECHANISMS OF DUCTILE FRACTURE IN PURE SILVER UNDER HIGH-TRIAXIAL STATES: </B><I>Michael E. Kassner</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering and The Center for Advanced Materials Research, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331
<P>
Experimental and finite element method (FEM) analyses were used to study the mechanisms of ductile fracture of constrained, high purity, silver interlayers under high triaxial stress states. Interlayer bonds loaded in simple tension develop a principal stress state that is large and axisymmetric. Ductile, plastic-strain failure was observed in these bonds when the maximum mean stress to yield ratio () approached approximately four, in agreement with recent numerical analyses by other investigators, who postulated unstable growth of a cavity subjected to a far-field axisymmetric stress state at this ratio, without significant far-field plastic strain. Ambient temperature delayed-failure (creep) tests of constrained silver interlayers, at relatively low applied loads, also appear to be due to unstable cavity growth. The mechanism of ductile fracture was further studied by biaxially loading these interlayers through the application of various combinations of tension and torsion loads. Low macroscopic-strain ductile fractures are again observed, but the axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric failure-stress values and FEM analysis of the stress levels required for cavity instability do not directly support an unstable growth model, even when considerations for plastic incompatibilities across grain boundaries are considered. Other ductile fracture theories such as cavity nucleation and interlinkage warrant consideration.

<P>
Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE; 4x103 g/mole) is commonly used as artificial cartilage in orthopedic implants. Several processing methods are used to fabricate the stock material, followed by machining, and gamma-irradiation sterilization prior to final implantation. Over the 15 year anticipated lifetime, cyclic and tribological loading change the properties of the material. The need for improved implant lifetimes motivated a detailed investigation of the relationships between processing/sterilization and properties in UHMWPE. Gamma irradiation changes the mechanical properties by promoting enhanced crystallization, while lifetime aging results in the formation of carbon-oxygen groups that change the subsequent properties. Both effects improved the ductility of the materials and led to overall improvements in yield strength, tensile strengths elastic modulus. These results are in sharp contrast to previous studies where any increase in crystallinity decreased the ductility of the UHMWPE. A broad array of experimental techniques were utilized to verify the measured changes in microstructure and properties. We will report on these changes in mechanical properties coupled with a fractographic analysis of failed specimens to relate the mechanisms of ductile failure in UHMWPE to the microstructural changes brought about by production, fabrication, sterilization and aging of these implant materials.

<P>
As fracture mechanics has developed as a discipline, many parameters have been developed to characterize the instability condition. However, a majority of this work has been confined to the investigation of mode I fracture. Thus, we have standardized methods for experimentally determining KIC, JIC and J-resistance curves for mode I crack propagation. However, cracks in real materials can be subjected not just to tensile stresses but to complex stress states so that the development of suitable parameters to characterize mixed-mode crack initiation and propagation is important in the evolution of suitable design criteria. Further, observations indicate that initially flat cracks in some tough materials tend to reorient themselves to oblique planes during growth. For these materials, crack propagation can be said to occur under combined mode conditions. A considerable amount of work on mixed mode I/III fracture toughness of materials is available. The superposition of mode III loading results in drastic reduction in fracture toughness in some materials whereas in other materials it has little effect or even results in an increase in the fracture toughness. Fracture mechanism maps delineating regions of susceptibility to tensile and shear loads have been proposed. In this paper, data on a wider range of materials, including steels, aluminum alloys, metal matrix composites, ceramics and polymers will be used to extend and reinforce the fracture mechanism map concept.

<B>EFFECTS OF STRESS STATE ON DEFORMATION AND FRACTURE OF STRUCTURAL MATERIALS:</B> John J. Lewandowski, Dept. of Materials Science and Eng., Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106
<P>
The deformation and fracture of structural materials is significantly affected by changes in the microstructure and imposed stress state. Such changes in stress state may affect the micro-mechanisms of failure whereby a material which normally fails in a ductile manner may undergo a ductile-to brittle transition. In other cases, the imposition of a more severe stress state may accelerate the stages of ductile fracture to such an extent that very low ductility is obtained. The imposed stress state may be easily changed via testing notched specimens or via testing with confining pressure in monolithic materials. The presentation will review previous and ongoing work investigating the effects of stress state on the fracture of a variety of metallic materials, including more recent work on metallic composites.

<B>EFFECT OF HYDROGEN ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF LOW CARBON STEEL:</B> B. Sarkar, D. Mukerjee, R&D Centre for Iron and Steel, Steel Authority of India Limited, Ranchi-834002, India
<P>
The effect of hydrogen on the mechanical properties of a low carbon steel has been investigated. In-situ tensile and hardness tests have been carried out while charging hydrogen. It has been observed that there is a substantial reduction in ductility as a result of hydrogen charging while there is no change in hardness. The strain hardening exponent (n) value decreased from 0.26 to 0.22 ( a decrease of about 15%) whereas, the total elongation decreased from a value of 44.2% to 33.8% (a fall of about 24%) as a result of hydrogen charging. This is suggestive of the fact that hydrogen charging affects all the stages of ductile fracture. Hydrogen charging has been found to increase the number of dimple nucleating sites. Consequently there was a decrease in the average dimple size. It is believed that the effect of hydrogen on the reduction of ductility is more prominent in the post necking region. It has been concluded that hydrogen charging enhances the number of dimple nucleating sites which promotes the process of ductile fracture.

<P>A computer model, Discrete Element Consolidation Analyzer (DECA), is described which was developed with support from Wright Laboratory, to assist in the optimization and control of the so-called tape-cast powder monotape processing method for titanium matrix composite consolidation. DECA simulates the viscoplastic densification of a randomly packed spherical titanium alloy powder aggregate and continuous fiber array by hot pressing. Using state variable analysis together with automated remeshing, the model performs a continuous simulation of powder particle contact-contact interaction, free surface evolution and void closure. A unique capability of this model is the realistic simulation of the final random powder packing geometry, prior to consolidation, following the debulking, i.e., binder off-gassing, and powder settling and fiber rearrangement, of the initial tape-cast powder/fiber monotape.

<P>Intelligent, cost effective processing of powder based materials requires an understanding of the key physical variables during processing and the ability to implement these variables into suitable analytical models that can describe the overall consolidation behavior of the powdered material during fabrication. In this presentation, a modified form of the Gurson continuum level densification model, derived through a micromechanical approach, is developed and applied to an aluminum metal matrix composite reinforced with SiC particulate. The results of this model, also applicable to short or chopped fiber reinforced powder based composite material, capture the influence that volume fraction of reinforcement has on the densification of the powder based aluminum alloy metal matrix composite and provides the first step of the analytical framework needed for designing a process model capable of describing the consolidation behavior of the composite material during a powder forging type fabrication process.

<P>The modeling of the deformation and densification behavior of metal powders during hot consolidation processes was treated through the application of a continuum yield function and associated flow rule modified to incorporate microstructure effects such as grain growth, pore size, and pore geometry. It was shown that consolidation behavior can be described over the entire range of densities through two parameters, Poisson's ratio and the stress intensification factor, which are readily measured using uniaxial upset tests. The accuracy of the material modeling approach was validated by comparing the densification predicted from both a simple analytical model and an FEM with observed behavior during the die-pressing of monolithic gamma titanium aluminide powder and the hot-isostatic pressing of tapecast monotape composite layups comprising alpha-two titanium powder and continuous silicon carbide fibers. In addition, the effect of pore anisotropy on the yielding and flow behavior of partially consolidated powder compacts was addressed.

<P>
<P>The important mechanisms during the early stages of metal powder consolidation are not well understood nor are they properly included in consolidation models. The result is that models tend to underpredict strain-rates, particularly during the early stages of consolidation. In a series of interrupted HIP experiments, PREP Ti-6Al-4V powder was consolidated in thin-walled containers, and the resulting partially consolidated specimens examined metallographically. Stereo micrographs of fractured specimen surfaces were examined qualitatively and quantitatively to gain insights into early stage mechanisms and appropriate modeling approaches. Evidence of particle rearrangement was found throughout the early stages of consolidation. Contact areas between particles increase in size at a much slower rate than is predicted by popular mechanistic models. Particle size effects, including rigid body motion of larger particles facilitated by preferential deformation of small particles, contribute to rearrangement. The critical assumptions required for common mechanistic and continuum models are not consistent with the observed mechanisms and behaviors requiring new modeling approaches that are consistent with the observed behavior.

<P>
<P>Nanostructured metals are a potentially-promising class of materials with ultrafine grain sizes. A limitation on commercial implementation of nanostructured materials has been grain coarsening during consolidation. In this research, attritor-milled powders with 20 nm grain sizes inside micrometer-sized powder particles were consolidated by induction heating and rapid forging of cold-pressed compacts. Grain growth was limited by minimizing the time at consolidation temperature. Fully-dense materials were obtained at relatively low temperatures around 500&#176;C. The consolidation process was successfully modeled with the Arzt-Ashby-Easterling HIP model, modified slightly for geometrical constraints, stress state and the nature of the nanostructured metal. Modeling and mechanical testing indicated that creep dominated the consolidation process, apparently due to the ultrafine microstructures. Mechanical properties at ambient and elevated temperatures.

<P>The atomic structure of Pd-Ni-P bulk amorphous alloys was studied by the anomalous (resonance) x-ray scattering technique using synchrotron radiation tuned near the Pd K-edge. Bulk samples of Pd40Ni40P20, Pd30Ni50P20, and Pd50Ni34P16 amorphous alloys were prepared by the flux method in the form of rods with the diameter of 10-14 mm. X-ray measurements were carried out at the X-7A beamline of the NSLS, Brookhaven National Laboratory. The results show that the structures are basically described by the dense random packed structure with small chemical short-range order. The implication of this result with respect to the stability of the glass will be discussed.

<P>
<P>A number of methods have been used to undercool liquid silicon and germanium: levitation melting, flux treatments, atomization, rapid cooling following laser melting of thin films, and quenching of droplet dispersions. An amorphous phase has been produced so far only in small volumes. The competition between the kinetics of nucleation and growth of the crystalline and the amorphous phases under these various conditions will be reviewed, and the possibility of obtaining bulk amounts of the amorphous phase will be assessed.

<P>THERMODYNAMIC FRAMEWORK FOR SOLID-STATE AMORPHIZATION:</B> <I>D. Wolf</I>, Materials Science Division (MSD-212), Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439
<P>
Atomistic computer simulations are used to expose important thermodynamic parallels between melting and solid-state amorphization and the important role of nanocrystalline microstructures. Molecular-dynamics simulations demonstrate that every crystal can, in principle, melt by two entirely different causes and underlying mechanisms; a comparison with experiments suggests that both can be operative in solid-state amorphization1. Also, simulations of a model nanocrystalline material exhibit the existence of low- and high-frequency lattice-vibrational modes not seen in the perfect crystal but also present in the amorphous phase2. The possibility of a reversible, free-energy based transition between these two metastable phases that is governed by a critical grain size is discussed together with possible mechanisms for the transition.

The magnitude and temperature dependence of the liquid state shear modulus G, specific heat Cp, diffusivity D and viscosity <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/eta.gif"> are all closely related, according to the interstitialcy model. It has been proposed by Dyne, Olsen and Christensen that the viscosity is given by <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/eta.gif">=h0exp(F/kT) where h0 is a reference viscosity and F is given by the work required to shove aside neighboring particles in a diffusion process, where F=GVc and Vc is a characteristic volume. In the interstitialcy model, the high frequency thermodynamic liquid state shear modulus is given by G(T)=G0exp[(-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">(T-T0)], where G0 is the shear modulus at a reference temperature T0 which can be taken as the glass temperature. The resulting non-Arrhenius behavior of the viscosity is compared with experimental data for the shear modulus.

<P>The mobility of high-angle grain boundaries and triple junctions is the key factor, which controls the recrystallizations and grain growth processes. The mobility of individual &lt;111&gt; tilt grain boundaries in Al was measured under the constant driving force, <I>in-situ</I>, over a wide range of temperatures, in the vicinity of special misorientation and away from it, in ultra-pure Al and in Al doped with small amount of soluble impurities. The steady state motion of grain boundary systems with triple junctions was investigated <I>in</I>-situ at different temperatures on tricrystals of Zn. A transition of the steady state motion of the grain boundary system with triple junction from junction kinetics to grain boundary kinetics was observed.

<P>
<P>Two dimensional molecular dynamics simulations of grain boundary migration are performed using the half-loop bicrystal geometry employed in the experiments performed by Shvindlerman, et al. We examine the dependence of the <U>steady</U> <U>state</U> grain boundary velocity on grain boundary curvature by varying the half-loop width at constant temperature. The grain boundary velocity is proportional to the half-loop curvature and the grain boundary mobility follows an Arrhenius relationship. In the present study, we examine grain boundary migration for several different grain misorientations. We employ movies of these simulation in order to deduce the dominant mechanisms of grain boundary migration and how these mechanisms depend on grain boundary structure.

<P>
<P>The sliding of grain boundaries can be influenced by the presence of solute segregants. Additionally, the sliding mechanism itself also triggers vacancy fluxes that may result in the non-equilibrium redistribution of solute atoms at boundaries and triple points. The interaction of these two processes have been studied in Al Mg-Mn based systems with and without additions of Sn, an equilibrium segregant. Fine-grained structures have been produced and samples tested under conditions that induce grain boundary sliding (GBS). The presence of Sn on the boundaries before deformation allows easier GBS with lower cavitation. High-resolution grain boundary composition measurements on deformed samples revealed that the Sn remains on the boundary during GBS but the Mg is redistributed in a heterogeneous manner. The points to the possibility of engineering the grain boundary composition for optimized deformation characteristics and post-formed properties such as stress corrosion cracking resistance.

<P>Our research on ceramic/metal (C/M) interfaces that utilizes transmission electron, high-resolution electron, Z-contrast microscopy, and atom-probe microscopies, in collaboration with <I>ab initio</I> atomistic modeling, is presented. Heavy use is made of atom-probe microscopy to address questions concerning the chemistry of the terminating plane and segregation of solute species to the ceramic/metal interfacial region. Detailed results are presented for the {222} MgO/Cu, {222} CdO/Ag, {222} MgO/Cu(Ag), and {222} CdO/Ag(Au) interfaces. All the C/M interfaces were created via internal oxidation, at elevated temperatures, of high-purity binary or ternary metallic alloys, thereby producing atomically clean interfaces. Solute-atom segregation was induced at the {222} C/M interfaces by annealing specimens containing a ternary addition at 500&#176;C for prolonged periods of time. The level of segregation, i.e., the Gibbsian interfacial excess, is determined directly by the atom-probe technique. Results concerning <I>ab initio</I> atomistic modeling of the {222} MgO/Cu coherent interface (zero-misfit approximation), using local density functional theory (LDFT) within the plane-wave pseudopotential framework, are presented for two polar {111} and two nonpolar {100} MgO/Cu and CdO/Ag interfaces and are discussed with respect to our experimental observations.

<P>COMPUTER SIMULATION STUDIES OF THE KINETICS OF INTERFACE DIFFUSION AND PHASE FORMATION</B>: <I>J.M. Rickman</I>, Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA 18105-3195
<P>
<P>Two kinetic processes associated with grain boundaries are discussed. In the first study, we examine quantitatively the impact of heterogeneous nucleation on the temporal evolution of a phase transformation with particular emphasis on the correlation of nucleation site distribution and product phase microstructure. This is accomplished by investigating spatial correlations in the transforming system via the calculation of nonequilibrium correlation functions and by characterizing product grain sizes and shapes. Computer simulations of transformations are employed in order to validate our theoretical description and to relate microstructural features of the evolving phase to relevant length and time scales in the problem. In the second study, we investigate the kinetics of grain boundary diffusion using a spatially inhomegeneous lattice gasmodel. It is found that atomic transport can be accurately described by a series of approximate rate equations and that one can ascribe a bias, in a certain sense, to tagged atoms.

<P>
Nonequilibrium microchemistries develop at irradiated interfaces in alloys. The driving force for the radiation-induced segregation is the flow of radiation produced defects to internal interfaces. A unique feature of these segregation profiles is the narrow nanometer dimension near grain boundaries. Theoretical predictions and analytical measurements indicate that nonequilibrium composition gradients normal to grain boundaries are in excess of 106 atom fraction/cm. Fast arrival rates of radiation-produced point defects create potential influences on grain boundary structure and dynamics. Conventional theories assume that dominant mutual recombination of grain boundary defects prevents their influence on boundaries. In the present paper, the dynamics of defect arrival and annihilation are examined in relation to extreme nonequilibrium conditions at internal interfaces.

STATUS-UNIVERSITY-INDUSTRY COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH IN JAPAN: </B><I>Professor Shuji Hanada</I>, Institute of Materials Research, Tohoku University, Katahira 2-1-1, Sendai, Japan
<P>
<P>There are two types of universities in Japan; national universities and private universities. Basically, the former are supported mainly by the government (The ministry of education, culture and science-the Monbusho), while the latter partly by the government. Among them, the national universities are active to collaborative research with industry. In this talk the various systems and their activities concerning the research collaboration between national universities and industry will be addressed. In addition some recent topics will be mentioned briefly. From the early 1980s, new systems of joint research with the private sector, endowed chairs and funded research departments and centers for cooperative research were introduced. Consequently, the exchange of researchers between universities and the private sector industries has become quite active, and the sources of research funds for national universities has become diversified. Currently over three thousand outside researchers participate in research activities at universities and the total amount of funding from industry has become almost as large as the Monbusho grants-in-aid budget.
<P>
In the system of the joint research with the private sector, national universities receive researchers and funding from private industry. Then university researchers and private industry researchers combine efforts to do joint research on common projects, to enhance the likelihood of achieving excellent results. Under the commissioned research system, scientific researchers in universities are commissioned by industrial firms, government research institutes, local governments or other outside organizations to carry out research by contract. No researchers from the industrial world join in carrying out the research at the universities. In the commissioned researchers system, national universities accept technicians and researchers currently employed in private industry and other outside agencies. They are given guidance in doing research at the graduate level, which helps them to improve their abilities. Endowed chairs can be established within a faculty or department of a national university. Funded research departments can be established in a research laboratory attached to the university or in an inter-university research institute. The wages of the visiting professors or associate/assistant professors, who are appointed by the universities, and the educational and research expenses of the chairs and departments are paid totally from the endowments from the private sectors. Many national universities have Centers for Cooperative Research. These centers employ professors as part-time directors as well as full-time associate professors and part-time visiting professors. They are equipped with all purpose research facilities and provide technical consultation and training of technicians and researchers, in addition to their functions of engaging in joint and commissioned research. National universities accept donations from both private organizations and individuals to support scientific research and educational activities. Quite recently, the ministry of international trade and industry (MITI-The tsusansho) has started supporting and funding basic research at universities whose results will bring new industries in future.

<P>
<P>In our effort to develop high modulus steel, titanium diboride (TiB2) has proved to be the best reinforcement because of its high Young's modulus and excellent thermodynamic stability in iron-based alloys. In this paper, mechanical properties of the developed steel and the methods applied to practical parts fabrication are discussed. Conventional P/M techniques, including liquid phase sintering to achieve its full density and reaction sintering using low-cost ferroalloy powders, have been successfully utilised. Tensile strength, fatigue strength, and abrasive wear resistance of the developed steel were investigated in order to evaluate its potential application. These mechanical properties revealed a linear improvement with the increase in TiB2 volume fraction. The developed steel also provided hot workability required in die-forging process. Trial forged parts demonstrated a possibility of producing high performance automobile parts.

<P>
<P>This study aims to manufacture A1 alloy composites reinforced by subside size (3 mm, 5mm, 10mm) SiCr with duplex process of squeeze-infiltration (1st process) and squeeze casting (2nd process) developed in this study, to investigate effects of alloying element and heat exposure on the microstructures and heat and wear resistance of A1-Si-X(Cu, Cr, Ni)-SiCr). In the last process, when the melt is infiltrated into SiCr bed. At the same time, melt is flowed to loser part along the gap between mould and SiCr bed. Then, the melt is filtrated into upper-direction conversely. At infiltrating depth of 30-40% into SiCr bed, the vertical lamellar infiltration is appeared heterogeneously due to lack of the melt and increase of viscosity. Although pre-composite fabricated by 1st process has excellent distribution of SiCp on matrix, the SiCp wt% is high as applying industrial articles. Being modelled, the pre-composite and A1 alloy are squeeze casted follow melted, agitated in the caster. Through these processes, SiCp wt% is freely controlled as well as the distribution is increased owing to active plain on SiCp during agitation of the 2nd process. A1-12Si-2Mg-3Cu-SiCp has the least wear loss amount among all the composites manufactured in this study. But, A1-12Si-2Mg-3Ni-SiCp has the lowest relative ratio of wear loss amount (wear loss amount after 350&#176;C, 70hr exposure)-(wear loss amount before 350&#176;C, 70hr exposure)/(wear loss amount before 350&#176;C, 70hr exposure) at high sliding speed. Composites with 15wt%(10mm)SiCp increased the wear amount with the increase of sliding speed because of change abrasive wear to adhesive or melting wear. But composite with 35wt%(10mm SiCp) decreased wear amount with the increase of the sliding speed because abrasive wear with power debris occur in high sliding speed and wear debris with block type occur in low sliding speed.

<P>Recently, particle reinforced A1 alloy matrix composites accomplished weight reduction by utilising A1 alloy matrix and improved wear resistance, heat resistance and mechanical properties. This technique is believed to have advantages compared to the conventional manufacturing process, in that the intermetallic compounds enforcers as well as density and shape of the perform are more easily controlled. In this study, perform composition of 25, 40, 50, 60 and 75at%A1 were manufactured. The perform swelled after the reactive sintering process in the case of 25at%A1 composition. On the other hand, the perform shrinkage in the case of 60at%A1 and 75at%A1 composition. Microstructures of the composite samples squeeze casted at the mould temperature of 500&#176;C and the A1 alloy melt of 610&#176;C were investigated using X-ray diffractometer, energy dispersive spectrometer, micro-vickers hardness and etching experiments. In the case of Fe-25at%A1 and 40at%A1 composites, mixture of the compound and the A1 alloy matrix were observed at the top part of the ingot, whereas small amount of A1 alloy matrix were dispersed within the compound islands at the bottom part. Composite structure were observed throughout the whole sample in the case of 50at%A1, which is the structure initially intended to obtain.

Multicomponent Mg-Y-Cu lightweight alloys were prepared by mechanical alloying of elemental powder mixtures. The progress of alloying, the resulting phases and their thermal stability were characterised by x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA). Coexistent amorphous and nanoscale crystalline phases are found for a variety of alloys with different composition. The thermal stability data of the materials as obtained by constant-rate heating DSC and TMA measurements and isothermal annealing experiments are discussed with respect to phase separation in the undercooled liquid state and nucleation and growth of nanocrystalline phases. Some characteristic properties of the glassy phase are presented and discussed with respect to the composition dependence of the glass transition and the crystalline temperature. The results are compared with data for melt-quenched samples. Finally, the influence of processing conditions and contamination effects during milling on the phase formation and the thermal stability of the mechanically attrited powders is critically assessed.

<P>
A model iron-aluminium system was employed to understand the toughness characteristics observed in multi-layered materials. The process for fabricating laminates by physical vapour deposition using either thermal or electron beam evaporation is described. Laminates are deposited onto a rotating collector and are typically around 2-4mm thick. In this work a range of laminates were fabricated with layer thickness varying from 10nm to 5mm. Microstructural evaluation of the laminates was performed using SEM, XRD, EPMA, and TEM; mechanical property data was generated using tensiles, four-point bend, notched bend, and microhardness. Results show strength and toughness increases are obtained in multi layered materials compared to monolithics primarily due to crack deflection and blunting. The effect of changing layer thickness on the strength and toughness is reported.

<P>
Fe/Al laminates of different layer thicknesses were produced by PVD. TEM studies showed that as deposited microstructure depends on the ratio of the nominal thicknesses of the Fe and Al layers and on the actual layer thickness. For dfe:dal=0.4mm the microstructure consisted of nanocrystals of Fe/Al solid solution with A2 or B2 structure and Al2Fe. For dfe:dAl>>44nm or 2.1mm:0.7mm laminated structures were produced. The laminates consisted of layers of Fe(A2-bcc) and of solid solution of Fe in Al with B2 (ordered bcc) structure which was formed by interdiffusion between the Fe and Al layers. Thermodynamic modelling showed that interdiffusion and interface reaction in the as deposited materials are closely related to the overall heat of mixing. The mechanical properties of the laminates will be related to their microstructures.

PULSED LASER DEPOSITION OF ELECTRONIC CERAMIC THIN FILMS:</B> <I>D.B. Chrisey</I>, J.S. Horwitz, P.C. Dorsey, L.A. Knauss, R.C.Y. Auyeung, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C., 20375-5345<P>
Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a unique physical vapor deposition technique that is making available high quality thin films of complex, multicomponent materials for the design and fabrication of advanced electronic devices and protective coatings. Single phase and epitaxial thin films can be deposited in situ. by PLD. Recent applications of PLD include high temperature superconductors, ferroelectrics, magnetoresistive materials and ferrites. Ferroelectric thin films grown by PLD are currently being developed into low loss, frequency agile microwave electronics which exploit the electric field dependence of the dielectric constant. More recently, colossal magnetoresistance with DRH/RH=0 ~100,000% has been observed in thin films of rare earth manganites deposited by PLD. These materials have applications in magnetic field sensing and recording as well as electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells and room temperature microbolometers. This presentation will show recent examples applying PLD to high quality electronics ceramic thin films growth for next generation devices.

THERMAL BARRIER COATINGS FOR AIRCRAFT ENGINES--A PRATT AND WHITNEY PERSPECTIVE:</B> <I>S. Bose</I>, Pratt and Whitney, 400 Main Street, East Hartford, CT 06108<P>
The gas temperatures in the turbine section of Aircraft Gas Turbine Engines are hundreds of degrees higher than the melting point of the materials of construction. Exposure to such high temperatures would result in structural failure of the materials from a variety of mechanisms. Yet, in modern engines, the components, generally made a nickel and cobalt based superalloys, survive for extended periods of time. This is accomplished by devising efficient air cooling of the components and by applying Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs) to the substrate alloy to reduce metal temperatures to safer levels. Combustor TBCs are processed with air plasma spray (APS) ceramic on APS metallic bond coat. Vanes, exposed to higher temperature and thermal load, require electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) ceramic on FE/A1 laminates of different layer thicknesses were produced by PVD. TEM studies showed that as deposited microstructure depends on the ratio of the nominal thicknesses of the FE and A1 layers and on the actual layer thickness. For dfe:da1=0.4mm the microstructure consisted of nanocrystals of Fe/A1 solid solution with A2 or B2 structure and A13Fe. For dfe:dA1&#187;44nm or 2.1mm:0.7mm laminated structures were produced. The laminates consisted of layers of Fe(A2-bcc) and of solid solution of Fe in A1 with B2 (ordered bcc) structure which was formed by interdiffusion between the Fe and A1 layers. Thermodynamic modelling showed that interdiffusion and interface reaction in the as deposited materials are closely related to the overall heat of mixing. The mechanical properties of the laminates will be related to their microstructures low pressure plasma spray (LPPS) bond coat. These TBCs have allowed the components to be operated at high gas path temperatures to meet thrust, efficient and life requirements of Pratt and Whitney's gas turbine engines. Details of Pratt and Whitney's experience on various aspects of TBCs will be discussed.

ANALYSIS OF THERMAL SPRAY METHOD FOR COATING NANOSCALE MATERIALS: </B> <I>Schmuel Eidelman, </I>Xiaolong Yang, Science Applications International Corporation, 1710 Goodridge Drive, McLean, VA<P>
Thermal Spray (TS) system allows delivery of the plating materials to the substrates at high velocities (on the order of 1 to 1.5 km/sec) and high temperatures. The total pressure of the particle impinging on the surface can reach 10 Gpa for some of the TS systems. Lower sintering temperatures and higher ductility of nanoscale materials open a range of attractive and unique possibilities for high rate deposition of nanostructured coatings. We use a recently developed and validated three dimensional simulation capability to model the TS systems' gas and coating powder flow for the TS process analysis, to illustrate the roots of currently used TS systems' inefficiencies, and to optimize and control the coating process. Examples are given for the TS process designs with improved performance and system efficiency. The use of numerical simulation will be especially crucial for the plating with nanoscale powders.

ROLE OF INTERDIFFUSION AND HEAT TREATMENTS ON THE ADHESION OF PLASMA SPRAYED NiCrAlY COATINGS:</B> <I>C.S. Richard</I>, G.

During service blades and vanes of stationary gas turbines are subject to different kinds of loadings like mechanical and thermal stresses as well as corrosion, oxidation and erosion. Against these phenomena, plasma spraying coatings are frequently used to protect the componenets in the hot parts of these engines. The layers are commonly deposited by Atmospheric Plasma Spraying (APS) and by Vacuum Plasma Spraying (VPS). One of the main parameters in quality of a coating is its adhesion on a Ni-based superalloy substrate. This study focused on a NiCrAlY metallic bonding layer and its adhesion on a Ni-based supralloy substrate. It looks at the influence of different spraying methods (APS and VPS) and the influence of a post heat treatment on the adhesion of the coatings. In order to determine the interface toughness, a Vickers interfacial indentation test, based on fracture mechanics method, was performed. In APS and VPS cases, the residual stresses were evaluated by a step-by-step drilling method and these were taken into account in the adhesion parameters. The results were supplemented by a microstructural study of the interface in order to understand the role of interdiffusion on adhesion.

Hot-dip galvannealed steel sheet has been increasingly used in the automotive industry and more recently it has been found that a zinc-iron alloy steel sheet, such as galvannealed would provide even better results. The galvannealed steel sheet is a product with good corrosion resistance, weldability and paintability. Therefore it has been used in the automotive and appliance industries. The properties of galvannealed steel are strongly influenced by the iron content of the coating, especially galling, corrosion resistance, welding and powdering. The galvannealed steel is predominately composed of delta phase. When the soft zeta phase is present in the surface of the coating, it adheres to the die and reduces the performance of steel sheet during deformation. When the hard and brittle gamma phase is at the interface steel-coating , the galvannealed coating fails by powdering. In this work we discuss the formation of Fe-Zn intermetallic compounds in the industrial galvannealed coating.

RECENT TRENDS IN ELECTROPLATING:</B> <I>Brian Am Manty</I>, Concurrent Technologies Corporation, Johnstown, PA<P>
This paper reports on recent trends and advances in electroplating as a surface finishing technology. It includes a description of environment and worker exposure regulations that have affected the industry. New developments in water and chemical recycling equipment and techniques have substantially reduced the amount of wastes generated during electroplating. Near-zero discharges are now technically and economically feasible for many electroplating shops. Several guidance documents are available to help electroplaters reduce wastes with simple, inexpensive techniques. Alternative electroplating processes and materials are also being developed for processes requiring the use of toxic materials. On-going programs within industry and the government are aimed at reducing the use of cadmium, chromium (hexavalent), lead and cyanide. There is a substantial increase in commercial formulations for alloy electrodeposits, especially where those alloys may be used as a substitute for more toxic coatings.

STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF FUNCTIONALLY THICK CHROMIUM ELECTRODEPOSITS FROM A TRIVALENT ELECTROLYTE - A &quot; GREEN &quot; TECHNOLOGY:</B> <I>Christian E. Johnson</I>, Jasper L. Mullen National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg MD 20899<P>
Chromium is widely used as an electrochemically applied coating on metal for wear resistance, to reduce friction, or for a desired appearance. In present commercial electroplating processes, the chromium is deposited from electrolytes in which it is in the hexavalent state. With recent interest in seeking alternatives to the toxic Cr6+, a process has been developed to deposit thick chromium coatings from a non-toxic trivalent electrolyte. The coatings deposited from this electrolyte are an alloy of chromium-carbon-oxygen-hydrogen having an amorphous structure, as-deposited. However, with heat treatment they are transformed to a crystalline structure of chromium carbide in a chromium matrix. The hardness and resistance to wear increase with the transformation of this coating after heat treatment. The structure of the electrodeposited coatings, will be discussed. Property measurements of microhardness, wear and coefficient of thermal expansion will be discussed for the as-deposited and heat treated coatings.

COPING WITH UNINTENDED Cu ENRICHMENT DURING CONVERSION COATING OF MICROSTRUCTURALLY COMPLEX ALUMINUM:</B> <I>R.G. Buchheit</I>, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM 87185
<P>
Copper is a major alloying element in engineering aluminum alloys. Cu is concentrated in second phase particles distributed throughout the alloy. The interaction of these particles with conversion coating solutions can result in enrichment of Cu on the treated surface. This enrichment has serious negative consequences on subsequent corrosion and adhesion properties. Direct examination using high resolution SEM shows that in 2024-T# Cu is segregated into large (2-6 micrometer) Al2CuMg particles. During surface finishing these particles experience severe dealloying and produce a fine dispersion of Cu-rich clusters that are distributed across the alloy surface facilitating galavanic corrosion during testing or service. Since redistribution of Cu across the surface is possible without ever oxidizing the Cu, mitigation schemes based on Cu complexing agent additions alone may be inadequate. However, mitigation schemes that utilize a Cu complexing agent and a sufficiently oxidizing solution can successfully prevent Cu enrichment and produce significant improvements in corrosion resistance.

Fiber-reinforced titanium aluminide composites are of particular interest as candidate materials for aerospace structural applications at moderately high temperatures. Conventional techniques for fabrication of these composites pose many technical challenges, and serve as one of the barriers to the practical use of these composite systems. The present work deals with a novel vapor synthesis route, the matrix-coated fiber process, for producing Ti-alloy metal matrix composites (MMCs). In this process, the matrix alloy is directly deposited on continuous SiC fibers by hollow-cathode magnetron sputtering. The matrix-coated fibers are then consolidated to produce unidirectionally reinforced MMC panels. Details of the processing technique will be presented, along with results on microstructural evolution. Results from room-temperature mechanical evaluation of the MMC specimens will also be presented. This research is funded by the U.S. Air Force as a Small Business Innovative Research Program under Contract No. F33615-94-C-5214 . Program Monitor: Dr. Stephen W.

COMBUSTION CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (CCVD) OF LaPO4 MONAZITE ON ALUMINA FIBERS FOR CERAMIC MATRIX COMPOSITES:</B> T.J. Hwang, M.R. Hendrick, H. Shao, H.G. Hornis, A.T. Hunt, Micro Coating Technologies, 430 Tenth Street, Suite N-108, Atlanta, GA 30318<P>
It has been demonstrated that monazite compounds can serve as an oxidation protection and crack deflecting interface coatings to improve the strength and toughness in oxide-oxide ceramic matrix composite. In this study, lanthanum phosphate LaPO4 (monatize) was coated on alumina fibers (Nextel 610) using the combustion chemical vapor deposition (CCVDSM) method in the open atmosphere. This study has shown that the CCVD is feasible for applying a dense LaPO4 coating while moving the fiber tows through the deposition zone. A systematic stoichiometry study showed that monazite was the predominate phase in the film. Deposition temperatures were controlled to prevent degradation of fibers while maintaining an optimal deposition rate and coating quality. Several interlayer materials were investigated to minimize the reaction and recrystallization of the A12O3 fibers. Since a vacuum chamber is not required for the CCVD process, large scale, continuous coating of fibers is possible.

DENSE TITANIUM MATRIX COMPOSITE MONOTAPE FROM E-BEAM METAL COATED FIBERS:</B> Herve Deve, Metal Matrix Composites Program, 3M Center, Bldg 60-1N-01, St Paul, MN 55144-1000<P>
The high temperature specific strength and stiffness of titanium matrix composites (TMC's) make them very attractive for the next generation of jet engine components. Significant efforts are now underway at 3M to reduce the cost of TMC's; bring them to a production status; and offer the customer a TMC precursor that will be easy to integrate into titanium components. The recent advances in the production of metal coated fibers by electron beam evaporation have allowed the development of continuous dense monotape. Dense TMC monotape will facilitate the fabrication of complex curved parts such as rings. A dense monotape is a single composite ply made by roll-bonding cylindrical metal coated fibers. Continuous roll-bonding allows the low-cost fabrication of TMC tape that do not contain organic binders. Monotapes have been produced that are typically 200 =B5m thick by 10 mm wide and greater than 30 meter long. The flexible composite tape can be easily laid-up on flat or curved parts. Final bonding of the component requires a HIP or diffusion bonding cycle without the complex removal of organic binders. TMC rings with a nearly perfect fiber distribution were fabricated to illustrate the simplicity of use of TMC monotapes.

REACTIVE SPRAY ATOMIZATION AND DEPOSITION OF ALUMINUM ALLOYS: MODELING DISPERSOID VOLUME FRACTION AND SIZE DISTRIBUTION:</B> J.-P. Delplanque, E.J. Lavernia, R.H. Rangel, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of California, Irvine, California 92697-2575<P>
Reactive spray atomization and deposition combines atomization, chemical reaction and consolidation into a single step. It offers a unique opportunity for in-situ, continuous control over alloy composition and chemical reaction between atomized droplets and reactive atomization gas. During reactive spray deposition a molten alloy is atomized by using a reactive gas mixture. The atomized droplets are subsequently deposited on a substrate. Chemical reactions occur between the matrix material and the reactive gas during both atomization and deposition. By carefully selecting alloying additive and reactive gas combinations on the basis of containing in-situ dispersoids such as carbides, nitrides, and oxides, leading to grain refinement. The volume frac
 tion and the size distribution of the dispersoids is critical to the grain refinement mechanisms. The primary goal of the present work is to define a model to estimate these characteristics. The materials considered are aluminum alloys while target dispersoids are primarily oxides. These may be obtained by the reaction of oxygen containing atomization gas mixtures with molten alloy droplets or with minor alloy additives which exhibit a high affinity for oxygen. Droplet position and velocity histories are obtained from the numerical solution of the one-dimensional equation of motion. The energy equation inside the droplet is solved numerically using finite-differences to predict the spatially resolved temperature field. The solid/liquid interface progression rate is estimated using a power law. The effect of the dispersiods on the achievable undercooling is included. This model is then used to determine the parameters controlling the volume fraction and the size distribution of the dispersiods.

PLASMA SPRAYED MULTI-LAYERED AND FUNCTIONALLY GRADED MATERIALS:</B> <I>H. Herman</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY 11794<P>
Multi-layered (MLM) and functionally graded (FGM) composites display discrete or continuously varying compositions of metals, ceramics and polymers and/or microstructures over definable geometrical orientations and distances. Plasma spray offers a flexible and economic means for producing non-uniform composites and is used to apply layered and graded deposits to enhance the survivability of thick ceramic coatings (e.g., TBCs). These &quot;graded coatings&quot; are primarily applied to reduce CTE mismatch-related failure. The versatility of plasma spray allows the processing of a wide range of high performance materials, including most metals and refractory ceramics, under a controlled atmosphere if desired. Using plasma spray, it is possible to deposit multiple constituents simultaneously, thus providing a unique means of producing FGMs. Plasma spray MLM/FGM production will be discussed and the characteristics and properties of two FGM systems, Ni-Al2O3 and NiCrAlY-ZrO2, will be presented. This research is supported by NIST-Caterpillar Advanced Technology Program and the INEL University Research Consortium.

SOL-GEL SYNTHESIS OF CERAMIC MATRIX COMPOSITES:</B> E.D. Rodeghiero, <I>E.P. Giannelis</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853<P>
Sol-gel techniques provided new and powerful means by which to synthesize oxide-based ceramic matrix composites. The advantages of sol-gel approaches relative to conventional powder processing are numerous. First, sol-gel synthesis can achieve extremely fine (nanoscale) microstructures with high degrees of dispersion between the matrix and reinforcement phases. In addition, the chemical compositions of the various phases can be precisely controlled. Furthermore, gel-derived composites are also highly uniform, as a result of eliminating powder mixing and segregation problems. Finally, sol-gel synthesis can reduce consolidation temperatures significantly, leading to more efficient, economical processing. This talk will present the results of our work in synthesizing both Ni/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">-Al2O3 metal-ceramic composites and SiC(whisker)/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">-Al2O3 ceramic-ceramic composites.

The formation of an AlN/Polyimide (PI) nanocomposite was achieved by the rapid solidification of the precursor suspension, followed by compression molding. Such an approach for nanocomposites exhibits improved homogeneity with ultrafine fillers and allows a tailorable composition and property at the nanoscale level. AlN/PI nanocomposites with an increased ceramic loading up to 50% by volume were attained and their thermal and mechanical properties, along with the compositional effects, were investigated.

REDUCTION OF THE MOISTURE CONTENT IN MRN BAUXITE, BY TREATMENT WITH DEWATERING AID:</B> <I>Carlos Estevam da Silva</I>, Marcos Fernando Dias Moreira, Minerac&atilde;o Rio do Norte S.A. , Porto Trombetas, PA 68275-000 Brazil; Luis Gustavo Esteves Pereira, Mauro Pinto dos Reis, Nalco Brasil Ltda, Av. das Nac&otilde;es Unidas, 17891 - 11o.

MRN must sell their bauxite at a maximum of 12% moisture content to avoid paying a penalty. To meet this target it is necessary to mix dried and wet bauxite; however, that mixing is very costly because of the high drying cost. Thus MRN and NALCO BRASH have worked together to develop a chemical program to reduce the moisture content of wet bauxite. A large number of dewatering aid products were tested on a lab scale. Two products were selected and tried in pilot plant scale. Finally the product 95DW121 was selected and tried on an industrial scale. The industrial trial was run for three months in the fine and superfine plants with the results that the bauxite moisture was reduced around three percentage points with a dosage rate of 80 g/t.

Routine elemental analysis of the major and minor oxides in alumina-bearing minerals, using modern XRF instrumentation yields better than 0.1% reproducibility at a rate exceeding 100 samples per day. However, the mineralogy required to evaluate the amount of recoverable alumina or other Bayer plant parameters has been far less readily accessible. Empirical fits between elemental composition and simulated plant digests are limited to narrow composition ranges in particular geological deposits. Interpretation of X-ray diffractograms is notoriously slow, influenced by crystallite size, amorphous phases, and preferred orientation effects. Instead, using non-linear programming, the BQUANT software provides quantitative phase analysis based on an elemental mass balance. It can even deal with overburden, clay bottoms and is independent of the exact nature of the geological deposit. Given its rapidity, it is particularly useful for estimating the potential of new deposits. Given its accuracy, it greatly facilitates mine exploitation control.

The ALUMAR Refinery was designed to maximize heat recovery, and therefore minimize process steam requirements. Since the increase of alumina production from 0.5 to 1.2 million tons per year, the heat exchangers became a strategic point in the refinery performance. An objective has been to create a tool to improve the performance of the heaters. A continuous method of monitoring individual heaters was developed of calculating the scaling factor using the principles of the heat transfer theory. This paper describes the method and the steps to achieve a significant improvement in the identification and troubleshooting of heat transfer related problems. This method also proved to have a positive effect on the operation and maintenance planning of the heat exchangers in the refining.

THE PRECIPITATION MECHANISM OF SODIUM ALUMINOSILICATE SCALE IN BAYER PLANTS:</B> <I>J. Addai-Mensah</I>, A.R. Gerson, K. Zheng, A. O'dea, R. St. C. Smart, Ian Wark Research Institute, University of South Australia, The Levels, Adelaide, 5095, Australia<P>
During the dissolution of bauxite ores by caustic soda, a serious and unwanted downstream precipitation of sodium aluminosilicate may occur in heat exchangers, due to the presence of silica impurity dissolved in the Bayer liquor. To date, the mechanism of nucleation and growth of scale occurring on heat transfer surfaces is not fully known. This paper presents the results from studies carried out to investigate the mechanism of formation of sodium aluminosilicate scale on metallic surfaces under conditions close to those in alumina refineries. It is shown that the scale formation may involve two aluminosilicate dimorphs: sodalite and cancrinite. The extent of solution desilication and scale growth was observed to be strongly temperature and carbonate impurity concentration dependent.

The formation of hydrogarnet (CAS) with low solubility is the essence of desilication of the sodium aluminate solutions with lime addition. The mechanisms of formation of hydrogarnet were studied. It is indicated that desilication with formation CAS is in a form of SCM-type model, i.e. the unreacted core model for spherical particles of unchanging size.

A STUDY OF DESILICATION OF ALUMINATE SOLUTION WITH HCAC</B> <I>: Peng Zhihong</I>, Li Xiaobin, Department of Metallurgy, Central South University of Technology, Changsha, Hunan, 410083, China<P>
Because the sintering process is very important in the Chinese alumina industry, it is important to understand and improve on desilication of aluminate solutions from the sintering process. This paper presents a thorough study on a new method of desilication utilizing HCAC (4CaO&#183;Al2O3&#183;mCO2&#183;mH2O) both in theory and practice. The reaction thermodynamics and kinetics study reveal the reaction laws during synthesis of HCAC and desilication with HCAC. All levels of tests and applications indicate that the desilication effect of HCAC is superior to lime. It can achieve lower silica concentrations in the purified solution under the same amount of lime addition. At the same target silica concentration it can decrease the amount of lime addition about 44% and reduce the loss of alumina about 30%. The new method has achieved satisfactory results in the plant after replacing the old method of desilication with lime in Shangdong Aluminium Corporation. It sets a new path for sintering processes in China by improving alumina product quality, decreasing energy consumption, and raising the target of technology and economy.

From the 18th of June 1995 to the 21st of June 1996, Alusaf Hillside Smelter started the 576 AP30 reduction pots of its two potlines. The promising results achieved by the first stabilized pots allowed the Process management team to finely tune the potlines around 310 kA and to achieve current efficiency in excess of 95.5% and energy consumption very close to 13000 kWh/t during the first half of 1996. The results of these first 6 months of operation of the first full potline are discussed. It includes data on the raw materials, the organisation and the training programs of the Reduction Department which were all instrumental in engineering this success. The evolution of the Reduction Process parameters and results described in the paper will be updated for the final presentation with the available data of both potlines.

Modernization of the 210,000 tpy VAW Rheinwerk smelter includes installation of point feeder, alumina conveying system, state-of-the-art pot control system and forsees an increase in amperage of up to 175 kA. For the modernized pots, concepts for the potlining as well as for improvements of the busbar system were developed, based solely on computer simulations. For the layout of the potlining a new three-dimensional thermoelectric cell model was applied that allows prediction of side ledge countours as well as heat and voltage balances. Based on this model the choice of semi-graphitic vs. fully graphitized cathode blocks was evaluate with respect to the anticipated increase in system amperage. Temperature fields and side ledge contours predicted are in good agreement with measurements. The busbar system, designed originally for a current load of 110 kA, was improved in a very efficient manner to cope with the higher amperage. Magneto-hydrodynamic simulations predicted and plant measurements demonstrated significant improvements in cell stability and performance.

<P>
Construction, start-up and operation of ten retrofitted 165 kA prebaked pilot cells in the Rheinwerk smelter are described. The excellent performance of these pots led to the DM 40 Mill. investment decision to retrofit all three potlines. The hot-change of cells during full potline operation minimizes production losses. The pilot cells are equipped with improved steel shells and lining, modified busbar system and modern pot controller and point-feeding system. To evaluate the most cost-effective solution with best performance, four cells are provided with two point feeders and six cells with three point feeders. The new-developed VAW-ELAS process controlling system with improved algorithms and a user-friendly graphical interface allows system atic surveillance and interpretation of all pot parameters and has a major contribution to the highly improved pot performance.

DEVELOPMENT OF A 200 kA REDUCTION CELL TECHNOLOGY - CD200:</B> <I>Geoff Bearne</I>, Mark Dunn, Comalco Research Centre, P.O.

<P>
In 1990, Comalco and Dubai Aluminium Co. Ltd. (Dubai) joined forces to develop a modern high amperage reduction cell design known as the CD200. This technology was aimed at the 190 to 200 kA operating range. It was designed to be compatible with future expansion plans at Dubai as well as at the Comalco managed New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Ltd. (NZAS) plant, while remaining within the scope of the present anode design. The cell incorporated a cathode lining design and alumina feeding technology which had been successfully demonstrated at NZAS. The bus bar system was developed using computer modelling at the Comalco Research Centre (CRC). Dubai provided the financial investment and operational experience as well as improvements in process control strategies. Five cells were installed in Dubai's potline 4 and these have operated since 1991. During the last five years, there have been changes to the bus bar design and cathode lining, introduction of larger anodes and further enhancements of the process control systems and operating practices. As a result, the operational performance and the power efficiency of the prototype cells have met or exceeded all targets. Subsequently, the technology has been selected for expansions at both NZAS and Dubai. NZAS has installed 48 cells to be operated at 190 kA, with commissioning from mid 1996. 2 is installing 240 cells to be operated at 195 kA, with start up scheduled in September 1996.

ELECTRIC POWER CONTRACTS AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING SMELTER ECONOMICS:</B> <I>Nolan E. Richards,</I> 117 Kingswood Dri., Florence, AL 35630; Helge O. Forberg, 8A Quail Ridge Court, Owensboro, KY 42303<P>
The cost of electric power for smelters varies from less than 15% to more than 35% of operating costs. For a smelter with a high power rate, it becomes important to obtain a premium in the market for finished products, produce a higher proportion of premium grade metal, increase volume supplemented with purchased scrap, reduce other cost factors or negotiate a power contract that would allow power modulation. The large difference in cost of power demand between a peak period, normally between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m., and the no-peak period can give some smelters the opportunity to negotiate advantageous contracts for reductions in demand of 20-30% during the peak period. Provided the smelter can implement the changes necessary in the operating procedures to maintain control of potroom operations during the modulations, the decreased power rate can have a substantial beneficial affect on the plant's economics. Some of the strategies and major changes which could be considered for a reduction plant to improve economics are discussed in this paper.

CAPACITY CREEP - THE HIDDEN POTENTIAL GROWTH OF ALUMINIUM SMELTING CAPACITY:</B> <I>K. J. Driscoll</I>, CRU International, Ltd., London WC1X 0AD, England<P>

Given the lack of firm expansion plans for aluminium smelting capacity over the next few years, many people are expecting a smelter bottleneck to develop towards the end of the century. However, CRU believes that a potential source of capacity growth, which we call &quot;capacity creep&quot;, is being ignored. As well as new greenfield and brownfield expansions which might fill the new capacity requirements, incremental production gains at existing smelters can be achieved through lower cost upgrades or improvements in operational efficiencies. Indeed, we believe that such capacity creep has historically added around 0.50-0.75% per year to industry capacity, although many of these capacity increases remain undocumented. This paper will present the results of an extensive study of the potential for growth in aluminium smelting capacity, in which we will review how and where capacity creep has occurred, and show that the potential for further capacity creep remains substantial.

Managing an aluminium plant within a concurrential environment demands a greater use of leading edge technology. This technology is of course related to the smelting process but also deals with the organisation scheme and the information provided. During the engineering phase and the construction phase of the Alusaf smelter, Aluminium Pechiney has provided Alusaf with the AP30 technology and has elaborated an organisation with its SA partner. The design and the construction of the information systems have been done in partnership between AP and Alusaf. The information system is based on the use of the state-of-the-art technology and more important is really designed to fit the organisation and to evolve with it. It is built using the 4 classic levels of the CIM model. It takes advantage of packages as SAP R/3 and Microsoft Office Suite tools for routine processes and uses specific developments defined by AP and is used by Alusaf to implement value-adding processes.

USE OF IMAGING PYROMETRY SENSOR IN METALLURGICAL PROCESSES:</B> <I>C. Lorenson</I>, Quadtek, 14737 NE 87th St., Redmond, WA 98052<P>
The Spyrometer imaging pyrometer brings a new dimension of imaging capabilities to temperature measurement technology by combining a high temperature video camera with scanning optical pyrometry. This gives operators the ability to observe process conditions while measuring the temperature of virtually any object or region in the field of view. Since the lens tube of the camera can be air or water cooled, it is possible to insert the optical lens tube inside furnaces giving very good view of many different types of metallurgical processes. Specific benefits in process knowledge and maintenance tasks for electric arc melting furnaces, anode furnace and casting wheels, flash smelters, reheat furnaces, and torpedo ladles in different types of metal industries will be discussed.

We have developed a novel method, using X-ray photons and computed tomography (CT), for distinguishing the solidification front in metal casting processes directly and nondestructively. Depending on the metal, the density of the liquid and solid phases may differ anywhere from 4 to 12%. Computed tomography provides an excellent means of mapping this density difference into a two- or three-dimensional image. Using a Co60 radioisotope and a NaI scintillation detector, CT image reconstruction was performed on pure tin metal in a two-phase state. In addition, CT image reconstruction was done using a 6 MeV linear accelerator and CdWO4 scintillation detector array on pure and alloyed aluminum metals while they underwent solidification. As the speed of the data acquisition and image reconstruction improves, this sensor technology offers the possibility of real-time performance and eventual feedback control for the metal casting process.

LASER ULTRASONIC SENSING OF SOLID-LIQUID INTERFACES DURING BRIDGMAN SINGLE CRYSTAL GROWTH:</B> <I>H.N.G. Wadley</I>, Y. Lu, D.T. Queheillalt, Intelligent Processing of Materials Laboratory, School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903<P>
Using a 3-D ray tracing methodology combined with laser ultrasonically measured elastic constant data near the melting point, ultrasonic propagation in cylindrical single crystal bodies containing either a convex or a concave solid-liquid interface have been simulated and used to design new sensing concepts. Ray paths, wavefronts, and time of flight (TOF) of rays that travel from a source to an arbitrarily positioned receiver have been calculated. Experimentally measured TOF data have been collected using laser generated/detected ultrasound on model systems with independently known interface shapes. Both numerically simulated data and experimental results have shown that the solidification (interfacial) region can be identified from ultrasonic transmission TOF data. Ultrasonic sensing in the diametral plane is the preferred sensing configuration. Since convex and concave solid-liquid interfaces result in distinctively different TOF data profiles, the interface shape (convex or concave) can be readily determined from the TOF data. When TOF data collected in the diametral plane are used in a nonlinear least squares algorithm, the interface curvature has been successfully reconstructed and ultrasonic velocities of both the solid and liquid obtained, the reconstruction errors were found to be less than 5%.

EDDY CURRENT SENSORS FOR MONITORING THE NUCLEATION AND GROWTH OF Cd0.96Zn0.04Te BULK CRYSTALS:</B> Haydn N.G. Wadley, <I>K.P. Dharmasena</I>, Bill W. Choi, Intelligent Processing of Materials Laboratory, School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903<P>
Non-contact eddy current sensing methods have been developed and applied to Cd0.96Zn0.04Te crystal growth to obtain a better understanding of the melt, solid nucleation, and the growth process. The application of this sensor approach relies on a large difference in liquid and solid electrical conductivities near the melting point and requires knowledge of the relationships between the electrical conductivity, melt composition, and temperature. Using a multi-frequency encircling eddy current sensor, the electrical conductivities of three different Cd1-yZnyTe (y = 0.00, 0.045, and 0.08) alloys were measured as a function of temperature in a laboratory-scale vertical Bridgman furnace. The measured solid and liquid electrical conductivities were then used in electro-magnetic finite element models to analyze the multifrequency responses of eddy current sensor designs during the simulated growth of a crystal. Three eddy current sensors were fabricated and installed in a vertical Bridgman furnace and used to monitor many Cd0.96Zn0.04Te growth runs One sensor was placed in the vicinity of the ampoule tip to detect undercooling/spontaneous nucleation and two other sensors (&quot;absolute&quot; and &quot;differential&quot; designs) placed to monitor the movement/curvature of the liquid-solid interface during crystal growth. The sensor data was used to characterize the initial melt state, detect the onset of nucleation, determine the growth velocity, and identify the shape of the interface.

ADVANCES IN SENSING COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTOR CRYSTAL GROWTH:</B> <I>J.P. Wallace</I>, Casting Analysis Corp., RT 2 BOX 113, Weyers Cave, VA 24486<P>
Monitoring compound semiconductor crystal growth using multifrequency eddy currents for sensing illustrates some of the extreme problems of measurement and interpretation of that are not often seen in metallic systems monitored through solidification. Using sensor arrays and scanning have produced a qualitative and quantitative basis for understanding some of the high temperature electrical conductivity mechanisms. The implications of these measurements of electrical conductivity variations are important in that they reflect the complex states of stress that will occur on cooling and heat treating following crystal growth. In particular, for the CdTe and the CdZnTe system, the measurements provide some proof of where the changes in majority defect types occur. The complex nature of the melt and the cooling solid coupled with the growth interface data provide a basis for analyzing the major events during growth and cool down.

Refinements in sensor design have produced low-cost rugged elements acting as loops coupled with stable detection hardware. This has allowed direct dimensional gauging of nonferrous and ferrous products above the curie point for absolute dimensions and electrical conductivities independently. The software was developed for the analysis of electrical conductivity profiles in CZ silicon crystal growth, then refined for the monitoring of bar properties, and then tube properties. Since in most metal working operations, speeds at the minimum of a few hundred feet per minute are encountered, the design of the gauge was optimized for a rapid measurement. Independently extracting electrical conductivity provides data in some metal system for determining the temperature of the monitored product. Applications in ferrous heat treatment will be discussed.

A coherent FM laser radar based sensor is being developed for remote metrology of plasma facing material surfaces in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The sensor is capable of three-dimensional mapping of the surface under examination, based on a series of precise range measurements. Sub-millimeter accuracy at large ranges (15 m) has been achieved. Other features that are being incorporated include the ability to operate under adverse environmental conditions involving a combination of very high gamma radiation (3x106 rad/h), ultra-high-vacuum (&lt;10-7 torr), and high temperature (200&#176;C). The paper will describe the basic principles of the sensor, together with experimental results obtained with the sensor.

THE USE OF FRACTAL DIMENSION WITH AN AGGREGATION MODEL TO CHARACTERISE COPPER ELECTRODEPOSITION IN THE PRESENCE OF THIOUREA: </B> S.P. Fox, S.A. Godorr, A.W. Bryson, School of Process and Materials Engineering, Private Bag 3, Wits 2050, South Africa
<P>
This work is an extension of a previous investigation on the development of surface roughness during electrodeposition of copper. A comprehensive model based on diffusion and migration in a force field together with surface diffusion and sticking probabilities is used to generate profiles which are compared to those produced experimentally. The roughness is characterized by using the technique of fractal geometry which is shown to describe both qualitatively and quantitatively the development of surface morphology during electrodeposition. The work is extended to the deposition of copper in the presence of various concentrations of thiourea. The development of roughness is observed experimentally on the edge of a thin copper disc mounted between two glass plates. This enables photographs to be taken at various stages during growth. The surface outline is digitized using an image analyzer which enables the fractal dimension to be determined as growth proceeds. As expected the presence of thiourea at low concentrations produces a fractal dimension which is closer to unity (i.e. the surface becomes smoother). The original model is modified to include diffusion and migration of thiourea to the surface. It is postulated that the presence of thiourea on a surface site changes the sticking probability of discharged copper ions at this site. This results in increased surface diffusion of the copper, which in turn produces a smoother deposit. Extensive experimental results are presented which show that the model adequately predicts the effect of changes in thiourea concentrations over a wide range of conditions including those that are of relevance in electrorefining practice.

DIRECT RECOVERY OF METALS FROM LOADED ORGANIC SOLVENTS: A REVIEW OF RECENT METHODOLOGIES: </B> L.M. Abrantes, A.P. Paiva, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ci&ecirc;ncias, Departamento de Quimica, Lisboa, Portugal<P>
The application of hydrometallurgical methods to the recovery of metal values from ores and concentrates has been receiving a growing interest, either from researchers or from the mining industry. For the concentration/purification of the relatively low concentrated metallic solutions resulting form the leaching of those raw materials, a well established technique often used is solvent extraction (SX); the loaded organic solvent is then conventionally contacted with a suitable aqueous medium, the metal in its final form being usually recovered form this solution by electrowinning. Methods dealing with the direct stripping of metals from loaded organic extractants have recently been investigated, as an efficient stripping is sometimes difficult to achieve for some solvents. Amongst these innovating processes, the electroreductive stripping (2-phase electrolysis) and cementation (galvanic stripping) must be emphasized, the related research works being cautiously reviewed in the present paper. Particularly, the possibility of use of a 2 phase electrolysis to recover basic and precious metals is more extensively discussed. Examples are given for the recovery of copper and silver from suitable organic media, namely by direct application of an electrical potential to a mixture of a silver loaded organic phase containing Cyanex 471X - obtained by SX - and a stabilized sodium thiosulfate solution. The overall efficiencies of these one-step techniques are analyzed and compared with the results obtained by conventional stripping procedures. The purity of the cathodic deposits is also considered. The recovery of silver by galvanic stripping involving iron and zinc powders is also preliminarly evaluated, using a similar organic solution as described above. The influence of temperature on the efficiency of the process is also studied, either for concentrated or more diluted organic silver solutions. The literature data and the results reported here on the application of both methods for direct metal recovery from organic phases show promising advantages over the conventional procedures, encouraging a research effort to optimize and establish these alternative processes.

Gold electrodeposition experiments were realized using an electrolysis cell, provided by a rotary disk of vitreous carbon and or platinum counter electrode of platinum mesh and reference electrode. Using an automatic measurement system voltammograms and Nyquist faradaic impedance spectra were obtained. In this paper, responses for different cases were analyzed through faradaic impedance criteria, considering several kinds of diagrams obtained. The importance diffusion influence of aurocyanide ions and adsorption as controlling steps previous charge transfer was verified. A model of proposed mechanism is discussed.

AN INVESTIGATION ON GOLD ELECTROWINNING FROM ACIDIC THIOUREA SOLUTIONS: </B> C.M. Juarez, A.J.B. Dutra, Federa University of Rio de Janeiro, Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil<P>
The use of thiourea as a gold leaching reagent has been extensively studied by many researchers, and it has proved to be promising for some cases as refractory gold ores and electronic gold scraps. Otherwise, the recovery of gold from these solutions did not receive so much attention. In this paper, the electrowinning of gold in acidic thiourea solutions was studied by voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance in a conventional three-electrode cell with a rotating disc electrode. These electrochemical techniques can provide valuable kinetic information to electrowinning practice. Results have shown that gold electrowinning should be carried out at low current densities in order to avoid cathode passivation and side reactions, as formamidine disulfide reduction and hydrogen evolution at higher overpotentials.

<B>ELECTROCHEMICAL ASPECTS OF THE DISSOLUTION OF GOLD IN CYANIDE ELECTROLYTES CONTAINING LEAD: </B> D. Mussatti, J. Mager , G.P. Martins, Colorado School of Mines, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Golden, CO 80401<P>
The role of lead (Pb), at low concentrations in high pH cyanide electrolytes, on the dissolution behaviour of gold has now been a topic of scientific and industrial concern for over 50 years. The recent paper by Kondos et al at CANMET (1995) attests to this continuing interest and apparent importance. Nevertheless, the mechanism(s) by which this (and other heavy metal) component influences the electrodics of this electrochemical system has still not been unequivocally demonstrated. Instead, several plausible hypothesis, by pioneering researchers in this field, have been advanced and reiterated over the ensuing years. While it is generally accepted, based on electrode potential calculations, that co-reduction of lead on the gold surface may occur due to cementation (contact reduction) the cemented lead has never been characterized. The subject matter is confounded further when sulfide (or hydrosulfide) species are also a consitutent of the electrolyte. The work to be presented re-
 examines the role of lead and sulfide in this system, by considering the species distribution of these components and by conducting potentiodynamic studies in conjunction with surface analyses of a gold (and lead) electrode.

STUDY ON WASTEWATER TREATMENT OF CHEMICAL PLATING SOLUTION USING RECOVERING PROCESSES: </B> Y.

Souza, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, Belo Horizonte, Brazil<P>
Electroless plating processes or chemical deposition processes, have been used in many fields such as automobile and electronic industries. These solutions must be disposed or treated even when the components already have high performance and concentrations. Commonly, in these kind of solution among others components, metal ions are in very high concentrations. The cost of the plating process becomes higher and is very difficult to keep the environmental regulations. The main objective of this study was to investigate the ways to recover the bath components, among them, the metal ion, in order to decrease the cost of the process as well as to meet the environmental regulations. Specifically, in this study was investigated the way to recover, from the exhausted bath, the nickel ion, sulfate ion, phosphite ion and organic compounds. In this case, was investigated a solution for electroless for nickel deposition. The metal ion was recovered from the wastewater by chemical plating onto mica powder surface. The phosphite and sulfate ions were recovered from the wastewater by precipitation as calcium salts. The organic acids were recovered by solvent extraction. These recovery process, used for the metal ion, is particularly important because many studies are investigating the use of mica coated with metal in the development of new composite materials.

THE EVALUATION OF FOAMING BEHAVIOUR OF SURFACTANTS FOR ACID MIST CONTROL IN METAL ELECTROLYSIS PROCESSES: </B> A.M. Alfantazi, D.B.

Bag 2002, Timmins, Ontario, P4N 7K1 Canada<P>
Acid Mist Generation is a major concern in zinc, copper and nickel electrowinning industry and there is a strong environmental drive to control its emission in the work environment. Foaming reagents are typically added to the electrolyte to alleviate this problem. In zinc electrowinning, licorice and saponin are examples of foaming reagents used for this purpose. In order for the foaming reagent to be effective, its foaming behaviour must be determined. In this work, a test procedure was developed to study the foaming characteristics of various surfactants for use as foaming agents to control acid mist in aqueous metal electrowinning. This new test was termed a &quot;mini-flotation test&quot; and it was used to study the foaming behaviour of a large number of reagents in an industrial zinc electrolyte under simulated zinc electrowinning conditions (gas sparging). In addition, the influence of important parameters such as current density, electrolyte temperature, reagent addition level and sulfuric acid concentration on the foaming characteristics of the electrolyte for each surfactant were investigated. This study has identified the most important factors that influence foam formation, growth and stability. This method could be used as a process control measure for reagent addition in the cellhouse by generating a calibration curve for the optimum electrolyte conditions.

The effects of operating parameters on cobalt electrowinning from sulphate solutions were investigated. Experiments were carried out in a divided five-litre cell holding two anodes and a single cathode (150 by 105 mm). The cell was operated in a continuous manner and the catholyte conditions (pH and temperature) were controlled. The following parameters were chosen as a base for the investigation: cobalt feed concentration 90 g/l, catholyte pH 2.5, temperature 65&#176;C, current density 250 A/m2. The feed flow-rate was set to achieve a Co of 30 g/l. The cobalt concentration in the catholyte was varied from 25 to 65 g/l and the current efficiency was found to increase linearly from 90 to 96. Varying the catholyte pH from 2 to 2.75 caused efficiency to increase linearly from 91 to 98%, but above pH 2.75 the rate of increase slowed. Efficiency remained at 95% between 35 and 65&#176;C. Cathodic current density was varied between 150 and 350 A/m2 and did not affect efficiency. Only temperature and catholyte H+ were found to affect the nature of the deposit. Below pH 2.5 many small pits occur. Above this pH, the deposit is shinier and has fewer, though larger, pits. The temperature of the catholyte has a marked effect on the deposit since pitting on the metal decreases dramatically below 50&#176;C. In order to simulate realistic cell behaviour, control of catholyte pH was relaxed. The feed flow-rate was varied from 2.2 to 4.5 ml/min, corresponding to a Co of 30 to 60 g/l. The catholyte pH and cobalt concentration were both found to increase with increasing flow-rate, which caused an increase in efficiency from 82 to 99%. The cell is modeled by considering (i) the transport of H+ across the diaphragm, (ii) the effect of Co and H+ on efficiency using Wark's Rule, (iii) the overall mass balance across the cell.

Researchers often use calcined coke and anode core properties to predict carbon consumption in aluminum reduction cells. This study compared laboratory analysis data and production data from 1992 through 1995 at RMC's Lake Charles Carbon Company and Baie Comeau Reduction Plant. During this period, carbon plant operations produced anodes with a range of properties using various calcined cokes. The results indicate that calcined cokes having a relatively wide range of properties can produce quality prebake anodes that yield low, stable carbon consumptions. Some coke and anode properties that are considered important quality parameters had little or no detrimental effect on carbon consumption. Correlations exist between certain coke and anode properties during time periods where the properties changed significantly.

The concentration of various metallic compounds in crude oils and in the resulting petroleum coke has continued an upward trend as crude reserves continue to change and tend toward being increasingly heavy and sour. Traditionally labeled as a catalyst, nickel has been included with vanadium in the evaluation of its effects on anode reactivity. In 1995, a Task Force was formed to quantify the influence of nickel on reduction cell anodes as existing information in the literature did not address specifically the affects of varying concentrations of nickel on anodes. The task force prepared resid with identical properties with the exception of nickel content. These resids were then coked, calcined, and formed into anodes in as identical a process as possible. Finally, the anodes were baked and tested to determine the effects on their performance characteristics. The results and conclusions drawn from this process will be communicated in this paper.

Vibrated bulk density is used to establish the binder content in prebaked anode paste. Alcan adopted the calcined coke VBD analytical method from Collier Carbon in 1961 with slight modifications. Recent paste quality problems (sticking in baking furnaces) were associated with a lack of precision in the VBD. The apparatus was identified as the main cause of imprecision (irregular flow when feeding the cylinder with the vibrating spatula, increase of table vibration amplitude over time and cylinder holding system) and an improved semi-automatic version was constructed. This communication describes the critical parts of the apparatus and their impact on the quality of the results. It also discusses calibration approach, analytical performance achieved (a four-fold improvement in reproducibility sigma = 0.003) and the impact on the paste production control.

The presence of petroleum-based dedusting agents applied to calcined petroleum coke for control of fugitive dust precludes obtaining correct analytical results when certain tests are performed. Removal of various dedusting agents in commercial use is difficult and the process (es) employed may also affect the properties obtained. Results are presented for studies of thermal, solvent extraction, and vacuum deoiling methods and their effectiveness for several surface-sensitive tests. While all methods are observed to remove virtually all of the dedusting agents, different types of residues or decomposition products remain on the coke particles and adversely affect test results. Depending on the particular properties to be determined and the desired accuracy of the results, more than one technique may be required.

The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of inorganic impurities on the reactivity of cokes and anode materials and at the same time to avoid the uncertainties that are introduced by the often complex background impurity content in industrial anode cokes. An aromatic distillate fraction from the production of coal tar pitch was used as coke precursor and cokes with controlled amounts of impurities were produced in a laboratory coker. Iron was added to the coke precursor as iron (III) acetylacetonate, and sulphur as dibenzothiophene. These organic substances dissolve in the precursor. The effects of iron and sulphur on the reactivities of cokes were measured in air at 500&#176;C and in CO2 at 960&#176;C. Surface studies (SEM, EDX) showed the topography of the surface, what iron phases were present and indicated the impact of iron and sulphur on the reaction.

AlTiB GRAIN REFINER - THE CONSISTENT INGREDIENT: </B> <I>P.C. van Wiggen</I>, KBM Master Alloys<P>
The use of AlTiB grain refiners for a precise control of the metallurgical cast structure has become an integral requirement in the manufacture of present day products. A permanent high standard in the quality and consistency of grain refiners is essential especially when considering their radical impact on the production result. This paper will discuss the consistency of grain refiners in terms of the composition, the production route and the required grain refiner properties. Particular attention will be given to an in-depth comprehension of the AlTiB microstructure. The above will be illustrated by microstructures and further supported by a selection of SPC data, process capabilities and (particle) distribution figures taken from various grain refiners. Information concerning recent advancements in the characterisation and process development of AlTiB grain refiners will also be incorporated in this paper.

TiBAl grain refiners are known to be susceptible to fading and poisoning phenomena which can limit their effectiveness in some practical situations.The long-term fading behaviour of good and bad TiBAl grain refiners in 99.7% Al is presented as a function of temperature in the presence of Zr and other transition metals. It is shown that fade occurs more rapidly at higher temperatures and that the effects of Zr and other transition metals display a complex behaviour as a function of temperature. The observations are explained in terms of recent theories on the behaviour of TiBAl grain refiners which propose that potent TiB2 nuclei have TiAl3 layers present on certain facets. It is shown that the reported behaviour is consistent with interactions occurring between transition metals and the potent aluminide layer. Results are discussed in terms of key stages in the production of TiBAl grain refiners and lessons for the use of TiBAl in the aluminium industry are highlighted.

The commercial AlTiB master alloys for grain refinement of aluminium contain TiB2 particles, which can be coarse and have the tendency to agglomerate in the melt. As a result of this, quality problems in different products occur.In Zr and Cr containing alloys TiB2 interacts with these elements leading to inhomogenous grain structure. In order to avoid the above mentioned disadvantages of the grain refinement with TiB2, a co-operative research programme has been carried out, to develop an improved AlTiC grain refiner. The main objectives of the project were: Development of an efficient AlTiC master alloy. Fundamental research to understand the mechanism of an AlTiC grain refiner. Evaluation of test methods for determination of the grain refining efficiency and agglomeration behaviour of TiC as standard test methods. Production scale testing of the developed AlTiC master alloy. The paper presents the results with respect to the above mentioned objectives.

Whereas small concentrations of Si have been shown to enhance the grain refinement of aluminium by addition of an Al-Ti-B master alloy grain refiner, increasing Si contents in excess of 2-3% result in a continuous increase in primary aluminium solid solution grain size. Two explanations of these observations have been proposed to date based on the influence of Si on either the nucleation or growth of the aluminium primary crystals. Neither of these explanations appears to fit all the available grain size data. In an attempt to further clarify the origin of the Si coarsening effect, grain size studies have been performed on Al-Si and Al-Zn alloys as a function of solute content. It appears that the coarsening is a result of the influence of the Si content on aluminium grain nucleation. A coarsening mechanism is suggested based on the coupled influence of Si level on melt undercooling and primary phase freezing range.

Refining of eutectic silicon in hyper-eutectic and eutectic Al-Si alloys is accomplished by using phosphorus-bearing additives. Commercially available copper-phosphorus (CuP) in a variety of forms and concentrations is widely used for this application. Large addition rates are needed for effective silicon modification via CuP. The recently developed ferro-phosphorus (FeP) based tableted product provides significant performance and cost advantages while requiring much smaller addition rates, lower alloy temperature, and short contact times. This paper compares the results for refinement of A390.1, B390.1, and 339.1 alloys using CuP and tableted FeP.

EFFECTS OF RESIDUAL TRANSITION METAL IMPURITIES ON ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY AND GRAIN REFINEMENT OF EC GRADE ALUMINIUM: </B> <I>R. Cook</I>, M.A. Kearns, P.S. Cooper, London &amp; Scandinavian Metallurgical Co. Ltd., Fullerton Road, Rotherham, South Yorkshire, S60 1DL, England<P>
Removal of transition metal impurities is a key step in production of high conductivity EC grade Aluminium. Titanium and Vanadium in particular are generally removed by adding an excess of Boron to precipitate stable borides before decanting the treated metal. It is nevertheless advantageous to add sufficient grain refiner to avoid hot cracking of the cast bar without jeopardising electrical conductivity. We report here a study of the effects of residual Vanadium on the efficiency of different grain refining additives and electrical conductivity of the product. It is shown that Vanadium must be below a threshold figure to give adequate grain refinement at levels which do not compromise conductivity. The effects of residual Fe and Si impurities on grain refinement and conductivity are also described and their role is discussed in terms of constitutional supercooling effects. The relevance of the results to the manufacture of EC grade wire is discussed.

The knowledge of the electrical conductivity of aluminum alloys is critical for the analysis and computer simulation of induction heating and melting operations as well as electromagnetic casters. While accurate conductivity data are available for pure aluminum, there is a paucity of data for aluminum alloys, particularly at elevated temperature. This paper describes an eddy current technique for measuring the electrical conductivity of metallic specimens at high temperatures. In this technique, which is based on measurement of the electric energy dissipation (Joule Heating), the electrical conductivity is determined from measurement of the heating rate of the specimen. The measurement is made by subjecting an insulated cylindrical specimen to a uniform axial alternating magnetic field, and measuring temperature of the specimen during heating. The method requires no contact with the specimen, and is capable of providing electrical conductivity data to the melting point of the specimen with an error of less than five percent. Upon validating the technique using pure aluminum, measurements have been conducted on Al-Mg (5182) and Al-Li (8090) wrought alloys, and on foundry and rheocast Al-Si (357) cast ingots. The results show that electrical conductivities of Si and Mg alloys are about one half of pure aluminum, and the microstructure of Al-Si 357 alloy has little effect on the electrical conductivity of the alloy. The Li containing alloy exhibited a much lower conductivity than Si and Mg alloys. Expressions are presented for the conductivities of these alloys up to 450&#176;C.

The computer-aided cooling curve analysis is a new method for thermal analysis that can be used in foundries of low budget and with small investment. This method tries to simulate the classic differential thermal analysis method (DTA) by using only an acquisition data system coupled to numerical methods in micro-computers. The kind of information provided by this technique includes thermodynamical and thermophysical data, heat transfer parameters, solidification kinetics, and microstructure features. All this information is more than that obtained with the classic DTA, and it is necessary in order to get a real comprehension of the solidification process. CA-CCA has been applied to the study of an Al-Si system to try to characterize it and to predict microstructure, because it is possible with this technique to obtain the evolution of solid during the solidification process and the segregation behaviour of this system.

Structure, mechanical properties, and dynamic fracture in nanocluster-assembled silicon nitride are investigated with molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations involving 1.08 million particles. The simulations reveal that intercluster regions in the consolidated nanophase Si3N4 are highly disordered with 50% undercoordinated atoms. These disordered interfacial regions deflect cracks and give rise to local crack branching. As a result, the nanophase system is able to sustain an order-of- magnitude larger external strain than the crystalline Si3N4. We also investigate the morphology of fracture surfaces in nanophase Si3N4. The MD results for roughness exponents are very close to experimental values [P. Daguier et al., Europhys.

THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF NANOPHASE CERAMICS:</B> <I> Paul G. Klemens</I>, Physics, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269-3046<P>
Heat conduction of insulators is by lattice waves (phonons), which have a wide frequency spectrum. The mean free path of phonons is limited by anharmonic intereactions and by scattering, principally scattering by point defects, and by grain boundaries and other etended imperfections. Point defects reduce the mean free path and the contribution to the conductivity of high frequency phonons; grain boundaries that of low frequency phonons. These reductions in conductivity will be discussed. They are additive in materials of micron-sized grains, but not in nanophase materials, where the frequency ranges of phonons affected by point defects and by grain boundary scattering may overlap. The effect of phonon scattering on the thermal conductivy will be discussed with reference to solutes, non-stoichiometry, grain size, and radiation damage.

As an emerging mass-data storage technology, phase change (PC) optical recording makes use of the difference in reflectivity between the amorphous and crystalline state of chalcogenide thin films. The amorphous state is obtained via laser melting and subsequent rapid cooling. For a better understanding of the melting behavior of such nanocrystalline plates, a Lennard-Jonesian fcc solid is studied using the method of molecular dynamics. Unlike the bulk case, it is shown that a plate melting is accompanied by a gradual change in both the volume and enthalpy. The melting point of a plate decreases as a function of h**(-n), where h is the thickness and n is 0.7. If the thickness becomes 15 lattice parameters, the melting point reaches a plateau. (111) plates show slightly higher melting points than those for (100) plates. The melting points of spherical clusters with radii ranging from 1.4 to 6.4 lattice parameters show a r**(-n) dependence, where r is the radius and n is 0.75.

The rate of grain growth in a crystalline material is proportional to both the mobility and energy of its grain boundaries. Standard techniques for hindering grain growth, such as solute drag, are kinetic in nature: that is, they aim to reduce the mobility term. A thermodynamic approach, however, should be just as effective: a reduction in grain-boundary energy would be accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the driving force for grain growth. According to the Gibbs adsorption theorem, grain-boundary energies can be reduced by introducing a component that tends to segregate to the grain boundaries. We have investigated ball-milled solid solution of Pd1-xZrz for signs of improved stability against grain growth with increasing Zr concentration; the growth rate is observed to drop to very low values for x greater than 0.2. Differential scanning calorimetry has been used to estimate the concentration dependence of the grain-boundary energy, thereby isolating the themodynamic contribution to grain-growth stability from that due to solute drag.

We performed inelastic neutron scattering experiments on two states of Ni3Fe: 1) as-milled, when the material had a characteristic nanocrystallite size of 9 nm, and 2) annealed, when the material had a characteristic crystallite size of 30 nm. The nanophase material showed an enhancement by a factor of 2 in its density of states at energies below 15 meV, and some broadening of its longitudinal peak at 33 meV. The large enhancement in the density of states at these low energies appears to require coupling between inter- and intra-crystallite vibrational motions. The inter-crystalline modes would be associated with the vibrations of the crystallites themselves. These measured changes in vibrational DOS predict a difference in vibrational entropy of the bulk and nanocystalline Ni3Fe of about 0.18 kB/atom at high temperatures, with the nanocrystalline materials having the larger vibrational entropy. This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under contract DE-FG03-86ER45270.

Working with a range of current ceramic materials with a wide variety of applications, it is shown that considerable improvements can be obtained when one starts with Small Solid State Systems (S4) Materials studied range from doped ZnO varistors, PZT piezoelectrics, YIG microwave materials, and the new superconductors. General principles underlying these changes are shown to be dependent on the dispersion relations of phonons and wavevectors (for ferroelectrics) and magnons and wavevectors (for ferromagnetics). Another S4 rule that we have found applicable for most oxides is the tendency towards higher symmetry and increasing unit-cell-volume with decreasing size of the S4s. These changes may usher in phase transformation(s) and size dependent phase transition temperatures.

Undergraduate engineering curricula are designed by faculty committees in accord with accrediting guidelines for content, logical course sequencing and practical limitations for scheduling faculty and laboratory resources. Presently, engineering education is receiving intense scrutiny due to several decades of large tuition increases, continuous enrollment declines since the early '80s, constraints in external research support and decreases in the number of employment opportunities for graduates. These trends have already resulted in proposals for new curriculum designs which would, for example, reduce credits needed for graduation, sacrifice discipline-specific content and increase multidisciplinary activities. Presumably, such curricula would broaden appeal, increase engineering enrollments, widen the range of career opportunities and stimulate interest in industrial interactions. Can such curricula provide the optimum balance between the new educational boundary conditions and quality engineering education? To what extent should curriculum design emphasize graduate/employer feedback, student/parent expectations, instructional philosophy/methodology and general skill development (communication, self-directed learning, open-ended problem solving, ethical decision making, etc.)? Tradeoffs and opportunities associated with these issues will be discussed.

THE MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CORE CURRICULUM AT VIRGINIA TECH:</B> R.W. Hendricks, R.S. Gordon, Virginia Tech, MSE Dept., Blacksburg, VA 24061-0237<P>
We have developed a core curriculum for an ABET-approved Materials Science and Engineering curriculum incorporating 8 required core courses, options in each of the 5 principle fields (ceramics, composites, electronic materials, metallurgy and polymers), and developed an integrated &quot;across-the-curriculum&quot; approach to writing and communication, ethics, and statistics. Our required core courses, each with laboratory, include physical ceramics, physical metallurgy, electronic materials, and polymer engineering. These &quot;material specific&quot; courses are supported by three material-independent courses including X-ray diffraction, thermodynamics and transport processes, and by a capstone engineering design course based on a research project. Oral, written, and graphical communication, statistics, and ethics and integrated in a manner such that the student is led from fundamental concepts through to sophisticated interpretation of each topic. The student is exposed to these &quot;across-the-curriculum&quot; topics during each semester of the three year program of study beginning with the sophomore year.

MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING: THE NEW UNDERGRADUATE CURRICULUM AT DREXEL UNIVERSITY:</B> <I>Alan Lawley</I>, Dept. of Materials Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA 19104<P>
In 1994 the new undergraduate Drexel Engineering Curriculum was implemented, emphasizing 'up front' engineering, computer and communication skills, life long learning and teamwork. This common core in the first two years reflects many of the tenets and the philosophy of the E4 experiment ('Enhanced Educational Experience for Engineering Students') which began in 1988. Concurrently, the Department of Materials Engineering has been proactive in the Gateway Coalition, a major component of which is to build on E4 by focusing on the upper level curriculum via the development of advanced engineering science courses. Our new undergraduate major, enacted in 1995, reflects the maturing of the E4 experiment into the core Drexel Engineering Curriculum and the integration of selected engineering science courses (developed under the Gateway Coalition) into the curriculum at the upper level. Evolution of the new curriculum is discussed, including the development of modules in materials education.

MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CURRICULA; RETHINKING THE CORE CONTENT - THE CASE FOR A 128 HOUR CORE:</B> <I>Richard L. Porter</I>, Campus Box 7904, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695-7904<P>
Most materials educators agree that three major components constitute the undergraduate materials science and engineering curriculum; that presented in the first 2-3 semesters (generally the basic sciences), the real &quot;core,&quot; and finally the obligatory senior design or capstone experience. Scattered throughout will be the necessary humanities and social sciences, maybe a communications course or technical writing course. It is assummed that the mathematics, chemistry, physics, and writing have been properly and correctly introduced and students' have mastered the content. There are several problems with this approach; little if any experiential learning, little if any contextual learning for the basic sciences, little integration of engineering sciences with the basic sciences, and in many cases a disconnected core. Although all curricula meet and or exceed ABET criteria, there is little accountability for the actual content and methodology of presenting the material. This paper discusses the entire curricula in context with the intended outcome for materials science and engineering and encourages curricular designers to rethink the entire learning experience, not to simply add more courses for short term accomplishments. At North Carolina State University, our approach has been to introduce different models for first year engineering, ranging from a hands-on engineering experience linked with freshmen writing, an integrated approach pulling together math, chemistry, and physics, with a year year engineering overview, and recently a new freshmen course linked with the computer literacy course and including a weekly small-group problem solving session. Concurrently, we have administered an attitudes survey at the beginning of the year and again at the end of the semester and year. Students enrolled in these special courses report a greater interest in engineering as a problem solving discipline, they view engineering as an iterative process, and report a higher degree of satisfaction with their first year experiences. Finally, a curriculum will be presented and discussed that builds upon the fundamental basic sciences and integrates the curriculum rather than present it as a linear combination of sub-disciplines.

There is a broad recognition at IIT that we live in a time of revolutionary change in undergraduate education. In response, we are developing new ways to recruit and retain a diverse student body, seeking educational relationships with industry, experimenting with new approaches to teaching and learning, and positioning ourselves to meet ABET engineering criteria for the year 2000. The key elements of the undergraduate education restructuring will be presented. They include, but are not limited to, such initiatives as: Interprofessional Projects, project-oriented learning that teams students from different disciplines and professions and constitutes a new instructional tool though which students learn concepts of teamwork, communication and problem solving; Introduction to the Professions, a freshman-level course that in an innovative way bridges the gap between high school experience and the university's environment; Writing Across Curriculum, an institutional structure for integrating writing into engineering courses.

EFFECTIVE USE OF A SMALL FACULTY FOR MAINTENANCE OF A COMPREHENSIVE MATERIALS ENGINEERING PROGRAM:</B> <I>Jeffrey W. Fergus</I>, Materials Research and Education Center, 201 Ross Hall, Auburn University, AL 36849<P>
A recent analysis of the materials/metallurgical engineering programs at U.S. universities shows that these programs can be divided into three, approximately equal, groups in terms of faculty size. Specifically, there are 24 programs with 21-90 faculty, 23 programs with 13-20 faculty and 25 programs with 3-12 faculty. The small number of faculty in this latter group presents challenges in terms of maintaining a comprehensive (undergraduate, graduate, research) materials program. This presentation will relate experience with the materials engineering program at Auburn University, which has 7 full-time faculty, in meeting these challenges. In addition, the contribution of these small programs to the materials engineering discipline as a whole will be discussed.

DESIGNING WITH Pb-FREE SOLDERS:</B> <I>Walter L. Winterbottom</I>, Reliability Consultant, 30106 Pipers Lane Court, Farmington Hill, MI 48331<P>
As the global competition in the transportation industry intensifies, the focus on quality and time-to-market have become major driving forces in product design and dominant forces in the market place. Although the current design/development process as practiced in the industry provides a time tested path for new products, leadership in these areas seems to be elusive. A York Times article (March, 1991) notes that <I>Consumers Report</I> ranks the reliability of new American models at about the level of the average Japanese models. In 1988, the Material Systems Reliability Department was organized in the Materials Research Laboratory of Ford Research with the mission to evaluate existing, and develop if necessary, design methodologies capable of the task of providing world leadership in both quality and time-to-market. It was apparent from the outset that a life-cycle design approach must be used to contain reliability, cost, and environmental considerations in a time efficient manner. Further, it became increasingly apparent from the Department's failure mode/root cause identification and testing assistance activities that these issues have to be designed into a product rather than being assured by extensive prototype testing programs. A Design-for-Reliability methodology based upon the development of analytical prototypes which has the capability to fulfill the requirements for world leadership. The methodology is based upon the definition of system failure modes and mechanisms, system model development with verification capable of reliability prediction early in the design process prior to the building and testing of prototype hardware. This 'preventive' approach is based upon quantitative reliability estimates as a key design metric for use in assessing design alternatives. In simplest terms, the approach emphasizes the need to consider products as material systems whose reliability must be thoroughly understood early in the design and development process. The traditional 'build, test, and fix' design approach must be replaced with an approach that relies upon analytical prototypes leading to a single, optimized, prototype hardware build. In the presentation, the Design-for-Reliability approach will be illustrated using electronic packaging design with lead-free solder interconnects as example.

DESIGN OF NEW SOLDER ALLOYS THROUGH MICROSTRUCTURE CONTROL: </B> <I>Sungho Jin</I>, Lucent Technologies, Bell Laboratories, Room 1A-123, 700 Mountain Avenue, Murray Hill, NJ 07974<P>
The mechanical properties of solder alloys and reliability of solder joints are significantly affected by microstructural features such as grain size, phase distribution, and precipitate morphology. A finer grain size, smaller precipi
 tates, and a uniformity in phase, precipitate and grain size distribution are often beneficial for improving the strength and ductility as well as the resistance in fatigue and creep failures. The control of microstructure is accomplished by modifications in alloy chemistry and processing conditions. Several examples of microstructural control in lead-free solder systems will be discussed. More forward-looking approaches for further control of microstructure in solder alloys and composites, e.g., by distribution of nano-scale dispersoid particles will also be discussed.

SUMMARY OF RECENT STUDIES OF THE EFFECT OF PROCESSING ON MICROSTRUCTURE OF SOME SOLDER ALLOYS:</B> <I>James Clum</I>, E. Cotts, N. Jiang, Mechanical Engineering, Physics Department, State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902<P>
A variety of solder alloys selected from the Sn-based, and In-based systems, have been examined to test for the interaction of composition with processing conditions in controlling alloy microstructure. Rate of solidification, amount of compressive strain, annealing temperature and time were the independent variable studied. Grain size, phase fraction and microhardness have been monitored as measures of microstructural changes. A simple factorially designed experimental plan has been used to conduct and interpret the tests. A major effect of solidification rate and a secondary effect of the interaction between deformation and annealing was observed for most alloys. The effect of alloy composition is reflected primarily in terms of the role of Tambient/Tm on microstructural stability. Some other processing related characteristics of these solder alloys will also be discussed such as creep and stress relaxation behavior. The role of microstructure in behaviors such as grain boundary sliding will be illustrated.

EVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVES TO LEAD SOLDERS FOR PRINTED WIRING APPLICATIONS:</B> <I>James F. Maguire</I>, Boeing Co., P. O. Box 3999, Defense &amp; Space Systems Group, Mail Stop 3W-97, Seattle, WA 98124<P>
This paper describes the first phase of a three year program undertaken by Boeing to evaluate &quot;no lead&quot; materials as a potential replacement for solder in printed wiring assembly applications. This program is looking at a number of different potential replacements including both conductive adhesives and &quot;no lead&quot; solder materials. In addition, the impact of other environmentally driven process changes such as &quot;no clean&quot; soldering and lead free PWB finishes are being tested for compatibility with &quot;no lead&quot; attachment materials. The phases of this program are: Phase I: Initial materials evaluations, processability, stability of electrical performance in environmental exposure, sequential exposure to temperature/humidity cycling and thermal shock environments, compatibility with &quot;standard&quot; finishes (reflowed solder and &quot;de-oxidized&quot; copper), down Selection for Phase II testing; Phase II: detailed material performance testing, stability of contact and bulk resistance during environmental exposure, compatibility with high speed/RF applications, * Compatibility with existing PWA processes such as - pre-conformal coat cleaning, rework/repair, down selection for Phase III testing; Phase III: Development of design allowables and manufacturing processes. This paper will discuss the results of Phase I of this program which evaluated a total of 21 conductive adhesives and 8 commercially available solder alloys with control samples fabricated with Sn63 solder.

CREEP AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF Sn-5%Sb SOLDER: </B> <I>Rao K. Mahidhara</I>, K. Linga Murty and Fahmy M. Haggag, Tessera Inc., 3099 Orchard Drive, San Jose, CA 95134; North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695; Advanced Technology Corporation, Oak Ridge, TN 37830<P>

A knowledge of the mechanical and creep properties of solder materials is required both for alloy development and life-prediction. We report here tensile and creep properties of Sn-5%Sb which is one of the candidate materials for replacing lead-based solders in electronic packaging. The temperature and stress dependencies of the strain-rate are evaluated using both the tensile and creep tests. In addition, the recently developed Stress-Strain Microprobe (SSM) is used to evaluate the strain-rate dependence of stress through automated ball indentation (ABI) tests at ambient. An excellent correlation is noted between creep and ABI data. While creep tests covered low stresses, ABI corresponded to high stresses which revealed breakdown of the Norton-law noted at lower stresses. While creep tests took 5 months time, the ABI tests were completed in a matter of hours although they covered 3 orders of magnitude strain-rates. The utility of ABI technique in solder joints is clearly pointed out and such tests are planned on <I>real</I> joints. ABI tests at elevated temperatures were not performed to-date. Such a facility is now under development and future plans include testing at elevated temperatures on bulk as well as solder joints.

CHARACTERIZATION OF 58Bi-42Sn SOLDERED ON Sn-Pb COATED SURFACE:</B> <I>Zequn Mei</I>, Fay Hua, Judy Glazer, Hewlett-Packard Co., Electronic Assembly Development Center, Mail Stop 4U-3, 1501 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304<P>
As reported in our previous work, solder joints of 58Bi-Sn on 80Sn-20Pb coated surface failed prematurely in thermal cycles between -40&#176;C to 100&#176;C. The failure mechanism was identified to be the dissolving of Pb atoms into the 58Bi-Sn solder joint during soldering, which caused formation of the ternary eutectic 52Bi-30Pb-18Sn with melting point of 95&#176;C. In this paper, study of three types of solder joints will be reported: (1) 58Bi-42Sn soldered on Cu surface, (2) 58Bi-42Sn solder on 80Sn-20Pb coated surface, and (3) 57.5Bi-41.5Sn-1Pb soldered on Cu surface. These solder joints were aged at 80&#176;C and 110&#176;C. The evolution of the grain or phase sizes and the degradation of mechanical properties will be characterized as function of aging time. Early results indicate that the grains grew much faster in the solder joints containing Pb atoms (types 2 and 3 above), which reduced mechanical strength and ductility, than the solder joints without Pb atoms (type 1). Detailed results will be reported in the meeting.

The properties of a Pb-free ternary eutectic solder alloy, Sn-4.7Ag-1.7Cu (wt.%), which was discovered in our laboratory have been evaluated. This patented alloy has a melting point of 217&#176;C, a fine 3-phase eutectic microstructure, and a very good solderability. The primary goal of this investigation has been to enhance its microstructural stability for high temperature environments, greater than 125&#176;C, and to improve its overall mechanical properties, especially for extended service. Thus, minor modifications were made in the base eutectic alloy to control microstructural aging without degrading solderability. Alloying effects on solder/Cu joints in the as-soldered and aged conditions were studied. Tensile strength and shear strength measurements were made using butt and lap shear joint configurations, respectively, under various loading conditions. The results will be presented and their implications will be discussed. Support from the DOE-BES-DMS under Contract No. W-7405-Eng-82 is gratefully acknowledged.

Aging of both sessile drops and in-board peel test samples was conducted at 134 to 190&#176;C for up to 1000 hours.

<P>
The effects of stress and temperature on the creep rate of 95.5Sn4Cu0.5Ag solder joints at 22&#176;C to 168&#176;C were investigated employing stress-change and temperature-change tests. The resulting plastic deformation kinetics are in accord with those obtained previously in constant strain rate tests. They are better described by an obstacle-controlled dislocation glide kinetics equation than the usual Dorn equation for diffusion-controlled mechanism. The Helmholtz free energy for overcoming the obstacles is 0.28&#181;b3, where &#181; is the shear modulus and <I>b</I> the Burgers vector. The activation volume is of the order of 1000 b3. The plastic deformation kinetics are in reasonable accord with the intersection of dislocations as the rate-controlling mechanism. However, alternative mechanisms are not ruled out.

GRAIN GROWTH IN POLYCRYSTALLINE THIN FILMS:</B> C.V. Thompson, Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, M.I.T., Cambridge MA 02139<P>
Polycrystalline thin films are used in a wide variety of applications, especially in electronic and magnetic devices and systems. In these applications, the properties, performance and reliability of polycrystalline films are strongly affected by the average grain size, grain shapes, the way in which grain sizes are distributed and the distribution of grain orientations. These vary with deposition technique and with deposition conditions, and can also be modified through post-deposition processing. The factors which affect the structure and crystallographic texture of polycrystalline films will reviewed and categorized. Approaches for process development for application-specific optimized structures will be outlined.

NEW MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF POLYCRYSTALLINE GOLD THIN FILMS:</B> Alexander H. King, Varun Singh, Department of Materials Science &amp; Engineering, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794-2275<P>
We have made detailed observations of unsupported gold thin films, using transmission electron microscopy. These films embody a strong [111] fiber texture, as found in many FCC metal thin films. Rotations of individual grains about the [111] surface normal are observed and we present a simple model that mimics this behavior, providing a reasonable explanation for it. We will also present an analysis of the triple junctions in the films showing that symmetry is the most significant factor in determining the energy associated with a triple junction. We will show that supposed &quot;U-lines&quot; do not embody the disclinations that are expected on the basis of Bollmann's analysis.

MODELING OF GRAIN GROWTH IN THIN FILMS WITH TEXTURE:</B> <I>Harold J. Frost</I>, Johan Grape, Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH<P>
We have developed our two-dimensional simulation of grain growth to include several effects which apply for the case of large-grained polycrystalline thin films in which the grains completely traverse the film thickness and the grain boundaries are all nearly perpendicular to the plane of the film. To properly include the effects of texture we must include the following factors which differ among individual grains based on crystallographic orientation: surface energies for the film-substrate and film-covering interface; elastic compliances, and the related strain-energy densities when elastic strains are imposed; yield stresses, which limit the elastic strains and strain-energy densities. In this paper we will expand on previous treatments by explicitly allowing for variations in grain boundary energy and mobility, based on the 
 relative misorientation of neighboring grains. In this case, the grain growth evolution favors pairs of grains separated by low angle (low energy) grain boundaries. Such low energy boundaries generally separate grains of the same texture component. Other effects, such as pinning by surface grooving, pinning by precipitate particles or holes in the film, and solute drag may also be included in the simulations.

POST-PATTERNING MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION OF Al-Cu INTERCONNECT LINES:</B> <I> D. P. Field</I>, TexSEM Laboratories, Inc., 226 W. 2230 N., Provo, UT 84604<P>
Optimization of microstructural features in interconnect lines for integrated circuits is becoming increasingly important for device reliability as the minimum feature size continues to shrink. Recent efforts have clearly demonstrated that not only grain size and precipitate morphologies are affected by the patterning and subsequent anneal, but also the crystallographic texture and grain boundary structure evolve during this process. For narrow lines, the (111) fiber texture sharpens and the near-bamboo grain structure is controlled by interface area minimization and grain boundary energy minimization. The current work describes the competing energetics associated with the process. Experimental results using orientation imaging microscopy as the analysis technique on Al-1% Cu interconnect lines are shown to support the analyses.

A review of extensive Al texture characterization by x-ray diffraction methods will be presented for various Ti, TiN, and Al layering schemes and sputter deposition conditions.

In narrow metal lines used for chip level interconnects, the electromigration reliability is affected by variations in the microstructure. Electromigration failure distributions were obtained experimentally for six different Al-Cu interconnect widths, ranging from 1mm to 8mm. Or each of these line widths, the microstructure was characterized (using TEM) and the initial stress distribution was calculated. This information was used, with a flux divergence model, to simulate the entire failure distribution for each line width. These simulations, when compared to the experimental failure distributions, were used to quantify important material parameters, such as atomic diffusivities and failure criteria. This information, in turn, can be used to accurately extrapolate electromigration data. A detailed failure analysis was carried out on the simulated lines to study the effect of microstructure variations on electromigration failure.

Grain boundary misorientations and the crystallographic character of boundary planes were determined for individual grain boundaries using electron backscatter diffraction in the scanning electron microscope as well as focussed ion beam images. We have summarized the data for a number of boundaries immediately adjacent to voids and made direct comparisons to boundaries from regions which remained intact. These data were acquired from the same lines, and so represent measurements from material with identical thermal histories. The results suggest that significant variations in local structure exist in narrow lines, and that those local regions associated with more favorable kinetics are more susceptible to void formation and growth.

PROCESSING-PROPERTY-MICROSTRUCTURE RELATIONSHIPS IN TiAl-BASED ALLOYS:</B> <I>M H. Loretto</I>, D. Hu, A. Godfrey, T.T. Cheng, I.P. Jones, P.A. Blenkinsop, IRC in Materials for High Performance Applications, The University of Birmingham, Edgbaston B15 2TT, UK<P>
A range of TiAl-based alloys has been produced by plasma melting either small buttons (1kg samples) or ingots (up to 50kg). These alloys have been subsequently processed using isothermal forging, extrusion and/or HIPping. Some problems associated with the melting and subsequent processing of these alloys will be discussed and the ways found to overcome these problems outlined. Microstructural data obtained from some of these alloys will be presented which show the relationship between processing route and microstructure, and these observations will be correlated with mechanical properties. It will be shown that the microstructure can be closely controlled by appropriate processing and further that for a range of alloy compositions the properties can be controlled more by processing than by composition. For other alloys the composition is more important.

DEFORMATION OF NANOCRYSTALLINE Ti-48Al: </B> <I>L.S. Kim</I>, T. Klassen, C.J. Altstetter, R.S. Averback, Materials Science and Engineering Department, University of Illinois, 1304 W. Green St., Urbana, IL 61801<P>
When the grain size is a few tens of nanometers, TiAl is ductile at moderately elevated temperatures. Such grain sizes were produced by ball milling of titanium and aluminum powders, which must be consolidated without excessive grain growth. Green compacts (80% dense) were sinterforged at temperatures near 650&#176;C, achieving relative densities of 99%. The final grain size was roughly 60 nm. The deformation temperature is several hundred degrees below those used for sintering microcrystalline powders. Pore elimination is promoted during sinterforging by the deviatoric stress components due to the absence of die- wall constraints. The resultant shear deformation is undoubtedly enhanced by grain boundary deformation modes in nanocrystalline material. Hardness measurements at moderately elevated temperatures are used to develop the constitutive relation for deformation of TiAl. Densification and deformation have been studied as a function of temperature, load and grain size.

ROLE OF MICROSTRUCTURE ON SUPERPLASTICITY IN <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma-bold.gif">-TiAl ALLOYS:</B> <I>R.S. Mishra</I>, A.K. Mukherjee, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of California, Davis, CA 95616<P>
A number of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl alloys exhibit superplasticity. The optimum superplastic temperature is strongly dependent on the grain size. For materials with grain sizes &gt;10 &#181;m, the superplastic temperatures are above <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 transition temperature. On the other hand, superplastic temperatures for materials with grain sizes &lt;5 &#181;m is below 1373K. Surprisingly, however, the state of second phase, i.e., ordered <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 or disordered a does not influence the kinetics of superplastic deformation and the parametric dependencies remain similar. These observations suggest that the slip accommodation and dislocation climb in g phase as the rate controlling mechanism. Some new results on nanocrystalline <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> TiAl are presented, which shows the possibility of low temperature superplasticity. The flow stresses in submicrocrystalline and nanocrystalline <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl alloys are consistent with a slip accommodation model.

Gamma titanium aluminide (Ti-47Al-2Cr-2Nb-0.2B, Ti-47Al-2Cr-0.2Si at. %) sheets were produced by near-isothermal rolling of forged material. The microstructures resulting from annealing of the rolled sheets below and above the eutectoid temperatures were studied by a combination of optical, X-ray, SEM, and TEM methods. Transition temperatures including the alpha transus temperature were determined by DTA and annealing experiments. Textures were studied on as-rolled and annealed sheets. Tensile properties of annealed specimens were determined at RT-800&#176;C. Deformation microstructure was analyzed by TEM and fractographs were studied by SEM. In the case of Ti-47Al-2Cr-0.2Si at. % the influence of strain rate on the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature was studied for different microstructures. Additionally, the superplastic behavior was investigated for Ti-47Al-2Cr-0.2Si (at. %) sheet in the temperature range of 1000-1100&#176;C. The results will be presented and the underlying deformation mechanisms discussed. The Ti-47Al-2Cr-2Nb-0.2B sheet material was provided by McDonnell Douglas and AFWL/MLLM and the portion of the work based on Ti-47Al-2Cr-2Nb-0.2B sheet material was supported by NASA LeRC, Cleveland, OH, under Contract No. NAS3-26385<I>.</I><P>

EFFECT OF EXTRUSION TEMPERATURE ON THE MICROSTRUCTURE OF A POWDER METALLURGY TiAl-BASED ALLOY:</B> <I>L.M. Hsiung</I>, T.G. Nieh, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, P. O.

The microstructure of a P/M Ti-47Al-2Cr-1Nb-1Ta (at.%) alloy powder-extruded at different temperatures has been studied. Three different temperatures: one near to the eutectoid temperature (T1), one within the (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">) two phase field (T2), and one at a phase field (T3), were employed for the extrusion. The as-prepared powder consists of mainly <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif"> phase and small amount of supercooled <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">/B2 grains and a fine-grained (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2) duplex structure.

Fine grained lamellar microstructures would be expected to exhibit high strength, high creep strength, high fracture toughness and moderate ductility. This presentation discusses the use of high temperature extrusion to produce fine grained lamellar microstructures in both ingot and powder metallurgy Ti-48Al-2Nb-2Cr alloys. The effect of processing parameters, such as extrusion temperature and cooling rate, on the microstructure and properties are examined. In addition, the thermal stability of the fine grained microstructures was examined by subsequent heat treatments. The results of this study indicate that fine grained lamellar microstructures can be generated in both ingot and powder metallurgy materials. However, the selection of the appropriate processing parameters is required to optimize the microstructure and properties.

Dense <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl and in-situ TiAl based IMCs were fabricated via pressure-assisted thermal explosion. Fine Ti-Al powder blends with and without the addition of BN or NiB were used as the starting reagents. Rapid heating to the ignition temperature of thermal explosion was realized via resistive heating or by placing the reagent compacts into a preheated pressure die. The presence of an additional low temperature phase in the composition with NiB greatly assisted the process of consolidation. The application of a moderate external pressure (&#190; 200 MPa) during processing was shown to be enough to accommodate negative volume changes associated with reactive synthesis and, thereby, to ensure full density of the final product. Microstructure and phase composition of the materials obtained were characterized employing x-ray diffraction and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) with energy dispersive analysis (EDS). The entire procedure of thermal explosion under pressure could be performed in open air without noticeable oxidation damage to the final product. Rapid cooling due to heat transfer into the pressure die allowed to prevent the coarsening of microstructure in the materials synthesized. The formation of a finely distributed reinforcing phase resulted in high mechanical properties of the in-situ TiAl matrix composites.

Near binary gamma TiAl engine valves were investment cast by the Hitchener process. Effects of HIP temperature, pressure and time on mechanical properties and microstructure were investigated, and the HIP process was optimized for ductility. A HIP + heat treat study was able to separate the beneficial contributions of porosity closure and microstructural development. Effects of iron additions on the optimum aluminum content were noted and will be discussed.

AUTOGENOUS GAS TUNGSTEN ARC WELDABILITY OF CAST ALLOY Ti-48Al-2Cr- 2Nb VERSUS EXTRUDED ALLOY Ti-46Al-2Cr-2Nb-0.9Mo:</B> V.L. Acoff, <I>D. Bharani</I>, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Box 870202, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487-0202
<P>
In the majority of the engineering applications for which gamma based titanium aluminide alloys are being considered, fusion welding is the primary form of joining. Sound (crack and void free) welds using the gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process with matching, or near matching, filler metal have been accomplished. However, procedures for consistently producing crack-free autogenous (without filler metal) GTA welds have not been achieved. This paper will discuss the autogenous gas tungsten arc weldability of cast alloy Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb (at.%) and of extruded alloy Ti-46Al-2Cr-2Nb-0.9Mo (at.%) and will compare their resultant fusion zone microstructure and properties. Samples were spot welded without any preheat. Microstructural characterization has been performed using optical microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) system. Mechanical properties of the fusion zone will be discussed in terms of Vickers microhardness numbers and tensile testing.

TEXTURES OF GOLD MINERAL PHASES RELATED TO HEAP LEACHING: </B> William Petruk, Consultant, Former Chief Mineralogist, CANMET, Ottawa, Canada K1A OG1<P>
Native gold and electrum are the main gold minerals recovered by heap leaching. Recovery depends on ore textures that influence exposure during crushing and grinding in preparation for heap leaching. Textures include gold-bearing veinlets along fractures and microfractures, and gold occurrences along grain boundaries. Small encapsulated gold grains in quartz, pyrite and arsenopyrite are not likely exposed, and generally non-recoverable. Similar submicroscopic forms of gold are not recoverable by heap leaching. Detailed studies have shown that many so-called encapsulated gold grains may occur either along weakly bonded grain boundaries or microfracture in minerals, which become exposed by fine grinding. Ore textures in various ores will be reviewed. Ore types include gold in arsenopyrite-pyrite-quartz veins, gold-chalcopyrite deposits, disseminated gold in sediments, Carlin-type gold ores, gold-pyrite associations, and gold in volcanogenic ores, etc.

Gold associations were established in a biooxidized, chlorinated CIL<B> </B> residue assaying 0.02 oz Au/t and in a biooxidized thiosulfate leach residue assaying 0.01 oz Au/t. Detailed Mineralogic study involved: assays of screened fractions; light microscopy; ion probe microanalysis to quantify 'invisible' gold in sulfide minerals; proton probe microanalysis to detect submicroscopic gold in chert; and laser microprobe analysis to detect and quantify preg-robbed gold. In the CIL residue most of the gold is preg-robbed (71%). In the thiosulfate leach residue, gold occurs mainly as submicroscopic disseminations in microcrystalline quartz (chert). In both residues the 'invisible' gold in pyrite accounts for a minor fraction of the gold assay. Quantitative determination of the gold occurrence in the two residue samples established conclusively that gold adsorption on carbonaceous matter in the thiosulfate leach is of minor importance. <P>

A multidisciplinary investigation (SIMS, EPMA, Mossbauer) was used to characterize gold in four Siberian mesothermal sulfide gold deposits: Olympiadnenskoe and Veduginskoe within the Enisei Mountain Range and Nezhdaninskoe and Sentachan in the Verchoyansk-Kolyma area. It was found that some of the mineralization is refractory in all four deposits, occurring in large part as &quot;invisible&quot; gold in arsenopyrite and a lesser amount in pyrite. The gold concentration and distribution vary considerably, both within and between grains of arsenopyrite, with implications for processing options, such as heap leaching.

AUGMENT X4 TECHNOLOGY FROM THE LAB TO FEASIBILITY; A CASE STUDY: </B> K.M. Schall, K.A. Brunk, <I>G.R. Maxwell,</I> Augment Technologies, Denver, CO 80235<P>
Gold ores containing oxide copper incur significant cost penalties when leached with cyanide, because 4-5 moles of cyanide are consumed for each mole of leached copper. This equates to ~4 lbs of NaCN per lb of leached Cu. Total cost of excess NaCN consumption plus CN destruction can exceed $4.00 per ton of ore. AuGMENT Technologies has developed and demonstrated a new process that can: 1) economically recover 70-80% of cyanide fed to a mill; 2) produce salable copper cathodes; and 3) reduce the need for cyanide destruction facility. Standard resin processing and electrowinning equipment are used to recover the cyanide and produce copper cathodes. Steps have been taken to determine: 1) how to develop resin kinetics; 2) how the AuGMENT Process can be scaled up; 3) how much savings is incurred at mill site; and 4) how the novel 'electro-elution' circuit achieves efficient operation.

COPPER RECOVERY AND CYANIDE REGENERATION FROM CYANIDE SOLUTIONS: </B> <I>H. Soto </I>and F. Nava, Dept. Mines and Metallurgy, Laval University, Quebec City, Quebec G1K 7P4<P>
A method has been developed to recover cyanide and copper from heap leach cyanide solutions containing copper complexes and thiocyanate. Copper is precipitated as copper thiocyanate or copper cyanide, depending on pH and concentrations of thiocyanate and cyanide in effluents. Precipitates assaying over 50% Cu show good dewatering qualities and separate readily from effluents by filtration. Solutions containing bulk of cyanide are oxidized with ozone to transform remaining thiocyanate to cyanide, resulting in purified cyanide solution that can be recycled. The pH of the effluent is lowered to optimize precipitation and oxidation, and then raised to regenerate the cyanide. Recoveries are in excess of 96% of Cu and CN. Efficiencies of oxidation are 85-90%. Economic evaluation indicates a profitable process for solutions containing more than about 250 ppm copper. A bleed of barren solutions from cyanocidic gold/copper ores could be treated economically by heap leaching, since CN consumed by Cu could be regenerated at no cost.

Single- and multiple-domain levitators of YBa2Cu3Ox have been processed using the seeded melt texturing method. It has been found that the growth rate has varied depending upon the undercooling, the temperature gradient, and composition. A systematic study has been carried out to establish the relationship between the growth front velocity and composition, in particular the 211 concentration. For a given undercooling and temperature gradient, the growth rate of the domain can be strongly affected by the 211 density in the matrix. Evidences will be provided to show the important contributions of compositions and 211 morphology to the growth rates of center domain during the seeded melt texturing.

Both types of additions are effective in reducing the coarsening of Y2BaCuO5 particles in the melt during texturing. Both additions also lead to improvements in the magnetic properties of Y-123 compared to samples without Ce-based additions.

The growth kinetics of YBCO superconductor have been studied by quench experiments during seeded isothermal melt-texturing. An undercooling of 15&#176;C is found to be necessary to initiate nucleation of YBa2Cu3Ox following peritectic decomposition. A smooth transition is observed in the growth anisotropy with increasing undercooling, with the growth being faster along the c-axis at low undercoolings (15 to 25&#176;C) and faster along the a-b plane at high undercoolings (&gt;25&#176;C). Based on these findings, a modified melt-texturing process was developed, where, instead of slow cooling following melting, an isothermal hold was employed in the temperature range where the growth is isotropic. By this modification, the time required to texture 1&quot; diameter disks was reduced to 15 hours which is about 4 to 5 times faster than a typical slow cooling melt-texturing process. Correspondingly, the same magnitude of levitation force was achieved in a much shorter time in samples quenched during the modified process. Further, this process modification enabled a single do main growth over the entire sample thickness of 0.5&quot;, which could not be achieved by the slow cooling process. This research was sponsored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.

HIGH CRITICAL CURRENTS IN HIGH-ANGLE GRAIN BOUNDARIES IN YBCO SUPERCONDUCTOR:</B> <I>K. Salama</I>, S. Sathyamurthy, A.S. Parikh, Texas Center for Superconductivity, 3201 Cullen Blvd., University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204-5769<P>
A serious limitation to applications of YBCO superconductors is the presence of weak links in the form of grain boundaries. The high resistivity of YBCO grain boundaries is mainly attributed to the presence of solidified liquid phase and cracks at these boundaries. Using the liquid phase removal method, YBCO melt textured bars, over 10 cm in length and 0.5 cm2 in cross-section, are processed with &quot;clean&quot; grain boundaries free of secondary phases and cracks. Bars processed by this method are found to consist of several large domains separated by clean grain boundaries. The bars are polycrystalline in nature with an average of 5 grain boundaries for every one cm in length. Using transport current measurements, the bars are found to carry currents in excess of 1000 Amps (current limit of source available) at 77 K and self field with very small voltage drop (20 to 50 &#181;V). Also, the same effect persists in the presence of external magnetic field up to 1.5 T at 77K. Contrary to previous findings, the misorientation angles of grain boundaries in these samples are found to be significantly high, ranging between 30&#176; and 80&#176;. These results indicate that the high angle grain boundaries in these bars are capable of sustaining very large currents and therefore make them suitable for applications such as current leads and current limiters.

The production of dense superconducting ceramics is affected by the thermal processing and parameters like the oxygenation process and the texture development. One of the serious problems which prevents the formation of useful REBa2Cu3O7-x-like bulk ceramics (RE = rare earth) for practical applications is the existence of weak links at the grain boundaries. Another annoying feature is that all usual containers or substrates for the growth react with the melt leading to a strong contamination of the &quot;in situ&quot; produced materials. The choice of the substrate is also very relevant for film growth. The cases of SrTiO3, MgO, Al2O3, and BaZrO3 crucibles for solution growth of single crystals of REBa2Cu3O7 has been investigated for the production of long length fibers or other complicated shapes of bulk Y or RE-123 materials. The chemical compatibility of the &quot;substrate&quot; towards the Y or RE-123 mixture is reported at various melt-texturing growth stages. For comparison, we looked at three different materials: BaZrO3, SrTiO3, and MgO.

MACROSEGREGATION OF 211 PARTICLES DURING ZONE MELT TEXTURING OF Y123:</B> H. Balwada, <I>P.J. McGinn</I>, Dept. of Chemical Engr., Univ. of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556<P>
The phenomenon of 211 particle pushing by the solidification front during zone melt texturing has been studied. In the presence of second phase additions of PtO2 and BaCeO3, 211 particle refinement occurs. This refinement results in macroscopic segregation of 211 particles to the periphery of the sample rod. This phenomenon has been observed in samples textured with additions of PtO2 (.2 wt% and .5 wt%) and BaCeO3 (2 wt%) at speeds of 0.5 mm/hr and 1mm/hr. Without additions to refine the 211, this phenomenon is not observed. It was also found that higher texturization speeds lead to multiple grain nucleation at the solid/liquid interface. Particle pushing continues to take place under these circumstances, as long as the growth mechanism does not become dendritic, in which case this phenomenon is not observed. Effects of various solidification parameters on the extent of 211 particle segregation will be discussed.

A thermodynamic approach has been applied to the processing of rare earth barium cuprate superconductors (ReBCO). Studies were made on various ReBCO thick films which had been screen-printed onto Ag substrates. Using a coulometric titration technique, thermodynamic studies and reduced temperature and pressure (RTP) processing methods were carried out the thick film samples of ReBCO/Ag. The parameters governing the melt processing of ReBCO/Ag were optimised with a knowledge of phase stabilities and phase relations with respect to both temperature and oxygen partial pressure. Furthermore, accurate control of the oxygen partial pressure enabled the determination of the phase chemistry and the crystal growth rates during processing.

Fault current limiters (FCL) have the potential of becoming one of the first major applications for high temperature superconductors. To improve commercial confidence in high temperature superconductivity, it is imperative that superconductors are produced and tested in certain applications. In this work, melt processed YBCO rings have been produced for use in an inductive fault current limiter. Various dopants and thermal treatments are utilized to improve the mechanical, electrical, and magnetic properties of the material. Using the FCL, critical current density (Jc) measurements can be made. Several different arrangements of the components of the FCL and the limiting performance are outlined. Characterization of the material is performed using polarized light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and pulsed Jc measurements. The final aim of this work is to determine whether bulk YBCO is suitable for use in inductive fault current limiters.

High critical temperature (high-Tc) superconductors have captured the interest of engineers and scientists world wide. For its commercial utilization in the field of microelectronics and electronic systems, they must be fabricated into desirable configurations - thin and thick films. During studies, it has been observed that these superconducting thin films operating at liquid N2 temperature offer great possibilities for faster, more sensitive and precise electronics devices. Present paper reviews the fabrication techniques of high-Tc superconducting thin films which primarily includes pulsed laser deposition, molecular ion beam epitaxy, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) by using epitaxial growth on single crystal substrates (YSZ, MgO, Si, etc.) with excellent microstructural control and properties relationship. In addition to it, thick film fabrication is also discussed with major techniques like screen printing and plasma spraying along with associated processing parameters. Furthermore, advanced applications of each are enumerated at length.

Atoms in amorphous alloys are combined into a configuration of minimizing the local energy in the short-range structure instead of relaxing the total energy minimum of a system. The short-range order of amorphous alloys often shows similarity to that of their crystalline counterparts. The survival of the local coordination in amorphous alloys is also confirmed by the vibrational density-of-states. However, the medium-range structure of amorphous alloys has an quite unique nature in contrast to the crystalline alloys. The low-energy excitation in amorphous alloys appearing in the energy range of 1 to 3 meV, which is usually observed as an excess specific heat in addition to the Debye-type harmonic vibration, is contributed from the locally collective motion characterized spatially by the medium-range structure fluctuations. The experimental results mentioned above for Pd-Si, Pd-Ge, Pd-Ni-P and V-Ni amorphous alloys were observed by pulsed neutron scattering based on accelerators, which is a powerful tool for characterizing the structure of amorphous alloys, because a very wide dynamic range of energy- and momentum-transfer can be surveyed.

NEUTRON DIFFRACTION STUDIES OF LIQUID ZINTL-ALLOYS UP TO 2000:</B> <I>K.R. Winter</I>, University of Dortmund, Department of Chemistry, Physical Chemistry I, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany<P>
Neutron diffraction measurements have been carried out on equiatomic liquid Zntl-alloys, such as KPb, CsPb, and NaSn, over a wide temperature interval, ranging from 800 to 2000 K, and at pressures up to 150 bar. In the crystalline state, these are semiconducting compounds containing tetrahedrally coordinated polyanions. The diffraction results indicate the survival of polyanions in the expanded liquid alloys even up to high temperatures, as indicated by the persistence of the peak of S(Q) at Q<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/approx-equal.gif">1&Aring;-1, which is indicative of intermediate-range order. The position of this peak shifts towards lower Q-values, its height decreases, and its width drastically increases with increasing temperature and correspondingly decreasing density. The experimental results and the corresponding real-space information are compared with the crystal structures in the solid state and with the results of recent ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations and computer modelling studies. In addition, we present neutron diffraction data on the effect of pressure on the structure factor of solid CsPb in the rotator phase.

The crystallization of amorphous materials has been studied extensively during the last two decades. However, the formation of nanocrystals - that is a crystalline morphology with an average grain size of 5 to 50 nm - from t he amorphous state has been detected few years ago. Since that time it is used more and more. This procedure is performed isothermally below the crystallization temperature. We present data of the kinetics of this process. The transformation has been monitored by the measurement of several physical properties; we have applied especially the measurement of magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic measurements are able to detect the onset of the transformation of amorphous Ni-P alloys much earlier than was possible with differential scanning calorimetry. The transformation kinetics can be analyzed by means of the Avrami plot based on the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation. The kinetics of further solid state reactions in the nanostructured material can be investigated similarly.

The volume interdiffusion has been studied in Fe-Si single crystals in the vicinity of A2-B2 ordering and in Cu-Au single crystals in the vicinity of Al-L12 ordering. Decreased interdiffusivity rates were found, as expected, in the ordered Fe-Si alloys. In the Cu-Au alloys, however, the interdiffusivity in the ordered region is higher than it could be expected by extrapolation of the diffusivities in the disordered phase. Different approaches were used to calculate the thermodynamic factor for interdiffusion, and the results obtained are in qualitative agreement with the experimental data. The influence of the variation of the partial molar volumes of the components during the phase transition on the calculated interdiffusivities is discussed.

THE METASTABLE STATE OF AMORPHOUS ALLOYS:</B> <I>R. Bormann</I>, Institute for Materials Research, GKSS Research Center, D-21494 Geesthacht, Germany<P>
In the past, the thermodynamic state of amorphous phases has been of great concern. Due to highly non-equilibrium preparation processes involving rapid quenching and condensation techniques it has been assumed that these alloys are frozen-in liquids where a thermodynamic description cannot be applied. Recently however, the existence of a metastable state in single-phase and phase-separated amorphous alloys has been confirmed unambiguously by electromotive force (EMF) measurements and characterized by calorimetric and structural investigations. EMF measurements also allow the direct determination of the chemical potentials of the least noble component and thereby (for binary systems) the Gibbs energy of the amorphous phase. By means of thermodynamic modeling, e.g. by the CALPHAD method, phase diagrams of metastable phases can be calculated for the amorphous phase. These can predict the amorphous phase formation during rapid quenching of the melt and during solid-state reactions. The results demonstrate that the formation of amorphous alloys is strongly determined by the thermodynamics of the undercooled liquid and the amorphous phase.

Nanostructured ceramic AlN materials are fabricated using chemical routes. The precursor powders of aluminum hydroxide are synthesized by hydrolysis of aluminum tri sec butoxide. These precursor powders are calcined and subsequently transformed to nanoscale AlN powders by nitriding in an ammonia environment furnace at temperatures to 1100&#176;C. The AlN powders are consolidated to green bodies by cold isostatic pressing. The green bodies are sintered in a nitrogen furnace for densification. Characterization techniques include XRD, TEM, HRTEM, DSC, and surface FTIR. The effects of solvent, pH on the control of particle size, particle size distribution and agglomeration are addressed.

Spray freezing of multicomponent aqueous solutions followed by freeze drying leads to formation of homogeneous salt powders with stable and extensive porous structure. The influence of specific microstructure on the properties of fine powders obtained by thermal decomposition of these precursors remains underestimated. Indeed the decomposition of the native freeze dried salt precursor resulted in the formation of single phase LiCoO2 at T=300&#176;C while breaking the aggregates before decomposition led to multiphase product. In the other case carefully controlled influence on the microstructure of the intermediates allowed us to accelerate 3-5 times the rate of grain growth during annealing of Fe2O3 and BaZrO3 fine powders.

Composite particles, which are expected as raw materials for composite, are often prepared by alkoxide method or homogeneous precipitation method. However, using these methods, it seems to be rather difficult to control structure of the coating layer (ex. multi-layered, homogeneously mixed, graduated layered). From this point of view, the presenters tried to prepare composite particles by injecting raw material solution into a dispersion of core particles (diameter: micro meter order). The presenters believe that this method will make it easier to control the structure of coating layer. In this presentation, preparation of alumina-hydrate coated SiC whiskers is investigated. We used SiC whiskers as core particles and aluminum salt (nitrate, chloride, sulfate) solution as raw material solution, relationships between preparation conditions (injection speed, concentration of core particles etc.) and morphology of coated particles were explored. Moreover, application of this method for preparation of double-layer coated particles will be presented.

Experiments were performed to synthesize AlN powders by reacting Al with N using a conventional dc-plasma as a heat source. Attempts to form AlN powders by feeding Al powder into a nitrogen-rich plasma open to the atmosphere produced mainly aluminum oxide. Subsequent experiments were run inside a chamber which was backfilled with nitrogen. The nitrogen environment suppressed the formation of aluminum oxide, but little AlN was formed by using Al powder as the feedstock material. A furnace and crucible assembly was designed to feed molten Al directly into a convergent nozzle positioned directly at the face of the dc-plasma gun. Powders formed using this arrangement show a significant increase in the level of AlN formation. The presence of AlN was verified by chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction. Results were dependent upon chamber pressure, plasma velocity and molten liquid feed rate. The experimental parameters, equipment design and results will be reported in detail, and a suggested reaction mechanism will be discussed.

The synthesis of ultrafine alumina and zirconia powders by mechanochemical reaction has been investigated using x-ray diffraction, TEM and DSC measurements. Mechanical milling of AlCl3 or ZrCl4 with CaO resulted in nanoscale mixtures of the starting phases, with no evidence of the occurrence of any reaction during milling. The formation of separated 10-20 nm particles of g-Al2O3 within a CaCl2 matrix occurred after heat treating the as-milled AlCl3/CaO mixture above 350&#176;C. Cubic ZrO2, particles 5-10 nm in diameter, were formed after heat treatment above 300&#176;C. With both reactions, removal of the CaCl2 by-product phase was carried out using an appropriate solvent.

The so called soft chemistry approach is usually based on hydrolytic or pyrolytic decomposition of the complexes of metals with organic ligands. The methoxides of rhenium (I), rhenium and molybdenum (II) and rhenium and tungsten (III) were prepared by anodic oxidation of rhenium metal in methanol in the presence of LiCl as electrolyte and methoxides of countermetals. Acetylacetonate, Re2O5(acac)2 (IV) was obtained by interaction of re2O7 and Hacac in toluene. I and III are insoluble in common organic solvents and air stable in contrast to highly soluble and air and moisture sensitive II. IV is insoluble in hydrocarbons and dissolves in ethers with decomposition. All these compounds are volatile at reduced pressure and decompose in inert atmosphere into mixed low-valent oxides or, in case of IV, into rhenium metal.

The catalytic properties of supported rhenium were widely investigated in the reactions of de, hydrogenation, hydrogenation of hydrocarbons and reforming of petrol fractions. Lowpercentage bimetallic supported catalysts containing rhenium and palladium have been developed. A world first publication of these results were in 1960's - a little bit earlier than known Pt - Re reforming catalysts. An effective catalyst, rhenium heptasulfide has been found in the chemical synthesis of S - and N - containing heterocycles compounds. It is a specific selective catalyst for the hydrogenation of the pyridine ring without affecting the benzene ring in aryl-substituted pyridines, including those containing silicon, isoquinolines, annelated pyridine and condensed aromatic compounds. The process of hydrogenation in the presence of alcohols is going on along with N - alkylation on rhenium heptasulfide. Selective hydrogenation of various number of physiologically active substances, containing a pyridine ring could afford some alkaloids and their analogs.

Rhenium speciations in various solutions, which are important for process and analytical chemistry have been studied for many years. Model systems, containing Rhenium, different ligands and reductors, equilibrium diagrams of Rhenium compounds were studied. Analytical forms of Rhenium compounds and their properties (oxidative-reductive, complexability, catalytical and etc.), their composition, structure, mechanism and reaction kinetics with the used of WMS, IR, ESR, NMR and kinetic spectroscopy methods were revelated. Effective analytical systems were discovered on the basis of these investigations. Perspective methods of optical and potentiometrical sensors, catalytic methods for cone. of alkaline and acid medias with detection limit down to 0.001 &#181;gRe/ml, coulometric method for mg Re determination, ICPAES, luminescence, thermochromatographical, spectrophotometric, ESR and other methods were developed. Some of them are in use as FIA detectors. New sorbents, watersoluable polymers with membrane filtration, electrodialysis and electromigration appeared to be the base for effective isolation and preconcentration of Rhenium. Express-testing methods, based on the catalytic properties of &quot;unusual&quot; state of oxidation Rhenium - Re (VI), were created and applied for analytical control on several manufactures (limit of detection up to 0.001 &#181;g/ml). The developed methods comprise the basis of analytical control during the reworking of Rhenium-containing ores, technological rests, waste Re-Pt catalysators, volcanic products from Kurila Islands, being used in field conditions, and also for geochronology by Re/Os isotop ratio.

DEFORMATION BEHAVIOUR OF 7075AL/ SICP COMPOSITE DURING MULTIPASS DEFORMATION AT HIGH TEMPERATURES: </B> A. Razaghian, D. Yu, T. Chandra, Department of Materials Engineering, Wollongong University, Wollongong, NSW, 2522, Australia<P>

Hot deformation behaviour of 7075 aluminium alloy containing 15 vol% of SiC particles (average size of 14 am) and the monolithic alloy was studied at 300 and 400&#176;C at constant strain rate of ls-1 under condition of uniaxial compression. The effect of delay between two consecutive passes on the high temperature mechanical strength and microstructural development was examined. The results showed that the fractional softening (%FS) increased in both reinforced and monolithic alloys when the deformation temperature increased from 300 to 400&#176;C, but monolithic alloy showed a slightly higher FS compared to composite under identical deformation conditions. TEM examination revealed that the monolithic alloy and composite contained almost similar substructures after either single or double pass deformation at a given temperature irrespective of interpass hold time. However, some subgrain growth was observed in these materials during holding after deformation at 400&#176;C, but this was not the case at 300&#176;C. The absence of subgrain growth at lower temperature can be attributed to pinning effect by fine dispersions present in the matrix. The structural study also showed that static recrystallization did not occur in these materials during hold time between passes, and the fractional softening occurs mainly due to static recovery.

WEAR PROPERTIES OF PARTICULATE REINFORCED ALUMINUM ALLOYS:</B> <I>Yeong-gi Cho</I>, Su-young Kim, Ikmin Park, Kyungmox Cho, Dept. of Metallurgical Eng. Pusan National University, Pusan 609735, Korea<P>
Wear properties of cast AlSiCp composites were characterized under dry and lubricated conditions. Wear tests were performed employing blockonroller type and pinondisk type machines. Test conditions including applied load, sliding speed and sliding distance were changed for wear tests. Wear behavior was investigated by analyzing worn surfaces and debris, mainly as a function of the sliding speed. Results show that there exist transition speeds at which the minimum wear rate occurs for both dry and lubricated conditions. However the appearance of wear transition is not well defined for the lubricated wear. It was found that SiCp reinforcement affects wear at the low sliding speeds and the softening of Al matrix dominates wear at the high sliding speeds. Main wear mechanism is abrasive wear although some amounts of adhesive wear are observed especially at the high sliding speeds.

FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH BEHAVIOR OF DIECAST AND CAST SiC PARTICULATES REINFORCED ALUMINUM COMPOSITES:</B> Song-Hee Kim, Iee-Jeoung Kim, Department of Materials Engineering, Kangwon National University, Chunchon, Kangwondo, Korea, 200701<P>
The fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) of SiC particulates reinforced aluminum matrix composites containing 10vol.% and 20vol.% of SiC fabricated by the casting and the die-casting processes have been studied over a wide range of stress intensity factor for various load ratios. The effect of volume fraction of SiC on FCGR was also investigated for the diecast and cast composites. Fracture toughness was found to affect the fatigue crack growth behavior at the higher level of stress intensity factor range; however, at lower level, fatigue crack roughness related with the volume fraction of SiC reinforcement was more responsible for the fatigue crack growth. Diecast composite with 20vol.% of SiC showed the superior fatigue crack propagation resistance at the lower level of AK, but the inferior resistance at the higher level of AK due to the decreased ductility and fracture toughness.

HIGH STRAIN RATE SUPERPLASTICITY OF DISCONTINUOUS FIBER REINFORCED PUR ALUMINUM COMPOSITES:</B> Tsunemichi Imai, Sumito Kojima, Isao Tochigi, Gilles L'Esperance, Bande Hong, Daming Jiang; National Industrial Research Institute of Nagoya, Hirate-cho, Kita-ku, Nagoya 462, Japan; Nagoy Minucipal Industrial Research Institute, 4-3-4 Rokuban-cho, Atsuta-ku, Nagoya 456, Japan; Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, PO Box 6079, Station A, Montreal (Quebec) Canada; Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China<P>

High Strain Rate Superplasticity (HSRS) of metal matrix composite has a great potential to apply to components and structures in automobile and aerospace industries and even semi-conductor packings since the composites exhibits excellent mechanical, physical and thermal properties. IN90 pure aluminum (Al) alone and AlN/1N90 pure Al composite made by PM method, and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">-Si3N4w/99.99% pure Al composite fabricated by squeeze casting were hot-rolled after extrusion and the superplastic characteristics were investigated to clarify the deformation mechanism. IN90 Al alone hot-rolled about 773K could produce the m value of more than 0.3 and 300~450% at the strain rate of about 0.01s-1 and at 913~923K and also has threshold stress in the strain rate less than 0.01s-1. <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">-Si3N4w/99.9% pure Al composite exhibits the m value of 0.47 and the total elongation of about 200% at the strain rate of 0.5s-1 and at 903K. The results indicate that the HSRS could occur by grain boundary sliding without interfacial sliding at liquid phase, because the optimum temperature to produce the HSRS is just below incipient melting temperature.

FRACTURE BEHAVIOR OF COBALT COATED Al203 SHORT FIBER REINFORCED 2024 Al COMPOSITE:</B> K.H. Baik*, E.S. Lee, and <I>S.

The effect of chemical reaction at coating/fiber interface on the fracture behavior of 2024 Al alloy reinforced with Co coated Al2O3 fibers were investigated. Al2O3 fibers were coated with metallic Co by solgel process using Co acetate compound. The coated fibers were annealed at temperatures ranging from 300 to 1000&#176;C in vacuum to generate interfacial reaction between the Co coating and the Al2O3 fiber. Regardless of the annealing temperatures, a fair amount of solute Co was detected near the Al2O3 fiber surface ensuring the good bonding between the coating and the fiber. AlgCO2 and Co203 phases were formed at high annealing temperatures. SEM fractography of the composite showed the change of fracture behavior as a result of the interfacial reaction. Fiber debonding was frequently observed in the composite rein
 forced with fibers annealed at low temperatures. On the other hand, the composite with fibers annealed at higher temperatures had improved tensile strength, and showed much smaller dimples around the fibers and relatively less fiber pull-out. In-situ SEM fracture study was performed to understand the micro fractureprocess of the composite.

Varma, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968-0520<P>
The influence of solutionizing time and temperature on the microstructural development and bonding characteristics between the matrix and the particles will be characterized in composites with 6061 and 2014 aluminum alloys reinforced with 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20 volume fractions of Ai2O 3 particles (VFAP) solutionized at 520, 530, and 540&#176;C for different times up to 20 hours to produce various grain sizes after quenching. The different heat treated samples after solutionizing v,/ill be subjected to room temperature tensile fracture at various strain rates (attainable in an Instron tensile testing machine) and the fracture surfaces will be characterized by SEM and related to the UTS. The samples deformed to various true strains will be analyzed in the TEM to determine the influence of solutionizing time on the microstructural development during the deformation. The results on the composites will be compared with similar treatments performed on the alloys in their monolithic forms in order to determine the deformation mechanisms in the composites.

The hot deformation behavior of 15 vol.% (SiCw + SiCP.) reinforced AA2124 composites was investigated by hot torsion tests. The AA2124 Al based composites with different volume fractions of SiCw and SiCP reinforcements were fabricated by the powder metallurgy. Detailed analyses of flow curves and deformed microstructures were made to identify the hot restoration mechanism, such as dynamic recrystallization or dynamic recovery. Also, the dependence of flow stress and ductility on temperature and strain rate was studied. From the flow curves and microstructures of the hot deformed composites, it has been found that dynamic recrystallization was responsible for the hot restoration of the composites. The flow stress of the hybrid composites was higher than that of the monolithic AA2124 alloy. The flow stress and ductility of the hybrid composites were investigated with respect to the ratio of SiCw and SiCP, reinforcements.

ANALYSIS OF RESIDUAL STRESSED IN Ti-ALLOY, SCS-x MMC's BY NANOINDENTATION:</B> K.L. Kendig, R. Gibala, D.B. Miracle, B.S.

Knowledge of variation of residual stresses aids in prediction of composite deformation and failure. Hardness measurements with high spatial resolution using extremely low load indentations, such as by nanoindentation techniques, may be an indicator of such variation of residual stresses. In this work, nanoindentation was used to determine hardness as a function of radial position from a fiber for a Ti6Al-4V, SCS-6 SiC fiber composite and a Ti-15V-3Al-3Cr-3Sn, SCS-0 SiC fiber composite, each in the as-consolidated condition. Residual stress predictions from a finite element model were compared to the hardness distributions obtained by nanoindentation. A small difference in nanoindentation hardness was found between the two phases of the Ti-6Al-4V matrix in the Ti-6Al-4V, SCS-6 composite, which likely masked any effects of residual stress on hardness. The Ti-15V-3Al-3Cr-3Sn, SCS-0 system was chosen to avoid this complication and to allow more direct correlation between predicted residual stress and nanoindentation hardness.

THE EFFECT OF THICKNESS AND TOTAL SULFUR CONTENT ON PWA1480 OXIDATION: A SCALE ADHESION MAP: </B> <I>J.L. Smialek</I>, NASA Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH 44135<P>
The cyclic oxidation resistance of advanced superalloys is dramatically improved when the typical sulfur impurity levels are reduced from about 3-10 ppmw to below 1 ppmw. Optimum scale adhesion can be obtained when the sulfur content is reduced below a discreet critical level. To demonstrate this phenomenon, coupons of PWA1480 were desulfurized by a hydrogen annealing process. The degree of desulfurization was controlled by sample thickness and annealing time and temperature, but did not strictly follow a Dt/L2 diffusion parameter dependency. From an initial sulfur value of 6 ppmw, 15 different sulfur levels were produced ranging from 0.05 to 4 ppmw. Cyclic oxidation resistance in 1100&#176;C tests improved directly with the degree of desulfurization, reaching an optimum below about 0.2 ppmw. Furthermore, at equivalent sulfur levels, thick samples were prone to greater weight loss than thin samples. The results are discussed in terms of an adhesion map based on the equivalent number of interfacially segregated monolayers of sulfur.

Steam has been proposed as an efficient cooling medium for the hot section components in the advanced gas turbines as an option for more efficient cooling allowing them to operate at higher efficiency. However, the effects of steam and its impurities such as NaCl and Na2SO4 on the environmental degradation of gas turbine superalloys is little known. Three common gas turbine superalloys; X-45, IN-738 and Inconel-617 were exposed to steam at higher temperature. Cylindrical specimens with central bore were kept at elevated temperature and exposed to three steam environments flowing through the bore. The three environments are (a) steam generated from deionized water, (b) steam generated from deionized water with 5ppm each of NaCl and Na2SO4 and (c) steam generated from deionized water with 50ppm each of NaCl and Na2SO4. The respective exposure times were 1450, 2950 and 3900 hours. IN-738 showed severe internal oxidation in steam without contaminants. In contaminated steam the hot corrosion damage was maximum in Inconel-617. X-45 showed less oxidation damage than IN-738 and less hot corrosion than Inconel-617.

During service blades and vanes of stationary gas turbines are subjected to high temperatures. The increase in surface temperatures causes a more severe attack on the MCrAlY-coatings. These coatings are taken for bond coats for thermal barrier coatings as well. The production of a homogeneous oxide layer during service is necessary for a good oxidation protection and for a good adhesion to the ceramic. We will present in-situ X-ray measurements on 8% and 12% Al containing MCrAlY-coatings with and without Re at three different temperatures versus time. At lower temperatures mainly a two phase mixture of Cr2O3 and Al2O3 is detectable with different size distributions for the coatings with 8% and 12% Al. On microsections the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">-phase depletion is analyzed. At 1050&#176;C a pure Al2O3 oxide layer is established. No Re can be found in the top layer.

THE EFFECT OF RHODIUM WEIGHT PERCENT ON THE OXIDATION RESISTANCE OF PLATINUM RHODIUM MODIFIED ALUMINIDE COATINGS ON MAR M-509 AND FSX-414 COBALT BASE ALLOYS:  </B> <I>J. Kimmel</I>, Z. Mutasim, Solar Turbines, Inc., 2200 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92186-5376<P>
Cobalt based alloys such as Mar-M 509 and FSX-414 are coated with a precious metal aluminide (platinum-rhodium-aluminide) to provide enhanced oxidation and hot corrosion resistance in gas turbine applications. The role of rhodium in the aluminide coating is not well understood. There is limited data suggesting that it provides added oxide adherence and reduced refractory element diffusion from the base alloy too the coating interface, thus reducing the tendency of spallation during high temperature exposure. However, too high of a rhodium content decreases the ductility of the coating and, after cyclic oxidation, may result in coating cracking and spallation. The objective of this study is to evaluate platinum-rhodium-aluminide optimum rhodium weight percentage on Mar-M 509 and FSX-414 cobalt based alloys. Metallurgical evaluation was performed on platinum rhodium aluminide coatings with varying rhodium weight variation between 0% and 10%. Oxidation tests were performed at 2000&#176;F/1000 hours, 2100&#176;F/1000 hours (100 hour cycles). Characteristics such as coating thickness, composition, microstructure, and weight changes were evaluated for the as-coated and oxidized specimens using SEM and EDX analysis.

An improvement in the cooling of hot gas path components of the has turbines has been sought by replacing air with steam as a cooling medium. However the materials problems associated with steam at high temperature are unknown for gas turbine superalloys. This information is very crucial for the reliability and life prediction of the gas turbine components. In this study, oxidation in steam has been studied for four nickel based superalloys commonly used in the gas turbines, IN738, Inconel 617 and CMSX-4. The study was carried out at four different test temperatures within the range of 800&#176;C to 950&#176;C for times up to 1400 hours. The oxidation tests were also carried out in air to provide a comparison between the oxidation in steam and air. The results indicated higher internal oxidation in IN738 compared to other two alloys. The oxidation attack observed in IN738 was higher in steam compared to air, whereas in other alloys reverse was the case.

In-service environmental attack and mechanical degradation of CoNiCrAlY coatings in gas turbine blades have been investigated using a scanning Auger microprobe (SAM) analysis and small punch (SP) testing technique. Coating degradation was found to strongly depend on the location of blades operated for 21000h under liquefied natural gas. SAM analyses revealed extensive formation of AlN and Ni enriched in inner (concave) coatings but not in outer (convex) ones. The oxidation and carbonization also occurred more substantially in near surface regions of the inner coating. SP specimens were prepared from the inner and outer coatings in order that the specimen surface could be located near surface or interface coatings. SP tests demonstrated that the oxidation and nitridation in the inner coating produce significant mechanical degradation. Brittle cracking in the inner coating occurred at low strains (&lt;3%) up to 950&#176;C though near interface coatings showed a little higher ductility. The outer coatings near the surface and interface showed higher RT ductility (&gt;6%) than the substrate and a rapid increase in the ductility above 800&#176;C. The coating degradation mechanism is discussed in light of the distribution of operating temperatures.

The high temperature diffusion and oxidation behavior of electro-deposited Ni matrix/Al particle coatings was studied to determine the relationships between coating microstructure and high temperature behavior. The coatings, containing up to approximately 20 vol. % Al particles, were deposited on nickel substrates and heat treated at 635, 800, and 1000&#176;C for up to 100 hours. Upon heat treatment at 635 and 800&#176;C, a two phase structure of Ni3Al (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1) and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> solid solution develops with small Kirkendall voids also present. At 1000&#176;C, the coating contains only a solid solution in agreement with the Ni-Al phase diagram. The microhardness of the coating was found to increase with increasing Nail content. Both as-plated and heat treated coatings were oxidation tested in air at 800, 900, and 1000&#176;C for up to 900 hours. Results indicate that the Al content is sufficient to form a protective Al2O3 scale on the coatings during isothermal exposure at these temperatures.

Niobium aluminide intermetallics can exhibit attractive combination of high-temperature strength retention and room-temperature ductility/damage tolerance. Preliminary studies have also shown that niobium aluminides have moderate oxidation resistance at temperatures up to ~750&#176;C in the uncoated condition. However, their oxidation kinetics are not fully understood. In this study, the high-temperature oxidation resistance of niobium aluminide intermetallics (Nb-15Al-10Ti, Nb-15Al-25Ti, Nb-15Al-40Ti and Nv-12.5Al-41Ti-1.5Mo) was studied using uncoated and coated alloys. Protective coatings were formed via in-situ chemical reactions designed to promote the siliciding an aluminizing of Mo and Ni substrate layers, respectively. The isothermal and cyclic oxidation behavior of coated and uncoated materials in air were then studied in the temperature range between 650 and 850&#176;C. The oxide scales and internal layers were analyzed using XRD, SEM and EDX. The implications of the results are assessed for potential high-temperature applications of niobium aluminide intermetallics.

ELECTRO-SPARK ALLOYED HEAT RESISTANT COATINGS ON THE WC-CO BASE: </B> <I>A.D. Verkhoturov</I>, S.V. Nikolenko, N.V. Lebukhova, Institute of Materials of Russian Academy of Sciences, Khabarovsk, Russia<P>
Electro-spark alloying of the metallic surfaces is one of the most perspective coating technologies, among the many other current coating processes. The main advantages of this method include the possibility of depositing any current conducting materials on the surface; high adhesive strength of the layer, and the simplicity of the process. Electro-spark coatings usually have a relatively low continuity of 60-90%; defects (pores, microfractures), heterophase structure. In spite of that, it is possible to achieve, by using refractory alloys as electrodes, a stable effect of increasing heat-resistance. The research conducted by the Institute of Material Science of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Khabarovsk, Russia) showed that electrode materials which examine increasing heat-resistance, can be put in the following order (based on the main component): boride-carbide-nitride. The highest hardness (20-24 GPa) and wear resistance among coatings on steel, is achieved with a hard alloy with tungsten carbide-cobalt base (WC-92%, Co-8%). For increasing Wc-Co alloy electro-spark coatings', deposited on the parts working in high temperature and wear conditions, resistance to high-temperature oxidizing, we propose including self-fluxing materials or heat-resistant intermetallics in the alloy. The research in new materials, that include additives of Ni-Cr-B-Si and Ni3Al (0, 5-25%) to the Wc-Co alloy, was also conducted. We have studied the characteristics of macro- and microstructure of materials and coatings, as well as their chemical compositions, electrode material transfer kinetics, and the optimal conditions of alloying the surfaces. Kinetics of high-temperature oxidizing and phase composition of the interaction products, were examined using a differential thermal analysis in non-isothermal conditions method.

Because of accidental beam loss and continual halo losses along the acceleration path, the concern of the degradation of the superconducting properties with accumulated irradiation arises. Residual-resistivity-ratio (RRR) specimens of Nb, with a range of initial RRR's, were irradiated at room temperature at energies from 200 MeV to 2000 MeV. Four-probe resistance measurements were made at room temperature and at 4.2 K both prior and after irradiations. Proton fluences ranged from 5 x 1014 to about 5 x 1016 p/cm2. These room-temperature results simulate the resistance changes to be expected in LINAC operation for the cavities having been exposed to the radiation and then cycled through an anneal to room temperature. The defect structures produced have been characterized using both scanning and transmission microscopy. Implications of the results to proposed cavity operation and recent results on cavity irradiations will be presented.

Radiation damage is considered to be the most critical load for the lifetime of components in or close to the proton beam penetrating the target of high power spallation sources. Specimens irradiated in operating medium-power spallation devices are at present the only source of <B>direct </B> information on the behavior of materials in a spallation environment. Within an international cooperation, the following specimens will be investigated in the hot cells at KFA J&uuml;lich: (1) A hemispherical LAMPF window made of INCONEL 718, (2) A spherical LAMPF water degrader made of INCONEL 718 and 316 SS, (3) Two curved PSI windows made of DIN 1.4926 SS and irradiated in LAMPF, and (4) A complete target from ISIS consisting of Ta plates in a 304 SS housing. After cutting and preparation of different types of miniaturized specimens the following tests will be performed: 3 point bending tests, ball punch tests, microhardness measurements, scanning (and possibly transmission) electron microscopy, and tensile tests (only for ISIS specimens where ample material is available).

SIMULATION IRRADIATIONS OF TARGET AND STRUCTURE COMPONENTS FOR SPALLATION NEUTRON SOURCES:</B> <I>E. Camus</I>, N. Wanderka, H. Wollenberger, Hahn-Meitner-Institut, D-14109 Berlin, Germany<P>
Beside damage levels up to 10 dpa per month, the spallation reaction induces high levels of transmutation products, mainly hydrogen (up to 0.5 at.% per month) and helium (up to 0.1 at.% per month). Dual-beam irradiations with heavy ions, protons, and/or helium ions with energies up to 300 keV make it possible to introduce such damage levels and high hydrogen or helium contents within hours. We present experimental results on the microstructure evolution and on mechanical properties of simulation irradiated steels and tantalum. The cavity microstructure is investigated by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Field-ion microscopy with atom probe (FIM-AP) shows fine scale radiation-induced segregation. Hardness measurements on specimens implanted at low temperature with heavy ions, protons, and/or helium have been performed and reveal a drastic increase of hardness. Both the displacement rate and the hydrogen or helium implantation rate used in simulation irradiations are orders of magnitude higher than those produced in spallation environments. Data correlation, with special emphasis on the influence of the hydrogen or helium implantation rate, is discussed.

The unique Triple Ion-Beam Facility (TIF) at ORNL allows researchers to mimic significant features of the NSNS irradiation environment by producing displacement damage and injecting He and H simultaneously. In this work, therefore, austenitic EC316LN and ferritic 9Cr2WVTa alloys were irradiated using the TIF to investigate radiation damage effects. Irradiations were carried out using 4 MeV Fe++, 400 keV He+, and 200 keV H+ simultaneously to accumulate 50 dpa, 10,000 appm He, and 50,000 appm H, respectively. Irradiations were carried out at temperatures from 50 to 200&#176;C. The specific ion energies were chosen to maximize the damage and the gas accumulation at the same depth of ~1 &#181;m. Microstructure and surface hardness of irradiated specimens were evaluated by TEM and the Nanoindenter, respectively. This report summarizes damage microstructure as a function of irradiation depth from cross-sectioned TEM specimens and hardness variation of the bombarded surfaces.

IRRADIATION DAMAGE OF FERRITIC/MARTENSITIC STEELS: FUSION PROGRAM DATA APPLIED TO THE SPALLATION NEUTRON SOURCE APPLICATION:</B> R.L. Klueh, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6376<P>
Ferritic/martensitic steels in the target structure of a spallation neutron source will experience many of the extreme conditions expected in a fusion power plant (i.e., high-energy neutrons that produce large amounts of displacement damage and transmutation helium). Thus, studies of the steels for fusion are relevant for the spallation neutron source application. The ferritic/martensitic steels are candidates for fusion because of superior swelling resistance, better liquid-metal compatibility, higher thermal conductivity, and lower thermal expansion than austenitic steels. The major problem with ferritic/martensitic steels involves the effect of irradiation on fracture, as determined by a Charpy impact test. Fast reactor irradiation produces an increase in the ductile-brittle transition temperature and decrease in the upper-shelf energy. The effect saturates with fluence for fast-reactor irradiation, but the saturation values observed for irradiation in a fast reactor do not apply for irradiation in a mixed-spectrum reactor under conditions where transmutation helium is generated simultaneously with displacement damage. This helium effect is one of the critical issues that needs to be understood, since high helium concentrations will be generated in conjunction with the displacement damage in a fusion reactorand in the target of a spallation neutron source, should a ferritic/martensitic steel be chosen for that application.

Linacs are proposed for spallation neutron sources which are capable of relatively high beam currents. Associated with the transport of these high currents will be relatively high beam losses to the linac structures from the beam halo and occasional mis-steering. A series of irradiations have been conducted at the Saturne, France, accelerator in which specimens of steel, copper, NbTi, aluminum, and niobium were exposed to protons with energies from 400 to 2000 MeV. Gamma activation measurements were made for various times subsequent to the end of the beam. Absolute and relative activity levels have been achieved on which estimates of the exposure levels to maintenance personnel can be made. Particular attention was given to Nb because of its prominence in scenarios that call for superconducting rf-cavity linacs. For Nb the activation products for the various irradiations were determined and compared with code predictions.

SULFIDE CAPACITY OF FeO-BASED SLAGS:</B> R.G. Reddy, W. Zhao, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487<P>
Sulfide capacities of FeO-based silicate slags were calculated <I>a priori</I> using the Reddy-Blander model. Experiments were done using encapsulation method for several slag systems as a function of compositions and temperatures. The experimental results agree with the predicted data very well.

During the experimental studies on sulfide capacities of non-ferrous metallurgical slags it was found that the choice of the thermodynamic data base is important for calculating the sulfur potential in such measurement. It was also found that some of the earlier sulfide capacity measurements required recalculation. The available sulfide capacity for different slag systems were reviewed after recalculations. This analysis suggested high sulfur solubility 
 in halide melts which were confirmed by experiments reported in another paper. The reviewed data on sulfide capacities are presented together with calculations of sulfur partition achievable with different slags.

<P>
CaF2 additions are made to oxide based slags used for steel desulfurization to aid in sulfur removal. It is commonly held that CaF2 by itself does not possess sulfur removal capability but enhances fluidity of CaO based slags which helps desulfurization. Recently BaF2 additions to CaO and BaO based slags have been studied to improve their sulfide capacity. To better understand the sulfur removal mechanism, sulfur solubility measurements were carried out on CaCl2-CaF2 and BaCl2-BaF2 melts. Results showed that contrary to earlier expectation they have high sulfur solubility and higher than that for sodium silicate slags which are used for desulfurization. The conventional sulfide capacity definition based on exchange of oxygen and sulfur ions in slag used for defining desulfurization power of slags do not apply to such melts as there are no oxygen ions present and no oxygen ion transfer takes place.

ASPECTS OF SLAG OPTIMIZATION IN SMELTING OF Cu-Ni SULFIDE CONCENTRATES:</B> A.A. Hejja, R.H. Eric, School of Process and Materials Engineering, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Private Bag 3, WITS 2050, South Africa<P>
The first part of this study deals with the importance of surface tension of slags produced in the smelting of sulfide concentrates. Theoretically the method of determining the surface tension of slags was laid down by Boni and Derge. The values obtained experimentally for a series of main oxide components were grouped into a useful correlation incorporating experimental constants for the relevant oxides present in the slag, some of these giving the surface tension value for the particular slag. These estimated values were coupled with or incorporated into the slag viscosity plots to show the correlation between the two factors. This is also important from a refractory attack point of view in the furnace operation. In the second part an attempt is made toward the optimization of slag composition relevant both for electric and reverberatory smelting processes. Using the knowledge of the viscosity and electrical conductivity of the slags at the temperature of furnace operation, the mode of optimization is based on Besselt function correlations which utilize the trend of the mostly parabolic plots of viscosities and conductivities. The results obtained by this method agree well with the optimum slag compositions being used in established operations derived from years of practical experience for various slags used in the furnaces. However, due to extensive turbulence in suspension and gas injected bath smelting processes, the outlined methods cannot be used for these processes. Also great caution should be exercised in their application for three electrode circular furnaces with separate slag cleaning.

On blowing nickel matte in a converter without quarts, first the oxidation of metallic iron and a part of FeS occurs without evolving sulfur dioxide, the formed FeO dissolves in a sulfide smelt and form a homogeneous Oxysulphide smelt. On further increasing the FeO content, the Oxysulphide separates into 2 layers. Based on the laboratory investigation of FeO-(FeS+Feo) - (Ni3S2+Nio) ternary phase we have identified the separation region at 1250&#176;C. The boundaries of the separation region have the form of an arc and the composition of the separated Oxysulphide layers is defined by the canodes. In the nickel or copper-nickel matte - calcium oxidesilica slag system at 1250&#176;C three layers, namely sulfide, Oxysulphide, and slag may be formed. A high slag basicity due to the presence of CaO can serve to enhance the activity of FeO; a low nickel content in the matte corresponds to a high concentration of FeS therein; FeO from slag and FeS from the matte form a homogeneous FeO-FeS solution, i.e. an Oxysulphide layer. The investigation on the &quot;Camebakes&quot; apparatus and by the nuclear gamma-ray resonance spectroscopy method of the phase composition in a slowly cooled Oxysulphide layer has shown the presence of four phases. wustite, troilite, ferronickel grains, and calcium oxide-silica inclusions. Knowledge of regulaties in the oxysulphides formation makes it possible to use them in pyrometallurgy of nickel and cobalt or preventing their formation.

RELIABILITY OF FERROELECTRIC CERAMIC MULTILAYER DEVICES: </B> Z. Suo, X. Gong, Mechanical and Environmental Engineering Department, Materials Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106<P>
In a multilayer actuator, each internal electrode terminates an edge inside the active ceramic. Around the edge, the nonuniform electric field generates an incompatible strain field, which, in its turn, generates stresses and may cause the ceramic to crack, leading to device failure. The industry has been exploring alternative electrode configurations to alleviate the stress concentration. The effort has been empirical and benefited little from numerical simulations. An inherent difficulty is that the actuator ceramics have nonlinear electro-mechanical interactions, of which no unified mathematical description is now available. This talk describes the basic phenomena, and a crack nucleation model that includes essential features of this nonlinearity. The model shows that, everything else being fixed, a critical layer thickness exists, below which a multilayer actuator will not crack around its internal electrode edges.

NON-LINEAR FRACTURE PROCESSES IN LAMINATED METAL COMPOSITES:</B> Don Lesuer, Bob Riddle, Chol Syn, L-342, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA 94551<P>
Numerous fracture processes exist in layered materials. These processes, which include crack bridging, crack deflection, stress redistribution and local plane stress deformation, will, in general, increase the fracture toughness of layered materials over that observed for non-layered materials. However, their specific influence on toughness (namely their influence on initiation toughness, growth toughness and R-curve behavior) is a function of the specific fracture mechanism active during crack growth. Many of these mechanisms compete with one another. The active mechanism(s) are strongly dependent on the material properties of the component layers, laminate architecture (such as volume fraction of the component materials and layer thickness), and interface properties. This paper will discuss the various fracture mechanisms in laminated metal composites (LMCs) containing alternating layers of ductile and brittle materials. The layers between these component materials have sharp interfaces. Specific systems include LMCs of an aluminum matrix composite and a monolithic aluminum alloy as well as ultrahigh-carbon steel and brass. Simulations of crack growth in these materials have been done using finite element analysis to study the non-linear fracture processes involved. The influence of component material properties, interface properties and laminate architecture on these processes will be described.

Kupp, David P. Stinton, The Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831<P>
The mechanical behaviour of continuous fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites is affected by several factors, such as: the type and thickness of fiber/matrix interface, the fiber strength statistical distribution and degradation after processing, the fabric stacking sequence of the laminate etc. For a 2-D plain woven Nicalon fiber cloth reinforced silicon carbide (SiC) with a SiC interfacial coating, little attention has been paid to the stacking sequence effect. In this paper, the fabric stacking sequence effects on the stress-strain distribution in flexural laminate bars, and the elastic properties of the laminate are calculated. A theoretical calculation model is established based on a combination of the classical laminated plate theory and an undulation model depicting fiber continuity and undulation shape, which is first developed by Chou et al. A closed-form FORTRAN program is compiled. Different combination of fiber lamina orientation and their stacking sequence are studied.

In this work, the oxide structure on aluminum-alloy surface was modified by chemical and electrochemical processes to produce different pore sizes and morphology. Interfacial bonds were then formed from these porous oxides and the crack growth resistance of the interfaces measured in air and corrosive environments. Significant differences were found among interfaces with different oxide microstructures. Micromechanical models were developed to determine the interlocking resistance from porous oxides. Based on the model, the role of interfacial interlocking in interfacial crack growth is discussed.

Fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are being developed for a variety of high temperature components for gas turbine engines. Many of these components are complex in shape and will be subjected to local stress 
 concentration under normal service conditions. The presentation will focus on the effects of stress concentrating features such as sharp slits and circular holes on the tensile properties of CMCs. Modeling and experimental efforts aimed at improving our understanding of the relationship between the mechanisms of inelastic deformation and their effects on notched strength will be reviewed. Results on MAS/Nicalon and woven SiC/SiC systems indicate that the conditions for fracture in the regions around holes are stochastic in nature and depend on the volume under stress. An approach for implementing weakest link statistics for predicting notched properties will be outlined. Recent work has revealed that inelastic deformation is also attainable in all-oxide CMCs with strong interfaces and porous matrices. The notched properties of these materials will be presented and their behavior compared with that of systems with weak interfaces. Research sponsored by ARPA-URI, Grant N00014-92-J-1808.

Ductile fracture mechanisms in these alloys, of such importance to modern civilization, are set in the context of the main applications for which they are used. Thin-sheet applications encompass two main aspects: prevention of localized shear fracture in sheet-forming, promotion of reproducible shear fractures in the &quot;ripping&quot; of &quot;ring-pulls&quot; on beverage cans or in the stamping-out of milk-bottle tops from oil. Both aspects relate to the generation of through-thickness shear fractures. In thick-section applications, it is necessary to address local fracture mechanisms in the combination of steep strain-gradient and high hydrostatic tension ahead of a notch or pre-crack. The prime micro-mechanisms are microvoid coalescence and &quot;fast (in-plane) shear&quot; linkage resulting from a (plane-strain) localization of flow. Behaviour in steels and high-strength aluminum alloys is contrasted and recent findings on &quot;mixed-mode&quot; shear fracture criteria are discussed. Attention is drawn to a number of applications for which &quot;plane-stress&quot; and &quot;plain-strain&quot; methodologies must be combined.

MODELLING LARGE DEFORMATION AND FAILURE IN MANUFACTURING PROCESSES USING INTERNAL STATE VARIABLES:</B> <I>Doug Bammann</I>, Mechanics and Simulation of Manufacturing Processes Department, Mail Stop 9405, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA 94551<P>
A state variable model for describing the fine-deformation behavior of metals is described. A multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into elastic, volumetric plastic (damage), and deviatoric plastic parts is considered. With respect to the natural or stress-free configuration defined by this decomposition, the thermodynamics of the state variable theory is investigated. This model incorporates strain rate and temperature sensitivity, as well as damage, through a yield surface approach in which the state variables follow a hardening minus-recovery format. The microstructural underpinnings of the model are presented along with a detailed description of the effects which each model parameter has on the predicted response. Issues associated with the implementation of this model into finite element codes are also discussed. A range of problems involving damage at various loading rates are presented including hydroforming, prediction of forming limit diagrams from limiting dome height studies and cracking during welding processes. In each case, experiments are well described by predictions based on this model.

The effect of pressure on the room temperature formability of 6111 T4 aluminum and &szlig; 21 S titanium sheets was evaluated in stretching, drawing, as well as plane strain. The sheet formability tests were performed using the patented Carnegie Mellon hot triaxial deformation system in conjunction with a specially developed 2 in diameter hemispherical punch and forming fixture. The strain state was varied by using different sample widths and lubrication conditions. Tests were conducted at ambient pressure and constant pressures of up to 70 MPa (10 ksi). Increasing all pressures used in forming increased the formability of the al sheets along all forming paths. The largest pressure-formability increase in the Al sheets occurred in plane strain. Biaxial stretching tests on the &szlig; 21 S sheets revealed that the formability actually <I>decreased</I> under a pressure of 10 ksi compared to the formability at ambient pressure. This pressure-induced formability decrease was accompanied by a change in fracture path and its mechanism is currently being investigated.

MICROSTRUCTURAL EFFECTS ON CAVITATION AND FRACTURE IN SUPERPLASTIC METALS: </B> <I>Amit K. Ghosh</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109<P>
Cavitation leads to flow localization and fracture during superplastic forming process. In this paper, several approaches on the micromechanical aspects of cavitation are critically examined. With plasticity effects present, constrained diffusional and plasticity-induced growth of cavities have been proposed in the dislocation creep regime. In the superplastic regime, however, cavitation behavior is considerably complicated by the predominance of grain boundary sliding and grain rotation effects. Consequently the amount of grain boundary sliding strain has a major effect on the degree of cavitation through cavity initiation, growth and coalescence. Dynamics of cavitation and its effect on strain localization leading to fracture has been examined. Also detailed quantitative aspects of cavity initiation on cavity growth have been carefully documented to separate the phenomenon of continuous nucleation of new voids from the cavity growth process. It appears that dynamic grain growth which influences grain boundary sliding in a major way, also influences cavitation. Thus flow localization and fracture are critically affected by microstructural evolution effects such as dynamic recrystallization and dynamic grain growth. Illustrative examples will be given from various metallic system.

MECHANISMS OF DUCTILE FRACTURE IN CRACK-TIP FRACTURE PROCESS ZONES:</B> <I>Peter F. Thomason</I>*, Department of Metallurgy and Materials Science, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3QZ; *on leave from University of Salford<P>
The strength and toughness of engineering alloys, under conditions where general yielding and subcritical crack growth precede catastrophic fracture, are critically depend on nucleation, growth and coalescence of microvoids in fracture process zones that are generally subject to high mean-normal stresses. It is shown that, at these high mean-normal stress levels, microvoid nucleation and coalescence can become the controlling process of ductile fracture in crack-tip plastic zones, with negligible dilatational void-growth prior to microvoid coalescence on the fracture surface. This effect is direct result of high mean-normal stresses promoting the microvoid coalescence process when the microvoids are still relatively small and widely spaced; thus virtually all dilational void-growth is confined to the final void-coalescence fracture surface, and the result of plastic limit-load failure (or internal microscopic necking) between adjacent microvoid nuclei.

The utilization of controlled rolling and quenching from the finish roll allows the design of composite microstructures, whereby the advantages of the second phase are optimized while the less desirable features of this phase are simultaneously mitigated by the presence of the other constituent phase. The size, morphology, distribution, shape and volume fracture of the second phase critically control the mechanical properties, especially fracture and fatigue of the dual phase systems. As a consequence, these structures offer a degree of metallurgical flexibility that is absent in single phase structures or in many precipitation strengthened systems, for attaining optimum sets of mechanical properties. Examples are presented here of martensite/austenite (~2 - 5%) mixtures designed for optimum combinations of high strength, toughness, and wear properties in medium carbon steels, e.g., for mining and agricultural applications; low carbon martensite/ferrite (~80%) structures for high strength, cold formability, improved low temperature ductility, and attractive improved corrosion resistance in concrete. In all cases these steels can be produced on line in a hot mill by controlled rolling and direct quenching.

EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF THE CAVITATION AND FAILURE BEHAVIOR OF A SUPERPLASTICALLY DEFORMED NEAR-GAMMA TITANIUM ALUMINIDE ALLOY: </B> Carl M. Lombard, Perikles D. Nicolaou, <I>Amit K.

The uniaxial hot tension behavior of a near-gamma titanium aluminide alloy sheet (Ti-45.5Al-2Cr-2Nb) was determined in the as-rolled condition (initial grain size ~3 to 5 &#181;m) and a rolled-and-heat treated (1177&#176;C/4 hours) condition (initial grain size ~10 to 12 &#181;m). Microstructure evolution, cavitation rates, and failure modes were established via constant strain rate tests at 10-4 to 10-2 sec-1 and test temperatures between 900 and 1200&#176;C. For both initial microstructural conditions, the failure mode was established as predominantly cavitation/fracture controlled. Cavity growth rates was greatest at lower temperatures and in the heat treated specimens; the higher cavitation rates in the heat treated specimens led to elongations only approximately one-half those of the as-rolled material. Experimental results were then compared with a 'force equilibrium approach' theoretical analysis of the isothermal hot tension test under cavitating conditions. Model results delineated the competition between failure controlled by localized necking versus fracture, the latter being defined by a critical volume fraction of cavities. The validity of the modeling approach was confirmed through the analysis of the experimental results and data from the literature.

THE EFFECT OF HYDROSTATIC AND SHEAR STRESSES ON THE HOT WORKING BEHAVIOR OF BULK METALS:</B> <I>Henry Piehler</I>, Consortium for the Advancement of Deformation Processing Research, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Wean Hall 2323, Pittsburgh, PA 15213<P>
The effect of pressure on the hot workability of a Ti-49.5Al-2.5Nb-1.1Mn (a/o) titanium aluminide was evaluated using both isothermal compression and isothermal hydrostatic upsetting tests. Tests were conducted at 1050&#176;C to strains of the order of one with and without pressure of 260 MPa to evaluate the effect of pressure on flow stress response, fracture retardation, and hot worked microstructure. The samples deformed without pressure exhibited noticeable cracks on the bulged free surface as well as internal deformation-induced voids; the superimposition of pressure suppressed both these types of deformation damage. Pressure was observed to have a neglible effect on the flow stress response, which could be adequately described by the von Mises criterion in all cases. Similarly, pressure had a negligible effect on dynamic recrystallization and microstructure under the conditions investigated. Preliminary results on pore closure in Osprey processed IN 718 subsequently deformed by isothermal hydrostatic upsetting are also presented.

THE EFFECT OF MATERIALS PROCESSING ON FRACTURE OF METALS:</B> <I>Clyde L. Briant</I>, Division of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912<P>
Thermomechanical processing of metals is often used to improve the fracture properties of materials. When materials are processed at room temperature, one can often achieve good control over resulting properties because one can avoid dynamic recovery and recrystallization. However, when processing is carried out at elevated temperature, dynamic changes can occur and make control difficult. In this paper we report on work in which refractory metals were processed at elevated temperatures try to achieve optimum fracture strength as measured in four point bending. The results will show that there is an optimum processing range to achieve fracture resistance. If the material is processed at too low a temperature internal cracks that occurred during processing will cause failures. If the processing temperature is too high, recrystallization occurs and the material will fail by low energy brittle fracture.

THE INFLUENCE OF INCLUSIONS ON THE FRACTURE TOUGHNESS OF AerMet 100:</B> <I>J.W. Morris, Jr.</I>, J. Chan and K. Sato, Department of Materials Science and Mineral Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA 97420-1760 and, Center for Advanced Materials, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720<P>
AerMet 100 is an ultra-high strength alloy recently that was recently commercialized by Carpenter Technology. The alloy is a secondary hardening, Fe-Ni-Co-Cr-Mo alloy that is age-hardenable to yield strength above 250 ksi, and fractures in a ductile mode at ambient temperature even after hardening to peak strength. The alloy is currently under investigation for potential use in aircraft landing gear. As expected from its ductile fracture mode, the fracture toughness of AirMet 100 is strongly dependent on the density of inclusions with sizes greater than about 2 &#181;m. As the inclusion spacing increases from ~0.2 to ~0.8 mm, the fracture toughness rises by roughly 70%, from ~110 ksiin. Metallurgical analysis shows that the large inclusions in these alloys are primarily rare earth (La, Ce, Nd) oxysulfides. The rare earth elements are present in the low concentration in the alloy, and, presumably, represent intentional additions to getter metalloid impurities such as sulfur. Research has shown that substantial improvements in toughness can be obtained by filtration before solidification. The toughness of AerMet 100 can be further improved by modifying, the alloy heat treatment the alloy heat treatment to alter the distribution of hardening precipitates. A brief pre-age at 510&#176;C prior to the standard aging at 485&#176;C significantly increases the fracture toughness, particularly in the case of the low-toughness sample.

The stereo-section fractography (SSF) technique has been employed to study the relationship of surface microfractographic features and internal microstructures. In this way, a direct correspondence is established between various fracture modes and microstructural details beneath the fracture surface of fracture toughness and fatigue specimens of an () Ti6Al4V alloy. The measurements show a one to one relation between surface and internal features. It was found that ductile holes formed along grain boundaries and also, cleavage facets cut through grains. It was evident that the microscopic texture formed in the solidification process affects the fracture mechanisms and hence, the fracture toughness of the alloy. Thus, the SSF technique is demonstrated as a very useful tool for the study of fracture behavior of materials.

The North American automotive industry is now a major user of P/M products. In the last sixteen years the weight of P/M parts in a family vehicle has increased from 7.7 to 13.7 kg. and this trend is expected to continue. The results of a recent Delphi Study predict substantial growth over the next decade in power train applications (camshaft lobes, conrods, bearing caps, transmission gears, valve seat inserts, and valve guidelines). In this presentation, three P/M automotive case studies are examined in terms of the technical and economical factors that resulted in commercial viability: (i) the pressed and sintered main bearing cap, (ii) the warm formed turbine hub, and (iii) the powder forged connecting rod. Potential new P/M automotive applications are also discussed.

PRESSURE CYCLING ENHANCED DENSIFICATION IN SEVERAL COMPOSITE COMPACT SYSTEMS:</B> <I>Ching-Yao Huang, </I>G.S. Daehn, Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210<P>
Recently, it has been observed that pressure cycling can significantly enhance densification of composite powder compacts in the constrained uniaxial consolidation. The simple explanation for this is that differential compressibility in the constituents of composites drives plasticity in the deformable phrase and the net compressive stress biases the resulting strain to fill porosity in compacts. In the present paper, several composites powder systems including Pb, Zn, Al matrices and Al2O3p, TiO2p, SiCw, reinforcements have been studied in room temperature consolidation in static and cyclic loading. Effects of pressure cycle maximum stress, amplitude, and period on the densification of composite powder compacts are observed and analyzed in terms of matrix strength as well as reinforcement properties including size, shape, and agglomeration. Some simple ideas are able to explain the observed results.

HIGH-NITROGEN AUSTENITIC STAINLESS STEEL POWDERS PORDUCED BY GAS ATOMIZATION:</B> G.O. Rhodes, W.B. Eisen, Crucible Research Center, 6003 Campbells Run Rd., Pittsburgh, PA 15205<P>
Nitrogen is increasingly being utilized as an interstitial alloying element in stainless steels due to the intrinsic benefits imparted on the strength and corrosion resistance properties. Using an alloy design model, austenitic stainless steel powders consisting of about 6-12% manganese, 22% nickel, 25-28% chromium, 4-8% molybdenum and having 0.6 to 1.25% nitrogen have been produced using nitrogen gas atomization. The nitrogen contents attained are substantially higher than predicted at a temperature of 1600&#176;C and nitrogen partial pressure of 100kPa using current thermodynamic models. The powders are subsequently consolidated to full density by hot isostatic pressing (HIP), and in the solution annealed condition the materials exhibit tensile yield strengths of up to 700 MPa with good tensile ductility and excellent corrosion resistance. The development and evaluations of the new steel are described in comparison to other established super austenitic stainless steels and nickel base corrosion resistant alloys.

Aluminum powders approximately 100 nanometers in diameter, made by the process of electroexplosion of wire in argon, have stored surface and strain energy that is released at threshold temperatures well below the melting point. This energy release and accompanying temperature increase allows self sintering and bonding to occur at relatively low temperatures. We studied the self sintering of nanosize aluminum powders made by electroexplosion by heating cold compacted pellets to 450C, at which point they exothermed with the generation of light and sufficient heat to partially melt the pellets. Preliminary results are also reported for bonding conventional aluminum powders and sheets using the energy release and temperature increase from exotherming nanosize electroexploded aluminum powders.

A two-staged method has been developed for free form fabrication of nickel and iron based alloy parts directly from alloy powders without the need for tooling or machining. The method provides shape and property control equal or superior to investment castings in the same base alloys. A major advantage of the approach is the ability to utilize commercially available selective laser sintering systems with virtually no modification from their standard configurations as intended for plastic model generation direct from CAD data bases. We have demonstrated the feasibility of shape, dimension and property control for complex, low production volume rocket engine components and for tools and dies intended for higher volume commercial production applications in fully hard commercial steels and superalloys. A new finite element model has been developed specifically to aid in control of sinter densification without distortion or cracking.

This paper describes the background and progress of a research and development effort called Rapid Net Shape Forming. This effort involves the development and reduction to practice of a process, known as the MetalShell process, for manufacturing complex net shape powder metal components. The process involves the use of electroformed nickel to create a net shape HIP canister. One of the outstanding features of the process is that it can be used to make hollow parts with thin walls. Potential applications for this technology include titanium and beryllium components including fan blades, inlet guide vanes, nozzle hardware, prosthetic devices, and intermetallic and composite components. This effort uses recent advances in process modeling and in-process sensing technologies to reduce the lead time and number of iterations required to make a net shape component. This is turn will make components more cost effective. The areas being exploited include rapid prototyping from CAD files to generate patterns and molds, numerical simulation of the electroforming process to optimize shield design and uniformity of canister thickness, and numerical simulation of HIP consolidation to predict final component dimensions.

Plasma activated sintering (PAS) involves application of electric pulsing before the sintering cycle. A comparative study has been carried out on nanocrystalline alumina powders with <I>y</I> and <I>a</I> starting phases. The results obtained with and without electric pulsing clearly establish the enhanced sintering kinetics due to prior electric pulsing. These results are explained on the basis of dielectric properties of the powders. In addition the present results show that the powder with <I>a</I>-phase sinters better. High densities (&gt;98%) can be obtained in less than 10 minutes at 1573 K. The time and temperature are significantly lower as compared to the conventional sintering parameter of 1773 K and 3 h. The reason for slower sinterability of powder with <I>y</I>-phase is linked to formation of vermicular structuring during transformation to <I>a</I>-phase. Examples of obtaining sintered products with simple shape in one step using PAS would be shown.

There is hardly any area in materials science where the necessity to supplement the experimental information acquired in the laboratory by the results of computer experiments is felt as urgently than for liquid and amorphous materials. The classical example is the structure: whereas laboratory experiments describe a one-dimensional projection of the three-dimensional structure, the computer-simulation delivers the full set of the atomic coordinates. During the last years, a wide variety of computational tools have been developed. These techniques can essentially be classified in three groups: (a) <I>Ab initio local-density functional techniques</I> in the spirit of the Car-Parrinello method. While in this approach no further assumption beyond the reduction of the many-electron Hamiltonian to an effective one-electron form is required, the massive computational effort restricts the application to models with at most a few hundred inequivalent atomic sites. (b) A variety of <I>tight-binding (TB)</I> based techniques (ranging from TB molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) to tight-binding-bond approaches to many-atom forces) allow to treat larger systems, albeit at lower accuracy. (c) Classical MD and MC based on <I>effective interatomic pair and volume forces</I> derived via effective-medium approximations, pseudo-potential theory, TB-moment expansions...etc. In this talk I shall attempt to review the state-of-the-art of the computer-modeling of the structural, dynamic, electronic and magnetic properties of amorphous alloys.

A recently developed real-space approach for studying the electronic structure properties of materials which exhibit both chemical and topological disorders is presented, within the tight-binding framework. For a chemically random alloy, we show that the Coherent Potential Approximation (CPA) equations can be solved self-consistently in real-space with the same accuracy as is currently done in reciprocal space, in the case of homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems. Based on the orbital peeling technique, effective on-site and many-body interactions which build up the configurational part of the total energy are computed. With this energetics, Monte Carlo simulations based on the Kawasaki spin-exchange dynamics are performed to predict chemical short-range order in amorphous alloys. The relaxation of the lattice is performed with TB-molecular dynamics simulations, and the overall scheme can be reiterated to self-consistency. Advantages of this global scheme are discussed and application to Zr-Ni alloys are presented. Work performed under the auspices of the U. S.

Free volume model is examined systematically and quantitatively in a model binary liquid using molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that at the glass transition, the liquid-like cells undergo a percolation transition. However, further analysis shows that free volumes do not exhibit any cooperative behavior at the percolation threshold. The continuous change in thermodynamic and transport properties suggests that the glass transition is kinetic in nature. Implication of the percolating properties of the free volumes in transport properties of undercooled liquids will also be discussed.

TEMPERATURE AND CONCENTRATION DEPENDENCE OF GRAIN BOUNDARY-DIFFUSION OF 63Ni IN PURE AND BORON-DOPED Ni3Al:</B> <I>Stefan Frank</I>, J&ouml;rg R&uuml;sing and Christian Herzig, Institut f&uuml;r Metallforschung, Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nster, Germany, now: Hahn-Meitner-Institut, Berlin, Germany
<P>
Knowledge about the diffusion behaviour in the grain boundaries of pure and of boron-doped Ni3Al is of basic importance to improve our understanding of the boron-effect and the mechanical properties of polycrystalline Ni3Al. We report on a first study of grain boundary diffusion in pure and doped Ni-rich Ni3Al polycrystals. Diffusion penetration profiles were determined by a serial sectioning technique using a precision parallel grinding device. The low energy <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">-decays of the 63Ni tracer were detected by liquid scintillation counting. The high efficiency allowed to significantly increase the detectable concentration range of the measured profiles and provided the basis for investigating grain boundary self-diffusion in Ni3Al in a meaningful way. For comparison grain boundary self-diffusion in pure Ni was re-investigated in true type R-kinetic. It is known that the temperature dependence of the grain boundary diffusion parameter P=<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif">Dgb of 63Ni in pure Ni and in both Ni3Al materials is of the Arrhenius type. The absolute values of P follow the sequence P Ni&gt;P Ni3Al&gt;P Ni3Al+B. The remarkably higher activation enthalpy Qgb (Ni3Al) in comparison with Qgh (Ni) can be attributed to the grain boundary structure of the strongly ordered Ni3Al compound. Ni-diffusivity in the doped alloy is about 2-3 times lower than in pure Ni3Al. A prospective reason for the decreased diffusivity is the segregation of B and the thereby enhanced cosegregation of Ni in the grain boundaries. The strong segregation of boron leads to a certain blocking of diffusion paths of the Ni atoms. High angle grain boundary energies in pure and R-doped Ni3Al are derived from the diffusion data applying the Borisov et al.relation. The effect of stoichiometry on grain boundary self-diffusion in Ni3Al was investigated for compositions between 73 and 78 at% Ni. A V-shaped concentration dependence of P with a minimum at near 75 at% Ni was observed which becomes very distinct at lower temperatures. At e.g. 1066 K P increases by about one order of magnitude from stoichiometric to Ni-rich Ni3Al. This behaviour is related to the change in composition and state of order of grain boundaries in non stoichiometric Ni3Al.

CALCULATIONS OF DIFFUSION AND SEGREGATION IN Al-Cu GRAIN-BOUNDARIES:</B> <I>X.Y. Liu</I>, J.B. Adams, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 105 South Goodwin Avenue, Urbana, IL 61801; Wei Xu, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, University of California, Livermore, CA 94551<P>
We have studied the atomistic mechanisms of electromigration in Al-Cu, in specific, the diffusion of atoms and segregation of Cu atoms in the Al grain-boundaries with a newly developed EAM interatomic potential constructed by the Force-Matching Method. The potential parameters are fitted to available experimental data plus <I>ab initio</I> force database. The energetic and structural properties of Cu segregation and the effect in atomic diffusion path and activation barriers are studied. The grain-boundary calculations, in agreement with <I>ab initio</I> results, show that the Cu segregation is dominated by size effects in the Al-Cu system, i.e., Cu atoms segregate to sites which are locally compressed. In the case of a <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-sigma.gif"> 11 tilt boundary, this predicts that the Cu will segregate to sites away from the symmetric center of the boundary.

ATOMISTIC SIMULATION OF GRAIN BOUNDARY STRUCTURE AND DIFFUSION IN B2 NiAl:</B> <I> Yuri Mishin, </I>Diana Farkas, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Materials Science and Engineering Department, Blacksburg, VA 24061<P>

We modify the existing embedded-atom potentials for NiAl by fitting them to self-diffusion data for pure Ni and Al and to the triple-defect model for this compound. Using the modified potentials and molecular statics we calculate the structure, excess energy and cohesive energy of [001] tilt grain boundaries in NiAl. The calculations are performed for 25 orientations with $\Sigma$ values from 5 to 185. For each orientation the lowest-energy stoichiometric boundary structure is established. Low-$\Sigma$ orientations are associated with minima of the boundary energy and maxima of the cohesive energy. The boundary structures obtained are analyzed in terms of the structural unit model. For two lowest-energy boundaries, $\Sigma=5$ (210) and $\Sigma=13$ (230), we simulate tracer self-diffusion in the boundary core both parallel and normal to the tilt axis. We assume the vacancy mechanism and calculate the vacancy formation and migration energies in the boundary core. To calculate the boundary diffusion coefficients we use the technique proposed recently by one of us [Phil. Mag. A 72, 1589 (1995)]. This technique combines the matrix method with Monte Carlo simulations of individual vacancy-tracer encounters. The effective activation energy is calculated in a wide temperature range and compared with the spectrum of individual jump energies in the boundary. The results are discussed in terms of the grain boundary mass transport and its effect on high temperature properties of NiA.

THE IVANTSOV GROWTH EQUATION AND INTERFACIAL KINETICS:</B> <I>Zi-Kui Liu</I>, Y. Austin Chang, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, 1509 University Avenue, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706<P>
The growth equation of parabloid was first derived by Ivantsov1 and later modified by Trivedi2 to take into account the interfacial energy and finite interfacial mobility (interfacial kinetics). The modification was done by first considering the effects of the interfacial kinetics and the interfacial energy and curvature, and then solving the diffusion equations on the composition at the interface. Though the modification was necessary, the growth equation was much more complicated that the original Ivantsov equation. In a recent publication by us, the advantage of the modern development of computational thermodynamics was taken and the Ivantsov equation was then used directly with the actual composition after taking into account the interfacial energy and the finite interfacial mobility. It was pointed out by a reviewer that this approach was not self evident if it is identical to Trivedi's modification. In the present report, we will formulate a consistent framework to describe the phenomena.

MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF TiAl3 PRODUCT LAYERS IN AlCuSi/Ti AND AlCu/Ti REACTION COUPLES:</B> <I>C. Wauchope</I>, J.E. Sanchez, Jr., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; P.R. Besser, R. Alvis, Advanced Micro Devices, Sunnyvale, CA 94088<P>
Metallization interconnects in advanced integrated circuits are typically fabricated from Al alloy (500-1000nm)/Ti (20-50nm) multilayer thin films. The Ti provides several effects in the Al layer; improved reliability against electromigration-induced failure, reduced Al grain size, increased Al (111) fiber texture, and reduced Al thickness due to Ti+Al reaction to form TiAl3. The TiAl3 reaction occurs during thermal processing and device fabrication, and leads to increased line resistance as the Al thickness is reduced. We present detailed cross-section transmission electron microscopic analysis of TiAl3 layers formed in AlCuSi/Ti and AlCu/Ti reaction couples. Results show that the Al alloy/TiAl3 and TiAl3/Ti interfaces are &quot;clean&quot; and free of intermediate phase layers. In addition local energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses show Si partitioning in the TiAl3 region in AlCuSi/Ti samples. The TiAl3 grain size is roughly independent of Al alloy type, and depends primarily on total TiAl3 thickness. These results are described in terms of models which describe the effects of Cu and Si alloying additions on the TiAl3 formation kinetics, in particular to the Ti+Al reaction rate dependence on the Ti/AlCuSi thickness ratio.

STRUCTURE, COMPOSITION AND THERMAL STABILITY OF METAL/CERAMIC INTERFACES:</B> <I>Manfred R&uuml;hle</I>, Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r Metallforschung, Seestr. 92, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany<P>
Metal/ceramic interfaces play a crucial role in different areas of materials science such as metallic interconnects in semiconductors, adhesion of oxide scales on metal substrates, thermal barrier coating, composites and bonding between bulk parts of metals and ceramics. It is of great interest to correlate the microstructure of those interfaces to their properties. The possibilities of getting information on the structure and composition of metal/ceramic interfaces will be discussed for several systems. The focus will be mainly on model systems (Cu/Al2O3, Ni/Al2O3, Nb/Al2O3) but also applications for real materials will be discussed. Segregation of impurities may lead either to an increase or decrease of the adhesion. Therefore, it is crucial to determine those impurities as accurately as possible. Metal/ceramic interfaces are often exposed to high temperatures at different atmospheres. Therefore, the thermal stability under service conditions is of great interest. The paper will describe recent advances and possibilities of determining the structure, composition and chemical reactions at those interfaces by conventional transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and analytical electron microscopy. The results of experimental studies will be compared to results of <I>ab-initio</I> first principles calculations and to experimental studies on the adhesion of metal films on ceramic substrates.

THE Al/Ni AND Al/Cu INTERFACIAL REACTIONS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ELECTRIC CURRENT:</B> Wen-Chyuarn Liu, <I>Sinn-wen Chen</I>, Department of Chemical Engineering, National Tsing-Hua University, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan 30043, China<P>
Electromigration has been observed and quite extensively investigated in the integrated circuit devices with the electric current density higher than 105 A/cm2. The electric current density in the electronic packaging was usually lower and the effect of electromigration has not been discussed. This study investigated the effect of weaker electric current, up to 103 A/cm2, upon the chemically-driven interfacial reactions in the Al/Ni and Al/Cu systems by analyzing their reaction couples. The reaction couples would be heated by the passing-through electric current. The temperatures of the reaction couples increased with the increasing electric density. Annealed at the same temperatures, similar results were found for the reaction couples with and without the passing-through electric current. Same intermetallics, such as Al3Ni and Al3Ni2, were formed at the interfaces, and the thickness of the reaction layers was the same. It was concluded that the electric current density up to 103 A/cm2 has little effect upon the interfacial reactions in the Al/Ni and Al/Cu systems.

THERMODYNAMICS OF VACUUMTHERMIC REDUCTION OF LIGHTWEIGHT MAGNESIUM-LITHIUM ALLOY:</B> <I> Dajian Wang,</I> Department of Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan 650093, China<P>
The principles of preparation of light weight alloy of Mg-Li alloy with a low-density less than 1g/Cm3 with vacuumthermic reduction are described according to the preliminary laboratory-scale results. The process involves the use of ferrosilicon and aluminium to reduce magnesia and lithium oxide concurrently in a vacuum furnace to mixing gas of metallic magnesium and lithium due to the higher pressures for both magnesium and lithium. The metallic vapours are cooled at the lower temperature part of the furnace. Thermodynamic analysis of related reactions and their equilibrium constants revealed the probabilities of reactions and preferable reductants of ferrosilicon or aluminium. The alloying effects at low pressure of reduced magnesium and lithium and their evaporation may significantly dominate the progress of the process. Based on the calculation determination of activity coefficients of components in Mg-Li binary, the thermodynamic aspects for both reduction process and vaporisation process are systematically analysed in the paper.

STRESS RELIEVING METHODS FOR THICK ALUMINIUM ALLOY PLATE: EVALUATION BY X-RAY DIFFRACTION RESIDUAL STRESS MEASUREMENT:</B> <I>Bernt Jaensson,</I> CSM Materialteknik AB, Box 13200, S-58013 Link&ouml;ping, Sweden; <I>Alfred Heinz</I>, Hoogovens Aluminium Walzprodukte GmbH, Postbox 920, D-56009 Koblenz<P>

In the design of metallic structural parts for aircraft there are, basically, two approaches that can be taken: either the part is built up from a number of individually formed elements which are joined by riveting or adhesive bonding, or the part is sculptured from a single forging or piece of plate. In this situation, designers of small aircraft tend to use the first approach, while integrally machine parts are dominant in the structure of large aircraft. However, the balance between the two options is also changing with time, in that present-day aircraft engineers are increasingly favouring the sculpturing method. Contributing to this trend is the availability of numerically controlled high-speed milling machines, as well as forgings and plate with low levels of residual stress. The choice between a hand forging/die forging or plate is often dictated by the height of the final part. Since plate can be more efficiently stress relieved - by stretching - it is the preferred choice whenever the thickest available plate can accommodate the part. In the last couple of years, plate producers have strived to raise the upper limit of the thickness range from, say, 150 mm to 250 - 300 mm. In so doing, might exceed the capacity of existing stretching presses, which necessitates the use of an alternative stress-relieving method e.g. stepwise cold compression. With respect to the resulting residual stress level, one could ask the question to which extent the relative advantage of plate over forging is preserved in this case. An earlier investigation of the relationship between stress-relieving of die forgings, residual stresses and distortion during machining is recapitulated to give a background to the present work, which involves measurement of through-thickness stress variations in 100 and 150 mm thick plate, stress relieved by stretching, and in cold compressed plate of 200 mm thickness.

TEXTURE CONTROL OF ALUMINUM ALLOY SHEETS: </B> C.-H. Choi, K.-H. Kim, D.N. Lee, School of Materials Science and Engineering and Center for Advanced Materials Research, Seoul National University, Shinrimdong, Kwanak-ku, Seoul 151-742, Korea<P>
In order to achieve good deep drawability it is imperative to obtain well developed {111}texture which gives rise to the higher plastic strain ratio. It is difficult to obtain the texture from conventional rolling and annealing processes. Therefore an unconventional rolling process which causes shear deformation has been introduced in addition to the conventional rolling process. Various combinations of the conventional and unconventional rolling processes and the annealing process have been theoretically and experimentally studied to obtain the well developed {111}texture which in turn gave rise to a substantial<B> </B> increase in the plastic strain ratio.

The Al-M-Mm (Mm=misch metal) alloys have been produced by a gas atomization, a sing roll melt spinning and a twin roll spinning methods. These alloys have amorphous structure, finely mixed structure consisting of aluminium phase, intermetallic compounds homogeneously embedded in the ultrafine &quot;rained aluminium matrix and intermetallic compounds in the large &quot;rained aluminium matrix depending on the process variables. The alloy powders and ribbons have been warm compacted to various relative densities at various temperatures. The cylindrical and ring shapes compacts have been upsetted at various temperatures and the plastic deformation behaviours have been investigated using TEM, DSC and XRD. The density distribution, load, deformed geometry, friction coefficient, interparticle bonding behavior have been compared with the theoretically calculated ones.

NUMERICAL ANALYSIS OF MICROSEGREGATION IN AL ALLOY WELD METALS:</B> C.H. Lee, E.P. Yoon; RASOM, Dept. of Met. Eng., The Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, 133-791<P>

During solidification of alloys under rapid thermal excursion of welds, the solute redistribution brings out microsegregation. The microsegregation causes the formation of non-equilibrium second phases, shrinkage and porosity degrading properties and forming solidification crack. Therefore, it has been required to predict microsegregation quantitatively. To predict the degree of microsegregation, more exact and appropriate computer simulation technique has been being actively used during last two decades. In this study, an advanced two dimensional model was suggested on the basis of the previous one and two dimensional models. In the new model, both primary and secondary arm regions were defined for the analysis region. Before calculation of microsegregation, the analysis region was determined by the theoretical equation for the primary and secondary arm spacing. The growth in the primary arm region was assumed to be a planar for effective calculation. Especially, for the growth of a secondary arm, a simple and effective mathematical function was established to show the growing pattern(polynomial interface). The solute diffusion in the solid phase was calculated by finite difference method (FDM). The solid-liquid interface movement was considered to be in local equilibrium state indicated by the phase diagram.

The addition of Mn to the tetragonal Al3(Ti1-xZrx) phase produced cubic Ll2-type Al66Mn9(TiZr)25 phase with a small amount of second phases such as Al8Mn5 and Al2Zr, still existing in the as-cast state. Second phases disappeared when intermetallic compounds were homogenized at 1000&#176;C for 24 hours. After homogenization, intermetallic compounds were mixed with pure A1 in the form of powder by attritor mill and then vacuum hot pressed. IDS (intermetallic-dispersion-strengthened) Al alloys prepared in this way were analyzed in terms of phase stabilities and microstructures through XRD, SEM and TEM methods.

SOLIDIFICATION PROCESSING FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FINE GRAIN ALUMINUM ALLOY MATERIALS</B>: Akira Sato, Garo Aragane, Yoshiaki Osawa, and Susumu Takamori; National Research Institute Far Metals, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 306 Japan<P>
It is well-known that metallic materials having fine grain crystal structures possess high mechanical properties, ie., high strength and at the same time high toughness. A new process named &quot;Rapid solidification with vigomus agitation&quot; is developed to produce large ingots having fine grain and homogeneous structures. The molten alloys are rapidly solidified with watercooled copper molds and at the same time stirred vigorously by graphite rods during falling down of the melt through the gap between the mold and the rod. The results obtained using Al-Si alloys are as follows. The mean grain size of primary crystals in slurry become smaller with increasing the intensity of cooling and the rotation speed of stirring rod. Primary and eutectic Si grains are not only small but also globular when the agitation is strong enough.

<P>
Electrodeposited metal matrix/metal particle composite coatings (EMMC's) were deposited, heat treated, and characterized. Nickel matrix/aluminum particulate coatings deposited on a nickel substrate was chosen as a model system. The microstructure of the as-plated and heat treated coatings was characterized using light optical microscopy (LOOM), SEM, quantitative image analysis (QIA), and EPMA. A schematic model is presented for coating morphological development during codeposition of small, electrically conducting particles. The heat treated coatings consist of a two phase mixture of y solid solution and Ni3Al (gamma-prime) with small Kirkendall voids also present. The hardness of the heat treated coatings increased with increasing Ni3Al content and remained constant with extended heat treatment time. Oxidation tests were performed isothermally in air at 800, 900, and 1000&#176;C for up to 900 hrs. and the depth of the oxidation attack was determined. Throughout the investigation, the Ni-Al coatings were compared to conventional pure Ni coatings deposited under similar conditions.

FORMATION OF THIN COLORED FILM ON STAINLESS STEEL:</B> <I>G.S.Gupta</I>, Dept. of Mining, Minerals and Materials Engineering, The University of Queensland, St.Lucia, Queensland - 4072, Australia
<P>
Formation of colored film on type 304 stainless steel has been studied using chromic acid and potassium dichromate solutions. Permanent colors have been obtained using immersion and electrolytic (potentiostatic) methods. The effect of different parameters on the coloring process including temperature, coloring methods, solution composition, stirring, surfactant etc., have been noted. Moderate temperature of the solution, electrolytic method, use of surfactant and stirring of the solution were found to enhance the coloring process. A coloring solution which is strongly oxidized and acidic in nature is recommended. It is advisable that after the extended use of the coloring solution, fresh solution should be used.

TRICATIONIC PHOSPHATE COATING ON GALVANNEALED STEEL SHEET:</B><I> Carlos Nelson Elias, </I>Mila Marques Justo, Escola de Engenharia Metaurgica de Volta Redonda, Av dos Trabalhadores 420, 27260 740 Volta Redonda, RJ - Brazil
<P>
The galvannealed compared to galvanized steel sheet has excellent paint adhesion, weldability and corrosion resistance after painting. However, the coating tends to cause exfoliation when undergoing severe deformation. This coating is used in the automobile industry. Since the mass loss is very large, it accumulates on the metal mold and results in severe damage to the surface quality of the formed panel affecting press workability and damaging the tool. Nevertheless, phosphating is the most widely used pretreatment, since it serves as an excellent paint base, increases corrosion resistance to metal paints, aids in cold forming of steel and increases the lubricant power of oil applied to the pieces subjected to friction and wear. The influence of galvannealed morphology on the phosphate crystal feature is not well understood. In this work, a tricationic phosphate coating was applied to a surface of a low carbon steel and an interstitial free steel with galvannealed coating. Our paper will discuss the structural and mechanical properties resulting from this treatment.

PROGRESS TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF DENDRIMER-BASED PROTECTIVE COATING:</B> <I>Larry A. Milco, </I>Donald A Tomalia, Michigan Molecular Institute, 1910 W. St. Andrews Road, Midland, MI 48640-2696
<P>
There is a considerable demand for thin film coatings to which other substances will not stick. Coatings are required to protect surfaces from soils, stains, ice, graffiti, insects, oils, corrosion and chemical and biological contaminants. Moreover, as legislative pressures to remove volatile organic solvents from coating formulations persist, the demand for alternative water-borne systems continues to increase. The incorporation of dendritic polymers in non-stick coating formulation is a highly viable approach to overcoming the limitations associated with conventional polymer systems. Non-stick coatings were prepared by crosslinking dendrimers with linear polymers. The high advancing and receding contact angles and low contact angle hysteresis of water and hexadecane on the coatings are indicative of the non-stick (low adhesion) properties of these surfaces.

PULSED LASER DEPOSITION OF COLLAGEN AND APATITE/COLLAGEN COMPOSITE BIOCOMPATIBLE THIN FILMS:</B> J.A. Conklin,<I> C.M. Cotell</I>, Surface Modification Branch, Code 6671, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. 20375
<P>
Thin films comprising either collagen or a composite of hydroxyapatite (HA) and collagen were deposited by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on various substrates. Films were deposited using either a KrF (248nm) or ArF (193nm) excimer laser and the substrates were maintained at room temperature. Collagen films were characterized by SEM, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis. The functional groups on the collagen molecule remained intact through the laser ablation process, but there was evidence for some loss of secondary structure. In addition, the surface morphology was a function of the laser fluence and the gas environment during PLD. Less denaturation of the molecule was observed when the ablation was at 193nm than at 248nm. For the composite films, the target material consisted of a 70/30 (by weight) mixture of apatite/collagen, the same ratio found in bone. The resulting composite films were a homogenous mixture of amorphous collagen and highly crystalline apatite.

PROTEINS FROM OYSTER SHELL AS MODELS FOR BIODEGRADABLE COMMERCIAL POLYMERS:</B> <I>A.P. Wheeler</I>, Department of Biological Sciences, Clemson University, Clemson, SC 29634
<P>
Virtually all minerals formed by organisms are composites, containing an organic phase (matrix) which enhances the mechanical properties of the inorganic phase and which presumably controls mineral growth. The matrix of the CaCO3 shell of oysters contains soluble, highly anionic proteins which in vitro adsorb to mineral and in so doing alter mineral growth. Based on the surface reactive properties of these proteins, synthetic analogs have been made which have properties that make them candidates as inhibitors for mineral scale and corrosion and as dispersants. Synthesis of a simple matrix protein analog, polyaspartic acid, is possible on a significant scale using dry thermal polymerization and aspartic acid as the only reactant. Thermal polyaspartic acid is highly biodegradable when compared to polymers currently used for commercial surface reactive applications.

THE APPLICATION AND SUBSEQUENT CROSS-LINKING OF A BIOLOGICAL POLYMER ON ALUMINUM METAL:</B> <I>Douglas C. Hansen</I>, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. 20375-5343
<P>
Biological polymers that are used by organisms in the formation of structural materials and protective coatings are widespread in nature. An example of such a polymer is the protein utilized by the blue mussel Mytilus edulis as a varnish coating on its byssal threads. This protein is of high molecular weight (&gt;100,000) and is unique in containing the catecholic amino acid L-dopa. This protein exhibits high affinity for metals and acts as a substrate for the enzyme catechol oxidase, which catalyzes the two electron oxidation of catechol to o-quinone. This reaction is essential in the formation of a two component sclerotized resin. The adsorption of this protein onto pure aluminum (99.99999%) and subsequent cross-linking of the adsorbed protein results in a significant shift in the critical pitting potential and polarization resistance of the treated aluminum. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements clearly show that treatment of the protein adsorbed onto Highly Ordered Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG) with catechol oxidase results in a stable, varnish-like coating.

<P>
The adsorption of Mussel Adhesive Protein (MAP) from the marine mussel <I>Mytilus edulis</I> has been investigated on polystyrene (PS) and poly (octadecyl methacrylate) (POMA) surfaces using angle dependent XPS and AFM. XPS analysis was performed at LN temperatures without dehydrating the samples and at room temperature following dehydration. The analyses indicate that adsorbed MAP is stabilized on the surface of the PS through specific interactions preventing the protein from losing lateral spatial distribution across the surface upon dehydration. The adsorbed MAP on the POMA surface is representative of a loosely bound protein layer that is adsorbed through non-specific types of interactions allowing the protein to lose much of its lateral distribution when dehydrated. These data demonstrate that the surface chemistry of the polymer films influences protein-protein and protein-surface interactions, and that hydration plays a significant role in structuring protein-surface interactions.

<P>
Aluminum - fly ash composite was prepared by pressure infiltration technique. Loosely packed beds of cenosphere fly ash (above 55 vol% in the composite) can be successfully infiltrated by molten aluminum under pressure in the range of 0.3-0.7 MPa, and the density of the composite is 1.4 g /cm3 compared to the density 2.68g/cm3 for aluminum. Cenosphere fly ash particles are very light materials (density: 0.4 - 0.6 g/cm3). The microstructure of composite showed that there was uniform distribution of fly ash particles in the aluminum matrix. The mechanism of pressure infiltration and the reaction between aluminum and fly ash during infiltration and solidification will be discussed. Selected properties including hardness, microhardness, and compressive strength of aluminum - fly ash composites were determined and the results are presented in this paper.

Graphite is a very attractive candidate for aluminum MMC's. However, aluminum does not wet graphite. Thus the production of aluminum-graphite composite is difficult. Nickel is a material known to be wetted by aluminum. INCO Limited recently has developed a novel technique for coating graphite fibres with nickel. It was found that such coating promotes aluminum wetting on the fibres. To determine the wettability of aluminum on nickel coated graphite, the sessile drop technique along with a high temperature x-ray setup was used. Samples of graphite, electrolytic nickel, and nickel coated graphite were examined. Contact angles determined for these samples showed that graphite is non-wetting while the nickel coated graphite provided better wetting than electrolytic nickel. The nickel-aluminum interface of the samples were examined microscopically using SEM.

IN SITU PROCESSING OF TiB2/Cu-ALLOY COMPOSITES BY REACTIVE PRESSURELESS INFILTRATION (RPI):</B> <I>V. Shtessel</I>, M. Koczak (deceased), Department of Materials Engineering; R. Mutharasan, Department of Chemical Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA 19104
<P>
The process of Reactive Pressureless Infiltration (RPI) for in situ synthesis of Cu-Mn/TiB2 composites from elemental powders has been investigated. Primary factors, which alter phase composition and microstructure of the MMCs are enthalpy and relative free energy of reinforcement formation, initial powder size, processing temperatures and matrix wettability of the reinforcement. The Cu-Mn/TiB2 composite material was synthesized by matrix assisted displacement reactions, where the desired reinforcement forms gradually as a result of liquid infiltration and reaction. A weak boride former, e.g. Mn, is mixed with B in the bottom layer and infiltrated with Cu-Ti alloys. The process involves two consecutive steps: (1) formation of weak boride, e.g. Mn + 2B -&gt; MnB2; (2) displacement reactions, e.g. MnB2 + Ti-Cu -&gt; TiB2 + Cu-Mn. This route is advantageous due to improved wettability of Mn compounds by copper. Composites with 5, 7 10, 15, 20 and 30v/o of TiB2 have been produced and their microstructures and mechanical properties are being evaluated. Typical microstructures illustrate an even distribution of 0.5 - 5 micron particulates of TiB2. Possible mechanisms of the microstructure development during the process of reactive infiltration were analyzed. The study demonstrates that TiB2 forms by interfacial reaction: Ti + MnB2 = TiB2 + Mn. A kinetic model of the process has been proposed. The model enables us to determine the infiltration rate, the thickness of reacted layer as a function of time, the rate of reaction of TiB2 formation, the concentration profile of each component in the reactive layer. The model shows good agreement with experimental results. The RPI process is a promising technique for in situ, net-shape manufacturing of Cu-based MMCs. This research is supported by Office of Naval Research.

<P>
Ceramic composite systems based on all-oxide constituents are of interest for high temperature applications owing to their inherent oxidative stability but must also be designed to exhibit damage tolerance. One microstructural design concept relies on crack deflection through a porous matrix rather than at fiber/matrix interfaces, which is the more conventional approach to toughening in CMC's. The requisite matrix must have an optimum combination of toughness and strength which can be achieved by incorporating a minimum amount of fine, well distributed porosity, and must also be chemically and microstructurally stable at high temperatures. Composites based on this concept have been synthesized using vacuum infiltration of aqueous mullite-alumina slurries into woven polycrystalline alumina fiber preforms, followed by precursor impregnation and sintering. Initial evaluation of these materials shows promising behavior under tension and potential for notch insensitivity and thermal stress tolerance. Current understanding of the underlying mechanisms as well as microstructural design and processing issues relevant to the attainment of this behavior will be discussed.

<P>
In-Situ TiB2/TiN and TiB2/TiC CMCs were fabricated from fully dense BN-Ti and B4C-Ti powder blends with and without the addition of Ni powder. Three different methods were used: pressureless and pressure-assisted displacement reaction synthesis and thermal explosion under pressure. Application of a moderate external pressure (&#190; 200 MPa) was shown to be sufficient to ensure full density of TiB2/TiN/Ni and TiB2/TiC/Ni composites. The addition of Ni powder allowed to significantly reduce the ignition temperature of thermal explosion due to the formation of the low temperature Ti-Ni eutectic phase. Thus, the preheating temperature or thermal explosion, as well as the processing temperatures of displacement reaction synthesis (&#190; 1200&#176;C) were considerably lower than those typical of current methods used for the processing/consolidation of CMCs. Microstructure and composition of materials obtained were characterized by x-ray diffraction and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). Mechanical properties were evaluated by measuring microhardness, fracture toughness and three-point bending strength. High fracture toughness of TiB2/TiN/Ni and TiB2/TiC/Ni CMCs was obtained indicating that fine Ni dispersions are effective in dissipating the energy of propagating cracks.

<P>
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) or the so-called anionic clays are the analog of the extensively studied family of cationic smectite clay minerals. The successful treatment of Bayer lake waters requires the removal of anions, both inorganic and organic; thus, the utilization of these anionic clays are ideally suited for this process. Insitu crystallization of layered double hydroxides have resulted in the removal of anions from Bayer lake water at two different refineries. Data on the removal of anions and their selectivity for intercalation in the layered double hydroxide indicates that the order of removal is CO3, C2O4, SO4. The monovalent chloride ion is least preferred but also can be extracted at significant levels at the higher level of treatment. The total organic carbon (TOC) is also lowered significantly. Measurements on succinate and malonate, both diacids, show a significant reduction at the higher levels of treatment. Successful regeneration of hydrocalumite show the thermal products of mayenite and calcium oxide which can then be recrystallized in lake water with concomitant further reduction in anion content. Additional experiments using ultrasonic radiation show an enhanced carbonate removal through increased calcite formation.

The regeneration of the chemically bound caustic soda and alumina from red mud was studied in laboratory and pilot plant scale between 260 and 320&#176;C as a function of caustic soda concentration and final A/C ratio of the liquor, lime dosage and retention time. The pilot plant tests have been carried out in a tube digester facility of 3.0 m3/h designed by HUNGALU ALUTERV-FKI Ltd. and the test work was performed in cooperation with the team from the Alm&aacute;sfuzit&oacute; Alumina Refinery. At 260-320&#176;C iron-rich iron-aluminium-hydrogarnets (Ca-Al-Fe-hydrosilicates) were formed allowing 90-95% Na2O and 20-70% Al2O3 content of red mud to be recovered as a function of the final A/C ratio with a specific lime consumption of 2.5-3.0 kg CaO/kg regenerated NaOH. The tube digester was found as an adequate equipment. The viability of the process highly depends on the price ratio of the caustic soda and burnt lime. The latest development in red mud separation also increased the viability of the hydrothermal treatment of red mud.

The properties of high alumina ceramics are strongly influenced by the properties of the starting raw materials such as the grain size distribution and their morphology. Due to this, the grinding operation is an important step in the process of ceramic mass production. The investigations presented show that compared to other mills, the use of a rotary vibration mill will reduce time of grinding, the energy consumption and yield finer powders. The aim of these investigations was to obtain alumina powders with d50 approximately 3 um and d90 close to 10 um. Two different starting materials were tested. The process of grinding was performed according to various parameters such as filling ratio, amount of grinding media, alumina and water, ball set and frequency. The influence of ratios between the grinding media, alumina and water are shown. The influence of ball size, time and frequencies on the kinetics of grinding are shown. Finally the effect of alumina grinding on the physical properties such as green and fired density and shrinkage are shown and discussed in this paper.

Tests were carried out in the laboratory rotary-vibration mill with a low frequency of vibration below 16 Hz at two sets of work. In the first set, the mill chamber had both rotary and vibration movements, while in the second one, the mill chamber made only the vibration movement such as in the case of a classic vibration mill. Results show that it is possible to obtain a high purity alumina with low energy consumption in both sets.

Laboratory studies of colloidal alumina-bonded TiB2 have been carried out.

The barrier action to sodium is the ability to form a stable liquid aluminium layer in the pores of the coating which will slow down the reaction: Al(l)+3 NaF(in electrolyte)=3 Na(in C cathode)+ AlF3 (in electrolyte) as the sodium stabilizing C is no longer in close contact with the bath.

<P>
From principles of irreversible thermodynamics, a simple expression is developed for the driving force for transport of bath constituents across a non-isothermal matrix into the refractory lining in aluminium electrolysis furnaces. The expression shows that the transport outwards of aggressive substances is favoured by the temperature gradient. Possible applications are demonstrated for 3 penetrating gases with a variety of applied and proposed refractory materials. Common to all results is a possible reduction of the rate of penetration into barriers by a smaller temperature gradient due to the entropies of reaction. This can be accomplished by proper heat insulation below. A set of conclusions regarding the resistance of chemical barriers to penetration by bath components completes the paper.

The phase relations in the system sodium fluoride - mullite are relevant to chemical reactions that take place in fireclay based refractory materials used in the bottom lining of aluminium electrolysis cells. The solid-liquid phase relations have been investigated by means of differential thermal analysis, powder X-ray diffraction analysis and microscopy. At sub solidus temperatures the four compounds sodium fluoride, cryolite, nepheline and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">-alumina have been found at excess amount of sodium fluoride. At lower concentration of sodium fluoride, corundum is formed at the expense of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">-alumina. The solidus temperature was observed at 857&#177;5&#176;C which corresponds well with results in systems with higher aluminium fluoride content. An apparent eutectic was observed at 12&#177;0.5 mole% mullite. Nepheline and cryolite are the two main components of the melt crystallizing at the solidus temperature. The liquidus temperature at the solubility limit was observed at 943&#176;C and at 7.5&#177;0.5 mole% mullite.

PYROHYDROLYSIS OF SPENT POTLINING:</B> Vladimir Blinov, <I>Tor Grande</I>, Harald A. &Oslash;ye, Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway
<P>
Due to the toxic nature of spent potlining (SPL) this is becoming one of the major environmental concerns for the aluminium industry today. SPL also represents a major recovery potential because of its fluoride and energy content. The Elkem SPL recycling process is one of several technically feasible alternatives for treatment and recycling of SPL. In this process the fluorides can potentially be recovered by a pyrohydrolysis of the oxyfluoride silicate slag from the Elkem process. The thermodynamic aspects of this pyrohydrolysis are discussed in the present work. Chemical activity of fluorides in actual oxyfluoride silicate melts has been determined by means of high temperature mass spectroscopy and the Knudsen effusion method. Only sodium fluoride was observed as volatile species for dry melts. The chemical activity of sodium fluoride in several melts could therefore be determined by the Knudsen effusion method. Together with data on the activity of sodium oxide, the present activity data of sodium fluoride enable a calculation of the equilibrium pressure of HF during pyrohydrolysis of SPL.

The swelling pressure has the most significant effect on determining the cathode life among other loads applied on the steel casing of the aluminium reduction cell. In previous research, an identification technique is applied to determine the average swelling pressure value that is exerted on the side wall of the cell. The identification technique made use of the measured deformation of the cathode steel casing at different elapsed times (after 88 and 615 days) on an existing cathode that belongs to EgyptAlum. A new set of measurements has been conducted at different elapsed time (after 1055 days). This new set of measurements has been conducted at different elapsed times (after 1055 days). This new set of measurements gives a unique opportunity to reassess the identified swelling parameters. On the other hand, the distribution of the swelling pressure along the cathode interface with the vertical steel walls of the cell, has a significant effect on the performance of the steel casing. In this paper, the distribution of the swelling pressure, the interface of the carbon blocks and the steel casing, are identified. A nonlinear elasto-plastic model for the steel casing using combination of shell and beam elements is developed. The carbon blocks are modeled using solid and truss elements. The model utilizes Dewing model that describes the swelling pressure as a function of the elapsed time and confined swelling strain rate to determine the swelling pressure distribution. The swelling pressure is initiated using a predetermined free and confined swelling rate. As a nonlinear analysis progress with item, the confined swelling rate of the previous time step is used to assess the swelling pressure at the interface for the subsequent steps. The swelling pressure distribution is then determined at any elapsed time.

Cell disturbances such as anode effect and process operations such as feeding, anode changing and metal-tapping often cause variations in the heat balance of a reduction cell, resulting in deviations from the optimum operating conditions. A dynamic ledge heat transfer model built on an earlier one-dimensional dynamic simulation by the authors and based on the finite difference method was used to solve the transient heat conduction with phase change in the sidewall/ledge region. Fixed-grid and deforming-grid spacings were respectively superimposed on the sidewall and ledge region in order to track the moving front. Various aspects of the process dynamics with respect to the variation of ledge thickness and sidewall shell temperature were considered.

The most significant first step toward electronic prototyping (EP) in the research community has been the pursuit of intelligent processing (i.e., closed-loop process control), effectively using in situ sensors to monitor both process parameters (energy input), material behavior (changes in bulk structure, temperature, etc.), and characterize materials at the atomic scale, wherein material properties such as strength, residual stresses, composition, phase, compressibility, modulus, etc., are monitored and controlled in real-time. Of interest are the identity of interrelationships between sensed variables which enable fault detection - discover and monitor, in real-time, an evolving taxonomy (a set of linear and other meaningful relationships) which can be classified as &quot;faults&quot;; process stability analysis - establish a measure of stability, in real-time, by assessing process response/noise in the context of energy input, apparatus actuation, and the control algorithm requisite variety; and response time - establish a measure of performance, in real-time, of &quot;sensor-actuator&quot; limits to affect specific processing requirements. Yet these capabilities are merely near-term - the more interesting, longer term capability is the pursuit of process discovery, i.e., how these relationships and measures might provide insight into explaining phenomena of interest and/or enable the development of a material or process model in situ.

ACCURATE, RELIABLE CONTROL OF PROCESS GASES BY MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS:</B> <I>J. Hardy, </I>T. McKnight, Instruments and Controls Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6003
<P>
The thermal mass flow controller, or MFC, has become an instrument of choice for the monitoring and controlling of process gas flow throughout the materials processing industry. MFCs are used on CVD processes, etching tools, and furnaces and in the semiconductor industry are used on 70% of the processing tools. Reliability and accuracy are major concerns for the users of MFCs. Calibration and characterization technologies have been developed and implemented for mass flow devices. A test facility is available to industry and universities to test and develop gas flow sensors and controllers and evaluate their performance related to environmental effects, reliability, reproducibility, and accuracy. Additional work has been conducted in the area of accuracy. A gravimetric calibrator was invented that allows flow sensors to be calibrated in corrosive, reactive gases to an accuracy of 0.3% of reading. This paper will present possible sources of error in MFC process gas flow monitoring and control, and will present an overview of corrective measures which may be implemented with MFC use to significantly reduce these sources of error.

MONOLITHIC MICRO-SPECTROMETER FOR LOW-COST LIQUID AND GASEOUS CONSTITUENT PROCESS MONITORING:</B> <I>S. Rajic</I>, C.M. Egert, Engineering Technology Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-8039
<P>
A monolithic miniature spectrometer suitable for a variety of sensing applications including industrial process monitoring has been developed. The device consists of a solid structure with a volume less than 6 cubic centimeters. All optical components of the spectrometer including two aspheric mirrors, a diffration grating, and entrance and exit surfaces are fabricated onto the surface of the structure. All light paths are internally contained within the structure. The result is a small, rugged spectroscopic sensor ideally suited for use as a process monitor. Due to its monolithic nature, the device requires no post-fabrication alignment; nor can it be knocked out of alignment during use. The prototype device discussed here was produced in PMMA by precision diamond turning; however, lower cost manufacturing approaches involving injection molding (using diamond turned molds) are under development to produce an affordable sensor. Due to its rugged monolithic design, small footprint, and low cost, the monolithic micro-spectrometer is ideally suited for distributed process monitoring applications often required for industrial processes. It is expected that specific sensor designs will be required for specific applications so as to maximize the performance and resolution over the operating range. The performance of this device as well as the design tradeoffs necessary to optimize performance for given applications will be discussed in the report.

Manufacturing or embedding optical fiber sensors in composite materials such as graphite-epoxy, cementitious, plastic or ceramic components is of growing importance to a variety of smart materials and structures applications. A variety of fiber optic sensors can measure strain, pressure, and temperature by observing changes in an output signal fluorescence spectrum or a shift in output signal peak wavelength. The ability to measure these parameters on the surface of, as well as within, a part could provide experimental data for evaluating models, perhaps identifying some inferior parts on-line, and monitoring operating behavior. Some examples are monitoring cure and assessing thermal damage in polymer matrix composites by measuring changes in the epoxy fluorescence spectrum and monitoring densification during powder pressing. Other potential applications include engine diagnostics, condition based maintenance of aircraft and vehicle components, and monitoring and control in the metal forming and materials processing industries.

Physical models for acoustic emission (AE) are introduced and expressions are derived to predict AE activity from such parameters as applied stress, strain, and strain rate. These models are then incorporated into a visco-plastic finite-element simulation program, and the acoustic emission event rate generated during metal-forming operations are predicted. Simulation results are presented for upsetting operations on a typical C-Mn type steel for various friction and die geometry conditions. The AE model predictions compare well with the available experimental results reported in the literature and demonstrate that AE signatures can be reliably simulated. The signatures predicted for metal forging are fairly insensitive to changes in certain processing parameters. This suggests that AE event rate monitoring may not be well suited for monitoring changes in microstructure and friction during forging operations. Some very preliminary studies of event spectral analysis have been performed which show that AE spectral features may be sufficiently dependent on structure and loading to warrant further examination for application to monitoring metal-forging processes.

An ion-exchange process for recovery of antimony and bismuth from the copper electrorefining process has been studied on both a bench scale test and a pilot test. Recently, the ion exchange technique for the removal of antimony and bismuth from the electrolyte has been in a practice. In the existing technology, the metals recovered are required to process further. The separation of antimony and bismuth is sometime difficult and costly. Sumitomo Metal Mining has developed a noble process to recover antimony and bismuth metals directly from the eluent by an electrowinning. Furthermore, antimony and bismuth were successfully separated. The content of bismuth in antimony metal was less than 0.2%, while the content of antimony in bismuth metal was less than 0.4%.

THE USE OF POLYMER CONCRETE IN ACID CONTAINMENT EQUIPMENT FOR ELECTROMETALLURGICAL PLANT PRACTICE: </B> G.J. Karcas, Corrosion Technology International, Gent, Belgium
<P>
Various non-ferrous Metals such as Copper, Nickel, Lead, Zinc and Precious Metals are produced via electrorefining and electrowinning processes. Apart from controlling electro-chemical conditions for the production of these metals, there has always existed the challenge of controlling the severely deleterious effect of the aqueous environment which serves as the medium for the production of these metals. The practice of acid containment in electrometallurgical operations has entered the world of high technology with the advent of advanced acid resistant materials such as Vinyl Ester Resin which is either combined with concrete to form Polymer Concrete or used to coat or line various acid containing vessels and surfaces. The North and South American copper industry has indulged quite heavily in the use of polymer concrete cells, electrolyte storage tanks, and the use of Vinyl Ester Resin for corrosion protective systems. Electrolytic cell and electrolyte storage tank construction has undergone a transformation from a multiple part configuration to a single piece unit. The combination of a wood, steel, or concrete frame with a lining made of lead, asphalt, rubber or plastic has been historically successful in providing protection from chemical and mechanical attack in electrolytic cells and electrolyte storage tanks all over the world. These combinations have now entered the world of obsolescence as materials such as polymer concrete have proven to provide exceptional corrosion and mechanical protection with greatly reduced maintenance requirements. Polymer concrete cells and electrolyte storage tanks fall into the category of modern tankhouse equipment which includes anode preparation machines and stainless steel cathodes, all of which play a vital role in improving quality and productivity while lowering operating costs. Polymer Concrete Cells, and other modern equipment, are succeeding in the difficult, yet important, task of driving electrometallurgical plants into the next millennium.

POSSIBILITIES TO LOWER ENERGY USE IN ELECTROWINNING BY MODIFICATIONS OF LEAD ANODES: </B> O. Fors&eacute;n , J. Aromaa, Helsinki University of Technology, Laboratory of Corrosion and Material Chemistry, Vuorimiehentie 2, FIN-02150, Espoo, Finland
<P>
Lead alloys are most common anodes in metal electrowinning processes from acid solutions, even though their oxygen overpotential is very high. New inventions like mixed metal oxide anodes are not widely used, the main reasons being possibly doubts on the anode operation and large capital investments on the existing lead anodes. The main reaction on lead anodes in sulphate solutions is oxygen evolution, and on the lead dioxide film it has a high overpotential. In this paper we have studied possibilities to decrease the energy consumption in metal electrowinning by lowering the anode overpotential. Samples from currently used anode material were coated with different lead alloys using plasma spraying and detonation coating. Also modifications on the anode microstructure by melting and controlled cooling and additions of certain ions to the electrolyte were studied. Most of the studied procedures were able to lower the anode potential about 100 - 150 mV at the operating current density of 500 A/m2. Rapid cooling during the anode casting was found to be the simplest and thus also the least expensive way to lower the anode potential.

The pyrometallurgical method of recycling car batteries suffers from a potential for air pollution violations, which prompts the desire for a viable hydrometallurgical alternative. Several Processes have been proposed, including leach-electrowinning routes using HBF4 and/or H2SiF6 based electrolytes, along with anodes of PbO2 on inert substrates. A study has been carried out to evaluate the proposed systems, with the intention of demonstrating a six month life of an electrolyte-anode combination. The work, which focused on the use of H2SiF6, has indicated that there was no acceptable anode, and has lead to the development of a technique to produce smooth, glassy, adherent coatings on graphite, and to the development of an anode composed of a series of copper cored graphite rods. The paper will present results on leaching and electrowinning experiments, as well as the description of a flowsheet for a pilot plant that will be used to produce one tone per day of refined lead from spent battery paste.

APPLICATION OF ELECTROCHEMICAL MEMBRANE METHODS IN HYDROMETALLURGY OF COPPER: </B> A.S. Mustafinova, A.A. Zharmenov, Chemical-Metallurgical Institute, Karaganda, Republic of Kazakstan
<P>
Production of electrolytic copper is characterized by large volumes of acidic spent solutions the utilization of which requires considerable expenditures of neutralizing agents. At present, an economically substantiated technology does not exist for treatment of sulfuric acid rinse solutions and spent copper electrolyte which will allow for repeated use of the acid and the metal salts. Therefore, for this aim the most advantageous is the use of electromembrane methods. In the paper there is stated the essence of developed technologies which are distinguished by low waste and provide the extraction from the solutions of metallic copper, nickel and sulphuric acid. There are also considered methods of copper electrolyte processing allowing to regulate its composition by that or another component (H2SO4, Cu, Ni, As). On the base of the detailed study of the behaviour of various types of ion- exchanger membranes in copper-, nickel-, zinc-, arsenic- bearing sulphate solutions there is realized the selection of the most suitable membranes (MK-401, MA-411, MB-2 and MKL-1/MAL-2). Some variants of electromembrane processing of spent solutions of the hydrometallurgy process have passed productions tests on a number of copper-electrolyte enterprises of the countries of CIS (cooperation of Independent States). These tests showed high efficiency of developed methods.

While pyrometallurgy is an ancient art and hydrometallurgy can be traced to the Middle Ages, electrometallurgy is the most recent technology since it started only after the discovery of electric current in the ninteenth century. Davy, Faraday, and Bunsen laid the foundation of this technology which had a great impact on other areas of metallurgy, e.g., the liberation of aluminum for the first time from its salts. Once aluminum was available, it was used to liberate other metals from their oxides. Electrometallurgical processes, however, are capital intensive. Improvement of the present technology should be intensely investigated.

<P>
Pitches with a range of properties, e.g. Q.I. content, were carbonised to a final temperature of 1080&#176;C. The same pitches were co-carbonised with finely divided petroleum coke. Lc has been measured at the end of the carbonisation cycles and at intermediate points to track the status of carbonisation for different pitches and pitch/filler coke combinations. The original pitch Q.I. content and pitch aromaticity appear to influence the carbonisation pathway of the pitch and the pitch-coke mixtures according to Lc data. The properties of the filler coke also appear to influence the ultimate size of the crystallites formed in the binder matrix at the end of the carbonisation cycle. It appears that there is a variable degree of interaction between the filler coke and the pitch, with extent of the interaction depending on the properties of the two components. The results so far reinforce the importance of consistency in raw materials preparation and in the baking process if uniform anodes are to be produced.

ABSORPTION OF OXYGEN FROM AIR INTO COAL TAR PITCH</B>: <I>Jaromir Cibulec</I>, Daniel Kostal, DEZA Corporation, P.O. Box 28, 757 28 Valasske Mezirici, Czech Republic
<P>
Changes in the properties of coal tar pitch during contact with atmospheric oxygen were studied. There were found to be changes in the content of toluene insolubles and the melting point. These changes are dependent on the quantity of the absorbed oxygen and on the temperature of the pitch during absorption. As the reaction of the air with the pitch is very rapid, reaction speed is controlled by the speed of absorption of oxygen into the pitch. When surface of the pitch is motionless, the rate determining step of the reaction is controlled by the rate of absorption of the oxygen into the pitch which is dependent on the diffusion coefficient of molecular oxygen in air. When the surface of the pitch is agitated, the reaction rate is controlled by the rate of reaction of the oxygen with the pitch. The mechanism of the reaction is described and a practical application is discussed.

The carbonization has important impacts on the energy consumption and the productivity in anode baking.

Then the structures of the samples taken from the carbon pilot anodes with and without above additions were further investigated using X-ray diffraction and microscopic techniques. The remained S, Al and Fe in the carbons after heat treatments were also analysed. The coke yield, Lc value, and porosity will be presented against various heat treatment temperatures for different additions.

A petroleum pitch, specially developed for aluminum anodes was produced, at commercial scale, as a real alternative to coal tar pitch. Using a highly aromatic refinery stream and well designed process conditions, it is possible to produce the right chemical composition needed for a high quality binder material for anodes. Through a Dynamic Process Optimization study, the paste formulation and parameters were adjusted to produce full size anodes with 100 % petroleum pitch. The performance of baked anodes were similar to coal tar pitch anodes, with the advantage of a much lower content of cancerogenic Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH). Comparative green and baked anode properties, PAH emissions and storage stability test for molten pitch are presented.

Petroleum pitch as binder material of anodes has the great advantage, that the content of cancerogenic Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) compared to coal tar pitch is practically inexistent. In applying the correct content of pitch and through optimization of all process parameters during anode manufacturing, full size anodes with coal tar pitch (CTP) and petroleum pitch (PP) have been prepared in an anode plant. While baked anode properties for coal tar and petroleum pitch anodes are very similar, the PAH content can be reduced by 98 %.

Actually the main type of binding materials, used in the anode paste production is a coal tar pitch. This binder provides the necessary quality of anode, but its using is related to increased emissions of cancerogenous matters, especially, benzapyrene, into the anode paste and aluminium reduction plants. The cancerogenous danger could be considerably reduced if using, as a binding material in the anode paste production, pitch produced at the distillation of the mixture of coal resin and remainders after oil pyrolysis, called &quot;modified pitch&quot;. This report gives the results of laboratory investigations and industrial tests of anode paste, produced with using above mentioned binder, in the aluminium reduction. The laboratory investigations and industrial tests on Soderberg pots have shown, that by using the modified pitch we succeeded to produce anode paste of satisfactory quality. In this case we achieve a considerable reducing of the emissions of cancerogenous matters, namely benzapyrene, from the surface of anode.

Rotating impellers for injecting gas into aluminium melt are an often used in-line device to remove impurities. However, the treatment efficiency is seldom investigated, as the precise effect of flotation is not well understood. Moreover, the interpretation of the results obtained by measuring the inclusion content is not always obvious. For these reasons, it is sometimes observed that rotors work in an erroneous way. This paper illustrates how the variation of some parameters can affect, either in a good or a bad way, the efficiency of rotating impellers. The problematic of measurement techniques with some of their limitations will also be exposed. A special emphasis will be laid on inclusion removal.

Placing multiple dispersers on a single rotor shaft and injecting gas into the metal at each disperser increases this direct shearing, improving the efficiency of the in-line fluxing unit. Small dispersers can operate at high gas loading and high speed without vortexing. Small dispersers also allow smaller metal treatment units, reducing floor space requirements and metal holdup. This paper will summarize the theory behind the direct shearing approach and will present data illustrating the difference in trace element removal for single, double, and triple disperser rotors. Comparisons with other in-line fluxing equipment will also be presented.

The effects of fluxing grain refined molten aluminium with Ar/Cl2 gas mixtures have been studied both in the laboratory and during experimental casthouse trials. Samples taken during gas fluxing were subjected to chemical analysis and examined in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Detailed chemical analysis of agglomerates was undertaken in the SEM using energy dispersive X-ray analysis and the elements Na, K and F were found to be associated with TiB2 clusters. Results will be presented in detail and discussed in the context of previously published work on grain refiner characterization and wettability of TiB2 in liquid Al/salt mixtures.

The formation of a suspension of aluminum droplets in salt fluxes used during the refining and recycling of aluminum, leads to decreased aluminum recovery. To enhance the coalescence and recovery, it is required to remove the oxide layer formed on the surface of these small aluminum drops. Coalescence behaviour of aluminum droplets under a molten salt flux cover was investigated using a hot stage microscope at a temperature of 740&#176;C. Two salt systems were studied: i) an equal weight mixture of NaCl-KCl with chloride and fluoride additives and ii) the MgCl2-KCl system with fluoride additives. Chloride salts did nothing to enhance coalescence but fluoride additions to both salt systems removed the oxide film from the metal. NaF, KF and Na3AlF6 additives were the most effective salts at stripping away the oxide layer and promoting coalescence. As the concentration of MgCl2 increased, the ability of the droplets to coalesce decreased significantly.

KINETICS OF MAGNESIUM REMOVAL FROM ALUMINUM ALLOYS BY CHLORINE FLUXING:</B> Qian Fu, <I>J.W .Evans</I>, Dept. of Materials Science and Mineral Engineering, University of California, Berkeley CA 94720
<P>
Chlorine fluxing (sparging chlorine-argon mixtures into the melt) is a standard procedure for eliminating magnesium from Al-Mg alloys. The kinetics of the reactions/mass transport involved have not been extensively studied in the past. The paper describes an ongoing investigation of those kinetics. Much of the work to date has been using laboratory-scale melts with magnesium removal measured by analysis of samples. Techniques have been developed to measure both bubble frequency and bubble residence time in the melt, enabling estimation of the total interfacial area and, consequently, the intrinsic kinetics of the phenomena involved. It is observed that, above the melting point of MgCl2, there exists a &quot;critical Mg concentration&quot;. Above this critical concentration the reactions are sufficiently fast that all entering chlorine is converted to MgCl2 and there are negligible chlorine emissions. Below this concentration, Mg mass transport in the alloy appears to be rate-controlling. The results are interpreted in terms of a mathematical model for fluxing. The paper also describes the preliminary results of experiments on a larger scale (few tens kg alloy) in which bubble probes are used to detect the dispersion of gas injected into the melt and measure the interfacial area.

A technique was developed for the measurement of the interfacial tension between liquid metals and molten salts at elevated temperatures. The technique is based on the measurement of the capillary depression ocurring when a capillary, which is moved vertically down through the molten salt layer, passes through the salt/metal interface. The depression is measured by simultaneous video recording of the immersion height of the alumina capillary and the position of a liquid meniscus in a horizontal tube connected to the alumina capillary. The interfacial tension was measured in the following systems: aluminium and an equimolar melt of NaCl and KCl with several salt additions at 1000 K, aluminium and NaCl-NaF at 1123 K, and aluminium and NaCl-KF at 1123 K and aluminium and equimolar melt of NaCl-KCl with additions of NaF, KF, LiF, BaF2, SrF2, CaF2, Na3AlF6, MgF2 and AlF3. It was found that the interfacial tension decreases with increasing NaF, KF, LiF, CaF2, BaF2 and SrF2 additions, remains unchanged with AlF3 additions and slightly decreases with MgF2 and Na3AlF6 additions. Aluminium and equimolar melt of NaCl-KCl with additions of LiCl, AlCl3, BaCl2, CaCl2, MgCl2. All above chlorides slightly increase the interfacial tension in the system. Obtained data are compared with the ones found in literature and some conclusions for the aluminium refining and recycling were derived.

A comparative study on the efficiencies of Na2SiF6 and AlF3 for demagging molten aluminum by submerged powder injection is reported. Experimental trials carried out at a scale of 250 Kg molten metal furnace capacity showed that the higher efficiencies, ~ 70%, were attained by the use of the Na2SiF6 powder. The basic parameter to establish the comparison between the two demagging agents was the powder size, maintaining constant the other important parameters, e.g., initial magnesium content, carrier gas flow-to-powder flow ratio, pressure of the carrier gas, temperature of the bath, the dimensions of the reactor and the shape and dimensions of the injection lance. The removal efficiency was monitored analyzing the magnesium content in both the metal and the slag. The fumes produced were also analyzed, having found that the Na2SiF6 powders have the inconvenience of giving place to the generation of highly toxic SiF4 fumes.

Non-agglomerated nanopowders are becoming increasingly important for a number of commercial applications including UV-scattering, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), displays and catalysis, among others. We have developed a continuous nanopowder production process, called Chemical Vapor Condensation (CVC), which involves precursor pyrolysis and condensation in a reduced pressure environment. We have introduced a flat-flame combustor unit, operable at low pressures, as a heat source in place of the original hot wall reactor. The temperature profile is uniform across the entire face of the burner, therefore, the reactants experience the same processing history and the powder has a uniform particle size distribution. The modified process, called Combustion Flame-Chemical Vapor Condensation (CF-CVC), has been used to produce a range of non-agglomerated nanoparticles (3-50 nm average particle size) of single phase, multiphase, and multicomponent materials. Examples include Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3/SiO2 and Eu:Y2O3. The as-synthesized powder is fully pyrolyzed (characterized by TGA), has a high surface area (SiO2 &gt; 300 m2/g; TiO2 &gt; 80 m2/g), and is non-agglomerated (TEM and BET pore size distribution). In addition, when the superheated particles leaving the combustion flame impinge on a heated substrate, in situ sintering can occur. Nanoporous or dense films or multilayered thin film structures can be synthesized. We have demonstrated the scalability of the process by increasing the burner diameter. Design consideration, processing parameters, powder characteristics and the commercial potential for the powders will be discussed.

Nanostructured Materials present very unique properties which has allow several technological applications. In the case of chemical reactions nanostructured materials have been used as catalyst. It is know that reduction of the particle size to a few nanometers produce an increased catalytic activity. The origin of this activity has been attributed to the increase surface area. We will show in this paper that nanoparticles present an increased surface roughness. This roughness increases the number of kink which provide an excellent site for promoting chemical reactions. In order to characterized the roughness we have used a new technique which combines High Resolution Electron Microscopy with computer length, It will be also shown that in several cases, the particle size in the image do Dot correspond with the true particle size. A method to correct this problem will be discussed.

Nanostructured M50 type steel materials were prepared by hot pressing the precursor powders chemically synthesized using two different techniques, namely, thermal decomposition and co-reduction. During the hot press process, the precursor powders were transformed to nanocrystalline phases with the precipitation of carbides. Simultaneously the crystalline powders were densified. The densified samples were studied using both conventional and high resolution transmission electron microscopy.

Nanostructure W/Cu/Co powder have loosely agglomerated homogeneous clusters of nanoscale size W(<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/approx-equal.gif"> 50 nm), Cu. and Co particles. The density and microhardness of the sintered nanostructure W/Cu/Co increased with increasing of Co content from 0.1 to 0.7wt.%, but electrical conductivity drastically decreased with addition of Co. Full density for nanostructure W/Cu/Co was achieved when sintered at 1473K for 20 minutes in H2 atmosphere with addition of 0.5wt.%Co. It was proved that optimum Co content is under 0.5wt.% when based on the relations between electrical conductivity and density. It is shown that nanostructure W/Cu/Co have higher sinterability and better electrical conductivity than conventional W/Cu/Co.

The Materials Science curriculum in many Universities is a direct descendant of their Metallurgy or Metallurgical Engineering curriculum. As such, they often have in them &quot;relics&quot; of the past that seem to some to be outdated. One of the theses of this presentation is that some of the &quot;relics&quot; are indeed &quot;holy relics&quot; which if they are discarded by &quot;reforming zealots&quot; may lead to a crisis in the curriculum. A second thesis, is that indeed some of the elements of the curriculum must be changed in order to better prepare our students for the changing directions of the field. In this presentation the important elements which should remain are discussed as are some new themes that currently are not universally present in our curricula.

The College of Engineering at the University of Michigan has begun an ambitious program to restructure its undergraduate curriculum. The new curriculum will increase freshman year participation in engineering and provide an active program for each student to learn communication skills throughout the curriculum, while increasing flexibility within all discipline-specific curricula. Furthermore the new approach calls for the restructuring of courses into 4 credit-hour units, thereby enabling students to complete their studies in 4 years by selecting 4 courses of 4 credit hours in each of 8 semesters for a total of 128 credit hours. The impact of this new curriculum template on Materials Science and Engineering education at Michigan will be described. Emphasis will be placed on proposed changes in laboratory and design courses to accommodate a strong and professionally administered engineering communications segment.

The NIST Solder Interconnect Design Team has been found to address several pressing issues in the design and fabrication of circuit board. Having met frequently over the past three years, in partnership with academic and industrial researchers, the Team has established an agenda for solving solder joint shape, and the consequential thermal/mechanical properties of the formed joint. Our ultimate goal is to provide the industrial community with a suite of useful software tools for solder interconnect design, and to provide solved test problems (available electronically on the World Wide Web), that can be modified to suit the needs of the particular user. With this in mind we are actively supporting the development of software which will interface the public domain program Surface Evolver, which has been shown to be quite capable at computing equilibrium meniscus shapes. A discussion of the outstanding problems, as well as the software tools under development will be presented.

MODELING NON-ISOTHERMAL INTERMETALLIC LAYER GROWTH IN THE 63Sn-37Pb SYSTEM:</B> <I>Paul T. Vianco</I>, P.L. Hopkins, K.L. Erickson, D.R. Frear, R. Davidson, Department 1831, Mail Stop 0340, P.O. Box 5800, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM 87185

The reliability of mechanical and electronic systems can be acutely dependent on the integrity of the soldered joints used in their assembly. During product manufacture, intermetallic layers from in reaction zones between the dissimilar materials of solder joints. Thermal cycling during service can cause further growth of the intermetallic layer, which may jeopardize the mechanical integrity of the joint as well as its capacity for rework or repair later on. Models describing service-related changes to solder joint microstructure are essential to understanding and predicting the long-term mechanical reliability and serviceability of these interconnects. In previously published work (J. Electronic Materials, v. 23, No. 8, 1994, pp. 721-729) a model describing the diffusion-controlled growth of multiple intermetallic layers and the displacement of the interfaces between layers was developed and implemented in a one-dimensional computer code based on the method-of-lines. The model can accommodate cases involving: (1) finite initial layer thickness, (2) rate-limiting interfacial reactions, (3) multiple and variable diffusion coefficients, and (4) finite material boundaries. Additionally, the effects of nucleation can be modeled empirically. A transformation of spatial coordinate circumvented the need to remesh the growing and (or) shrinking layers. Results from the one-dimensional code were verified by comparing the numerical output with analytical solutions for simple systems involving two, three, and five layers. The computer code was then applied for analysis of intermetallic layer growth from solder aging experiments performed with 100Sn and 63Sn-37Pb solders. The analysis indicated that intermetallic layer growth was consistent with bulk diffusion mechanism involving Cu and (or) Sn and variable diffusion coefficients that reflect some enhanced diffusion during early growth. In this work, non-isothermal solder-aging experiments were done with the 63Sn-37Pb/Cu system using two temperature histories: a low frequency history consisting of 4 cycles per day between -50 and 170&#176;C, and a high frequency history consisting of 72 cycles per day and the same limits. Thicknesses of both the Cu3Sn and Cu6Sn5 intermetallic layers were determined as a function of time for both temperature histories. An enhanced version of the previously developed model was used to predict the non-isothermal intermetallic layer growth for both temperature histories. Arrhenius expressions for diffusion coefficients in both the Cu3Sn and Cu6Sn5 layers were determined using experimental data from previous isothermal studies. This paper describes the non-isothermal experiments and a comparison of calculated and observed layer growth as a function of time. This work was performed at Sandia National Laboratories and supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under contract DE-AC04-94AL8500.

The fatigue-induced solder joint failure of surface mounted electronic devices has become one of the most critical reliability issues in electronic packaging industry. Solder joint reliability performance has been found to be highly dependent on the solder joint configuration, which, in turn, is governed by bond pad size, component weight, alloy material, and leadframe structure, as well as solder reflow characteristics. The objective of this work is to develop numerical models: 1) to simulate the solder joint formation during the reflow process; 2) to determine the stress/strain distribution within the joint; and 3) further predict the reliability (fatigue life) of the solder joints. The solder joint formation process during solidification stage can be simulated using the Surface Evolver software tool developed by University of Minnesota. The thermomechanical stress-strain analysis can then be carried out using ANSYS to study selected critical design/manufacturing parameters such as leadframe geometry, pad size and dimensions, solder paste volume, leadframe placement misalignment, etc. This effort also involves the development of interface linking Surface Evolver and ANSYS.

The most commonly used solder for electrical interconnects in electronic packages is the near eutectic 60Sn-40Pb alloy. This alloy has a number of processing advantages (suitable melting point of 183&#176;C and good wetting behavior). However, under conditions of cyclic strain and temperature (thermomechanical fatigue) the microstructure of this alloy undergoes a heterogeneous coarsening and failure process that makes prediction of solder joint lifetime complex. A visco-plastic, microstructural dependent, constitutive model for solder has been developed and implemented into a finite element code. With this computational capability, the thermomechanical response of solder interconnects, including microstructural evolution, can be predicted. This capability was applied to predict the thermomechanical response of various solder interconnects to determine the effects of variations in geometry and loading. In this paper, the constitutive model will be briefly discussed and response predicted by the constitutive model will be compared to material test results. Finally, the results of computational studies to determine the effect of geometry and loading variations will be presented.

AN ELASTOPLASTIC BEAM MODEL FOR COLUMN-GRID-ARRAY (CGA) SOLDER INTERCONNECTS:</B> <I>Steven M. Heinrich</I>*, J.A. Swanson*, and P.S. Lee**; *Rockwell Automation, Allen-Bradley Co., Milwaukee, WI 53233; **Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI 53233

A semi-analytical model is developed and implemented to analyze the deformation of solder columns in column-grid-array (CGA) assemblies. Each solder column is modeled as a prismatic beam of circular cross-section, subjected to end shearing deflections caused by thermal mismatch between the module and the circuit board. The solder is idealized as an elastic-perfectly plastic material whose yielding is governed by the Von Mises criterion. Since the columns are relatively short, transverse shear deformation has been incorporated into the beam model. The results generated with the model indicate the following: (a) yielding is governed by <I>bending</I> for slenderness ratios (height-to-diameter) of h/d<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gtequalto.gif">1/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/squareroot.gif">3; (b) the nonlinear stiffness relationship for a sheared column, presented in dimensionless form, reduces to a <I>single</I> curve which is valid for <I>arbitrary</I> values of slenderness ratio (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gtequalto.gif">1/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/squareroot.gif">3) and material parameters; (c) the dimensionless relationship between maximum shear strain (in the Tresca sense) and the relative end deflection depends on Poisson's ratio but is independent of the other material parameters and the slenderness ratio. The nonlinear stiffness results presented in the paper may be used to create more efficient finite element models of entire assemblies by replacing each column with a single nonlinear spring element. When used in conjunction with an appropriate Coffin-Manson relationship, the maximum shear strain curves presented herein may be utilized to estimate column fatigue life.

EFFECT OF ASSEMBLY STIFFNESS AND TEMPERATURE CYCLE PARAMETERS ON THERMOMECHANICAL RESPONSE OF SOLDER JOINTS:</B><I> Ahmer Syed</I>, Delco Electronics Corporation, M/S T100-26, 700 East Firman Drive, Kokomo, IN 46904
<P>
Grain boundary sliding and matrix creep are recognized as the main contributors to creep behavior of eutectic Sn/Pb solder joints in thermomechanical loading. The relative contribution and dominance of these mechanisms in the total response is governed by the external (temperature, assembly stiffness, CTE mismatch) as well as the internal shape (shape, size and thickness of the solder joint) factors. This paper examines the effect of external factors on the grain boundary and matrix creep response of solder joints. Experimental as well as numerical techniques are employed to compare which mechanism dominates under several different assembly stiffness and temperature profile conditions. A fatigue life prediction model which accounts for different mechanisms is used to determine the impact of grain boundary sliding and matrix creep on solder joint fatigue life.

BEHAVIOR OF SOLDER JOINTS UNDER COMPLEX DISPLACEMENT LOADING</B>: <I>Matthew G. Bevan</I>, Manfred Wutting, The John Hopkins University, Applied Physics Laboratory, John Hopkins Road, Laurel, MD 20723
<P>
In many applications, solder is exposed to a complex fatigue spectrum composed of thermal effects, shock and vibration. In the laboratory; however, solder is usually tested using simple wave forms generated by mechanical testers or by thermal cycling. In order to apply laboratory results to predict the real world fatigue, several crucial steps are necessary. One of these steps is understanding how to combine the effects of simple displacement (or stress) waves to predict the effects of complex waves. One method of combining waves is to use a linear damage accumulation model employing rainflow analysis. Briefly, rainflow analysis establishes an envelope to strain (or stress) range of the waveform, and then measures the reversals within the range. Damage from the envelope is added to the damage from the individual reversals within the envelope to calculate the damage of the whole cycle. The linear damage accumulation model is not valid for all loading conditions. Damage is accumulated in a linear fashion, assuming there is no wave-to-wave interaction. For Mode I (tensile) loading, this assumption is known to be false. Six mechanisms for-wave-to-wave interaction are known. The wave-to-wave interaction can significantly accelerate or delay fatigue crack propagation. In contrast, Mode III (tearing) loading has shown no wave-to-wave interaction. Very little research has been done to investigate damage accumulation in solder. The paper looks at single solder joints in shear. First the fatigue behavior of the solder joints is characterized using sine waves under displacement control. Then by looking at sums of waves with a constant displacement envelope, the damage from minor waves may be separated from damage from the major, envelope wave. The results show that the linear damage accumulation model (using rainflow analysis) is accurate as long as the minor waves remain in the elastic range. Once the minor waves begin to generate plastic deformation, the damage accumulates more rapidly than predicted.

THERMOMECHNICAL FATIGUE TESTING OF SOLDER ALLOYS:</B> <I>Mark A. Palmer</I>, P.E. Redmond, R.W. Messler, Jr., Materials Science and Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 12180
<P>
Thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) is one of the most common sources of failure in solder joints. TMF occurs due to thermal cycling, as a cyclic stress is induced on the solder joint due to thermal expansion mismatch. Due to the complicated nature of thermomechanical fatigue, directly testing a material's resistance to TMF is not straight forward. A novel test apparatus has been developed which allows the direct measurement of stress due to thermal cycling. The TMF behavior of three alloys, eutectic Sn-Bi, Sn-Pb, and Sn-Ag as examined by this apparatus will be presented. The data will be compared with that generated by other test methods.

EVOLUTION OF GRAIN STRUCTURE IN THIN FILM REACTIONS:</B> <I>K. Barmak</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA 18015
<P>
The granular nature of polycrystalline thin films is playing an increasingly important role in their performance as the dimensions of the grains and those structures in which the thin films are used become comparable. Consequently, greater attention is being paid to the factors that affect the grain structure of thin films and its evolution. This paper will address the evolution of grain structure during the reaction of polycrystalline thin films. Experimental evidence from calorimetry, x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy studies of a number of thin film systems will be reviewed and the role of reactant phase microstructure in these reactions will be highlighted. Theoretical models that combine nucleation and growth processes in the formation of the product phase will be presented and the impact of heterogeneous boundary nucleation on the evolution of grain structure in thin film reactions will be discussed.

Recent developments in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have created a need for stronger metal thin films that are resistant to stress relaxation. Intermetallic compounds are noted for their strength and resistant to creep, but these properties have rarely been studied in thin films of intermetallics. We have sputter deposited layered structures of copper and gold so that the intermetallic compounds Cu3Au, CuAu and CuAu3 would form. The samples were initial heated to 475&#176;C to allow intermixing of the copper and gold layers and the evolution of the intrinsic and extrinsic stresses were characterized during the process. The samples were then annealed at temperatures where the intermetallic phases would form. The intermetallic phases were tested for strength and stress relaxation using a Tencor Flexus 2320. The microstructure and composition were examined with TEM, EDX, Electron Microprobe, and X-Ray diffraction. This data allows us to relate strength and resistance to stress relaxation to microstructure and the heat of formation of the various copper gold intermetallic compounds.

CHARACTERIZATION OF GRAIN BOUNDARIES IN Al INTERCONNECTS BY ORIENTATION IMAGING MICROSCOPY:</B> <I>C. Wu</I>, C.L. Bauer, B.L. Adams, W.W. Mullins, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA
<P>
Characterization of microstructure (grain orientation, grain-boundary inclination, microtexture, etc.) in thin-film interconnects is especially important because grain size usually approximates film thickness, thereby enhancing short-circuit diffusion induced by electric fields (electromigration), mechanical stress (stress voiding), temperature gradients (thermomigration), and capillarity (grain-boundary grooving). In this research, grain boundaries in polycrystalline Al interconnects have been characterized by orientation imaging microscopy and analyzed in terms of the interconnectivity of triple junctions. In general, results indicate that a variety of thermodynamic and kinetic properties can be extracted by rapid acquisition and processing of large data sets and correlated with the (five) degrees of crystallographic freedom of individual grain boundaries.

Understanding and controlling the microstructure in thin metal films used for IC interconnects is essential for maintaining high reliability. Although the microstructure of Al films has been heavily studied, the switch to Cu for interconnects in the future will lead to different microstructural evolution than in current technology. In order to study the kinetics of grain growth and texture evolution, we have developed an in situ X-ray system that can measure the concurrent evolution of (111) and (100) textured crystallites during annealing. We present results from the annealing of Ag films, which have similar elastic properties to Cu. This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under contract DE-AC04.

STRESS RELAXATION AND THERMAL EVOLUTION OF FILM PROPERTIES IN AMORPHOUS CARBON:</B> <I> J.P. Sullivan</I>, Sandia National Labs, Albuquerque, NM 87185
<P>
Large stress relaxation is observed in amorphous carbon films deposited by pulsed-laser deposition which are subsequently thermally annealed. In the as-deposited state, the films exhibit very high compressive stress, &gt; 6 GPa, which has been thought to be either necessary or unavoidable in order to form a high percentage of 4-fold coordinated (diamond-like) carbon bonds and which can also hamper important electronic applications of these films. Stress measurements performed in situ and ex situ following thermal annealing up to 600&#176;C indicate the stress may be reduced nearly two orders of magnitude. The stress relaxation is not dominated by interfacial relaxation nor is it accompanied by large scale changes within the film (e.g. graphitization) as indicated by in situ and ex situ electrical measurements, ex situ X-ray reflectivity, Raman spectroscopy, and experiments using different substrates. The bonding structure and mechanisms of thin film evolution in these unique amorphous films will be discussed. Work at Sandia was supported by an LDRD through the U.S. DOEunder contract no.

<P>
Cubic boron nitride (cBN) is an sp3-bonded material with many properties and applications that are similar to diamond. Although cBN can be synthesized in bulk form at high temperature and pressure, synthesis in thin film form requires the simultaneous bombardment of the growing film with a high flux of energetic ions. cBN films grow with a unique, layered microstructure in which sp2-bonded graphitic boron nitride initially forms near the substrate interface, and nucleation and growth of the sp3-bonded cubic phase occurs further up in the film. Both the graphitic and cubic layers exhibit strong preferential crystallographic orientations: the graphitic layer possesses a strong in-plane [0002] orientation, whereas the cBN possesses an in-plane [111] orientation. This preferential orientation is consistent with an alignment between the cBN {111} planes and the basal planes of the layer of highly oriented graphitic boron nitride that forms in the initial stages of film growth. This relationship provides insight into the mechanisms controlling the initial nucleation of cBN and subsequent microstructural evolution of the films. This work is supported by the U. S. Department of Energy under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 and in part by OBES-DMS.

<P>
Metallic oxide SrRuO3 thin films have been grown using pulsed laser deposition on LaAlO3 substrates at different substrate temperatures. The surface morphology and microstructural properties of the SrRuO3/LaAlO3 system have been studied using high resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction, conventional x-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Electrical properties of SrRuO3 thin films with different microstructures have been measured. It is found that films deposited at 250&#176;C are amorphous, and show semiconductor-like temperature dependence of electrical conductivity. Films deposited at 425&#176;C are crystalline with very fine grain size (100~200&Aring;), and show both metallic and semiconductor-like temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity in different temperature regions. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy unambiguously indicate that epitaxial [001] and [110] growth of the orthorhombic films takes place for deposition temperature above 650&#176;C, where the [001] texture is dominant. Films deposited at 775&#176;C show a resistivity of 280 mW-cm at room temperature. Microstructures of epitaxially grown films and possibilities for improving the thin film growth are discussed, based on geometric considerations for both film and substrate. The optimized deposition conditions to grow SrRuO3 thin films on LaAlO3 substrates have been found. Possible engineering applications of SrRuO3 thin films with different microstructures are discussed.

THE ROLE OF GRAIN SIZE AND SELECTED MICROSTRUCTURAL PARAMETERS IN STRENGTHENING FULLY-LAMELLAR TiAl ALLOYS:</B> <I>D.M.

<P>
More than five years ago wrought processing was first used to produce fully-lamellar microstructures in TiAl alloys having grain sizes less than ~400mm. These alloys exhibit an improvement in overall balance of properties, especially at high temperatures. More recently, such microstructural forms led to exceptional yield strengths (&gt;1000Mpa at low temperatures), while maintaining attractive high-temperature properties. The improvements appeared to be attained principally through an unusually high apparent sensitivity of strength on grain size. Studies reported an apparent value for the slope of the &quot;Hall-Petch plot&quot; approaching 5 Mpa<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/squareroot-m.gif"> for fully lamellar gamma alloys, while that for single phase or duplex microstructures is near unity. The present investigations examine the slope of the Hall-Petch plot for fully lamellar microstructures, paying particular attention to the lamellar microstructural variables. Results show that <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2-lamella thickness and spacing, and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-lamella thickness can vary over more than two orders-of-magnitude. These in turn influence the value of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/sigma.gif">o in the Hall Petch plot, and often change concomitantly with grain size in processing. Nonetheless, the corrected value of the Hall-Petch constant exceeds a magnitude of 2 Mpa<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/squareroot-m.gif">; and it is strain dependent. The investigations also examine dislocation activity, flow behavior, glide barriers and slip multiplicity for polysynthetically twinned or PST crystals (single-grain analogue of fully lamellar material), then map this behavior into an explanation of the yield behavior of high strength fully lamellar gamma alloys.

Internal stresses necessarily develop in multilayered coherent materials with mismatched lattice parameters as the individual layers adjust to their neighbors. In Ti-Al the layers consist of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 plates and six orientation variants of gamma plates which occur in an apparently random sequence. The internal stresses in any one layer are affected by the orientations of all its neighbors. We have calculated, in closed form, the stresses present in one layer of a stack of gamma layers in which the sequence of variants is in any order and of any length and in which the thicknesses of each layer may take any value. In addition we have calculated the stresses in a stack of alternating <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> layers of arbitrary thicknesses. The results are applicable directly to an idealized form of PST TiAl in which the domain size is large and the lamellae thickness is small. The relaxation of internal stresses which occurs in thick lamellae and by the formation of domains is discussed. The consequences of both these relaxations to the plastic strength of PST TiAl are examined.

TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT DEFORMATION IN GAMMA TITANIUM ALUMINIDES:</B> <I>S.H. Whang</I>, Z.M. Wang, Q. Feng, C. Wei, Polytechnic University, Six Metrotech Center, Brooklyn, NY 11201
<P>
Deformation of gamma titanium aluminides may be best described by the lack of sufficient ductility at RT as well as intermediate temperatures, and the anomalous yielding at high temperatures. Such deformation behavior is mainly attributed to unusual behavior of two independent slip systems: superdislocation slip and ordinary dislocation slip, both of which simultaneously operate over the entire temperature range in the polycrystalline alloys. For this reason, the study on the role of individual slip system is required to carry out deformation experiments with single crystals of a <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl alloy. In <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-Ti-56Al, the yield stress curves of superdislocation slip show positive temperature dependence over two distinct temperature regimes while those for ordinary dislocation slip exhibit a single temperature range. These distinct temperature regimes can be explained with the characteristic features of the dislocation structures which were obtained from the postmortem examinations of the deformed specimens conducted by TEM. The thermodynamic aspects of both cross-slip configurations of superdislocations will be presented based on anisotropy strain energy calculations. Finally, the CRSS values depend on deformation orientation in superdislocation slip, in consistent with the cross-slip models. The details of the orientation dependence will be discussed.

PLASTIC INSTABILITIES IN <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma-bold.gif">-TiAl AND THEIR RELATION TO WORK HARDENING AND TOUGHNESS:</B> <I>Fran&ccedil;ois Louchet</I>, Groupe Physique du Metal, LTPCM- UMR.CNRS/INPG/UJF, B.P. 75, Domaine Universitaire, 38402 - St Martin d'H'eres, France
<P>
Flow stress anomaly in <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl is associated, as in many other intermetallics, to a strain rate sensitivity (SRS) close to zero, to plastic instabilities, and to a high work hardening rate (WHR). In situ TEM observations also show a jerky motion of groups of cusped ordinary screw dislocations (1), in agreement with macroscopic instabilities. The present paper investigates these instabilities in the framework of the Local Pinning Unzipping (LPU) model (2), in which the flow stress anomaly and the low value of the SRS are predicted as a consequence of a balance between dislocation exhaustion and multiplication rates. This balance is applied here to groups of N dislocations, and results in a non linear equation in N, from which the minimum stress required to deform the material at a given strain rate can be determined. The corresponding average value of N is obtained as a function of temperature. The consequences of the temperature dependence of N on both WHR and toughness are discussed. Possible consequences on the particular dramatic brittleness of PST materials loaded perpendicular to lamellar boundaries (3), in which slip in <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl takes place across lamellae, can also be contemplated as a function of these instabilities, and particularly in terms of the variations with temperature of the number N of dislocations in pile-ups.

The <B>b</B>=1/2&lt;110] unit dislocations are a dominant part of the deformation substructure in both single phase (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">) and two-phase (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">) TiAl alloys, at ambient temperatures and above. These dislocations have been characterized in a coarse-grained (~300 mm) single-phase binary TiAl alloy. The results show that these dislocations undergo double cross-slip, resulting in numerous pinning points (jogs) and mixed character dislocation segments bowed about these pinning points, giving rise to a cusped morphology. The linear pinning-point density in single-phase alloys increases with deformation temperature from ~2-5 mm-1 at RT, to ~10 mm-1 at higher temperatures, with an attendant increase in the yield strength of the alloy. In two-phase (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">) fully-lamellar polycrystals and PST crystals the, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> lamellae thicknesses are typically ~1mm, which is approximately the same order as the free-segment length of the unit dislocations in the single-phase alloys. Hence, the morphological evolution of 1/2&lt;110] unit dislocations in the fully lamellar material, wherein deformation propagation is constrained by the lamellae dimensions, is of particular interest. Transmission electron microscopy observations pertaining to these aspects, and their implications on strength and plasticity, will be discussed in the presentation.

<P>
Understanding of the deformation mechanisms that lead to the flow strength anomaly of Ni3Al has been greatly enhanced by the measurement of the orientation dependence of flow stress and tension/compression asymmetry. To date, lack of high quality single crystals sufficiently large to facilitate mechanical testing have precluded such studies of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> TiAl. High quality single crystals of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-Ti(55.5%)Al have been grown using an optical float zone furnace, which provides a containerless growing environment.

WINTER HEAP LEACHING AT PEGASUS GOLD'S BEAL MOUNTAIN MINE:</B>J.E. Micheletti, <I>T.J. Weitz</I>, Beal Mountain Mining, Inc., Anaconda, MT 59711
<P>
Pegasus Gold's Beal Mountain Mine is located near the Continental Divide, SW Montana. Conventional surface mining utilizes crushing, heap leaching, carbon absorption/desorption, electrowinning and refining to produce approximately 60,000 oz gold annually. A leach pad sits at 2,300 meters (7,500 ft) elevation. Winters are long and cold with average snow accumulations of 1-2 meters; temperatures fall below minus 40&#176;C and wind chill temperatures below 70&#176;C. The Beal Mountain staff has developed special tools and procedures for burying drip emitter lines, and managing the heap and process solutions to allow for uninterrupted gold recovery during the winter season. Management of water balance and spring runoff is critical to the operations' success, due to mountainous terrain, high precipitation and proximity to a fishery and elk herd.<B> </B>The mine has an extensive network of land application disposal (LAD) and stormwater control systems to assure environmental protection and regulatory compliance.

OVERCOMING CLIMATOLOGY LIMITATIONS ON HEAP LEACHING:</B> <I>J.J. Komadina,</I> Executive Vice President, Pikes Peak Mining Company, Victor, CO; R.R. Beebe, Consultant, Tucson, AZ 85751-2O48
<P>
Heap leaching of gold ores has enjoyed wide acceptance in the arid and semi-arid regions of the western U.S., Australia and South America. There are areas, however, where cold weather or excessive precipitation can limit the usefulness of heap leaching. Even in Nevada, difficulties can be encountered which call for special operating procedures. This paper discusses general climatological limitations and some of the techniques used to extend heap leaching into colder conditions. A case history of the Pikes Peak operation in Colorado examines &quot;Valley-fill&quot; technology as an ideal cold-climate solutions, where topographical conditions permit.

Environmental regulatory requirements for discharge of solutions and closure of operations for the gold mineral processing industry have been moving towards meeting USEPA inorganic drinking water standards. Use of jar tests for water treatment process development is suitable for preliminary scoping work, conducted in a research laboratory for optimization studies, and at the site of the water treatment. Experimental methods utilize standard jar test equipment in effort to produce solutions that meet standards for USEPA inorganic drinking water, after chemical treatment of cyanide solutions. The materials tested included gold-bearing pregnant solutions from heap leach operations, gold plant barren solutions from Merrill-Crowe zinc cementation gold recovery process and final gold heap-leach wash solutions after carbon-in-column recovery. Experiments include cyanide destruction with sodium hypochlorite, and arsenic co-precipitation coupled with mercury precipitation.

THE EFFECT OF PROCESSING ON THE MICROSTRUCTURE OF Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox/Ag SUPERCONDUCTOR: </B><I>K. Togano</I>, H. Kumakura, H. Kitaguchi, H. Fujii, National Research Institute for Metals, Tsukuba 305, Japan; T. Hasegawa, Y. Hikichi, Showa Electric Wire and Cable Co., Ltd., Kawasaki 210, Japan
<P>
The Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox/Ag(2212) conductors with high Jc can be fabricated by applying partial melting process, in which the 2212 phase melts incongruently. However, the presence of nonsuperconducting solid phases in the liquid makes it very difficult to achieve an ideal grain alignment of 2212 phase on cooling. In this paper, we report detailed studies on the distribution of nonsuperconducting phases and its effect on the nucleation and growth behavior of 2212 crystals. As one of the methods to control the distribution, we applied centrifugal gravity fields of up to ~100 g to the samples during melting process. Gravity effect was more significant for thick 2212 conductor, for which interface effect was less dominant. The improvement of grain alignment for the multilayered Ag/2212 conductors and the results of Jc measurement will be presented.

REACT-WIND-AND-SINTER TECHNIQUE FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF POWDER-IN-TUBE Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox COILS:</B> <I>J. Schwartz, </I>S. Boutemy, National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, 1800 E. Dirac Dr., Tallahassee, FL 32310
<P>
Heat treating powder-in-tube Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox coils such that short sample properties are obtained in large quantities is an important challenge. The wind-and-react technique suffers from poor temperature control due to the coil thermal mass and the sensitivity of the superconductor to the peak temperature and cooling rates. With the react-and-wind approach, however, optimum conductor performance is not obtained since it is degraded by strain during winding. A new technique is being developed at the NHMFL: the react-wind-and-sinter technique. Long lengths of powder-in-tube conductor are reacted by pulling the tape through a furnace with a controlled atmosphere. The temperature profile is controlled to emulate the partial-melt step of the conventional heat treatment. This method allows a more uniform reaction in long lengths of conductor. The tape is then insulated and wound into the desired coil shape and sintered isothermally. This repairs the cracks and achieves high phase purity and grain alignment. Here we report progress on this approach for HTS coils.

DEVELOPMENT OF LONG LENGTH Bi-2212 SUPERCONDUCTORS: </B><I>R. Wesche</I>, EPFL, Centre de Recherches en Physique des Plasmas, CH-5232 Villigen PSI, Switzerland
<P>
Superconducting AgNiMg and Ag/Bi-2212 multicore wires of up to 40 m length have been fabricated by the powder-in-tube method. The optimum heat treatment conditions and the critical temperature have been found to depend on the wire diameter and the matrix material. In addition, the cooling rates are of importance for the achievable Tc values. Generally, the AgNiMg-sheathed wires behave like thinner Ag/Bi-2212 wires. Maximum Tc values of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/approx-equal.gif"> 92K have been achieved for both matrix materials. These observations suggest very rapid grain-boundary assisted diffusion of oxygen through the AgNiMg matrix. Short sample jc values (1 mV/cm) of up to 80,000 A/cm2 (4.2 K, B=0) and 3000 A/cm2 (77 K, B=0) have been achieved in Ag/Bi-2212 multicore wires of 1 mm diameter. For AgNiMg/Bi-2212 multicore wires of 1.5 mm diameter maximum zero field jc values of 55,000 and 2000 A/cm2 have been reached at 4.2 and 77K, respectively. First results for the jc values in Bi-2212 wires of long lengths will be presented.

<P>
Y123 and Bi2223 bulks were hot compressed isothermally in a temperature range of 780-850&#176;C under constant stresses of 15-50 MPa for 60 min. It was found that the mass density of the bulk Y123 and Bi2223 superconductors has been increased. This was achieved by reducing the enclosed voids in the materials under the pressure at high temperature. In addition of high mass density, texture structure in the superconductors has also been improved by hot compressing which in turn increased critical current of both materials. Ag-sheathed Bi2223 wires were hot-rolled into thin tapes at about 800&#176;C at a four-high laboratory rolling machine with attachment of a tube furnace. It was found that hot-rolled tapes had higher core mass density but sausaging was severer than cold-rolled samples. Apart from the hot rolling, the Bi2223 tapes were also hot compressed under the condition of uniaxial loading and it was found that the treatment enhanced the core density, resulting in the improvement of the critical current of the samples.

EFFECT OF pO2, C, AND Ag ON THE DECOMPOSITION PATHWAYS IN THE Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O: </B><I>R.W. McCallum</I>, L. Margulies, K.W. Dennis, M.J. Kramer, Ames Laboratory, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011
<P>
The promise of usable forms of high temperature superconducting wires and tapes rests on developing techniques for processing highly textured materials. Understanding the effect of Ag and pO2 on the chain of peritectic reactions initiated during melting is necessary in order to optimize the processing parameters of Bi-Ca-Sr-Cu-O-Ag composites. Previously, work on the solubility of Ag in the Bi2212 melt revealed a large liquid immiscibility gap and a eutectic on each side of this gap. In addition, the sub-liquidus phase reactions in this system were examined in greater detail for 0.01, 0.2, and 1.0 bar pO2. This work showed that the peritectic reactions varied as a function of pO2. The role of Ag was shown only to depress the peritectic decomposition temperatures. C was shown to have only a very minor effect for near stoichiometric materials. This work is currently being extended to the Bi2221 + Ag system.

THICK-FILM PROCESSING FOR TL-OXIDE WIRE AND TAPE:</B> <I> R.D. Blaugher</I>, R.N. Bhattacharya, D. Ginley, P. Parilla, D. Schulz, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO 80401
<P>
Thick-film processing using techniques such as dip coating, ink spraying and electrodeposition represent promising approaches for fabricating HTS wire or tape for the Tl-oxide superconductors. The wire and tape processing for long lengths of the Tl-oxides, in contrast to the Bi-materials, is not as well advanced due primarily to a lower level of effort. The Tl-oxides, moreover, offer the potential for operation at 77K in practical magnetic fields of 3-5 T, which is supported by measurements on the irrreversibility behavior of the Tl-1223 single layer compound with Pb and Sr substitution. Thick-film processing methods such as electrodeposition and ink spraying present a viable approach for producing a cost effective HTS wire or tape with technologically acceptable transport properties. This paper will review the progress in the Tl-oxide wire and tape processing for thick-film techniques. The relative merits of conventional mixed-oxide and highly reactive sub-micron precursor as prepared by electrodeposition will be discussed. The prospects and predicted cost for a &quot;long length&quot; thick-film process using electrodeposition and ink spraying will also be presented.

THE EFFECTS OF CARBON ON TlBa2Ca2Cu3Ox PHASE FORMATION IN THE Tl(F)-Ba-Ca-Cu-O SYSTEM:</B> <I>Y.S. Sung</I>, X.F. Zhang, P.J. Kostic, D.J. Miller, Materials Science Division and Science and Technology Center for Superconductivity, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439
<P>
The effects of carbon on TlBa2Ca2Cu3Ox phase formation in the Tl(F)-Ba2Ca2Cu3Oz system have been investigated. Samples of varying carbon content were prepared by controlling the carbon content in the Ba2Ca2Cu3Oz precursor powders that were mixed with TlF and reacted to form the superconducting phase. The samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and DC magnetization. It was found that carbon induced the formation of the Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3Oy phase. While TlBa2Ca2Cu3Ox was the primary phase at low carbon contents, Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3Oy became the dominant phase at high carbon contents, in spite of a 1:2:2:3 (Tl:Ba:Ca:Cu) starting composition. For intermediate carbon levels, there was a strong tendency to form superlattices as a result of intergrowth between TlBa2Ca2Cu3Ox and Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3Oy.

We have investigated a number of practical aspects in the manufacture of demonstrator coils from Tl-1223 PIT tape. Coils have been fabricated using a wind and react method from 5 m tapes with an insulating MgO coating, giving engineering Jc values of 2500 Acm-2. However, the performance of these sintered tapes in external magnetic field is at present poor. Previous work has suggested that only improved grain alignment can overcome this weak link problem and we have chosen to investigate a melt processing route in order to achieve this. A considerable effort has been put into correlating the effects of process variables (melt T, heating and cooling rates) on the microstructure in PIT samples. We will discuss the choice of precursor powder, composition of 1223 and heating schedule which gives the best properties in small coils.

MODIFICATION OF Bi-2223 PRECURSORS BY POWDER ENGINEERING METHODS:</B> <I>O.A. Shlyakhtin</I>, A.L. Vinokurov, V.V. Ischenko, N.N. Oleinikov, Dept. of Chemistry, Moscow State University, 119899 Moscow, Russia
<P>
Reactivity of Bi-2223 precursors is rather sensitive to the microstructure of the last ones, i.e., to the size of 2212 particles and spatial distribution of minor phases. The primary way to change precursor microstructure is connected with the change of precursor synthesis technique. Relying on our studies of particle size evolution during synthesis and thermal treatment of oxide powders, we propose a method of fine and directed modification of precursor microstructure in frames of the same synthesis technique. This method is based on the mechanical and ultrasonic treatment of precursor powders at the intermediate stages of their synthesis by chemical methods.

<P>
This talk will review some of the processing techniques adaptable to high-Tc superconductor fabrication with much emphasis on desirable geometries, improved properties, microstructure control, and its associated practical problems that result in its good performance in magnetic fields. It has been observed that the improvement and optimization of Jc is hindered by the formation of jospehson weak links at grain boundaries, flux creep/flux flow effects, and anisotropic properties in polycrystalline high-Tc superconducting materials. Although the oxide superconductors in polycrystalline form have very poor in-field Jc, it can be improved by studying the current flow. The inhomo geneous current flow in these materials is discussed with the help of results for laser slicing and magnetooptic imaging experiments. Lastly, the advanced applications of each are discussed.

The aluminum-based intermetallic compounds are the subject of growing interest for their combination of properties such as low density, good resistance to corrosion and heat, etc. For the Al-transition metal alloys, we may mention that the addition of rare earths to Al-rich alloys can bring about a significant modification of macro- and microstructure resulting in improvement in strength, thermal stability, etc. Several applications of selected Al-M-R (M-transition metal) alloys for their typical characteristics such as magnetic properties and hydrogen storage capability may be worthy of note. The knowledge of their thermodynamic properties may therefore be useful in gaining information on stable and metastable phases of these systems. To this end, we have begun a systematic study on the reactivity of the Al-R and Al-Ni-R alloys using calorimetric techniques, x-ray diffraction and microscopy analyses. The results so far obtained for selected Al-Ni-R alloy compositions will be illustrated and discussed.

The Hoch-Arsphofen model has been applied to binary, ternary and higher order metallic, ceramic systems, aqueous solutions, polymer blends and used for phase diagram calculations. The model is an expansion of the regular solution model: it assumes that in a binary system the A-B bond properties depend on the surroundings. The model was derived from ternary and quaternary systems, and no ternary or higher order interaction parameters are needed. An equation for Cp(L-s) has been developed, based on Tg, the theoretical glass transition temperature, where, below the melting point, the entropy of the liquid equals that of the solid, and the Gibbs energy difference G(L-s) is a maximum.

<P>
The deviations of the thermo-physical functions from the additive rule of mixing as a function of concentration, temperature and pressure is a key to the understanding of the energetics of alloy formation. Within the framework of statistical thermodynamic model, a suitable link is established between the bulk observable properties and the nature of atomic interactions in strongly and weakly correlated systems. It helps to analyze the role of enthalpic and entropic effects on alloy formation. The implications of basic interactions (i.e. electron-electron, ion-ion and electron-ion) on formation energy are also discussed from electronic theory. Pairwise interactions calculated from the first principle theory are found to have a direct correspondence to the order energy which occurs as a free parameter in various thermodynamic models.

<P>
The optimum conditions for synthesizing potassium hexatitanate whiskers (hereinafter called as PHW) were systematically examined using fast-cooling melt method. The intermediate and final products were determined by x-ray diffraction analysis, SEM and differential thermal analysis. A synthetic mechanism of PHW by melt method was proposed. The physical properties of obtained PHW were measured. A ratio of whisker length to whisker diameter is preferably 50 to 200. A PVC resinous composition containing 10-30% of obtained PHW is believed to show that the mechanical properties, heat resistance and abrasion resistance are much improved. For example, the tensile strength is 1.9 times larger than that of PVC resinous matrix and thermal deforming temperature is raised from 84&#176;C to 120&#176;C.

The starting materials consisted of TiO2, C, an Ni-catalyst, and NaCl used as precursor for Cl. The synthesis of TiC whiskers are made in an Ar (g) atmosphere while the Ti(N1-xCx) whiskers are prepared in N2 (g) which besides preventing oxidation also acts as nitrogen source for the whiskers. The main impurities in the whisker product are minor amounts of unreacted carbon, oxygen and remnants of the Ni-catalyst. The VLS-mechanism is complex and involve formation of gaseous TiClx species, which are transported to the catalyst. However, the overall reaction is a straightforward carbothermal reduction/nitridation reaction.

RECEPTION OF CERAMIC FIBERS FROM JOINTLY PRECIPITATED HYDROXIDES: </B><I>Maximilian N. Kopylovich</I>, Alexey K. Baev, and Alexander A. Chernik. Department of Analytical Chemistry, Byelorussian State Technological University, 13a Sverdlov Street, Minsk, 220630 Republic of Belarus
<P>
The coprecipitation method is perspective for reception of ceramic fibers. The essence of the method consists of a joint precipitation of hydroxides or salts with the subsequent branch, washing, drying and heating of a precipitate. The joint precipitation of hydroxides has a number of features. The hydroxides of metals can interact at the moment of a joint precipitation that results in occurrence of solid solutions. It was proven that in many systems containing by 2 and more hydrolyzed metal ions under certain conditions the formation of heteronuclear hydroxocomplexes occurs in solutions. The further interaction of specified hydroxopolymers causes formation of complex polynuclear structures reach the size of colloidal particles. The latters are X-ray amorphous and they are a prestructure of the future material. Such prestructure can be transformed into a final crystal product at lower temperature and smaller duration of heat treatment in comparison with oxide technology accepted in manufacture of ceramic fibers at present. It will allow to expand a palette of ceramic fibers and to lower their cost price.

MEASUREMENT AND MONITORING OF AIRBORNE PARTICLES--TECHNIQUES AND REGULATIONS: </B><I>Martin Harper, PhD,</I> SKC, Inc., 863 Valley View Road, Eighty Four, PA 15330
<P>
Measurement of the nature and number of suspended particles in breathing air is used in health effect studies and to demonstrate compliance with government (OSHA, MSHA, EPA) regulations. The characteristics of the aerosol (e.g. fibrous, biological, metaliferous) and the requirements of the regulations govern the choice of technique. Three health-based size distributions are recognized (inhalable, thoracic, and respirable), but the definition of the fractions has varied over time. Current size separation and sampling equipment for aerosols includes impingers, elutriators, filters, impactors, cyclones, and various direct-reading instruments based on, for example, light scattering, or particle motions. Factors which influence the choice include sensitivity, accuracy, portability and ease of use, calibration requirements, cost, and government regulations. Some instruments are well matched to the health-based size fractions, and others less so. The history and current state of regulations will be reviewed, and the types of instruments will be described.

<P>
The processing, manufacture and handling of powdered metals can employ widely varying process conditions which affect the potential for ignition, the explosion output and resultant collateral damages. This paper presents an overview of the factors (i.e., particle size distribution, particle cloud density, degree of turbulence, oxygen content and ambient temperature) which impact the minimum ignition energy requirement and explosive output of metallic powders. Processing conditions which strongly affect the output of an explosion, as measured in terms of maximum pressure achieved and maximum rate of pressure rise, are presented. Parameters influencing the energy requirements for ignition of an explosion will be emphasized. Dust cloud characterization under controlled conditions can be utilized to predict and, when necessary, to minimize powdered metal processing hazards.

<P>
Although only a small percentage of the general population and work force will face exposure to airborne beryllium, the effects of this exposure to the individual can be permanent and devastating. One effect, chronic beryllium disease (CBD), a granuloma and fibrotic lung disease with latency, can be developed after inhalation exposures to beryllium. In this study, the principal investigators conducted a hazard characterization of the beryllium powder plasma spray operation at Los Alamos National Laboratory using side-by-side, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) sampling with conventional industrial hygiene techniques. We used results of the sampling data to reevaluate work practices and engineering controls associated with the plasma spray operation. As a consequence, work practices have changed, and new engineering controls and facility design changes will be implemented. These revised engineering controls include modifications to the beryllium spray chamber and design of auxiliary equipment used during routine spray chamber maintenance.

JOINING AND FABRICATING RHENIUM USING EXPLOSIVE METAL WORKING TECHNIQUES:</B> Donald J. Butler, Sr. Project Engineer, Northwest Technical Industries, Inc., 2249 Diamond Point Road, Sequim, WA 98382
<P>
Rhenium has many unique and interesting properties, but some of those same properties make Rhenium difficult to fabricate and weld. Explosive metal working also has some interesting capabilities. Northwest Technical Industries, under contract from the NASA Lewis Research Center, has been successful using the explosive welding technique to join Rhenium to metals such as Tantalum, Molybdenum, TZM Molybdenum, Vanadium and C 103 Niobium. This paper will describe the explosive welding process and present the results of the work that has been completed with Rhenium. Also, this paper will describe how explosives can be used to form metal parts and explore the potential of using explosive metal forming techniques with Rhenium.

STATE OF THE ART FABRICATION PROCESSES FOR IRIDIUM/RHENIUM THRUST CHAMBERS:</B> <I>R. Tuffias</I>, Ultramet, 12173 Montague St., Pacoima, CA 91331
<P>
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been used to fabricate rhenium liquid rocket combustion chambers since 1977. CVD iridium was first applied to rhenium chambers for high temperature oxidation protection in 1984. Since that time, CVD iridium/rhenium (Ir/Re) chambers have been successfully hot-fire tested at various facilities in both nitrogen tetroxide/monomethyl hydrazine (NTO/MMH) and oxygen/hydrogen (O2/H2) bipropellants, at mixture ratios ranging from 4 to 17, for a total of nearly 200 hours. An alternate processing method is to form the rhenium by powder metallurgy and apply the iridium by electroplating. Hot-fire testing of this processing method to date includes 43 seconds in NTO/MMH and approximately 11 hours in O2/H2 at a mixture ratio of about 3, an oxidizing potential that may actually be benign to unprotected rhenium. This paper will discuss alternate processing methods and their relationship to fabricating Ir/Re combustion chambers, as well as test methods for evaluating their efficacy.

DEVELOPMENT OF BONDED RHENIUM/Nb-1%Zr TUBING FOR THE SP-100 SPACE NUCLEAR REACTOR</B>: Michael Kangilaski, Advanced Methods and Materials, 1798 Technology Drive, #251, San Jose, CA 95110; E.D. Sayre (retired); D.C. Wadekamper, T.J. Ruffo, General Electric Company, San Jose, CA
<P>
The SP-100 Space Nuclear Reactor design required a rhenium barrier between the uranium nitride nuclear fuel and the niobium alloy cladding. For higher strength and thermal performance it was deemed desirable to metallurgically bond the rhenium tube to the Nb-1%Zr tube. The bonding was achieved by brazing both ends of the rhenium and Nb-1%Zr tubes with a special braze adapter and then hot isostatically pressing (HIP) the brazed assembly. A considerable amount of effort went into developing a two stage HIP cycle for the bonding. A relatively low pressure was chosen in the first stage to assure that the weaker Nb-1%Zr tube collapsed uniformly onto the rhenium tube without any deformation occurring in the stronger rhenium tube. Avoidance of deformation in the rhenium was necessary because rhenium has low ductility at the HIP'ing temperature of 1350&#176;C. In the second stage the temperature and pressure were increased to assure metallurgical bonding of the rhenium and Nb-1%Zr tube.

<P>
Directed Light Fabrication (DLF) is a direct metal deposition process that fuses powder, delivered by gas into the focal zone of a high powered laser beam to form fully dense nearnet shaped components. This is accomplished in one step without the use of molds, dies, forming, pressing, sintering or forging equipment. DLF is performed in a high purity inert environment free from the contaminants associated with conventional processing such as oxide and carbon pickup, lubricants, binding agents, cooling or cleaning agents. Applications using rhenium have historically been limited in part by its workability and cost. This study demonstrates the ability to fuse rhenium metal powder, using a DLF machine, into free standing rods and describes the associated parameter study. Microstructural comparisons between DLF deposited rhenium and commercial rhenium sheet product is performed. This research combined with existing DLF technology demonstrates the feasibility of forming complex rhenium metal shapes directly from powder.

<P>
Pushed by extreme aerospace requirements, exotic materials with unusual properties are being pressed into service. One such material is rhenium. With a density of 21 g/cm3, it is an unlikely material for structural applications, but with an ultimate strength of 20,000 psi at 2000&#176;C, it is the strongest metal at this temperature and comparable in strength to carbon composites up to 2500&#176;C. In order to design structural parts, it is necessary to be able to model their load/ deflection relationship. Such analysis typically assumes that the material is elastic and conforms to Hooke's Law (stress being linearly proportional to strain). When the material becomes inelastic or plastic, failure is assumed to occur, since a permanent deformation takes place This limit is referred to as the yield strength. Typical yield strengths for engineering materials such as steel are roughly 60-80% of the material's ultimate strength. For these materials, then, a linear analysis permits a design range up to 60-80% of the ultimate capability of the material. As long as the material is operated in this range, the relationship between stress and strain remains constant. Rhenium, on the other hand exhibits a &quot;classical yield strength&quot; that can be as low as 10% of its ultimate strength, and its stress-strain relationship varies based on its previous stress history. If a structural design is based on this classical yield strength, 90% of the capability of the material is effectively discarded. Room temperature yield strength data for CVD (chemically vapor deposited) rhenium have included values as high as 45,000 psi and as low as 8,000 psi. Rocket engine designers are currently in a quandary as to the meaning of this data and how to use it to design components. This paper will discuss some of the strength data and present alternatives.

MATERIALS PROPERTY TEST RESULTS OF RHENIUM:</B> <I>Melvin L. Chazen</I>, TRW Space &amp; Technology Division, One Space Park, Bldg. 01-1050, Redondo Beach, CA 90278
<P>
The use of rhenium as a material of construction for high performance liquid apogee/ perigee or delta-V engine applications is very beneficial as the engine performance is less limited by operating wall temperatures due to the performance. Rhenium has a very high melting point (&gt;5700F) but does require protection from oxidation from the products of combustion. Iridium has been demonstrated as a successful high temperature protective coating (melting point &gt;4400P). There are two methods of producing rhenium thrust chambers for high performance engines which have been successfully demonstrated which are chemical vapor deposition of iridium lined rhenium and powder metallurgy rhenium coated with iridium. An investigation was conducted to determine the material properties of both CVD and PM rhenium which was sponsored by NASA-LeRC on the SSRT program. Material property tests consisted of tensile, ultimate, modulus and low cycle fatigue at room temperature, 1500F and 25OOF with a minimum number of tensile tests at 2700-3500F and high temperature creep at 3000F This paper presents these results which indicate that both CVD and FM rhenium are usable for flight engines. In addition a summary of the results of engine tests with experimental PM rhenium will be presented.

CREEP BEHAVIOR OF ALUMINUM STRENGHENING WITH VERY HIGH VOLUME FRACTIONS OF SUBMICRON ALUMINA PARTICLES:</B> <I>C. Verdon</I>, D.C. Dunand, Department of Materials Sciences and Engineering, Room- 8-328, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139
<P>
High-temperature mechanical properties of dispersion strengthened cast aluminum containing 0.3 &#181;m alumina particles were investigated. Compression creep tests were performed on samples containing three different volume fractions of oxide dispersoids, i.e. 25%, 33% and 43%, in the temperature range between 450&#176;C and 600&#176;C. Both as-cast materials, whose grain size in the range of centimeter, and extruded materials, which exhibit submicron grains, were tested. In the coarse-grained materials, the deformation is controlled by dislocation creep, whereas the deformation of the finegrained materials is controlled either by diffusional creep or by dislocation creep, depending on temperature and stress. The high values of the apparent stress exponents and of the apparent activation energy indicate a threshold stress for both creep regimes. Experimental results are discussed with respect to existing dispersion strengthening models.

<P>
The aerospace industry uses several types of Al-based composite materials. The main criteria for their application are light weight, high strength and hardness, low CTE, and high dimensional stability (capability to keep dimensions unchanged under thermal load). Theoretical formulas were developed to calculate the CTE of binary composites, as well as the ideal diameter of the strengthening particles for composites working under stringent physical engineering conditions. The calculations which were performed permitted to select the volume fraction and the dimension of the reinforcing particles which offer the most potential. Based on these calculations, composites containing 40% of reinforcing particles were selected and produced using the Vacuum Plasma Spraying (VPS) method. The VPS netshape forming of composites was shown to possess distinct advantages over conventional manufacturing processes. The VPS technique can be used to fabricate advanced composites with complex shapes, high density (9798% of the theoretical density) and, uniform particles distribution of various ceramic materials (size and composition). Plastic deformation and heat treatment result in further density improvement, which in turn significantly improves the mechanical properties of the composites.

MICROSTRUCTURES AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF DIE CAST SiCp/Al COMPOSITES:</B> Tae-Won Lee, Jun-Ho Seo, Chi-Hwan Lee, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, Inha University, Inchon, Korea
<P>
This study was focused to investigate the effect of die casting parameters on the microstructure and mechanical properties of SiCp (10 and 20 vol%)/Al composites. Die casting was performed using the mold preheated at 130&#176;C under the pressure of 916 kg/m3 and pouring temperature of 650~700&#176;C. In this work, twostage injection system, which was composed of slow and high speed injections, was used to prevent the input of air during injection. The speeds of slow and high speed injections were 0.3~0.6 and 1.4 m/s, respectively. It was found that the SiC particles were homogeneously distributed in refined Al matrix. This results from the rapid mixing of Al and SiC particles during injection and the low segregation due to fast solidification rate. These microstructures provided good roomtemperature mechanical properties.

FABRICATION AND TENSILE PROPERTIES OF SiCP/AZ91 Mg COMPOSITES BY HOT EXTRUSION</B>: Doo-Myun Lee, Chi-Hwan Lee, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, Inha University, Inchon, Korea

The tensile properties and microstructural evolution of hot-extruded SiCp/AZ91 Mg matrix composites have been investigated as functions of extrusion parameters and SiC particulate size. Also, the effect of SiC particulates on. the grain size of matrix in the composites was studied. The AZ91 Mg alloy powders prepared by wet attrition milling from Mg machined chips were hotpressed with and without SiC particulates, hot-extruded and then solutiontreated. The microstructural observation revealed that both the composites and Mg alloy have equiaxed grains due to the dynamic recrystallization during hot extrusion. The tensile strength of the both alloys increased with increasing extrusion ratio, and the strength of the composites were higher than that of the Mg alloy without reinforcement. It was found that the tensile strength of the both materials decreased after solutiontreatment; the decrease in tensile strength of the composites was considerably smaller than that of the Mg alloy. The grain growth of the matrix in the composites was inhibited by the introduction of the SiC particulates, resulting in the improvement in the yield strength of the composites.

The titaniumbased particulates composites are known to exhibit superior physical and mechanical properties compared to the unreinforced alloy. In cases where TiB<I> </I>or TiC is used as the reinforcing particulates, it has been reported that the fatigue fracture originates neither from the interior of particulate nor from the particulate/matrix interface, put rather from the matrix. Therefore it is suggested that the high cycle fatigue strength of the composite is strongly dependent on the matrix microstructure. In the present work, the effect of the matrix microstructure on the high cycle fatigue strength was studied for blended elemental P/M Ti6Al2Sn4Zr2Mo/lOTiB and Ti6Al1.7feO.lSi/10 TiB composites. It was found that the composites with a fine acicular <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> two-phase microstructure showed an improved high cycle fatigue strength over those for conventionally processed composites with colony matrix microstructure.

INFLUENCE OF FIBRE STRENGTH DISTRIBUTION ON THE FATIGUE BEHAVIOUR OF A TiB2 Is/SCS-6 COMPOSITE:</B> J. Liu, J.G. Pursell, P. Bowen, IRC for High Performance Materials/School of Metallurgy and Materials, The University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B 15 2TT, UK
<P>
The fatigue behaviour of silicon carbide fibre reinforced titanium matrix composites (TMCs) has been the subject of numerous studies. Bridging is found to he the dominant mechanism leading to the decrease in the crack growth rate us the fatigue crack grows. However, once the bridging fibres fail, the benefit of bridging will diminish. The influence of statistical fibre strength distribution on matrix cracking in fibre composites has been modeled by assuming the strength of the fibres falls in a twoparameter Weibull distribution. However, recent studies have shown that the fibre strength in TMCs is bimodal. The aim of this paper is to study the effects of fibre strength, and especially of those fibres with lower Weibull modulus. on the fatigue behaviour of a Ti,321s/SCS6 composite. First, single fibre tensile tests were conducted to evaluate the fibre strength distribution in both asreceived uncl fatigued specimens. The fracture surfaces of the fibres showing different strengths were examined using a SEM to distinguish lowstrength fibres fractographically. Fatigue tests were also conducted on single edge notched specimens. Different maximum loads and notch sizes were employed so that different fibre stresses were obtained. Acoustic emission, and direct current potential drop techniques were used to detect fibre failure and to monitor the crack growth. respectively. After the fatigue tests, the percentage of lowstrength fibres in the specimens was again estimated fractographically. The influence of fibre distribution was also modeled by characterizing the fibre strengths using two twoparameter Weibull distributions. The results show that the percentage of the lowstrength fibres plays an important role in determining the fatigue behaviour of the composite. Under identical loading condition, specimens with more lowstrength fibres are. of cause, more likely to fail. and this has been quantified.

LIFE PREDICTION BASED ON CRACK GROWTH BEHAVIOR FOR GAS TURBINE NOZZLES:</B><I> N. Isobe</I>, S. Sakurai Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory, Hitachi Ltd., Japan; K. Kumada, Hitachi Works, Hitachi Ltd., Japan
<P>
Life prediction method for gas turbine nozzles was discussed. In gas turbine nozzles, crackings due to cyclic thermal strain generating with start-up and shut-down of turbines limit the life of components. This thermal strain is usually compression and holded during steady operation time. Therefore, it will be necessary to consider the effect of compressive creep or relaxation to the evaluation of crack growth behavior in nozzles. We conducted crack growth tests at 900&#176;C using a strain wave form including compressive strain hold. Test results showed that crack growth rate in compressive strain hold tests were faster than that in no strain hold tests. A fracture mechanics approach was carried out to evaluate this compression hold effects. By using creep J-integral, a good correlation for crack growth data was obtained. A crack growth analysis considering stress gradient in the component was also carried out and we discussed about its accuracy using inspection data for 25MW class gas turbine nozzles.

NON-DESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION OF HIGH TEMPERATURE OXIDATION DAMAGE USING ELECTROCHEMICAL TECHNIQUES: </B><I>D.C. Tamboli</I>, A.K. Rawat, V. Desai, Mechanical Materials and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL 32816
<P>
Electrochemical techniques have been widely used as life prediction tools in corroding structures and coatings for aqueous corrosion. However, there has not been much attention given to the applicability of these techniques in assessing high temperature oxidation damage. In the high temperature oxidation, the metallic substrate is covered with an oxide film which has semiconducting properties. Electrochemical techniques such as electrochemical polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveal vital information about the electronic transport properties of this oxide film by monitoring the response of the system to applied D. C. and A. C. potentials respectively. The protective properties of an oxide are largely dependent on the electronic and ionic transport through the oxide layer. In the ex-situ studies, the oxidized specimens are immersed in a highly reversible redox electrolyte. The parameters such as polarization resistance, open circuit potential changes and the oxide band gap potential obtained using these techniques showed good qualitative corroboration with the observed oxidation damage in the alloys studied.

PREDICTIONS OF MICROSTRUCTURE CHANGES IN COATED TURBINE BLADES DURING SERVICE: </B><I>X. Qiao</I>, J.E. Morral, Department of Metallurgy and Materials Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269-3136
<P>
With DICTRA software, it is possible to predict microstructural changes in coated turbine blades during service. In the present work, this technique is illustrated by calculating the microstructures that will form between a nickel base <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">1 alloy and MCrALY type <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> alloys. It is shown that a number of different microstructures can form initially, depending on the coating composition. As the average composition of the coating varies during service, the microstructure may change several times. These variations can be illustrated on an &quot;Interdiffusion Microstructure Map.&quot;

EFFECTS OF SUBSTRATE CURVATURE AND ROUGHNESS ON RESIDUAL STRESSES IN OXIDE FILMS:</B> <I>J.K. Wright, </I>R.L. Williamson, Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, P.O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-2218
<P>
Finite element simulations are used to examine residual thermal stresses and strains in protective Al2O3 scales on Fe3Al specimens, both during cooling from oxide formation temperatures and during subsequent thermal cycling. Geometrically, the simulations focus on regions of local curvature, either due to corners or substrate surface roughness. A variety of substrate corner radii and film thicknesses are considered. The effects of substrate material behavior are investigated by not only considering the actual elastic-plastic response of the aluminide substrate, but also the limiting cases of purely elastic and perfectly plastic material behavior. When plasticity is permitted, the substrate is able to deform to accommodate stresses at the corner, and the film is in tension along the outside surface and compression near the interface. These tensile stresses are of concern for coating integrity, since corners are observed experimentally to be sites of oxide cracks and spallation.

<P>
Weld repair of ASTM A-470 class 8 high pressure steam turbine rotor steel has been performed to extend the service life of older fossil units. Multipass SAW, MIG and TIG welding have been employed. Microhardness of the base metal was VHN 253, however it dropped to VHN 227 at the heat affected zone close to unaffected base metal for SAW. This area of hardness drop is called &quot;softening zone&quot; and has a width of 0.5~0.6mm. During creep rupture test, failure occurred around the softening zone and rupture time was 772.4hr at 19ksi and 593&#176;C. At ruptured area, spherical types of coarsened carbides, which were revealed molybdenum rich M6C were observed. Based on creep rupture life, SAW and/or high heat input TIG process provide the best creep rupture life and it could operate about 8-10 years.

<P>
Mathematical models of vapor and melt pool transport phenomena in electron beam evaporation are used to design an optimal beam scanning pattern to achieve a desired evaporant flux distribution at the substrate. The vapor transport model uses the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method to calculate evaporant flux distribution at the substrate from the temperature distribution at the source, the activities of source species, background gases and system geometry. The source temperature distribution is adjusted manually in order to produce the desired flux distribution at the substrate. The melt pool model then calculates the heat flux distribution which the scanning electron beam must impart to the molten source surface in order to produce the desired temperature distribution, accounting for thermal losses to radiation and evaporation. Finally, a surface heat transfer model is used to calculate minimum beam local heating by the scanning beam.

LIQUID METAL COMPATIBILITY OF STRUCTURAL MATERIALS WITH LIQUID LEAD-BISMUTH AND MERCURY: </B> J.R. Weeks, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973-5000
<P>
Both liquid mercury and liquid lead-bismuth eutectic have been proposed as possible target materials for spallation neutron sources. During the 1950's and 1960's a substantial program existed at Brookhaven National Laboratory as part of the Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor program on the compatibility of bismuth, lead, and their alloys with structural materials. Subsequently, compatibility investigations of mercury with structural materials were performed in support of the development of Rankine-cycle mercury turbines for nuclear applications. The present talk will review our understanding of the corrosion/mass-transfer reactions of structural materials with these liquid-metal coolants. Topics to be discussed include the basic solubility relationships of iron, chromium, nickel, and refractory metals in these liquid metals, the results of inhibition studies, the role of oxygen on the corrosion processes, and specialized topics such as cavitation corrosion and liquid-metal embrittlement. Emphasis will be placed on utilizing the understanding gained in this earlier work in the development of heavy-liquid-metal targets for spallation neutron sources.

MODELING AND OPTICAL STUDIES OF THE WATER-METAL INTERFACE IN SPALLATION NEUTRON SOURCE TARGETS: </B><I>L.L. Daemen</I>, G.J. Kanner, R.S. Lillard, D.P. Butt, T.O. Brun, W.F. Sommer, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
In spallation neutron sources neutrons are produced when a beam of high-energy particles (e.g., 1 GeV protons) collides with a (water-cooled) heavy metal target such as tungsten. The resulting spallation reactions produce a complex radiation environment (which differs from typical conditions at fission and fusion reactors) leading to the radiolysis of water molecules. Most water radiolysis products are short-lived but extremely reactive. When formed in the vicinity of the target surface they can react with metal atoms, thereby contributing to target corrosion. We will describe the results of calculations and experiments performed at Los Alamos to determine the impact on target corrosion of water radiolysis in the spallation radiation environment. Our computational methodology relies on the use of the Los Alamos radiation transport code, LAHET, to determine the radiation environment, and the AEA code, FACSIMILE, to model reaction-diffusion processes. The experiments make use of ultra-fast Raman spectroscopic techniques. Laser Raman spectroscopy enables us to identify the chemical species formed in water and at a metal surface during irradiation, as well as to observe the growth of corrosion products at the water-metal interface.

Radiation enhanced, aqueous corrosion of solid spallation-neutron-source targets, such as tungsten, or target cladding or structural materials, such as superalloys and stainless steels, is a significant concern in accelerator-driven transmutation technologies. In this paper we describe methods for control and <I>in situ </I>monitoring of corrosion in accelerator cooling water loops. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we have measured the corrosion rates of aluminum 6061, copper, Inconel 718, and 304L stainless steel in the flow loop of a water target irradiated by a milliamp, 800 MeV proton beam. We also briefly describe our second generation experiments, scheduled to begin in early 1997. In these experiments we will measure the corrosion rates of tungsten, tantalum, Inconel 718, aluminum 5053, and 316L, 304L, and HT-9 stainless steel. We also discuss our laser diagnostic techniques for directly observing the production of corrosive radiolysis products as well as corrosion products near the surface of target materials.

<P>
Mercury corrosion will be one of the critical problems for a spallation neutron source using Hg as target material. Preliminary results of static corrosion tests on 316L austenitic steel and on MANET and F82H martensitic/ferritic steels will be presented. Smooth and notched C-ring-shaped specimens were prestressed before putting them into Hg. The tests were performed at 300C and interrupted after different durations. After cooling down to room temperature, the change of morphology of specimen surfaces was examined. For 316L specimens after 160 hrs of corrosion, Hg covered all surfaces. However, for F82H and MANET, there was almost no Hg on surfaces after 500 hrs, but surfaces were covered with Hg after an additional 500 hrs. F82H had the thickest oxide layer (about 0.5 &#181;m thick after 1000 hours), MANET was next, and 316L had the thinnest oxide layer. The mechanisms for wetting and oxidation will be discussed.

SURFACE OXIDES AND THE BEHAVIOR OF ALUMINUM COMPONENTS IN THE APT TARGET/BLANKET SYSTEM:</B> <I>M.R. Louthan, Jr</I>., Savannah River Technology Center, Aiken, SC 29808
<P>
The mechanical properties of the aluminum alloys in the accelerator production of tritium (APT) target/blanket system are sensitive to exposure and processing history. Several of the APT applications require exposure to flowing, hot water under heat transfer conditions. The thermal conductivity of the protective film is low and limits the temperature drop across the aluminum. This reduction in heat transfer will raise metal-oxide interface temperature and play a major role in the corrosion processes. Under heat transfer conditions, the oxide-metal interface temperature will increase both oxide thicknesses and service temperatures for aluminum. Interrelationships among service, oxide development and water chemistry are similar to those for reactor service and this paper relates anticipated performance in the APT system to reactor experience.

Feedstock powders of metals, alloys and ceramics for thermal spray applications have to meet several specifications. Particle shape, size and distribution, powder flow characteristics and density are the important factors that need to be controlled, in order to ensure high spray efficiency and better coating properties. Thermal plasma technology can be effectively utilized to produce metal, alloy and ceramic powders for spray applications. The present paper describes plasma spheroidisation of commercially available aluminum powder and nickel-aluminum powder blend in a plasma reactor. Results show that the processed powder particles bear spherical morphology with excellent flow characteristics, ideal for thermal spray applications.

For some electronic applications where a dispersed electrically-conductive particulate phase is employed, the conductivity of the surface (or near-surface region) of the particles provides for the primary mechanism which determines its electrical conductivity. Particles of a less expensive material, which may have desirable thermal-expansion properties, when coated with silver offer a means of also obtaining desirable electrical properties at a lower cost. The research conducted was focused primarily on the development of silver-coated tungsten particles for thick-film polymeric conductors. The ammoniacal electrolyte was formulated from silver-nitrate, glycine inhibitor and formaldehyde reductant. The reduction, and subsequent deposition, of silver occurred selectively on the surface of the tungsten particles. Coated particles were assessed by SEM imaging. The thickness of the silver coating was estimated to be approximately 100nm on the basis of a mass account and the coating being uniform. The electrical conductivity of a silver-coated tungsten-powder pellet was found to be similar to that of a silver-powder pellet, of identical geometry.

The slag line in vacuum oxygen decarburization (VOD) ladles is a severe environment for refractory materials during the refining of stainless, steels. Magnesia-chrome bricks are currently the refractory materials of choice for this application. The actual performance of a fixed quality of magnesia-chrome bricks is however largely dependent on the conditions during the VOD process cycle. This presentation addresses the aspects of chemical interaction between the slag phase and the magnesia-chrome refractory materials. As-delivered and postmortem bricks have been analyzed by optical microscopy, x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Different phenomena were observed such as slag penetration and oxide reduction. These experimental observations are the basis for a modeling of the slag/magnesia-chrome reaction. The aim is to investigate alternate, viable VOD processing routes which are less demanding on the refractory materials<I>.</I>

The goal of this study was to investigate the reduction of MnO pellets by carbon saturated liquid iron. The effects of the initial Mn and Si content in the bath were explored. The tests were performed in laboratory apparatus, where MnO pellets reacted with a saturated liquid iron bath. The reduction time was taken by measurement of the CO pressure variation with the time. The results showed the effect of initial Mn, C and Si content in the bath. The Kinetics of MnO reduction increases with the decrease in the initial MnO content in the bath. Si in the bath increases the reduction rate of the MnO pellets.

CREEP DEFORMATION AND RUPTURE OF Al2O3 UNDER STATIC AND CYCLIC LOADING</B>: Darrell Socie, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801
<P>
Results of the tension and torsion tests on a commercial grade of vitreous bonded, 99.8% Al2O3, show that creep deformation is enhanced significantly under shear stress. Microstructural observations show that extensive grain boundary sliding occurs in the torsion specimens and gives rise to a large initial creep deformation. Evidence of cavity formation is found throughout the specimen. Little evidence of grain boundary sliding or cavitation was found in the tensile specimen even though the tensile stress was four times larger. The combined action of one tensile stress <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/sigma.gif">1 and one compressive stress, -<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/sigma.gif">3, doubles the grain boundary shear stresses to 2<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/tau.gif">. This results in more grain boundary sliding and early cavity formation under shear loading. In addition the compressive stress will cause a wedging action on individual grains that will result in a grain facet stress of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/sigma.gif">n. This stress will be added to the tensile stress, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/sigma.gif">1 , to enhance cavity coalescence and microcrack growth.

<P>
The mechanical properties of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) can be controlled by tailoring the fiber/matrix interface, especially the type of interfacial materials and their thickness. A new Nicalon/SiC composite with SiC as an interfacial coating processed by a forced-flow chemical vapor infiltration (FCVI) method at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory demonstrates improved high-temperature oxidation resistance than that with a carbon interfacial coating. However, it is difficult to differentiate the SiC interface from the matrix using scanning electron micrographs, because of nearly identical microstructures and similar chemical compositions of the fiber, the matrix, and the interfacial coating. In this paper, the line-scan chemical analysis technique in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to investigate the SiC interfacial coating. As-received and oxidized specimens are studied. The existence of elements, such as Si, C, O, and Cl, and their distributions along the fiber/matrix interface, are detected. The profile of interface chemical composition can be used to identify interface structure as well as thickness. The effect of interface composition on mechanical properties is also studied.

CRACK NUCLEATION ON ELASTIC POLYCRYSTAL SURFACE IN CORROSIVE ENVIRONMENT:</B> Z. Suo, H. Yu, Mechanical and Environmental Engineering Department, Materials Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106

This paper analyzes a process of crack nucleation on the surface of a ceramic subject to a stress parallel to the surface, in an environment where the ceramic evaporates slowly and deforms elastically. Both grain boundary tension and elastic stress concentration cause the surface to groove along its intersections with the grain boundaries. Two behaviors are identified. If the applied stress is small, the grooves approach an invariant shape, and the ceramic erodes by gross mass loss. If the applied stress is large, the grooves sharpen into crack fronts, and the ceramic breaks by decohesion. The models relate crack nucleation threshold and time to the applied stress, surface and grain boundary tensions, chemical free energy, grain size, and kinetic parameters. Surface self-diffusion is also included in the analysis.

ROLE OF GRAIN BOUNDARY PHASE DURING HIGH-TEMPERATURE FATIGUE-CRACK GROWTH IN CERAMICS:</B> J. K. Shang, D. Yao, C. Huang, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801
<P>
Role of grain boundary phase on high-temperature fatigue-crack growth were examined in a TiB2/SiC composite and polycrystalline aluminas of different purities at 800-1100&#176;C. The low-purity alumina and the composite contained a continuous film of glassy phase on the grain boundary while the high-purity aluminas contained either little or no continuous grain boundary phase. In the low-purity alumina and the composite, fatigue crack growth rate increased drastically as the cyclic frequency was decreased. The cyclic crack growth rate was slower that the creep crack growth rate at the same maximum stress intensity. In contrast, fatigue crack growth in the high-purity alumina was relatively insensitive to cyclic frequency and the fatigue crack growth rate was faster than the creep crack growth rate for the same maximum stress intensity. The difference in the fatigue crack growth behavior is explained in terms of the different fatigue crack growth mechanisms in these ceramics.

The mechanical behavior of two Nicalon fabric reinforced ceramic matrix composites, with alumina and silicon carbide as the matrix materials, respectively, were investigated. Four point-bend tests were conducted at ambient and elevated temperatures to study the monotonic and cyclic fatigue behavior. The stress-strain curves were non-linear for both composites, at ambient as well as elevated temperatures. During cyclic loading, the modulus of the composite was monitored to serve as a measure of the loss in load bearing capacity of the composites due to cyclic fatigue loading. Progressive damage in the composites was monitored by optical and electron microscopy techniques. The differences in the composite monotonic and cyclic fatigue behavior, depending on the orientation of the fabric plies to the loading direction, and the micromechanisms responsible for the differences, will be the focus of the paper.

In the electrolysis of neodymium oxide from a molten fluoride electrolyte, anode effects may occur at the carbon anodes, interfering with smooth cell operation. In laboratory experiments, we attempted to circumvent this problem selecting electrolytes with a high oxide concentration, possibly at relatively low rare earth content, but cathodic deposition was not satisfactory. A regime at higher cell voltage was discovered to yield good cell performance, but evolution of considerable amounts of fluorocarbon compounds suggested that a reactive treatment of the off-gases would be necessary for environmental acceptability. Subsequent experimentation at low cell voltage revealed conditions for satisfactory operation without occurrence of anode effects and without any formation of CF4 and C2F6.

Recently, Nd-lean and/or boron-rich melt spun materials have attracted attention as potential materials for bonded magnet applications. Since the alloys can deviate significantly from the stoichiometric Nd2Fe14B composition, additional phases are usually present in the products. The size and volume fraction of these phases play important roles in determining the strength of exchange coupling interaction between phases and, consequently, the magnetic properties obtained. It is of interest to know how the Nd and/or boron contents impact the crystallization behavior and the magnetic properties of these materials.

MODELING OF DUCTILE FRACTURE:</B> <I>Alan Needleman</I>, Division of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912
<P>
Analyses of fracture are discussed where the initial-boundary value problem formulation allows for the possibility of a complete loss of stress carrying capacity, with the associated creation of new free surface. Hence, fracture arises as a natural outcome of the deformation process without any ad hoc failure criterion being employed. The failure mechanisms modeled are plastic void growth and coalescence, and cleavage cracking (so that the ductile-brittle transition can be analyzed). The role of porosity induced weakening in precipitating shear band failures will be illustrated. However, the main emphasis will be on recent predictions of crack growth, including ductile-brittle transitions and three dimensional effects such as shear-lips.

NON-LOCAL EFFECTS IN DUCTILE FRACTURE PREDICTIONS:</B> <I>Viggo Tvergaard</I>, Department of Solid Mechanics, Technical University of Denmark, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark
<P>
Continuum studies of ductile fracture have been based on local constitutive relations, which do not represent a material length scale. The resulting numerical predictions show inherent mesh sensitivity, since the softening material behaviour near final failure will tend to give localized damage in regions as narrow as possible within the mesh resolution. Nonlocal constitutive relations, with the delocalization related to the damage mechanism, have been proposed for ductile fracture where damage involves the nucleation and growth of voids to coalescence. The effect of using this nonlocal material model will be illustrated by a number of analyses, including studies of shear band failure, ductile matrix failure in metal matrix composites, and failure involving two size - scales of voids. Based on recent comparisons with cell - model predictions of localization in a void - sheet the relevant material length scale for a ductile fracture model are discussed.

Ductile rupture behavior is usually characterized with specimens of various types including smooth and notched bars, compact tension specimens, bending bars. In addition, similar specimens geometries of different sizes are also used. Using different specimen geometries allows to investigate the effect of mechanical parameters such as stress triaxility and amount of plastic deformation on ductile rupture. Changing specimen sizes allows to evaluate experimental dispersion and size effects. Considering these effects is of primary importance for the transferability of laboratory tests carried out on relatively small samples to assess the resistance of relatively large industrial components. Both dispersion and size effect are caused by material heterogeneities which have to be accounted for by modeling. This work presents both experimental data and numerical simulation relative to dispersion and size effects on two very different materials. The first one is a plane carbon steel containing MnS inclusions which easily debond from the matrix so that rupture is essentially controlled by void growth. The second material is a cast ferrite - austenite duplex stainless stainless steel. Microcracks are continuously nucleated in the embrittled ferrite so that final rupture is essentially controlled by void nucleation. Both materials were tested using axisymmetric smooth and notched bars and Charpy specimens of different sizes. In order to obtain microstructural data, relevant to modeling, both materials were carefully examined. In the first case, initial local void densities (MnS inclusion content) were measured using image analysis. In the second case, local crack nucleation rates were determined by carrying out interrupted tensile tests and determining crack locations. These examinations are needed to get physically based data to be used in the modeling thus reducing the number of &quot;fitting parameters&quot;. Modeling of rupture, dispersion and size effects can be done using two different approaches both based on finite element analysis. The first one (uncoupled) consists in carrying out simulations of the mechanical response of structures assuming that the material is undamaged. Subsequently, a local rupture criterion is applied to the structure to determine that the material remains unchanged. Subsequently, a local rupture criterion is applied to the structure to determine its failure probability. It is therefore assumed that damage is small enough not to affect the stress strain distribution in the part. In addition the material is supposed to break according to the weakest link theory. The second approach (coupled) is based on continuum damage mechanics using models for ductile metals such as those proposed by Gurson and Rousselier. In this case, the effect of damage evolution on stress distribution in the parts can be fully accounted for. In addition the effect of defect spatial distribution can also be investigated. No specific assumption has to be made on the onset of rupture. Finite element calculations were carried out for both materials using the Gurson-Tvergaard/Rousslier constitutive equations. Initial void volume fractions (first material) or microcrack nucleation rates (second material) were randomly distributed in the structures. Dispersion can be modeled by carrying a Monte Carlo type simulation using the same mesh and different random drawings. Size effect is modeled by keeping the element size constant, thus increasing the number of elements for larger structures. The uncoupled approach was also used for the first approach. Results show that size effect and dispersion can be successfully modeled using both approaches. The fully coupled approach, although more time consuming, is thought to be the most promising since: (1) it is based on fewer assumptions, (2) it can be applied to any geometry (e.g. cracked components); in particular it gives much better results on smooth tensile specimens, (3) it can model the interaction between neighboring heterogeneities clusters.

<P>
In ductile materials, it is typical of many microcracks and pores to nucleate and grow before some of these coalesce to form dominant macrocrack which leads to ultimate failure. This paper is concerned with quantitative identification of the microstructural regions in which this macrocrack nucleation occurs, and the development of constitutive relations for these regions. These microstructure-based constitutive relations can then be used in macromechanical analyses to evaluate potential improvement in macroscopic behavior due to alterations in microstructure.

Microvoid coalescence or MVC fracture depends strongly on microstructure. This applies to each of the constituent processes of MVC, namely nucleation, growth and coalescence of voids, and is true for both transgranular and intergranular MVC. Experimental as well as analytical evidence on this point reveals both needs for further experiments, and gaps in analytical understanding. Methods to vary the behavior of MVC processes, such as variations in temperature, or introduction of hydrogen, convey further information (provided MVC fracture is maintained) and have proven valuable in understanding these processes; of particular value are the notch bend tests, in which stress state can readily be varied to identify control of stress, strain, or a combination of the two.

<P>
A refined mathematical model is presented in this paper to account for the effects of void nucleation, growth and coalescence on fracture initiation and subsequent quasi-static, slow and little crack growth in ductile materials under plane strain and mode I condition. A chain of larger voids uniformly-distributed ahead of the crack tip is used to model the discontinuous fracture process and discontinuous nucleation of small voids at second-phase particles is the main cause for crack initiation in high strength and ductility steels. A cumulative damage criterion, which is the ratio of uncracked length between the crack tip and the first large void to characterize size, is employed. Effects of crack-tip constraint and material parameters on ductile fracture are discussed in terms of the gradient of the variation of crack-tip constraint within the damage zone. Estimation of upper-bound fracture toughness is established and numerical results show that, with the exception of crack growth there is no obvious constraint effect on ductile crack initiation.

DUCTILE CAVITY GROWTH IN NORMALLY BRITTLE MATERIALS:</B> <I>Donald R. Curran</I>, R.E. Tokheim, and T. Cooper, SRI International, 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park, CA 94025
<P>
The term &quot;ductile fracture&quot; can be interpreted in a number of ways, but to a materials scientist who focuses on microscopic mechanisms the meaning is clear: &quot;ductile fracture&quot; means that failure occurs by the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of approximately ellipsoidal microscopic voids in plastically deforming material. To be sure, extremely ductile materials stretched under plane or uniaxial stress conditions may fail in the absence of voids by simple plastic necking. Nonetheless, in most practical engineering applications of failure in ductile materials, microscopic &quot;ductile fracture&quot; play a central role in the failure process. Frank McClintock was one of the pioneers in this area (as well as many others), and his 1968 paper [J. Appl. Mech., <U>35</U>, p.363], along with papers by C.A. Berg [Proc. Fourth U.S. National Congress Appl. Mech. <U>2</U> (1962) 885], J.R. Rice and D.M. Tracy [J. Mech. &amp; Phys. Solids, <U>17</U> (1969) 202], A.L. Gurson [Trans. ASME, J. Eng. Mater. &amp; Technol. (1977) 2], and M.Y. He and J.W. Hutchinson [J. Appl. Mech. <U>48</U> (1981) 830], stimulated much further work. The above papers discussed the conditions for cavity growth in a viscous or plastically deforming material under tension and shear. In the present paper, we take a similar approach, but consider cases in which the cavity growth is driven not only by the externally applied stresses, but also by internal cavity pressure. Such conditions arise when a material is exposed to penetrating radiation from lasers or x-ray sources of sufficient fluence to cause local heterogeneities to vaporize while leaving the matrix material relatively cool. Under such loading conditions, microscopic cavity pressures of several tens of GPa may be produced, sufficient to cause the surrounding matrix material to flow plastically, even when the matrix material is a normally brittle material like a ceramic. Under some boundary conditions, the expanding cavities may drive the matrix material into tension, producing brittle tensile fractures between cavities. We present a computer model of the above processes, and illustrate the model with several example calculations.

Austenitic superalloys can exhibit dramatic reductions in ductility and crack growth resistance when hydrogen triggers a change in failure mode. All failures begin by void growth at fractured matrix carbides. However, void growth is prematurely terminated terminated in hydrogen by second generation void formation at slip band intersections and separation of interconnecting slip band segments. As a first approximation to understanding hydrogen effects on the fracture process, we have combined the Embedded Atom Method with Monte Carlo simulations to model the segregation of hydrogen to dislocation in slip bands and slip band intersections. We will present these results and draw a direct correlation between the segregation of hydrogen to slip band intersections, void formation, and crack growth susceptibility.

NEAR-TIP FRACTURE PROCESSES IN DUCTILE MATERIALS:</B> <I>Kwai S. Chan</I>, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX 78238
<P>
Ductile fracture is generally considered to occur via void nucleation, growth, and coalescence mechanisms that result in a dimpled fracture appearance. For many materials, void initiation and growth take place at hard particles or inclusions. However, ductile fracture involving void formation has been observed in materials that contain neither hard particles nor inclusions. In this paper, the near-tip fracture processes in several structural alloys, including Al-, Ti-, and Nb-base alloys, that exhibit ductile fracture in a variety of microstructures with and without hard particles are summarized. Possible mecha nisms for the formation of dimpled fracture in these materials are identified. These fracture mechanisms are correlated with the microstructures and the fracture resistance curve to provide a basic understanding of the role of microstructure in the crack-tip fracture process, the transition from ductile to brittle fracture, and the source of fracture resistance.

Tungsten heavy alloys (WHA) as well as depleted uranium (DU) alloys (U-0.75% (Ti) for example) have been the primary materials employed in large caliber, U.S. tank ammunition or kinetic energy (KE) penetrators. Since the deformation behaviors and resulting ballistic performance of these alloys are different, there has been considerable effort to develop alternative and more effective penetrator materials. This study involves the mechanical alloying (MA) and PM processing of tungsten-hafnium carbide (1, 2, and 5 weight percent) and W-HfC containing 0.1% lr as a novel approach to WHA development. Slugs of W-1HfC, W-5HfC, and W-2HfC-0.5 lr and W-5HfC-0.5 lr processed from MA powder corresponding to high-speed attritor milling times ranging from 8 to 40 h, have been examined by light metallography and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These products are remarkably free of disclocations and average (bulk) hardness range from 700 VHN for W-1HfC to 1200 VHN for W-5HfC precursor powders milled 16 h. The corresponding W-5HfC-0.5 lr hardness was 1250 VHN, and there were some interesting metallographic differences between the W-5HfC and W-5HfC-0.5 lr.

A new processing methodology is described whereby metal matrices are reinforced in situ by deformation-processing of metal/IMC blends. The IMC &quot;reinforcement&quot; is exemplified by its high strength, attributable to high loadings of dispersed ceramic (e.g. 30-50 v%) within its intermetallic matrix. Processability of the metal/IMC composite is governed by the thermodynamic compatibility of the metal and the intermetallic, and the relative high temperature flow behavior of the metal and the IMC. The methodology will be illustrated through its application to a titanium metal matrix composite, produced by hot extrusion of prealloyed Ti-6Al-4V and IMC (Al3Ti + 40 v% TiB2) powders.

The absence of crystallization over a wide time/temperature window can be utilized to produce bulk metallic glass by relatively slow cooling of the melt. For a number of alloys including the multicomponent Pd-Ni-P, Au-Pb-Sb, Zr-Cu-Ni-Al, and Zr-Ti-Ni-Cu-Be alloys the relevant thermodynamic and thermomechanical properties of the metastable glassy and undercooled liquid states have been measured below and above the glass transition temperature. These measurements include specific heat, viscosity, density and elastic properties as functions of temperature. As a result it becomes obvious that the maximum undercooling for these alloys is given by an isentropic condition before an enthalpic or isochoric instability is reached. Alternatively, these glasses can also be produced by mechanical alloying, thus replacing the thermal disorder by static disorder and resulting in the same thermodynamic glass state. For the &quot;weaker&quot; glasses the isentropic instability also coincides with a divergence of the viscosity. During heating through the undercooled liquid a nanoscale phase separation occurs for most glasses as a precursor of crystallization. Further measurements of the mechanical and tribological wear properties point to the unique engineering applications of this new class of advanced materials.

Recent studies indicate that moisture-induced hydrogen embrittlement is a major cause of low ductility and brittle fracture of many intermetallic alloys in moist air at ambient temperature. This embrittlement involves the reaction of reactive elements in intermetallic alloys with the moisture in air and the generation of atomic hydrogen which penetrates into crack tip and causes loss of tensile ductility. In the current study, bulk amorphous alloys based on Zr-Al-Ti-Cu-Ni were tested in tension at room temperature in various environments. Preliminary results indicate that the tensile fracture strength of about 1400 MPa is not strongly affected by test environments. These results alone do not rule out the possibility that these amorphous alloys may react with moisture during tensile testing. Additional work involving laser desorption spectroscopy will be conducted in order to detect this reaction.

It is shown that this zone could be made as narrow as 10-100 mm. Thermo-Electric Moving Force (TEMF) for thermocouples made from Fe-B, Ni-Fe-Si-B, and Co-Fe-Si-B alloys was measured. TEMF of thermocouple made from Co-Fe-Si-B alloy in its as-cast condition can achieve 8.1 &#181;V/K, and it is constant in the range 293K to 593K. It is shown that relaxation of the amorphous structure affects the TEMF of amorphous-crystalline thermocouple. (Patent is applied)

INFLUENCE OF THE CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS OF GRAIN BOUNDARIES ON THEIR ENERGETIC, KINETIC AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES:</B> <I>E. Rabkin</I>, Wolfgang Gust, Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r Metallforschung and Institut f&uuml;r Metallkunde, Seestr. 75, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany
<P>
We review the recent experimental data about the dependence of the grain boundary (GB) energy on the misorientation of adjacent grains and on the inclination of the GB plane. The relationship between inclination dependence of the GB energy and the morphology of faccted twin Gbs in Cu and Ag is demonstrated. The kinetics of development of the faccted morphology at the originally flat twin GB in Cu is studied experimentally. The strong influence of small additions of Bi on the chemical compositions of Gbs in Cu is shown. The effect of atomic ordering on the GB energy is considered. The discontinuous ordering reaction in Fe-50 at.% Co alloy in combination with the analysis of the electron backscattered Kikuchi patterns is used to study the atomic mobility in Gbs in the ordered B2 alloy. It is shown that the low energy special Gbs exhibit also the decreased atomic mobility.

THE EFFECTS OF GRAIN BOUNDARY MISORIENTATION ON M23C6 PRECIPITATION AND SENSITIZATION IN 304 STAINLESS STEEL:</B> <I>Elizabeth Trillo</I>, L.E. Murr, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968
<P>
The correlation between grain boundary misorientation and energy has been the subject of study even before Stickler and Vinckier (in 1963) demonstrated that sensitization behavior is related to the energy of different types of individual boundaries in the sensitizing temperature range of 500-850&#176;C. This research goes beyond these types of studies by attempting to uncover the role of grain boundary misorientation on M23C6 precipitation behavior in 304 stainless steel. The four materials utilizaed in this study having differing carbon contents (0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.07%C) and were heat treated at 670&#176;C for 10 and 50 hours. In addition, the 10 hour samples were deformed (0, 10, and 20% true strain) to observe simultaneous strain effects. Electrochemical Potentiostatic Reactivation (EPR) tests were performed to characterize the sensitization behavior, and the precipitation behavior was observed through the transmission electron microscope (TEM) at 200kV. A &quot;critical nucleation energy&quot; was found to be in the range of 16 mJ/m2 to 265 mJ/m2 which corresponds to the energies of special boundaries, no precipitation was observed on coherent twin boundaries (#16 mJ/m2).

GRAIN BOUNDARY SEGREGATION AND PRECIPITATION EFFECTS ON ENVIRONMENT-INDUCED CRACKING:</B> <I>S.M. Bruemmer</I>, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, P.O. Box 999, Richland, WA
<P>
Environment-induced cracking at internal interfaces has long been explained due to local chemistry differences. Widespread use of high resolution analytical techniques (analytical transmission electron microscopy and scanning Auger microscopy) has recently &quot;quantified&quot; this effect by direct correlation's between grain boundary composition and intergranular failure. Examples of this quantification will be presented and critical interfacial compositions identified for various metallic alloys. material susceptibility can often be minimized by controlling segregation and precipitation characteristics at grain boundaries. Compositional anisotropy among internal interfaces, and its effect on cracking, will also be demonstrated and discussed.

Ni-Cr-Fe Alloy (UNS N06690) is being widely used as corrosion resistant tubing material in nuclear power plants and believed beneficial to stress corrosion resistance to have intergranular chromium carbide precipitates (semi-continuously or continuously). Alloys were prepared through VIM and ESR and tubular products were fabricated by pilgering process. Several solution heat treatments were conducted at a relatively rapid heating and cooling rate. Selective precipitation of chromium carbide along grain boundary was observed in this alloy. Even along a single grain boundary carbide precipitates were revealed as very discretely distributed in association with twins. Distribution and orientation relationship of precipitates with grain boundary in association with twins were analyzed through electron microscopy and explained with CSL model.

ATOMISTIC STUDIES OF SOLUTE-ATOM SEGREGATION AT GRAIN BOUNDARIES IN METALS: SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTS:</B> <I>David N. Seidman</I>, Northwestern University, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Evanston, IL 60208-3108
<P>
I review our studies of the relationship between the atomic structure of grain boundaries (GB) and solute-segregation in binary metallic alloys. The principal experimental tool utilized to measure segregation is atom-probe microscopy. This is used in conjunction with Monte Carlo techniques (Metropolis algorithm and overlapping distributions MC) to explore the multidimensional GB phase space. Experimentally we determine the five macroscopic degrees of a GB employing transmission electron microscopy and then determine the Gibbsian interfacial excess of solute of the same GB employing atom-probe microscopy. The simulational approach uses lattice statics calculations to determine initially the lowest energy GB structures and then MC simulations to calculate their Gibbsian excesses. The effects of both the macroscopic and microscopic degrees of freedom are studied. It is demonstrated that the Gibbsian excess is a complicated function of both the macroscopic and microscopic degrees of freedom. Also a GB's atomic structure determines the partition between segregation at dislocation's cores and in the elastic stress fields of GB dislocations. It is concluded that none of the geometric criteria discussed in the literature is capable of predicting the propensity for GB segregation.

INTERFACE ENGINEERING FOR SINTERING CORDIERITE GLASS-CERAMIC COATINGS ON MOLYBDENUM:</B> Thomas A. Kuhr, <I>Guo-Quan Lu</I>, Dept. of MSE, VPI &amp; SU, Blacksburg, VA 24061
<P>
An economical technology for laying down thick ceramic coatings on a metal substrate is to tape-cast a ceramic slurry on the metal surface followed by binder burn-out and sintering. We used the technology to produce cordierite coatings on molybdenum for use as electrostatic wafer chucks. A critical issue in the production was adhesion between the two materials after the coatings were sintered at temperatures ranging from 900&#176;C to 1000&#176;C. To solve the problem, thin metallic interlayers were deposited by electroplating on Mo surface before tape-casting. We will discuss the selection and processing of several interlayer materials that significantly enhanced adhesion between the ceramic coating and metal substrate.

ADVANCE IN STUDY OF NON-EQUILIBRIUM SEGREGATION ON INTERFACE:</B> <I>Xinlai He</I>, Huaiyang Cui, Department of Materials Physics, University of Science and Technology Beijing, 100083, Beijing, China
<P>
Equilibrium segregation of solute on interface has been recognized quite a long time. In recent years, there are more interests in non-equilibrium segregation, for example, the boron non-equilibrium segregation on grain boundaries during cooling, annealing and pre-strained treatment has been studied systematically. In 1991, by means of Particle Tracking Autoradiograph (PTA) technique, it was found that boron non-equilibrium segregates on moving boundaries during recrystallization in low carbon steels (X.L.He). In Fe-3%Si alloy with b.c.c. structure, it was observed that no detectable boron segregation on boundaries during continuous cooling and annealing but a stronger boron segregation on moving boundaries during recrystallization (S.H.Zhang, 1992). Recently, in Fe-30%Ni with f.c.c. structure, a significant segregation of boron was shown on recrystallizing boundaries while segregation of boron was hardly observed on primary grain boundaries during recrystallization at high temperature (H.Y.Cui, 1995). These investigations indicate that three characteristics relate with the moving boundary segregation: (1)the segregation accompanied with motion of boundary (2)the degree of the segregation was higher than that at thermodynamical equilibrium (3)the velocity of moving boundary and addition of alloy elements influenced on the segregation process. In order to explain the phenomenon, based on the interaction between dislocations and the moving boundaries during recrystallization, a dislocation relaxation and widening grain boundary mechanism of solute segregation on moving boundaries was proposed.

Molecular-dynamics simulations are used to induce the migration of a flat (001) twist grain boundary (GB) by anistropically straining a bicrystal of Cu at high temperatures. The observed migration process has the following three characteristic features: (1) the motion of the GB is viscous and continuous; (2) the observed drift velocity is proportional to the applied driving force and thermally activated; (3) the activation energy for migration is significantly lower than either that for GB diffusion or that for self-diffusion in molten Cu. The atomic-level mechanism of grain-boundary migration is discussed. *Work supported by the US Department of energy, BES-Materials Science under Contract No. W-31-109-Eng-38.

TiNi intermetallic compounds were manufactured by the self-propagating high-temperature synthesis process. The effects of chemical composition(Ni/Ti=0.5 ~2.0 molar ratio), compaction pressure and preheating temperature on the reaction were investigated. As the molar ratio of Ni, compacting pressure and preheating temperature were increased, the combustion temperature and its velocity were increased. In the every mole ratio of M, without preheating, secondary phases such as Ti2Ni, TiNi3, Ti3Ni4 as TiNi were found in the products according to the XRD analysis. At the same condition, the products prepared by of 200 were TiNi single phases by perfect reaction. Hence, the reasons to form the different phases during the reaction and the forming mechanism of TiNi for combustion reaction were discussed.

RAPID SYNTHESIS OF NANOSTRUCTURAL INTERMETALLICS AND THEIR BULK MECHANICAL PROPERTIES: </B>S.M. Pickard, A.K. Ghosh, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2136
<P>
A PVD process has been developed to produce bulk intermetallics at high rate by direct vacuum evaporation. Independent elemental sources are directly heated using 5kW electron beams and the evaporate is deposited as a nanolaminated (layered) structure at a rate of 1-mm/minute on a rotating substrate. Insitu reaction occurs on the heated substrate to produce a homogenous nanograined bulk intermetallic deposit. The deposit can be further thermomechanically processed to produce optimum mechanical properties. TIA1, NiA1 binary and ternary alloy systems has been chosen for initial evaluation of potential mechanical property and processing advantages of bulk PVD. Both relatively thin 9140-180mm) and relatively thick (2.3) mm) layers of intermetallic alloys, have been formed. Hardness characterisation of the -deposited film shows a Vickers hardness value which is 2-3 times higher than the expected value for an as cast alloy. An initial flow stress of 700-800 MPa has been observed for the T1A1, which is higher than that of conventional cast material, with delimitation failure of the layered material. Tests on the bulk material using 3-Point banding indicate and rupture strength of 450-500MPa for Ti-30a% A1, with linear-elastic loading response to failure, indicative of extrinsic defect controlled strength. Elevated temperature tensile tests are being conducted on the intermetallics to determine rate sensitivity.

Be-Al alloys are unique, light weight, composite alloys that combine high specific stiffness and substantial strength with good ductility and toughness. This combination of properties makes these alloys attractive for many high performance aerospace applications. Due to the inherent problems associated with casting Be-Al alloys, processing of these alloys has previously been restricted to rolling or extrusion of prealloyed powder compacts. Beralcast(363 is a new cast in-situ composite alloy containing 65 wt% Be that is formed by the controlled solidification processing of a higher-order Be-Al alloy. This paper will describe the development of the Beralcast( family of alloys specifically for production of near net shape components via investment casting.

The production of TiA1-based alloys with small grain sizes has been approached in two distinct ways. Firstly, by addition of B-containing compounds to the melt and secondly via atomisation and subsequent processing. These route coupled with hot extrusion, allow control of the microstructure of these alloys so that a wide range of properties can be obtained. Results for several different alloys will be presented and the influence of composition on control of microstructure and hence of properties will be illustrated.

MICROSTRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF GAMMA TITANIUM ALUMINIDE STRIP: </B>Gopal Das, Pratt &amp; Whitney, P.O. Box 109600, West Palm Beach, FL-33410-9600
<P>
Thin gamma titanium aluminide (Ti-45A1-2Cr-2Nb at.%) series, 20 mils thick, were produced by the melt overflow rapid solidification technology (MORST) process. The microstructure resulting from heat treatments was studied by a combination of optical, X-ray, SEM and TEM methods. Transition temperatures including the alpha transits temperature were determined by DTA. Textures of gamma TiA1 strips were studied on as-cast and heat treated specimens. The microhardness was measured for specimens subjected to different heat treatments. Tensile properties of heat treated specimens were determined at RT-760&#176;C along the strip growth direction and perpendicular to it. The material failed in a brittle manner at RT for both orientations. It started to yield at 650&#176;C and at 760&#176;C, it failed in a ductile manner. The strain-to-failure along the direction perpendicular to strip growth direction was poor. Deformation microstructure was analysed by TEM and fractographs were studied. Results will be compared with those of investment cast and wrought gamma titanium aluminised. This work was supported by NASA LeRC, Cleveland, OH under Contract No. NAS3-26385.

TRIBOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT METHODS FOR COATINGS:</B> <I>Stephen M. Hsu,</I> National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899
<P>
Coatings are increasingly being used as a means to protect materials from harsh environments. As the coating technology becomes more sophisticated, the requirement for new and better measurement techniques to understand wear mechanisms and coating effectiveness soars. For functionally gradient coatings, the issue of measuring local properties vs global properties in determining the extent of compositional change necessary to achieve a particular performance level is critical. For very thin hard coatings on relatively soft substrates, the deformation and yielding of the substrate affect the coating effectiveness. This paper presents some new and novel techniques that can be used to measure the coating properties under rubbing conditions.

A variety of alloy and compound coatings can be synthesized using plasma-based techniques. At high target bias voltages, implantation of ions into the target can be achieved to dose levels sufficient to bring about beneficial surface modification. The range of compositions achievable, low processing temperatures and environmental cleanliness makes this technique potentially attractive for a number of applications. The paper will focus on the design and development of wear resistant coatings using the plasma source ion implantation method operated in the ion-assisted deposition mode. Results of microstructural characterization and tribological evaluation of these coatings will be presented.

A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF MECHANICAL PROPERTIES IN COATED SYSTEMS BY INSTRUMENTED INDENTATION:</B> <I>Larry Seitzman,</I> Code 6170 Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC 20375
<P>
Vickers indentation was performed on a variety of coating-substrate combinations. Force-displacement curves were obtained by continuously monitoring the loading and unloading of the indentor. Different methodologies for analyzing the data (i.e. shape effect vs contact depth as well as regression vs polynomial fitting) were compared. Mechanical property profiles of the coated system were obtained from both the loading and the unloading curves, and the properties determined from both curves were compared. Analysis of the unloading curve readily yields hardness and elastic modulus data, while analysis of the loading curve yields additional information. The potential for using instrumented indentation as a quality control tool for coated systems will be discussed.

DAMAGE MECHANISM IN SOLID PARTICLE EROSION OF FeAl-Al203 THERMAL SPRAY COATINGS:</B> <I>Brian Schorr</I>, Arnold Marder, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA 18015; Daniel Sordelet, Iowa State University, Ames Laboratory, Ames, IA 50011
<P>
The effect of microstructure and splat cohesion on the erosion damage mechanism of FeAl-Al203 plasma and high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) coatings was studied. The Al203 content in the cermet pre-sprayed powders was varied from 0-80%. Microstructural evaluation revealed a good correlation between the Al203 in the pre-sprayed powders and the final as deposited plasma coatings. In addition, increased porosity was measured as the Al203 content of the coatings increased. It was found that plasma sprayed coatings tend to fail via splat delamination due to poor cohesion and high porosity, providing accelerated weight loss compared to HVOF and wrought alloys. The addition of Al203 to the plasma sprayed FeAl increased the erosion rate of the tested coatings. Examination of the eroded surfaces revealed cracking of the Al203 which led to undercutting of the FeAl matrix. In contrast, partial removal of splats by gouging as well as cracking occurred in the HVOF coatings.

Ti-45.0 at% Al-1.6% Mn intermetallic compounds, which were fabricated by reactive sintering, were boronized in the temperature range 1150 to 1250&#176;C under a flow of Ar gas in a graphite pack with boron carbide (B4C) powders. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to investigate the phase present in the coating layer. The coating layer was composed of Ti2B, TiB, and Al2Ti4C2 phases. The formation mechanism of the above compounds in the coating layer was investigated. Some vacancies were found below the coating layer. The thickness of the coating layer increased with increasing boronizing temperature and time. The activation energy of formation of the coating layer was calculated to be 320 Kj/mole. The microhardness of the coating layer was extremely high (700-800 Hv), compared to that (300-400Hv) of the substrate, improving the resistance to wear and high-temperature oxidation.

THE WEAR-RESISTANCE OF TiNi INTERMETALLICS WITH TiN COATING:</B> <I>H.C. Lin</I>, H.M. Liao, J.L. He, K.M. Lin, K.C. Chen, Department of Materials Science, Feng Chia University. Taichung, Taiwan 407, China
<P>
The wear resistance of TiNi intermetallics with TiN coating was studied by wear test, hardness measurement, XRD and microstructure observation. Both TiN and Ti2Ni layers are found to form on the surface of ion-nitrided TiNi intermetallics. These layers can improve the wear-resistance of these TiNi intermetallics. The effects of nitriding temperatures, TiN/Ti2Ni thickness and applied wear-load on the wear behavior of TiNi intermetallics are investigated in this paper. Meanwhile, the major wear mechanisms in these ion-nitrided TiNi intermetallics are also discussed.

INTERMETALLIC MATRIX COMPOSITES PREPARED BY MECHANICAL ATTRITION: A REVIEW:</B> <I>Carl C. Koch</I>, Department of Materials Science &amp; Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695
<P>
The interest in intermetallic matrix composites has grown in recent years due to the realization that monolithic intermetallics would not likely satisfy the balance of properties needed for advanced aerospace systems. Processing of intermetallic matrix composites is a critical issue and a number of methods have been explored to fabricate such composites with either continuous or discontinuous reinforcements. While the latter category in general provides less improvement in mechanical behavior, this is the type of composite where mechanical alloying may provide an inexpensive processing route. Intermetallic systems to be discussed include Ni3Al, NiAl, Ti3Al, TiAl, and MoSi2. Early work on oxide dispersions in intermetallics by mechanical alloying, dispersions introduced by cryomilling, and nanocrystalline intermetallic composites will be covered by this review. The possibility of superplastic forming of nanocrystalline intermetallic matrix composites will also be considered.

SYNTHESIS OF NANOSTRUCTURED SiC/Si3N4 COMPOSITE POWDERS THROUGH REACTION MILLING:</B> Z.-G. Yang, L. Shaw, Department of Metallurgy and Materials Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269
<P>
In this study, synthesis of SiC/Si3N4 nanocomposite powders through reaction milling was investigated. Graphite and silicon powders were used as the source of carbon and silicon respectively, while the source of nitrogen was from either nitrogen or ammonia gases. Various compositions of the starting powder mixtures for forming nanopowders spanning from pure SiC to pure Si3N4 were investigated. It was found that nanocrystalline SiC powders could be synthesized at ambient temperature by milling silicon and graphite powders in argon atmosphere. However, the formation of SiC was retarded when milling was conducted in nitrogen or ammonia atmosphere. Crystalline Si3N4 formed only after post annealing the milled powder mixtures and the annealing temperature had a strong effect on the formation of the composite powders. Based on the results from XRD, TEM, DTA and TGA, the formation mechanisms of the composite powders will be discussed.

AN INVESTIGATION OF THE VACUUM HOT PRESSING BEHAVIOR OF SILICON CARBIDE FIBERS COATED WITH NANOCRYSTALLINE Ti-6Al-4V:</B> Joseph M.

<P>
The vacuum hot pressing of silicon carbide monofilaments coated with nanocrystalline Ti-6A1-4V has been studied and modeled. In the experiments, surprisingly high identification rates were observed, even at processing temperatures and pressures well below those used for processing conventional Ti-6A1-4V. From the cross sections of partially consolidated specimen, the evolution of coated fiber-fiber contacts and pore shapes were determined. The pores were found to be cusp-shaped throughout the consolidation process. Columns of coated fibers were observed to form which resulted in regions of locally high fiber volume fraction. In the model, the initial densification was based upon a micromechanical contact analysis for a metal coated fiber. Final stage densification was analyzed by modifying the Qian et al strain rate potential for a power law creeping body containing isolated cusp-shaped pores. Simulations of the VHP experiments were performed using this model which incorporated time and temperature dependent microstructure relations. Overall, the simulations compared well with the experimental density data, although the load supported by the regions of locally high fiber volume fraction resulted in the model slightly overestimating the observed densification time response.

<P>
The metallization of structural ceramic fibers by physical vapor deposition, sputtering, etc., followed by consolidation (e.g. hot isostatic pressing) offers an attractive route for the manufacture of continuous fiber-reinforced metal matrix composites (MMC's). Recent models for describing the evolution of key microstructural features (such as porosity, interfacial reaction zone thickness and fiber microbending/fracture) during consolidation are described, and are combined to simulate changes in the composite's microstructural &quot;state&quot; during arbitrary consolidation process schedules. Results are presented for PVD Ti-6Al-4V -coated SiC monofilament fibers consolidated by vacuum hot pressing which illustrate the presence of optimal solutions to the process path planning problem. An optimization scheme is briefly described which allows identification of the consolidation process cycle providing maximum relative density with minimum fiber and interfacial damage. In addition to the process schedule, optimal quality is shown to depend strongly on the fiber/matrix combination, the initial coated fiber packing geometry and the (evolving) matrix microstructural state.

MODEL-BASED SIMULATION OF THE CONSOLIDATION PROCESSING:</B> R.Vancheeswaran, <I>H. N. G. Wadley</I>, Intelligent Processing of Materials Laboratory, Department of Materials Science &amp; Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903
<P>
The performance of fiber reinforced titanium matrix composites (TMC) made by consolidation of spray deposited monotapes is strongly influenced by the processing conditions used. This high temperature consolidation step must simultaneously minimize fiber microbending/fracture, the interfacial reaction product layers at the fiber-matrix interface and at the same time eliminate matrix voids (i.e. increase the relative density). These three microstructural variables have conflicting dependencies upon the consolidation process variables (temperature, pressure and time), and it has been difficult to identify process pathways by trial and error that lead to composites of acceptable quality (where the fiber damage and reaction layer thickness are kept below some bounds, while matrix porosity is eliminated). Models for predicting the microstructure's dependence upon process conditions (i.e. the time varying temperature and pressure) are combined with consolidation equipment dynamics to simulate the microstructure evolution and to assess the relative &quot;processability&quot; of several silicon carbide fiber/titanium alloy matrix systems during their consolidation. We introduce the idea of process failure surfaces and show how this simulation tool in conjunction with a model predictive control (algorithm), is able to design &quot;locally&quot; optimal process cycles that minimize fiber damage, reaction product layer thickness and porosity. The approach is then used to path plan process schedules that will steer away from these damage surfaces for a variety of TMC systems.

Zircon, ZrSiO4, is a thermally stable mineral. Owing to its abundance, high hardness, excellent abrasion/wear resistance and low coefficient of thermal expansion, researchers are investigating its use for medium strength, tribological applications. In the present study, the conventional low-cost, double compaction powder metallurgy route in the synthesis of Al-13.5Si-2.5 Mg alloy(wt%) reinforced with ZrSiO4, was investigated. The mechanical, physical and tribological properties were determined following the development of optimum conditions of compaction and sintering. At 0.15Vf, the UTS, 0.2%Y.S. and hardness improved by 4%, 12.8% and 88% respectively while the adhesive wear rate and the coefficient of friction reduced by 99.55 and 35.5% respectively. At a critical volume fraction of zircon, between 0.03 and 0.05, a significant improvement in wear resistance was observed. The use of optical microscopy, EPMA, SEM and x-ray analysis revealed the phases and possible reactions at the matrix-reinforcement interface, fracture mode and compositions of fractured surfaces which are related to measured mechanical properties and, the influence of the reinforcement phase on wear rate. Further structural analysis showed that the improvement in mechanical properties is attributed largely to the load-bearing ability and intrinsic hardness of zircon than to particulate dispersion effects. An attempt was made to model the strength of the composites.

OPTIMIZATION OF ALUMINA PLANT OPERATION WITH RESPECT TO MARKET CONDITION:</B> <I>P. Das</I>, National Aluminium Company Ltd., Damanjodi, Dist. Koraput, Orissa 763008, India
<P>
In international markets, wide fluctuations of alumina prices have been found to be a common phenomenon over the years. It has been observed that almost all the buoyant cycles have essentially been followed by recessionary market conditions. Hence, during the periods when alumina prices are relatively low, for survival it becomes obligatory on the part of the management to strike an operational philosophy suitable for achieving minimum cost of production. However, during buoyant market conditions it is wise to make attempts for maximization of production by suitable optimization of process parameters even if there is a marginal increase in unit cost of production. Since such attempts are directly related to the profitability of the organization, a careful study should be made taking into consideration all interrelated factors. This paper highlights the areas of an alumina plant where changes in process parameters, permissible on technoeconomic consideration, could be made for optimization of production and profitability.

Process engineers at Alcoa's Point Comfort refinery are using a dynamic model of the Bayer precipitation area to evaluate options in operating strategies. The dynamic simulator, a joint development effort between Point Comfort and Alcoa Technical Center, predicts process yield, particle size distributions, and occluded soda for a given flowsheet of the precipitation and classification circuit. In addition to rigorous material and particle population balances, the model includes mechanistic kinetic expressions for particle growth, agglomeration, nucleation, and attrition. The kinetic parameters have been tuned to Point Comfort's data with excellent matches between the model results and plant data. The model is written for the ACSL package with specially developed input/output graphical user interfaces which provide a user-friendly tool.

In this paper, secondary nucleation of aluminum trihydroxide in Bayer sodium aluminate solution was discussed by picture analysis and scanning electron micrograph. The effects of temperature, seed size and aluminate concentration on secondary nucleation are determined with growth time. As this study has shown, the nucleation rate depends upon the experimental conditions of supersaturation, temperature and seed size or surface area.

Understanding the physics and chemistry of boundary-layers, the thin stagnant zones that form at each bath interface, clarifies many cell phenomena. A non-wetting boundary at the anode causes the anode effect. The effect of bath velocity on the boundary-layer thickness and its effect on the heat transfer coefficient coupled with bath temperature and bath composition explains the formation and loss of frozen ledge and its relationship to heat losses from the cell walls. Similarly, the boundary-layer at the bath-aluminum interface ex plains cathodic overvoltage, the sodium content of the aluminum, current efficiency and the relationship of each to metal pad stability (magneto-hydrodynamic stability).

ON THE COMPOSITION OF SOLID DEPOSITS FROZEN OUT FROM CRYOLITIC MELTS:</B> <I>Asbj&oslash;rn Solheim</I>, Lisbet I. R. St&oslash;en, SINTEF Materials Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway
<P>
Thermodynamically, the primary crystallization product formed by cooling a melt containing cryolite, AlF3, Al2O3 and CaF2 is expected to be cryolite with minor amounts of CaF2 and AlF3 in solid solution. In practice, however, any deposit frozen out from such melts may contain considerable amounts of bath constituents other than cryolite. The factors governing the composition of the freeze are studied theoretically and by experiment. Besides solid solution, the composition depends on two factors, 1) diffusion of bath constituents from the surface of the deposit towards the bulk of the melt, and 2) dendritic crystal growth with subsequent trapping of bath between the crystals. The condition which gives dendrite formation is formulated. Based on this criterion, a deposit frozen out from melts containing excess AlF3 and alumina would contain more AlF3 than a deposit frozen out from a melt containing excess AlF3 alone. This was confirmed by experiment.

THE GAS UNDER ANODES IN SMELTING CELLS. Part I: MEASURING AND MODELLING BUBBLE RESISTANCE UNDER HORIZONTAL DE-ORIENTED ELECTRODES: </B><I>T. M. Hyde</I>, B. J. Welch, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand
<P>
With a continuing drive to reduce energy and the tighter operating tolerances of modern aluminium smelting cells, there is an ever increasing need for a precise cell voltage equation. Precise correlation exists for the electrical conductivity in smelting cells, the reverse is not the case for the added resistance effect of gas bubbles. Where it has been allowed for, the models used have been based on those proposed for vertically oriented electrodes. Furthermore the measurements on which the model is based can be influenced by other electrochemical changes while the shape and dispersion and gas bubble differ from those expected in aluminium smelting cells based on model studies. An apparatus and high speed switching data acquisition technique have been developed to allow the ohmic resistance of a molten salt electrolyte to be isolated from all other contributors. Ceramic objects of known geometry, size and volume, rest in the electrolyte immediately under the upper electrode (anode) thus simulating gas bubbles. The technique developed enables the measurement of the direct increase in resistance due to the introduced volume of non-conducting simulated gas. The bubble parameters examined included volume, electrode coverage, depth and shape. The resulting data have been tested against existing models.

Recent physical models have suggested that the gas bubbles formed under anodes in smelting cells tend to coalesce and release as large bubbles predominantly. Whilst it is well established that the gas bubbles increase the cell resistance, and correlations proposed include the gas volume or bubble layer depth and surface coverage. However, the volume and degree of coverage of the electrodes have been subject to speculation rather than accurate measurements. In this investigation, using a larger than normal laboratory cell, it has been confirmed that the gas released is consistent with the physical models with most of the gas being evolved in discreet large bubbles. The release frequency is similar to the dominant frequency found in operating cells. The average gas volume under an anode prior to release is between 0.4 and 0.5 cm3 per cm2 of electrode. From combined resistance studies it has been calculated that approximately two thirds of the anode is covered with gas at release with an average bubble thickness of 5 mm.

<P>
Nonequilibrium thermodynamics for surfaces has been applied to the interface ledge-electrolyte in aluminium electrolysis cells. The method describes the interface as a layer of finite thickness <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif">, having a bath-like part and a ledge-like part, with properties differing from the bulk properties. The method can explain the heat transfer coefficient for the interface in a new way, namely as a combination of the thermal conductivities in the two parts of the interface. Examples are given to show how the temperature &quot;jump&quot; between the two bulk phases may either be located in the ledge-like part of the interface, in the bath-like part, or in both. In analysis of ledge growth, the possibility of different surface temperatures should be taken into account, because this temperature may, together with the temperatures close to the interface on both sides, determine the rate of freezing or melting. It is also shown how the simple steady state model can be expanded into a dynamic one.

A remote sensing system for continuous measurement of HF and other gases has been developed based on eye-safe turnable gases. The laser, its controls and data acquisition system are contained in a small instrument which can be located anywhere in the plant, such as the control room. The optical beam is transported to one or more stacks or ducts by fibre optics which may be kilometres in length. It is then directed across the stack and returned by a retroreflector to the same optical fibre and retroreflector combination for pot-room or roof-top monitoring. The use of optical multiplexing permits a single instrument to make simultaneous measurements at a number of locations providing a very cost effective system which can operate in any environment. Systems have been installed in four Canadian smelters and one in the UK. Examples of some of the measurements made with these systems will be presented.

MEASUREMENT OF GAS COMPOSITIONS USING SOLID ELECTROLYTES:</B> R.V. Kumar, <I>D.J. Fray</I>, Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3QZ, United Kingdom
<P>
Sensors are required to measure gaseous species such as SOX, NOX, HCl, and water vapour at elevated temperatures. There are very few solid electrolytes which respond to these gases, and furthermore, the species are usually present with other gases to which the electrolyte may respond. In addition, for long periods of operation, a stable reference is required. In order to meet these challenges, sensors consisting of two electrolytes in intimate contact have been developed. To measure HCl, a proton-conducting electrolyte is interfaced with strontium chloride. The reaction for the cell: (-) Pt, Air + HCl(g))/SrCl2//SrCeO3 + 10 mole % Nd2O3// Air + HCl(g), Pt(+). At the various interfaces, the reactions are: anode: 2Cl- + SrHCl = SrCl2 + HCl(g) + 2e-interface: 2H+ + 2Cl- = 2HCl(interface) cathode: HCl(interface) + SrCl2 + 2e- = SrHCl + 2Cl- overall cell reaction: HCl(interface) = HCl(g). The net result is that the potential is independent of the oxygen potential of the gas and the reference is given by the interaction of the two electrolytes. There is no need for an external reference which overcomes the problems of forming gas thigh seals at elevated temperatures. Other examples of this approach for the measurement of SOX, NOX, CO2, and H2O will be given.

DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF OXYGEN SENSORS IN COPPER METALLURGY: </B> <I>S. Seetharaman</I>, Du Sichen, A. Jakobsson, Division of Theoretical Metallurgy, Royal Institute of Technology, S-100 44 Stockholm, Sweden
<P>
Oxygen concentration cells with stabilized zirconia electrolytes are widely used today to measure the activity of oxygen in liquid metals. In the case of liquid copper, the activity of oxygen in the molten metal as well as the effect of a third element on the same have been extensively studied using galvanic cells of the type (-) Pt, W or cermet / Cu-O-M // ZrO2 (stabilized) // AO, A / Pt (+, where M is the third element in molten copper and AO / A represents a suitable oxide/metal reference electrode. The effect of a number of &quot;third elements&quot; like Mn, Zn, As, Se, and Te on the oxygen activity in liquid copper have been studied by this method. The Mn and Zn interact very strongly with oxygen in Cu ( ), while, in the case of arsenic, the interaction parameter is nearly zero. The behavior of Se and Te in liquid copper with respect to the effect on the activity of oxygen is unique. At oxygen levels of the order of 10-4, these elements lower the activity coefficient of oxygen in the melt, while, at lower oxygen levels, the interaction parameter values are positive. These results are discussed in the light of some of the theoretical models for solute interactions in liquid metals. The application of these sensors in flash smelting, converter, and casting sections of copper production are discussed along with their implications on process optimization.

We have developed a unique all&#173;silica fiberoptic probe which can have analytical applications in the temperature range where silica is a solid, 0&#176; to 1600&#176;C, and in chemical situations where it is inert. We have also developed techniques to use the ratio of the Stokes/anti&#173;Stokes Raman emission of diamond to measure temperature in the range of 400 to 1000&#176;C. We will discuss our results of such measurements in molten chloride and fluoride salts, other liquids, and solids. We will also describe our plans for temperature measurements by Raman spectroscopy through optical fibers in the range of 1000 to 2500&#176;C, a range that can include molten metals such as steel.

SOLID STATE CURRENT-POTENTIAL SWEEP SENSOR FOR THE IN-SITU MONITORING OF COMPOSITION AND TRANSPORT PROPERTIES IN HIGH TEMPERATURE METALLURGICAL SLAGS:</B> S.C. Britten, V. Stancovski, <I>U.

<P>
An in-situ solid-state electrochemical technique for measuring the concentrations of easily dissociable oxides in slags at temperatures between 1200 to 1600&#176;C is being developed. The technique consists of using a stabilized zirconia solid electrolyte, which conducts oxygen ions, to separate a reference gas compartment from the slag of interest. Using a potentiostat, a direct current potential sweep is applied between the inner and outer compartments of the electrolyte, driving oxygen ions from the slag into a reference gas. With the use of open circuit reference electrodes, the resulting magnitude of the current potential profile reveals the concentration of dissociable oxides such as those of iron, manganese, and chromium. The open circuit potential recovery indicates the type of oxide present and its thermodynamic activity within the slag. The technique should therefore determine multiple properties of several different oxides with only one measurement. The limits imposed by the electronic short-circuit property of the zirconia electrolyte on the sensitivity of the technique are also under investigation.

APPLICATIONS OF SENSORS IN MOLTEN SALT TECHNOLOGY FOR METAL PROCESSING:</B> P.T. Velu, <I>R.G. Reddy</I>, Dept of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487

The use of emf measurements to derive classical thermochemical data has been in use for many years. The reaction associated with electrochemical process is harnessed in a galvanic cell and energy involved measured in terms of electromotive force. The property requirements of sensor electrodes used differ for various aqueous, molten salt, and solid electrolyte systems. The electrodes for molten salt electrolytes need special care for construction. This paper describes the studies carried using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. This electrode was used to measure the solubility of compounds in molten salt electrolytes. The results obtained using this electrode are in excellent agreement with the values from chemical analysis method.

A novel solid state sensor for measuring arsenic dissolved in molten metals has been developed based on a novel solid electrolyte conducting K+ ions. The solid state sensor can be schematically represented as: (-)Mo, Zn-As/ /K-323 SE/ /K-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">Fe2O3+Fe2O3+02, Fe-Cr(+). The open circuit emf of the above sensor was measured in molten zinc containing less than 0.1 wt % As at a temperature of 823K. The emf of the sensor was found to vary linearly as a function of 1nXAs, where XAs is the mole fraction of As in An(1). The ionic conductivity of the novel solid electrolyte (K-323) was measured over a range of temperature (370&lt;T&lt;770K) using a vector impedance analyzer. The K+ ion conductivity of K-323 at 823K was found to be 1 X 10-3<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-omega.gif">-1cm-1. The performance of these arsenic sensors is currently being evaluated in plants in the United Kingdom and Germany.

MEASUREMENT OF NITROGEN AND SULPHUR IN MOLTEN METALS USING SOLID ELECTROLYTES:</B> Y.C. Avniel, T.E. Warner, <I>D.J. Fray</I>, Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3QZ, United Kingdom
<P>
One of the major problems of the iron and steel industry is the presence of phosphorus, sulphur, nitrogen, and silicon. Careful control and removal of these elements is required, and an on-line measurement of the concentration during removal would greatly improve the efficiency of the process. The oxygen content of molten metals is usually measured by using a sensor based upon stabilized zirconia, in which the oxygen ion is mobile. However, for nitrogen and sulphur, stable ionically conducting solid electrolytes for nitrogen and sulphur do not exist. The approach adopted in this work is to use electrolytes which conduct alkali and alkaline earth elements. For example, when a sodium ion conducting electrolyte is placed in a situation where sodium is not present, the sodium comes to equilibrium with the species which forms the most stable compound with sodium. Examples are given where sodium, strontium, and calcium beta alumina respond to sulphur and oxygen. Regions of response to a given species depend upon the concentration of other species in the melt and the standard free energy of formation of the various compounds. In the case of nitrogen measurement, it proved necessary to develop a new electrolyte, based upon rare earth oxides, in which nitrogen is soluble in the anion lattice. Results are presented for the measurement of sulphur and nitrogen partial pressures and for these species in molten iron and steel.

INDUSTRIAL IN-PULP Co-Ni ALLOY ELECTRO-WINNING AT THE GECAMINES-SHITURU PLANT:</B> K. Twite, J.-M. Dereydt, K. Mujinga, Gecamines Shituru Plant/Likasi, Bd. du Souverain 30, 32, B1170 Brussels, Belgium; P. Louis, Union Miniere, All&eacute;e de la Fr&egrave;naie, B 1300 Wavre, Belgium
<P>
GECAMINES is a large mining concern and the world's leading cobalt producer having some of the richest cobalt deposits in the world. Cobalt is associated in the ore with copper as sulphides and oxides and in some locations with nickel too. Specific hydrometallurgical processes have been developed by GECAMINES which had done an important contribution to the development of the cobalt hydrometallurgy. In the Shituru plant, cobalt is obtained from an unique in-pulp electrolysis process, while in Luilu, cobalt is electrolyzed in a clear acidic solution giving a purer deposit. In the beginning of 1996 Shituru started the treatment of mixed Cu-Co-Ni Shinkolobwe hydrates obtained as by-product of an uranium solvent extraction plant. A typical analysis of this feedstock is: Cu: 2%, Co: 8%, Ni: 4%. The nickel sulfide depolarized cementation process developed previously by GECAMINES was inefficient to treat such a high level of Nickel contamination and it was decided to produce alloyed Cobalt-Nickel cathodes in the Shituru tankhouse. As anticipated from laboratory tests as previous studies and publications, a lower Ni/Co in the deposit was obtained compared to the Ni/Co ratio solution, despite the nickel reversible electrochemical potential is somewhat higher than the one of cobalt (-0.25 V vs -0.28 V). In this paper, the process flow-sheet and production data are given. Cobalt alloy with 5 - 20 % Ni was obtained at a production level of 300 t per month. The process developed is a first industrial realization in this way, bringing a new contribution to cobalt hydrometallurgy.

<P>
Cathodic and anodic reactions in the acidic nitrate medium were studied in reference to the electrolytic production of manganese dioxide from pyrolusite (Mn02) ores by reductive leaching. Two USA ores were investigated. The reductant for Mn02 is produced cathodically and can either be nitrous acid or nitrogen oxide gas. In this work emphasis was placed on the nitrous acid leach. Manganese and silver are solubilized, iron is not. Cathodic regneration of nitrous acid was investigated in the range of 0.5 to 3.0 M nitric acid, 0.0 to 0.1 nitrous acid on graphite, platinum and platinized titanium cathodes at 20 to 80&#176;C. It was established that the formation of the nitrosyl ion (N0+) is a prerequisite for the cathodic reduction of nitric acid. At cathode potentials &lt; +700 mV (SHE), cathodic reduction of nitrous acid to nitric oxide takes place. Anodic deposition of manganese is as flaky <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif">-Mn02, similar to that produced in sulphate electrolytes. A conceptual flowsheet is presented and discussed.

A NOVEL ELECTROMETALLURGICAL PROCESS FOR THE TREATMENT OF REFRACTORY GOLD CONCENTRATES: </B> N. de Jager, M.J. Nicol, University of the Witwatersrand, School of Process and Materials Engineering, Johannesburg, South Africa
<P>
In order to liberate gold from refractory gold ores and concentrates it is necessary to oxidize the surrounding sulphide minerals, typically pyrite and arsenopyrite. Traditional methods of oxidation include pressure leaching, roasting and bacterial oxidation. In recent years, bacterial oxidation has found increasing favour, although it is by no means completely satisfactory and is subject to large residence times. It is also extremely sensitive to operating conditions. Similarly, pressure leaching and roasting have their own particular disadvantages. A novel process has been developed as an alternative to the traditional methods whereby electro-generated ferrate [iron (VI)] ions in alkaline solution are used to oxidize a pyrite concentrate. This process has been observed to proceed fairly rapidly and could prove to be a more economically viable process, as well as being more environmentally acceptable. As an added benefit, operating in an alkaline environment is advantageous for downstream cyanidation processes. Iron (VI) is a relatively unknown species, due mainly to its instability in acidic solutions. However in alkaline solution it has been observed to be sufficiently stable for use as an oxidant when kept under the correct conditions. Iron (VI) is most conveniently manufactured electrolytically via the dissolution of high-carbon iron anodes in strongly alkaline solutions. Some literature has been published on the electrolytic generation of iron (VI) and relatively high efficiencies have been observed by both the authors and other researchers. This study utilizes both electrochemical techniques and leaching experiments to examine the kinetics and mechanism of the oxidation of pyrite by iron (VI). Cyclic voltammetry, rotating disk voltammetry and potential step experiments have been used to investigate the mechanism and kinetics of the oxidation process. Other potentiodynamic and poteniostatic techniques have also been employed. Leaching experiments have been used to provide a more detailed investigation into the kinetics of the process.

ELECTROLYTIC RECOVERY OF MERCURY FROM LOW CONCENTRATION BRINE SOLUTIONS: </B> M. Rockandel, Universal Dynamics Ltd., Vancouver, Canada
<P>
Universal Dynamics Ltd. of Vancouver, Canada has developed, patented and commercialized the &quot;REMERC&quot; process for the treatment of mercury contaminated sludges and soils. Mercury is extracted into an acidified and oxidizing, sodium chloride brine solution. REMERC was initially developed to treat mercury contaminated EPA listed wastes (K106) generated by the chlor-alkali industry. More recent work has expanded the capability of REMERC to include remediation of mercury contaminated sites, equipment and building materials. In the process mercury is currently recovered from solution by cementation on iron powder in an agitated reactor. The process recovers high purity elemental mercury (99.9% purity). Cementation typically recovers about 90-95% of the mercury in 30 minutes. Higher recovery is not necessary because of the recirculation of the leach solution. When treating highly contaminated chloralkali wastes (5-13% mercury content), REMERC will reduce the mercury laden solutions from 400-1,000 mg/l mercury to 50-100 mg/l. In the treatment of less concentrated wastes (&lt;1,000 mg/kg mercury) such as those encountered in site remediation, the treated solutions will generally contain 10-20 mg/l mercury. Cementation while being simple and able to achieve the required recovery has the undesirable properties of; requiring a solid-liquid separation and adding iron to solution which must be precipitated, ultimately increasing the weight of residue to landfill. The potential advantages of electrolysis were recognized early in the development of REMERC. Mercury electrolysis is well known in gold and chloralkali processing. Initial testwork utilized a liquid mercury cathode and a coated titanium anode both common to chloralkali producers. The mercury cathode appeared susceptible to polarization and solution impurities significantly affected performance. Agitation of the mercury pool improved performance but it was still not possible to achieve the reduction objectives. Current efficiencies were low, near 10%, and it was apparent that a relatively large cathode pool would be required to limit the current density. A number of electrode combinations with and without a membrane were then tested in a vertical electrode configuration but the desired performance was not obtained. In 1995 Universal Dynamics working with Dremco Ltd. of Arizona, USA began the development of a plate and frame style electrolytic cell. The objective of the electrolytic process was to achieve similar removals to those obtained by cementation, while producing high purity elemental mercury (&gt;99.9% purity) and chlorine at the anode. Although current efficiency is a relatively minor concern the design objective was to achieve at least 50% CE. The current efficiency goal would require operation of the cell at current densities approaching the limiting current flow. The final cell current densities would therefore be in the range of 0.1 - 1.0 A/m2. Operation of a laboratory scale cell has demonstrated that the operating objectives can be achieved with a cell consisting of closely spaced shiny titanium cathodes and ruthenium oxide coated titanium anodes. Numerous variables were observed to be important including; inter electrode velocity, current density, pH and chlorine stripping. The cell has been tested on solutions generated by two REMERC operations, solution produced during site remediation pilot testing and on more highly concentrated solutions generated by oxidation of calomel generated at Cominco Metals, Norzink facility in Trail, B.C.

Copper and cadmium metal has been recovered from dilute (3 X 10-4 mol/dm3) chloride solutions by ion flotation with dodecysulfate, followed by electrolysis. This approach should facilitate treatment of effluents too dilute for effective direct electrolysis. The adsorption density of metal dodecylsulfate complexes on bubble surfaces was estimated from surface tension data, and compared well with experimentally-observed metal removal kinetics, and ultimate recoveries. Copper and cadmium were recovered by electrolyzing the foamate, using steel wool cathodes and a graphite anode. The stability constants of the copper and cadmium dodecysulfate complexes are estimated, and used to analyze the thermodynamics of electrolysis. Dodecysulfate was unaffected by the electrolysis process, and hence could be recycled to ion flotation. A conceptual flowsheet for an overall effluent-treatment process is presented.

NITROX METALS CORPORATION'S PROCESS FOR DIRECT LEACHING OF COPPER CONCENTRATES:</B> R.N. O'Brien, E. Peters, Vancouver, B.C., V6N 2G1
<P>
It has been discovered that copper concentrates can be leached in strong (40-60%) sulfuric acid with air as the primary oxidant, if nitric acid is present as a catalyst. Chalcopyrite is rapidly decomposed at temperatures well below the boiling temperature of the lixiviant (150C.) and the resulting copper and ferric salts are precipitated as CuSO4 H2O or CuSO43 H2O and FeH(SO4)24H2O. Other metal sulfides such as zinc, lead, nickel, etc. are also converted to sulfates that are nearly insoluble. Sulfur is partially converted to elemental and partially to sulfuric acid. Reduction products of nitric acid can be recovered from the distillate with good recovery. Conversion of as-received copper concentrates is largely complete in about 1 hour. A number of process flow sheets are possible, and one that utilizes existing solvent extraction and electrowinning technology is considered economically feasible. This flow sheet involves (a) separation of metal sulfates and unleachable residues from excess acid by centrifuge, (b) water leaching of salts with partial neutralization (with limestone) of excess acid, to a tenor of 10 g/l Cu2+, (c) solvent extraction of copper using one of the LIX reagents, and (d) precipitating most of the ferric iron from raffinate with more limestone, so that it can be used as recycled water in step (a). Gold and silver are retained in a water insoluble small volume residue also containing any elemental sulfur formed, while minor elements like arsenic, antimony, etc. are retained by the strong sulfuric acid that is centrifuged from solids in step (a). These can be removed from this solution using methods previously developed for the purification of copper electrorefining electrolytes.

ACID RECOVERY AND PURIFICATION USING ABSORPTION RESIN TECHNOLOGY:</B> M. Sheedy, Prosep Technologies Inc., Pickering, Ontario, Canada
<P>
Strong mineral acids, principally sulphuric, are widely used as electrolytes for the electrorefining and electrowinning of metals. Impurities in these electrolytes are controlled by continuously bleeding solution form the tank house. In addition to the contaminant these bleed streams contain high levels of sulphuric acid and the metal being recovered. Subsequent treatment of these bleed streams often requires neutralization which generates large volumes of solid waste. Absorption resin technology employing a novel ion exchange technique known as Recoflo allows the separation of the mineral acid from dissolved metal salts. The recovered acid is suitable for recycle back to the electrolyte circuit. The metal salt and other contaminants leave the process free of sulphuric acid. In this process, known commercially as the APU, ion exchange resin is used to sorb sulphuric acid while excluding the metal salts. The purified acid is then removed by washing the resin with water. The process has been extensively used for the recovery of waste pickling acids in the steel industry and anodizing solutions in the aluminum industry. In the mining industry the process has been successfully evaluated for the separation of excess sulphuric acid from copper electrolytes, the removal of magnesium and manganese contaminants from zinc electrolytes, and antimony, bismuth and nickel from copper electrolytes.

<P>
While aluminum alloys based on the Al-Si-Mg-Cu system are currently being used in the production of a number of automotive body panels, the continuing demands for improved formability in these alloys have led alloy developers to the study of novel compositions and processing practices. Predicting stamping performance for a wide range of alloy variants, however, remains a difficult problem. Uniaxial tension tests, while providing reproducible assessments of mechanical behavior, are performed in a strain state that is quite different from that encountered in most stamping operations. As such, more elaborate, and often and less reproducible, methods of assessment are often employed, such as limiting dome height measurements and the construction of forming limit curves. In the present work, we have analyzed the tensile behavior of a series candidate alloys and used these data to predict the forming limit curve over a range of strain states. Using a modified form of the Voce work-hardening model, a Marciniak-Kuczinski simulation has been constructed and used to predict the forming limit curve minimum (FLC0). These predictions are then related to experimentally determined forming limit curve data for the candidate alloys. The comparison of predicted and measured forming limit curve data indicates that the model can be successfully used to predict mechanical behavior under a state of plane strain using uniaxial tensile data. The results of the model indicate that the slope of the work-hardening curve, particularly at high strain values, is intimately related to the forming limit curve minimum. These correlations provide alloy developers with an inexpensive method of comparing the formability new alloy variants by more thoroughly exploiting the data concealed within the full uniaxial tensile curve.

TOOL WEAR DURING MACHINING OF AA356 ALUMINUM ALLOYS:</B> <I>Zhongnan Dai</I>, J.G. Morris, Light Metals Research Labs, Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506
<P>
As a casting material, AA356 Aluminum alloy is widely used in the automotive industry. During machining, the tool wear mechanism for this alloy is significantly different from that for steel. For different as-cast metallurgical microstructures, materials with harder dispersed particles and stronger matrices show higher resistance to seizure because of an increase in the pressure requirement above which seizure occurs. This results in better machinability. On the other hand, hard particles act as small cutting edges on the tool materials, thereby causing tool wear due to the particle's abrasive characteristics. The wear characteristics of cutting tools were investigated in this study. Scanning electron microscopy, optical microscopy, EDX analysis were used to identify wear mechanisms. The results obtained show that there are a number of different wear mechanisms that contribute to tool damage, and hence, to tool-life. The role of the as cast microstructure on tool wear was also studied in order to determine under what structural states tool wear would be reduced.

THE EFFECTS OF PREAGING TREATMENTS ON FORMABILITY AND PAINT BAKE RESPONSE IN ALUMINUM AUTOBODY SHEET ALLOYS</B>: J. Daniel Bryany, Reynolds Metals Company, Corporate Research and Development, Fourth and Canal Streets, P. O. Box 27003, Richmond, VA 23261
<P>
The use of heat treatable aluminum alloys for automotive body panels is presently increasing, due to aluminum's attractive combination of low density and compatibility with current production methods. In these applications, the automotive paint bake cycle is used to impart a modest artificial aging response, referred to as the paint bake response (PBR), in the alloys following stamping. Unfortunately, the short duration of the paint bake cycle (as dictated by production demands) is generally insufficient to exploit more than a small fraction of the age hardening potential of the alloys. Reynolds Metals Company has developed a thermal treatment which has been shown to be effective in increasing the paint bake response by up to a factor of four, while at the same time improving the formability of alloys and reducing the natural aging rate. Through the use of atomic resolution microscopy and differential thermal calorimetry, the mechanism of pre-aging can be shown to be the result of changes in the precipitation sequence of metastable variants of Mg2Si, resulting in an increase in the precipitation kinetics during the paint bake cycle and a finer distribution of strengthening precipitates in the painted component. Through the use of pre-aging, our research has shown that 6XXX autobody sheet alloys may be produced which have both superior stamping performance as well as higher strengths in the stamped and painted components, resulting in automotive body panels with up to 50% higher dent resistance.

<P>
It has been noted in the literature that superplastically formed Al alloys fail by cavitation. The morphology of the final cavitated fracture region may be important in determining optimum forming conditions, by determining whether failure occurs parallel or perpendicular to the principal stresses. In addition, the displacement control routine may have a large effect on the total elongation that can be expected during forming operations. Tests were performed to evaluate failure in a AA5083 base alloy, by the following methods: 1) uniaxial tension tests at a constant true strain rate were interrupted at 80%, 60,G, 40%, and 5% of the maximum load, and microstructurally evaluated to identify the failure path and 2) tests were performed with various displacement control routines, and the elongation to failure was measured. The following displacement routines were used: smooth test, two-step strain test, multi-bump strain rate tests with various sizes of bumps scheduled at various intervals, and variable load oscillation tests.

EVOLUTION OF ALUMINUM MICROSTRUCTURES IN THE ALUMINUM EXTRUSION PROCESS:</B> Woiciech Z. Misiolek, Aluminum Processing Program, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Troy, New York 121803590
<P>
The final microstructure and its uniformity is responsible for the physical properties and surface quality of the extruded profiles. Extrusion is time dependent process and its deformation variables such as, deformation zone and dead zone geometry as well as extrusion speed and temperature, change in time. The final microstructure depends on the above mentioned extrusion parameters as well as billet microstructure and post processing treatment. Metal flow conditions are influenced by the process parameters. Both physical and numerical process modeling techniques have been applied to predict metal flow behavior during extrusion through dies with different geometries. Additional information, allowing understanding of microstructure evolution, can be obtained from the crystallographic characterization of the typical deformation zone regions such as dead metal zone, main deformation zone and recrystallized zone on the billet-container interface using the electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) technique. This technique has been utilized to follow in detail the orientation aspects of the deformed grains in extruded aluminum. This analysis provides information which can be used in the die and process design to improve metal flow uniformity and therefore the microstructure of the final product. It also allows prevention of the typical extrusion defects like surface tearing.

VERTICAL ANODE CRACKING - THE VALCO EXPERIENCE</B>: <I>Norbert A. Ambenne</I>, Volta Alumium Company Ltd (VALCO), P.O. Box 625, Tema, Ghana, West Africa
<P>
During the period 1990 - 1995 the VALCO aluminum smelter experienced a serious anode cracking problem. Approximately 12 % of the anodes split mainly along a particular set of anode stubs. About half of these splits resulted in carbon pieces falling into the reduction cell with attendant operating difficulties. This cracking phenomenon started when the plant was converted from 41.5 to 48 inches longer anodes with the extra length added to one end of the anode. Results of the investigations revealed that several operating variables contributed to anode cracking in varying degrees. These factors include mix profile in anode former mold, anode stub-to-gap ratio, anode setting practices, pot condition, anode symmetry, and moisture content in anode aggregate.

AN APPROACH FOR A COMPLETE EVALUATION OF RESISTANCE OF A MATERIAL TO THERMAL SHOCK (PART 1): APPLYING TO THE CASES OF ANODES AND CATHODES: </B><I>Christian Dreyer</I>, Bernard Samanos, Aluminium Pechiney, LRF BP 114, 73303 Saint Jean de Maurienne, Cedex, France
<P>
The aim of this article is to describe a new method for characterizing a material in terms of resistance to thermal shock. Such characterization takes into account the criteria of thermal shock resistance to initiation (Kingery criterion) and propagation (Hasselman criteria). It can be applied equally well to hard or soft thermal shock. This new approach has the following main advantages : 1) characterization of the material in terms of thermal shock is complete, 2) thermal shock tests or empirical formulae, the validity of which are often hard to establish, become unnecessary. Examples of the use of this new approach are presented for anodes and cathodes.

This article presents in detail the steps taken to successfully resolve the problem of anode breakage due to thermal shock et ALBA. These steps can be essentially characterized as follows: 1) establishment of a method of accounting for anode breakages, 2) parametric studies on benchscale anodes, 3) effects on the process. Characterizing anodes in terms of resistance to thermal shock, following the method described in Part 1, allowed us to appreciate the importance of each of the adjustable parameters of the process. The applied solution draws on a new grain size distribution formulation.

Change of weight, density, permeability and porosity of anode specimens were measured after being baked to temperatures between 300 and 1250&#176;C. Test specimens were cut from a green anode and analysed prior to the baking to study green property variations. Density variations in the green anode were significant and influenced the permeability measured in the green specimens. In mathematical modeling of the baking process, anode property models for description of heat and mass transport phenomena in the anodes are required. As basis for the derivation of the property models, the anode was considered to be a composite medium consisting of pitch coke, filler coke and pores. The filler coke was divided into a coarse and fine size fraction. The fine fraction mix with the binder pitch to constitute the binder matrix. It was assumed that the binder matrix was uniformly distributed on the surface of the remaining coarse filler particles. The models were compared and verified against the data.

<P>
The minimization of anode carbon consumption in aluminium reduction cells has an important technical, environmental and economical impact. The basic anode elements, such as coke and pitch, do not always have the desired properties and there is an increasing need to protect the anodes against oxidation by air and CO2. A solution based on boric acid impregnation of the upper part of the anode has been tested at the industrial scale. Anodes have been impregnated using specially designed equipment to place the protection in the appropriate part of the anode and to avoid metal contamination. Results are shown for different levels of impregnation. Comparison to metal spraying protection is also analyzed.

UPDATE ON MOLTEN METAL INCIDENT REPORTING:</B> S.G. Epstein, The Aluminum Association Inc., 900 19th St., N.W., Washington, DC 20006
<P>
Millions of pounds of molten aluminum are handled every day, safely and without incident, in nearly every segment of the aluminum industry. However, there are inherent hazards in handling any molten material and explosions involving molten aluminum and water or other oxidizing contaminants continue to occur in plants throughout the world. While these are infrequent events that often result in little or no damage to equipment or injury to personnel, an awareness of the possible consequences of an explosion is critical to maintaining a safe casthouse. The aluminum industry has made an extensive effort to gain an understanding of molten metal explosions, the factors that promote them, and how they might be prevented. The effort has included laboratory studies, conducted over the past 45 years, and thorough investigations of plant incidents. As part of this effort, the Aluminum Association established in 1985 a world-wide molten metal incident reporting program to obtain and share information on plant incidents. Presently, there are more than 230 participants in the program representing about 300 plants located in about 20 countries. Findings from the nearly 1200 reports submitted to date are reviewed in this paper.

The aluminum industry has used Porter International 7001 (Tarset Std.) successfully as a protective coating in casting pits for over 20 years to prevent molten aluminum and water explosions until it was withdrawn from the market in 1994. The Aluminum Association contracted with Alcoa in 1995 to identify and test alternate coating materials which would be an acceptable replacement for Tarset Std. This paper will report the status of the program which was initiated in September 1995 and will be concluding in late 1996. Included in this paper are the screening and selection processes of the candidate coatings, results of initial molten aluminum/water explosion tests and the selection of the best performers for final explosion tests.

PROMOTING AWARENESS OF POTENTIAL HAZARDS IN ALUMINUM SCRAP: </B><I>D.C. Pierce</I>, C.H. Kenney, Reynolds Metals Company, 6601 West Broad Street, Richmond, VA 23261
<P>
There are a variety of potential safety hazards in any industrial activity and this includes the melting of aluminum scrap. The source of most hazards in scrap aluminum is the moisture or contamination that the scrap contains. Melting internal or purchased scrap remains the prevailing cause of molten metal incidents today. Everyone who handles scrap aluminum, from the first collection through to the melting, needs to be aware of the potential hazards. Facilities need to use a variety of approaches to increase safety awareness in all the operations. Scrap collectors, suppliers and brokers must be mindful of what the scrap hazards are, and the receiving plants must take steps to keep the hazards out of their casthouses. One of the new tools that plants have available is a fax-notification system operated by the Aluminum Association for information on scrap that has been rejected by another facility for safety or health reasons. This system is felt to offer an important safety enhancement, because scrap dealers have been known to resell unsafe scrap after it has been rejected. Although the Scrap Rejection Notification System is currently operational, its success will be measured by how infrequently it is needed.

NEW GUIDELINES FOR SOW CASTING AND MELTING:</B> G.N. Chaffin, Quality Challenges, Midlothian, VA 23112; J.E. Jacoby, Consultant, 3398 North Hills Road, Murrysville, PA 15668
<P>
The aluminum industry has experienced many incidents of explosions as a result of wet or contaminated sows being charged into molten metal. The presence of moisture in the cavity of a sow is often impossible to detect and therefore the sow is assumed to be safe. However, this undetected moisture can cause a serious explosion if it is submerged into molten aluminum. The Aluminum Association has prepared guidelines for sow casting, inspection and melting to help facilities protect themselves from the potential hazards associated with melting sows. The guidelines and this paper consider mold designs, casting, transportation &amp; storage, inspection and melting operations. Recommendations are offered which can be used in conjunction with each plant&#180s practices. The recommendations can help both the casting facility and the melting plant work toward a decrease in the possibility of an incident involving the melting of sows.

THE SEARCH FOR PROTECTIVE CLOTHING FOR WORKERS EXPOSED TO THE HAZARDS OF MOLTEN ALUMINUM AND MOLTEN BATH: </B><I>Ronald R. McHaney</I>, Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation
<P>
Burns are one of the leading causes of work injuries within the aluminum industry. Some physical and chemical properties of molten aluminum - low emissivity and viscosity - contribute to the potential for injury-producing incidents. Other properties, including high heat of fusion and shrinkage characteristics during cooling, add complexity to the task of identifying suitable protective clothing for workers exposed to the hazards of molten aluminum and bath. This presentation will address the initiative to identify protective clothing for workers exposed to those hazards and the progress that has been made including the development and application of the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) designation: F955, &quot;Standard Test Method for Evaluating Heat Transfer Through Materials for Protective Clothing Upon Contact with Molten Substances&quot;. In addition, I will discuss the need to consider worker comfort and the potential for heat stress in the selection process.

MODELLING OF SOLIDIFICATION IN Al-ALLOYS:</B> <I>Nigel Saunders,</I> Thermotech Ltd., The Surrey Research Park, Guildford GU2 5YG, and IRC in Materials for High Performance Applications, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom
<P>
Solidification in Al-alloys is a complex process usually occuring under non-equilibrium conditions with the possible formation of metastable low melting point eutectics and non-equilibrium phases. However, it has recently been shown that it is possible to use thermodynamic phase diagram calculations to simulate the non-equilibrium solidification of complex Al-alloys under so-called 'Scheil' conditions. Excellent results can be obtained for features such as fraction solid transformed as a function of temperature, phase formation, latent enthalpy and Cp of solidification etc. All of these features are important input into modelling of solidification processing particularly for software packages which simulate heat flow during casting. The paper will present the results of 'Scheil' simulations for a wide range of commercial Al-alloys showing comparison with experimental results for fraction solid transformed and phase formation. The use of subsequently derived Cp and heat evolution parameters in casting simulation packages will be discussed and examples of its application shown.

THE APPLICATION OF EFFICIENT PARALLEL PROCESSING TO FINITE ELEMENT MODELING OF FILLING, SOLIDIFICATION, AND DEFECT PREDICTION FOR ULTRA-LARGE SHAPE CASTINGS: </B><I>David Snyder</I>, Aluminum Company of America, Alcoa Technical Center, 100 Technical Drive, Alcoa Center, PA 15069; David Waite, Consultant, Coralville, IA; Alpesh Amin, HP/Convex Corporation, Atlanta, GA
<P>
Finite element modeling has become widely to used simulate the filling, solidification, and defect formation in casting processes. For extremely large, complex parts, typical of automotive structural applications, the high cost of tooling makes process modeling an extremely useful tool. However, as the size and complexity of casting part geometry increase, the computational requirements for modeling become formidable. To address the challenge for modeling ultra-large shape castings, a finite element code was developed to efficiently take advantage of shared-memory parallel computing systems. This paper gives a brief description of the mathematical models which describe the casting processes. The implementation of the models and the numerical issues regarding memory architecture, parsing of computations, cpu synchronization, and overhead minimization for parallel processing are discussed. Examples are presented for filling and solidification analyses of permanent mold, tilt-pour, and die casting models run on an 8-CPU HP/Convex SPP-1000 computer.

The low pressure casting process has an increasing popularity as it allows a rapid production of components close to the final &quot;near net shape&quot; with a very good casting yield. Depending on the property requirements of the final product, it is often necessary to control casting soundness. Internal porosity can cause a loss of pressure tightness, a critical factor in parts such as engine blocks and manifolds which are required to keep various gases and fluids. The development of criteria functions should allow the prediction of the thermal conditions required to maintain porosity below some critical predetermined level. In order to determine criteria functions, it is necessary to acquire thermal data during casting solidification. A low pressure casting machine and die were instrumented to obtain &quot;in situ&quot; thermal analysis curves during the solidification of flat plates of thickness varying from 1/8&quot; to 3/4&quot; in Sr modified and unmodified 6290, 356 and 319 alloys. The paper describes that effort and some of the results obtained.

A TECHNIQUE FOR THE ESTIMATION OF INSTANTANEOUS HEAT TRANSFER AT THE MOLD/METAL INTERFACE DURING CASTING:</B> Michael Trovant, <I>Stavros Argyropoulos</I>, Department of Metallurgy &amp; Materials Science, University of Toronto, 184 College Street, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3E4
<P>
Many current advancements responsible for improving the accuracy of solidification algorithms have resulted from the incorporation of additional complex casting related phenomena into the numerical calculation scheme. More recently, however, the proper specification of boundary conditions has been found to play a critical role in limiting model inaccuracy. Of particular interest to casting are the temperature boundary conditions, which when adopted by many models appear to be the most troublesome. Temperature boundary conditions can vary significantly with time and position along the face of the casting and accurate heat transfer coefficients are notoriously difficult to obtain experimentally for all points on the mold/metal interface, especially when the influence of thermal contraction is acknowledged. A novel technique which minimizes the error associated with selecting boundary conditions without experimentation is proposed. Advanced knowledge of the air gap formation and its correlation to the heat transfer coefficient at the mold/metal interface is used to formulate a coupled mathematical model which determines the increase of the air gap and predicts the instantaneous cooling conditions at a given mold wall. The objective is to allow the modeler to estimate effect of thermal contraction on the heat loss at mold/metal interfaces without resorting to experimentation.

MECHANISM OF DENDRITE FRAGMENTATION IN CASTINGS: </B><I>Shan Liu</I>, Shu-Zu Lu, A .Hellawell, Michigan Technological University, Dept. of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Houghton, MI 49931
<P>
A temperature gradient stage was designed with a controlled deceleration mechanism to simulate the columnar growth in castings/ingots where the growth velocities and temperature gradients at a dendritic front undergo a continuous decrease during solidification. Transparent materials of SCN-H2O and NH4Cl-H2O systems were used so that the solidification process with various decelerations could be directly observed and video recorded. It is observed that fragmentation of secondary arms is directly related to the deceleration and this provides an intrinsic resource for the formation of equiaxed grains in castings where convection may be available for transportation of the fragments to the open liquid. The responses of a dendritic array to the deceleration, including primary spacing adjustment and tip radius adjustment etc., are also observed and discussed.

Aluminum alloys can contain heterogenous impurities which will affect the strength of the final product and result in either failure during manufacture or in service. Pulsed ultrasound, conveyed down metal guide-rods from energized piezo-electric crystals, is passed into the liquid metal and reflections from any impurities can be recorded by special counting devices. Small particles of the order of 10 to 15 &#181;m can be resolved and their behaviour such as in settling recorded. Sequential tests using particles of identified size and distribution such as SiC and TiAl3 demonstrated the systems reproducibility. Such changes in composition resulting from imposed turbulent transfer with the associated pick up of very small oxide particles could also be shown. The effect of &quot;sludge&quot; formation such as that found in die-casting applications due to intermetallic phase precipitation could also be measured. This could be of value in process control of die casting systems. The developed system is adaptable to on line quality measurement and the recording of molten aluminum cleanliness in crucibles, ladles, furnace wells, launders and other transfer systems.

FRACTAL ANALYSIS: POROSITY IN ALUMINUM CAST ALLOY:</B> Bo-Tao Lee, <I>Shu-Zu Lu</I>, A. Hellawell, Michigan Technological University, Dept. of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Houghton, MI 49931
<P>
Porosity is a very common defect in Al-Si cast alloy. To examine the porosity, a fractal analysis was conducted to characterize the pores using two numbers, Fractal Dimension, D, and Shape Factor, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">. This analysis was based on the measurement of perimeters/areas of all individual pores using an image analyzer with changing magnifications. The result indicates that two types of pores, i.e., rough/shrinkage pores and smooth/hydrogen pores, can be distinguished by these fractal numbers. The shrinkage pores show a larger value of fractal dimensions whereas the hydrogen pores have a fractal dimension close to one. Combined with analysis for silicon particles, it is suggested numerically that shrinkage pores are more likely associated with the silicon phase that is not well modified, showing a rather coarse flake structure, and the hydrogen pores are in the regions where modification was well done with fine silicon particles.

<P>
Semisolid Metal Processing is gaining interest very rapidly. This manufacturing approach offers distinct advantages over other near-net-shape technologies, like a more homogenous microstructure and less porosity and thus excellent mechanical properties. A perfect control of the die filling during processing is however necessary, especially in the case of semisolid forming of aluminum, where a non-controlled die filling can lead to oxide inclusions. Numerical simulation would be a powerful tool, as it would allow to predict die filling and the optimization of die design. However, the constitutive behaviour of such semisolid metals is rather complex. Their non-Newtonian behaviour does not depend only on the volume fraction of liquid, but also on the metal&#180s history prior to processing and the processing conditions. In this paper, a Bingham power-law relation is presented, capable of describing correctly the rheological behaviour of the semisolid metal. This constitutive equation is then introduced in a modified version of the casting simulation package SIMULOR. Simulation results on the filling of a 2-D cavity under various conditions are shown. Issues related to die design of dies, using numerical simulation will also be addressed.

<P>
A cast aluminum matrix composite based on an Al-Si-Mg alloy has been developed. The reinforcement was in the form of hollow microspheres, a ceramic by-product from coal power stations. The particles were incorporated into the aluminum alloy melt by mechanical stirring either in the semisolid state or full liquid state. The composite melt was cast from full liquid temperature to produce slugs for thixoforming. A variety of compositions, reinforcement volume fractions and processing parameters were used. The as-cast microstructure consisted of fine, equiaxed dendritic primary grains in a matrix of secondary grains and eutectic phases. The primary dendritic grains evolved to become non-dendritic after reheating the slugs to semisolid temperature. The slugs were subsequently thixoformed at a temperature corresponding to a primary solid fraction of about 50% into thin plates and alternator pulleys. Special wear tests on the pulleys showed that they were comparable to steel pulleys. The material is potentially suitable for those applications demanding good wear resistance, light weight and low cost.

The mechanical behavior of nanocrystalline intermetallic and multiphase materials has been investigated using disk bend, tensile, and compression techniques. Materials such as NiAl, TiAl, Al-Al3Zr, and Cu-SiOx were synthesized by the gas-condensation technique using electron beam heating. Disk bend tests of nanocrystalline NiAl and TiAl showed evidence of improve ductility at room temperature in these normally extremely brittle materials. In contrast, tensile tests of multiphase nanocrystalline Al-Al3Zr samples showed significant increases in strength, but substantial reductions in ductility with decreasing grain size. Results from compression tests of nanocrystalline Cu and Cu-SiOx will also be described. Implications for the operable deformation mechanisms in these materials will be discussed. *This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, BES-Materials Science, under Contract W-31-109-Eng-38, the Alcoa Corporation, and by AFOSR Grant # FY9620-92-J.

<P>
Different processing routes can vary the internal structure of nanocrystalline compacts. As a result a single grain size measurement is insufficient to interpret mechanical property results. Blind comparison between samples with different processing histories may be hazardous since their internal structures (grain size distribution, grain boundary character, pore size distribution, adsorbed or chemically bonded impurities) are shown to vary. In particular, annealing samples to grow the grain size for producing Hall-Petch plots is shown to drastically change the pore size distribution and density in powder compacted samples that are not outgasssed prior to compaction. Improvements in processing, particularly compaction procedure, are illustrated by microscopy, XRD, SANS, PGAA, FNAA, archimedes density, and indentation tests. It is shown that with care and knowledge of the process inert gas condensed and compacted samples can be produced with few extrinsic defects.

An important aspect of the processing&lt;&#173;&gt;microstructure&lt;&#173;&gt;property relationships is the characterization of nanocrystalline structures by x-ray diffraction. The Williamson-Hall analysis is often used to deconvolute the line broadening effects of grain size and residual stress. In this study, Cu/Cu2O nanocrystalline films were produced by electro deposition. This technique produces a composite structure consisting of pure Cu and Cu2O grains each with diameters in the range of 10 to 20 nm. Electro deposited films were characterized by x-ray diffraction to determine both grain size and residual stress. The Williamson-Hall analysis was tested by direct measurement of the grain size by TEM and by using thermal treatments to vary the state of residual stress in the films.

The double cantilever beam (DCB) test is widely used to characterize the mode I delamination and bridging behavior of laminated continuous fiber composite materials. Many composite systems exhibit significant large scale fiber bridging that is not included in the derivation of the analysis methods. The bridging contribution to fracture energy is statistical in nature. A comparison is made of several analysis methods for applicability to systems exhibiting significant fiber bridging. A general DCB analysis method is described that takes into account loading pin effects, material orthotropy, crack root inelasticity, and large scale deformation behind the crack faces.

HYGRO-MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF A CLASS OF SWELLING-TYPE THREE-DIMENSIONALLY BRAIDED COMPOSITES: </B>Surya R. Kalidindi, Abdel Abusaifeh, Materials Engineering Department Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA 19104
<P>
A new class of swelling-type composite materials using three-dimensionally braided graphite or Kevlar fibers have been designed and processed for potential applications in bone implants. These composites derive their swelling from the hydrophillic nature of the matrix material used in their production. A combined experimental and modeling study was undertaken to study the hygro-mechanical behavior of this class of materials. The properties of interest included the swelling strains, elastic properties, yield strengths, and impact strengths. Note that these properties for the braided composites are highly anisotropic. Furthermore, the mechanical properties are strongly affected by the amount of absorbed water. Cylindrical samples of braided composites were produced with varying fiber volume fractions, braid angles, fiber type (graphite and Kevlar), matrix cross-linking (to control the degree of swelling in the composite), and fiber architecture (uniaxial, rectangular braided, and circular braided). Swelling strains at saturation were measured in these samples. Simple compression tests were performed on these samples in at least two principal material directions in both dry and saturated conditions. Elastic moduli and yield strengths were extracted from these tests. Cylindrical samples of the matrix material (without fibers) were also produced and utilized to fully characterize the hygro-mechanical behavior of the matrix material. Constitutive models have been proposed to predict the various hygro-mechanical properties of the 3-D braided composites in both dry and saturated states as a function of the fiber and matrix properties, fiber volume fraction, and fiber orientations. A weighted average of the currently employed isostrain and isostress models in literature for this class of materials was found to consistently yield better predictions for the anisotropic elastic moduli, when compared to the predictions of either of these models. The weighting factor was found to be dependent primarily on the fiber and matrix materials (i.e. independent of the type of loading, fiber volume fraction, and fiber orientation) and has been interpreted as an interaction parameter between the various fiber and matrix systems. These models were then extended to predict the swelling behavior and yield strengths of the 3-D braided composites. The accuracies of the proposed models were evaluated by comparisons against experimental measurements described above as well as the predictions from a finite element simulation of the response of a representative unit-cell of the braided composite. These comparisons revealed that the proposed models are reasonably accurate in their predictions.

A critical component of a prototype coating system being developed to protect molybdenum against high temperature oxidation (i.e. at 1600&#176;C for 500 hours) is a functionally graded layer based on MoSi2 + x SiC (where x is the variable mole fraction of SiC in the film). Different approaches for synthesizing composite films include sputtering from elemental or compound targets, reactive sputtering, and direct sputtering of composite targets. This paper will explore the feasibility of synthesizing composite films by RF magnetron sputtering of a composite target. Results of compositional depth profiling using Auger Electron Spectroscopy, microstructural evaluation and X-Ray diffraction analyses of the films will be presented. In particular, the diffusion of silicon and carbon in to the substrate will be characterized using a &quot;ball-cratering&quot; technique followed by auger electron spectroscopy (AES). This technique will help to overcome the disadvantages associated with ion-beam sputtering during depth profiling (e.g. different sputter yields for the constituent elements, interface broadening effects, etc.).

EFFECT OF COMBINED LOADING ON CRACK-TIP DEFORMATION IN GRAPHITE/EPOXY COMPOSITES:</B> M.A. Seif, C.M. Hargrove, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL 36088
<P>
An experimental investigation of the crack displacement and failure modes of graphite/epoxy plates [0/&#177;45/90]2s under tensile loading with central cracks at various angles (15&#176;, 30&#176;, 60&#176;, 75&#176;, and 90&#176;) was carried out. A mixed mode state of stresses developed at the center of the crack as a result of the crack orientation. Laser Speckle technique, a high sensitive noncontact technique, was employed to measure Crack Opening Displacement (COD) and Crack Shearing Displacement (CSD) of the crack emanating from the normal and tangential stresses at the crack center. Damage zones of the material at different crack orientation were examined and evaluated. The critical stress intensity factors for mode I and mode II were obtained from COD and CSD at failure. Detail studies were performed to investigate the behavior of the material during loading application and the effect of the angles on the stress distribution. The data obtained were compared with the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) solutions. The comparisons suggested a correlation within &#177;8 percent deviation. It was concluded from this investigation that the theoretical analysis could be applied to obtain the fracture properties of graphite/epoxy composites.

INCREASING THE OFF-AXIS AND MONOLITHIC STRENGTHS IN CONTINUOUS FIBER REINFORCED ALUMINUM MATRIX COMPOSITES:</B> <I>Colin McCullough</I>, Paul R. Nisson*, Steven R. Pittman Bill E. Birkholz, MMC Program, 3M Company, St. Paul, MN 55144-1000; *3M/MMC Production Plant, Middleway, WV 25430
<P>
Tremendous progress has been made in the properties of aluminum alloys reinforced with 60-70 vol. % of continuous alumina fibers, with tensile strengths routinely averaging 250 ksi (1.7 GPa) in the longitudinal direction. The choice of matrix and its resulting microstructure is critical in obtaining such strengths and the matrices used at 3M to date are a pure Al and an Al-2%Cu alloy. This leads to design considerations in composite performance (transverse and shear strengths) and in any unreinforced areas. To date, the pure Al and Al-2%Cu matrix composites have transverse strengths of 25 ksi (170 MPa) and 40 ksi (275 MPa) respectively. While these values have applications, higher strengths may be desirable. Also unreinforced areas could benefit greatly from higher yield strengths. Use of traditional higher strength alloys is seriously restricted due to both the reactivity with the fiber and their segregation behavior which dramatically reduces longitudinal strength. How ever a new aluminum alloy matrix composition promises to combine all the desired features of the matrix. Data will be presented showing retention of high longitudinal strengths while also achieving much higher transverse and monolithic strengths. The specifics of this system will be discussed as well as directions for optimization.

<P>
Aluminum-based particulate composites have potential application in services requiring high strength combined with low density. We have used mechanical alloying followed by hot isostatic pressing (HIPing) to fabricate a series of Al-Si-C particulate composites. Pure Al or Al-Si eutectic powder was mixed with graphite and SPEX milled for varying times. Consolidation of the mechanically alloyed powders was done by HIPing at 180MPa (26 ksi) which resulted in a fully dense composite. Aluminum carbide (Al4C3) is formed during consolidation. Formation of SiC is a possibility as well. Maximum hardnesses following HIPing correspond to an approximate yield strength of 990 MPa (144 ksi). Properties as they depend upon processing conditions and the resulting microstructure are discussed. This work was supported by the Army Research Office.

Thermomechanical processing to produce the HSRS for the SiC/6061 Al alloy composite fabricated by a vortex method before squeeze casting and extrusion was investigated. The SiC/6061 A1 composites hot-rolled in rolling strain per passes of 0.05~0.3 and at 573K indicate the m value of 0.4~0.6 and the total elongation of 200~300% in the strain rate of 0.08~1.3 s-1 and at 853K. The total elongations of the composite hot-rolled at 523 and 623K decrease to less than 150%. The flow stress of the composite heat treated by T6 after rolling increased and the total elongation decreased as compared with those of the composite without T6 due to reaction between SiC and matrix. The fracture surface of the composite has a partially liquid phase and filaments and it is thought that an interfacial sliding at the liquid phase contributes to the HSRS in addition to grain boundary sliding in the SiC/6061 Al composite fabricated by a vortex method.

COMPATIBILITY OF SEVERAL REINFORCEMENTS WITH Ti-Al AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPOSITES:</B> Chikura Fujiwara, Nagoya Aerospace Systems Works, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., 10, Oye-Cho, Minato-Ku, Nagoya, 455 Japan
<P>
Titanium aluminide matrix composites have received considerable attention due to their potential to have high specific strength and stiffness at high temperature. And SiC fibers are considered to be promising candidates for reinforcement of the composites. SiC/TiAl composites, however, are difficult to be fabricated in good state because of severe reactions at the interface being taken place during fabrication process. One of the most effective means to suppress the excessive reaction is to apply the diffusion barrier coating on the surface of SiC fiber. Another solution to fabricate a TiAl matrix composite is to apply the reinforcement which has good compatibility with matrix, TiAl. Several candidates for diffusion barrier coating between SiC fiber and TiAl were evaluated, then W and HfC showed excellent effects on suppress excessive interfacial reaction, while other candidates such as Al2O3, Zr, B2, Ce2O3 were not effective. Based on these results, a desirable interface model of organic polymer derived SiC reinforced TiAl composite is proposed. Other fibers were evaluated as reinforcements of TiAl matrix composites. Then it was found that W, W-Re, Re were good in compatibility with TiAl and consolidated with TiAl in good state. As a result, W-3%Re/TiAl showed 680 Mpa at 1373K.

The tensile and high cycle fatigue properties of the composites were found to be much superior to those of the unreinforced matrix.

A process which combines fiber coating and particles hybridizing together has been utilized for the structural optimization of carbon fiber reinforced aluminum matrix composite. SiC coating was derived by Sol-gel method and SiC particle hybridizing was processed in Sol-gel solution simultaneously. Squeeze-cast process was used to get bulk composite materials. SEM analysis of the material showed a well fiber distribution in Al matrix by particles hybridizing. Mechanical properties of the composite were improved especially for the axial strength. HRTEM research indicated the coating to be an effective barrier of the interface reaction.

FLIP CHIP SOLDER INTERCONNECTIONS--A RELIABILITY PERSPECTIVE: </B><I>Karl Puttlitz,</I> IBM Microelectronics, B/330-1AX44-173, GFKA, Rt. 52, Hopewell Junction, NY 12533
<P>
The solder ball flip chip or so-called C-4 connection was introduced by IBM nearly three decades ago as an alternative to manual wire bonding whose productivity and reliability were not acceptable at the time. A very large data base indicates that flip chips are the most reliable interconnection scheme in the industry since its inception. Moreover, the combination of C-4 mounted die and alumina multilayer ceramic (MLC) substrates provided the highest overall package reliability. This paper will discuss several key technical attributes such the joint controlled collapse feature, self-centering and throughput which is independent of die I/O count. Joint design, process, compositional and metallurgical factors will be discussed in the context of the very significant effect they have on reliability as well. Flip chip technology is flexible, having been successfully utilized with several generations of chip carriers. Important also is the ability to predict the thermal-mechanical (fatigue) behavior of C-4 joints. When attached to ceramic carriers, the failure rate of flip chip joints obey a distance-from-neutral point (DNP) dependence defined by the Coffin-Manson (C-M) relationship. Modifications to the C-M relationship necessary for this application will also be discussed. It will be shown that the technology is sufficiently extendible to satisfy the trends of smaller, lighter, faster, denser, etc. which are expected to continue in the future. New developments such as chip underfill and future trends including DCA and their reliability implications will also be discussed.

A NEW RELIABILITY ASPECT OF HIGH DENSITY INTERCONNECTIONS: </B> <I>Jorma Kivilahti</I>, Helsinki University of Technology, Materials and Manufacturing in Electronics, Vuorimiehentie 2A, Fin-02150 Espoo, Finland
<P>
Increasing importance of portability in telecommunication and consumer electronics is activating the research and development work on reliable, cost-effective fine-pitch interconnections and substrate technology alternatives. However, high density interconnections may produce increasing difficulties, e.g. in paste printing, component alignment and acceptable residual levels. Moreover, increasing microjoint densities are related to decreasing solder joint volumes, and therefore, it is even more likely that the whole solder volume will take part in the reactions, for example, between a solder, Flip Chip (FC) bump and substrate metallisation. Similar consequences of the miniaturization are encountered in the bump-limiting metallurgy; the total volumes (or thicknesses) of the diffusion barriers and adhesion layers and the original filler, alike, can transform into the matrix of intermetallics, which due to their inherent brittleness make the microjoints mechanically too weak to withstand thermal stresses. Accordingly, for confirming adequate reliability of microjoints it is essential to have better understanding and control on <I>metallurgical compatability</I> of dissimilar materials being in contact with each other. In this communication results of metallurgical studies on various FC bump-solder-substrate metallization reactions are presented. As specific examples, the bump-solder-substrate interactions have been studied experimentally with Au- as well as with Ni-bumped test chips, which were reflow-soldered with the eutectic SnPbAg filler at 235&#176;C for various times onto Au/Ni- and Cu-conductors on the FR-4 substrates. The electrical properties, structural integrity and evolution of microstructures (i.e., intermetallics, Pb-rich solution or eutectic structure) of reflow-soldered Flip Chip joints were examined in detail with the conventional tests and materials characterization methods. For studying the metallurgical compatibility and controlling the reaction kinetics between Au, Ni and eutectic SnPb and SnPbAg, the wedge-shaped diffusion couple experiments which more clearly illustrate the effect of solder layer thickness on the volume fraction of the intermetallics in the microjoints, were conducted using the RMA flux as well as a vacuum furnace. The thermodynamics of the AuSnPb, NiSnPb and CuSnPb systems were critically modeled and used for rationalizing the observed bump-solder-substrate reactions in the Flip Chip joints as well as in the diffusion couples. On the basis of metallurgical considerations a new Pb-free solution to this &quot;small-volume-problem&quot; is also addressed.

The optical transmitter and receiver modules were fabricated by applying flip chip bonding process. It was possible that the degree of alignment accuracy controlled below 1 &#181;m by the force of solder self-alignment. To minimize parasitic capacitance and inductance induced from the solder joint, the reflowed solder ball on Si substrate was varied from 100 &#181;m to 5 &#181;m. The Pb-In, Pb-Sn, In-Sn and In-Ag alloys as the bonding materials were deposited above UBM on the Si substrate by using thermal evaporation method. During the reflowing process, the behavior of solder ball formation, and the intermetallic compounds between the UBM and solder composition were inspected with various heating rates and the use of flux. During the flip chip bonding process, the solder joint shape and the gap between Si substrate and optical devices were controlled by means of a various temperature profiles and bonding force. The solder joints reliability of the flip chip bonded optical submodules were evaluated by shear, thermal shock, and thermal cycling test. In the case of the thermal shock test, the range of temperature was from 25&#176;C to the liquid N2. Thermal cycling numbers were 1000 cycles from -40&#176;C to 120&#176;C. These samples were analyzed by optical microscopy, SEM/EDS and TEM.

RELIABILITY CHALLENGES AND MODELING OF MINIATURIZED SOLDERED ASSEMBLIES:</B> <I>Jean-Paul Clech</I>, EPSI Inc., P.O. Box 1522, Montclair, NJ 07042
<P>
Miniaturized electronic packages have emerged that bring about new reliability challenges and, in some cases, have revived the concerns of Leadless Chip Carriers (LCCCs) on organic substrates: 1) most of these packages are leadless; 2) their Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) is low because of the high silicon contents of shrinking or disappearing packages; 3) the assembled packages may have a low stand-off height (for miniaturization purposes); 4) typical assemblies are very fine-pitch with micro-solder joints having smaller load bearing or crack propagation areas than conventional surface mount assemblies. The above attributes may be detrimental to long term solder joint integrity and suggest that reliability be looked at carefully, more so than with conventional surface mount assemblies. This talk will present thermal stress and reliability models that can help tackle those problems and ensure that assembly reliability is built-in during the early stages of product design. Two examples of engineering models of miniaturized assemblies will be discussed that enable rapid assessment of the impact of package geometry and materials on assembly reliability. The first example is a model of flip-chip assemblies with underfill. The model quantifies the solder joint relief provided by the underfill layer and its effect on assembly stiffness. The mechanics of flip-chip with underfill are unique since they involve an increase in assembly stiffness to provide for solder joint strain relief. The analysis is that of a multilayer structure (board/underfill/die) that deforms under thermal loads and 'external' forces and moments exerted by the solder joints. Predicted shear strains in the underfill layer are in good agreement with moir&eacute; measurements. In the limiting case where the shear modulus of the encapsulant is very low, the model converges to Hall's axisymmetric model for conventional LCCC assemblies. The analysis also gives interfacial stress distributions, a useful feature to assess whether the encapsulant/die and substrate interfaces are overstressed. Various parametric studies are conducted showing that the encapsulant modulus must be high enough to provide adequate strain relief in the solder joints, in agreement with experimental results and advanced finite element studies. Increasing the encapsulant modulus stiffens the assembly, because of mechanical coupling between the die and substrate, but the increased stiffness is overshadowed by much larger reductions in the solder joint strains. The second example is that of a micro-BGA construction where a compliant elastomer layer provides for decoupling between the die and substrate. The package is modeled as a multilayer structure (dielectric film/elastomer/die) where the low modulus elastomer layer behaves like an adhesive bond in shear. The analysis enables tailoring the compliant layer (modulus and thickness) to achieve targeted assembly reliability goals. Both mechanical models capture the reliability impact of the design parameters and materials in a quantitative manner. They can be easily implemented as PC-based design-for-reliability tools to conduct parametric studies on chip, board and assembly parameters.

<P>
Chip-scale package family for silicon products can be combined to help the engineer and designer meet the most demanding goals for electronic miniaturization,. The significant advantage to employing the miniature Chip-Scale Packaging (CSP) technology is three-fold: higher component density, more efficient assembly automation and enhanced product performance. Bare or unpacked die may be considered for miniaturization, however, a significant advantage a packaged device has over bare die is the ability to test and screen the product before surface mount technology, chip-scale BGA devices have proved efficient, rugged and easily adapted to existing high volume SMT manufacturing processes. Of primary concern to anyone utilizing a new technology is finished product reliability. In this paper, the author will describe several chip-scale device structures, the operational environments they are expected to withstand and the results of, long-term thermal stress testing of the 46 I/O &#181;BGA Flash Memory packages that have been reflow solder attached to conventional laminated circuit structures. Topics covered include: Standards for CSP Technology, Assembly Process Methods, Defining Product Use Environment, Planning the Assembly Test Strategy. Although many of the products being introduced in the miniature chip scale package are compatible with existing surface mount assembly processes, the contact size and pitch are relatively small. And although high assembly yields have been achieved, developing a reliable product using chip-scale devices requires uniform solder paste printing and continued assembly process monitoring.

Encapsulant materials for flip chip on board assemblies were developed to address the issues of thermal mismatch between the various materials used in this assembly methodology. Several experimental encapsulant materials with enhanced flow properties, shorter cure schedules, and lower stresses have been studied for their effect on manufacturability and their behavior as a compliant structure surrounding the solder joints. Materials characterization studies were performed on the various encapsulants to determine the glass transition temperatures (Tg), tensile elastic and loss modulii (E' and E''), flow profiles, coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), radii of curvature, stress relaxation as functions of temperature and moisture, and apparent strengths of adhesion. In addition, reliability tests were conducted using FR4 substrates populated with die and underfilled with the various encapsulants to determine the relationship between materials properties and, package and solder joint reliability responses.

<P>
Low-energy (10-100 eV) ion and hyperthermal neutral irradiation during filmgrowth from the vapor phase are used to provide new chemical reaction pathways, modify film growth kinetics, and, hence, controllably alter film properties. During low-temperature epitaxial growth from hyperthermal Si beams, critical epitaxial thicknesses were increased by up to an order of magnitude over those obtained with MBE due to enhanced interlayer mass transport and more effective filling of interisland trenches. For heteroepitaxial Si1-xGex growth on Si(001), AFM and XTEM studies show that strain-induced roughening, which occurs at elevated growth temperatures, is strongly suppressed at Ts between 300 and 400&#176;C, with no indication of low-temperature kinetic roughening. The use of low-energy primary- ion beam sources in which ion energy and ion/neutral flux ratios can be varied independently during the growth of Al, Cu, and TiN polycrystalline layers on SiO2 will be shown to provide dramatic differences in nucleation rates, mosaicity, preferred orientation, strain, and microstructure evolution.

Using glancing-angle ion bombardment for surface modification rather than conventional near-normal incidence ions has the advantages of reducing damage and implantation projected ranges, reducing channeling, reducing sputtering, and preferentially removing surface asperities leading to flat surfaces. The effect of bombardment conditions on the surface morphology and perfection of GaAs(001), InP(001) and Si(001) surfaces are reported. Air-exposed surfaces were cleaned and smoothened to near atomic flatness without damage for optimal conditions: for example, with GaAs this was observed for 1000 eV Ar ions incident at 15&#176; from the surface plane at a dose of 2x1016 ions/cm2. For a given set of bombardment conditions, ion damage (observed as small dislocation loops in a 20-30 nm thick surface layer) decreased with decreasing ion incidence angle, and was eliminated below a critical angle. Sputtering yield, measured using film thicknesses and changes in reflection high-energy electron diffraction oscillations, decreased with decreasing incidence angle. The low sputtering yield and minimal damage make a glancing-angle geometry ideal for real-time characterization by ion scattering spectroscopy. Surface composition measurements on single monolayers of InAs on GaAs showed that the glancing-angle Ar beam did not did not measureably change the In coverage over relatively long times.

INFLUENCE OF PROCESSING PARAMETERS ON THE STABILITY OF MAGNETRON SPUTTERED DEPOSITED GROUP VI THIN FILMS:</B> <I> M.J. O'Keefe</I>, Avionics Directorate, Wright Laboratory, WPAFB, OH 45433
<P>
Sputter deposition of metallic thin films is commonly used to fabricate electrically conducting contacts and interconnects on semiconductor devices. For military applications, the stability of the patterned metal under adverse environmental conditions, such as prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures, can significantly influence the reliability of the device. In this investigation the influence of magnetron sputter deposition processing parameters on the stress, adhesion, resistivity and crystal structure Group VI (i.e.. Cr, Mo, W) thin films was studied. The influence of elevated temperature on the stability of the films was evaluated, in part, using a Tencor Flexus-2900 thin film stress measurement system. Results from the study indicate that minor changes in processing conditions can significantly affect the as-deposited and elevated temperature properties of the films.

<P>
The Stranski-Krastanov growth morphology of heteroepitaxy consists of three dimensional islands that nucleate on top of a few strained layers of film material that wet the substrate. It is well understood on the basis of energetic considerations that such islands can be entirely free of misfit dislocations, i.e., coherent, until they grow rather large. But the kinetic processes that govern their formation are far less clear. Motivated by recent scanning tunnelling microscopy studies of this phenomenon for Ge/Si(111), InAs/GaAs(001), and InSb/GaAs(001), we present a combination of atomistic Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field rate theory designed to reveal the kinetic pathways to coherent islands. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of interface alloying and the dynamics of the wetting layers.

MORPHOLOGICAL INSTABILITIES AND EVOLUTION OF THIN FILMS:</B> H. Wong, P.W. Voorhees, M.J. Miksis, S.H. Davis, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208
<P>
The driving force for morphological evolution of thin films increases as the size of the films decreases. Thus, to further miniaturize microelectronic and optoelectronic devices, the morphological instability and evolution of thin films need to be understood. We study the linear instability of two film shapes commonly encountered in experiment: a strip on a substrate, and a hole in a uniform film on a substrate. We assume that the instability is driven by capillarity and the film evolves via surface diffusion. The contact angle is fixed at a value between 0 and 180 degree. We find that both film shapes are unstable to certain disturbances. We also simulate numerically the evolution of the film shapes triggered by an unstable disturbance to reveal new stable steady states. The implications of these results on the long term stability of solid-film devices will be discussed. *Supported by NSF and DOE.

FATIGUE AND FRACTURE OF TiAl PST CRYSTALS:</B> <I>Y. Umakoshi</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565 Japan
<P>
Orientation and temperature dependences of cyclic hardening, fatigue life and fracture mode of TiAl PST crystals were investigated. Deformation twins and vein-like structure containing high density of ordered dislocations were formed below 500&#176;C depending on the type of ordered domain in the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> phase. The vein-like structure was responsible for strong cyclic hardening, while deformation twins were formed at the initial stage of fatigue and did not contribute the hardening. Formation of twins and vein-like structure was suppressed at 700&#176;C and fatigue life rapidly decreased showing cyclic softening. Deformation twins produced extrusions on the specimen surface and played an important role for crack initiation and fatigue failure. Effect of additional third elements such as V and Nb on the cyclic hardening and fatigue life will also be presented.

<P>
The fatigue mechanisms in a TiAl alloy heat-treated to the lamellar and equiaxed microstructures were studied to determine the effects of microstructure on the initiation of microcracks and their subsequent growth into large cracks. The results indicated microcracks initiated at grain/colony boundaries and at slip bands. Most microcracks were arrested after nucleation, but a few grew at K below the large crack thresholds. The populations of non-propagating and propagating cracks varied with life fractions. Ligaments in the wake of a fatigue crack were prone to fatigue failure. The destruction of the crack-wake ligaments resulted in lower fracture resistance in materials under cyclic loading than those under monotonic loading. *Supported by the AFWL Materials Directorate through Contract No. F33615-92-C-5951.

MICROMECHANICS OF FATIGUE AND FRACTURE IN LAMELLAR TiAl:</B> <I>Bimal K. Kad</I>, Robert J. Asaro, Department of Applied Mechanics &amp; Engineering Science, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093
<P>
Finite element based numerical procedures, incorporating physically based crystal plasticity models, are employed to study the evolution of non-uniform deformation, under monotonic and fully reversed (R=-1) cyclic loadings, in lamellar TiAl microstructures. The impetus for such efforts is to gather fundamental insight into microstructure sensitive deformation mechanisms, and to extract additional information, not obtainable from traditional mechanical property measurements. Such an effort is particularly desirable to help track various aspects of plastic anisotropy of specific layers, and microconstituents as implicit in polycrystalline aggregates. Computational efforts are directed to address constant strain, as well as constant stress amplitude loading schemes in the low cycle fatigue regime. Irreversible deformation twinning effects are fully accounted for in the fatigue maximum of 100 cycles. We will present several examples of experimentally observed, and numerically computed results, to identify hot spots for strain localization in monotonic and fully reversed loadings, and prescribe microstructural remedies to alleviate such effects.

MICROCRACK NUCLEATION AND PROPAGATION IN TiAl:</B> <I>Zhe Jin</I>, George T. Gray III, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545

Microcrack nucleation and propagation in a PST-TiAl crystal and a duplex <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl alloy at high and quasi-static strain rates and temperatures from 196&#176;C to 1200&#176;C was investigated under compression loading. In PST crystals, two microcracking habit planes, the {110} planes for translamellar cracking and the (111) interface plane for interlamellar cracking, were observed when the &lt;110&gt; directions in the lamellar interfaces were perpendicular to the loading direction. However, three microcracking habit planes were observed when the &lt;321&gt; directions in the lamellar interfaces were perpendicular to the loading direction. Most microcracks were found to nucleate at/near the lamellar interfaces and propagate into the laths along their habit planes to form translamellar cracks. In the fine-grained duplex microstructure, both grain interior microcracks and grain boundary microcracks were observed. The grain interior microcracks occurred primarily within the equiaxed grains and appeared to be formed by shear displacements along the maximum shear planes. An attempt to correlate the microcrack formation with the crystal deformation modes and crystal orientations is made and the microcrack nucleation and propagation mechanisms in TiAl are analyzed.

DAMAGE MODELING OF GAMMA TITANIUM ALUMINIDES:</B> <I>M.J. Pfuff</I>, B.U. Wittkowsky, GKSS-Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH and SFB 371, Institut f&uuml;r Werkstofforschung, Max-Planck-Str., D-211502 Geesthacht, Germany
<P>
A common feature of Gamma Titanium Aluminides is the heterogeneous character of their microstructure. This heterogeneity causes failure processes to be progressive, with a continuous transition between a diffused and a localized mode of damage, the relative contribution of both modes to failure being determined by the degree of randomness of microstructural heterogeneity. At room temperature the failure is preceded by the formation of microcracks which control the strain to failure either by microcrack coalescing or by the nucleation of a critical-size crack. The size and local distributions of microcracks reflect the heterogeneity of microstructure, and depend on stress state, size and geometry of the specimens. The results of model calculations are presented, which are based on mesoscale lattice of beams models used in statistical physics in order to treat the relationships between microcracking and failure. A comparison of the numerical results to the experimental findings emphasizes the significant role microstructural heterogeneity plays during the failure process of Titanium Aluminides.

LARGE-SCALE MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL FRACTURE IN A <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma-bold.gif">-TiAl ALLOY:</B> <I>S.J. Zhou</I>, D.M. Beazley, P.S. Lomdahl, B.L. Holian, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
We have carried out new large-scale molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of fracture in a titanium-aluminum alloy, using the methods we developed in previous MD simulations, where we studied dislocation emission from a crack in a three-dimensional thin film of embedded- atom-method copper, comprising 35 million atoms. In that first study, we observed a variety of dislocation emission modes in a sample that was sufficiently thick that we could be sure that the results did not depend on the thickness. The sequence of dislocation emission in the crack blunting process strongly depends on the crystallographic orientation of the crack front and differs strikingly from anything previously conjectured. This finding is essential to establish a precise dislocation emission criterion (i.e. intrinsic ductility criterion). We will report on similar calculations for the TiAl system, with emphasis on the crack-tip plasticity and interaction between a crack and lamellar interfaces.

Atomistic simulations of fracture in L1o TiAl were carried out using EAM interatomic potentials and molecular statics. We studied the behaviour of semi-infinite cracks under mode I loading in different crack-tip orientations. From the [1-10](111) crack tips we observed extensive dislocation emission, involving the formation of several planar faults, such as APB, CSF and SISF. We found that the edge dislocations with 1/2[110] Burgers vector that were emitted from [001](110) cracks were very compact and mobile. No planar fault formation was involved in the dislocation emission from this crack geometry. Cracks with [001](100) orientation were observed to cleave near the Griffith value of loading in a purely brittle manner.

ON THE CORRELATION BETWEEN MECHANISMS OF PLASTICITY AND FRACTURE IN Ti-48 AT.% Al ALLOYS</B>: <I>J.M.K. Wiezorek</I>, P.M. DeLuca, M.J. Mills, H.L. Fraser, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210
<P>
The technologically most relevant two-phase (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2) TiAl compounds contain a significant volume fraction of morphologically lamellar grains. Interestingly, a change in the predominant fracture mode has been observed from transgranular at room temperature to intergranular at elevated temperature for both equiaxed and duplex microstructures. It has previously been suggested that the segregation of alloying additions and/or impurities to grain boundaries during exposure at elevated temperature could be responsible for this change in fracture characteristics. However, the origin for the observed fracture mode change has not been ascertained to date. In this study binary Ti48at.%Al alloys of equiaxed, duplex and fully lamellar microstructure have been deformed in tension to various degrees of strain up to fracture, at both room and elevated temperature. The active fracture modes have been identified by SEM fractography. Moreover, the deformation modes active in these two phase TiAl compounds during tensile loading have been determined by TEM. Thin foils for the TEM characterization have been obtained from cuts perpendicular and parallel to the load axis at various locations in the gage sections as close as 10 &#181;m from the actual fracture surface. The results of these investigations are discussed specifically with respect to the origin of the reported fracture mode changes, and the mechanisms fundamentally underlying the plasticity and fracture of these (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2) TiAl compounds.

Creep constrained grain boundary cavitation in fully lamellar form of titanium aluminide intermetallic alloy has been studied using finite element techniques. Two different forms of fully lamellar models are considered. Cavitation is modeled in the presence of grain boundary sliding for the case of straight former grain boundaries and cavitation without grain boundary sliding is considered for fully lamellar microstructure with serrated former grain boundaries. Effect of interaction of cavitating facets on rupture life has been studied. A comparison between the fully lamellar forms and a dual phase equiaxed microstructure having the same phase ratio (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">) is also made to examine the relative susceptibility of these microstructures to high temperature damage.

<P>
Laboratory and pilot-scale tests are almost invariably required before metallurgical development can proceed. Difficulties with sampling, as well as with classical chemical and physical scale-ups are normally anticipated and relatively well-understood, but more subjective factors also come into play, including misunderstandings of the operating scheme chosen, wrong &quot;lessons&quot; learned from similar operations, failures to handle data appropriately, and even arbitrary intervention by management. The paper examines some of these subjective factors and suggests ways to guard against them. Several anecdotal case studies are used as examples, including when and where to heap leach or to mill specific types of gold ore.

PREDICTING PRODUCTION HEAP LEACH CYCLE TIMES FROM LABORATORY COLUMN TEST DATA:</B> <I>Philip Thompson,</I> President, Dawson Metallurgical Laboratories, Inc., Murray UT 84157-0685
<P>
Carefully planned Laboratory test programs provide valuable data regarding the amenability of low grade gold ores to heap leaching. Several problems are encountered in laboratory column simulation of gold heap leaching. A problem most commonly associated with column testwork is the limit on test column height. Most laboratories use a 3 to 5 meters (or 9 to 15 feet) high column as a standard test due to building ceilings and sample size limitations, etc. The problem with this column height is that most commercial heaps are at least 10 to 15 meters (25-35 feet) high, with some heaps reaching 100-200 meters (225-450 feet). This paper presents a data interpretation method whereby the data from test columns of virtually any height can be used to predict a first approximation leach cycle time for commercial heaps. Other important factors, e.i. sample preparation protocol, preliminary bottle roll testing, column diameter requirements, and leach solution analysis, are also discussed.

<P>
Viceroy Resource Corporation of Vancouver, B.C., has recently developed and brought into production the Brewery Creek Mine, an open-pit heap leach gold mine, located 55km east of Dawson City in Yukon, Canada. Mineable reserves are 15.2 million tonnes of ore grading 1.45 grams/tonne, containing 22 tonnes (707, 315 oz) of gold. Ore processing employs the heap leach technology using run-of-mine ore. Highlights of 1996 activity included construction of a 158,000m2 of leach pad, placing 1.9 million tonnes of ore at a grade of 1.46 gpt to the leach pad, construction and successful commissioning of the ADR plant, and pouring of the first gold bar on November 15th. Permitting of this mine has drawn significant attention because of the innovated heap leach technology; although this technology has been proven in other jurisdictions, it has not been used at such northern sites where winter temperatures routinely reach -45(C for extended periods. Acknowledgments are extended to the staff of the Viceroy Resources Corporation for their participation in developing the successful heap leaching technology under extreme frigid climatic conditions.

The development of powder-in-tube Bi2Sr2Can-1)CunOx technology has progressed such that high critical current density (Jc) conductors are produced by many researchers. An important issue that remains, however, is the effects of mechanical strain. While it is evident that large strains induce irreversible damage, applications may be limited by fatigue at low strain values due to crack propagation. Here we report upon the effects of cyclic fatigue on Jc of Ag and Ag-alloy clad Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox as measured by electrical transport and magnetic hysteresis. Measurements of the constituent and composite mechanical properties and bulk Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox fracture toughness are also reported. As Jc may be limited by microcracks before straining, studies of crack propagation and mechanical strain effects may also provide insight into the fundamental limits to transport Jc. Results are interpreted within this framework as well.

A vibrating sample magnetometer has been used to measure M-H loops (losses). Losses were measured, and it was possible to separate out; (i) critical state losses, (ii) eddy current losses, (iii) logarithmic type creep influences on the losses, and (iv) exponential type creep influences on the losses.

An important characteristic of high temperature superconducting materials is the ability to carry large Jc at high magnetic field. As a result, the NHMFL anticipates using HTS conductor for the highest field region of the 1 GHz NMR magnet system. Two obstacles to high field Jc over long lengths are poor flux pinning and carbon-induced bubbling and tunneling. Here we report progress on these two challenges via fine-scale additives to the starting powder. To address the flux pinning issue, we are investigating nano-scale MgO additions. By growing the 2212 grains around the MgO particles, pinning centers are directly incorporated in the superconducting grains. To prevent bubbling and tunneling from CO2 gas that forms during melt processing we are investigating Ba-O additions. By trapping the carbon in BaCO3, CO2 formation is prevented. We report magnetic and electrical measurements of Jc, extensive microscopy, and x-ray diffraction of tapes formed with these approaches.

JOINING ALUMINUM MATERIALS USING ULTRASONIC IMPACTORS:</B> <I>Glenn Freitas</I>, Aztex, Inc., 303 Bear Hill Road, Waltham, MA 02154-1196
<P>
The joining approach being presented here uses ultrasonic impactors to insert steel pins directly to join aluminum to aluminum or aluminum to composite materials. The concept does not require any machining or preparation of the aluminum components to be joined. Using this process, inexpensive mill products, sheet, extrusions, etc. can be used directly without additional machining to create complex structures. More importantly, this process will produce very high performance structures similar to the weight efficiency of co-cured carbon composites at a fraction of the cost.

THERMAL SPRAYING OF ALUMINUM AS AN ADHESIVE BOND PRETREATMENT:</B> <I>Guy Davis</I>, DACCO SCI, Inc., 10260 Old Columbia Road, Columbia, MD 21046

DACCO SCI, Inc., (DSI) evaluates two-wire arc thermal spray coatings as an adherent pretreatment. This work will build on previous experience of DSI with plasma spray coatings as treatments for aluminum adherents. These treatments exhibit performance equivalent to the best chemical treatments but are environmentally benign. Thermal spray processes generate no gaseous or liquid wastes and minimal solid wastes. Additionally, they are robust processes that are capable of being preformed on localized areas in the field or depot during repair/refurbishment operations. Alternatively, parts may be sprayed in advance and stored indefinitely prior to use. The two-wire arc process is considerably cheaper and less complicated then the plasma spray process.

UTILIZATION OF RECYCLED AND UNRECOVERABLE ALUMINUM SCRAPS IN MANUFACTURING CELLULAR CONCRETE:</B> <I>Jiann-Yang (Jim) Hwang</I>, Michigan Technological University, 1400 Townsend Drive, Houghton, MI 49931-1295
<P>
In manufacturing cellular concrete, finely divided metallic aluminum powder is used to react with hydroxides, forming minute bubbles of hydrogen gas throughout the concrete mixture. Traditionally, high cost pure aluminum powder is used in manufacturing cellular concrete which greatly increases the cost of the products. To use traditionally unrecoverable aluminum wastes, a pretreatment process will be employed to separate magnetic metal and dirt from the stream and to grind the main stream waste into aluminum powder. The effect of moisture content in the waste on grinding quality will be examined and evaluated. The effects of the amount of recycled aluminum and the alkalies concentration in the mixture will be studied. Finally, the mechanical and physical properties of the cellular concrete will be examined and evaluated.

<P>
Solid-state spray forming (SSF) is a promising new technology for saving energy in the production of aluminum near-net shapes. Because SSF does not require melting of the feedstock, ITI anticipates producing aluminum parts at significantly lower energy input than conventional alternatives require. The light weight, high strength, and recyclable features of these parts will propagate this energy savings through the life of the parts. SSF is potentially applicable to the production of aluminum metal matrix composites, also in near-net shapes; and provides the compelling possibility of producing MMCs with non-traditional strengthening phases, including nonophase particles.

<P>
For the safe high-temperature use of rhenium we have the task of measuring the stress/rupture strength at extremely high temperatures. For stress/rupture tests on high melting metals we designed and built a test system that allows measurements to be made at temperatures up to 3,000&#176;C under an inert atmosphere. Using this test unit we determined stress/rupture diagrams of rhenium in several material conditions in the range of 2,100&#176;C to 3,000&#176;C. The discussion of the measured values is based on me/allographic test results, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of rhenium samples after the stress/rupture tests, the determination of trace impurities using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and the results of the residual gas analysis of rhenium.

INFLUENCE OF COLD ROLLING ON PLASTIC RESPONSE OF PM AND CVD RHENIUM</B>: G. Subhash, B.J. Koeppel, Mechanical Engineering-Engineering Mechanics Department, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI 49931
<P>
Plastic response of rhenium (Re) produced by powder metallurgy (PM) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was investigated under uniaxial compression. The PM Re was also cold rolled by 50% and 80% reduction (denoted as PM50 and PM80, respectively) in thickness. Both cold rolled and CVD Re have been found to have a strong basal texture. Cylindrical specimens from the above four types of Re (i.e., PM, PM50, PM80 and CVD) were subjected to uniaxial compressive loads in the range of strain rates from 1x10-3 s-1 to 9.5 x 103 s-l. Low strain rate experiments were performed in an Instron machine and high strain rate experiments were performed in a split Hopkinson pressure bar. The deformed specimens were metallographically prepared and etched to study microstructural changes and identify the micromechanisms of deformation. Rhenium exhibited a two stage hardening in its plastic response. It revealed a high strain hardening rate and a strong strain rate sensitivity of flow stress. Increased cold work in the PM Re resulted in an increase in the initial yield stress with a concurrent reduction in the hardening rate and failure strain. CVD Re exhibited a distinctly higher hardening rate and ultimate flow stress than the above cold rolled PM Re. After accumulating a certain amount of plastic strain, the deformation in the specimens localized leading to formation of shear bands at an angle to the loading axis. Fracture immediately followed the shear bands. Twinning was found to be a dominant deformation mode in both PM and CVD Re. Extensive twinning was observed in larger grains of CVD Re. Twins in fine &quot;rained PM specimens were less common and occurred primarily in the regions close to the shearband. Based on the experimental results and microscopic investigations, the micromechanisms of deformation responsible for the observed behavior of Re will be discussed.

Second phase particle-strengthened tungsten alloy, tungsten-4w/o rhenium-0.32w/o hafnium carbide (W-4Re-0.32HfC), was creep-tested at temperature ranges of 2200 to 2400K and stress ranges of 40 to 70 Mpa in a vacuum of better than 1.3 x 10-6 Pa (1 x 10-8 torr). The resulting steady state creep rates were applied to three particle-strengthened creep models and compared. The three creep models were Ansell-Weertman, Lagneborg, and Roesler-Arzt. None of the three models precisely predicted the steady state creep rates of W-4Re-0.32HfC. However, the recovery creep model of Lagneborg qualitatively fit the creep rates.

The microhardness of rolled rhenium sheets was determined as a function of indentation load and temperature. Sheets of rhenium were produced from rhenium metal powder by pressing, presintering and sintering, followed by cold rolling. After a production anneal to define the structure of the starting material, sheet samples were deformed using cold rolling to about 30% strain in 5% deformation increments without intermediate annealings. One of the deformed samples was annealed at 1600&#176;C for 20 minutes. The temperature dependence of the microhardness between room temperatures and 900&#176;C (using 50&#176; increments) was studied using a Nikon Model QM hot hardness tester equipped with a Vickers indentor. The load dependence of the microhardness was investigated using both a Vickers anda Knopp indentor, and the indentation size effect (ISE) was best explained using the normalized Meyer's law. The hardness of the annealed rhenium sheet approached that of the as-rolled sheets at large indentation loads because of workhardening under the indentor during indentation. The hardness at &quot;zero load&quot; (obtained from extrapolation of the load dependence of the hardness) suggests that the hardness is controlled by two different mechanism having different thermal activation. The activation energy of the mechanism controlling the hardness at low temperatures is approximately 0.02 eV whereas that at high temperatures is approximately 0.5 eV. The transition temperature between the two controlling mechanisms occurs at about 250C.

<P>
Twinning is a dominant deformation mode in both PM and CVD rhenium. Although severe work hardening occurs during cold rolling, extensive twinning enables rhenium to retain moderate ductility. It is believed that as the deformation process progresses, twinning becomes the predominate mode contributing to the plastic deformation of rhenium. At all deformations, the hardness and strength of rhenium decreases at annealing temperatures corresponding to the temperature of the onset of recrystallization. It is known that the recrystallization temperature of rhenium decreases with increasing amounts of cold work, from 1750&#176;C for 5% deformation to 1200&#176;C for 40-60% deformation. This strong dependence exist because the nucleation of recrystallization occurs at the intersection of twin crystals and growth proceeds on the bases of the twins. When a polycrystalline material is deformed, the individual grains tend to orient themselves so that the active slip systems become more favorably oriented with respect to the direction of the principal strain. This leads to crystallographic anisotropy or preferred orientation. In a recent study, the effect of rolling mode on PM rhenium was evaluated. Samples rolled at a 45&#176; direction showed a higher work hardening rate than samples rolled along the width and length of rolled sintered bars. This paper will review the interactions of cold work and annealing on the work hardening, recrystallization, and texture of rhenium.

It has been known for many years that the brittleness commonly seen in commercial-pure molybdenum around room temperature can be greatly reduced or eliminated by alloying with rhenium within the solubility range fro rhenium in molybdenum. Molybdenum-based solid solution alloys with rhenium represent a technically important class of refractory metal alloys whose behavior is reviewed in this paper. Mechanical and physical properties are reviewed as well as the fabrication characteristics of the alloys. Data from the vast amount of research performed on molybdenum-rhenium alloys in the former Soviet Union and more recently in Russia are referenced, summarized and reviewed.

The tungsten sheets made by using the powder metallurgy method displayed low plasticity and were apt to delamination in the rolling plane. In order to improve plasticity of the sheets and suppress delamination the additions of the W-Re and HfO powders were employed. On the basis of such compositions the tungsten sheets were obtained which were plastically deformed at 223K. That sheets manifested the fracture toughness in the rolling plane by factor of five higher as compared with the initial sheets.

Ti-6Al-2Sn-2Zr-2Mo-2Cr (Ti-6-2-2-2-2) is an alpha-beta titanium alloy typically utilized in thick section, damage tolerance-driven aerospace applications. This alloy was developed for deep hardenability, with high strength, and moderate fracture toughness. Ti-62222, research efforts to date have been primarily focused on rolled plate and forged products; however, there is interest in developing thin sheet material for wing skin applications. A rolling practice to produce Ti-6-2-2-2-2 sheet materials for conventional and superplastically formed structure has been developed. The work described here characterizes the properties, microstructure, and fracture behavior or Ti-6&#173;2-2-2-2 solution treated and aged sheet samples subjected to tensile and cyclic loadings. Tensile and fatigue crack growth tests were performed over a wide temperature range (-65&#176;F to 500&#176;F) to assess the suitability of the sheet in various applications. Crack growth testing was performed utilizing two Rratios at each temperature of interest. Test data indicates that the crack growth behavior of Ti-6-2222 is superior to Ti-6Al-4V sheet in the Paris regime under comparable test conditions. A complete metallurgical analysis utilizing both scanning electron and transmission microscopy was conducted to develop property/microstructure relationships, and selected test specimens were examined to provide insight regarding fracture mechanisms with respect to typical cyclic loading conditions.

Superplastic deformation test was also carried out to confirm the results of load relaxation test. The experimental results were analyzed by the theory of inelastic deformation which consists of two mechanisms, i.e., one is the grain matrix deformation and the other is the phase/grain boundary sliding. Grain matrix deformation is dominant at 600&#176;C and well described by the state equation when permeability parameter, p, is 0.15. Phase boundary sliding is dominant at 800&#176;C and also consistent with the viscous flow equation with Mg=2.

A two phase <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> titanium alloy, Ti6Al2Mo2Cr2Sn2Zr0.2Si (Ti-6-22-22S), has recently been reconsidered as a structural material for aircraft applications. This alloy exhibits specific strength and fracture toughness superior to that of Ti6A14V. However, similar to other alpha-beta titanium alloys, microstructural stability is one of the major concerns regarding industrial application of Ti62222S. For instance, precipitation of additional phases during long term high temperature exposure is predicted to affect significantly the performance of components in service. Three different precipitates have been observed in Ti-6-2222S alloys, namely silicides, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/omega.gif"> and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2 phases. The presence of intermetallic precipitates, such as <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2, in the parent a matrix has been reported to result in brittle behaviour of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> alloys due to the formation of intense planar slip on {101U} prismatic planes.

Fatigue crack nucleation, microcrack growth and long crack growth are often oppositely affected by microstructural changes. For example, refining the microstructural unit size, e.g., grain size, improves the material's resistance to crack nucleation and microcrack growth, while long crack characteristics often deteriorate.

Creep properties of the lamellar structured Ti46.6AI1.4Mn2Mo (at.&#176;/O) alloy, which is made by hot extrusion of a blended elemental powder mixture, are investigated in air environment over the temperature range from 750&#176;C to 900&#176;C at constant stress levels ranging from 100MPa to 250MPa. Average grain size of 150&#181;m is measured and the grain boundary phase is distributed inhomogeneously before the creep tests. The dislocation climb controlled creep deformation is suggested on the basis of the measured average activation energy for creep of 388kJ/mol and normalized stress exponent of 4.3 within the temperature range from 775&#176;C to 900&#176;C at stress level ranging from 150MPa to 250MPa. However, activation energy of 90kJ/mol within the temperature range of 750&#176;C to 775&#176;C and stress exponent of I.3 at 800&#176;C within the stress range of 100150MPa are measured. Microstructural studies conducted on the creep fractured specimens showed the secondary cracks along the lamellar grain boundaries and these secondary cracks are assumed to be formed by pore nucleation, growth and coalescence during the tertiary stage.

The microstructural changes during high temperature deformation behavior of Ti-(46,48)Al2W and Ti47Al2Cr4Nb intermetallic compounds have been investigated by isothermal compression tests at temperatures ranged from 1000&#176;C to 1200&#176;C with strain rates ranged 10-3/10-1/s-1. The stressstrain curve exhibited a peak stress then the flow stress decreased gradually into a steady state with increasing strain. The stressstrain curves showed a flow softening which is attributed to the dynamic recrystallization. The dependences of flow stress on temperature and strain rate were formulated using Zener-Hollomon parameter. The activation energies were measured as 437kJ/mol, 374kJ/mol and 300kJ/mol and the stress exponents were measured as 5.8, 5.3 and 4.9 for Ti46AI2W, Ti48AI2W and Ti47AI2Cr4Nb, respectively. The dynamically recrystallized microstructures were investigated and the relationships between recrystallized grain size and temperature compensated strain rate was discussed. The texture evolution during high temperature deformation was analyzed using the orientation distribution function (ODF). The controlling mechanisms during high temperature deformation of TiAl intermetallic compounds with varying temperature, strain and strain rate were discussed.

In this paper, the fatigue behavior of long cracks in Titanium Aluminides (lamellar and fully <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">) is compared, based on microstructure, temperature and environment criteria, with five conventional Titanium alloys in different thermomechanical conditions. At room temperature, higher threshold (related to enhanced near-threshold contribution of crack closure) and lower KIC contributes to much more steep propagation curves on TiAl. At high temperature in air, the crack growth regime identifies on Ti alloys as a corrosion-fatigue mechanism assisted by water vapor is shown to be also oporative for TiAl alloys. In all the cases, the propagation of fatigue cracks in both types of materials seems to be governed by the same mechanisms and the TiAl alloys appears to be more sensitive to moisture than Ti based alloys.

ENVIRONMENTALLY ASSISTED FATIGUE CRACK PROPAGATION IN Ti 6246 at 500&#176;C:</B> J. Petit, C. Sarrazin-Baudoux, S. Lesterlin, Y. Chabanne, Laboratoire de Mechanique et de Physique des Materlaux, UFA CNRS 863, ENSMA, BP 109, 86960 Fuuturoscope, France
<P>
The fatigue and crack propagation behavior of Ti 6246 alloys elaborated with a fine Windmanstatten microstructure, has been investigated at 500&#176;C. Tests were performed in air, high vacuum (10-4 Pa), low vacuum (1Pa) and humidified Argon (100 Pa and atmospheric pressure). Partial pressures of water vapour and oxygen were controlled by mean of hygro-metals and mass spectrometer. Crack closure was detected using a capacitive gauge mounted at the mouth of the notch of CT specimens. The enhancement of the crack growth rates in the mean-threshold area and the mid-rate range observed in the different environments in comparison to high vacuum, is clearly related to the presence of water vapor even at very low partial pressure. Critical conditions (partial pressure, frequency, closure, load ratio) for the occurrence of water vapor assisted corrosion-fatigue, creep-fatigue and stress-corrosion are explored, and the specific role of oxygen and water vapor is discussed on the basis of microfractographic observations, fracture surface analysis (R.B.S. technique) and closure measurements.

PRE-CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND PRELIMINARY NEUTRONIC ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED NATIONAL SPALLATION NEUTRON SOURCE:</B> <I>J.O. Johnson</I>, J.M. Barnes, L.A. Charlton, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6363
<P>
The Department of Energy has initiated a pre-conceptual design study for the National Spallation Neutron Source (NSNS) and given preliminary approval for the proposed facility to be built at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The pre-conceptual design of the NSNS consists of an accelerator system capable of delivering a 1-2 GeV proton beam, with 1 MW of beam power, in an approximate 0.5 microsecond pulse, at a 60 Hz frequency onto a single target station. The NSNS will be upgraded in stages to a 5 MW facility with two target stations (a 60 Hz station and a 10 Hz station). There are many possible layouts and designs for the NSNS target stations. This paper gives a brief overview of the proposed NSNS with respect to the target station, as well as the general philosophy adopted for the neutronic design of the NSNS target stations. A reference design, based upon experience at existing sources and on designs for proposed new, high power, sources is presented, and some of the preliminary design neutronic results for the NSNS are briefly discussed.

CALCULATED NEUTRONIC PERFORMANCE AND RADIATION DAMAGE PARAMETERS FOR THE UPGRADED MANUEL LUHAN, JR., NEUTRON SCATTERING CENTER TARGET SYSTEM:</B> <I>P.D. Ferguson</I>, G.J. Russell, E.J. Pitcher, J.D. Court, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
The upgraded MLNSC target system is designed to be a split target with two tiers of moderators. The original suite of moderators serving 12 flight paths has been optimized and an additional pair of moderators, one water and one LH2, have been added in a new upper moderator tier serving 4 additional flight paths. The upper moderators are coupled and viewed in backscattering geometry, as opposed to the decoupled moderators in the existing MLNSC target system which are viewed in transmission. Fabrication of this new target system is currently in progress and installation is expected in 1998. The neutronic performance of the target system s presented in the form of time and energy spectra for each of the planned moderators with comparisons to the existing MLNSC moderators. Results of several studies, including moderator thickness, upper target length, and reflector material, are presented. For the upper and lower targets, target canister material, and moderator structural material, we present neutron and proton energy spectra, helium production, and DPA calculations. Existing accelerator materials damage data are referenced, where applicable, to draw general conclusions on component lifetime.

CALCULATED NEUTRONIC PERFORMANCE OF A LONG-PULSE SPALLATION SOURCE:</B> <I>G.J. Russell</I>, E.J. Pitcher, P.D. Ferguson, J.D. Court, D.J. Weinacht, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
Neutronic performance studies of a Long-Pulse Spallation Source (LPSS) at the Los Alamos National Laboratory show that a 1-MS LPSS has world-class neutronic performance with low technical risk. An LPSS uses coupled moderators (moderators that communicate neutronically at all energies with an adjacent reflector). There are potential gains of about a factor of 6 in time-averaged neutron brightness for a coupled moderator compared to a decoupled one; however, this gain comes at the expense of putting &quot;tails&quot; on the neutron pulses. The particulars of a neutron pulse from a moderator (e.g., rise time, peak intensity, pulse width as measured by the standard deviation or full-width at half maximum of the pulse, and decay constant(s) of the tails) are crucial parameters for instrument design/performance at an LPSS. Moderator neutronic performance can be altered in a variety of ways: a)target material and geometry; (b) moderator material and geometry; c) target-moderator geometry; d) reflector material; e) presence of decouplers and flight path liners; and f) the proton pulse width. We will discuss the neutronic performance of an LPSS and describe the variety of neutronic optimization studies that have been done to improve the neutronic performance of such a neutron source.

The APT project is in the process of qualifying materials for use in the target/blanket assembly. As part of the process, an eight month irradiation of prospective target, blanket, beam entry window, and structural materials is taking place at LASREF in the 800-MeV, 1 mA proton beam. The irradiation is configured to produce samples at prototypic APT radiation environments, as well as samples at reduced damage rates to provide information as to how the materials age in an APT environment. In addition, three prototype lead blanket modules are being irradiated along with several aluminum tubes filled with 3He to experimentally determine the extent of tritium implantation in the APT system and to explore possible mitigation techniques. In this paper, we detail the methodology of the neutronic design of the irradiation. Neutron and proton spectra are presented for several irradiation locations and materials, as well as calculated gas production and dpa estimates.

Progress will be reported on the status of an irradiation by 800 MeV protons and spallation neutrons to determine the change in mechanical properties of materials to be used in the APT project. Materials will be irradiated for 8-9 months at the Los Alamos Radiation Effects Facility (LASREF). The irradiation matrix, developed by members of several laboratories nationwide, consists of specimens of candidate materials, scaled components and a closed-loop water system to measure rates of corrosion in irradiated water. The objectives are to determine the performance (particularly, mechanical and corrosion properties) of materials in APT-prototypic proton and neutron radiation and temperatures, to test manufacturing processes for producing components, and to develop a surveillance program to monitor the properties of materials during the life of the APT target/blanket.

THERMAL PLASMA ENHANCED CHEMICAL VAPOR INFILTRATION:</B> Patrick R. Taylor, Banqiu Wu, Edgar E. Vidal, University of Idaho, Department of Metallurgical &amp; Mining Engineering, Moscow, ID 83844-3024
<P>
A novel method for chemical vapor infiltration, using thermal plasma technology, has been developed. The use of a thermal plasma source may allow much greater infiltration rates than conventional CVI. Precursors that are fed into the flame region of the plasma are vaporized and forced to flow through a porous preform, at a controlled temperature, where condensation or chemical reactions occur. Exploratory experiments, using silica and methane as precursors and graphite felt for the preform, have been performed. The change in the pressure drop across the preform, as infiltration occurred, is compensated by the use of a vacuum pump on the discharge of the reactor. The product was characterized using SEM and x-ray diffraction. A uniform infiltration rate of SiC was observed along the width of the preform.

<P>
One of the criteria to define the market value of chromite concentrate is its chromium to iron ratio. Changing this ratio for a definite chromite is impossible by physical processing. This study investigates the possibility of increasing this ratio through the carbochlorination of chromite concentrate by Cl2+CO between 500 to 900C. The evolution of the reaction products' characteristics is determined by SEM, XRD and chemical analysis. The carbochlorination of a chromite concentrate at 600C leads to the selective partial elimination of iron allowing a higher Cr/Fe ratio of the treated concentrate. A flow-sheet for the benefication of chromite is suggested.

The oxidation characteristics of solid copper matte particles under simulated Kennecott-Outokumpu Flash Converting conditions are presented. This project is concerned with the determination of the effects of operating variables on the reaction of the particles. Experiments were carried out in a large laboratory-scale flash furnace with 72 wt% Cu matte by varying initial particle size, temperature, oxygen partial pressure, oxygen to matte mass-ratio and residence time. Chemical analysis and optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to study the oxidation, morphology and mineralogy. Fractional conversion and sulfur removal, in general, slightly decreased with initial particle size while higher oxygen to matte mass-ratio mainly resulted in higher fractional conversion and more efficient sulfur removal. The fractional conversion values represented the overall extent of oxidation more closely than degree of sulfur removal.

Four different nickel concentrates were oxidized in a laboratory scale Laminar flow furnace in simulated flash smelting conditions. The major nickel- and iron-bearing minerals in the concentrates were pentlandite, violarite, gersdorffite, and pyrite and pyrrhotite, respectively. Thermal decomposition, ignition and oxidation behavior of nickel and iron sulfides were examined by using optical and scanning electron microscopy. General reactivity of the concentrates was monitored with sulfur removal which was most effective in violarite-based concentrate. Penlandite-concentrates needed higher experimental temperatures for complete desulfurisation and gersdorffite-based concentrate contained 5 <I>- </I>10 % of the original sulfur even at the most oxidizing conditions studied (11000C, 50 vol-% O2). The reactivity of the iron minerals were found to depend on the other minerals present in the concentrate.

The modified quasichemical model has been applied to Co-Cu-Fe-Ni-S mattes. A small set of model parameters was obtained from optimization of experimental data for the binary Co-S, Cu-S, Fe-S and Ni-S systems. The thermodynamic properties of the ternary, quaternary and quinary systems are then predicted a priori by the model with no additional adjustable parameters. Agreement with all available data for ternary and quaternary mattes is within experimental error limits. The parameters are stored as a database of the F*A*C*T thermodynamic computer system and can be used along with other F*A*C*T databases for alloy, slag, speiss and gas phases, and with Gibbs energy minimization software, to simulate equilibria during smelting processes.

Constituent particles in 2024-T3 and 7075-T6 aluminum alloys were identified by analytical electron microscopy (AEM) to aid the understanding of particle-induced pitting corrosion. Convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) was used, in conjunction with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), for determining their structure and composition. Typical phases in these alloys (CuA12, CuMgAl2 and Fe4CuA123) were identified. In addition, a complex rhombohedral phase, with composition close to (Fe, Cu, Mn, Si)Al, was also identified. Detailed aspects of these particles are described, and their role in pitting corrosion are discussed. *Research supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Grant F49620-93-1-0426, and the Federal Aviation Administration, Grant 92-G-0006.

To better understand particle-induced pitting corrosion in aluminum alloys, thin- foil specimens of 2024-T3 and 7075-T6 aluminum alloys, with identified constituent particles, were immersed in aerated 0.5 M NaCl solution and then examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results clearly showed matrix dissolution around the iron and manganese containing particles (such as, Fe4CuAl23). Matrix dissolution was also observed around CuAl2 particles, while CuMgAl2 particles tended to dissolve relative to the matrix. These results are consistent with previous SEM observations of pitting corrosion, and are discussed in terms of the electrochemical characteristics of the particles and the matrix.

The sensitivity of the scratch technique towards understanding the corrosion behavior of 6061 aluminum alloy reinforced with 0.1 volume fraction of alumina particles and in the monolithic form has been explored. Identical solutionizing treatment in the two materials shows different transient current responses. The depassivation and repassivation kinetics appear to differ considerably during the impact and continuous scratches since a balance between the two results in stabilized value of peak current during continuous scratching experiments only. The total charge density increases linearly with solutionizing time for both materials while grain growth law (square of the grain diameter is directly proportional to the solutionizing time) is valid for up to 25 hours of solutionizing time. Near surface microstructures have been examined with the help of TEM as well as SEM. This research has been supported by the National Science Foundation through the grant number HRD9353547.

In order to prevent and/or mitigate intergranular stress corrosion cracking(IGSCC) occurring in sensitized Alloy 600, the surface of the material was alloyed with Cr or Cr-Ni powder using a CO2 laser beam. The thickness of the alloyed region was measured to be around 200 250 &#181;m. The Microstructure and the compositional variations of the alloyed layers were analysed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and analyzed using EDX attached to the TEM. The alloyed molten metal was observed to solidify epitaxially from the boundary between the melted and unmeted(matrix) regions, like the microstructure of sensitized Alloy 600 surface-melted by a CO2 beam. The compositional change in the alloyed layer was very small, i.e. very homogeneus. The surface-alloyed specimens were tested in a sodium tetrathionate (Na2S406) solution at room temperature using a CERT technique. IGSCC was completely prevented by the surface-alloying using a CO2 laser beam, i.e. the specimen was ruptured and the fracture surface was observed to consist of dimples, which is a typical morphology of specimen fractured by ductile failure(rupture). The relationship between the microstructure and the susceptibility to IGSCC will be discussed.

The effect of load ratio on the corrosion-fatigue crack growth kinetics and the stress-corrosion cracking of the precipitation-hardenable stainless steels PH13-8Mo, 15-SPH, and 17-4PH in a 3.5% NaC1 solution were investigated. All three PH-class stainless steels exhibit good stress-corrosion cracking resistance with stress-corrosion cracking thresholds in excess of 70 MPa<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/squareroot-m.gif">. These steels also demonstrate good corrosion-fatigue cracking resistance in a 3.5% NaC1 solution as the crack growth rates in a 3.5% NaC1 solution are less than twice the rates in ambient air. The corrosion-fatigue cracking thresholds progressively decrease as the load ratio (R) increases from 0.10 to 0.90. PH138Mo exhibits anomalous corrosion-fatigue crack growth kinetics and a concomitant change in fracture mode at R=0.90. The observed crack growth behavior, the deformation microstructure, and the significance of high load ratio corrosion fatigue will be discussed.

<P>
Alloy 690 exhibits excellent resistance to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and is frequently used in steam generator applications. In order to achieve the desired microstructure for SCC resistance in A690, high temperature solution annealing heat treatments are required. These heat treatments, though, can result in extensive grain growth and relatively low strength. Powder metallurgy processing and the addition of nitrogen during atomization results in an alloy with significantly improved microstructural control and properties. This study examines the microstructure and properties of a nitrogen gas atomized A690 heat consolidated by HIP and extrusion. The effects of consolidation temperature and subsequent hot working is also discussed.

<P>
Intermetallic compound NiAl has the potential to be used as a turbine blade material for aerospace applications due to its low density, high thermal conductivity, and good oxidation resistance. However, it suffers from insufficient toughness at low temperatures. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of displacement rate on the brittle-to-ductile transition (BDT) in NiAl single crystals. Double-notched-tensile specimens with [110] tensile axis were used for fracture toughness testing. The results of this study show a strong strain rate dependence of BDT temperature, however, the low temperature toughness level was insensitive to the applied displacement rate. Fracture paths of the specimens fractured at different temperatures and strain rates were analyzed and the crack initiation and propagation mechanisms were investigated. In this paper, the process of BDT in NiAl single crystal will be discussed in terms of thermally activated deformation processes and their effects on crack initiation and propagation.

The effect of y'-Ni,(Ti, Al) and a phase precipitation on the mechanical properties and the corrosion resistance to sea water was investigated in Fe-(2025)%Cr-35%Ni-(4.5-6)%Mo-2%Ti-0.3%Alalloys. Though the hardness of the alloy increases after <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">' and a phase precipitation, pitting-corrosion resistance is deteriorated by a phase, while deterioration by <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">' phase precipitation is little. The precipitation of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">' is found to occur almost simultaneously with a phase in 25%Cr-4. 5%Mo alloy. However, in 20%Cr-6%Mo alloy, the aging condition for <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">' phase to precede <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/sigma.gif"> phase is found, which achieves both Vickers hardness of 320, and critical pitting temperature(CPT) of 323K.

Three dimensional (3-D) microstructures of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/epsilon.gif">=1.34 (280 % deformed) silicon nitride nitride specimen were calculated using the stereological analysis. The grain radius slightly increased during deformation. The aspect ratio remained almost constant up to <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/epsilon.gif">= 0.88, and then, largely increased. The orientation angle decreased monotonously. A dominant deformation modes are considered to be grain sliding (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/epsilon.gif">= 0.88-1.34). Grain rotation and alignment also act as sub-dominant deformation mode all through the deformation.

A TEM STUDY ON THE MICROSTRUCTURALEFFECTS ON PLASTIC DEFORMATION IN ALUMINUM ALLOY2219:</B> Carlos D. Rincon, Roy Arrowood , Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering and Materials Research Institute, The University of Texas at E1 Paso, E1 Paso, TX 79968-0520
<P>
A fundamental transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation is being conducted on the effects of microstructure on the plastic deformation of 2219-T87 aluminum. A previous study showed inhomogeneous and locally extreme work hardening in the heataffected-zone (HAZ)- regions in Variable Polarity Plasma Arc (VPPA) 2219-T87 butt welds, which strongly suggests that the HAZ microstructure plays a major role in the deformation and fracture process. Due to the small size of these butt welds, it can be quite difficult to accurately quantify the stress-strain behavior of the HAZ. Therefore, precipitate structures similar to ones found in the HAZ are being produced by heat treatment of tensile specimens machined from 2219-T87 plate. Heat treatments involve varying the aging time and temperature to obtain GP zones followed by the precipitation of transition phases. Uniaxial tensiIe tests will be performed on the heat treated specimens at low strain rates (0.01 mine-1 and 5.0 min-1') at room temperature in order to quantify the effect of precipitate structure on the stress-strain behavior. This work was supported by the General Electric Faculty of the Future Program.

COMPREHENSIVE FLOW STRESS DETERMINATION IN EXTRUDED ALUMINUM PRODUCTS:</B> <I>Michael S. Paulson</I>, Roger N. Wright, Materials Science and Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy NY 12180
<P>
Physical modeling of the aluminum extrusion process e reductions is difficult due to the large reductions and the complex extrudate shapes. Conventional machines flow stress specimens are not likely to be representative of the metal as it is extruded. A method of directly testing the total cross section is needed to properly represent extrudate flow stresses for process modeling purposes. Such a method is presented, as applied to rapidly heated commercial aluminum extrudates at temperatures and strain rates pertinent to die exit conditions. Resulting constitutive equations are compared to those developed for starting billet stock from the same lot of metal.

EFFECT OF REDISTRIBUTING RESIDUAL STRESS ON THE FATIGUE BEHAVIOR OF SS330 WELDMENT:</B> Yong-Bok Lee, Chin-Sung Chung, Dept. of Mechanical Eng., Hong-Ik University of Seoul; Nam-Ik Cho, Dept. of Mech.

<P>
Effect of residual stress and its redistribution in weldment on the fatigue crack propagation was investigated. Fatigue tests were conducted using center notched specimens machines from welded plats. The residual stress and its redistribution were measured by a magnetizing stress indicator and hole drilling method. The residual stresses were found to be redistributed during crack propagation. Crack growth rates were predicted and compared with the experimental results. It has been found that the predicted crack growth rates have a better agreement with the experimental results when the redistributing residual stress, rather than residual stress, was considered. Also when the concept of partial crack closure was adopted in the analysis of crack growth rates, fatigue crack growth rates were a good agreement with, in spite of variation of stress ratio.

Creep testing performed on 40 and 62 wt.% beryllium compositions of a powder metallurgy composite alloy at several elevated temperatures indicated a dependence of steady state creep rates and times to rupture on beryllium content, test direction, stress, and test temperature. A stress exponent of 8.5 for 40% beryllium and 10 for 62% beryllium was obtained from tests at 550 degrees F. A lower stress exponent of 6.7 was found for 62% beryllium at 630 degrees F. Activation energies for creep were somewhat higher than for self-diffusion in either pure metal, and exhibited significant anisotropy.

NEUTRON DIFFRACTION STUDY OF THE CO-DEFORMATION BEHAVIOR OF BERYLLIUM-ALUMINUM:</B> David H. Carter, Los Alamos National Laboratory, MS G770, Los Alamos NM 87545
<P>
Neutron diffraction measurements of internal elastic strains during mechanical deformation are performed on Be-50%Al. The material is produced from hot isostatically pressed powder which is rapidly solidified using a gas atomization process. Under rapid solidification, Be-A1 undergoes liquid phase separation, and upon complete solidification two intimately interpenetrating phases exist. The resulting microstructure can be described as a three-dimensional interpenetrating composite, where each phase is continuous. Strain measurements are taken at the Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Center (LANSCE) using a pulsed neutron source, which provides time-of-flight diffraction data. The elastic strains in the individual phases are measured as a function of applied stress. This data is used to quantify the deformation behavior of each phase. The A1 phase is highly constrained by the Be phase due to the morphology of the composite as well as the high stiffness and low Poisson's ratio of Be. The results provide more insight into the overall deformation behavior of Be-Al.

In our previous work, we prepared Al70Pd21Mn9 icosahedral quasicrystal by zone melting technique. The obtained sample contained fine lamellae of decagonal phase Al69Pd13Mn18. The Vickers indentation test revealed that the existence of fine lamellae and annealing improved the fracture toughness of the sample to be about 2.1 Mpam1/2 which is about 1.5 times as large as those without lamellae. In this paper, we will report the results of high temperature creep test of the sample with fine lamellae. We will also discuss the effects of decagonal lamellae on the high temperature plastic deformation of icosahedral phase, if possible. Detailed results will be presented at the meeting.

Powder metallurgy processing of Fe-Mn-Al alloys was studied. FeMn-Al alloy powder was produced by mechanical alloying of commercially available pure Fe, Mn, Al and C powder. The effect of ball milling, composition, pressure and sintering conditions on the microstructure and mechanical properties of resulted specimens were studied. For standard Fe-30Mn-lOAl-lC composition, 12 hour ball-milling is enough for producing the fcc structure of Fe-Mn-Al alloy after compaction and sintering at a temperature of 1240&#176;C or higher. It is found that the hardness, strength and ductility of the sintered specimens increase with sintering density. The specimen compacted with 800 MPa and sintered at 13260&#176;C for one hour in Ar have a sintered density of 6.18 g/cm3 (94.3% of theoretical density), hardness of HRC 32, and 0.2% offset yield strength of 1026 MPa. These mechanical properties are comparable to that of conventional casted material and are much better than that of the P/M carbon or stainless steels.

LOAD RELAXATION AND SUPERPLASTIC DEFORMATION BEHAVIOR OF A PB-SN ALLOY:</B> Tae Kwon Ha, Young Won Chang, Center for Advanced Aerospace Materials, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang 790-784, Korea
<P>
The deformation characteristics of Pb-Sn eutectic alloy, a typical microduplex superplastic material, has been investigated. For this purpose, a series of load relaxation tests has been conducted to obtain the flow curves under the condition of a constant structure and the results have consequently been analyzed based on the recently proposed internal variable theory of structural superplasticity. The effects of grain size and volume fraction of constituent phases on superplastic deformation behavior of this eutectic alloy has also been examined. The boundary sliding in this two phase alloy was characterized as a viscous flow process with the power index value of Mg=0.5. This value is much less than the previously reported value of Mg=1.0 for GBS obtained in several single phase alloys. The optimum strain rate is found to shift into a faster region as the grain size decreases.

MAGNETIC REFRIGERATION: </B><I>Karl A. Gschneidner, Jr.</I> and Vitalij K. Pecharsky, Ames Laboratory and Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011-3020
<P>
Magnetic refrigeration is based on the magnetocaloric effect (MCE), i.e. the temperature change (usually an increase) of a magnetic material near its mag netic ordering temperature due to the application of an external magnetic field. For many lanthanide materials the temperature increase is sufficiently large that one can utilize these materials as magnetic refrigerants. The best materials are those which order ferromagnetically and contain a heavy lanthanide metal Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, or Er, and possibly Nd, since the available magnetic entropy, and therefore, the cooling power is proportional to the total quantum number, J. Generally antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic and spin glass behaviors are not nearly as effective as ferromagnetic ordering. Studies to date have indicated that the MCE can be used as a method for the ligquefaction of cryogenic gasses, freezers for food processing plants, supermarket chillers and large scale building air conditioning.

1995 has seen a continuation of a positive trend in the Rare Earth industry. The availability of greater diversity of raw materials has brought additional flexibility to the producers permitting better economics. China remains the major raw material source; Chinese concentrate producers have increased capacity in 1995 (Baotou, Sichuan, etc..). China's role in the Rare Earth industry will continue to evolve; the acquisition of a majority equity position in Magnequench by San Huan will have significant impact on both the Rare Earth and Magnet markets.

The same economics will obviously apply to new technologies under development such as, for example, solid oxide fuel systems based on lanthanide-containing ceramics and nickel-lanthanide hydride battery systems. Their commercialization depends on the availability and the economic accessibility of suitable raw materials, and, in many cases, that will mean using <I>mixed</I>-lanthanide derivativesnot pure lanthanide compounds. The production process from ore to mixed-lanthanide derivatives will be traced.

The current status of metal hydride alloys for NiMH batteries was systematically reviewed. Extensive application-oriented R&amp;D has successfully made the NiMH batteries an important part, with growing potential, among rechargeable batteries. The rare earth-based metal hydrides (AB5) have been considered the best alloy material for use in the negative electrode in NiMH batteries. However, being in demand for high performance by electronic markets, the still young NiMH industry is facing serious technical challenges in developing better products. Among other efforts to respond to the challenges, advanced AB5 alloys are in great demand: the capacity enhancement race requires new or improved alloys processing higher volumetric capacity; high corrosion resistance when subjected to electrochemical cycling. Finally, price competition mandates MH materials with ow cost.

The outstanding thermal stability and high energy product make Sm (Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)z type alloys attractive for advanced applications. The near net-shape production of Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)z bonded magnets make them potentially superior to any magnets made by sintering. Although pioneering work done by Shimoda et al. And other investigators provide insights on the nominal compositional selection and process control of this alloy system, additional work is still necessary to improve our understanding of alloy behavior at various processing stages and to increase the production yield during powder processing. In this paper we report on the development of anisotropic Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)z alloy powders for the bonded bonded magnet application.

PREDICTION OF DUCTILE BEHAVIOUR IN WELDED STRUCTURES (DUCTILE TO BRITTLE TRANSITION BEHAVIOUR, SHEAR LIP, NOTCH ACQUITY, AND SPECIMEN SIZE):</B> <I>James R. Matthews</I>, Dockyard Laboratory, Department of National Defence, Defence Research Establishment, Atlantic, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia B2Y 3Z7, Canada
<P>
Design of ships against fracture requires, at the simplest level, that the minimum service temperature of the ship coincide with the upper shelf of the structural ductile to brittle transition curve for the steel and weldments. Material specifications in shipping standards often have no requirement for notch toughness and when they do specify toughness the specimen is of insufficient size and notch acquity to reflect the structural transition behaviour and to guarantee that the structure will be ductile at the lowest service temperatures. Consequently minimum standards should be adopted and specimen size and notch acquity requirements should be sufficient to predict ductile behaviour. In this paper, it will be shown that the transition behaviour for Charpy six specimens can be 50 to 100&#176;C below that for larger DT specimens. It will he shown that replacing the standard notch with an EDM notch in Charpy speci mens moves the transition curve towards the DT curve but as little as 20 degrees for some materials. This leaves the DT specimen as the simplest existing specimen whose transition behaviour would approximate that of a structure. Data will be presented for 350WT and A517 steels. Refinement of the DT specimen to include an EDM notch as opposed to a machined and pressed notch may marginally reduce cost of testing. Relying on a shear lip width transition curve as opposed to an energy based transition curve can reduce the cost considerably. Data will be presented to show that shear lip width is related to the fracture energy of specimens over a wide range of temperatures, compositions and weldment locations. Finally data will also be presented to show that the relationship between shear lip and energy is independent of specimen thickness between l6 mm and 25 mm thickness.

The present research examines the local stress and strain rates generated during loading in porous copper specimens produced by the GASAR gas-eutectic process, developed by Shapovalov and Timshenko. Two-dimensional explicit finite element simulations are performed on a representative microstructure taken from a 21.5 percent pore volume fraction bulk sample which contains high aspect ratio pores. The fraction bulk sample which contains high aspect ratio pores. The models investigate the role of multiple pore interactions and their effect on the mechanical properties of the porous materials. Previous research has shown the dependence of bulk strength and ductility on factors such as pore density, spacing, constraint and axial offset for uniaxial tensile loading. The present study extends the effort by applying biaxial and shear boundary conditions to the specimen, which simulates the effects of strain path on the deformation and fracture behavior of the porous materials. From these finite element models, the shape of the yield surface has been determined for the porous materials.

HIGH SPEED TEMPERATURE AND OPTICAL MEASUREMENTS OF DUCTILE FAILURE EVENTS IN METALS:</B> <I>Ares J. Rosakis</I>, G. Ravichandran, Raman P. Singh, Graduate Aeronautical Laboratories, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125
<P>
An experimental investigation has been conducted to study dynamic crack initiation in precracked highly ductile steel specimens. The specimens are fabricated out of 4340 mild steel and 304 stainless steel and subjected to dynamic three point bend loading by impacting them in a drop weight tower at various loading rates. This dynamic impact of the pre-cracked steel specimens results in deformation followed by fracture initiation at different loading rates. During the dynamic deformation and failure process the time history of the transient temperature and deformation fields around the crack tip are recorded experimentally. The transient temperatures are recorded using high speed infrared detectors, while the deformation fields are obtained using the optical method of Coherent Gradient Sensing (CGS) in conjunction with high speed photography. The experimental information is used to extract fracture parameters of interest, such as the time history of the dynamic J-integral (<I>Jd(t)</I>) and its critical value at initiation (<I>JdInitiation</I>) This is the first time that a noncontact temperature measurement is used to evaluate <I>Jd(t)</I>. The applicability and accuracy of this technique is validated through comparison with the simultaneously performed CGS optical measurements. Finally, the data provided by the two techniques is used to identify various ductile failure mechanisms and quantify the fracture initiation toughness in terms of <I>JdInitiation</I> at different loading rates.

We analyze transient plane-strain thermomechanical deformations of a pre-notched 4340 steel plate impacted by a 4340 steel projectile in the direction of two parallel notches, and study the influence of the impact speed and notch tip radius on the localization of the deformation. The plate configuration is identical to that in Kalthoff's experiments (1987, 1988). There is no failure or fracture criterion included in our work. However, the computed evolution of stress and plastic strain fields strongly suggest that with an increase of impact speed and decrease in notch tip radius, there is a failure mode transition from a tensile crack opening at approximately 70&#176; to the notch ligament to an adiabatic shear band propagating at (-5&#176;) - (-15&#176;) to the notch ligament. This is in qualitative agreement with Kalthoff's findings.

EFFECT OF STRAIN RATE ON THE FRACTURE TOUGHNESS REFERENCE TEMPERATURE To FOR FERRITIC STEELS:</B> <I>Kim Wallin</I>, Materials and Structural Integrity Department, VTT Manufacturing Technology, P.O. Box 1704, FIN-02044 VTT, Finland
<P>
The new master curve concept for describing materials fracture toughness in the transition region, with the help of a reference temperature <I>To</I>, is a candidate for structural integrity assessment codificaton. Normally, <I>To</I> is determined for (quasi) static strain rates, while often dynamic values are required. The master curve concept can of course be applied also to dynamic tests, but this would require a double amount of testing. Therefore, if the effect of strain rate on To can be quantified with sufficient accuracy, the applicability of the master curve concept for structural integrity assessment codification would be strongly enhanced. For this purpose, fracture toughness data found in the literature was analyzed with the master curve concept, and, using the Zeller-Hollomon strain rate parameter, a simple semiemperical expression for the strain rate dependence of <I>To</I> was developed. The error of the expression is only of the order &#177;20% covering yield strength levels from 200 to 1400 MPa.

DYNAMIC PLASTICITY OF DUCTILE MATERIALS AT THE MESOSCOPICAL SCALE LEVEL:</B><I> Yuri I. Mescheryakov</I>, Institute of the Mechanical Engineering Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences, Saint-Petersburg, V. O. Bolshoi 61, 199178, Russia
<P>
Dynamic tests of ductile materials (copper, aluminum, ductile steels) were carried out under uniaxial strain conditions to determine the criterion of transition between translational (shear banding) and rotational modes of deformation. All the basic processes defining the mode of plastic deformation were found to occur at the mesoscopical scale level (0.1 - 10 &#181;m) and depend on the particle velocity distribution at that level. The later has been recorded with a velocity interferometer modified for measuring both average mesoparticle velocity and particle velocity dispersion simultaneously. The kind of kinematical mechanism (translational or rotational) is determined by difference between longitudinal and transverse components of the mesoparticle velocity dispersion. This conclusion results from theoretical analysis of rotational motion of medium by using the mesomechanics approach.

High-density alloys and composites are employed as the penetrator core materials in modern armor-piercing projectiles. During ballistic impact with an armored target, the length of the penetrator core is eroded or back-extruded as a cavity is opened in the armor. The core material is deformed to very large strains at strain-rates exceeding 104 per second. The hydrostatic component of the stresses on the penetrator can exceed 5 GPa (1 Msi), suppressing void nucleation and growth as a fracture mechanism. However, plastic localization and failures (shear bands) are promoted by the high rate, adiabatic deformation. The ballistic performances of a number of high-density alloys and composites are compared. Deformation and failure behaviors are categorized via optical metallographic examinations of penetrators recovered from ballistic impacts.

ANALYTICAL MODELING OF THE SHEAR MODE AND OPENING MODE OF DUCTILE FRACTURE:</B> <I>G. Rousselier</I> and G. Barbier, Electricit&eacute; de France, Research Division, Les Renardi&egrave;res, F-77250 Moret-sur-Loing, France
<P>
Strain localization in the vicinity of a surface is a precursor to ductile fracture of materials. It can be analyzed by considering the stability of a linear perturbation. For a broad class of materials: plastic, rate-dependent, with void-growth damage and loading conditions: three-dimensional, thermomechanical and dynamic, a closed-form solution is obtained for the stability condition. From this condition, a mode of ductile fracture can be predicted: shear or opening. In a plastically incompressible material, the shear mode of fracture only is obtained; it results from a competition between strain hardening and thermal softening. In a void-growth damaging material, the opening mode is promoted by stress triaxiality. The analytical results are in agreement with experimental observations and numerical results from the literature.

Effects of inclusions on ductile fracture have been examined with laboratory produced Fe-42 pct Ni alloy. The inclusion volume fraction was varied between approximately 0.01 and 3.00 pct. Axisymmetric tensile bars and cylindrical, double shear test samples were tested in the recrystallized condition. In the tensile test, increasing inclusion volume fraction significantly reduced post-uniform elongation and strain to fracture . In the shear test, fracture displacement obtained from load-displacement data and strain to fracture calculated from shear test samples decreased with increasing inclusion volume fraction. The fracture behavior in tension and in shear is related to inclusion distribution. Applicability of different models is considered.

Fracture studies of high strength low alloy steels, at very high loading (strain rates) of up to equal to 107 were conducted using specially designed Split Hopkinson Bar equipped with a swing arm mechanism capable of fracturing CT specimens with a thickness of 12.7 mm. While it was possible to reproduce the load-displacement curves for the specimens, evaluation of the fracture toughness was mostly obtained from post-test examination of the stretch zone ahead of the crack using scanning electron microscopy. Several factors affecting the stretch zone were identified including the effect of fatigue precracking as well as the method of measurement of the stretch zone (nine point vs. three point approach). Significant differences in the stretch zone were observed which are attributed to the extent of the constraint factor ahead of the crack due to fatigue precracking which demonstrates the occurrence of some nonlinearity in the initial part of the J-Stretch Zone Width relationship.

NEUTRON IRRADIATION EFFECTS ON THE DUCTILE-BRITTLE TRANSITION OF FERRITIC/MARTENSITIC STEELS:</B> <I>Ronald L. Klueh</I> and D.J. Alexander, Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831
<P>
Below ~450&#176;C, neutron irradiation hardens the Cr-Mo ferritic/martensitic steels considered for future fusion power plants. Hardening reduces ductility, but the major effect is an increase in the ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) and a decrease in the upper-shelf energy (USE), as measured by a charpy impact test. After irradiation, DBTT values can increase to well above room temperature, thus increasing the chances of brittle rather than ductile fracture. Such a shift in DBTT could eliminate certain steels for nuclear applications. Steels are being developed for fusion applications that have a low DBTT prior to irradiation and then show only a small shift after irradiation. Low-chromium (3% Cr) and high-chromium (9% Cr) Cr-W steels are being investigated. A martensitic 9Cr-2WVTa (nominally Fe-9Cr-2W-0.25V-0.07Ta-0.1C) steel had a much lower DBTT than the conventional 9Cr-1MoVNb (Fe-9Cr-1Mo-0.25V-0.06Nb-0.1C) and 12Cr-1MoVW (Fe-12Cr-1Mo-0.25V-0.5W-0.5Ni-0.2C) steels prior to neutron irradiation and showed a much smaller increase after irradiation. The tantalum in 9Cr-2WVTa was concluded to affect the fracture stress. For the 3Cr steels, the type of bainitic microstructure formed during heat treatment affected the impact behavior. Granular bainite had inferior properties compared to an acicular bainite. Alloying was used to promote the acicular bainite. Improved toughness makes the steels candidates for both nuclear and non-nuclear applications.

A critical review on the heat transfer and fluid mechanical issues of spray forming will be presented. The paper will focus on those thermo-fluid issues which have important influence on the spray and solidification processes as well as the properties of the product, combining the perspectives of materials and manufacturing scientists and specialists in heat transfer and fluid mechanics. Among the topics to be considered are atomization, dynamics of sprays, including oversprays, droplet solidification, splat formation due to impact of liquid droplets and partially solidified particles with the substrate, heat transfer and solidification in the formed part, and residual stress formation. Emphases will be placed on current levels of understanding of the physics from a first principles point of view, semi-quantitative estimates of the length and time scales of interest, and current capabilities for accurate modeling and prediction. Recommendations for future research and development will also be made, based on results of the survey.

<P>
Several mechanisms have been recently identified as responsible for porosity formation in spray deposited materials. These mechanisms may be categorized according to their underlying fundamental nature; chemical (e.g., porosity generated by a foaming agent), physical (e.g, solidification shrinkage porosity), or dynamical (e.g., liquid-jet overflow). This investigation focuses on the latter category: pore formation mechanisms related to liquid metal flow and interactions between the flowing liquid metal and the irregular solid formed by the previously deposited droplets. These mechanisms are investigated using a combination of analytical models and detailed numerical simulations. The numerical model is based on a Navier-Stokes solver combined with the Volume Of Fluid method to track free surfaces. A multi directional algorithm is used to simulate the solidification process. The model case considered is that of liquid metal flooding of a random dense particle packing made of solidified droplets. Particular attention is devoted to cases where there is insufficient liquid to fill all the interstices and to capillary effects.

<B>NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF GAS ATOMIZATION IN SPRAY FORMING PROCESS:</B> <I>Huimin Liu</I>, Concurrent Technologies Corporation, 1450 Scalp Avenue, Johnstown, PA 15904
<P>
The spray forming process is emerging as a cost-effective manufacturing route for net and near-net shape preforms in a wide range of materials. In the past, numerical simulations have been made to model the melt delivery, the spray deposition, and the consolidation stages in the spray forming process. However, the atomization stage, particularly gas flow in the nozzle-close region and melt break-up kinetics, have not been adequately simulated. Atomization is a key stage in the spray forming process because it determines the size, size distribution, and initial conditions of the particles, hence, influences particle velocity, temperature, cooling rate, microstructure, and thus the mechanical properties of the spray-formed preforms. This work uses numerical tools to model atomization mechanisms. The full compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved to simulate the gas flow in the nozzle-close region. The melt flow and heat transfer are modeled on the basis of the boundary layer theory and the modified van Driest and Cebeci mixing-length turbulence model. The information on the flow and temperature fields obtained from the numerical simulation is then used to investigate melt break-up and droplet formation during atomization.

<P>
A detailed computational model of the spray metal forming process is being developed. The model provides process figures of merit, identify process control parameters, and help process design in support of the process development activity. The core of the model is an Eulerian-Lagrangian flow solver in which the gas phase is treated in an Eulerian framework involving the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations and the droplets are treated as a discrete phase involving single particle dynamics. Statistics are generated from the discrete phase by computing a large sample of particle &quot;trajectories&quot; in the force field due to the gas phase. In turn, particle statistics generate forces in the gas phase equations. Models are used in the discrete phase for particle drag, heat transfer, and solidification. The computer code is capable of handling complex three-dimensional geometries. Results will be presented showing details of the two-phase flow in a typical Osprey spray chamber; gas flow velocity and temperature distributions, gas flow and droplet interactions, droplet cooling curves and deposition profiles. Computed results will be compared with available experimental data.

An induction skull melting (ISM) spray forming process was used to investigate the spray atomization and deposition of tantalum alloys. Several systems were considered in order to tackle the scientific issues inherent to the spray forming of refractory metals in a gradual manner. Optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the spray formed materials and oversprayed powders. A theoretical and numerical analysis of the deposition and solidification of tantalum alloy droplets was conducted concurrently. This approach is based on a multi-directional solidification model combined with a Navier Stokes solver for flows with interfaces. Various droplet size and impact velocities consistent with the experiments were considered. The simulation results and the experimental data were compared and analyzed in order to identify the critical process parameters controlling the microstructure and porosity of as-deposited tantalum alloys.

A non-adiabatic calorimetric method was developed and used to determine the enthalpy of droplets in a spray as a function of flight distance with the purpose of providing critical information for the controlled spray forming using uniform-droplet sprays (UDS). A UDS consists of droplets that are uniform in size and thermal history and can be used to produce a variety of novel deposit microstructures in a controlled manner. Such controlled spray forming, however, requires thorough characterization of the thermal state of the uniform droplets. The calorimetric method developed accounts for the heat loss that occurs while collecting the droplets in the calorimeter, and uses a data acquisition system for in-situ determination of droplet enthalpy. Comparison of measured droplet enthalpy values and those predicted by model calculations shows a very good agreement.

The spray forming process offers advantages for both material properties and process technology. A deeper understanding of the spray forming process, with particular concern to the complex disintegration phase and the formation of the deposit. The present work introduces an experimental set-up to investigate the in-flight behavior of sprayed droplets. In a chamber with controlled atmosphere, a spray cone is wire. This process allows to skip the complete melting unit of a spraying facility and facilitates maintaining a spraying experiment for a desired period of time (a couple of minutes generally) and changing the set of parameters for the next experiment within minutes in order to save time diameter and feed rate, laser beam power and intensity, and atomizing gas flow. During spraying of mild steel with nitrogen, the nitrogen content of droplets sampled at various locations within the spray cone is investigated. The results of the in-flight interaction of the sprayed dropletes with the ambient atmosphere are discussed.

A finite difference based fluid dynamics software program, FLUENT, has been used to model the 2-dimensional dynamic and thermal behaviour of Udimet 720 droplets during gas atomisation and spray forming. The effect of atomising gas pressure pressure, spray distance and melt mass flow rate (MFR) on the equilibrated droplet spray temperature has been examined and the predictions compared with measured maximum deposit temperatures from spray forming experiments performed under the same process conditions. The predicted spray temperatures at the substrate were always higher than the measured deposit temperatures under all conditions, and were found to increase with (I) decreasing gas pressure, (ii) decreasing spray distance, and (iii) increasing MFR. Mean droplet temperatures and velocities were found to be strongly dependent on droplet size with mean droplet temperature decreasing, and mean droplet axial velocities increasing, with decreasing droplet size.

MAKING LINKS BETWEEN GRAIN BOUNDARY CHARACTER DISTRIBUTIONS AND POLYCRYSTALLINE PROPERTIES:</B> <I>Alexander H. King</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794-2275
<P>
Automated orientation analysis makes it possible to perform an &quot;epidemiological&quot; kind of materials research in which the occurrence of certain types of grain boundary is associated with certain types of polycrystalline property. What is left out of many studies of this kind, however, is the causal link that relates a certain grain boundary character distribution to a particular polycrystalline behavior. In this presentation, I will caution that focusing upon the grain boundary character in terms of &quot;small-angle,&quot; &quot;coincidence-related&quot; and &quot;general&quot; categories can be misleading. I will provide a number of examples to show that these are not always the important (or desirable) features of the grain boundary character distribution, drawing my illustrations from work on high-Tc superconductors and metallic polycrystalline thin films. Finally, if time permits, I will comment upon the characterization of triple-junctions and show, once again, that currently popular types of characterization are seriously misleading.

THE STRUCTURE OF DEFORMATION INDUCED HIGH ANGLE BOUNDARIES:</B> <I>D.A. Hughes</I>, Materials and Engineering Sciences Center, Sandia National Labs., Livermore, CA 94550
<P>
Internal interfaces develop during deformation at the places where grains subdivide. Some of these interfaces develop into high angle boundaries that subsequently have a large effect on the materials properties including local crystallographic textures, flow strength and annealing behavior. The structure of very high angle boundaries (&gt;30=B0) formed during deformation by dislocations and texture processes was examined using transmission electron microscopy and convergent beam diffraction. The large misorientation angles that develop by these processes are similar to those angles encountered in ordinary grain boundaries. These boundaries are characterized according to their angle/axis pair, boundary plane, tilt/twist character, thickness, sigma value and their association with trapped glide dislocations. In general these boundaries have a complex character and are not low sigma boundaries. The structure of these deformation induced boundaries is then compared to that of equilibrium grain boundaries such as those that form during recrystallization.

The brittle nature at low temperatures of Laves phase intermetallic compounds remains a major obstacle to the use of these complex-structured materials for their excellent high temperature properties. Deformation by twinning is seen as a possible mechanism by which to obtain acceptable levels of ductility and toughness at low temperatures. In this paper, the microstructures of a cubic HfV2+Nb Laves phase is studied before and after compressive deformation using conventional and high-resolution electron microscopy. The Laves phase occurs as precipitates within a matrix of a V-Nb bcc solid solution. In the underformed material, narrow stacking defects with thicknesses of from one to three times the (111) interplanar spacing are seen lying on the (111) crystallographic planes. The distribution of these defects is anisotropic on the mesoscopic scale with spacings ranging from approximately 2 nm to over 200 nm. The deformed material shows extensive twinning of the Laves phase precipitates. The twins occur in clusters and twin bands as small as 2 nm in width are seen. Analysis of the structure of the stacking defects and twins and comparisons between the mesoscopic distributions of stacking defects in the undeformed materials and twins in the deformed materials will be presented.

DISSOCIATION MECHANISMS FOR EXTRINSIC GRAIN BOUNDARY DISLOCATIONS: </B> <I>S.G. Song</I>, J.S. Vetrano, S.M. Bruemmer, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352
<P>
The plastic deformation of grain boundaries (GBs) is central to the understanding of a wide range of materials behavior including superplasticity and creep. In analogy to the bulk deformation carried out microscopically by lattice dislocations, GB deformation cannot occur without the involvement of grain boundary dislocations (GBDs). The present investigation examines the stability of extrinsic GBDs in Al alloys. It is found that the dissociation of extrinsic GBDs not only is a function of temperature but also of other variables such as solute content and GB structures. Given a boundary structure, the Burgers vectors of the secondary GBDs, resulting from the dissociation of extrinsic GBDs in general GBs, can be predicted based on the DSC-lattice. The visibility of the secondary dislocations varies with the magnitude of their Burgers vectors. The GBD stability of different boundary misorientations is compared so that common properties of grain boundary plastic behavior can be drawn.

EFFECT OF THE MAGNITUDE OF GRAIN BOUNDARY DISLOCATION BURGERS VECTORS O DISSOCIATION OF EXTRINSIC GRAIN BOUNDARY DISLOCATIONS:</B> <I>S.G. Song</I>, J.S. Vetrano, S.M. Brummer, Structural Materials Interfaces, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352
<P>
The concept of Burgers vectors of secondary grain boundary dislocations (SGBDs), resulting from the dissociation of extrinsic grain boundary dislocations (EGBDs), in general grain boundaries can be extrapolated from those of GBDs in CSL boundaries. Increasing CSL boundary index results in the decrease in magnitude of the basis vectors of the corresponding DSC lattice on which the Burgers vectors of the SGBDs are determined. There exists a critical size of the elementary Burgers vectors of the dissociated grain boundary dislocations. Below this value, an EGBD disappears eventually after the SGBDs resulting from the dissociation spread to a sufficient distance that is dependent on temperature and instrument parameters. On the other hand, the resulting SGBDs are always visible if their Burgers vectors are above the critical size.

Internal reduction of transition metal doped mixed oxides yields formation of fine dispersion of metal particles within the oxide matrix. Selection of special reaction parameters like oxygen partial pressure gradient, reaction temperature, chemical composition of the mixed oxide and the type of matrix oxide and dopant allows to control the microstructure of the reduced scale, the morphology of the metal precipitates and the fine-structure of the metal-ceramic interfaces down to an atomic scale. Experimental results for different mixed oxides containing magnesia, alumina or zirconia will be reported. Growth and thermodynamical equilibrium shapes of the precipitates will be presented. Precipitate morphology, relative orientation relationship and interface fine structure will be interpreted in terms of the diffusion field (which allows the metal precipitation), the chemical reaction at the precipitate interface, the interface energy and its anisotropy and the mechanical response of the system to solid state reaction related stresses.

INTERFACIAL DEBONDING IN MULTI-LAYER THIN FILM SYSTEMS</B>: <I>X.H. Liu</I>, C.F. Shih, Division of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912
<P>
To improve the reliability of electronic devices, it is important to understand the interfacial debonding of multi-layer thin film systems. The interfacial fracture energy can be measured experimentally using a sandwich four-point bending specimen. This interfacial fracture energy includes both the intrinsic debonding energy of the metal/ceramic interface and the plastic dissipation in the metal layers. The plastic dissipation makes a substantial contribution to the interfacial fracture energy. In contrast to the plastic dissipation, which depends on the layer thickness, the intrinsic debonding energy is a material property of the interface and is important in the evaluation of interface adhesion and design of multi-layers. A micromechanical model is used to investigate interfacial debonding. From the model the intrinsic debonding energy can be obtained using the measured interfacial fracture energy. The effects of interfacial adhesion and metal layer properties on the interfacial fracture energy are discussed.

Multicomponent Mg-Y-Cu lightweight alloys were prepared by mechanical alloying of elemental powder mixtures. The progress of alloying, the resulting phases and their thermal stability were characterised by x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA). Coexistent amorphous and nanoscale crystalline phases are found for a variety of alloys with different composition. The thermal stability data of the materials as obtained by constant-rate heating DSC and TMA measurements and isothermal annealing experiments are discussed with respect to phase separation in the undercooled liquid state and nucleation and growth of nanocrystalline phases. Some characteristic properties of the glassy phase are presented and discussed with respect to the composition dependence of the glass transition and the crystalline temperature. The results are compared with data for melt-quenched samples. Finally, the influence of processing conditions and contamination effects during milling on the phase formation and the thermal stability of the mechanically attrited powders is critically assessed.

Creep mechanisms were analyzed in some details and compared with each other. Two distinctive creep mechanisms have been observed depending on the testing stress and temperature, ie, Coble creep at low stresses and temperatures and dislocation creep at high stresses and temperatures. True creep activation energies in dislocation creep regime were calculated using modified semi-emperical creep equation. The calculated values were in good agreement with that for self lattice diffusion in pure aluminium. The diffusional (Coble) creep regime significantly enlarged to high stress and temperature region with an increase of Si content due to an increasing volume fraction of dispersiods.

The production of large quantities of contamination free mechanically alloyed powders from titanium and nickle based materials has proven to be a major challenge. Feasibility of such a goal can be carried out, at laboratory level, by any milling device like the very common planetary ball mill. In this case however, the possibility of a subsequent scaling up for larger production is hindered by the intrinsic limits of a planetary ball mill design. On the contrary the horizontal Zoz attritor can be experimented at laboratory level using small volume chamber-units (0.25, 0.5, and 2.1) and, for industrial production, using the large volume units (up to 400 1) based on the same conceptual design. Therefore, experiments have been conducted on blended elemental Ti-Ni compositions in the proportions Ti-51.5Ni, Ti-50Ni, Ti-49.5Ni and Ti-48.5Ni (at %) using a Zoz attritor with a small unit-chamber (0.51). Due to the inherent ductility of the powder, the material has the tendency to adhere to the grinding unit and the grinding media. Further, in order to avoid high contamination and to make the process realistic from an economical point of view, the milling time has to be reduced to a minimum. The above points identify a Critical Milling Behaviour (CMB) of the system under investigation that must be kept under control to achieve the wanted goal. It will be shown by the present paper that by adopting a suitable milling and discharging procedure (Cycle Operation by Operation Cycle and Discharging Cycle) low contamination and good yield have been substantially achieved. This is investigated by chemical analysis, by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction.

Mechanical alloying and hot isostatic pressing techniques were employed to synthesise a fully dense Ti-47.5AJ-3Cr alloy containing equipped nanocrystalline <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">TiA1 grains. Isothermal annealing was conducted at 1200&#176;C (above the eutectoid transformation temperature) at holding times of 5, 10, 25 and 35 hours. Analytical transmission electron microscopy investigations revealed the presence of a dual structure comprising <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> laths and equipped g grains some of which were twinned. The grains coarsened during annealing and the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> laths were formed during cooling as a result of the eutecroid transformation. At the maximum annealing time studied (35 hours), the average grain size of grains was about 2 mm and the width of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> laths was -0.3mm.

Gamma TiA1 based compacts were synthesized by hot isostatic pressing (HIP'ing) a mixture of pre-alloyed Ti-48A1-2Nb-2Cr gas atomized and mechanically alloyed powders. Mechanical alloying of the initial powder was performed in a SPEX mill for 15 hours. HIP'ing was conducted at 850&#176;C under 206 MPa pressure. Two different volume proportions of the gas atomized and mechanically alloyed powders were utilized in the HIP'ing process. This allowed production of microstructures in HIP'd compacts: a homogeneous nanocrystalline structures, when 100% mechanically alloyed powder was used, and a bimodal structure consisted of the mixture of micron-sized and nono-sized grains, when the compacts were HIP'd from a blend of the gas atomized and mechanically alloyed powders. Evolution of the microstructure during mechanical alloying and HIP'ing was studied by XRD, SEM and TEM techniques.

FLOW AND COOLING CHARACTERISTICS OF AL-SI DROPLETS/PARTICLES DURING GAS ATOMIZATION</B>: Seong-Yeon Yoo, Sang-Yoon Lee; Rapidly Solidified Materials Research Center, Department of Mechanical Design Engineering, Chungnam National University, Taejon, 305-764, KOREA
<P>
There are two important parameters in gas atomization - particle size and cooling rate. These two parameters are mainly controlled by gas flow and heat transfer between gas and droplets/particles. The purpose of this research is to investigate flow structure, cooling rate and trajectory of Al-Si droplets/particles by numerical simulation. Gas flow is simulated using finite volume method, and particle trajectory is simulated using Eulerian method. Rosin-Rammler formula is used for the particle size distribution. Gas field influences particle trajectory, reversely particles alter the gas field. So momentum and heat exchange between gas and particles are calculated by iterative method. Particle trajectory is found to depend on particle size, the location of particle formation, and turbulent motion of gas. Cooling rate of particles is calculated by taking into account latent heat of melt and local heat transfer between particle and gas. Small particle cools down rapidly, while large diameter particles solidifies very slowly.

PREPARATION OF Ti POWDER BY A MECHANICAL MILLING INDUCED REDUCTION REACTION: </B>E.G. Baburaj, Kevin T. Hubert, Carl Powell, C. Suryanarayana, and F.H. Froes, IMAP, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID 83844-3026
<P>
A displacement reaction between TiC14and Mg, induced by mechanical milling, has been employed for preparation of fine Ti powder. The present work shows the possibility of considerable reduction in milling time by the use of pre-milled Mg which enhances the reactivity due to an increase in surface area and surface activity. The milled product has been leached repeatedly to obtaining pure Ti. The reaction products before and after leaching have been examined by XRD, SEM, and TEM. The product after leaching, as determined by XRD is pure Ti. The particle size, as observed by TEM is in the range of 5-200nm. The EDX analysis of individual crystals or agglomerates using TEM, does not show the presence of chloride. Small amount of oxygen and nitrogen as impurities have been detected. Further work on the analysis of the powder is in progress.

Rapidly solidified Al-Li-Cu-Mg alloys prepared by argon atomization process were investigated. Using cold compaction and canning, the powder was hot extruded into a bar of diameter 17 mm. Compared with traditional ingot metallurgy alloys, the microstructure and properties of rapidly solidified powder metallurgy alloys has been significantly improved. The effects of adding minor Zr, Ag or rare earth (RE) Nd and La on the Al-Li-Cu-Mg alloys are different. Minor Zr and Ag can efficiently accelerate the ageing process and increase the strength and hardness of alloys. Minor RE raises the ductility. The microstructure of alloys forms due to precipitation process of metastable binary phase Al(3)Li, ternary Tl-phase Al(2)CuLi with hexagonal crystal structure, and also tetragonal metastable phases on base of Al(2)Cu. These three coexistent channels of phase transformations are responsible for strengthening of alloys during subsequent ageing. The particle size of atomized powder for alloys was in the range of 10-150nm, but after optimal thermo-mechanical treatments the microstructure of alloys has been significantly dispersed and more refined. The grains are more homogeneous and have a nano-scale size on the average. In this state particles of this phase has a globula form and preferably heterogenuons nucleation at consequent aging.

WASTE DISPOSAL BY RESIDUE RECYCLING AT KGHM POLSKA MIEDZ SA:</B> <I>Helena Byrdziak,</I> Jerzy Dobrzanski, Jan Garbaczewski, Janusz Piatkowski, KGHM Polska Miedz SA, P-59300 Lubin, Ul. Sklodowskiej 48, Poland
<P>
KGHM Polska Miedz SA, existing since seventies, operates three underground mines and three smelters with local production of over 400,000 mtpy of electrolytic copper. Its impact on the environment, very serious in the past, has been gradually reduced, In general, recently emission into the air and water has been put under control. Nowadays tailings and residues disposal has turned to be the subject of first environmental importance. The total bulk of tailings is enormous as copper ore contains only about 2% of copper, so 98% of extracted material must be disposed gradually in each step of technology. The main Streams are tailings from the flotation, slags, captured dust from dedusting systems and gaseous compounds like SO2 and CO. Much effort has already been done and is still being done to utilize them for by-products production or to dispose them within the process by recycling. The most effective measures taken up so far and present activity towards waste disposal are presented.

Printed circuit boards (PCBs) of varying compositions have been converted by incineration, followed by smelting to an environmentally stable slag and a copper-nickel-tin alloy, containing the precious metals. The environmentally compatibility of the slag was established according to the German Standard DIN 38414, Part 4. The concentration of toxic elements in the lixiviates was found to be lower than the threshold value for drinking water (CE-Standards). In each experiment the charge was 500 g scrap from PCBs and 100 g flux. The products were a king of mullite slag, poor in iron, which was recirculated, and an alloy containing up to 0.3% gold. With a burner the process gas was combusted without soot formation and the generated mixed zinc-lead oxide fume containing silver was separated as flue dust.

COPPER FROM COPPER BEARING SCRAP, A MOVING TARGET:</B> Albert W. Spitz, <I>Robert A. Spitz</I>, Michael Saltzburg, 560 Bedford St., B-12, Abington, MA 02351
<P>
Profitably recovering copper and precious metals from copper bearing scrap is a demanding and frustrating combination of art, science and economics. With fluctuating markets, varying raw materials and increasingly stringent environmental regulations requiring process revisions, practically everything is changing. The volatile copper market constantly shifts the percentage of copper in the scrap that can be economically processed. Scrap that has value one day may incur a disposal cost the following day. Also with less copper in the scrap, more residuals, slag, fume, etc. are generated which frequently present disposal problems and infrequently generate income. The ever increasing amounts of electronic scrap add value to the copper produced by virtue of the precious metals present. Printed circuit board materials create more slag and organic off gases which must be treated. Finally, the emphasis on reducing emissions of organics and other metals, especially lead, is a continuing challenge. Stack gases, fugitive emissions and ambient air quality all demand constant surveillance.

CHANGES IN THE DUST HANDLING SYSTEM AT HUDSON BAY MINING &amp; SMELTING CO., LTD: </B><I>Keith McTaggart</I>, Hudson Bay Mining &amp; Smelting Co., Ltd, P.O. Box 1500, Flin Flon, Manitoba R&amp;A 1N9, Canada
<P>
The waste gas cleaning system of the Hudson Bay Mining &amp; Smelting copper smelter in Flin Flon, MB, consists of an electrostatic precipitator followed by a baghouse. These units collect the copper and zinc bearing dusts, respectively, from the gas streams of the reberberatory furnace and Pierce-Smith converting furnaces. A process change in 1993 led to the rapid destruction of the existing baghouse fibreglass filter bags, shortening their life-span from 15 to 3 months. A decision was made in September 1994 to replace this type of filter media with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane filter supplied by W.L. Gore Associates, Inc. Following the original installation a dramatic increase in dust capture was observed, however high pressure drops across the filter material lead to decreased flow through the off-gas handling system, limiting ventilation of the process. This increase in pressure drop across the PTFE bags was a function of the PTFE material and the inability of the baghouse shaker system to release the dust layer from the PTFE bags. Recently acoustic horns have been tested as a replacement to the shaker cleaning mechanism. Preliminary results indicate a dramatic reduction in pressure drop across the bags and a subsequent increase in process ventilation. This allows for fewer production interruptions caused by fugitive process emissions. The final acoustic horn results will be presented.

THE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF AUSMELT TECHNOLGY IN SECONDARY COPPER SMELTING AND CONVERTING:</B> Edward N. Mounsey, Ausmelt Ltd., 12 Kitchen Rd., Dandenong 3175, Victoria, Australia; Norbert L. Piret, Piret &amp; Stolberg Partners, Im Licht 12, D-47279 Duisburg, Germany
<P>
The requirements to smelt secondary copper more economically, to process a wide range of materials with large fluctuation in size and composition and to cope with the increasingly stringent environmental constraints have put considerable pressure on existing conventional secondary copper smelters. The Top Submerged Lance (TSL) process, developed and commercialized by Ausmelt Ltd over the past 20 years, offers a low cost technology, which is particularly suitable for the treatment of copper-bearing scrap and residues, because of its low investment, use of cheap fuel and reductant, high rate of recovery of metals and low slag losses, potential use of oxygen, high flexibility with regard to feed material, applicability to high and low throughputs, absence of dioxins in the process gas, simplicity of handling of feed, process gas and slags. This presentation outlines the application of Ausmelt technology in secondary copper smelting, producing converter grade copper ready for anode furnacing, both for a new installation and for a retrofit of the smelting or converting stage of an existing smelter. The economic and environmental benefits of its application are highlighted.
