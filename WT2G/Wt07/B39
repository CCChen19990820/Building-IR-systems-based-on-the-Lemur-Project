<H1>TVM-49: Iron Free Vitamins & Minerals Foundational Nutrients</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COMPREHENSIVE </H2>

<P>  TVM-49 is one of the most comprehensive, nutritional supplements ever formulated.  It is the Life Plus basic, nutritional insurance policy for adults and older children. No other product in its category begins to compare with it when you consider the quality and quantity of ingredients, its broad spectrum base and cost per unit of nutrients.</P>
<P>  The body requires a good balance of a wide variety of nutrients as more than one nutrient is usually involved in each individual biochemical reaction in the body. If even one of those nutrients is lacking, the natural health supporting chain reaction cannot take place. If such a lack persists, the body will eventually suffer some form of degeneration or disease.</P>
<P>  TVM-49 is a unique, broad spectrum nutritional supplement TVM-49 ensures the necessary nutrients classified as present in a rational relationship and with numerous synergistic associated nutrients, including many ultra-trace elements, so they can work together harmoniously.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BE SURE WITH TVM-49</H2>
<P>  TVM-49 goes far beyond just vitamins and minerals. It is manufactured by strictly controlled cold processing methods and contains many "super foods" such as Lecithin, Bee Pollen, Kelp and Bioflavonoids. These "super foods" contain many nutritional factors, presently unknown, which could be very essential to good health. The Life Plus proprietary PhytoZyme tablet base contains over thirty natural phytochemical plant concentrates from foods such as broccoli, carrot, cauliflower and several others. TVM-49 also contains the valuable special amino acids L-Glutamic Acid, L-Glutamine and L-Tyrosine, known not just for their traditional value, but for their more newly understood value against brain aging.
  TVM-49 contains numerous trace and ultra-trace minerals such as Chromium, Selenium, Vanadium (as Vanadyl Sulfate), Molybdenum, Germanium, Silicon and Boron, most of which are not contained in other multi-vitamin and mineral products on the market today.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT ABOUT IRON?</H2>
<P>  Iron is intentionally not included in this great formula as it is becoming more apparent that only a small number of people need iron supplements.  Men, in particular, usually do not need iron but some women do. It is believed that the reason some diseases, particularly heart disease and cancer, are more prevalent in men is that they do not routinely lose some of their iron through menstruation as women do. It is now known that excess iron can be responsible, or at least involved, in the production of damaging free radicals in the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT ABOUT MEGA VITAMINS?</H2>
<P>  At Life Plus, we do not believe in taking large amounts of all the vitamins and minerals routinely on a daily basis. At times, the use of larger amounts of certain nutrients, such as Vitamin A, C or E may be worthwhile. You may want to use larger amounts of certain amino acids or enzymes.   TVM-49 supplies you with a substantial amount of about every nutrient the average person needs daily.  Four tablets a day will give you 100% of the RDA of everything except calcium and magnesium. TVM-49 contains calcium and magnesium, but due to their sheer bulk, six tablets are required to obtain the full RDA quantities.</P>
<P>  Our bodies are simply fantastic! If we furnish them with adequate amounts of the required nutrients, combined with a reasonable lifestyle, they maintain themselves against the various toxicants they are exposed to   each   day. Because our foods do not contain the quantities of nutrients they did in the past, and because we are exposed to more pollutants in our environment, in the foods we eat and the water we drink, it only makes sense to supplement daily with TVM-49.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  TVM-49 is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE TVM-49 </H2>
<P>It is recommended that children over twelve years of age and adults take four tablets each day, usually two tablets with breakfast and two with the evening meal for the nutritional insurance you need.  You may add to your program as desired with such products as <A HREF="hcalmag.htm">CALMAG
PLUS</A>,  <A HREF="hopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS</A>, <A HREF="hmagicm.htm">INNER MAGIC M</A> or <A HREF="hmagicf.htm">INNER MAGIC F</A> depending on your needs.  Strongly consider the <A HREF="hsyn.htm">Life Plus SYNERGY PAK</A>; it contains TVM-49 and three other synergistic foundational products making a great foundational nutrient supplement program.</P>

<H1>MICRO-MINS: Plant Derived Colloidal Minerals</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TYPES OF MINERALS </H2>

  <P> Three different types exist, metallic, chelated and colloidal.   Metallic minerals are most commonly used in nutritional supplements, especially for the major minerals because larger amounts are indicated. They have the least degree of absorption. Chelated minerals are the next step up the ladder. The metallic mineral is "chelated" with an amino acid. The "mineral chelate" is more bioavailable.  Colloidal Minerals occur in nature as small particles that either are or can be easily dispersed in a dispersion medium. Plant Derived Colloidal Minerals provide the best of all worlds because they are colloidal in nature and are associated with natural plant tissues, giving them all of the advantages of chelated minerals and more. Erosion and unwise farming methods have made mineral-rich soil a rare commodity.  The result is mineral deficient plants and livestock, and mineral-deficient people.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ORGANIC HUMIC SHALE</H2>
<P>    The best quality plant derived colloidal minerals in the world are concentrated from the mineral rich natural organic humic shale in the Rockland Mine. About 75 million years ago, the Earth's mineral-rich soils produced succulent fruits, vegetables and lush forests. The soils contained at least 84 minerals, which is why some experts believe some trees grew ten feet the first year.</P>
 <P>   Plant and animal life was extremely healthy and it is believed that a major reason is a direct result of the plants' access to at least 77 minerals from the soil. This is a far cry from the number of minerals available from the average soil throughout the world today. As the lucious vegetation died, it accumulated in deposits. It was compressed or compacted so that all of the moisture in it was eliminated.  What remains today is a deposit of dried, prehistoric plant derivatives known as organic humic shale.</P>
<P>   This organic humic shale contains 77 plant derived hydrophilic minerals which are very small in size when compared to metallic minerals. Because the minerals in humic shale were assimilated by plants, they are naturally incorporated into the tissues of the plant and are more hydrophilic and more readily utilized</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COLLOIDS AND COLLOIDAL SOLUTIONS </H2>
<P>Colloidal science is devoted to the study of systems in which finely divided substances (colloids) are dispersed within a medium. A colloidal system can be a solid dispersed in a gas, solid-in-solid, solid-in-liquid, gas-in-gas, gas-in-liquid, liquid-in-liquid. etc. A colloidal system is not really a solution in which one substance is totally dissolved into the other hand, a colloidal system it is not really a suspension either.  In a suspension, the particles of the substance being suspended are larger and remain in the solid state.</P>
 <P>   Some people do not realize that solids can be colloids. A colloid is one thing and a colloidal solution is another.  A colloidal solution is merely a system in which a colloid has been dispersed in a liquid. Most all of the so-called colloidal mineral nutritional products on the market today are liquids. Actually, most of them are not true colloids at all. They have been manufactured by extracting some source material such as shale, clay or sea bed with citric or some other kind of acid. In this process, the acid helps dissolve the minerals and breaks down much of the organic matter in the source material, which occurs naturally associated with the minerals.  This acid extraction can actually destroy the plant-derived colloidal nature of most minerals and trace elements.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE ROCKLAND PROCESS</H2>
 <P>   The proprietary low-temperature Rockland process uses only cool, contaminant free water.  By maintaining low temperatures, the integrity of the natural delicate state of plant derived minerals is maintained.  A major advantage of the finished product is that the super highly concentrated plant-derived colloidal material is maintained in its natural state and can be easily hydrated by water to become a colloidal solution.</P>
<P>    The humic shale is mined in the natural dry state as it has existed for millions of years.  It is then ground to smaller aggregates and placed in stainless steel vats, where it is leached slowly. No acids are used. Negative pressure is applied which makes the concentration more efficient at low temperatures. Only the water is removed and the solid plant-derived colloidal minerals are all that are present, but in a highly concentrated form.</P>
<P>    When the leaching is complete, the mother liquor contains 38.000 milligrams of the 7 major minerals and 70 trace minerals per quart of liquid. When dried, the colloidal powder is placed in capsules of 600 mg each so that one capsule is equivalent to one half ounce of liquid, in so far as mineral content is concerned.</P>
<P>   This unique method makes it possible to have a dry product that can be made into capsules containing high quality plant-derived colloidal minerals just as they were in their natural state. When swallowed with water, the minerals in Micro-Mins capsules readily return to their liquid colloidal state in the digestive tract and provide all the advantages of the liquid form without the disadvantages.</P>
<P>    Metallic minerals carry a positive charge in their ionic Form in solution and, in general, are just not very soluble. Scientifically, they are called hydrophobic because they are not very soluble in water. Minerals that have been assimilated by plants are hydrophilic, so they are very water soluble. They are negatively charged and form direct hydrogen bonds with water. Hydrophilic plant-derived minerals, which have not been destroyed by heat or acids or other chemicals, are enzymatically active and thus are highly bioavailable.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ALUMINUM IN OUR FOODS</H2>
<P>   Some people believe that the so-called toxic metals (minerals) are bad regardless of their source. Aluminum is found in the earth is, its metallic form. There is no question about its metallic form, which is well documented that it can be leached from aluminum cooking utensils and absorbed from antiperspirants and deposited in both brain and heart tissue. However, the aluminum, which comes from food, is hydrophilic as it has been assimilated by plants and it is naturally tied to oxygen or silica. The World Health Organization estimates the average adult dietary aluminum intake between 10 and 15 mg per day. Aluminum is one of the most abundant minerals on earth, second only to silica. It is in virtually everything we touch, most of the air we breathe and water we drink. It is in most foods that we eat.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE MICRO-MINS</H2>
<P>   No RDAs are established for most of the minerals in Micro-Mins, however it is known that many are needed for optimum health. They are packaged in bottles of 64 capsules making it convenient for the ideal dosage of two capsules twice a day for two weeks, or two capsules daily for a 30 day supply.</P>

<H1>BERRY'D TREASURE: Plant Derived Colloidal Minerals in Convenient Liquid Form </H1>
<BR>
 
<P>We now know that trace minerals are just as important to our overall health as vitamins. Life Plus has bottled 77 colloidal minerals in a pleasant berry flavored liquid. BERRY'D TREASURE provides the benefits of plant derived colloidal minerals. The value of minerals in the support of good health is becoming more realized by thousands of individuals. Everything on the earth, even the earth itself,
is built on a foundation of minerals. They are a part of the structure of our connective and supportive tissues and are components of our hormones and enzymes, which are responsible for our biochemical life.</P>

<H2>TRACE MINERALS</H2>
<P>Trace minerals are only required in small amounts, sometimes smaller than the
eye can see. But this small quantity should not mean they are any less important.
A deficiency in any of them can be just as serious as any major mineral
deficiency. Nowhere is there a more powerful or effective means of obtaining
them than by taking Life Plus BERRY'D TREASURE.</P>

<P>Each tablespoon contains 600 mg of 77 plant derived colloidal minerals. They
have been concentrated by a proprietary process, using only cool, 
contaminant-free water to maintain high bioavailability and colloidal
nature.</p>


<H2>HEALING THE BODY AND THE LAND</H2>
<P> The people of the rainforest have used plants found deep in the jungle for centuries to enhance vitality and overall health. This ancient wisdom is now available through BERRY'D TREASURE and other unique Life Plus RAINFORCE products. They bring you the benefits of highly effective natural herbal and plant extracts, harvested ecologically to preserve the natural resources of the rainforest and its people. Financial contributions are made supporting improved economics and education of the indigenous people.

<H1>VITA-C-1000 TR: Timed Released Buffered Vitamin C Plus Bioflavonoids</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NEEDS VARY </H2>

<P>  Vitamin C is the most talked about and most studied vitamin.   It naturally reinforces hundreds of defense mechanisms in the body. With the exception of man, almost all other animals are able to manufacture their own. However, we must obtain it from food or supplements.</P>
<P>   Individual needs for Vitamin C vary from person to person and from day to day, according to the types and amount of stress that is experienced.  Dr. Linus Pauling, the world's leader in Vitamin C research, consistently took 6,000 mg per day for years, which he considered to be the absolute minimum, even though the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) is only 60 mg per day. Most doctors and scientist agree that we routinely need more since the RDA was determined to be enough to only prevent scurvy.</P>
<P>   Those who live in cities or near busy highways may suffer from carbon monoxide and lead poisoning. In large doses, Vitamin C has been shown to have a protective effect of pulling the carbon monoxide away from the hemoglobin in the red blood cells, so the oxygen can become attached and be carried to the cells.</P>
<P>   Pregnant women who take adequate amounts of Vitamin C have less problem with leg cramps, fluid retention and toxemia.</P>
<P>   It  has  been  proven  that  Vitamin  C  increases  certain biochemical reactions in white blood cells that kill bacteria. There are many bacteria, viruses, and allergies which can be associated in various ways with colds.  Vitamin C does not provide complete protection against all of them. Nonetheless, your odds are probably better while taking it.</P>
<P>   If you smoke one pack of cigarettes a day, you have about 25C/o less Vitamin C in your blood than non-smokers.  Those who drink a lot of alcoholic beverages need Vitamin C, because the liver depends on it to produce an enzyme that helps take alcohol out of the bloodstream. Aspirin depletes the body of Vitamin C and blocks the blood cells from absorbing it. The more exposure to drugs and chemicals, the more Vitamin C is needed to minimize harmful effects.</P>
<P>   Diabetics seem to lack the ability to transport Vitamin C across their cell membranes, which can result in serious blood vessel complications, which is common among diabetics. Dr. George Mann of Vanderbilt University states that "cataracts may be a late consequence of marginal intakes of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), with the diabetic being more prone to cataracts because of their lack of insulin."</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COLLAGEN</H2>
<P>   Vitamin C is necessary for healthy metabolism of skin and connective tissues. Collagen is the major component of skin and connective tissues in our bodies and is the "glue" that holds our bodies together. It cannot be manufactured without Vitamin C. As long as our tissues have the strength provided by collagen, they are able to resist the invasion of infections. Defective collagen assumes a watery consistency and leaks into the bloodstream. The cells are then easily permeated, and all kinds of diseases can run rampant.</P>
<P>   Dr.  Constance  Leslie  of  Pindersfields  Hospital  in Wakefield, England and many other doctors believe that Vitamin C causes cholesterol to come out of arterial plaque into the blood.  It can then be used by the liver to make bile salts for digestion.</P>
 <P>  The brain has a greater concentration of Vitamin C than most other tissues in the body.  Dr. Pauling proved that insufficient Vitamin C can impair mentality.  There is strong evidence that ascorbic acid helps brain functioning.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CHELATION</H2>
<P>   Studies show that Vitamin C reduces the danger of mercury, cadmium and lead poisoning. With cars emitting at least 500 million pounds of lead into the atmosphere each year, it is estimated that over 200,000 American children are victims of chronic lead poisoning. It is difficult to avoid cadmium. You get it from passive cigarette smoke, white bread, coffee and tea, to name a few sources.  The FDA reported in Science Magazine that Vitamin C protects against cadmium toxicity.</P>
<P>   Vitamin C protects against nitrosamines, cancer causing chemicals that are made in the stomach from nitrates and nitrites in foods like hot dogs, bacon, luncheon meat and smoked fish.</P>
<P>   Thousands and thousands of papers have been published by reliable researchers from all over the world about Vitamin C. We cannot begin to list all the ways our bodies need Vitamin C, but these few things will give you an idea of its importance.</P>
<P>  Life Plus is careful to include a broad spectrum of bioflavonoids in VITA-C-1000-TR, as these substances occur with Vitamin C in nature.  Bioflavonoids are involved with every major metabolic process of the body, and they act synergistically with Vitamin C.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>   VITA-C-1000 is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit  of receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE VITA-C-1000</H2>
<P>   There is no generally accepted amount of Vitamin C to take as everyone has different needs. The RDA of only 60 mg is considered way too low and is only the amount necessary to prevent scurvy. However, larger amounts are needed in times of stress. Many experts believe that teenagers should probably take at least 2,000 mg per day, and most adults may do best on a minimum of 4,000 mg per day or more. Don't forget to include other Life Plus products you take that contain Vitamin C in computing your total consumption such as <A HREF="htvm.htm">TVM-49</A>, <A HREF="hcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A>, <A HREF="hsupt.htm">SUPPORT TABS</A>, <A HREF="hprotx.htm">PROTX II</A> and <A HREF="hcombat.htm">COMBAT</A>.

<H1>VITA-E-PLUS 400: Natural Water Soluble Vitamin E</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMPORTANT NUTRIENT </H2>

<P>   Next to Vitamin C, Vitamin E has probably received the most attention from researchers and is probably the next most important vitamin. Doctors Wilfred and Evan Shute were the first to show, years ago, that Vitamin E saved lives from myocardial infraction, which is the most common type of heart attack. They also gave Vitamin E to women who were pregnant to help them avoid complications. They found Vitamin E to be of great value in preventing miscarriages.</P>
<P>  The best food source of Vitamin E is whole grains, especially wheat. However, most individuals use white flour which has been stripped of all its Vitamin E. Vegetable oils are our next best source. However, most of the vegetable oils that are available commercially have been exposed to radiation, so free radicals have formed in them. This even increases our need for Vitamin E. In addition, the processing of the oils removes most of their Vitamin E, leaving an oil that gives no protection against the free radicals it easily forms.</P>
<P>   A National Institutes of Health study has revealed that the average dietary intake of Vitamin E is about 14 international units. They have also established an RDA of 30 units. It is easy to see from these figures that the average person receives less than half of the RDA for Vitamin E.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ANTIOXIDANT</H2>
<P>   Vitamin E is one of the best antioxidants known. One of its roles is to see that the oxygen in our bodies is not used on harmful or useless substances before it reaches the cells. Having adequate amounts of Vitamin E is more important today than ever before, because we are exposed to so many pollutants that interfere with healthy oxygen metabolism. Vitamin E is especially valuable for tissues that require lots of oxygen, such as the heart, brain and sex glands.</P>
<P>   Without adequate amounts of Vitamin E in the blood, our red blood cells break open and are destroyed. This condition is  referred  to  as  hemolytic  anemia  and  is  common  in newborn babies, especially those born prematurely. In the late 1960's astronauts on the Gemini mission developed this condition because their Vitamin E was quickly used up in the atmosphere they lived in. Since Vitamin E helps prevent anemia by protecting red blood cells from being destroyed by peroxides, it has been given to all astronauts since 1969 and this condition is no longer a problem.</P>
<P>  Breathing the air around some major cities can be hazardous to your health because of industrial and automotive pollution. The FDA has determined that a level as low as .05 parts per million of ozone is dangerous. They have shown that the toxicity of ozone is comparable to phosgene, a gas used in warfare. In Los Angeles, the ozone capital of the world, a typical concentration in the air is about 10 to 20 times the danger level.  Vitamin E blocks the damaging oxidation of healthy cells by ozone and is therefore a natural defense.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PREVENTION</H2>
<P>  Vitamin E helps to develop new veins between the existing ones. This helps the blood get from congested veins or varicose veins to more healthy ones. This is referred to as developing collateral circulation so the blood can circulate back to the heart.  Vitamin E can also help prevent intermittent claudication or lameness. Individuals with this condition can only walk short distances without developing severe leg cramps and pain.</P>
<P>  The estrogen related hormones in birth control pills neutralize Vitamin E and reduces its level in the blood stream.  Because Vitamin E naturally dissolves fibrin, the protein that organizes the formation of blood clots, women on "the pill" are known to be more prone to develop clots because Vitamin E levels are low. They should supplement with Vitamin E.</P>
<P>  Research has shown that reasonable levels of both Vitamin E and Selenium are necessary for either one of them to benefit our bodies. Unfortunately, the soils in certain areas of the U.S. are very deficient in selenium. Interestingly, the citizens of Rapid City, South Dakota have the highest blood levels of selenium and the lowest cancer rate in the U.S. On the other hand, Lima, Ohio has the highest rate of cancer and the lowest level of Selenium in the blood of its citizens. It is a good idea to make sure that your selenium levels are up to par as well. Selenium is included in <A HREF="htvm.htm">TVM-49</A>  and <A HREF="hcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A>. It is intentionally not included in VITA-E-PLUS 400 to guard against over supplementing with selenium.</P>
<P>  Most Vitamin E supplements are gelatin capsules containing oil.  Some of their Vitamin E is used up as an antioxidant protecting the oil. This is great for the oil, but it leaves less available for you. The natural d-alpha tocopherol succinate form of Vitamin E used in VITA-E-PLUS 400 is stable to oxidation, which ensures full potency. In addition, it is water soluble so it is more readily absorbed into the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>   VITA-E-PLUS 400 is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty   natural  concentrates  of  numerous   valuable phytonutrients from plants.   When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE VITA-E-PLUS 400</H2>
<P>  VITA-E-PLUS 400 is taken by those who want larger amounts of Vitamin E in their nutritional programs. Usually one or two tablets are taken per day, preferably after mid-day.</P>

<H1>VITA-SAURUS: Children's Chewable Multi-Vitamin</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> UNIQUE FORMULA </H2>

<P>  VITA-SAURUS is a naturally flavored, good tasting, chewable, multiple-type supplement for children of all ages. Older adults and individuals that have difficulty swallowing tablets can take it, too. A great deal of work and experience has gone into developing it.  It was developed  by  a  panel  including  pediatricians, biochemists and a pharmacist with years of experience in this field. They saw a need for a totally comprehensive multiple for children and VITA-SAURUS was designed and developed for that reason.</P>
<P>  We have challenged people to look in any drug store or health food store and try to find one that even comes close to VITA-SAURUS. None can be found. All other children's multiples contains Vitamins A, C, D and a small amount of B-Complex. For all practical purposes, most all other chewable products available are made in a base of regular table sugar and flavored with synthetic substances so they will taste like candy.  They are all loaded with different synthetic food coloring agents. (Studies have been done in several public school systems proving that the various food additives, including coloring agents, cause hyperkinetic children). These so called "nutritional products" usually gain their appeal by widespread intensive TV advertising, not because of their nutritional value.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NATURAL FLAVOR</H2>
<P>  VITA-SAURUS is flavored with a blend of natural extracts from citrus, pineapple, grape and cherry.  It is sweetened with fructose, a natural fruit sugar that does not stimulate the insulin response by the pancreas like regular table sugar. VITA-SAURUS does not contain any artificial coloring, flavoring agents or preservatives.</P>
<P>  Natural Beta-Carotene, which is totally safe even in large amounts, is used as the source of vitamin A. As in all  Life  Plus  products,  the  Vitamin  D  found  in VITA-SAURUS is natural Vitamin D-3 from fish liver oil. Also included are oil soluble Vitamins E and Vitamin K. Very few children's supplements contain Vitamin E and we know of none that contain Vitamin K.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MINERALS AND TRACE ELEMENTS</H2>
<P>  VITA-SAURUS is the only children's product that contains all of the trace minerals, Manganese, Copper, Zinc, Iodine, Selenium, Molybdenum, Chromium and Vanadium, in addition to the two standard important minerals, Calcium and Magnesium.</P>
<P>  Trace minerals are every bit as important in nutrition  as vitamins.  Chromium supports the pancreas in its production of insulin, which controls carbohydrate metabolism. Since children have a tendency to eat far too much sugar and other refined carbohydrates, Chromium is an important ingredient in any children's supplement.</P>
<P>  Selenium,  Molybdenum  and  Vanadium  are antioxidants that help fight the free radicals formed because of various pollutants, such as food preservatives in the diet and radiation from TV sets.   These free radicals can actually stimulate the formation of cancer. It is interesting to note that next to accidents, cancer is the leading cause of death today in children under the age of 19.</P>
<P>  In  addition  to  the  vitamins  and  minerals, VITA-SAURUS contains many additional associated nutrients.   The Citrus  Bioflavonoids,  Rutin and Hesperidin, that are synergistic with Vitamin C, are included.  VITA-SAURUS contains a full array of the B-Complex vitamins, plus Biotin and the valuable nutrients, PABA, Choline and Inositol.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IRON FREE</H2>
<P>  Iron is intentionally left out of VITA-SAURUS as the newest research shows that only slightly elevated amounts of it can cause the production of harmful free radicals in the body.</P>
 <P> VITA-SAURUS  is  the  most  rational  and comprehensive general nutritional product for children on the market today. There is nothing like it anywhere.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  VITA-SAURUS is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE VITA-SAURUS</H2>
<P>  It is recommended that one tablet be chewed twice a day, morning and evening, for children under 4 years of age. Children from 4 to 12 should take 2 tablets twice a day.   During periods of stress, such as colds, flu, infections, injuries, etc., double   the   dosage recommended. Older children and teenagers should begin taking <A HREF="htvm.htm">TVM-49</A> instead.</P>

<BR><BR><BR>
<H1>CALMAG PLUS: Calcium & Magnesium Ratio 1:1 </H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CALCIUM AND MAGNESIUM </H2>

<p>  We probably need more calcium and magnesium than any other vitamin or mineral because they are the primary building blocks of bones, teeth and muscles. Many foods contain these valuable minerals, especially calcium, so many people supplement their diets with calcium...yet calcium remains high on the list of minerals in which people are deficient.</P>
<P>  It is not how much calcium and magnesium you obtain from the foods you eat and supplements you take, but rather how much your body ABSORBS and UTILIZES. Very simply, calcium is difficult to absorb for most people.</P>
<P>  Life Plus understands that the name of the game is absorption and utilization; therefore, CALMAG PLUS is more than just a straight calcium supplement. It includes an abundant amount of magnesium and other specific nutrients your body needs in order to absorb and utilize both calcium and magnesium to its fullest potential. In taking CALMAG PLUS, you have a complete team working for you.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE CALMAG PLUS TEAM</H2>
<P>  Your body needs adequate amounts of magnesium in order to absorb calcium and it also needs adequate amounts of calcium to utilize magnesium. Vitamin D-3 is also included because it is necessary for both the absorption and utilization of calcium, and calcium is needed to utilize vitamin D-3. Any calcium supplement that does not contain calcium, magnesium and vitamin D is simply not of much value in terms of absorption and utilization in the body.</P>
<P>   Betaine HCI, glutaminic acid and the citrate form of calcium ensure that CALMAG PLUS is pH balanced. Proper pH (acid base balance) in the digestive tract is very important for proper calcium absorption.</P>
<P>   Alfalfa, Kelp and Dulce are also included as good sources of calcium and magnesium and all three are rich sources of trace minerals helpful for calcium and magnesium utilization. Boron is added to help maintain calcium levels in the body once it is absorbed. Studies have shown that less calcium is excreted in the urine if adequate levels of Boron are present.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TYPES OF CALCIUM & MAGNESIUM</H2>
<P>  Many calcium supplements contain only inexpensive, inorganic  forms  of  calcium,  such  as  oxides  or carbonates.  In general, most of these products are not worthwhile because most of the calcium is not absorbed. Different individuals seem to be able to absorb different forms of calcium and magnesium. This is why Life Plus CALMAG PLUS contains numerous sources of calcium and magnesium  including  citrates,  chelates,  aspartates, gluconates, ascorbates, glycerophosphates and lactates.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHY TAKE CALMAG PLUS?</H2>
<P>   Individuals who are allergic to dairy products (a major source of calcium in the American diet) can easily become deficient in calcium and need CALMAG PLUS to make up for the loss of this source of calcium.</P>
<P>  During pregnancy, mothers need a great deal of calcium and magnesium to ensure the proper development of the fetal bones, muscles and teeth and to ensure that the mother's own mineral stores are not depleted. For the same reason, lactating mothers should continue to supplement their diets with CALMAG PLUS.</P>
<P>   Growing children need extra calcium in their diets to ensure continuing development of muscles, bones and teeth. If they maintain proper levels of calcium, they will have less tendency toward cavities and broken bones.   CALMAG PLUS is the perfect supplement for them, but they may prefer the chewable Life Plus CANDY CAL tablet.</P>
<P>  Anyone who drinks large amounts of soft drinks need extra amounts of CALMAG PLUS, because of the leaching effects  of  the  ortho  phosphoric  acid. Carbonated, phosophorylated soft drinks are one cause of bone degeneration and the increased incidence of this problem has been shown to correspond to the increased consumption.</P>
<P>  Calcium and magnesium are absolutely necessary for healthy muscles.   Inadequate levels can lead to muscle cramping, especially in the legs.</P>
<P>   Elderly people find it increasingly difficult to absorb calcium and in general don't seem to get enough magnesium.    They often develop osteoporosis,  a condition  where  calcium  erodes  from  the  bones causing them to become weak and brittle. Elderly people should supplement their diets with Life Plus CALMAG PLUS.</P>
<P>  Calcium and magnesium are often called "Nature's Tranquilizers" because of their natural calmative effect, not only for muscles but for the nervous system as well.</P>

  <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  CALMAG PLUS is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty  natural  concentrates  of  numerous  valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit  of receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE CALMAG PLUS</H2>
<P>  It is usually recommended that most people take three CALMAG PLUS tablets two times per day, usually with meals.  This supplies 1,000 mg each of both calcium and magnesium and represents 100% of the RDA for calcium and 250% for magnesium. Individual needs will vary. Older individuals and pregnant or lactating women should consider taking more.</P>

<H1>CANDY CAL: Good Tasting Chewable Calcium Complex </H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CALCIUM </H2>

<P>  As far as sheer quantities are concerned, we probably need more calcium and magnesium than any other vitamin or mineral as they are the primary building blocks of bones, teeth and muscles. Many foods contain these valuable minerals, especially calcium.   Many people supplement their diets with calcium, yet calcium remains high on the list of minerals in which people are deficient.</P>
<P>  What really counts is not how much calcium and magnesium you obtain but rather how much your body ABSORBS and UTILIZES. Very simply, calcium is difficult to absorb for most people. Life Plus understands that the name of the game is absorption and utilization and therefore CANDY CAL is more than just a calcium supplement.  In addition, CANDY CAL contains the trace element Baron as it has been shown that adequate levels of Boron in our system reduces calcium excretion. Therefore, Boron helps ensure that calcium stores remain up to the levels needed once in the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TYPES OF CALCIUM & MAGNESIUM</H2>
<P> Many calcium supplements contain only inexpensive, inorganic forms of calcium, such as oxides or carbonates.  In general, most of these products are not worthwhile because most of the calcium is not absorbed. Furthermore, different individuals seem to be able to absorb different forms of calcium. This is why Life Plus CANDY CAL not only contains calcium carbonate for its antacid effect, but also provides additional calcium as PolyCalPlex, a Life Plus proprietary blend of high quality calcium sources including citrates, chelates, aspartates, gluconates, ascorbates, glycerophosphates and lactates.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHY TAKE CANDY CAL?</H2>
<P>   Individuals who are allergic to dairy products (a major source of calcium in the American diet) can become deficient in calcium and need to supplement with a reliable source of it.</P>
 <P> During pregnancy, mothers need a great deal of calcium  and  magnesium  to  ensure  the  proper development of the fetal bones, muscles and teeth and to ensure that the mother's own mineral stores are not depleted.  Lactating mothers should supplement with a reliable source of calcium.  Growing children need large adequate amounts of calcium in their diets to ensure continuing development of muscles, bones and teeth. If they maintain proper levels of calcium, they will have less tendency toward cavities or broken bones.  CANDY CAL  is  the  perfect  supplement for them, especially when used with <A HREF="hsaurus.htm">VITA-SAURUS</A>.</P>
<P>  Anyone who drinks large amounts of soft drinks need extra calcium  because  of the leaching effects of orthophosphoric acid in these drinks.   Carbonated, phosphorylated soft drinks are one cause of bone degeneration.  The increased incidence of this problem has been  shown to correspond to the increased consumption of soft drinks.  Elderly people find it increasingly difficult to absorb calcium and don't seem to  get  enough  magnesium. They  often  develop "osteoporosis," a condition where calcium erodes from the bones, causing them to become weak and brittle. </P>
<P>  Calcium and magnesium are absolutely necessary for healthy muscles. Inadequate levels can lead to muscle cramping, especially in the legs. They are often called "Nature's Tranquilizers" because of their natural calmative effect, not only for muscles but for the nervous system as well.</P>
 <P>  It is obvious that both calcium and magnesium are not only essential but very important nutrients. Life Plus is well aware of this and provides different calcium and magnesium supplements. <A HREF="hmag.htm">MAGNESIUM PLUS</A> and <A HREF="hhydro.htm">HYDRO MAG</A> are designed for taking larger amounts of magnesium when desired. <A HREF="hcalmag.htm"> CALMAG PLUS</A> provides a unique one-to-one ratio of both for balanced supplementation.  Both calcium and magnesium are bulky and difficult to get larger quantities in tablets. CANDY CAL is designed with three goals in mind; 1) provide a good source of extra calcium, 2) can be used as an antacid when needed, and 3) formulated in a pleasant tasting chewable tablet that is easy to use for both children and adults.</P>


<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  CANDY CAL is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus Phytozyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE CANDY CAL</H2>
<P>  CANDY CAL can be used by those wanting only calcium supplementation. Chewing four tablets during the day provides 120% of the RDA. You can adjust your intake as desired. It can be chewed as an antacid as well when needed.</P>

<H1>HYDRO MAG: Soluble Granular Form Multiple Source Magnesium</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMPORTANT NUTRIENT </H2>

<P>  Maintaining good levels of both calcium and magnesium is essential. They may be the most important nutrients required by man yet they are quite often deficient. In every muscle of our body, calcium and magnesium enjoy a reciprocal relationship.  Calcium stimulates the muscles to contract and magnesium helps them relax. When we are deficient in calcium, we can borrow from vast reserves in our bones, but when we get low in magnesium we obtain it from our muscles. As magnesium  disappears from the muscles, calcium rushes in and the muscles tend to become tense or cramp and we feel tired.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MULTIPLE SOURCES</H2>
<P>Different individuals  absorb different kinds of magnesium better than others. HYDRO MAG is formulated in such a way that it contains a unique combination of various, most highly bio-available forms of magnesium.</P>
<P>  Magnesium  deficiencies  result  in  excessive stress, high blood pressure, muscle cramps and spasms, fatigue, restlessness, irritability, depression, apathy, tremors, migraine headaches in pregnant women, asthma in young adults, severe tetanus and heart disease.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP</H2>
<P>  Many researchers believe a lack of magnesium may cause muscles of the arterial and venous walls to contract, causing high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes.</P>
<P>  A prominent researcher has found that magnesium helps to prevent migraine headaches in pregnant women. There is a tremendous demand for magnesium for the developing fetus. It has been estimated that these women only get 50 to 60 percent of the RDA of magnesium in their diets.  Research  has  also  shown  that  women experiencing PMS had lower levels of magnesium in their  red  blood  cells  and  concluded  that  many premenstrual symptoms may be caused by a magnesium deficiency.</P>
<P>We are inundated with large amounts of sodium in our diets.  It is a hidden "nutrient" in just about all processed foods, since many times we don't even know it is present. Even though we need a small amount of sodium, excesses are well known to contribute to atherosclerosis and high blood pressure.  Research in Scandinavia has recently been published that proves that the addition of magnesium to the diet can offset some of the damaging effects of sodium.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHY WE ARE DEFICIENT</H2>
<P>  Every step in the chain of modern chemical farming and food processing depletes our food of magnesium.  Chemical fertilizers used in agriculture today do not replace the lost magnesium. Unfortunately, nearly forty percent of the magnesium content of our foods leaches out when they are cooked</P>.
<P>  Some foods such as meat, ice cream and other "high fat" foods can cause a phenomenon known to scientists as "the magnesium trap."   These foods are low in magnesium themselves, but the primary problem is that they actually impair absorption of magnesium through the intestinal wall.</P>
<P>   Several medications such as certain diuretics used in the treatment of high blood pressure may cause the loss of magnesium from the body. Studies have shown that individuals with a low serum magnesium level required more anti-hypertensive drugs for the same degree of control of their blood pressure than those with normal magnesium levels. </P>
<P>  A French study found that magnesium deficiency results in calcium deposits building up in the blood vessels as well.   The researchers concluded that magnesium  deficiency  may  contribute  to  the accumulation  of fats  within  the  arterial  walls (atherosclerosis).   A leading researcher at Howard University has found that people who have had a heart attack have low blood levels of magnesium. Others have found that the heart muscle of those who have died from heart attacks have lower levels of magnesium in the heart than in other muscles in their bodies. Some foods high in magnesium include spinach, cabbage, tomatoes, bananas, and some fish such as salmon.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE HYDRO MAG</H2>
<P>  Dissolve contents of each 50 gm packet in 16 ounces of warm water and store in the refrigerator. The usual recommended amount is one or two tablespoonfuls per day.  One tablespoonful provides 100% of the RDA for magnesium. Some people seem to feel better when they take two or more.  Stir into three or four ounces of tomato or other vegetable juice. Most people prefer to take it at bedtime because they notice a natural relaxing effect.  Some individuals may notice loose stools when they take magnesium. If you do, simply stop taking it for two days and start back with one teaspoonful and build back up. It will usually go away when you adjust to it.</P>
<P>Both calcium and magnesium are very important. If you want to concentrate on calcium, you can take <A HREF="hcandy.htm">CANDY CAL</A>. If you want just magnesium. you can take <A HREF="hmag.htm">MAGNESIUM  PLUS Tablets </A> or HYDRO MAG Liquid.  If you want to take calcium and magnesium together, rely on <A HREF="hcalmag.htm">CALMAG PLUS</A>.

<H1>LIVER PLUS IRON: With Vitamin B-12, Vitamin C & Folic Acid</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HEMATINIC </H2>

<P>  LIVER PLUS IRON is a "hematinic." It is a tonic for the  blood.  Liver  has  long  been  known  as  a blood building food.  LIVER PLUS IRON is much more than just liver and iron. It is a special combination of carefully selected vitamins, minerals, herbs and concentrated tissue nutrients, which are all valuable in supporting the blood building process in the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT IS IRON POOR BLOOD?</H2>
<P>  Hemoglobin is the substance in red blood cells that carry the oxygen from the lungs to all the tissues of the body. Iron is used in the formation of hemoglobin, and so a deficiency of iron in the diet can retard the production of hemoglobin. This could result in the tissues receiving a reduced amount of oxygen from the lungs and a feeling of tiredness may develop. People who feel tired all the time and have low hemoglobin, can get very good results by taking LIVER PLUS IRON.</P>
<P>  There have been many products on the market over the years, composed mostly of iron, designed to help prevent anemia. Nearly everyone has seen the old TV commercials about "iron poor blood."  LIVER PLUS IRON is the ideal product for those who have a known condition  of anemia or a tendency  to develop anemia.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> LIFE PLUS ADVANTAGE</H2>
<P>  Various iron supplements on the market today contain different types of iron. Some are very difficult to digest, but they are often used as they can be manufactured at low cost. Furthermore, the wrong kind of iron, or even too   much   iron   supplementation,   may   cause constipation. Life Plus uses only a high quality chelated form of iron that is most easily absorbed and used by the body.</P>
<P>  Vitamin C ensures that the iron stays in its ferrous form so it can be used by the body. Therefore, Vitamin C is also included in LIVER PLUS IRON.</P>
<P>  Because the spleen produces red blood cells, it is valuable to the over all goal that a blood building supplement include support nutrients from bovine spleen tissue.   For this reason, Life Plus has also included Vitamin B-12 and Folic Acid, as they nutritionally support both the liver and the spleen and are important factors in the absorption of iron.</P>
<P>  LIVER PLUS IRON also contains concentrated tissue nutrients from liver and spleen for the nutritional support they contain. Liver, of course, has been recommended by doctors for years for its nutritional value. Concentrated tissue nutrients from bovine stomach and duodenum are included as well because of their synergistic nutritional effects and because they aid in the absorption of iron. All of these tissue nutrients have been concentrated by the freeze drying method to preserve their nutritional values.</P>
<P>  Unlike other hematinics, LIVER PLUS IRON also contains Marrow and three special herbal substances that are also known for their hematinic effect.  These are Spinach Leaf powder, Beet Root powder and Rhubarb Root.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  LIVER PLUS IRON is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE LIVER PLUS IRON</H2>
 <P>  Generally, one tablet twice a day at breakfast and the evening meal is recommended when needed. It is best to take LIVER PLUS IRON with meals.</P>

<TITLE>Be Healthy with Magnesium</TITLE>

<BR><BR><BR>
<H1>MAGNESIUM PLUS: Multiple Source Magnesium</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MULTIPLE SOURCES </H2>

<P>  Different  individuals  absorb  various  kinds  of magnesium better than others.  The great Life Plus formula MAGNESIUM PLUS is formulated in such a way that it contains a unique combination of  various most active bio-available forms of magnesium.</P>
<P>  Over the past twenty years, a great deal of scientific data has been gathered about the importance of magnesium. Magnesium deficiencies result in excessive stress, high blood pressure, muscle cramps and spasms, fatigue,  restlessness,  irritability,  depression,  apathy, tremors, migraine headaches in pregnant women, asthma in young adults, severe tetanus and heart disease.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP</H2>
<P>  Calcium and magnesium experience a reciprocal relationship in every muscle of our body, including both the smooth muscles of the heart as well as the skeletal muscles, which give us strength. Calcium stimulates the muscles to contract and magnesium allows them to relax. When our bodies are deficient in calcium, we can borrow from the vast reserves in our bones.  However, when the body gets low on magnesium, we must obtain it from our muscles, which can result in depletion.</P>
<P>  As magnesium disappears from the muscles, calcium rushes in. Then, the muscles exhibit a tendency to tighten up and become tense, which the doctors call hypertonic. Many researchers now believe that this lack of magnesium may cause the muscles of the arterial and venous walls to contract, causing high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes.</P>
<P>  A prominent  researcher  has  found  that magnesium helps to prevent migraine headaches in pregnant women.  There is a tremendous demand for magnesium by the developing fetus. It has been estimated that these women only get 50 to 60 percent of the RDA of magnesium in their diets. Research has also shown that women experiencing PMS had lower levels of magnesium in their red blood cells and concluded that many premenstrual  symptoms  may  be  caused  by  a magnesium deficiency.</P>
<P>  We are inundated with large amounts of sodium in our diets. It is a hidden "nutrient" in almost all processed foods and we often don't even know it is there. Even though we need a small amount of sodium, excesses are known to contribute to atherosclerosis and high blood pressure. Research in Scandinavia has recently been published that proves the addition of magnesium to the diet can offset some of the damaging effects of sodium.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHY ARE WE DEFICIENT?</H2>
<P>  Just about every step in the chain of modern chemical farming and food processing depletes our source of magnesium. Chemical fertilizers used in agriculture today do not replace the lost magnesium. Unfortunately, nearly forty percent of the magnesium content of our foods leaches out when cooked.</P>
<P>   Some foods such as meat, ice cream and other "high fat" foods can cause a phenomenon known to scientists as "the magnesium trap."  These foods are low in magnesium themselves, but the primary problem is that they actually impair absorption of magnesium through the intestinal wall.
  Several medications, such as diuretics used in the treatment of high blood pressure, may cause the loss of magnesium from the body.  Studies have shown that individuals with a low serum magnesium level require a greater amount of anti-hypertensive drugs for the same degree of control of their blood pressure than those with normal magnesium levels.</P>
<P>  A  French  study  found  that  a  magnesium deficiency results in calcium deposits building up in the blood  vessels  as  well.    They  concluded  that magnesium deficiency may therefore contribute to the accumulation  of  fats  within  the  arterial  walls (atherosclerosis).   A  leading  researcher at  Howard University has found that people who have had a heart attack have low blood levels of magnesium.  Others have found that the heart muscle of those who have died from heart attacks have lower levels of magnesium than other muscles in their bodies.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  MAGNESIUM PLUS is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE MAGNESIUM PLUS</H2>
<P>  The usual recommended amount is one to two tablets one to three times per day. Four tablets per day provide 100% of the RDA for magnesium. MAGNESIUM PLUS is for people of all ages and is usually best taken with meals.  However, anytime is acceptable.   Some individuals experience a feeling of relaxation when they supplement with magnesium. This can be a benefit them as they can take it before bedtime to help them sleep naturally.</P>
<P>   Magnesium can also cause loose stools in some people as it brings water into the digestive track. If you notice this effect, simply stop taking it for two days and start back with just one tablet and increase as you can. Taking it with meals can also help. Most people don't notice this effect so don't be unduly concerned.</P>

<H1>SYNERGY PAK: Foundational Nutritional Program</H1>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT </H2>

<P>The four Life Plus products contained in the SYNERGY PAK work together synergistically to help you start your nutritional support program. Many of us want to begin a nutritional program but we do not know how or where to begin.  SYNERGY PAK contains the four basic nutritional products to help get you started.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TVM-49</H2>
<P><A HREF="htvm.htm"> TVM-49</A> is one of Life Plus' most complete and comprehensive supplement ever formulated. It is an important component of the SYNERGY PAK as it contains all the vitamins, minerals, trace and ultra trace elements that have been classified as essential. The herbs and associated synergistic nutrients it contains helps ensure a broad spectrum nutritional base. TVM-49 contains at least 200% of the RDA's of all  vitamins  that  are  classified. TVM-49  is manufactured by strictly controlled cold processing methods and contains many "super foods" such as Lecithin, Bee Pollen, Kelp and bioflavonoids. These "super foods" contain many nutritional factors. It is presently formulated to not contain iron as recent research shows that even slightly elevated iron levels can stimulate the production of damaging free-radicals in the body leading to disease.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PROTX II</H2>
<P> The specialty formula contained in <A HREF="hprotx.htm">PROTX II</A> supplies the nutrients for protecting body cells and our immune system from free radicals.  Free radicals assault our cells ever minute of every day.  They contain a super reactive type of oxygen that is eager to damage DNA. We obtain these from the food we eat, the air we breath, cigarette smoke) to name only a few.  These Free radicals are generated by chemicals in our environment, our diets and are produced by various kinds of radiation, electrical and ultraviolet light. PROTX II supplies us with a wide spectrum of certain antioxidant nutrients such as Vitamin E, Vitamin C and Vitamin A (as Beta-Carotene) and actually present themselves to the free radicals. They then react with them so that the constituents of our cells are protected. PROTX II ensures the body is provided with a broad spectrum of antioxidant nutrients on a daily basis.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUSTENASE</H2>
<P> The unique method in which  <A HREF="hsust.htm">SUSTENASE</A> is manufactured provides a product that employs a two phase method that naturally assists the digestion of the foods we eat.  This two phase method assists the stomach (phase 1) and in the intestine (phase 2). It helps to ensure that we receive the nutrients contained in our foods. Proper digestion reduces stomach stress, relieves discomfort from overeating and aids in preventing symptoms of improper digestion, such as gas, bloating, burping and heartburn. In the stomach phase, SUSTENASE helps maintain acid pH by supplying Betain HCI which activates the protein digesting enzyme, Pepsin.  In its intestinal phase, it helps maintain a more alkaline pH.   Complete digestion of proteins is helpful in preventing food allergies. As a component of the SYNERGY PAK it is a basic product that everyone should have at every meal.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COLODYNE </H2>
<P>The  soluble  fibers  and  herbs  contained  in <A HREF="hcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> help cleanse the lower intestine, especially the colon.   They help ease conditions resulting from diets too low in fiber.  Most leading advisory panels recommend that our diets contain a minimum of thirty grams of fiber per day which is accomplished by one heaping teaspoonful of COLODYNE.  COLODYNE helps to naturally cleanse and correct chronic constipation. This great product contains beneficial bacteria that live in the digestive  tract  and  promotes  colon  hygiene, manufacture vitamins and helps maintain proper pi-I and control overgrowth of yeasts.  It also absorbs toxins that arise from incomplete digestion or contaminated foods.

<BR><BR><BR>
<H1>Q-PAK: Advanced Nutritional Program</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CARDIO-CHELEX </H2>

<P><A HREF="hcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A> is specially formulated to help the body nutritionally cleanse itself of many environmental pollutants. Good circulation is extremely important, because without it oxygen and nutrients could not reach our cells, and life would come to a screeching halt. Poor circulation puts stress on all organs of the body.   Several factors contribute to poor circulation such as diet, free radicals, pollution, certain drugs and chemicals, xanthan oxidase in homogenized milk, depressed immunity, a decreased ability of the blood to digest protein and anabolic disturbances in metabolism. When blood clots have a great chance of forming, heart attack, phlebitis, and stroke are more likely. CARDIO-CHELEX is the only product in existence that contains proteolytic enzymes and is catabolically balanced. Life Plus CARDIO-CHELEX contains 47 special nutrients that work synergistically for overall nutritional support.  CARDIO-CHELEX contains Carnitine and Mucoploysaccharides. Large amounts of Vitamin A and C are included, because they are natural anti-oxidants, immune stimulants and natural cleansing agents as well. Trypsin and Chymotrypsin are potent pancreatic enzymes that naturally keep the proteolytic activity of the blood up to proper levels. CARDIO-CHELEX is designed with prevention in mind. Common symptoms of poor circulation are cold hands and feet, tiredness, high and low blood pressure, difficult breathing and diminished vision. People living in areas that have high pollution levels should strongly consider CARDIO-CHELEX. Improved circulation can improve energy and alertness, increase stamina, and increase oxygen and nutrition to every organ of the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUPPORT TABS</H2>
<P><A HREF="hsupt.htm"> SUPPORT TABS </A> was originally formulated to support specific needs of alcoholics.  The core formula is based on research at Rutgers University. The research was undertaken to determine specific nutritional needs for organs in the body damaged by the stress of excessive alcohol consumption. That is, to help them maintain healthy metabolic processes and also rebuild. SUPPORT TABS is helpful in breaking habits such as drinking alcohol, overeating, smoking and using drugs. SUPPORT TABS fight the afternoon "blahs" that often develop as the stress of the day wears on. The amino acids and tissue nutrients support the organs normally fatigued the most by stress, especially the adrenal glands, which are the primary organs that tight stress, the liver and pancreas.  The amino acids, concentrated tissue nutrients, specific vitamins and minerals in SUPPORT TABS serve as fuel for the nervous system to provide energy, but also create a natural calming effect.  They help greatly to maintain more consistent blood sugar levels helping the body maintain energy and control the ups and downs associated with low blood sugar levels. Many people have great results with SUPPORT TABS helping them control excessive appetite and cravings.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PROANTHENOLS</H2>
<P> All <A HREF="hopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS BIO-COMPLEX<sup>TM</sup></A> products are formulated with 100% bioavailable and 100% residue free Proanthocyanidins (OPC's) from Masquelier's OPC-85 including pharmaceutical grade extracts of both grape seeds and pine bark. Other names for OPC's or proanthocyanidins or pycnogenols and leucocyanidins. The OPC's in PROANTHENOLS BIO-COMPLEX are manufactured and distributed under protection of U.S. Patent Number 4,698,360 assuring today's standard of excellence in OPC's. One important reason that Life Plus PROANTHENOLS BIO-COMPLEX stands out is the inclusion of CytoFlav-C, a secret blend of synergistic nutrients including Lemon Bioflavonoids, Hesperidin, Rutin, Quercetin and Vitamin C. They belong to the total family of bioflavonoids, occur in nature with OPC's and are a unique plus to these great formulas. The use of high quality patented extracts from both grape seeds and pine bark combined with the other unique synergistic nutrients in CytoFlav-C and the Life Plus PhytoZyme tablet base ensure the best OPC product available anywhere. In addition, it only makes sense to take advantage of the various individual catechins that occur in both grape seed and pine bark extracts. Each of them have their value and the Life Plus formula takes advantage of both.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2>MICRO-MINS</H2>
<P><A HREF="hmicro.htm">MICRO-MINS</A> provide the benefits of plant derived colloidal minerals. The value of minerals in the support of good health is becoming more realized by thousands of individuals. Everything on earth, even earth itself, is built on a foundation of minerals.  They are part of the structure of our connective and supportive tissues and are components of our hormones and enzymes, which are responsible for our biochemical life. It is amazing that it has taken so long to realize their important when U.S. Senate document number 264, published in 1936 stated, "Our physical well-being is more directly dependent upon the minerals we take into our systems than upon calories or vitamins, or upon the precise proportion of starch, protein or carbohydrates we consume." Trace minerals are only required in very small amounts, sometimes almost smaller than you can see with the naked eye. But this small quantity should not mean any less importance. A deficiency in any of them can be just as serious as any major mineral deficiency. Nowhere is there a more powerful of effective means of obtaining them than by taking Life Plus MICRO-MINS capsules.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COLODYNE </H2>
<P>The soluble fibers and herbs contained in <A HREF="hcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> help cleanse the lower intestine, especially the colon. They help ease conditions resulting from diets too low in fiber. Most leading advisory panels recommend that our diets contain a minimum of thirty grams of fiber per day which is accomplished by one heaping teaspoonful of COLODYNE. COLODYNE helps to naturally cleanse and correct chronic constipation. This great product contains beneficial bacteria that live in the digestive tract and promotes colon hygiene, manufacture vitamins and helps maintain proper pH and control overgrowth of yeasts. It also absorbs toxins that arise from incomplete digestion or contaminated foods.  Studies show that people with high fiber diets are less likely to develop arteriosclerosis and colon cancer.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUSTENASE</H2>
<P> This great product employs a two phase release method that naturally assists the digestion of the foods we eat. This two phase method assists the stomach (phase I)and in the intestine (phase 2).  It helps to ensure that we receive the nutrients contained in our foods.  Proper digestion reduces stomach stress,  relieves  discomfort  from  overeating  and  aids  in preventing symptoms of improper digestion, such as gas, bloating, burping and heartburn.   In the stomach phase, <A HREF="hsust.htm">SUSTENASE</A> helps maintain acid pH by supplying Betain HCI which activates the protein digesting enzyme, Pepsin. In its  intestinal  phase,  it  helps  maintain  a  more  alkaline  pH. Complete digestion of proteins is helpful in preventing food allergies. As a component of the SYNERGY PAK it is a basic product that everyone should have at every meal.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE Q-PAK</H2>
<P> Take one heaping teaspoonful of COLODYNE in juice in the morning, five CARDIO-CHELEX twice a day, in the morning and before lunch, two SUSTENASE and one PROTX II with meals and three SUPPORT TABS early and late afternoon.<P>

<BR><BR><BR>
<H1>PROANTHENOLS: Dr. Masquelier's 100% Bioavailable Proanthocyanidins</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HISTORY </H2>
<P>In 1928, Albert Szent-Gyorgyi isolated vitamin C from citrus and other sources. It helped prevent scurvy, but results were not consistent. He later isolated bioflavonoids, which he called vitamin P. He blended the two together and called the mixture "citrin."  This mixture was more reliable but still inconsistent.</P>
 <P>   Then in 1947, Professor Dr. Jack Masquelier, working at the University of Bordeaux began solving the puzzle.  The French government asked him to research the possible toxicity of the red pigment in peanut skins. The agricultural authorities wanted to know if the residue from peanuts being fed to livestock was toxic because some of the animals did not like to eat it.   He showed the red substance was not toxic and while studying it, isolated the first proanthocyanidins or OPC's ever identified. As a matter of fact, his Ph.D. thesis was about this research.  It shed light on the colorless OPC's that had a vascular protective effect greater than Szent-Gorgyi's citrin. The OPC's were different from the yellow colored bioflavonoids isolated earlier.</P>
<P>    In  1948 and in  1951, Masquelier registered his first patents. They described his method of extracting OPC's from peanut skins and pine bark.  In later patents, Masquelier described methods to obtain OPC's from grape seeds. Most importantly, his 1987 U.S. Patent No, 4,698,360 granted the exclusive right to use OPC's as antioxidants to protect the body "against the harmful biological effects of free radicals."</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TERMINOLOGY</H2>
<P>    Dr. Masquelier's extract contains individual units called catechins. The catechins, which occur individually, are called monomers. When they are linked together in pairs, they are called "dimers" and when in three's, "trimers." In 1979, he named the mixture "pycnogenols" from the Greek "pycno" meaning to "thicken or condense," "gen" meaning "to generate " and "ol" from their chemical name.</P>
<P>   The dimers and trimers are referred to as oligomeric proanthocyanidins.  "Oligo" is from the Greek meaning "a few" or "more than one but not many. " "Pro " means "before," "precursor" or "produces," and "anthoCyanins" are the red compounds that the proanthocyanidins change into when fruit ripens, flowers mature or leaves turn.</P>
<P>    "Oligomeric ProanthoCyanidins'' is abbreviated "OPC," They are found in most plants, are highly bioavailable and are active in the body as tremendous antioxidants and free radical scavengers. OPC's are chemically classified as flavanols and are present in red wines, flowers, leaves, fruits, berries, nuts, sorghum, beans and hops with high concentrations in skins, barks and seeds. The most feasible commercial source is the seeds of grapes and the bark of the French Maritime Pine.</P>
 <P>   Technically speaking according to Masquelier, OPC's are really not bioflavonoids.   OPC's are "flavonols" while bioflavonoids are "favonoids." While the chemical structure of their core molecules is the same, flavonols and flavonoids actually have more differences than similarities. OPC's are colorless, bioflavonoids are yellow. OPC's are water soluble, bioflavonoids are relatively insoluble.  Flavanols, including OPC's, are always made up of polymers of one compound called "flavan-3-ol", while bioflavonoids are made up of many different compounds with a "flavane" nucleus.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FORMULATION</H2>
 <P>  All  Life  Plus  PROANTHENOLS  products  are formulated exclusively with Dr, Masquelier's OPC-85, a scientific blend of extracts including grape seeds and French Maritime Pine Bark, under protection of U.S. Patent No. 4,698,360, assuring today's standard of excellence in proanthocyanidins. Up to 25% of OPC extract consists of monomeric precursors, the building blocks of OPC. In grape seed extract, these precursors are known as catechins and epicatechins. Pine bark extract contains catechins and taxifolin. Every plant species has its own unique precursor mix. Blending both grape seed and pine bark extracts combines all their monomeric precursors. The two together provide a broad spectrum, creating a more complete storehouse of OPC building blocks. On their own, these precursors are inactive and short lived. However, catalyzed by the presence of OPC, they become active and "unfurl" their own unique biological benefits rendering the blend richer in total activity.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> POWERFUL ANTIOXIDANTS</H2>
<P>    Free radicals are incredibly destructive. They damage our cells, which can mean premature aging, reduced immune function, inflammation and ultimately degenerative disease. Our primary defense is antioxidant nutrients, of which the most well known are vitamins C and E. The biological activity of antioxidants is enormously important to our health. OPC's, or proanthocyanidins are the most powerful antioxidant free radical scavengers known to man.  They are as much as 50 times more potent than vitamin F and 20 times more than vitamin C. OPC's are major protectors of collagen, the basic foundation our blood vessels and all connective tissues such as skin, ligaments around joints and tendons.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>   All  PROANTHENOLS products are formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme tablet base.  PhytoZyme base is a unique combination of concentrates containing numerous phytonutrients from over thirty different plants. When you take Life Plus products, you receive the added benefit of many natural  phytochemicals.    Each  formula  contains  these synergistic  nutrients  for  the  natural  health  supporting phytonutrients and other micronutrients they contain.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUGGESTED USE</H2>
<P>    Most individuals take 1 mg of OPC's per pound of body weight per day. For example, a 100 lb person would take 100 mg per day. This equals one HP 100 mg tablet or two Regular 50 mg tablets. Most take more the first week. Children and adults under 100 lbs take 100 mg per day. The HP formula is the most cost effective and convenient.  It is common to take more for specific needs.</P>

<H1>PROTX II: Antioxidant Protector Nutrients</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ANTIOXIDANTS </H2>

 <P>  Until recent years, the primary role of vitamins and minerals was considered to be as organic molecules essential for normal metabolism and maintenance of tissues, and for preventing the well know deficiency diseases such as scurvy beriberi, pellagra and others.</P>
<P>  We now know that many of the vitamins and minerals such as vitamins A, E and C in the form of    Beta-Carotene, Selenium, Germanium, Vanadium and others have additional other important functions as well. They work as antioxidants or free radical scavengers.</P>
<P>  Scientists have found that vitamins A, C and E prevent certain types of cancer by blocking the formation of cancer causing substances in the body. Researchers are using these vitamins to prevent nitrates from turning into nitrosamines, one of the most researched and most recognized cancer causing substances today. Nitrites and nitrates routinely are found in processed, packaged meats, in the water we drink and even in cigarette smoke. It is now known that second-hand cigarette smoke is even more dangerous than if you had been smoking.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BETA-CAROTENE</H2>
<P>   Vitamin A and its precursor, Beta-Carotene, which exists in carrots, spinach and other vegetables fight the cancer causing effects of cigarette smoke.  In several studies it has been demonstrated that people who smoke stand a lower risk of developing lung cancer if they have diets high in vitamin A (BetaCarotene) containing foods. Beta-Carotene is not only a valuable antioxidant, but like vitamins C and E, it is an important nutrient in maintaining the immune system.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VITAMIN C</H2>
<P>  Thousands of articles have been written about the beneficial effects of vitamin C on health, especially in regard to the immune system and its antioxidant effect. It has been proven that vitamin C protects against the harmful effects of cigarette smoke and environmental pollution  such as automobile exhaust, industrial chemicals, bacterial toxins and other free radical causing agents.</P>
<P>  Like Beta-Carotene, vitamin C is very capable of protecting against nitrosamines.  These substances are produced in the stomach from nitrates and nitrites in such foods as hot dogs, bacon, luncheon meat and smoked fish. Many rural wells contain nitrates that have entered underground water supplies from the run off` of fertilizers and herbicides that have been applied to our agricultural lands.</P>

<P>  Next to Beta-Carotene and vitamin C, vitamin E has probably received the most attention.  Doctors Wilfrid and Evan Shute first showed years ago that vitamin E saved lives.  Vitamin E is classified as an antioxidant which protects our bodies when they are exposed to environmental pollutants that interfere with healthy oxygen metabolism.  It helps "preserve oxygen." Vitamin E is also known to be of special importance to the heart and reproductive organs in our bodies as well.</P>
 <P>  Because of industrial and automotive pollution, major cities can be hazardous to your health.  The FDA has determined that the toxicity of the ozone is comparable to phosgene, used in gas war-fare, and that .05 parts per million of ozone is dangerous.  Vitamin E blocks the damaging oxidation of healthy cells by this ozone and is therefore a natural defense.</P>
<P>  You may ask why Life Plus has PROTX II as a product when vitamin C, vitamin E and Beta-Carotene are in other products. Quite simply, it can be important to take more of these valuable antioxidants than ever before, as the need for them is growing every day. PROTX II is a convenient, single source of these valuable nutrients and a simple way to ensure you receive reasonable amounts every day. PROTX II is part of the Life Plus answer to living in the 20th century.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  PROTX II is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty  natural  concentrates  of  numerous  valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE PROTX II</H2>
<P>   Most individuals take one tablet twice a day with their multiple vitamin and mineral. Usually, this is adequate. If  you  are  experiencing  unusual  environmental conditions or a stressful lifestyle, more tablets can be taken.</P>

<BR><BR><BR>
<H1>CO-Q-10: 50 mg of Co-Enzyme Q-10 Plus Quercetin & Lecithin  </H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CO-Q-10 PLUS
 </H2>

<P>  Co-Enzyme Q-10 is a nutrient necessary to the functioning of every cell in our bodies. Our bodies could not survive without it.  If body levels start dropping, so does our general health.
   Scientists estimate that once levels drop below the 25% deficient levels, many disease states begin to flourish including high blood pressure, heart attack, angina, immune depression, periodontal disease, lack of energy, weight gain and even early death.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CO-Q-10 AND ENERGY</H2>
<P>  Co-Enzyme Q-10 is known as CO-Q-10 and also ubiquinone.   It is a member of the quinone cyclic compounds that may be considered a relative of some potent anti-cancer drugs.  CO-Q-10 can add or remove oxygen from biologically active molecules.</P>
<P>  Every cell of the body contains many subcellular components called mitochondria, which produce 95% of the total energy of the body. CO-Q-10 is an integral part of the membranes of the mitochondria where it is involved in the production of ATP the basic energy producing molecule of cells.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND AGING</H2>
<P>  When immunity is low, so are the reserves of  CO-Q-10. When body levels of CO-Q-10 are raised, so is the immune potential. AIDS victims and other people with depressed immune systems can receive some help from antibiotic and anti-viral drugs, but they will not rebuild the immune system. Mice have been shown to have a 50% extended life span by supplementing with CO-Q-10.</P>
<P>   Co-Enzyme Q-10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells against free radical damage and exerting a protective effect on cell membranes. CO-Q-10 can naturally stimulate the immune system and result in a wide range of beneficial and protective effects.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE HEART AND BLOOD PRESSURE</H2>
<P>   Tissues that require the most energy (such as the heart) need the largest amounts of CO-Q-10.  Angina is a condition where inadequate oxygen is available to the heart muscle itself.  People with failing cardiac systems have shown to greatly benefit with increased strength and vigor when supplemented with CO-Q-10.  People with high blood pressure usually have lower levels of  CO-Q-10.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CO-Q-10 AND WEIGHT LOSS</H2>
<P>  It has been shown at the University of Texas and the University of Antwerp, Belgium that obese people can lose weight simply with the addition of CO-Q-10 to the diet. This research showed that obese people can have as much as a 50% deficiency of Co-Enzyme Q-10 in their tissues.</P>

<P>  People who eat a lot and yet stay slim have significantly higher levels of CO-Q-10 in their blood.  This wonderful enzyme can increase metabolic fuel efficiency within your cells - stimulating natural weight loss.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PERIODONTAL HEALTH</H2>
<P>  Co-Enzyme  Q-10  exerts  its  protective  and strengthening action in all tissues.  Working from the cellular level, it strengthens the gums as well as the heart muscle.  Many scientists believe that periodontal (gum) disease is a good indicator of low levels of CO-Q-10 in other tissues. The American Dental Association states that at least 87% of the American population has some sort of gum disease. This has been shown to be somewhat related to nutrition and particularly to levels of CO-Q-10, which has been shown to have a good protective effect for gum tissue.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE CO-Q-10 FAMILY</H2>
<P>   There are at least ten common CO-Q's, that is, different sized molecules from CO-Q-1 to CO-Q-10. The liver can utilize other CO-Q's to make CO-Q-10.  If the liver is not functioning efficiently, body levels can be too low, especially with advancing age or if disease is present. Our internal ability to produce CO-Q-10 declines with age, and as we get older, we must rely more on our diet.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IS CO-Q-10 SAFE?</H2>
<P>   In tests of thousands of people, no toxicity has ever been shown, no matter how high the amount. Plants and animals get it from the soil, but we get it from the plants and animals that contain various CO-Q's.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  CO-Q-10 PLUS is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE CO-Q-10 PLUS</H2>
<P>  There is no definite amount determined, but remember that more is needed as more energy is required. This is especially so if extra nutritional support is needed for the immune system, the heart, to lose weight or to protect against degenerative disease.  Life Plus CO-Q-10 PLUS tablets are packaged in bottles of 60. One to three tablets are recommended one to three times daily.</P>

<H1>LUNG FORMULA: Herbs & Other Nutrients for Your Lungs</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HERBALS </H2>

<P>   Herbs have been used since creation to provide for the health and well being of entire civilizations. The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage. Main stream modern technology is now finally beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies. This is usually referred to in the literature today as phytotherapy. We probably never will understand many of the secrets regarding how many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason to not take advantage of their benefits here and now.</P>
<P>  To the best of our knowledge, Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kind of herbal based products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific nutritional goals.   These other synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, antioxidants, and at times, concentrated tissue nutrients when appropriate.  By combining modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal based products are second to none anywhere in the world.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</H2>
<P>  Problems associated with the respiratory tract are among the most common health problems today. These maladies arise because of allergies, air pollution, smoking, infection, decreased immunity and poor nutrition, to name a few.</P>
<P>  Oxygen is the most important nutrient of all. The lungs pick up oxygen from the air we breath and expel carbon dioxide from the blood stream. Without adequate supplies of oxygen to the tissues, health simply cannot be maintained.  In our highly industrialized society, our lungs are exposed to much higher levels of pollutants than before. This excessive strain causes our lungs to become irritated, and they begin to malfunction or degenerate. When they do not function properly, lungs cannot absorb oxygen from the air efficiently to nourish our bodies.</P>
<P>  The major percentage of our population lives in large cities,  where  the  smog  and  air pollution  levels  are extremely high. If you live in Los Angeles, Denver, or Chicago, the pollution in the air you breath is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes per day. Keep in mind that even one puff of cigarette smoke supplies about one hundred billion anti-oxidant hits, and the first hit is on the cells of the lungs as air is inhaled. Tons of lead are put into our atmosphere every year from automobile exhaust. It is known that if you live within 500 feet of a busy highway, the lead levels in the air are more than 50 times higher than average.</P>
<P>  Anyone who has suffered from colds, cough, flu, bronchitis, asthma, or pneumonia knows what a blessing it is to have healthy lungs and proper breathing.</P>
<P>  Vitamin A deficiency can be one of the major reasons for lung deterioration. It is the most important nutrient that supports epithelia tissues including the lining of the lungs.  The Vitamin A in LUNG FORMULA is in the form of its natural plant source, Beta-Carotene. Life Plus LUNG FORMULA contains a representative amount to insure it is presented concurrently with the herbs in LUNG FORMULA. Larger amounts are intentionally not included to guard against obtaining too much Vitamin A from your overall nutritional supplement program.  More can easily be obtained by taking <A HREF="hcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A>, an ideal companion to LUNG FORMULA.</P>
<P>  LUNG FORMULA contains five natural herbs that have long been used because of their special nutritional values for the lungs. These herbs include Pleurisy Root, Slippery Elm, Fenugreek, Thyme and Yerba Santa. Smokers and individuals who live or work in large urban areas  should  consider  taking  Life  Plus  LUNG FORMULA.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  Life Plus LUNG FORMULA is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE LUNG FORMULA</H2>
<P>   It is usually recommended to take one or two tablets three times a day.   More can be taken if needed, especially in special times of need. For long term usage, it is recommended to take Life Plus LUNG FORMULA with additional sources of vitamin A, vitamin C, other antioxidants  and  enzymes.    This  can  best  be accomplished by taking <A HREF="hcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A>  , <A HREF="hprotx.htm">PROTX II</A> and <A HREF="hsoma.htm">SOMAZYME</A>.</P>

<H1>CARDIO-CHELEX: Naturally Chelating Preventive Nutrients</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HEART DISEASE </H2>


 <P>  Heart and circulatory disease is the number one killer in America today.  Heart disease and strokes kill over a million people each year -- more than accidents, cancer, diabetes, pneumonia and influenza combined!</P>

<P>   The circulatory system is one of the most critical systems  in  the body  for our overall  health  It supplies all the organs and tissues with nutrients and carries away the waste products of metabolism. The heart and brain need enormous amounts of oxygen to function properly. Senility and heart disease (as often seen in older people) usually comes as a primary result of decreased circulation.</P>
<P>   Atherosclerosis is a condition of plaque build-up in the medium  and  larger  sized  arteries.  Research indicates that there must be some form of injury to the lining  and/or  muscle  tissue  of  the  arteries  for atherosclerosis to even begin.   Because free radicals definitely cause irritation, inflammation and cellular destruction, it is believed that they can cause injury to the walls of the arteries allowing plaque to begin building up. Therefore, supplementing with substances that counteract free radicals only makes sense.</P>
<P>  The liver produces a protein called fibrinogen.  It circulates in the blood and when it comes in contact with damaged or diseased tissue, it is changed into fibrin protein and sticks to the damaged tissue to form a clot. When free radicals cause injury to the lining of arteries, the fibrin protein sticks to the injured wall and forms a sticky net which traps cholesterol type compounds, heavy metals and other substances.  As the lining heals, the proteolytic enzymes in the blood are then supposed to break down the fibrin.    Individuals  who  have  a  lower  activity  of proteolytic enzymes have a great chance of developing excess blood clots and atherosclerosis.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ANABOLIC AND CATABOLIC</H2>
<P>  CARDIO-CHELEX is the only product of its kind because it is catabolically balanced and contains proteolytic enzymes, plus natural chelating vitamins and amino acids. Recent innovative research shows that all metabolism (the chemical reactions in the body) fall into one of two categories:  (1) anabolic, or  building-up processes, and; (2) catabolic, or tearing down processes. The formation of a blood clot is an example of an anabolic process because it "builds" the clot. In time, the clot must be "broken down" (a catabolic process) by the proteolytic enzymes. If the body is too anabolic, the clots and plaque will remain and begin to accumulate.</P>
<P>   It has  been  shown that both  atherosclerosis  and hypertension are correlated with too much anabolic activity  which  builds  up  plaque  in  the  arteries. CARDIO-CHELEX contains many special nutrients that support catabolic activity. For this reason, several anabolic nutrients are intentionally not included  in CARDIO-CHELEX. CARDIO-CHELEX is not designed as a multiple vitamin like <A HREF="htvm.htm">TVM-49</A>.   It is formulated with specific nutrients for specific effect. However, when taken in the morning and with Support Tabs  in the afternoon, you receive the value of a multiple type supplement as well as the advantage of the separate formulas.</P>
<P>   Prolonged stress causes the body to produce excess fatty acids and remain too catabolic. The body then reacts by producing excessive anabolic sterols like cholesterol, which can become trapped in the sticky fibrin on the cell walls.  One important reason exercise is so important in preventing cardiovascular disease is because it burns the excess fatty acids produced in reaction to stress, thus less anabolic sterols are produced in the body.  The special catabolically balanced nutrients in CARDIO-CHELEX, combined with a reasonable amount of exercise, is a winning combination in the prevention of heart disease.</P>
<P>  CARDIO-CHELEX contains over 47 special nutrients that work synergistically for the overall nutritional support of the circulatory and immune systems. They can be classified as (1) catabolic sulfur-containing amino acids, (2) proteolytic enzymes, (3) concentrated tissue nutrients, (4) vitamins, (5) minerals, (6) herbs, (7) natural chelating nutrients, (8) anti-oxidants, (9) free radical scavengers, and (10) immune stimulants.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  CARDIO-CHELEX is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE CARDIO-CHELEX</H2>
<P>   If you are under 40 and in relatively good health, five tablets once a day, first thing in the morning, is recommended. If you are over 40, or your family has a history of heart problems, or you have a special need, take 5 tablets twice a day, first thing in the morning and mid-day. Some individuals may notice an "uncomfortable feeling" at first when they begin taking CARDIO-CHELEX as it begins pulling pollutants and toxins out of the body. If this happens to you, wait two days and start again with one tablet daily for two days and then increase by one tablet every two or three days. Five tablets in the morning plus five tablets around mid-day is the ideal amount.  Certain nutrients are intentionally deleted for specific effect. Combined with <A HREF="hsupt.htm"> SUPPORT TABS</A> as in the <A HREF="hqpak.htm> Life Plus QPAK</A> , you get the best of both worlds.  That is, you get the advantages of the specific effects of both products plus all the value of a multiple as well.</P>

<H1>SOMAZYME: Active Enzymes for the Whole Body</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENZYME REACTIONS </H2>

<P>   There are thousands of different enzymes in our foods and in every cell of our bodies. Enzymes are needed to either initiate, accelerate or separate the distinct chemical reactions in the body. Without enzymes, most of the chemical reactions that make up our overall metabolism would never take place, let alone proceed efficiently in a healthy manner.  They are involved in anabolic reactions in the body that manufacture or "build up" substances. The end products can be other enzymes or hormones that the body uses to complete certain functions. Enzymes are also involved in our catabolic or "breaking down" reactions. All of these are natural processes and enzyme levels are critical to them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WE NEED ENZYMES</H2>
<P>   A quality diet containing a reasonable amount and variety of fresh, raw fruit and vegetables would supply our bodies with the enzymes it needs. However, most individuals do not eat this way and most enzymes are quickly destroyed when heated or cooked above 106"E  Since almost everyone exists on mostly cooked foods today, or to a great extent on processed foods, it would be wise to consider supplementing diets with SOMAZYME. Even our fresh raw foods of today cannot support us with the enzyme nutrition we need, because they are frown in mineral depleted soils and thus don't have the enzyme content of food grown early in this century.</P>
<P>  Our continued exposure to many enzyme inhibitors contributes to decreased enzyme activity in the body. The average person is exposed to many enzyme inhibitors daily such as fluoride and chlorine in public water supplies, copper from plumbing, etc. Even soybeans and certain other legume's contain anti-trypsin factors, which interfere with the pancreatic enzyme, Trypsin.</P>
<P>  These factors  may create a big  need for enzyme supplementation in the diet for some individuals. SOMAZYME provides a wide variety of the enzymes that support thousands of biochemical reactions involved in good health.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENZYME SOURCES</H2>
<P>  For maximum effect, the enzymes in SOMAZYME are obtained from both plant and animal sources. Pancreatin, Trypsin, Alpha-Chymotrypsin, Lysozyme and Super Oxide Dismutase are obtained from animal sources. They are present naturally in our bodies. Papayotin is obtained from papaya and Bromelain from pineapple. All of these enzymes are well known for their ability to breakdown proteins. Pancreatin also breakdown lipids (fat) as well. Even though the pancreas produces most of these enzymes, at times it may be stressed or unable to produce the quantities that may be needed for controlling many unwanted processes in the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FIBRIN PROTEIN</H2>
<P>   The single most important activity of these "proteolytic" enzymes (enzymes which break down proteins) is probably the natural role they play in the blood clotting mechanism. The liver produces a protein called "fibrinogen" and secretes it into the bloodstream.  When fibrinogen contacts damaged tissue, it is changed into a unique protein called "fibrin:' a large, sticky, insoluble protein molecule. When tissue is damaged, the fibrin molecules rush to the scene and begin the formation of a clot to prevent bleeding.  Soon after clots are formed, the proteolytic enzymes in the blood stream begin to break them down, so the tissue will not be damaged from extended lack of oxygen and nutrition due to impaired circulation over a period of time.</P>
<P>   Many of the enzymes in SOMAZYME, and in the diet as well, are produced in the body and break down this fibrin naturally. Excess fibrin proteins not broken down by proteolytic enzymes are a major component of plaque in the arteries. It is actually the main ingredient that lays down the foundation for the plaque and is the glue that holds it together.  In addition, cholesterol, fats, calcium compounds, heavy metals and other ingredients make up other parts of it. Plaque in the arteries leads to arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). With an adequate supply of proteolytic enzymes in the blood stream available to break down these fibrin proteins, there is less chance of plaque buildup.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> LYSOZYME</H2>
<P>   Lysozyme is an enzyme that is a component of every lung cell in our bodies.  It is in abundant supply in the fluids that are secreted from the eyes, nasal and sinus membranes, vagina, etc. It is a component of saliva and breast milk.  It is a very important substance in the control of infections as it enzymatically attacks invading bacterial and viruses. Large amounts of sugar in the diet can cause Lysozyme levels to decrease. Studies have shown that taking antibiotics can cause the lysozyme levels to decrease dramatically in the saliva of infants. The Lysozyme in SOMAZYME is formulated as Cytovex, which is a proprietary Life Plus enzyme base that ensures stability and consistency.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CO-FACTORS</H2>
<P>   Reliable sources of the minerals Magnesium, Manganese and Zinc are included in the SOMAZYME formula because they act as a co-enzyme in many enzyme-controlled chemical reactions in the body and assist enzyme activity. The valuable bioflavonoids, Rutin, Hesperidin  and Lemon Bioflavonoids are included for their nutritional value in maintaining the integrity of the circulatory system.  Certain amino acids and glutathione help ensure ideal enzyme activity. Buffering agents help protect the enzymes from stomach acids and because enzymes are extremely heat sensitive, all the ingredients are prepared by the cold processing method to preserve activity.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  SOMAZYME is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit  of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE SOMAZYME </H2>
<P>From one to five tablets are taken once, twice or three times per day, preferably on an empty stomach, away from meals as a systemic enzyme supplement for the whole body. Quite often, larger amounts are taken, particularly in short periods of need.
   SOMAZYME is a high quality enzyme supplement intended to be used by those who wish to increase their daily intake of proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes.</P>

<BR><BR><BR>
<H1>ENDOCRYN DHEA: Real DHEA Prohormone Complex </H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MOTHER OF HORMONES </H2>

<P>   DHEA is called the mother of hormones by researchers because it is used by the body to manufacture many other hormones, including our sex hormones that are necessary for many bodily functions. Some of these are well known, such as estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, cortisone and others. They are responsible for the maintenance of many bodily functions such as fat and mineral metabolism, controlling stress, maintaining male and female characteristics and others. The body produces DHEA and then converts it on demand to these other hormones. In addition, we now know that each of our cells also have DHEA receptors, meaning that DHEA has its own effects as well.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGING</H2>
<P>   This wonderful substance is abundant in our bodies when we are about 20 years old but continues to decrease with time. At 80 years of age, we usually only produce about 10 to 20% of the amounts when we were in our 20's. Interestingly, the steady declining levels of DHEA in our blood stream as we age perfectly matches the increasing incidence of the killer diseases cancer, heart disease (including atherosclerosis) and Alzheimer's disease.</P>
<P>  Much research has shown the major importance of DHEA levels in the prevention of these kinds of disease.   For example, a 1988 study at Johns Hopkins showed 50% reduction in arterial plaque in rabbits. A Temple University study showed supplemental DHEA was able to prevent breast cancer in mice that were prone to develop it. The studies also showed the prevention of lung and bowel tumors plus the extension of life span. A study in Guernsey, U.K. showed women destined to develop breast cancer had low DHEA levels up to nine years previous.  Doctors at the Medical College of Virginia showed lower DHEA levels were associated with build-up of atherosclerotic plaque and that higher  insulin  levels  from  the  ingestion  of  simple carbohydrates caused a reduction of DHEA levels in the body. Maintaining DHEA levels in the body has been shown to be important in improving memory, preventing Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis in post-menopausal women.</P>
<P>   A twelve year study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1986 (315.1519-24) reported that of the 242 men aged 50-79 studied: "A I00 microgram per deciliter increase in DHEA sulfate concentration corresponded with a 48% reduction in mortality due to cardiovascular disease and a 36% reduction in mortality for any reason. The natural level of DHEA sulfate was measured and those individuals with higher DHEA sulfate levels lived longer and had much lower risk of heart disease."</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WEIGHT CONTROL</H2>
<P>   One of the most exciting benefits of DHEA is its ability to burn fat and help keep it off by converting fat to muscle. It is a "thermogenic" substance because it helps burn calories for energy rather than store them as fat.</P>

<P>   Dr. A. Schwartz, a researcher at Temple University, has now proven beyond question DHEA's effectiveness in weight control.  DHEA's ability to block an enzyme named G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase) may be one of the most significant finds of the century.  This enzyme is not only essential for fat tissue production but also promotes cancer cell growth. By blocking it, DHEA's action of reducing body fat and helping to prevent against cancer may be explained. DHEA's weight control effect does not seem to be so diet dependent. No matter what you eat, DHEA still has benefits of weight loss. Of course, dietary modification, exercise and lifestyle are important in weight control but it is exciting to obtain benefits of such a fantastic natural substance at whatever level of commitment you want to make.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> UNIQUE FORMULATION</H2>
<P>   DHEA has probably become the most extensively studied substance in recent history. This is because it plays such an important role in metabolism and can have such an amazing positive effect when used as a specialized supplement. DHEA is a much needed substance to maintain youthful vigor, a lean body and many other desirable traits.  Our endocrine (hormonal) system is virtually dependent on adequate levels of DHEA, but unfortunately levels decrease as we age. Many researchers believe that decreasing levels of DHEA contribute to symptoms normally associated with aging as well as many degenerative conditions such as cancer and atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries.</P>

<P> ENDOCRYN DHEA not only contains a full 30 mg of the prohormone DHEA, but also 10 mg of a high quality Phytosterol Complex that also serves as fuel for the endocrine system. The herbal concentrates, amino acids, pantothenic acid and magnesium nutritionally support adrenal function for optimum health.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  ENDOCRYN DHEA is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE IT</H2>
<P>  As a natural DHEA supplement for general use, it is usually recommended to take one tablet from one to three times a day.  Larger individuals, or those desiring a more aggressive approach, may take more for a month or two. The goal is to provide your body with the DHEA and nutritional materials to support your adrenal glands so they can produce and maintain healthy DHEA levels.</P>

<H1>SHAPE PLUS: Herbal Appetite Suppressant with Chromium Picolinate</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BEAUTIFUL IMAGE </H2>

<P>  SHAPE PLUS can help you achieve the "beautiful image" you have always desired. Combined with other Life Plus products, a sensible diet and a reasonable amount of exercise, SHAPE PLUS is helping thousands lose weight. Most importantly, they are keeping it off. It was developed by a biochemist who is well known for his understanding of lipid (fat) metabolism.  After much testing,  Life  Plus  decided  this  effective  herbal combination would make an exciting product to serve as an adjunct for individuals wanting to take a rational approach to weight management, not just a quick artificial, fad program.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW IT WORKS</H2>
<P>  SHAPE PLUS contains twenty-three different herbs and herbal extracts that contain higher levels of polyphenolic compounds.  It also contains 200 mcg of Chromium in the form of Chromium Picolinate. The polyphenols in these herbs are tannin related compounds and are somewhat astringent.  They have a natural appetite suppression action and help to reduce hunger if taken soon enough before hunger begins.</P>
<P>  These polyphenols are now becoming more well known in the literature and are generally considered to be some of the phytochemicals responsible for many health processes in the body.   They have a natural cleansing effect on the whole body and help the body detoxify as it is cleansed during weight loss.</P>
 <P> The herbs in SHAPE PLUS can reduce the amount of dietary fat absorbed into our bodies, thereby reducing calorie uptake from fat. They tie up fats naturally in the digestive tract making them less susceptible to digestion. The net result is that they are eliminated rather than absorbed.  They also help move food through the digestive tract at a more rapid pace, so that the extra "empty calories" do not linger and become absorbed.</P>
<P>  When fewer calories are absorbed, the body uses up its own fat for energy.   The natural appetite control provided by SHAPE PLUS is a blessing to those trying to control their eating habits.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CHROMIUM PICOLINATE</H2>
<P>  The Chromium Picolinate in SHAPE PLUS reduces the craving for sweets and helps the body maintain proper blood sugar levels. The typical energy ups and downs normally associated with dieting are greatly reduced. Not only individuals attempting to lose weight, but body builders and weight lifters take Chromium Picolinate as it supports the conversion of fat to lean body tissue. By having a greater percentage of lean body tissue to fat tissue, your metabolic consumption of calories is higher and it is easier to "burn more calories" every minute of every day. This, of course, makes it easier to keep those excess pounds off forever.</P>
<P>  The most well liked feature of  SHAPE PLUS is that it naturally reduces appetite. SHAPE PLUS can be taken anytime during the day. However, it must be taken at mealtime or when food is eaten to obtain its full benefit. People routinely loose five or more pounds per month.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PROGRAMS</H2>
<P>  SHAPE PLUS can be used by itself or as part of any weight program.  When used as part of a total weight management, the best results are obtained. Always limit fats, processed foods and refined carbohydrates.   Use common sense when eating, and it will be easier to avoid unwanted calories while taking SHAPE PLUS.</P>
<P>  The ideal weight management program is to eat sensibly and take SHAPE PLUS with four other synergistic   Life   Plus   products, <A HREF="hendo.htm">  ENDOCRYN DHEA</A>, <A HREF="hsupt.htm">SUPPORT TABS</A>, <A HREF="hpromax.htm">PRO-MAX</A> and <A HREF="hcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A>. Take one heaping teaspoonful of COLODYNE in juice each morning, one or two ENDOCRYN DHEA tablets three times a day with meals, three SUPPORT TABS twice a day, and replace one or two meals a day with a PRO-MAX shake. Only eat fruits and vegetables between meals.

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  SHAPE PLUS is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them. </P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE SHAPE PLUS</H2>
<P>  It is best to take SHAPE PLUS between 15 and 30 minutes before each meal. If you get hungry, take it. Between two and four tablets are usually taken before meals and one with light snacks. Be consistent and take SHAPE PLUS every time you eat. Carry some tablets with you at all times, so that you have them whenever you decide to snack or "eat out".</P>

<H1>PROMAX: Low Calorie Meal Replacement</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PROTEIN ASSURANCE </H2>

<P>  PRO-MAX is a highly nutritious supplement that provides the daily requirements of protein for lasting energy while at the same time supplying complex carbohydrates for more immediate energy.  Because of the combination of both high quality protein and high quality complex carbohydrate, PRO-MAX is particularly suitable for use by athletes and those with high energy expenditure requirements.  PRO-MAX, especially when taken with <A HREF="htvm.htm">TMV-49</A>, is also suitable as a meal replacement for individuals on calorie restricted diets. It is  ideal  for  adding  to  milk, juices  or  other  foods, fortifying them with protein and complex carbohydrate. At the same time, it is relatively fat free and ensures adequate levels of high quality protein while minimizing fat intake. Because PRO-MAX is so easily digested, it is also excellent for fulfilling the nutrition requirements of both children and elderly individuals who have a tendency to not eat as they should.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SOY & DAIRY FREE</H2>
<P>  PRO-MAX is an unusual blend of natural plant source protein and complex carbohydrate that is both dairy and soy free.  The high quality protein in PRO-MAX is obtained from natural Legume concentrates (Pisum Sativum) vegetable sources.  It can be used freely by those individuals who have dairy and/or soy allergies. Plus, it is much better tasting than soy-based products.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PRO-MAX IS SPECIAL</H2>
<P>  Life Plus developed PRO-MAX to represent the state-of-the-art in protein supplements. We chose not to use any soy, milk or hydrolyzed protein. We were able to identify an excellent source of high quality vegetable protein, extracted for us from certain yellow peas under carefully controlled and monitored conditions.   It contains a high percentage of essential amino acids.</P>
 <P>  All proteins are not created equal. Different proteins contain various amounts of essential amino acids. Essential amino acids are those that the body cannot manufacture itself so they must be contained in the diet. PRO-MAX, with its high percentage of essential amino acids, is a leading product in its category. The P.E.R. or Protein Efficiency Ratio is a number that describes the quality of proteins. PRO-MAX has a very high P.E.R. of 2.7. Actually, PRO-MAX can supply the body's entire need for protein if enough were taken.</P>
<P>  PRO-MAX also contains complex carbohydrates, those  that  scientists  refer  to  asamylaceous polysaccharides, from specially grown barley processed in such a way as to protect its other beneficial natural ingredients.  The inclusion of thirty percent complex carbohydrate in this great product is consistent with current research. This research demonstrates that excess protein on its own may have adverse effects, especially in the case of persons who have any tendency towards hypoglycemia.  The benefits of protein/carbohydrate combinations are becoming well established.   In addition, PRO-MAX contains good, soluble dietary fiber and provides substantial quantities of natural vitamins and minerals from the specially grown barley.</P>
<P>  PRO-MAX is pleasantly palatable. It has a pleasant, somewhat bland taste which is superior to other protein powders. Therefore, PRO-MAX is the finest and most versatile protein supplement in both palatability and composition. It is useful for fast energy and for building up energy reserves for people of all ages.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  PRO-MAX is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty  natural  concentrates  of numerous  valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE PRO-MAX</H2>
 <P> PRO-MAX is intended to be used in the form of a drink, although it can be used as an ingredient, which can be added to flour, baked goods and other cooked products. It can also be added to prepared foods such as dips, soups, sauces and gravies. For those wishing to gain weight we recommend that it be taken in the form of a shake at meal times in addition to your regular food. In the  case  of  athletes,  take  in  water  or juice approximately one hour before exercise.  As a meal replacement, use two or three heaping tablespoonfuls in skim milk or your favorite juice in place of the meal.</P>

<H1>PROMAX 100: 100% Pure Vegetable Protein</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PROTEIN ASSURANCE </H2>

<P> PRO-MAX 100 is a highly nutritious supplement intended to provide the daily requirements for protein. Because of its high quality protein, it is particularly suitable for use by athletes and others with high protein requirements.  It is also suitable as a meal replacement  for individuals on calorie restricted diets, although <A HREF="hpromax.htm">PRO-MAX</A> is usually used for this purpose. On the other hand, PRO-MAX 100 is usually preferred as the supplement of choice for fortifying foods and drinks by persons who want to ensure they are getting plenty of protein in their diet. It is great to use for low fat diets as well because PRO-MAX 100 is virtually fat free and easily digested.  Both of these products are excellent for fulfilling the nutrition requirements of children and for the elderly as it is easily digested.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PRO-MAX 100 IS SPECIAL</H2>
<P> Life Plus developed <A HREF="hpromax.htm>PRO-MAX </A>and PRO-MAX 100 to represent state-of-the-art in protein supplements. We chose not to use any soy, milk or hydrolyzed protein.  We were able to identify an excellent source of high quality vegetable protein, extracted for us from certain yellow peas under carefully controlled and monitored conditions. It contains a high percentage of essential amino acids.</P>
<P>  All proteins are not created equal. Different proteins contain various amounts of essential amino acids. Essential Amino Acids are those that the body cannot manufacture itself, so they must be contained in the diet. PRO-MAX 100, with its high percentage of essential amino acids, is a leading product in its category. The P.E.R or Protein Efficiency Ratio is a number that describes the quality of proteins. PRO-MAX 100 has a very high P.E.R. of 2.7. PRO-MAX 100 could supply the body's entire need for protein if enough were taken.</P>
<P>  PRO-MAX 100 is very palatable. It has a pleasant, somewhat bland flavor superior to other protein powders. <A HREF="hpromax.htm">PRO- MAX</A> and PRO-MAX 100 are the two finest and most versatile protein supplements in both palatability and composition.    They are useful for lasting energy and for building energy reserves for people of all ages.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?</H2>
<P> The only difference between <A HREF="hpromax.htm">PRO-MAX</A> and PRO-MAX 100 is that PRO-MAX 100 does not contain the complex carbohydrates and fiber that are present in <A HREF="hpromax.htm">PRO-MAX</A>. PRO-MAX 100 contains 100% protein whereas <A HREF="hpromax.htm">PRO-MAX </A> contains 70% protein and 30% complex carbohydrate. Any given amount of PRO-MAX 100 contains 1.43 times the amount of protein than <A HREF="hpromax.htm">PRO-MAX</A>. PRO-MAX 100 is for those individuals who, for one reason or another, wish to obtain their carbohydrate from other sources. While <A HREF="hpromax.htm">PRO-MAX </A> is more nutritionally complete, carbohydrate-sensitive individuals may prefer PRO-MAX 100.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  PRO-MAX  100  is  formulated  in  the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phyto nutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE PRO-MAX 100</H2>
</P>  PRO-MAX 100 is intended to be used in the form of a drink and as an ingredient added to recipes. It can be added to flour used in baked goods such as breads and cookies.  It can also be added to dips, soups, sauces and gravies. For those wishing to gain weight, we recommend that it be taken in the form of a shake at meal times in addition to your regular food. In the case of athletes, take in water or juice approximately one hour before exercise. Many people claim both <A HREF="hpromax.htm">PRO-MAX </A> and PRO-MAX 100 are great to control appetite and help maintain energy levels throughout the whole day.</P>

<BR><BR><BR>

<H1>SUPPORT TABS: Natural Stress Formula Par Excellence</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SPECIFIC SUPPORT </H2>

<P>  SUPPORT TABS is one of the leading Life Plus products.  The original research this great formula is based on was completed at Rutgers University. The goal was to understand specific support needed by alcoholics because of the damage done to specific organs in their bodies by the excessive use of alcohol.</P>
<P>   Alcoholics are all hypoglycemic, a condition that is characterized by wide and varied blood sugar levels. Millions of Americans are affected by this condition to some degree. Our blood sugar levels fluctuate normally within a limited range, but problems can develop if those levels change too rapidly or if they get too high or too low.  When they are too high for extended periods of time, diabetes is the result. If the levels become too low, a condition known as hypoglycemia can cause problems.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS</H2>
<P>  Carbohydrates   stimulate   the   pancreas   to produce insulin. Insulin transfers sugar out of the blood into the cells, where it is used for energy. The chronic eating of too much refined carbohydrate such as sugar over-sensitizes the pancreas and after a time it begins to over react to sugar in the diet.  The pancreas then produces too much insulin and blood sugar levels fall too low.   People then get the "blahs" and eat more sugar-containing foods to overcome the slump.  The pancreas over reacts again with too much insulin and the "blahs" strike again.   This condition is called hypoglycemia.</P>
<P>  The  cycle  continues  until  eventually  the pancreas  becomes  exhausted  and  can  hardly produce any insulin at all. This condition then becomes diabetes.</P>
<P>  The adrenal glands also stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin. Caffeine and nicotine stress out and exhaust the adrenals in a similar way. This aggravates hypoglycemia just like eating too much sugar.</P>
<P>  SUPPORT TABS nutritionally support the pancreas, pituitary, liver, adrenals, hypothalamus and the whole body as well. The hypothalamus has long been known to be involved in most habit forming processes in the body and needs special nutritional support when trying to break habits.</P>
 <P> Much research has been done more recently at MIT on "carbohydrate hunger."  They have proven that Seratonin production in the brain is increased when increased levels of the amino acid, L-Tryptophan, get
into the brain. When enough Seratonin is produced, carbohydrate hunger increases.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AMINO ACIDS</H2>
<P>  SUPPORT TABS contain amino acids associated with the metabolic pathways of L-Tryptophan in the brain. Even though most people notice an energy boost when they take SUPPORT TABS, about 3% notice a feeling of relaxation, rather than increased energy.  A reaction of this type should be considered positive.</P>
<P>  L-Glutamine is considered to be helpful in mental alertness.   Vitamins B-l, B-2 and B-6 are included because they assist in the burning of glucose, which produces energy. However, the typical large amounts of B-vitamins, usually contained in stress formulas, are intentionally not included in SUPPORT TABS as they would cause the body to burn too much blood sugar quickly.   Mega-doses of B-vitamins give temporary energy, but once the sugar is burned, the same hypoglycemic "blahs" return in full force.  Thus, SUPPORT TABS contain a reasonable amount of B-vitamins to support the process naturally without creating a false stimulant effect that ultimately does more harm than good.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  SUPPORT TABS are formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE THEM</H2>
<P>   It  is  difficult to  say  exactly  how  one  should  take SUPPORT TABS as we all have different needs at different times. For best results, we recommend that you experiment.  Take at least three tablets per day. The general recommendation is three tablets two times per day, usually three early to mid afternoon and three in the late afternoon or evening.   Some people also prefer taking them in the morning.</P>

<H1>COLODYNE: 100% Natual Soluble Fiber, Herbs & Beneficial Micro-Flora </H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FIBER IS IMPORTANT </H2>

<P>  Most people should begin a nutritional program with COLODYNE. A great majority of people have a sluggish digestive tract and would absorb many more nutrients if they had the good digestive tract hygiene provided by COLODYNE.</P>
 <P> Because of modern junk food diets, lack of vigorous exercise and the lack of adequate fiber in the diet, most people's colons are not healthy.  When partially digested food remains in the colon too long it decays. Little pockets form in the colon, called diverticulae, which trap this decaying food and spawn harmful bacteria action. This often leads to serious infection and inflammation called diverticulitis. Many physicians believe that the toxic by-products of this decaying debris may actually be a major cause of colon and other cancers.  It is imperative that these pockets be emptied and cleansed of any mucous build-up to avoid inflammation and infection. Fiber is the main dietary ingredient to accomplish this.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW COLODYNE WORKS</H2>
<P>  COLODYNE is an easy way to get a reasonable amount of fiber quickly. Its bulk helps promote good healthy muscle tone for the muscles of the colon wall. The Black Walnut, Beet Root, Papaya and Bromelain enzymes in COLODYNE help loosen the mucous build-up from the colon walls so it can be eliminated. Do not be alarmed if you pass strings of mucous after using COLODYNE for a couple of weeks as this is a good sign that you are detoxifying.</P>
 <P>  If you set aside three days each month to  eat only raw fruit and drink juices plus take COLODYNE three times per day in juice, you will give your colon a good opportunity to cleanse itself routinely. You will be surprised how good you will feel.</P>
<P> COLODYNE also contains Lactobacillus Salivarius, Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Lactobacillus Bulgaricus and Lactobacillus Bifidus for beneficial bacteria that live in a healthy colon environment. These bacteria help in the synthesis of certain B vitamins, maintain proper colon pH, maintain normal consistency of stool and fight off` viruses, yeasts and harmful bacteria.</P>
<P>  COLODYNE also contains powdered Bentonite, a natural, high-quality clay that absorbs many toxins so they can be naturally eliminated.  Alginate is a sea weed substance that absorbs many toxic metals, especially aluminum, which is normally difficult for the body to eliminate.  Because aluminum cooking utensils have been so popular, aluminum toxicity is more widespread than recognized.  It can lead to depression   and   psychoses  and  be very damaging to heart muscle.</P>
<P>  The liver attempts to eliminate aluminum by incorporating it into the bile.   However, bile is ultimately secreted into the intestinal tract and most of the aluminum is reabsorbed. Alginate very efficiently holds the aluminum in the digestive tract so it can be eliminated through the stool.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  COLODYNE is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE COLODYNE</H2>
<P>  We recommend that COLODYNE be taken either in the morning right before breakfast or in the evening. Usually, one heaping teaspoonful, which provides 13 grams  of high  quality  soluble  fiber,  is  the recommended amount once a day. It is a good idea to take it twice a day for the first week or ten days.
  Place  one  to  two  heaping  teaspoonfuls  of  COLODYNE in a small jar or glass (with a lid) with three to four ounces of your favorite juice.  Usually, apple or orange juice is best. Shake briskly for about ten seconds and drink immediately. Do not let it stand after mixing as it will gel quickly and be difficult to swallow.  We recommend following with water or more juice to ensure adequate liquid. Use the extra liquid to remove  any remaining COLODYNE that may stick to the container. You may notice increased gas for a few days as you go through the initial phase of cleansing.</P>

<H1>DIUPLEX: Herbal Diuretic for to Eliminate Water Retention </H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HERBALS </H2>

<P>  Herbs  have  been  used  since  creation  to provide for our health and well being, for entire civilizations for that matter.  The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage.  Main stream modern technology is now finally beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies.  This is usually referred to in the literature today as phytotherapy.   We probably never will understand many of the secrets regarding how many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason to not take advantage of their benefits now.</P>
<P>  To our knowledge,  Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kinds of herbal based products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific nutritional goals.   These other synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and, at times, concentrated tissue nutrients.   By combining modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal based products are second to none anywhere in the world.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FLUID RETENTION</H2>
<P>  Consistent  use of DIUPLEX  may  result  in frequent elimination of water from the body. When the tissues retain too much water, it can create hydrostatic pressure that works against the blood vessels making it harder for efficient circulation to occur. This can cause elevated blood pressure and be an increased work load on the heart.</P>
<P>  For efficient weight loss to occur, the constant flushing of water from the body is necessary. Adepoise (fat) tissue retains water and its reduction naturally assists excess water elimination. This is a natural and beneficial cleansing action that can be supported by taking DIUPLEX while dieting.</P>
<P>  The kidneys do not actually eliminate water but they do eliminate sodium. When the sodium is transported by the kidneys, it is followed by water and thus diuresis occurs.</P>
<P>  However, because potassium is chemically very similar to sodium in certain ways, the kidneys sometimes perceive potassium to be sodium and it is eliminated instead of the sodium.  When excess potassium is eliminated, a feeling of tiredness is often experienced. Quite often, doctors prescribe high powered potassium salts to counteract this.  Then, they often discover that potassium products that are commonly used have a tendency to irritate the digestive tract and can actually go so far as to cause duodenal ulcers.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE DIUPLEX DIFFERENCE</H2>
<P>  The Life Plus DIUPLEX formula contains a small amount of potassium in each tablet. The small amount is not enough to cause any irritation to the intestines but it can help prevent possible depletion of potassium from the body due to the elimination of water. In addition, the potassium in DIUPLEX is in the form of a chelate, which is much more gentle on the digestive tract.</P>
<P>   A full 50 mg of Vitamin B-6 is included because of its natural diuretic effect when taken in this quantity. However, it should be taken with magnesium for best results.</P>
<P>  DIUPLEX also contains six different herbs including Buchu Leaves, Couch Grass, Corn Silk, Hydrangia Root, Uva Ursi and Peppermint. These herbs have been used for many years for their natural diuretic effect. This well liked product does not produce a strong "drug-like" effect that can be associated with unwanted side effects.  Instead, it provides a gentle, yet reliable diuretic effect.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  DIUPLEX is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty  natural  concentrates  of  numerous  valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE DIUPLEX</H2>
<P>  Since DIUPLEX is not a drug, but a natural product, some individuals need to take several tablets to notice its effect.  However, it is usually recommended that two to three tablets be taken in the morning and at mid-day. It is not wise to take it in the afternoon as its diuretic effect may carry over for several hours into the night, which could interfere with restful sleep.</P>

<BR><BR><BR>
<H1>WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PAK: Effective, Easy Weight Loss Program</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> QUALITY NUTRITION </H2>

 </P>The Life Plus WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PAK is a weight control program that is easy to use, yet extremely effective, especially when combined with a low fat diet and a reasonable program of regular exercise. The program consist of five great Life Plus products that are very synergistic when used together in the support of total weight management.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PRO-MAX</H2>
<P><A HREF="hpromax.htm"> PRO-MAX </A>is an unusual blend of natural plant source protein and complex carbohydrate. It contains high quality, soy-free protein from natural concentrated legume vegetable sources with a high P.E.R. (Protein Efficiency Ratio).  This ensures a high ratio of all eight essential amino acids.  It also contains a scientifically determined thirty percent complex carbohydrate from barley malt extract which contains many vitamins, minerals, micronutrients, enzymes and high quality soluble fiber.  PRO-MAX is both dairy and soy free, so persons with dairy and soy allergies can use it.  The taste of PRO-MAX is more pleasant than soy-based products. PRO-MAX was first developed to supply protein, carbohydrate and energy for athletes. In addition, it can be used as a low-calorie meal replacement when dieting, or as an excellent supplement in addition to regular meals.</P>
<P>   PRO-MAX is a highly nutritious supplement that provides the daily requirements of protein for lasting energy, while at the same time supplying complex carbohydrates for more immediate energy. Because of the combination of both high quality protein and high quality complex carbohydrate, PRO-MAX is particularly suitable for use by athletes and others with high energy expenditure requirements. PRO-MAX, especially when taken with <A HREF="htvm.htm">TVM-49</A>, is also suitable as a meal replacement for individuals on calorie-restricted diets. It is ideal for adding to milk, juices or other foods, fortifying them with protein and complex carbohydrate. At the same time, it is relatively fat free and ensures adequate levels of high quality protein while minimizing fat  intake. Because  PRO-MAX  is  so  easily  digested,  it  is  also excellent for fulfilling the nutrition requirements of both children and elderly individuals who have a tendency to not eat as they should.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COLODYNE</H2>
<P><A HREF="hcolodyn.htm"> COLODYNE</A> provides the much needed fiber and bulk in today's diet. The various fibers and herbs in COLODYNE help cleanse the lower intestine, especially the colon.  It helps to ease existing conditions resulting from a diet too low in fiber.   Because COLODYNE supplies bulk. it also helps correct chronic constipation. COLODYNE contains beneficial bacteria that normally live in the lower digestive tract, which promote proper colon hygiene. They also manufacture certain vitamins, help maintain proper pH and control overgrowth of infectious yeasts such as candida albicans. The fiber and betonite absorb toxins in the digestive tract that can arise from incomplete digestion or from contaminated foods in the diet. COLODYNE helps with the elimination of excessive mucous build-up that can occur in the colon from eating low fiber diets. This mucous build-up can harbor unfriendly bacteria and restrict absorption of needed nutrients.  Studies have shown that people with diets higher in natural fiber are less likely to develop arteriosclerosis and colon cancer.  It contains natural fiber, herbs and beneficial micro-flora that help maintain a healthy colon.</P>
<P>   COLODYNE is an easy way to get a reasonable amount of fiber quickly.  Its bulk helps promote good healthy muscle tone for the muscles of the colon wall. The Black Walnut, Beet Root, Papaya and Bromelain enzymes in COLODYNE help loosen the mucous build-up from the colon walls so it can be eliminated.  Do not be alarmed if you pass strings of mucous after using COLODYNE for a couple of weeks as this is actually a good sign that you are detoxifying.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENDOCRYN DHEA</H2>
<P><A HREF="hendo.htm">ENDOCRYN DHEA</A> contains 30 mg of real DHEA along with a highly concentrated and standardized blend of Mexican and Asian varieties of Dioscorea (Wild Yam). Dioscorea contains natural substances that serve as precursors for the body's endocrine system to manufacture its own DHEA. DHEA is used by our bodies to produce at lease 50 other hormones that are important in overall health. DHEA levels decrease as we age. One of the most exciting benefits of DHEA is its ability to burn fat and help you lose weight, plus keep it off by converting fat to muscle.</P>
<P>   DHEA's ability to facilitate this burning of fat may became one of the most significant finds in weight control. This effect does not seem to be so diet dependent as are other weight control supplements. No matter what you eat, DHEA still provides benefits of weight loss.</P>
<P>  DHEA's  ability  to  block  an  enzyme  named  G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase) may be one of the most significant finds of the century. This enzyme is not only essential for fat tissue but also promotes cancer cell growth.  By blocking it, DHEA's action of reducing body fat and helping to prevent against cancer may be explained.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUPPORT TABS</H2>
<P> The amino acids, concentrated tissue nutrients, specific vitamins and minerals in <A HREF="hsupt.htm">SUPPORT TABS</A> serve as fuel for the nervous system to provide energy, but also create a natural calming effect. They help greatly to maintain more consistent blood sugar levels helping the body maintain energy levels and control the ups and downs associated with low blood sugar levels. SUPPORT TABS are great for high stress situations such as those dieting, smokers or those trying to stop smoking, those trying to get off mind-altering drugs, heavy caffeine ingestion from coffee, chocolate or soft drinks, busy executives, students, people who travel a lot and individuals who seem to always be on the run. Many people have great results with SUPPORT TABS in helping them control excessive appetite and cravings.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SHAPE PLUS</H2>
<P><A HREF="hshape.htm"> SHAPE PLUS</A> is a unique herbal-based product that contains 23 different herbs selected for their high content of naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds.  These polyphenols have an astringent effect on the stomach and act as natural appetite suppressants. They are natural cleansing or detoxifying agents for both the digestive tract and throughout the whole body. These herbs, because of the natural polyphenols they contain, can reduce the amount of fat that is absorbed, thereby reducing calories.  They also help move food through the digestive tract at a normal rate, so those extra "empty calories" do not linger and become absorbed. When fewer calories are absorbed, the body will use up its own fat for energy.  The natural appetite control provided by SHAPE PLUS is a blessing to those trying to control their eating habits. The Chromium Picolinate in SHAPE PLUS reduces the craving for sweets and helps the body maintain proper blood sugar levels so the typical energy level ups and downs normally associated with dieting are greatly reduced. Chromium Picolinate also supports the conversion of fat to lean body tissue.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE THE WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PAK </H2>
<P>Mix two or more heaping tablespoonfuls of PRO-MAX and one heaping teaspoonful of COLODYNE in juice or skim milk as a meal replacement twice a day.  Take two SUPPORT TABS and one ENDOCRYN DHEA three times a day with meals. Take two or more SHAPE PLUS before meals and snacks.</P>

<H1>FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS: Beauty from Within </H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGING SKIN </H2>

 <P>  Premature aging of the skin due to excessive exposure to sunlight is an increasing problem across the world today.   It is characterized by thinning of the skin, wrinkles, yellowing, mottling and leathery dryness. It can easily lead to skin cancers of all types.  Photodamaged skin actually undergoes structural changes, along with the simultaneous loss of collagen and elastin. This loss causes less resilience in the skin making it appear aged.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MARINE CONCENTRATE</H2>
<P>  The unique marine concentrated extracts contained in FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS are obtained from certain cold water fish.  These have been shown to provide special nutrients that support both collagen and elastin production in the body and Lit the same time help protect them from destructive ultraviolet light and enzymes. This specific concentrated extract is made up of over 50% polysaccharide and 30% protein.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> OTHER NUTRIENTS</H2>
<P>  Other synergistic nutrients are included in FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS to help support healthy, vibrant skin including Vitamins A, D, E and C, Silica from herbal sources, Norwegian Kelp, hydrolyzed bovine collagen, rice protein and zinc.  These nutrients synergistically support healthy, youthful skin.</P>
<P>  All the ingredients in FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS are as completely natural as possible.   The active ingredients are either in their totally natural occurring state or have been concentrated for maximum results.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> YOUTHFUL RADIANCE</H2>
<P>   Your skin is the largest organ of your body and is the first thing someone sees when they look at you. As the aging process continues, the most visual changes occur here.  Our outward appearance influences how we feel about ourselves and how others see us.   By taking FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS, you can ensure that your skin receives many important nutrients valuable in revitalizing and preserving that youthful glow.</P>
<P> Younger skin cells are more vibrant and look more youthful than older ones. When they are supplied with the proper nutrients, they are able to retain moisture and contain more collagen, which results in healthy, thicker skin that is more elastic.</P>
<P>  FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS help your skin regain and retain its youthful radiance from within. It provides essential nutrients that feed the lower skin levels where new skin cells develop.  The combination of these fantastic tablets with the FOREVER YOUNG topical skin care products is the best way to have that youthful skin you have always wanted.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS are formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS</H2> 
<P>It is recommended to take one tablet twice a day, usually first thing in the morning and at bedtime. This is the minimum amount to take, and at the same time usually produces great results.  However, if you have damaged skin, or would like to get maximum results as soon as possible, more tablets should be taken. If you intend to be in the sun, it is a good idea to take several tablets for additional protection.  For maximum results, use FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS with the four great FOREVER YOUNG topical skin care products, <A HREF="hfyem.htm">EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</A>,<A HREF="hfyfp.htm"> FACIAL PERFECTING GEL</A>, <A HREF="hfydn.htm">DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX </A> and <A HREF="hfybp.htm">BODY PERFECTING LOTION</A>. However, the tablets can be taken alone if desired.  Other Life  Plus  products that are especially synergistic with FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS are <A HREF="hopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS</A> and <A HREF="hprotx.htm">PROTX II</A>.</P>

<H1>FOREVER YOUNG EMOLLIENT CLEANSER: Cleanses, Restores & Protects Facial Skin</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SEBACEOUS GLANDS </H2>

<P>   Detergents and soaps solubilize lipids on the skin and remove them, thereby disrupting the protective barrier of the skin. They also deplete the opening of the sebaceous gland of oils. This acts as a stimulus to the sebaceous gland to secrete more oil. This sets up a vicious cycle which creates more oil requiring more detergent use, thus more oil is produced. This action functions through a feedback system within the gland that senses the surface tension of the oil in the sebaceous duct, which serves to regulate the amount of oil produced by the gland. The action of the FOREVER YOUNG EMOLLIENT CLEANSER does not disrupt this healthy mechanism, but works in supporting it.  Consequently, the glands sense that adequate oil is in the duct and normalizes its production of oils.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FREE RADICALS</H2>
<P>   A little known fact about skin is the high potential that it has for generating free radicals.   This is inherent because of its protein nature.  Rubbing and grinding proteins has been shown by the scientific community to be an established method of generating lots of free radicals.  Using harsh abrasives on the skin not only breaks its surface, but also causes free radical formation, which further results in an inflammatory reaction in the skin. This inflammatory reaction will attract white blood cells to the area.  These cells carry highly irritating peroxides that are part of the defense mechanism used by the body to prevent infection in areas of damaged skin. So when the skin is artificially damaged by physical abrasion and chemicals in non-biologic cleansers, the body reacts in a way that can be easily monitored. FOREVER YOUNG EMOLLIENT CLEANSER is designed to be totally compatible with skin physiology and not produce free radicals when applied.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WALL OF DEFENSE</H2>
<P>   Functioning as the first line, or outer wall of defense, the skin needs a healthy set of mature cells at its periphery or outer layer.  This is the true battle zone, designed to withstand abrasions, infections, heat, moisture and cold.  It takes time to mature these outermost cells -- anywhere from 18 to 28 days. When the skin is irritated, the cells must move out faster to replace those that are injured or sloughed off. This is the basis  of  the  many  so-called  "natural  acid" products -- they are primarily nothing more than skin irritants.  These cells are immature cells, not younger cells!  You cannot send a child to do an adult's work. Even soaps can create this type of damage in about ten percent of individuals who have sensitive skin.  They coagulate the keratin proteins and denature them, which causes the lower cells to step up production to replace them.  With repeated use of soaps, some individuals experience a chronic inflammation of the skin. Housewives, nurses, dishwashers and those exposed to chemical cleansers and soaps frequently have this condition.</P>
<P>  As FOREVER YOUNG EMOLLIENT CLEANSER is spread over the skin, it removes peroxidized lipids and foreign matter, makeup and environmental contaminants. As it is removed with a soft, non-abrasive cloth or cotton, all this debris is carried away. A soft, well moisturized, texturized and protected skin is the result. The skin is protected with Vitamin E, Proanthocyanidins, Herbal Ingredients and other free radical scavengers, as well as deep penetrating skin, softeners that prepare the skin for the application of  <A HREF="hfyfp.htm">FOREVER FACIAL PERFECTING GEL </A> and <A HREF="hfydn.htm">DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX</A>. This is accomplished by adjusting the partition coefficient of the stratum corneum, providing retained moisture in the outer layer of the skin providing a silky pathway for the <A HREF="hfyfp.htm">FACIAL PERFECTING GEL</A> and/or <A HREF="hfydn.htm">DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX</A> and allowing greater penetration of them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</H2>
 <P>Place a small quantity of EMOLLIENT CLEANSER in the palm of your hand.  Apply the cleanser using a circular motion covering all areas of the face with a very thin layer. The circular motion is effective in removing dirt and makeup, while stimulating the skin cells at the same time. Remove the cleanser with a warm, damp, clean wash cloth. Do not use dry tissues, as they obtain harsh fibers, which may be unkind to delicate facial skin. Go over the face gently until all traces of makeup and dirt are removed, then pat dry. Your skin is now prepared to apply the<A HREF="hfyfp.htm"> FACIAL PERFECTING GEL</A>.</P>

<BR><BR><BR>

<H1>FOREVER YOUNG FACIAL PERFECTING GEL: Contouring and Firming Facial Gel</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FACIAL SKIN </H2>

<P>  Facial skin is the most exposed area on the body. Sunlight, extremes of temperature, blasts of hot and cold air,  environmental  toxins  and  other  offenders  like cigarette smoke insult it every minute of every day. It is never covered.  Yet, this small area of less than nine percent of our total skin surface suffers more than the other ninety one percent.  Also, our skin is stressed by internal factors that arise from internal emotional and metabolic factors.  Think of the phrase "putting on a good face" and understand the meaning of that phrase in terms of emotional stress pumped into our skin. Stress produces adrenaline related products, which not only restrict blood flow to our skin, but also generates potent, destructive free radicals. All of these forces combine to wreck havoc with the texture, color and resiliency of our skin. To help correct these problems with a view toward efficacy and ease of use, and to meet the demands placed on  facial  skin,  FOREVER  YOUNG  FACIAL PERFECTING GEL was developed.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> STRENGTHENING AND FIRMING</H2>
<P> The ingredients in FACIAL  PERFECTING GEL include  antioxidants  such  as  Vitamin E  and Anthocyanidins, as well as moisturizers and FOREVER YOUNG marine concentrate. In addition, it includes theophylline conjugated with Algisium Complex. All of these ingredients act to prevent free radical damage, either by quenching the free radicals, stopping a chain reaction of lipid peroxidation, or binding iron so that it does not react with the reactive oxygen species to form hydroxyl radicals. The overall action of the ingredients is to strengthen and firm the connective tissues in the dermis, particularly elastin and collagen. Along with the fat  deposits  beneath  the  skin,  these  proteins  are responsible for the shape and tone of the facial skin. Daily use of the product will result in firmer skin that resists wrinkling and sagging.   Sagging is mainly a gravitational effect, while wrinkling is an inflammatory response induced by free radicals. Both of these result from both exogenous (external as in sun exposure or cigarette smoke), or endogenous (internal as in toxic drug intake or alcohol abuse).
  Careful balancing of repair and protection functions in FOREVER YOUNG FACIAL PERFECTING GEL allow the use of several active ingredients that sense the need for repair at particular areas of the face.  The enzymes that replace worn or damaged collagen and elastin are assisted by these ingredients, which then effect the repair.   Critical to this process is the compatibility of the ingredients, not only to work in a synergistic manner with the normal skin physiological processes that maintain the skin in good repair, but also to aid and stimulate these processes as needed by the skin. The end results are the firming of the tissues and laying down of fresh, vibrant tissue that is responsible for the skin's strength and more youthful beauty.</P>


<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ANTIOXIDANTS</H2>
<P>  The  antioxidants  contained   in  FACIAL PERFECTING GEL not only slow down the peroxidation of the lipids, which destroys cells, but actually  protects  many  vital  cellular  functions, particularly the DNA in the cell. The long term benefit from   using   FOREVER YOUNG FACIAL PERFECTING GEL is that there is less tissue damage, fewer abnormal cells and a better protected skin. The net result is that chronic inflammation of the skin, which is associated with aging, is markedly reduced, so that continuing skin damage is averted and skin repair is now possible on a continuing basis. Supplying the skin with antioxidants makes good sense, since the body does not give the skin the best it has to offer. The skin, especially the facial skin, needs antioxidants every bit as much as any part of the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE FACIAL PERFECTING GEL </H2>
<P>After cleansing the face with the <A HREF="hfyem.htm">EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</A>, apply a small amount of FACIAL PERFECTING GEL to the five designated areas of the face. Smooth gently under the eyes, on the forehead and around the cheeks and lips. Do not apply to the lips. Then put a small amount under your chin and spread over the entire front of your neck area down to the collar bone. This will help to tighten and smooth your neck area. Allow the gel to dry completely for 1 to 2 minutes. Your skin  is  now  prepared  to  use  the  <A HREF="hfydn.htm">DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX</A>. Men also get the most benefit when they cleanse with <A HREF="hfyem.htm">EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</A>, but if they prefer to just use the PERFECTING GEL, they can. The best time for them to apply it is immediately after shaving.</P>

<H1>FOREVER YOUNG DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX: Protects & Restores Facial Skin</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> REPAIRING THE SKIN </H2>

<P>The ingredients in the FOREVER YOUNG DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX take advantage of the circadian rhythm characteristics of the body. Nighttime is reserved for repair of body tissues and the rebuilding of damaged systems, plus conserving and replenishing energy stores.  Cell division and growth occur at a much greater rate at night than during the day. This serves two purposes. The energy required for cell division need not be diverted for other causes, and the exposure to ultraviolet rays is less at night than during the day, which protects the vulnerable mitotic cell from radiation injury.</P>
<P>  The skin needs more nutrients to supply the raw materials for repair. These nutrients include amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and fuel to make it all happen. During the skin's repair process, the increased metabolic rate in some cells generates more free radicals through oxidative phosphorylation.  Antioxidants are needed to keep cellular damage in check; therefore, adequate antioxidants must be available both internally and topically as well. Vitamin C and Vitamin E are not well supplied to the skin by the body, so supplements are very worthwhile for the skin. As a matter of fact, the overall  nutritional  status of an  individual can be evaluated by looking at the skin.   The use of Proanthocyanidins   and   glutathione   provide   a cytoplasmic and extracellular source of super potent antioxidants that work with and support activity of other antioxidants.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VITAMIN A</H2>
<P>  High levels of Vitamin A in FOREVER YOUNG DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX provide retinol, which is ultimately converted to retinoic acid. It, then, acts as an inducer and controller of cell proliferation and creates a delicate balance of maintenance and new growth for repair of the skin. The beta glucans contained in   FOREVER  YOUNG   Marine  Concentrate  act primarily as a Langerhans cell stimulator which initiates a cascade of events that activates helper T-cells. This, in turn, activates macrophages that send out specific interleukens to turn on fibroblasts, enthothelial cells and kerationcytes.  This action results in a comprehensive physiological repair process that is an essential part of the biological surveillance and maintenance system of the body. New blood vessels and new connective tissues are laid down along with a renewal of epidermal cells. This stimulation of the Langerhans cells is a daily process, for they are the sentinel cells of the skin. In sun damaged skin they are markedly reduced so that the effectiveness of beta glucan is also reduced. This is a major reason that it is best to avoid extensive exposure to the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ELASTIN FORMATION </H2>
<P>The FOREVER YOUNG Marine Concentrate contained in the DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX stimulates the formation of elastin by an unknown mechanism. It stimulates epidermal growth and repair and balances skin tones for a smooth, even complexion.   These physiological responses are most likely immune in nature, and function through second messenger relays. Most of the reactions we see with the FOREVER YOUNG Marine Concentrate are immune reactions representing a complex series of steps that are largely unknown at this time, but are mainly mediated through helper T-cells and macrophages.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE THE DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX</H2>
<P>  After using <A HREF="hfyem.htm"> FOREVER YOUNG EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</A> and applying  <A HREF="hfyfp.htm">FACIAL PERFECTING GEL</A>, you are ready to apply the DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX.  It is a very highly concentrated cream and can produce fantastic results if used on a consistent basis. Apply lightly and easily over the entire face.  Do not get it in the eyes.  The day application is important to provide protection from the free radical action from exposure to the environment. The nighttime application enhances the body's ability to repair the facial skin while this process is most active. Gently massage FOREVER YOUNG DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX to the neck area as far back as the ears.   It will penetrate into the skin leaving no unpleasant residue. You will love its soft, pleasant feel and appreciate its non-greasy clean, smooth feeling.</P>

<BR><BR><BR>
<H1>FOREVER YOUNG BODY PERFECTING LOTION: Reduces Cellulite</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TYPES OF SKIN </H2>

<P>   The areas of the thighs, legs, arms, abdomen, buttocks and along the trunk are a different type of skin than the face. These areas have certain regional characteristics that must be respected when formulating a total skin care system. Body skin tends to be thicker and contain more fatty material than the facial skin. This body skin can tolerate a more vigorous cleansing and will actually shine when cleansed well.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW FAT IS BURNED</H2>
<P>  The natural xanthine compounds contained in the FOREVER YOUNG BODY PERFECTING LOTION are theophylline conjugates.  These facilitate penetration of theophylline into and through the skin, all the way down to the fat tissues, which are special cells known as lipocytes or adipcytes that contain the fat.  In order for fat to be burned, it must be broken down by the enzyme lipase. In order for this to happen, lipase must be activated. The activation of lipase takes place after the completion of a series of other enzyme reactions involving protein kinases. This series of reactions is called a "kinase cascade." That is, one kinase activates another, which activates another, etc. until lipase is finally activated.   Another substance, Cyclic AMP starts this cascade. The level of Cyclic AMP has to be controlled so the body's fat stores are not completely used up.  Another enzyme called PDE inactivates Cyclic AMP. This happens rapidly as PDE destroys Cyclic AMP almost as fast as it is formed. Theophylline inhibits PDE so the action of Cyclic AMP can be prolonged. In this way, breaking down of fat by lipase can continue longer. This results in the burning of fat, a restructuring of the body and loss of weight.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MOST BENEFIT</H2>
<P> It  is  important  that  when  you  use  FOREVER YOUNG BODY PERFECTING LOTION for cellulite loss, weight loss and re-shaping, that you understand what is happening so you can receive the most benefit. It facilitates the body's natural process of breaking down fat so that it can be used up and eliminated.  You will receive maximum benefit if you exercise after you apply it to the areas you want to reduce. When you apply it, calories are liberated from fat breaking down. If you exercise when this is happening, the specific calories from fat will be burned. The result is specific weight loss from fat, which is ideal. Lean body mass percentage will increase and it will be easier to maintain the loss. It is not necessary to be over zealous with your exercise. Usually reasonable amounts of regular exercise like walking or cycling is adequate. For example, apply BODY PERFECTING LOTION to thighs and abdomen and take a brisk walk. You will be surprised at the positive results.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FOOD INTAKE</H2>
<P> Food intake can play an important role. When we eat, insulin levels increase. Insulin blocks the action of lipase, which slows down body fat breakdown. This lessens the effect of theophylline. Therefore, if you desire maximum effects for cellulite or weight loss, delay eating for a while after applying BODY PERFECTING LOTION.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MULTI-FUNCTIONAL</H2>
<P> FOREVER YOUNG BODY PERFECTING LOTION is not just for reducing fat and cellulite.  It is a wonderful, general body lotion that makes the skin feel soft and supple and look great, too. The special concentrated oat protein contains antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents and iron chelating agents. It provides a soft matte finish to the skin, which tends to reduce the appearance of aging lines. At the same time, this finish tends to scatter sunlight, which reduces its energy and thus provides more protection from ultraviolet damage.  The application of the FOREVER YOUNG BODY PERFECTING LOTION results in multiple benefits, as it is multi-functional. Its hydration of the skin permits a softer feel, and at the same time does not interfere with healthy skin physiology. It provides a good moisturizing function to combat dry skin. Not only does dry skin not feel good, but it also sends signals to lower tissues to produce more cells.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUGGESTIONS</H2>
<P>  The contouring action of the BODY PERFECTING LOTION is aimed at reducing those areas of fatty tissue, which protrude into the skin's surface. The system is based on the enzymes described above and works best when combined with mild exercise and a slight reduction in diet. It is important, however, to understand that its many special synergistic ingredients have been designed to meet the needs of skin, regardless of the activity level one has. A mild exercise program, coupled with the use of the BODY PERFECTING LOTION, will provide maximum benefit to the skin. It increases the skin's blood supply, which in turn allows more of the active ingredients to reach deeper levels of the skin. When you can, vigorously cleanse your body with the FOREVER YOUNG BODY SPONGE, then apply BODY PERFECTING LOTION where desired action is wanted, especially where cellulite is present.</P>

<H1>FOREVER YOUNG EYE GEL: Reduces Puffiness & Restores Youthful Appearance</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FACIAL SKIN </H2>

 <P>  While facial skin is well supplied with blood circulation, it is also the most vulnerable part of the body to environmental damage. One of the main reasons for this is that the face is rarely covered. The extremely sensitive skin around the eyes is the most sensitive of all. In most areas of the body, the blood supply cools, warms and nourishes the skin, but facial skin and especially around the eyes, serves an additional function. That function is emotional response. Your facial expressions are always changing in response to what occurs around you.</P>
<P>   This added function creates tremendous stress in the facial skin and eye area.  All of these reactions require complex biochemical changes that occur constantly in our facial skin and some of these by-products are free radicals and some are hormones, such as adrenaline produced by the adrenal glands. The free radicals interact with normal skin structure and either have a destructive action or impair biological function. The end result is skin that is not healthy and looks dull and lifeless. This is particularly true concerning the delicate skin tissue around our eyes.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT</H2>
<P>   On top of these emotional stresses and free radical assaults, the ultraviolet light from the sun not only produces additional signs of aging, but is also the major cause of skin cancer. The infrared light from the sun heats the skin to dangerously high levels, even though we try to protect ourselves with sunscreens. Unfortunately, most sunscreens cannot be used close to the eyes. The heat denatures DNA and is a further cause of skin cancer, especially around the sensitive skin of the eye area.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> POLLUTANTS</H2>
<P>   We must also be aware of other environmental pollutants such as automobile exhaust and even the more serious effects of tobacco smoke. Hundreds of chemicals occur in tobacco smoke that cause adverse effects on skin, especially the skin around the eyes. Some of them are extremely dangerous, but none of them are beneficial. FOREVER YOUNG EYE GEL was developed with these factors in mind, knowing that not all stress can be avoided and not all pollutants eliminated. It helps counteract and repair these harmful effects on skin around the eyes and helps restore it to a more youthful, healthy appearance.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE MAGIC OF PLANT CHEMISTRY</H2>
<P>   Plants have adjusted to countless environmental insults and assaults over millions of years.  They have developed defense mechanisms against bugs, animals, harmful oxygen, pollutants and many other dangers. We study plants carefully and we find that some of them contain beneficial ingredients locked in them, which we are able to extract and use for our own good. That is exactly what we have done in formulating FOREVER YOUNG EYE GEL! It contains two significant natural plant extracts that work together synergistically to promote and assist the natural healing process of the facial skin, especially that skin surrounding the eyes. This is accomplished by increasing the nutrients to the area and targeting this specific area to help restore firmer skin.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MATE EXTRACT (PARAGUAY TEA)</H2>
<P>   This natural plant extract contains several health supporting substances that are beneficial to the skin.  Research has shown them to reduce fatty tissue, which helps to reduce bulging and puffiness around the eyes. At the same time, Mate Extract aids in increasing the flow of lymphatic fluid from and through the tissues surrounding the eyes.  This, of course, helps to restore swelling and increases the rate at which toxic wastes are carried away from the area as well. An even greater benefit of Mate Extract is that the structural components of the skin, collagen and elastin, are stimulated as well.  They are components of a lower layer of skin that provides the tone and firmness to give the skin quality of elasticity.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COLEUS</H2>
<P>  An exciting new ingredient in FOREVER YOUNG EYE GEL is obtained from a very special Coleus plant that is indigenous of the South American rainforests. It works synergistically with the Mate Extract to speed the rebuilding of tissues and direct specific repair action to support structural tissues, collagen and elastin so the skin is not only firmer, but more elastic as well. The ingredients in Coleus actually facilitate numerous biochemical reactions in the skin that are essential to healthy skin metabolism.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT</H2>
<P>   The condition of your skin is a determining factor. Usually it takes about six weeks for a skin wound to heal, so use this as a guide. Continuing use of FOREVER YOUNG EYE GEL has an additive or cumulative effect, so you should continue to see additional results with time. However, in some cases you will see results  in  only  a  couple  of  weeks.    If  you  are  using FOREVER YOUNG TABLETS and maintaining a reasonable nutrition and supplemental program with a reasonably healthy lifestyle, you will attain the greatest benefit from FOREVER YOUNG EYE GEL.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE FOREVER YOUNG EYE GEL</H2>
<P>  Apply one or two drops of FOREVER YOUNG EYE GEL twice a day to the sensitive skin below and around the eyes. Using the tip of your ring finger, apply very gently with the smallest amount of pressure possible. Be careful to not pull the skin away from the eyes.  While it is designed for the sensitive skin surrounding the eyes, FOREVER YOUNG EYE GEL can also be used anywhere on the body, especially on areas that are damaged and have lots of wrinkles.</P>

<H1>FOREVER YOUNG FACIAL SKIN CARE SYSTEM: Clinically Proven, State-of-the-Art</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGING </H2>

<P>Aging is a continuous process of gradual loss of functionality associated with chronic inflammation. The body has an enormous capacity to repair damage if given a  little  help  from  our  diets,  supplements,  reasonable exercise and good skin care.  Some of the oxygen we breathe is converted to dangerous free radicals. Our skin is exposed to numerous toxins every minute of every day. Free radicals damage our DNA, which results in aging and disease. <B><I>This does not have to happen, especially at the rate it is happening today. It can be controlled.</I></B></P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGING SKIN</H2>
<P> The skin ages due to DNA damage, which is induced by both chemical and physical means. The first signs we see in any individual in regards to aging is their skin.  The first signs we see are structural changes like wrinkles and sagging then color and texture changes. Red spots and dilated veins appear. Brown spots appear on hands and face and the skin becomes thinner and less elastic. Structural changes result when collagen and elastin quantity and quality are reduced. Your skin is an open book to your state of health. Of all things the skin tells us the most about a person.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE SCIENCE </H2>
<P>The science behind the FOREVER YOUNG FACIAL SKIN CARE SYSTEM is based on a thorough knowledge of skin physiology and the real biological needs of the body to maintain itself in good repair. Since skin is damaged both from the inside and outside the body,  a  system  that  recognizes  the  need  for comprehensive treatment, to correct the combined problems simultaneously, is the only one that can be truly effective.   The  FOREVER YOUNG FACIAL SKIN CARE SYSTEM meets these requirements by supplying you with the most sophisticated skin care system modern science has ever achieved.  The FOREVER YOUNG FACIAL SKIN CARE SYSTEM topically corrects underlying skin damaged by assisting the body's repair mechanism to restore the skin to a youthful appearance; then, internally helps in  preventing further damage by blocking and neutralizing free radical activity with powerful antioxidants.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT TO EXPECT</H2> 
<P>There are two things that determine the result you obtain. The first is based on your commitment. The second is based on the degree of damage you now have. The more severe the damage, the longer it will take. Many years of sunbathing or heavy smoking produce leathery skin that takes longer to repair, but positive results can be achieved if you  continue  the  program.   While  most  users  see results in as little as a month, others will require three to four months. Using it twice a day will produce better results than using it once daily.</P>

<H1>LYPRINOL: A Natural Anti-Inflammatory to Help Relieve Joint Pain from Arthritis</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VALUABLE LIPIDS (PUFA'S) </H2>

 <P>  In recent years, interest has matured regarding lipid compounds, which have evolved as valuable nutritional substances. One group of these are the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA's). These fatty acids are named by identifying the number of carbon atoms in their molecule and indicating the number of double or unsaturated bonds. For instance, a PUFA with eighteen carbons and three double bonds would be called 18:3 by scientists.   Some well known sources of PUFA's are the unsaturated cooking oils such as sunflower and canola oils. Soybean oil is well known for its content of PUFA's. Fish oils, which have been researched for their ability to reduce cholesterol and improve health of the heart and circulatory system, also contain PUFA's.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> OMEGA 6 & OMEGA 3</H2>
 <P>  Two basic categories of PUFA's that have received a lot of attention relative to human nutrition are the Omega 6 and Omega 3's. Omega 6 PUFA's are contained in all vegetable oils. Omega 6's are almost totally made up of linoleic acid (18:2) and it's derivatives. Some of the Omega 6's are considered more valuable, such as GLA (gamma linolenic, 18:3) found in evening primrose and borage oils. Omega 3's are found to a limited degree in some plants but are contained in all fish and shellfish.  For instance, canola and flax oils contain alpha linolenic acid (18:3).  The Omega 3 PUFA's contained in fish are from five to ten times more powerful in their biological activity than those found in plants.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TERMINOLOGY</H2>
 <P>  There are three known valuable Omega 3 PUFA's in fish. They are  EPA,  DHA  and  the  amazing  LYPRINOL.    EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), the most well known, is usually accompanied by DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). Eicosa means 20, docosa means 22, pent means 5 and hex means 6. So then, eicosapentaenoic acid could be described as 20:5, and docosahexaenoic as 22:6. All this terminology is simply to bring us to a more detailed understanding for discussion purposes about LYPRINOL. We may call them "Super" Omega 3's.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> LYPRINOL</H2>
<P>   The most current research is now demonstrating a whole new group of related, but different PUFA's. Over twenty years of research has produced a better understanding of ETA (eicosaetraennoic acid). ETA is a 20:4, a twenty carbon molecule with four double bonds.  These newly found and isolated compounds have the greatest biological activity of all and show amazing promise for those who need to supplement with them.</P>
<P>  The most valuable ETA's have been extracted from the New Zealand Green-Lipped Mussel, Perna canaliculus. This unique mussel has been used as food for many years in that part of the world and seems to have added greatly to the health of those including it in their diet. One noticeable trait is that they seem to have a significant decrease in stiffness and joint swelling and discomfort as they age. This lead researchers to try to understand why this was so. Scientists have been conducting research on the New Zealand Green-Lipped Mussel now for over thirty years and have been learning some very important facts.</P>
<P>   It  is  acknowledged  by  many  scientists  and  government committees around the world that the western diet provides more Omega 6 PUFA's relative to Omega 3's. This leads to our cellular 
membranes becoming rich in the Omega 6's such as arachidonic acid, which is a precursor to certain molecules that can cause inflammatory processes associated with arthritis, psoriasis and asthma to name a few. Many studies have reported that certain lipids from fish and other marine sources can have a beneficial effect on our overall health when they are a part of the diet on a routine basis.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PERNA CANALICULUS</H2>
<P>   Freeze-dried concentrated and encapsulated mussel tissue in it's raw state was used originally as a natural food supplement for the prevention of pain normally associated with older individuals experiencing joint and muscle discomfort.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> POTENCY</H2>
<P>   There is no doubt among scientists who are aware of this state-of-the-art research that LYPRINOL has evolved as the most potent of all these "Super GLA's", regardless of their source. Independent studies carried out in Australia at the University of Queensland have shown LYPRINOL to be:  200 times more potent that Max EPA, 250 times more potent than Green-Lipped Mussel Extract, 350 times more potent than Evening Primrose Oil, 350 times more potent than Salmon Oil and 400 times more potent than Flax Oil.</P>
<P>   Following fifteen years of scientific research by independent scientists working closely with the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), the goal was achieved with the identification of the principal components responsible for the extract's high potency. The compounds were patented and named LYPRINOL.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS</H2>
<P>   LYPRINOL has been exposed to critical review by researchers at the Universities of Adelaide and Queensland in Australia. Leukotrienes are formed in the body and are known to be responsible for initiating and prolonging the process of inflammation. These leukotrienes are formed by what researchers call the lipoxygenase pathway.   The concentrated ETA's (eicosatetraenoic acids) contained in LYPRINOL have been shown to be potent inhibitors of this lipoxygenase pathway and this is one reason it is believed that individuals with diets rich in ETA's seem to have less discomfort as they age. And, according to the University of Adelaide scientists, "the results were extraordinary" and "these compounds are really very potent nutritional inhibitors of the lipoxygenase pathway."</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE LYPRINOL</H2>
<P>   Most people should begin with two capsules twice a day for one or two weeks. Some may try three times a day during this period. Then, decrease to one or two capsules once or twice a day as desired. The daily level needed to obtain maximum effect can vary for each individual. If your body requires less, temporary initial irritation of symptoms may occur with too high a dosage. If this occurs,  simply decrease the amount taken.   Some individuals with serious needs may not receive maximum benefit from LYPRINOL for four weeks, so it is important to not discontinue too soon.</P>

<H1>COLLOIDAL SILVER: All Natural Anti-Microbial Solution </H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>COLLOIDAL SILVER </H2> 
 <P>COLLOIDAL SILVER is an amazing natural alternative to antibiotics. <B>There is no disease causing bacteria that can live in the presence of even minute traces of metallic silver.</B>Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER contains only aural ingredients that help the body fight infections just like synthetic antibiotics, but without their damaging side effects. Its natural light golden color is characteristic of its high quality. The concentration of five parts of silver per million contained Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER is the most effective, safe formulation available. Higher concentrations can actually be less effective as they may interfere with beneficial bacteria and cause skin discoloration, even when used internally. Every family desiring optimum natural health should have a bottle of Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER in the medicine cabinet.</P>
<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>QUALITY</H2>
<P>The Life Plus top grade COLLOIDAL SILVER is produced by a highly technical electrocolloidal method employing an electrical current. It has a pH of approximately 6.5 and is a natural golden color. Usually, an antibiotic kills a half dozen or so bacteria, but silver kills some 650. Resistant strains do not develop to silver like they do with antibiotics.</P>
<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>HISTORY</H2>
<P>Silver was used as a proven germ fighter in the early 1900's. It was the mainstay of antibiotic treatment, and today's technology is even more superior. The medical journal <I>Lancet</I> reported phenomenal results from colloidal silver in 1914. Dr. Henry Crooks showed colloidal silver to be highly germicidal yet absolutely harmless and non-toxic to humans. Colloidal Silver has been proven useful against all species of fungi, bacteria, protozoa, parasites and certain viruses, which are often killed within minutes. L>C> For, M>D> at the UCLA School of Medicine reported in 1988 that silver solutions were effective against Streptococcus, Pyogenes, Staphylococcus Aures, Neisseria Gonorrhea, Garnerella, Vaginalis, Salmonella Typhu and other enteric pathogens. He also found that it was fungicidal for Candida Albicans, Candida Globata and M. Furfur.</P>
<P><I>Science Digest</I> reported in an article in 1978, entitled "Our Mightiest Germ Fighter" that "silver is emerging as a wonder of  modern medicine." Dr. Robert O. Becker, M.D. stated, "we have rediscovered the fact that silver kills bacteria, which had been known for centuries...when antibiotics were discovered, uses for silver as an antibiotic were discarded."</P>
<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>COLLOID</H2>
<P>The term "colloid" refers to a substance that consists of ultra-fine particles within the range of 0.005 to 0.015 microns in diameter. In a true colloid, like Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER, these particles cannot be seen by the naked eye and stay suspended as they are electrically charged. This activates the germicidal quality of the silver.</P>
<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>PRODUCTION</H2>
<P>The "grind" method can b used, but the particles are too large and a protein, or other, stabilizer has to be included. However, stabilizers can interfere with effectiveness. Also, a chemical process can be used but the end product is usually too acid and not as effective.</P>
<P>Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER is produced by the electrocolloidal process, which allows extremely fine silver particles to be suspended in solution by the tiny charge placed n them. This process replaces the need for any chemicals or stabilizers and the product can be called a true colloid. Then, the particles can remain in suspension almost indefinitely.</P>
<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>COLOR</H2>
<P>Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER is the ideal golden yellow color. Other products that are not true colloids will be another color, unless coloring is added. Color is a critical indicator of colloidal silver quality.</P>
<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>AS NATURE INTENDED</H2>
<P>Dr. Gary Smith suggests that silver may be linked to the proper functioning of our immune system and that people with inadequate intakes may be more prone to infection. True colloidal silver in the range of three to five parts per million (ppm) has little effect on the friendly bacteria in our digestive tract however, be aware of products of higher concentration as they can attack friendly bacteria just like some antibiotics. This could upset your natural balance and lead to another complication. With colloidal silver, higher concentrations are not necessarily better. As a matter of fact, the opposite is usually true.</P>
<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>HOW TO USE COLLOIDAL SILVER</H2>
<P>When used as an antibiotic, adults and children twelve and older, take one, two or three teaspoonfuls of Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER by mouth three times a day. Younger children can take half this amount. It is tasteless, odorless and non-irritating to sensitive tissues such as the eyes, so it can also be used like a first aid spray on cuts, sores, burns, insect bites, etc.</P>
<P>Life Plus COLLOIDAL SILVER is furnished with a sprayer top on the bottle. The sprayer makes it convenient to use as a topical spray. However, it is recommended that you also spray it into the mouth when taking it orally. Forty pumps from the sprayer equals one teaspoonful of solution. For maximum utilization, pump several sprays into the mouth, hold for a few seconds and swallow. Repeat this process until forty full pumps are swallowed for each teaspoonful desired. This allows the silver to be absorbed sublingually (under the tongue), getting it into the system sooner, plus bypassing the intestinal flora.</P>

<H1>SOMNISET: Melatonin & Synergistic Nutrients</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS </H2>

<P>   Many biological functions are rhythmic such as the short rhythms of breathing and heartbeat. Longer patterns are common, such as monthly menstrual cycles and annual seasonal cycles.  Daily rhythms are called circadian, from circa" meaning about, and "dies" meaning day. The daily rise and fall of blood pressure, excretions and changes in body temperature are known, but the most common is the melatonin induced sleep/wake cycle. By changing the length of time we are exposed to varying intensities of light during a day, it is possible to affect the timing of melatonin production and disrupt our sleep patterns. This can be experienced with jet travel.  As we traverse several time zones, our production of melatonin gets out of sync with the new time causing jet lag. Also, if one's job requires them to work different shifts, it can take days to get used to the new time resulting in feeling tired most of the time. Understanding circadian rhythms can be meaningful. Vitality is lowest at midnight. For example, death after surgery occurs three times as frequently at midnight than noon. Benefits of taking medications and supplements can be maximized taking these cycles into account. Biological clocks are known to become disorganized in diseased states. This lack of synchronization may not be a mere symptom but part of the disease itself.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PINEAL GLAND</H2>
<P>   The pineal gland is located in the brain and serves as a "light detector" or "third eye."   Light sets the timing mechanism of the brain's internal clock each morning as it enters the lens of the eye and stimulates the retina. Impulses are sent to the hypothalamus and transmitted along the optic nerve and into the sympathetic nervous system and the pineal gland. These impulses inhibit the activity of an enzyme required to produce melatonin, so melatonin production decreases. Then, each night the "clock" signals the pineal gland to secrete the sleep producing hormone melatonin.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SLEEP</H2>
<P>  Lowered levels of nighttime melatonin reduce the quality of sleep resulting in the need for more sleep. If your pineal gland does not produce adequate melatonin early enough in the evening, it is difficult to go to sleep. If secretion does not continue, you may wake up too soon. If your pineal gland secretes too much or for too long into the next day, you will have a tendency to be sleepy and not rested the next morning. Continuing melatonin production into the day can also result in depression and tiredness. If you do not get adequate sleep, mental acuity decreases, too. Insomnia exists when melatonin levels are low or when it is produced at the wrong time. Supplementing can help re-establish balance and help you set your biological clock.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENDOCRINE & IMMUNE SYSTEMS</H2>
<P>   There is a close correlation between the pineal and the pituitary/adrenal endocrine glands. Low melatonin levels are associated with lessened thymus activity, steroids metabolism and depression. Much of the activity of the immune system takes place at night and it is thought that melatonin interacts 
with our immune system during sleep. Melatonin may be an anti-stress factor and its normal rhythmic release is a buffering device, quenching the adverse effects of stress on the immune system. Some researchers believe the steady increase in the incidence of cancer is partially because of the extended time we are exposed to artificial lighting. This results in extended hours each day that melatonin production is suppressed when levels would have been higher longer. Melatonin levels of breast and prostate patients are reduced to half the normal levels.  Conditions associated with elevated estrogen levels such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis and premenstrual syndrome may be prevented by normal systemic levels of melatonin.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BRAIN & CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM</H2>
<P>   Melatonin stabilizes electrical activity of the central nervous system. The pineal, primarily through melatonin, acts as a synchronizing and stabilizing organ. Nighttime melatonin levels are low in people with major depressive and panic disorders.  Individuals with noticeable mood swings or melancholy also have depressed melatonin levels.  Both seasonal  affective  disorders  and  non-seasonal  cyclic depressions are related to the peaks and valleys of melatonin levels.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGING</H2>
<P>  Stress and/or dietary lack of tryptophan may make deficiencies of melatonin common. Older individuals have a reduced ability to produce melatonin. The relationships of endocrine rhythms, mood, sleep and the biological effects of light are complex. Since melatonin secretion declines with age, many researchers believe that it may help prevent age-related and free radical mediated brain damage. The melatonin corticoid  relationship  has  significance  since  chronic hypercortisolemia has been associated with age related deterioration of the brain (including Alzheimer's disease), glucose intolerance, atherosclerosis, impaired immune function and cancer. Melatonin appears to mediate the entire aging process.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE </H2>
<P>SOMNISET is formulated in the proprietary Life PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty   natural   concentrates   of  numerous   valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products. you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE IT</H2>
 <P>  The recommended range is from one to five tablets from about  thirty to forty-five minutes before  bedtime. SOMNISET is not a drug but a natural supplement supportive of natural metabolic rhythms, so several days supplementation may be needed to begin seeing results. Start with one or two tablets and increase as needed after three nights. More is not necessarily better if not needed.</P>

<H1>ECOLOGY PAK: Nutritionally Establishes Bowel Ecology </H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> YEAST</H2>
<P>Candida Albicans is the technical name for a yeast that is a normal inhabitant of the human body. It is passed to us from contact with others either at or shortly after birth, and remains with us throughout our lives. It quickly finds its way onto our skin and into our intestinal tracts where it takes up residence with other microorganisms.  Under normal conditions, Candida Albicans live and perform normal vital tasks in harmony with all of their neighbors within our body.</P>
<P>  Over the past forty years the occurrence of elevated levels of yeast have increased dramatically in many people to the point that it has become a problem for hundreds of thousands of individuals. Part of the reason is the more extensive use of  some of the modern immune system depressing drugs such as the steroids like hydrocortisone and antibiotics. They help create an environment that is ideal for overgrowth of Candida yeast. When the Candida balance is shifted slightly, the result can be a vaginal discharge, anal itching, or an oral yeast infection usually called thrush, which deposits an aggravating white coating on the tongue. In the severely debilitated person, the yeast can grow very rapidly, creating a number  of problems ranging from headaches, joint pain, night sweats, fatigue and allergies to severe mental and physical disorders. Quite often people have a general overall feeling of malaise.   They don't feel good and have difficulty concentrating.  Many people with this problem seem to walk around in a daze.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT PROGRAM</H2>
<P>  A comprehensive nutritional support program is important in interrupting the self perpetuating cycle of yeast overgrowth.  The use of a carefully selected nutritional program along with dietary measures can help restore the normal balance necessary to keep these microorganisms in check. The basics of such a diet are to severely limit the simple carbohydrates (sugars) in your diet,  avoid  fungus  or yeast containing foods  like mushrooms, wines, etc., concentrate on foods that are known to be good for the immune system and supplement with specific products that fight the yeast naturally and help restore healthy ecology of the digestive tract.</P>
<P>  ECOLOGY PAK is the only program of its kind that supplies the many special amino acids such as L-Cysteine and L-Tyrosine, along with others known for their natural detoxifying and immune supportive effects. They also help maintain consistent blood sugar levels that is so important in yeast management.  Also included in ECOLOGY NO. 1 are the synergistic herbs, Pau d' Arco, Clove and Horse-radish. These special herbs are known for their nutritional effect of naturally supporting the healthy ecology of the intestinal tract. Restoring normal colon ecology plays a key role in maintaining a healthy immune system. The normal healthy colon contains a considerable amount  of fatty  acids  as  byproducts  of the bacterial breakdown of dietary fiber and other organic material. These fatty acids play a key role in maintaining the proper balance between yeast, healthy bacteria and other microorganisms that inhabit our digestive tracts naturally.</P>
<P>  ECOLOGY NO. 1 supplies many of the nutrients necessary for support of the immune system while at the same  time  helping  the  body  deal  with  the toxicity created by an imbalance of yeast organisms. Along with generous amounts of Vitamin A in the form of Beta-Carotene and Vitamin C as Calcium Ascorbate, ECOLOGY NO. 1 supplies concentrated tissue nutrients from Thymus, Lymph and Spleen, all of which provide nutritional support for the immune system. Also included is Zinc, which is also well known as a natural immune stimulant.</P>
<P>  ECOLOGY NO. 2 provides a generous amount of these short-chain fatty acids as Caprylic Acid and Undecylenic Acid. These fatty acids are carefully manufactured in a special tablet form to ensure a constant slow release along the intestinal tract.  They work in combination to help restore and preserve the body's normal ecological balance between yeast and bacteria.</P>
<P>  ECOLOGY NO. 3 is a concentrated form of a synergistic combination of different bio-cultures from Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Lactobacillus Bulgaricus, Lactobacillus  Bifidus  and  Lactobacillus  Salivarius. Normally these microorganisms help maintain proper pH in the colon and provide a number of other health supporting benefits.   They are normally present in low levels when yeast overgrowth is present. Supplementing with ECOLOGY NO. 3 is the ideal way to help re-establish them in the colon.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  Both ECOLOGY NO. 1 and ECOLOGY NO. 2 are formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added  benefit  of receiving  the  numerous  health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE ECOLOGY PAK </H2>
<P>Take two ECOLOGY NO. 1 tablets three times a day with meals.  Take one ECOLOGY NO. 2 tablet plus one-half teaspoonful of ECOLOGY NO. 3 and one heaping teaspoonful of  COLODYNE twice a day between meals. Take one heaping teaspoonful of  COLODYNE twice a day between meals. For best results it is important to avoid refined carbohydrate-s (sugars) in the diet as well as known fungus and yeast containing foods such as mushrooms, wines and yeast breads. Eat foods known to be of value for the immune system. Eat lots of vegetables and plenty of fiber. </P>
<BR><BR><BR>
<P>  ECOLOGY NO. 1 tablets are a broad spectrum supplement that provide many nutrients that support 
the immune system, while helping the body deal with toxicity of yeast imbalance.  It contains Pau d'Arco 
herb because of its natural ability to fight yeast.  </P>

<H1>INNER ACT: Herbal Laxitive</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> INNER ACT</H2>

<P>Herbs  have  been used  since  creation  to provide for our health and well being, for entire civilizations for that matter. The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage.  Main stream modern technology is now finally beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies.  This is usually referred to in the literature today  as phytotherapy.  We probably never will understand many of the secrets regarding how many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason to not take advantage of their benefits now.</P>
<P>  To our knowledge, Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kinds of herbal-based-products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific   nutritional   goals.  These synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, anti-oxidants, and, at times, concentrated tissue nutrients.  By combining modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal-based-products are second to none anywhere in the world.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> UNIQUE COMBINATION</H2>
<P>  INNER ACT is a unique combination of herbs and herbal extracts, which can be a very important product if you need it. The lack of fiber in the diets of most individuals today often results in the muscles of their colons not receiving adequate "stretching" because of a lack of bulk.   As a result, they do not get enough stimulation for contraction which can result in too slow movement of food through the lower digestive tract. This is usually referred to as a sluggish colon.</P>
<P>  INNER ACT contains ten herbal ingredients. They include Rhubarb Root, Licorice Root, Fennel Seed and Anise Seed. The Irish Moss in INNER ACT contains a high proportion of a natural gum that lubricates and soothes the colon and absorbs toxins. A small amount of dehydrated Prune Concentrate is also included.</P>
<P>  Prune Concentrate contains a high percentage of natural compounds that are known to be good detoxifiers and cleansers and it also helps to stimulate peristalsis (movement of the muscles in the colon helping the process of elimination). Parsley is a natural cleanser and works well with the other herbs in this preferred preparation.</P>
<P>  The predominant herbal ingredients in INNER ACT are Cascara Sagrada Bark and Senna Leaf Powder. These two herbs have been used for many decades as natural herbal laxatives.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
 <P> INNER ACT is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE INNER ACT</H2>
<P>  A high percentage of older people love INNER ACT because they often have sluggish colons.   They comment that they have more energy and feel better when they take steps to ensure that their lower digestive tracts (colons) stay cleaned out.  Many of them do not have  regular elimination.    But  many  younger people have the same problem, including teenagers.</P>
<P>  It is strongly recommended that almost everyone use <A HREF="hcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> every day and then take INNER ACT when needed. In general, it is a good idea to take INNER ACT for one or two days each month. Some people may need it weekly. You will have to be your own judge and tailor its use to your needs.</P>
<P>   Usually two to four tablets are taken at one time. It is recommended to take them at bedtime.  Usually an elimination will occur the next morning. It is not recommended to take them in the morning or afternoon as elimination may occur during the day.</P>
<P>  In the past it has been thought that consistent use of INNER ACT could result in dependence. This, of course, is of consideration when it, or any other laxative, is used on a daily basis, over a long period of time.  We have not seen this to be a problem and recommend that you concentrate on eating a natural diet as much as possible, take <A HREF="hcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> daily, walk a reasonable amount each day and take Life Plus INNER ACT as needed.</P>

<H1>SUSTENASE: Two Phase Digestive Enzymes Buffered with Micro-Flora</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ABSORPTION </H2>

<P>   SUSTENASE is designed to help us digest our foods naturally and properly so we can absorb the nutrients we eat.   It helps to maintain a healthy digestive tract by reducing the amount of undigested foodstuffs remaining and to maintain healthy pHs throughout the digestive tract.    It also  supplies  a representative  amount of beneficial micro-flora also supporting bowel ecology. It has been said that "we are what we eat." That is only partially true.  We are made of what we eat, digest, absorb and assimilate into our bodies.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DIGESTION OF FOODS</H2>
 <P>  Digestion starts in the mouth with chewing the foods we eat. In the saliva is an enzyme, Ptylin, that begins to break down starches into more simple sugars.</P>
<P>   When food is swallowed, the stomach takes over by secreting Hydrochloric Acid and the enzyme, Pepsin. Hydrochloric Acid further digests the starches and begins protein digestion.</P>
<P>   In about 30 minutes the food leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine, where it is exposed to more digestive enzymes secreted by the pancreas.   They consist of (l) Proteases to digest proteins, (2) Amylases to digest starches, and (3) Lipases to digest fats.   In addition to these, the gall bladder secretes bile for the emulsification and digestion of fats.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> INDIGESTION</H2>
 <P>   If the body is healthy and working properly, it should produce all of these enzymes in sufficient quantities to ensure proper digestion. However, many people do not produce enough of these enzymes. As a result, they often get the common symptoms of indigestion, such as gas, bloating, heartburn and constipation.  Unfortunately, thousands of people take antacids because they have seen the ads on TV that convince them they have too much stomach acid when, in most cases, the reverse is actually true.</P>
 <P>  Antacids actually slow down or even stop the digestive process and give only temporary relief. Antacids only postpone the long term problems that arise from improper digestion.  It is much more rational to supplement the body with natural enzymes to ensure that the digestive tract can digest the food properly.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TWO PHASES</H2>
<P>   SUSTENASE is a two-phase digestive supplement formulated in a unique manner so that it releases certain enzymes and buffering agents in the stomach and others in the small intestine.</P>
<P>   To provide supplemental acid in the stomach, SUSTENASE releases Betaine HCl and Glutamic Acid HCl.  In addition, SUSTENASE releases the active protein digesting enzymes Pepsin, Papayotin and Bromelain in the first phase in the stomach, where protein digestion begins.</P>
 <P>  When food leaves the acidic stomach, it enters the more alkaline intestinal environment. Each phase of the SUSTENASE tablet is buffered to conform to each environment to provide maximum activity of the enzymes in each location.  In its second phase, SUSTENASE releases Pancreatin, a concentrated mixture of enzymes that digest proteins, fats and complex carbohydrates (starches).  It also releases Pancrelipase, a highly active form of concentrated pancreas enzymes that is especially good for fat digestion plus Ox Bile concentrate for the emulsification and digestion of fats.</P>
<P>   Because indigestion is such a widespread problem, SUSTENASE is one of the most popular Life Plus products, one that should be taken by just about everyone. Without proper digestion, the food we eat is of no value to us, no matter how many nutrients are in it. Improper digestion may also cause food allergies as well as other types of allergies.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>   SUSTENASE is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
   When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE IT</H2>
<P>   Take one or more SUSTENASE tablets with each meal. It is best to take them as you begin the meal so the digestive enzymes and buffering agents can be mixed well with the food being eaten. With large meals and those high in fats and heavy proteins such as large steak dinners, etc. more tablets can be taken if desired. If you should forget and not take your SUSTENASE at the beginning of the meal, take it later in the meal or even after the meal is eaten. You will still obtain benefits from it.</P>

<H1>SALIVAREX: L-Salivarius Plus Other Beneficial Micro-Flora</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BACTERIA </H2>

<P>   Bacteria are everywhere. We swallow them with our food, drink them with water, they are in the air we breathe, on our skin, in our mouths, digestive tract, sinuses and other areas of our bodies.  In so far as health is concerned, some of them are harmful, some neutral and some are very beneficial. Some are extremely valuable for good health as they work harmoniously with our immune system.  In a healthy colon, there are literally billions of beneficial or "friendly" bacteria. Under favorable conditions, they multiply at a fast enough rate to keep pace with the large numbers that are lost during elimination.  Bacteria is also referred to as micro-organisms. When they are located in the intestinal tract, they are referred to as "intestinal flora," micro-flora or sometimes just "flora".</P>
<P>   These friendly bacteria synthesize many important vitamins in the digestive tract including vitamin K and some of the B vitamins. A very important function they perform is helping the colon maintain a proper pH or acid-base balance. It is necessary for the pH to stay in the correct range in order for other health supporting bacteria to exist. It is also important to keep levels of antagonistic micro-organisms under control.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> LOW LEVELS</H2>
<P>   At times, the taking of antibiotics can be necessary, even life saving. When we take them to kill off the infectious bacteria, we also destroy large amounts of the beneficial flora in our digestive tracts.  When the level becomes disturbed, or when the bowel ecology becomes out of balance, health problems can develop. In this instance, it is important to replenish the friendly bacteria as soon as possible in order to maintain good health. They can be replaced by concentrating on eating foods they are contained in and supplementing with SALIVAREX.</P>
<P>   Dairy products are a good source of friendly lactobacillus, especially yogurt and kefir. However, the milk that most people drink today is pasteurized, or heated to about 165 degrees F. So, for the most part, we have lost this source of lactobacillus in our diets and are not receiving the quantities of these bacteria in our diets as we used to. It is a good idea to routinely eat some live culture containing foods such as yogurt, kefir, etc. Be sure the products are guaranteed to contain live cultures. It is actually best to make your own yogurt to be assured of bacteria content.</P>
<P>   Bad breath is usually a good indication that normal bacteria levels are low.  When lactobacillus levels are low in the colon, partially digested food decays, produce foul gas and toxemia. The prevalence of cold sores (herpes simplex), constipation, diarrhea, acne, vaginitis, headache, symptoms of hypoglycemia, yeast infections and others are often signs of low flora levels.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DAIRY & LACTOSE</H2>
<P>   Many people seem to be allergic to dairy products. The primary reason is quite often not that they are truly allergic to them but that they cannot deal with the lactose (commonly called milk sugar) contained in the dairy products. They cannot digest lactose, or milk sugar, and this can lead to allergies, headaches, cramps, mucous formation and many other health problems. The various kinds of Lactobacillus bacteria can digest it. This is why many people can eat yogurt, cultured milks and kefir even though they cannot handle dairy products like milk, cheese, ice cream, etc.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VIRUS AND YEAST</H2>
<P>   Cold sores, caused by the herpes simplex virus, are a reliable indicator that micro-flora is becoming lower than acceptable. Constipation and diarrhea can develop from decreased levels of friendly bacteria.
   It is believed that yeast infections, including thrush, vaginitis, and vaginal infections with abnormal amounts of discharge, are associated with decreased micro-flora levels.   Anyone with chronic infections should consider supplementing with lactobacillus as they support the immune system and help restore healthy ecology. People with toxemia and those going through any kind of detoxification program should supplement with SALIVAREX.</P>


<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> UNIQUE FORMULA</H2>
<P>  SALIVAREX contains the four most lactobacillus  for supplemental use.  The Acidophilus  and Bulgaricus strains quite often occur together in nature. Bifidus is an  extremely  beneficial  strain  and  usually  not contained in this type of supplement as it is expensive and difficult to produce. Bifidus is normally present in the digestive tracts of newborn babies.  While the babies are breast feeding it usually maintains its levels and can multiply. As they grow older and are exposed to whole milk and other foods, Lactobacillus Bifidus disappears.</P>
<P>   One special feature of  SALIVAREX is that it contains a large quantity of Lactobacillus Salivarius, a unique strain of highly specialized super micro-flora. This highly active organism neutralizes many pathogens which thrive in an unhealthy colon. It  has  the  ability  to  dramatically  increase  energy  levels  by breaking down undigested proteins making them available for use.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  SALIVAREX is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus Phytozyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit  of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE SALIVAREX</H2>
</P>   SALIVAREX capsules should be kept in the refrigerator. It is a good idea to take a bottle of SALIVAREX every three or four months for routine replenishing.   When low levels of lactobacillus are obvious, four capsules can be taken three to six times a day until one bottle is used to build up levels quickly. Then, one or two capsules twice a day. Many people supplement once or twice a day as an ongoing way to keep their levels of friendly bacteria up to par.  SALIVAREX capsules can also be opened and placed into baby formula or sprinkled on food.</P>
<P>   SALIVAREX is nutritionally helpful to maintain a healthy colon.  The Life Plus Products <A HREF="hecol.htm">ECOLOGY NO. 3</A>  and <A HREF="hcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> are compatible with SALIVAREX. ECOLOGY NO. 3 is a highly concentrated powder that contains large quantities of all four lactobacillus strains, but  SALIVAREX is more concentrated with L-Salivarius.</P>

  The lack of physical exercise, especially when combined with the lack of a nutritious diet is thought by most experts to be the biggest contributor to nervousness, anxiety and depression.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> EXERCISE</H2>
<P>   Exercise is our first line of defense against tension, anxiety and depression. Exercising increases circulation to all of the organs of the body.  Supplying them with more oxygen and nutrition helps the muscles relax. In addition, it lowers the build-up of metabolic end products and we feel better.  However, it is difficult for most people to stick with exercise programs.  It takes real dedication but does pay off over the long term.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DIET</H2>
<P>   Diet is one of the real culprits responsible for anxiety. Most people eat too much, and in addition, their diets do not contain the sufficient nutrients.  Our modern "convenience diets" are high in calories and low in vitamins and minerals. The B vitamins and the minerals, calcium and magnesium, are very important for the immune system, yet the diets of many people are deficient in these nutrients.</P>
<P>  The high consumption of sugar is probably the leading dietary contributor to nervousness and anxiety. Over a period of time this can lead to a condition known as hypoglycemia, which is very prevalent today. Hypoglycemia is a condition where our blood sugar levels get dangerously low at times.   This, too, contributes to nervousness, tension, restlessness and even depression.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> STIMULANTS</H2>
<P>  Quite often, people plagued with hypoglycemia, which is commonly expressed in tiredness and nervousness, resort to caffeine, nicotine, drugs, and sugar when they get the blues. However, these things merely aggravate the situation further, and so many get into a vicious cycle, usually without even knowing it.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> A NATURAL ALTERNATIVE</H2>
<P>   It is wise to eat a quality diet with adequate amounts of all the food groups. Make certain that your diet contains a good cross section of all the vitamins and minerals, especially the B vitamins, calcium and magnesium. You may consider supplementing with a well rounded foundational multiple product like <A HREF="htvm.htm">TVM-49</A> and <A HREF="hcalmag.htm">CAL MAG PLUS</A>. In addition, the Life Plus natural herbal blend TRANQUILON may fit your program as well. Thousands of people like it because it does not produce the side effects of drowsiness, tiredness, etc.</P>
<P>  The TRANQUILON formula contains ten natural herbs that work together for their synergistic effect including Valerian Root, Passionflower, Hops, Black Cohosh, Wood Betony, Chamomile, Lady's Slipper, Cayenne, Chlorophyll and Skullcap.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  TRANQUILON is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE TRANQUILON</H2>
<P>  Most people take one or two tablets, two to three times throughout the day, which is usually adequate. However, three tablets can be taken each time if desired. Some individuals take it at bedtime by itself, or with <A HREF="hmel.htm">SOMNISET</A>. Other Life Plus products synergistic with <A HREF="htranq.htm">TRANQUILON</A> are <A HREF="htvm.htm">TVM-49</A>, <A HREF="hcandy.htm">CANDY CAL</A>, <A HREF="hmag.htm"> MAGNESIUM PLUS</A>, <A HREF="hcalmag.htm">CALMAG PLUS</A>. <A HREF="hsupt.htm">SUPPORT TABS</A> and <A HREF="hmagicf.htm">INNER MAGIC F</A> for women and <A HREF="hmagicm.htm">INNER MAGIC M </A>for men.</P>

<H1>FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Ginkgo Biloba & Huperizia Serrata & Amino Acids & Co-Enzyme Q-10 </H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE BRAIN </H2>


<P>  Mankind has long been fascinated by that gray, wrinkled matter contained within our skulls. Just as the heart, liver or stomach has been thought of as the seat of the emotions in various cultures, so also the brain has been regarded as the seat of intelligence.</P>
<P>  What we eat can affect our moods, mental alertness and memory causing much interest and research in brain function related to special nutrients in recent years.</P>
<P>  The brain is a complicated, well organized matrix of intricate nerve endings connecting each brain cell with many others. Billions of electrical nerve impulses travel back and forth within the brain every second. Many chemicals act as neurotransmitters that transport these impulses from one cell to another. If the brain has an inadequate  supply  of the  nutrients  it  needs  to manufacture these substances, it will be hindered in its ability to function properly.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ALZHEIMER'S</H2>
<P>  Malfunctions of the brain seem to be an increasing problem in western societies today with Alzheimer's Disease being one of the most common and most serious. It is the fourth leading cause of death among adults with about 100,000 deaths annually.  It afflicts between 2.5 and 4 million Americans and it is predicted to rise to 14 million victims in the year 2040. At age 65, your chance of getting Alzheimer's is 6%, at 75 it is 20% and is an incredible 47% at age 85. The disease begins with early confusion and progresses to the point of major forgetfulness, incontinence, difficult sleeping and major personality changes. Then, just about all motor activity is lost to the point of not being able to even eat without help.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SPECIAL FORMULA</H2>
<P>  This unique herbal based product contains the special Hyperizia Serrata, Gota Kola and Ginkgo Biloba concentrate plus Ginseng herbs. In addition, it contains the very special valuable amino acids L-Glutamine, L-Taurine,  L-Tyrosine  plus  N-Acetyl  Carnitine. Go-Enzyme Q-10 is included because of its fantastic anti-oxidant effect. FOOD FOR THOUGHT provides the nutrients specifically synergistic for support of healthy brain function.  Many individuals find FOOD FOR THOUGHT helpful for alertness and stamina.</P>
<P>  The amino acids in FOOD FOR THOUGHT serve as precursors, which the brain needs to produce important neurotransmitter serotonin. If inadequate amounts of these types of amino acids are not in the diet, too little serotonin is produced causing you to become nervous or have trouble sleeping.</P>
<P>  L-Glutamine is an amino acid that penetrates the barrier separating the brain from the rest of the body's circulatory system. Once inside the brain, L-Glutamine has the unusual ability to provide fuel for brain cells. Consequently, it is an energy source for the brain and has been used to improve learning and I.Q. Some alcoholics have been helped dramatically by L-Glutamine supplements.  Even though the body manufactures its own Glutamine, some people seem to need more than they can produce by themselves and supplementation is needed.</P>
<P>  Tyrosine is a precursor to Norepinephrine and Dopamine (two important neurotransmitters) in the brain that are excitatory and seem to keep you alert, sexually interested and ambitious.   Dopamine is deficient in people with Parkinson's disease.  Results are now becoming apparent about the nutritional value of Tyrosine in the prevention of depression.</P>
<P>  FOOD FOR THOUGHT contains the special nutrients for those who desire to keep an alert mind and a sharp memory. Some of them have been well known in other cultures for centuries and some are just now becoming understood. This formula is great for students, absent-minded professors and the elderly. Many believe the herbs and other nutrients help to prevent feelings of being depressed and nutritionally supports those who want to stay alert without resorting to caffeine or other harmful stimulants.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  FOOD FOR THOUGHT is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<H1>LIFE-N-POWER: High Energy Lozenge with Vitamin B-12</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VITAMIN B-12</H2>

 <P> Experts agree that the essential nutrient Vitamin B-12 often increases energy and improves memory, appetite (when needed) and digestion. It is an absolute must for the maintenance of a healthy nervous system and is considered by many to play an important role as an anti-aging nutrient.</P>
<P>  Many of the functions of Vitamin B-12, such as building  blood  cells,  promoting  DNA  synthesis, naturally   interfering   with   inflammation   and strengthening the immune system are fundamental to a healthy body.</P>
<P>  Thousands of doctors have given Vitamin B-12 injections over the last several decades to help patients cope with stress, depression and exhaustion to name only a few.  It is true that some of its uses may not be "proven", but it is unlikely that its use would have been continued over the years if both doctors and their patients did not receive benefit from it. Vitamin B-12 has been used to help increase fertility in livestock for many years. A study actually demonstrated that Vitamin B-12 injections increased the sperm count in 27% of men participating that began the study with low levels.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUBLINGUAL</H2>
<P>  It is well known that the body has a difficult time absorbing Vitamin B-12 through the digestive tract. This is the  primary  reason that Vitamin  B-12  injections became  so  popular  in  the  doctor's  office. LIFE-N-POWER is a slow dissolving lozenge that releases its ingredients in the mouth so that they can be absorbed by the tiny sublingual capillaries.  The term "sublingual'' simply means "under the tongue."  The majority of the Vitamin B-12 and its metabolite, Dibencozide,  contained  in  LIFE-N-POWER  are absorbed this way, assuring much more reliable and consistent uptake in the body. The majority of the complex carbohydrate is also absorbed this way as well, providing more instant energy.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DIBENCOZIDE</H2>
<P>  Vitamin B-12, also known an Cobalamine or Cyanocobalamine, plays an important role in nucleic acid and protein synthesis as well as in nitrogen retention, cell division and growth. Target tissues include the central nervous system and skeletal muscle. The primary active form of Vitamin B-12 in the body is a coenzyme commonly called Dibencozide. The body stores the major portion of it vitamin B-12 in the form of Dibencozide and the Dibencozide form is retained in the body by as much as three times better.</P>

<P>  Dibencozide is directly involved in the body's building of muscle tissue. Many doctors specializing in sports  medicine  recommend  Dibencozide  as  a non-hormonal anabolic agent that is natural and effective in helping build strong muscles. It certainly offers the athlete a safe and effective alternative to steroid hormones and is not banned by the international sports community.</P>
<P.  As the metabolically active form of Vitamin B-12. Dibencozide supports protein synthesis, especially in the liver. As such, it has been recommended for individuals of all ages, especially in children and older individuals.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENERGY</H2>
<P>  Our bodies rely on carbohydrates for its primary fuel for energy.  Many people routinely experience drastic changes in blood sugar levels. The continual ingestion of simple carbohydrate (sugars) sensitize the pancreas to over produce insulin which results in low blood sugar levels. This  process  continues  with  time  until hypoglycemia and/or diabetes develops. However, the pancreas is able to handle more complex carbohydrates as they break down to their more simple components and do not create such a demand on the pancreas. LIFE-N-POWER contains complex carbohydrates that can easily and quickly be utilized by the body for energy, yet it does it safely, without the dangers of simple carbohydrate or sugars.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  LIFE-N-POWER is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE LIFE-N-POWER</H2>
 <P> As an energy boosting supplement, LIFE-N-POWER lozenges are simply dissolved slowly in the mouth whenever they are needed. They are useful as a "picker upper'' when dieting, working late, driving at night, or just for the afternoon "blahs." When used to help build muscle, it is best to make sure you take at least three tablets per day. Use them at workout times for energy and increased stamina. LIFE-N-POWER is helpful in maintaining blood sugar levels and each tablet only contains about two calories so they can be used by people wanting to lose weight, too.</P>

<H1>OXY-GEN CAPS: Stabilized Anaerocidal Atomic Oxygen</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MOST ABUNDANT ELEMENT </H2>

<P>   The earth is composed of over 100 elements and the most abundant of all of them is oxygen. Oxygen is absolutely essential for the existence of all living matter. We can go for weeks without food and days without water but we cannot live over four minutes without oxygen. There is no other substance on earth that we are so dependent on for our existence. In addition, all living matter contains oxygen, which is combined with other elements, not only as water in all cellular and circulatory fluids, but also as a component of all organic compounds such as carbohydrates (sugars, starches, cellulose, fiber), glycogen, fats and proteins.   Even the clay and rock structures of our soils are loaded with oxygen-containing compounds in the forms of oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, sulfates and others.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW DO WE GET IT?</H2>
P>   We mostly think of the oxygen in the air we breathe, but it is everywhere.  However, it is a major component in the water we drink and an ingredient of tens of thousands of different molecules that make up our foods. We breathe it, drink it and consume it in our food. Today, we can even supplement with it.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE KINDS OF OXYGEN</H2>
<P>   In its simplest form, oxygen is an atom that exists as one atom all by itself and is referred to just as "O" (singlet oxygen). The most well known and most common form of oxygen is when two atoms of oxygen combine to make molecular oxygen known as 02.</P>
<P>   Many attempts have been made by medical researchers to provide oxygen to the tissues of the body.   Hyperbaric chambers have been developed to put oxygen under pressure, forcing it into the tissues and blood stream.  Ozone is a very reactive form of oxygen that contains three atoms of oxygen and is symbolized by 03. Hydrogen peroxide has been given extensively, both orally and intravenously.</P>
<P>   However, magnesium peroxide is the form of choice today. The magnesium peroxide in Life Plus OXY-GEN CAPS is more stable than regular hydrogen peroxide and when it is utilized in the body it also provides the beneficial mineral, magnesium. Magnesium peroxide is also easier to handle and can be encapsulated in the dry form.  Life Plus OXY-GEN CAPS are an excellent method of supplementing the body with the quality oxygen needed for optimum health for energy, fighting infections and detoxifying.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FREE RADICAL FLAP</H2>
<P>   A commonly misunderstood aspect of hydrogen peroxide is that it is a free radical. This is simply not true. By definition, a free radical has an unpaired electron.  They are very short lived, usually only one ten-thousandth of a second.   If left unchecked, they can cause damage, but they also provide a much needed function in the body as well.  Therefore, balance is always the key. When hydrogen peroxide enters the blood stream, catalase enzyme immediately breaks it down into water and atomic or singlet oxygen. As mentioned above, this singlet oxygen does not exist long enough in the body to harm cells.  As a matter of fact, hydrogen peroxide is formed in the special white blood cells known as macrophages. They have a special enzyme called peroxisome, which produces hydrogen peroxide.  The singlet oxygen they produce literally kills invading bacteria as the singlet oxygen stimulates the oxidation-reduction cycle, which includes detoxification functions in the body as well as the destruction of anaerobic pathogens.</P>
<P>   Environmental contaminates in the air are not only harmful to every cell of our body, but also replaces the amount of oxygen percentage we breathe.  This can result in various problems such as a sense of fatigue, the inability to concentrate, repair of damaged cells and the inability to fight off infection and degenerative diseases, such as cancer and heart disease, the leading causes of death today.   Many researchers believe that the increased discomfort experienced by those suffering from arthritis before a storm or in more humid climates may result from a reduced amount of oxygen in the air.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> OXYGEN DEPLETION</H2>
 <P>  Several factors contribute to oxygen depletion. One of the most overlooked factors that may be contributing to the increased incidence of degenerative disease is the reduction of oxygen content of the air we breathe from about 35% to 19%. This is about a 50% reduction of the oxygen in the air around us.  Mineral deficiencies are another factor.  Minerals help inhibit the formation of toxins in our soils and the lack of minerals throws an extra burden on oxygen.  In addition, overeating can cause oxygen deficiency as more oxygen is required to complete the digestive process and additional metabolic waste.   Improper breathing contributes to the oxygen debt.  All infections reduce oxygen reserves, and researchers have shown that fluoride in our drinking water slows down the process of oxidation of our foods.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENERGY</H2>
<P>   Probably the most recognized result of decreased quality oxygen uptake in the body is the lack of energy and, on the other hand, increased energy levels are common place with higher levels. Even though the oxygen saturation in the veins of modern man is only 60-70%, some experts see a need for supplementing oxygen to supply up to the 80% range.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FORMULATION</H2>
<P>  Life Plus OXY-GEN CAPS are based on original research and formulation of Dr. Kurt W Donsbach, D.C., N.D., Ph.D. His famous oxygen-saturated aloe vera based formula is meticulously manufactured with cold processed aloe vera used as a stabilized carrier for numerous nutritional constituents, including magnesium peroxide and pure anaerocidal oxygen. Each OXY-GEN capsule contains singlet oxygen equivalent to twelve drops of 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide derived from magnesium peroxide and pure anaerocidal oxygen. It is formulated in a proprietary blend of herbs and herbal extracts of Ginkgo Biloba, Ginseng, Suma, Mint Tea, Bee Pollen, Citrus Pectin and Myrr.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUGGESTED USE</H2>
<P>  OXY-GEN CAPS are packaged in bottles of 64 capsules and are recommended to be taken two capsules at one time with water from one to three times per day as desired.  It is recommended that they be taken between meals away from food, at least one-half hour before meals or two hours after. This is simply to help provide for the most efficient absorption. Children usually take one capsule per day for each forty pounds of body weight.</P>

<H1>CORRECTED SALT: Pleasant Tasting Balanced Condiment Containing Magnesium </H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PLAQUE </H2>
<P>Hardening of the arteries is caused by a build-up of "plaque," a deposit made up of fats, cholesterols, proteins, minerals, especially calcium, toxins and heavy metals. Plaque reduces the size of the arteries, making it more difficult for the blood to flow through them properly. It reduces their elasticity. High blood pressure can result, and therefore the heart must work harder to pump our blood. Eventually, the heart wears out and serious health problems arise. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the Western World.</P>
<P>  Laboratory tests have shown that both table salt and regular salt substitutes contribute heavily to the build-up of plaque in the arteries.  Regular table salt contains sodium chloride and as many as forty other ingredients such as acids, sugar, silicates for flowing characteristics and others. Commercial salt substitutes usually contain potassium chloride plus the same additional ingredients contained in table salt. Both sodium chloride (when its effect is not offset with magnesium) and potassium chloride are strongly anabolic substances and their continued use can contribute heavily to the build-up of plaque in the blood vessels.  When people develop arterial plaque or when high blood pressure develops, the first thing their doctors tell them is to cut down their salt intake.</P>
<P> CORRECTED SALT is one of the most revolutionary  nutritional products ever developed.  Some of the negative effects of both sodium and chloride are balanced by a unique formula of magnesium and sulfur.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW CORRECTED SALT WORKS</H2>

<P> There are two  general  classifications  of normal chemical reactions in the body: (1)Anabolic, which are constructive and "build-up"; and (2) Catabolic, which break substances down. Research has proven that our metabolism shifts, or cycles back and forth, from anabolic to catabolic, depending on which type of reactions may be dominant in the body at that time.  To maintain optimum health, our metabolism should cycle back and forth daily. If it doesn't, certain conditions are more likely to develop if we are "stuck" in an anabolic mode, yet others are more likely to develop if we are catabolic most of the time.
 According to theory, the depositing of plaque in the arteries is an anabolic process, because it is characterized by a "build-up". It so happens that both sodium and chloride (the ingredients in table salt) are strongly anabolic and stimulate anabolic processes in the body. The same is true of potassium. Therefore, potassium chloride (the most common salt substitute) can be just as damaging.</P>
<P>  CORRECTED SALT contains a predetermined balance of both anabolic and catabolic minerals.  The anabolic  nutrients,  sodium  and  chloride  in CORRECTED SALT are balanced by the catabolic minerals, magnesium and sulfur. CORRECTED SALT also contains trace elements from natural sea salt.  It tastes like salt, because it contains salt; but instead of being heavily anabolic, it is balanced because of its formulation. You get the same great flavor of regular table salt but you don't have to be concerned about the bad effects of regular salt.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P> CORRECTED SALT is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus Phytozyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.  Other salt products contain numerous other ingredients, but CORRECTED SALT is 100% pure with only the PhytoZyme base added.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE CORRECTED SALT</H2>
<P>  CORRECTED SALT is intended to be used as you would normally use table salt. Simply throw out all your regular salt and fill your salt shakers with CORRECTED SALT. Use it in cooking or baking. It does not contain any preservatives, acids, starches or flowing agents. It has a tendency to "cake up" in high humidity after it has been opened. Therefore, it is recommended that you place it in a dry place. If it does cake up, simply place it in the oven (not the microwave) for a while to drive off the moisture. Then, simply break the clusters apart so it will flow through your salt shaker.</P>

<BR><BR><BR>
<H3>10 Shakes from an average salt shaker equals approximately 1 gram of CORRECTED SALT and contains:</H3>
<TABLE BORDER=10>
<tr>
<td>Sodium 14.7 milliequivalents</td>
<td>Chloride 14.8 milliequivalents</td>

<tr>
<td>Sulfur 0.16 milliequivalents</td>

<td colspan=2>Pure Sodium Chloride and Elemental Magnesium as PolyMagPlex<sup>TM</sup> which is a proprietary blend of high quality magnesium sources including magnesium citrate, aspartate gluconate and glyerophosphate plus Sulfur and Sea Salt for trace amounts of other minerals.</td>
</tr>
</TABLE>
<P>Suggested Use: Use freely as a condiment a the table or in cooking and baking as you would regular table salt.</P>

<H1>ALKO-MAR: Immune Supporting Concentrated Alkoxyglycerols</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2>HISTORY</H2>
 <P>  Interest grew for researchers to study alkoxyglycerols because Scandinavian fisherman in the northern waters used to apply the oil from shark livers to cuts and other wounds while at sea because they healed quickly. They also began taking it internally when they were not feeling well.  Over a period of years, researchers have learned that the alkoxyglycerols in shark liver oil provided a fantastic immune supporting nutritional  effect.   It has  been  learned that when  larger quantities of it are used internally, care must be exercised to make  certain  that  the  levels  of  the  oil  soluble vitamins A and D are not concentrated in the final product. The concentrates used in the manufacturing of ALKO-MAR are of the highest quality and can be relied on to not contain significant amounts of these vitamins.</P>
<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMMUNE SYSTEM </H2>

<P>  The immune system is a complex network of various defenses against harmful microorganisms of bacterial nature and other foreign substances that try to invade and affect the body in a negative way. It protects against such offenders as fungi and viruses and is also protective against aging along with other health providing factors. It is the immune systems job to neutralize and destroy any invading organism that could cause harm, either by infecting body tissues or by releasing poisons or toxins.</P>
<P>  The immune systems principal method of functioning is through its white blood cells. They are manufactured by the billions, primarily in bone marrow.  Unlike red blood cells, white cells can move on their own and are able to pass through the cell walls, allowing them to move rapidly to the site of infection or injury. There is basically two different types of them. They consist of the leukocytes that live in and travel through the blood stream and the lymphocytes which are found in the lymphoid tissue of the spleen, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow. There are two basic types of them, the B-lymphocytes and the T-lymphocytes. In general the T-lymphocytes are the most involved in fighting infections and diseases in the body.</P>
<P>   A primary benefit of the Alkoxyglycerols contained in ALKO-MAR is that they provide special nutrients that naturally support the body's immune system's ability to fight infections and degeneration.</P>
<P>  Lymphocytes destroy invaders by several methods including:  I)releasing antibodies that attach to the surface of invading proteins (called antigens) to neutralize them or make them easier to devour by the large scavenging cells known as macrophages, 2) ingesting them, or 3) releasing or causing surrounding cells to release enzymes or chemical agents such as histamines.</P>
<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMMUNE MEMORY </H2>


<P>   One of the remarkable aspects of the immune system is its ability to recognize past invaders, allowing it to respond to a second attack quickly.  Disease causing viruses and bacteria
invade and reproduce rapidly, so this ability is extremely important.   After its first exposure to an antigen. certain lymphocytes become memory cells, which keep a blueprint of the invader. This is how immunizations work.  By exposing the immune system to small or non-active amounts of disease causing antigens, the immune system remembers how to respond at a later date and protects us if we are exposed at a later date.</P>
<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> OTHERS </H2>

<P>  The immune system is equally involved in many other protective processes in the body such as its response to allergy producing substances, controlling the rate and aspects of aging, protection from free radicals and protection against degenerative diseases such as arthritis, cancer, arteriosclerosis and others. Probably the most well understood and studied is allergies and cancer.  Nutritionally supporting the immune system with natural substances like alkoxyglycerols has much more value then just helping the body fight off infections.</P>
<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SOME DISORDERS </H2>

<P>   Many conditions associated with the malfunctioning of the immune system are much more well known today than ever before. AIDS, more completely known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, cancer, auto-immune disorders and allergic reactions. The primary problem with AIDS is that the immune system becomes so inefficient that the body becomes at an extreme risk to just about all other possible attacks including infections of all kinds.   Having one of these problems is indicative that the immune system is not working up to par.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ANTIOXIDANTS </H2> 
<P>   The immune system is extremely sensitive to the need of antioxidant nutrients. Actually, it is the most sensitive system or organ in the body to their need. The immune status of any individual is a good indication of the status or need for antioxidants in their diet. The immune system is very sensitive to free radicals and cannot handle their attack as well as other functioning systems in the body. Supplementing with immune system supporting nutrients like ALKO-MAR is very synergistic with supplementing with other Life Plus immune supporting, antioxidant products such as <A HREF="hprotx.htm">PROTX II</A>,<A HREF="coq10.htm"> CO-Q-10 PLUS</A>,<A HREF="cardio.htm"> CARDIO-CHELEX </A> and <A HREF="opc.htm"> PROANTHENOLS.</A></P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE ALKO-MAR </H2> 
<P>  No specific number of ALKO-MAR capsules have been determined to take routinely. From one to three capsules are within the range.  It is a totally natural substance and larger amounts can be taken when needed. Taking more than twelve capsules (four capsules three times a day) is not productive. It is usually recommended to take between two and twelve capsules per day depending on the need.</P>

<BR><BR><BR>
<H1>COMBAT: Immune Supporting Nutrients </H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMMUNE SYSTEM SUPPORT </H2>

<P>  COMBAT contains various concentrated tissue nutrients obtained from bovine tissues which  contain natural, proportionate amounts needed by the tissues of our immune system. They are very synergistic with the other nutrients in COMBAT.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE STRATEGY BEHIND COMBAT</H2>
<P>  The Thymus gland plays a major role in the action of the immune system.  The Thymus both produces and activates T-cells, or T-Lymphocytes, which travel through the lymphatic system, destroying bacteria and some larger viruses when we are invaded. Quite often people get swollen lymph nodes when infection is present in the body due to this activity.</P>
<P>  The Adrenal glands play an important role in the stress that we are exposed to, including colds, flu and other kinds of infections. The Spleen is also involved in the protective mechanisms maintained by the body. The Life  Plus  formulation  in  COMBAT  contains concentrated tissue nutrients from Thymus, Adrenal and Spleen to supply many of the micronutrients they need to function efficiently.</P>
<P>  COMBAT also contains substantial amounts of both Vitamin A in the form of regular natural Vitamin A and its precursor, Beta-Carotene. Vitamin A helps to maintain the integrity of the mucous membranes that are a part of the linings of the sinuses, lungs and other parts of the respiratory system. It is important to maintain them as they are the first line of the body's defense against air born infections that attack through the respiratory system.</P>
<P>  During   allergy   attacks   or  colds,   these tissues often become irritated and secrete more than normal amounts of mucous and fluid. Actually, mucous secretion is the way the body protects itself by "washing away" contaminants.  This fluid contains significant amounts of the lysozyme enzyme that kills harmful bacteria.  Since people generally find this condition of excess mucous production undesirable, they often take antihistamine drugs to counteract the mucous secretion. Usually, these drugs dry up the mucous too much, prevent the body from protecting itself and actually slow down the healing process.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VITAMIN C</H2>
<P>   Vitamin C is thought to be a natural antihistamine that does not have the side effects of many synthetic drugs. Vitamin C also helps the white blood cells fight bacteria. Like vitamin A, it is a natural antioxidant which ensures that oxygen is available to the cells for metabolism and fighting infection. It is thought by many researchers that vitamin C can prevent certain viruses from multiplying.</P>
<P>  COMBAT contains Propolis, nature's own antibiotic. It is obtained from beehives and is a product that honey bees produce to protect the hive from infectious invaders. They wall off the area with Propolis as it is well known that infectious bacteria cannot penetrate it.  COMBAT also contains Bee Pollen, which has the reputation of supporting the immune system.</P>
<P>  In addition, COMBAT contains Garlic and Cayenne herbs, which have been used for centuries to fight infection naturally and to detoxify the body.  Pleurisy Root, Echinacea and Yarrow are other herbs included in COMBAT for their abilities to support the immune and respiratory systems.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  COMBAT is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty  natural  concentrates  of numerous  valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE COMBAT</H2>
<P>  There are no set amounts of COMBAT to take but it is recommended to take several tablets the first day or two when early signs are noticed. Usually, two to four tablets every hour for the first day and decrease from there.</P>

 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HERBALS </H2>

<P>   Herbs have been used since creation to provide for the health and well being of entire civilizations. The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage.  Mainstream modern technology is now beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies. This is usually referred to in the literature today as phytotherapy. We probably will never understand many of the secrets regarding the way in which many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason not to take advantage of their benefits.</P>
<P>  To our knowledge, Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kinds of herbal-based products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific nutritional goals.  These other synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and, at times, concentrated tissue nutrients. By combining modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal-based products are second-to-none anywhere in the world.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DETOXIFICATION</H2>
<P>   The two primary organs of metabolic detoxification in the body are the liver and the kidneys. The liver filters pollutants out of the blood and dumps many of them into the digestive tract by secreting them through the bile.  One problem is that many of the toxins are reabsorbed in the intestinal tract back into our system.</P>
<P>  PARATOX contains two amino acids, Methionine and Cysteine.  These wonderful natural substances are not only essential to life and an important component of the proteins in our bodies,  they also support proper liver function and cleanse the body. They contain a sulfhydryl grouping in their molecules,  which  contain  sulfur  having  a  chelating capacity that binds toxins and helps the body eliminate them.</P>
<P>   Also included with the amino acids is Alginate, an herbal extract  obtained  from  seaweed.    As  the  Alginate contained in PARATOX is swallowed and passes through the digestive tract, it naturally binds with toxic metals like aluminum, strontium, tin, cadmium, mercury and lead that are often secreted into the digestive tract through the bile. Then, since our bodies cannot absorb Alginate (particularly when it is complexed with the heavy metals) into the body, it passes through and is excreted, taking the heavy metals with it.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PARASITES</H2>
<P>  Many people often find it amusing when they hear they may have worms or other parasites.   Yet this problem is very prevalent all over the world. We routinely worm our horses, cattle, dogs, cats and other animals but few think to care for themselves in the same manner.</P>
<P>   A parasite, by definition, lives off of other living things. The parasites that infest our bodies not only live off the nutrients in the foods we eat but they actually live off our tissues.   They  secrete  toxins  into our bloodstream that circulate  and  often  cause  damage. One  factor  not normally considered is that they are a constant drain on our immune systems.</P>
<P>  Parasites can be obtained from the leaves of certain vegetables, from the stools of pets, such as dogs and cats, horses, cows and other farm livestock and from meat that hasn't been cooked adequately to kill them off.  It has been shown that it is impossible to kill some of the parasites in pork by cooking.  Many water supplies in countries around the world are definite sources of parasites, so those who travel should definitely take precaution.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TWELVE SPECIAL HERBS</H2>
<P>   A substance taken to expel or control parasites (most often referred  to  as  "worms")  is  technically  called  a "vermifuge." The unique combination of the twelve special herbs in PARATOX are great as a natural supplement. They include Black Walnut, Wormwood, Garlic, Parsley, Fenugreek, Alginate,  Goldenseal,  Norwegian  Kelp,  Cayenne  and Chlorophyll.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  PARATOX is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit  of receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE PARATOX</H2>
 <P>  In most cases, Paratox does not need to be taken daily on an on-going basis. It is usually recommended to take a round of PARATOX once a quarter (every three months).  The regimen is to take one or two bottles each cleansing. The first time you take PARATOX, take two bottles and then one bottle is usually adequate for repeat usages.</P>
<P>   On day one, take one tablet three times a day. On day two, take two tablets three times a day. On day three, take three tablets three times a day. On day four, take four tablets three times a day. Stay at this level until one or two bottles are used. Some individuals may develop a feeling of the "blahs" as the toxins are coming out of their body. If this happens to you, just decrease the dosage.  This feeling should subside as your system is cleansed. If you travel to other countries, it is a good idea to take one or two tablets three times a day, using a full bottle, while you travel.</P>
<P>   It is strongly recommended that you drink plenty of fluids while taking PARATOX to help your body eliminate toxins. Good pure water is best, but some fruit or vegetable juice is acceptable as well. Avoid alcohol, milk and soft drinks during this time.</P>

<H1>PROSTATE FORMULA: Herbs and Other Nutrients for Prostate</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGE </H2>
<P>Younger men are more likely to be affected than most people realize. Pre-cancerous lesions have been found in men who have died in accidents as young as 20 years of age. Over 25% of the men autopsied who have died in their 30's were found to be affected and over 55% of them in their 40's.</P>
<P>  Even though prostate cancer is slow growing, it is always better to have an early diagnosis.
   It is surprising that less than half of the men over the age of 40 have ever had the traditional digital exam that is recommended by both general practitioners and urologists. The lack of early diagnosis is one reason why as many as 60% of the cases that are diagnosed have already spread. The newer PSA Test (prostate specific antigen test) is a blood test that result in more cases being diagnosed sooner.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THREE CATEGORIES</H2>
  <P>The prevalence of this condition is not well known. As a matter of fact, a survey has revealed that as many as 11% of American men were unaware that they even had a prostate gland.   Needless to say, the symptoms of prostate trouble are even  less well  known.   The conditions are usually categorized into one of three; 1) prostatitis (inflamed prostate), 2) benign prostatic hypertrophy (BHP), and 3) prostate cancer. Prostatitis is usually a result of an infection but quite often is thought to be caused by stress. Infections are usually treated with antibiotics  or  other  anti-infectives,  while  cases associated with stress are usually treated with muscle relaxants or exercise.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BHP</H2>
<P>  In cases of BHP, the gland may grow many times its normal size, say from the size of a walnut, possibly in a young man in his 20's or early 30's, to as large as an orange or grapefruit in his 50's. Most researchers agree that this growth, at least in part, is associated with the male hormone testosterone or its metabolites. Although not malignant, BHP can be very uncomfortable as over growth of the prostate usually causes physical blockage of the urethra.  This results in urinary tract problems because the urethra, which carries urine from the bladder, travels through the middle of the prostate and can become blocked by the overgrowth of prostate tissue.  Also, bladder and kidney infections, as well as increased frequency of urination and discomfort, can result.</P>

<P>  Several different surgical techniques have been developed that remove all or some of the prostate tissue when used in the treatment of BHP and prostate cancer. Even though they can be life prolonging and go a long way to relieve pain and discomfort, they are not without their side effects and limitations.   More recently, the importance of diet and exercise has come to light.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HIGH FAT DIETS</H2>
<P>  High fat diets have been linked to both BHP and prostate cancer. Autopsies have shown that cases of BHP have greatly increased the amount of cholesterol in their prostate tissues. It has also been shown that increasing body weight increases the incidence of prostate cancer. Moderately overweight men have more than double the risk, while those truly obese are four times more likely to develop the disease. Other studies have shown that men with prostate cancer consume more meat and dairy products. The incidence of prostate cancer goes up with decreased Vitamin A consumption and with increased exposure to Cadmium.</P>
<P>   Reduced activity and lack of exercise are also culprits in this whole scenario.  The Missouri Cancer Registry found that by studying 17,000 men with occupations that required a lot of physical activity had a lower incidence of prostate cancer.  In another study involving 18,000 men who burned 4,000 calories or more by weekly exercising reduced their risk of prostate cancer by up to over 85% when compared to men who used less than 1,000 calories by exercising per week.</P>

<H1>EYE FORMULA: Eyebright Herb and Other Nutrients for the Eyes</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HERBS </H2>

<P>   Herbs have been used since creation to provide for our health and well being, for entire civilizations for that matter.  The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage. Main stream modern technology is now finally beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies. This is usually referred to in the literature today as phytotherapy. We probably never will understand many of the secrets regarding how many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason to not take advantage of their benefits now.</P>
<P>  To our knowledge, Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kinds of herbal based products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific nutritional goals. These other synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and concentrated tissue nutrients  in  select  products.  By  combining  modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal based products are second to none anywhere in the world.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NUTRITION FOR THE EYES</H2>
<P>  Life  Plus  EYE  FORMULA  is  formulated  to nutritionally support the tissues of the eyes and other tissues.  Every year millions of people lose their sight to conditions such as macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts and retinal hemorrhages.</P>
<P>  Few people stop to think how our eyes are bombarded each day by air pollution, chemicals, drugs, certain cosmetics, fumes from solvents and cigarette smoke. Thus, it is imperative that we support our eyes nutritionally, if we want to use them for a whole lifetime.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NIGHT BLINDNESS AND VITAMIN A</H2>
<P>  One of the most common vision problems people have today is night blindness.  Vitamin A is actually a cure for this condition. EYE FORMULA contains 500 international units of Vitamin A in its natural precursor form, Beta-Carotene.  Ideally, more should be taken for this specific application, but only 500 international units are included in EYE FORMULA to not over supplement for individuals who are obtaining it from other supplements. However, the representative amount in EYE FORMULA ensures that it is present and available to the eyes when the other nutrients in this great product are present to provide its synergistic effect.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CIRCULATION AND EYES</H2>
<P>  Most eye problems associated with degeneration are related to circulation impairment in some way.   The decrease in blood supply is responsible for a lack of both oxygen and needed nutrients reaching our tissues.  In addition, end products of metabolism can build up and result in toxemia.   This  situation can be especially damaging to the eyes as oxygen levels are very critical to their delicate tissues. It has been shown, for instance, that decreased levels of Glutathione in the ocular tissues are associated with the existence of cataracts.</P>
<P>  The Eyebright herb in Life Plus EYE FORMULA is a very important ingredient and has been used as a valuable nutritional supplement for years, especially in Europe.  It has not only been taken whole, but made into tinctures, fluid extracts and even poultices that were applied topically.</P>
<P>  Bioflavonoids are compounds that occur in nature with Vitamin C. The Rutin and Hesperidin contained in Life Plus EYE FORMULA are known to  help maintain the integrity of the thousands of tiny blood vessels, called capillaries, in the eye. These two specific bioflavonoids are known to be especially beneficial for the eyes.</P>
<P>   Macular degeneration is a condition of the eyes that is characterized by a gradual decreased ability to see. Eyebright herb and Vitamin A combined with improved circulation can be very helpful.  Eyebright herb and the natural tri-peptide, Glutathione, is a unique synergistic nutritional  supportive  combination  for  the  eyes. Glutathione is a special natural substance that is present in all  normal  cells, especially ocular tissue that contain sulfur.   It is a great anti-oxidant and detoxifier and is thought to be helpful in the prevention of cataracts. Concentrated tissue nutrients from bovine ophthalmic and brain tissues are also included for their overall synergistic effects in the nutritional support for the healthy metabolic processes of eye tissue.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  EYE FORMULA is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE EYE FORMULA</H2>
<P>  It is usually recommended that you take one or two tablets three times a day as a natural nutritional supplement for the eyes. For optimum results, take Life Plus   EYE   FORMULA   with  <A HREF="hsoma.htm"> SOMAZYME</A>, <A HREF="hopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS</A> and additional vitamin A and C (usually from <A HREF="hcardio.htm">CARDIO CHELEX</A> ).</P>

<H1>PANCREAS FORMULA: Herbs , Enzymes & Other Nutrients for the Pancreas</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> UNIQUE FORMULA </H2>

<P>  Life Plus PANCREAS FORMULA is specifically formulated to nutritionally support the pancreas in a unique way. PANCREAS FORMULA contains herbs, enzymes, vitamins, minerals and concentrated tissue nutrients for their synergistic nutritional effect in support of proper pancreas function.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE PANCREAS & DIGESTION</H2>
<P>  The pancreas is one of the most important organs in our bodies. We can't live without it. It performs many functions that are important and are interrelated with the activities of many other organs of the endocrine system. In general, the pancreas has two major functions (1) enzyme production for digestion, and (2) insulin production  for  the  regulation  of  carbohydrate metabolism.</P>
<P>  In order to digest the food we eat, the pancreas produces  numerous  enzymes. They  include various  proteolytic  enzymes  such  as  trypsin, chymotrypsin and others that break down proteins. It also secretes lipases, which break down fats and amylases which break down complex carbohydrates in the form of starches and other large carbohydrate molecules.</P>
<P>  It used  to be thought that all of these  digestive enzymes were used up or excreted. We know now that many of them are reabsorbed into the bloodstream, where they are carried throughout the body for other purposes, such as the digestion of blood clots and foreign fats and proteins in the blood. For instance, trypsin and chymotrypsin keep the proteolytic activity in the blood to a healthy level and maintain a proper balance in the breaking down of fibrin in blood clots and other areas in the circulatory system.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE PANCREAS & INSULIN</H2>
 <P>  The special cells in the pancreas, called the Islets of Langerhans, produce insulin and secrete it into the blood stream. Insulin is the primary regulator of carbohydrate metabolism in the body.   When we eat simple carbohydrates (sugars) they are absorbed directly into the blood stream relatively quickly. When we eat complex carbohydrates (starches and others), it is digested (broken down) into its component smaller units and eventually into glucose which is then absorbed into the bloodstream. The pancreas senses the level of glucose in the blood and produces insulin accordingly. Insulin then helps the glucose enter the cells, where it is used for energy production. If too much insulin is produced, not enough glucose remains in the blood and if too little is produced, too much glucose remains in the blood and not enough enters the cells.</P>
<P>   If the pancreas is overworked and does not receive the nutrients it needs to maintain its own healthy metabolic processes, it can become exhausted and not produce enough insulin. The result can be diabetes. If, on the other hand, too much insulin is produced, the blood sugar level will be too low. This condition is called hypoglycemia.  Therefore, maintaining the proper balance is important.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT PANCREAS FORMULA DOES</H2>
<P>  PANCREAS FORMULA provides nutrients that the pancreas needs to function properly. It contains Zinc, which is needed in the manufacture of insulin and copper to help maintain proper zinc levels. It contains Chromium, which is essential to the action of insulin at the cell level. Since the pancreas is made of epithelial tissue, it needs vitamin A to remain healthy. Because the (duodenum) and liver work so closely with the pancreas, concentrated tissue nutrients from them and from bovine pancreas are included as well. In addition, two highly active enzyme concentrates from pancreas, pancreatin and (pancrelipase) are important ingredients in Life Plus PANCREAS FORMULA.  They supplement with enzymes which makes it possible for the pancreas gland to rest from the demand placed on it.</P>
 <P> The three valuable synergistic herbs, Dandelion, Goldenseal and Chickweed are also included for their synergistic effects.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  Life Plus PANCREAS FORMULA is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE PANCREAS FORMULA </H2>
<P>Take one or two tablets three times per day. It is a good idea for those with sugar metabolism difficulties to take before or between meals as nutritional support for the pancreas.   It can be taken at mealtime for the digestive  value  of the  enzymes  in  PANCREAS FORMULA. The Life Plus products <A HREF="hsoma.htm">SOMAZYME</A>,<A HREF="hsupt.htm"> SUPPORT  TABS</A>  and  <A HREF= "hopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS</A> are great synergistic products to take with PANCREAS FORMULA.</P>

<H1>EPA PLUS: Fish Oil Concentrate Omega-3 Polyunsaturates </H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> EPA PLUS </H2>


<P>  According to studies published in the well respected British scientific journal, Lancet, the incidence of heart disease related to atherosclerosis, including coronary artery disease, in Greenlandic Eskimos is extremely low. From 1963 to 1967 only three cases of these diseases were reported in the entire Eskimo population of Greenland.  Moreover, not a single established case of diabetes is known to have been reported in the population of the Greenlandic Uhanak district. Since diabetes and heart disease affected literally millions of Americans in the  1980's and  1990's, the lack of heart disease in Eskimos and other societies has attracted the serious attention of many scientists around the world.</P>
<P>  The   food   of  the   Greenlandic   Eskimos consists largely of meat from whales, seals, sea birds and fish (usually halibut and salmon).  Needless to say, their food is extremely rich in protein and fat and low in carbohydrates, but it is extremely high in the Omega-3 Polyunsaturates EPA and DHA as contained in Life Plus EPA PLUS.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> EPA</H2>
<P>   Doctors have been saying for years that large amounts of fat in the diet can lead to heart disease and other disorders.  Why, therefore, can a group of people who consume such large amounts of protein and fat have such low incidence of atherosclerotic heart disease?  Until recently, scientists have been baffled by this important question. The new link in their chain of understanding now centers around a marine lipid concentrate, containing Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA).</P>
<P>  EPA is a direct source of an important substance called prostaglandin F3. Prostaglandin E3 is directly responsible for making blood platelets (cells which form a "plug" wherever an injury occurs) less sticky, thus leading to an easier flow of blood throughout out- bodies.  This natural antithrombotic "anti-clotting" effect of` EPA has been well researched. This means that EPA is intimately involved in bodily processes that inhibit  blood  clots  (obstructions  to  circulation), particularly in the small capillaries of the heart. When a small blood vessel is injured, platelets adhere to each other around the edges of the injury, forming a clot. This is a natural protective mechanism that prevents us from literally bleeding to death.</P>
<P>  However, when platelets in the blood become too sticky,  they  can  clump  abnormally  fast  and  too frequently.  This rapid and extensive platelet clumping can actually inhibit circulation and be a major contributor to heart and circulatory disease.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DHA</H2>
<P>  Of almost equal importance, but not as widely researched, is Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA).   It comprises a significant amount of the tissue, which makes up our brains as well as a large part of the retina of the eye.</P>
<P>  The average American diet is very low in fresh fish and derivatives of sea food that contain EPA and DHA. On the other hand, it is high in refined carbohydrates and saturated fats.  This kind of diet can lead to a serious deficiency in the raw materials necessary for proper platelet function in our blood stream.  Recent dietary studies suggest that marine lipid complexes that contain EPA and DHA can have a very significant effect on lowering unwanted "blood fats." They may prove to be extremely useful natural substances powerful enough to normalize the high cholesterol and triglyceride levels that are so extensive in our modern American population.</P>
<P>  Supplementing with EPA PLUS is a rational approach to naturally increasing the amount of Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Docosahexaenoic Acid in our daily diets. This product represents a significant advantage over other marine oils, which can supply a potentially toxic amount of Vitamins A and D, while supplying lower amounts of EPA and DHA factors.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE EPA PLUS</H2>
<P>  It is recommended to take one or two capsules with the two major meals each day.  Many individuals also take EPA PLUS with the third meal as well. It is wise to limit the amount of saturated fat in your diet and increase the amount of high quality cold water fish.</P>

<H1>INNER MAGIC F: Herbs for Women</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HERBALS </H2>

<P>Herbs have been used since creation to provide for our health and well being, for entire civilizations for that matter. The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage. Main stream modern technology is now finally beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies.  This is usually referred to in the literature today as phytotherapy. We probably will never understand many of the secrets regarding how many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason to not take advantage of their benefits.</P>
<P>  To our knowledge, Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kinds of herbal based products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific nutritional goals. These other synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals,  amino  acids,  enzymes,  bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and concentrated tissue nutrients in select products.  By combining modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal based products are second to none anywhere in the world.</P>
<P>  Women, more so than men, are troubled with dynamic changes of the hormone levels in their bodies from day to day and almost moment to moment. Actually, the female endocrine system is always in a state of change, beginning with the first day of each month's cycle and continuing through the last, then the cycle starts all over gain. The herbs in INNER MAGIC F are known for their value in helping to balance the female hormonal system nutritionally.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FEMALE IMBALANCES</H2>
<P>  Symptoms of female imbalances are certainly wide and varied. It is staggering to think that more than 70% of women over the age of 35 have had some kind of hysterectomy.</P>
<P>  Hysterectomy usually results in many sudden hormone changes. When the ovaries are removed, a woman is in instant menopause, a condition wherein the ovaries stop producing estrogen. When this occurs, the adrenals normally take up the slack. However, with most menopausal women, their adrenals have been under so much stress that the adrenals are exhausted.</P>
<P>  The Life Plus INNER MAGIC F formula, as its name suggests, is formulated for special nutritional support for women.  INNER MAGIC F contains nutrients from twelve different herbs including Damiana, Cumin, Norwegian Kelp, Myrrh, Sarsaparilla, Buchu Leaves, Cayenne, Dong Quai, Saw Palmetto, Squaw Vine, Cramp Bark and False Unicorn.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  INNER MAGIC F is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE INNER MAGIC F</H2>
<P>  Most women find that INNER MAGIC F is valuable throughout the whole month, not just during that special time each month. The recommended dosage is two tablets twice a day, morning and evening. When special needs arise, more can be taken.</P>

<H1>PROGESTERONE PLUS: Natural Progesterone Plus Pregnenolone</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PROGESTERONE OVERLOOKED </H2>

<P>  Thousands of women in the western world are now using natural progesterone, generally in the form of a non-prescription product that is applied to the skin. They consistently not only claim less "female" symptoms, but experience increased vitality, better skin and a renewed emotional balance.  Natural progesterone has unfortunately been almost totally overlooked by medical science while the erroneous focus has been placed heavily (almost completely) on estrogen. It is important in this modem day for us to have a much better understanding of progesterone, the important natural hormone that it is.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PRECURSOR</H2>
<P>   It has been little realized that progesterone, like <A HREF="hendo.htm">DHEA</A>, has been referred to as the "mother of hormones." Progesterone is an important  precursor  in  the  biosynthesis  of  the  adrenal corticosteroids, which protect us against stress, and of all the sex hormones, including both testosterone and estrogen. This means that progesterone can be turned into one of many different hormones in the body as they are needed to maintain various metabolic functions in almost all of our tissues.  Unfortunately, most all the emphasis has been put on the importance of estrogen. However, it must be emphasized again that both estrogen and testosterone are made from progesterone.  Without adequate progesterone, both testosterone and estrogen would not be sufficiently available to the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ESTROGEN DOMINANCE</H2>
<P>   About 600,000 hysterectomies are performed every year in the USA alone.  According to Dr. Stanley West, noted fertility specialist and chief of reproductive endocrinology at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York and author of The Hysterectomy Hoax, about 90 percent of all hysterectomies are unnecessary. Dr. John Lee, long time medical practitioner and researcher of progesterone, has discovered a consistent theme running through women's complaints associated with PMS and menopause. That is, they experience estrogen dominance or put another way, they have too much estrogen in relationship to the amount of progesterone in their bodies.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HRT</H2>
<P>   These women, contrary to their actual needs, are given synthetic estrogen drugs.  In other words, when their estrogen levels are already too high when compared with progesterone levels, they are given more estrogen. It has become mainstream in modern medical practice to prescribe estrogen for menopausal and related symptoms.  This is referred to as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) by doctors.  The delicate estrogen/progesterone balance is greatly upset by too much estrogen, so progesterone deficiency is exaggerated all the more. Doctors have been able to balance the estrogen-dominance effect through with progesterone.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NATURAL PROGESTERONE</H2>
<P>   Between 40 and 60 percent of all western women experience premenstrual syndrome(PMS). Natural progesterone is made from wild yams or soybeans, whose active ingredients are an exact molecular match of the body's own progesterone. It is interesting to note that in countries in Asia and South America, where women eat quantities of either wild yams or soybeans, the term "hot flash" doesn't even exist in their languages. They also rarely experience most of the female problems plaguing western women.  One researcher, Jerilyn Prior, chief endocrinologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, reported in The <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>, has demonstrated that osteoporosis occurs in athletes to the degree that they become progesterone deficient. She became convinced that loss of bone density (osteoporosis) could be the result of progesterone deficiency. This was later confirmed by a three year study including sixty-three post-menopausal women.</P>
<P>   Natural progesterone supplementation is not known to have any side effects and no toxic levels have been found to date.  When adequate levels of progesterone are present in the body, libido is increased, the skin stays hydrated and oxygenated, facial hair growth and hair thinning is prevented, less depression occurs, fat burning is encouraged and blood clotting remains normal. There appears to be less breast and uterine cancer among women with higher levels of progesterone as well as less menopausal and PMS problems, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SYNTHETIC ESTROGEN & PROGESTINS</H2>
<P>  A <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> article in 1995 involving 121,700 women revealed that women who used synthetic estrogens and progestins to offset the symptoms of menopause also increased their chance of developing breast cancer by up to 40 percent by taking them for more than five years.   Current knowledge is evolving that these synthetic products are not good. Not only are synthetic estrogens responsible for increasing the probability of breast and uterine cancer, but also of increased storage of body fat, fluid retention, depression, headaches, impaired blood sugar control, reduced oxygen in cells, gallbladder problems, decreased sex drive, increased probability of fibroids and bone loss.</P>
<P>   The attempt to offset the negative effects of synthetic estrogen with synthetic progestins, only complicates the problems all the more.  It is important to know that the group of drugs that are referred to as progestins  are not progesterone.   They  are compounds that have altered molecules of progesterone that can be patented by companies for profit.  Synthetic progestins are not exact replicas of progesterone and can cause numerous side effects, such as headache, depression, fluid retention, increased risk of birth defects (they are included in birth control pills), liver dysfunction, breast tenderness, acne, insomnia, swelling, weight changes and PMS-like symptoms. They are not progesterone!</P>

<BR><BR><BR>
<H1>INNER MAGIC M: Herbs for Men</H1>
<BR>
 <IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ESPECIALLY FOR MEN </H2>

<P>  INNER MAGIC M is the male counterpart to INNER MAGIC E It is the most popular product of its kind on the market.</P>
 <P> While it is common knowledge that women are troubled with hormone imbalances, the same is true with men. We live in a world full of stress. Most men's work days are loaded with stressful situations.  They are usually required to travel more, eat on the run, start early and stop late. Good nutrition often takes a back seat. These factors set them up for trouble. The male gonadal system is designed to help men handle these kinds of situations.   INNER MAGIC M is the ideal way to supplement with herbs known to be nutritionally supportive of the male endocrine system.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT INNER MAGIC M DOES</H2>
<P>  INNER MAGIC M contains a unique blend of special herbs to nutritionally support the proper metabolic activities of the primary glands of the male endocrine system: the adrenals, the pituitary and the testicles. Supporting the pituitary seems to help fight stress. The testicles produce testosterone, which is the hormone primarily responsible for the maintenance of the physical male sex characteristics. Testosterone works in men like estrogen works in women. If the production of testosterone decreases, sex drive is diminished and infertility can even result.   It is also an important hormone in the conversion of fat to muscle tissue and seems to be associated with the more aggressive nature of most men. Low levels of testosterone in middle aged men have been shown to be at least partially responsible for lack of libido and general malaise.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMBALANCES</H2>
<P>  Symptoms of male hormone imbalance are many and quite often overlooked.  They include decreased sperm production,  diminished  sexual  desire,  impotency, nervousness, anxiety, mood changes, headache and loss of lean muscle mass.</P>
<P>   The male prostate gland is also important to fertility. It manufactures most of the fluids, buffers and enzymes in  semen.   By  age  50,  men  have  a 20%  risk of developing an enlarged, or inflamed prostate and by the age of  60 the chances are better than 50%. The prostate gland lies around the part of the urethra where it is attached to the bladder.</P>
 <P> When male hormone levels decrease with age, minute tissue changes occur similar to some of the changes in women during menopause. The prostate usually enlarges and becomes more firm. It pushes against the bladder and restricts the urethra. Men with this problem usually have to urinate frequently and then only with difficulty. Because of restricted flow, the urine also becomes concentrated in the bladder, and irritation and infection can result.</P>
<P>  The Life Plus INNER MAGIC M formula, as its name suggests, is formulated for special nutritional support for men.  Its unique formulation contains twelve special herbs chosen for their special synergistic nutritional effects.   They include Norwegian Kelp, Siberian Ginseng, Myrrh, Fennel, Parsley, Sarsaparilla (Smilax). Saw Palmetto Extract, Yohimbe PE, Juniper Berries, Gravel Root, Cayenne and Chlorophyll.</P>

<IMG SRC="n59.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  INNER MAGIC M is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.

<H1>WONDER GEL: Fast Acting, Pain Relieving Gel</H1>
<BR>
 
<P>
WONDER GEL is a fast acting, pain relieving, deep penetrating gel that is applied topically for the relief of aches and pains of stiff, swollen joints.  It is great for the relief of pain caused by overworked muscles and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis or bursitis. It combines the restorative properties of Aloe Vera, Colloidal Gold, Methyl Salicylate, plus two fantastic herbal concentrates of Jaborandi and Copaiba--two amazing rainforest botanicals used by Amazonian people for thousands of years to minimize muscle and joint pain and fight inflammation. People are usually amazed at how fast it works and how effective it is. Amazingly, it is also great for headaches, sinus discomfort and back pain as well. WONDER GEL is used for almost anything you can imagine. It can be used by all ages and virtually every medicine cabinet in every home should have a jar of this pleasant, non-greasy, non-staining topical pain relieving gel. An important part of the Life Plus RAINFORCE special line of effective products, WONDER GEL is an ideal product to demonstrate reliable and fast effectiveness of the RAINFORCE product line.<P>

<H2>HEALING THE BODY AND THE LAND</H2>
<P> The people of the rainforest have used plants found deep in the jungle for centuries to enhance vitality and overall health. This ancient wisdom is now available through WONDER GEL and other unique Life Plus RAINFORCE products. They bring you the benefits of highly effective natural herbal and plant extracts, harvested ecologically to preserve the natural resources of the rainforest and its people. Financial contributions are made supporting improved economics and education of the indigenous people.  Specific formulas are blended with other synergistic natural ingredients using current "state of the art" Life Plus technology, which results in fantastic, reliable results.</P>

<H2>UNLOCKING THE SECRETS OF THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  In addition to supporting athletic performance and quick recovery, the herbal ingredients in CATAGESIC have been used successfully by the indigenous tribes against symptoms of arthritis and rheumatism for centuries, In addition to the plants used for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, the added benefits of other synergistic ingredients in WONDER GEL help provide the arthritis and bursitis sufferer with many beneficial effects.  Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforest, WONDER GEL, a leading Life Plus RAINFORCE product, provides ancient rainforest tribal secrets of topical pain relief, reduced inflammation and a general overall improvement in general health when applied as needed.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>   All of the rainforest botanicals contained in WONDER GEL have been ecologically harvested by indigenous tribes to protect natural resources of the rainforest and its people. Education and a new income source from harvesting sustainable natural resources like the Copaiba Oil and Jaborandi herbal extract contained in WONDER GEL and other herbs contained in other Life Plus RAINFORCE products help provide an alternative to destroying our valuable rainforests.</P>

<H2>HOW TO USE WONDER GEL</H2>
<P>   The ways to use WONDER GEL are as varied as the thousands of people using it, Simply apply it to the areas in need as you desire.  When acute pain exists, usually applying it three or four times a day is best. Most people notice relief right away. Reduce the frequency of use as you can, It is totally non- toxic, non- greasy and pleasant to use. In addition to joint and muscle pain from conditions such as arthritis, don't forget to use it for other discomforts too like headaches, sinus discomfort, tiredness, etc. Avoid use around eyes, open wounds and mucous membranes.</P>

<BR>
<H2>POWER OF CAT'S CLAW</H2>
<P>   Cat's Claw, also referred to as "Una de gato", is the new North American leader in important medicinal plants and comes from the South American Peruvian Rainforest. Six oxindole alkaloids have been isolated in the inner bark of the plant and have been proven to provide a general boost to the immune system. Other alkaloids and phytochemicals (glycosides) present in Cat's Claw have been isolated and tested and are shown to provide pronounced natural anti-inflammatory benefits. As a true adaptogen with almost unlimited therapeutic applications, Cat's Claw has been called by experts as a "World Class Herb: a "Miracle Herb" and a "Sacred Herb of the Rainforest." Health care providers are now using it successfully with their arthritic patients for its anti-inflammatory and immune-stimulating properties.</P>
<P>    The alkaloid content of the Cat's Claw plant varies depending on quality. It ranges from 0.1% to 1.0% total alkaloids. Most Cat's Claw products contain as little as only 1 to 5 mg of alkaloids, which are actually bound to tannins. In Cats Claw bark, the alkaloids and tannins actually form a complex, which is not bioavailable without an acid to break it apart. The alkaloids contained in Life Plus CATAGESIC have been standardized, utilizing a proprietary process to not only contain 4% oxindole alkaloids but also break apart the alkaloid-tannin complex.  Very importantly, this makes the alkaloids 100% bioavailable.  Consequently, a full 8 mg of pure bioavailable oxindole alkaloids is contained in each CATAGESIC tablet. This is up to eight times more than other Cats Claw capsules sold today!</P>

<H2>SYNERGISTIC DYNAMIC RAINFOREST HERBS</H2>
<P> The principle rainforest herbs used for their synergistic effects  during  athletic  training  and  recovery  include Chuchuhuasi, Cat's Claw and Muira Puama because of their natural anti-arthritic, anti-rheumatic and anti-inflammatory properties.  Chuchuhuasi may well become the next highly important rainforest plant to follow Cat's Claw in the newest rainforest discoveries. A major pharmaceutical company is developing newly discovered phytochemicals found in Chuchuhuasi bark, which are highly anti-inflammatory. The indigenous name of this huge tree translates to "trembling bark", which describes the indigenous tribes century long use of the Chuchuhuasi for arthritis and rheumatism and which led modern day researchers to discover its properties.</P>
<P>   Suma is another powerful herb, which is by far the most well-researched. Studies dating back to 1968 reveal that Suma enhanced muscle building without producing the negative hormonal side effects steroids are noted for.  By 1976, Suma was labeled the "Russian Secret" when supplementation with Suma by the Russian Olympic team gave them the competitive edge in the 1976 Olympic games.</P>

<P>CATAGESIC contains a new proprietary standardized extract of Suma, which provides 5% Ecdysterones and Saponins. These are active ingredients found in Suma, which are thought to provide its benefits.</P>
<P>  Yerba Mate and Muira Puama are strong tonics and nervous system fortifiers; Maca and Yerba Mate are dynamic energy tonics used throughout the rainforest to increase stamina and endurance.  Sarsaparilla is used to support circulation, clear toxins and stimulate metabolism, while Iporuru nutritionally supports muscles and joints as well as provides natural analgesic. Cat's Claw and Sarsaparilla are both known for their oxygenating properties and Tayuya helps the body remove accumulating lactic acid in muscle tissue.  Tayuya also has well-known analgesic properties while Suma and Maca have a natural nutritional muscle building effect.</P>

<H2>UNLOCKING THE SECRETS OF THE RAINFOREST</H2> 
<P>In addition to supporting athletic performance and recovery, many of the plants in CATAGESIC have been used successfully by the indigenous tribes against symptoms of arthritis and rheumatism for centuries.   In addition to the plants being used for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, the added benefits of increased stamina and energy, plus overall muscle toning and growth, could provide the arthritis sufferer with many beneficial effects.  Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforest.  CATAGESIC, one of the great Life Plus RAINFORCE products, provides the ancient rainforest tribal secrets of improved energy, stamina, endurance and muscle growth as well as the secrets of the rainforest in the prevention of arthritis.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
</P>  All botanicals contained in CATAGESIC have been ecologically harvested by indigenous tribes to protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Education and a new income source from harvesting sustainable natural resources, like the herbs contained in CATAGESIC and all Life  Plus  RAINFORCE  products,  helps  provide  an alternative to destroying our valuable rainforests.</P>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to help the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<H2>HOW TO USE CATAGESIC</H2>
<P>   Take one tablet twice a day between meals.  Drink plenty of water to assist the body's natural processes. During times of special need, two to three tablets, two to three times per day as needed.</P>

<H1>CATIMUNE:</H1>
<H2>Cat's Claw (Una de gato) Plus Other Synergistic Immune Supporting Rainforest Herbs </H2>
<BR>

<H2> THE POWER OF CAT'S CLAW </H2>

<P>  Cat's Claw, also referred to as "Una de gato" and "Sacred Herb of the Rainforest," is the new leader in naturally occurring immune-supportive agents. All Cat's Claw utilized in Life Plus products is of the highest quality and is harvested in the Peruvian Rainforest in a sustainable ecological friendly manner.  Six oxindole alkaloids have been isolated from the inner bark of this wonderful plant and have been proven to provide a general boost to the immune system.  These oxindole alkaloids also have a profound effect on the ability of white blood cells to engulf and digest harmful microorganisms and foreign matter. This natural process is called phagocytosis.   Other alkaloids and phytochemicals present in Cat's Claw have been shown to provide natural support against many viri.  When included in the diet, they naturally support normal blood pressure and help prevent inflammation as well as act as anti-mutagenic agents.</P>
<P>  The Cat's Claw in CATIMUNE is the highest quality available worldwide and is standardized to an alkaloid content of 4% utilizing a new proprietary process. This provides a full 8 milligrams of pure oxindole alkaloids per tablet - over 2 to 8 times more than standard Cat's Claw capsules sold today! Why settle for standard Cat's Claw capsules when you can get more from CATIMUNE, plus the added benefits and actions of the other synergistic Rainforest botanicals in this powerful immune formula.  In addition to the standardized Cat's Claw extract, two more powerful standardized extracts are included, Pau d'Arco and Suma. These high quality standardized extracts guarantee the potency of the extracts and provide the highest amount of researched and documented beneficial phytochemicals available to provide an extremely potent and highly beneficial formula.</P>

<H2>FIVE-STEPS T0 BETTER IMMUNE FUNCTION </H2>
<P>The CATIMUNE formula is based on ancient and traditional methods employed by the indigenous tribes of the Rainforest. This, combined with the technology and science of today, guarantees potent standardized extracts. Using highly potent standardized extracts  like Cat's Claw containing 4% oxindole alkaloids and Suma containing 5% ecdysterones, plus saponins to increase our natural defense mechanisms is just the first, but an important step.</P>
<P>  The second step is to provide herbs and herbal extracts  with  natural  anti-viral,  anti-bacterial  and anti-parasitic actions that kill viri and bacteria directly. Cat's Claw and Pau d'Arco have been traditionally used for this purpose. Modern science has shown them to be highly effective, which validates their indigenous use. Pau d'Arco's anti-viral properties have been attributed to a set of phytochemicals called naphtoquinones and CATIMUNE provides a guaranteed potency of 3% of them in each tablet.  These important components in standardized extract form guarantees the potency and benefits of the herbal ingredients in CATIMUNE.</P>
<P>  The lymphatic system, much like a second circulatory system, is responsible for moving infection fighting killer cells from the blood stream into all other body cells There is no pump to control lymphatic fluid flow like the heart does in the blood circulatory system. Lymphatic flow depends on the contraction of muscles close to the walls of the lymphatic vessels when we move.  In other words, the lymphatic vessels are "massaged," which causes the lymphatic fluid (lymph) to flow. Carqueja and Sarsaparilla, two herbs indigenous to the rainforest, are included in CATIMUNE to support this important third step.</P>
<P>  The immune system's lymphocyte killer cells and the resulting debris from their work is contained in the bloodstream. The fourth step provided by several herbs in  CATIMUNE,   is  to   nutritionally   support  the circulatory system to help them find and attack invading bacteria.  Then, it is important to flush the resulting debris and toxins from the bloodstream. Carqueja is well-known in tribal medicine for its circulation and blood fortifying abilities. Sarsaparilla and Pau d'Arco have also been used for centuries as blood detoxifiers.</P>
<P>  The final step is to detoxify both the liver and kidneys to cleanse them completely. Chanca Piedra, also called "stone-breaker",  is world renown for its liver, kidney and gall bladder detoxifying benefits and is included in CATIMUNE for this benefit.</P>

<H2>HEALTH FROM THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforest. CATIMUNE, one of the great Life Plus RAINFORCE products, provides ancient Rainforest tribal secrets to improved immune function using an ancient 5-step formula and specific guaranteed potency botanicals, which have been used for centuries for their wealth of benefits in supporting immune function.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  All botanicals contained in CATIMUNE have been ecologically harvested by indigenous tribes to protect natural resources of the rainforest and its people. Education and a new income source from harvesting sustainable natural resources, like the herbs contained in the Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying our valuable rainforests.</P>
<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<H2>HOW TO USE CATIMUNE</H2>
 <P> Take one tablet twice daily on an empty stomach. Drink plenty of water to assist absorption. During times of special need or when exposed to bacterial or viral infections, take from two to three tablets, two or three times a day.</P>

Six oxindole alkaloids have been isolated from the inner bark of this wonderful plant. These oxindole alkaloids have been proven to provide a general boost to the immune system as well as have a profound effect on the ability of white blood cells to engulf and digest harmful microorganisms and foreign matter. This natural process is called phagocytosis. Other alkaloids and phytochemicals present in Cat's Claw have been shown to provide natural support against many viri. When included in the diet, they naturally  insure  normal  blood  pressure  and  help  prevent inflammation, plus act as anti-mutagenic agents.</p>
 <p>   Life Plus CATS CLAW FORTE Drops contain the highest quality Una de gato available worldwide and is standardized. As a true daptogen with almost unlimited therapeutic applications, Cat's Claw has been called by experts as a "World Class Herb," a "Miracle Herb" and a "Sacred Herb of the Rainforest." Health care providers are now using it successfully with their patients in the prevention of many conditions such as arthritis, cancer, AIDS, Crohn's Disease, viral infections, respiratory infections, allergies, herpes, prostrate problems, lupus, Epstein Barr, rheumatism, chronic fatigue syndrome, PMS, diabetes and a variety of stomach and bowel disorders.</p>

<h2>MAXIMIZED BIOAVAILABLITY</h2>
 <p>  Dr. Klaus Keplinger's group in Austria are, by far, the most knowledgeable in the subject of Cat's Claw. They have researched Cat's Claw and its extraction methods for over fifteen years.  The following is quoted from an English translation from some of Keplinger's published information to Doctors and Pharmacists. Quoted from an English translation of "Radix Uncaria Tomentosae: Informative Literature by Klaus Keplinger" by the title of "Der Krallendorn Tee": 
<blockquote>"The active substances in the Cat's Claw Tea are alkaloids, which occur in the plant and its watery extract as a complex bound to tannins. In this form, only little of them can be activated. The complexes get split by the acidic milieu of the stomach; the alkaloids get transformed into their hydrochloride form and, in this way, get well absorbed."</blockquote></p>
<p>   It is well known that plants containing both alkaloids and tannins form complexes that Keplinger refers to which eliminate their bioavailability. Therefore, any health promoting benefits of these phytochemicals are not realized because they are not absorbed. Many herbalists will not combine different plants with active constituents of both alkaloidal and/or tannic forms in a herbal formula for this reason.</p>
<p>   Many Cat's Claw extracts are dark red to dark reddish-brown and consumers incorrectly believe that "the darker the color, the more concentrated the extract." This is not true! A darker Cat's Claw extract means more tannin is present and beneficial alkaloids are locked up with tannins, which have formed a non-bioavailable and poorly absorbed complex.</p>
<p>   When a concentrated liquid herbal extract is taken by mouth, the active ingredients are absorbed in the mouth, throat and upper stomach and very little reaches the lower stomach and the stomach acid.   Consumers believe that sublingual absorption of these extracts will expedite the active constituents to become absorbed more quickly into the bloodstream. However, with these other high tannin extracts this is not correct. The sublingual absorption of Cat's   Claw alkaloid-tannin complexes greatly reduces bioavailability and the benefits and desired results that the alkaloids can provide.</p>
<p>   CATS CLAW FORTE Drops are very different than all other liquid extracts. In addition to developing and utilizing a proprietary extraction method, it utilizes organic apple vinegar in place of water or alcohol. This natural acid releases the alkaloids from the tannins and very little tannin is extracted. This makes the extracted alkaloids 100% bioavailable, which can be evidenced in the light golden color of Life Plus CATS CLAW FORTE Drops. For this reason also, the assayed alkaloid content of CATS CLAW FORTE Drops is 4-6 times higher than other available water/glycerin or alcohol extracts, which for the most part aren't bioavailable, and provides 10 milligrams of pure bioavailable oxindole alkaloids per 30 drops. Using vinegar in the process not only releases the alkaloids from the tannins, it actually extracts more alkaloids.</p>

<h2>NEW PROCESS - SYNERGISTIC EFFECT</h2>
<p>  The immune system is equally involved in many other protective processes in the body.  These include its response to allergy producing substances, controlling the rate and aspects of aging, protection from free radicals and protection against degenerative diseases such as arthritis, cancer, arteriosclerosis and others. Probably the most well understood and studied is allergies and cancer.  Nutritionally supporting the immune system with natural substances like alkoxyglycerols has much more value than just helping the body fight off infections.</p>

<h2>HEALTH FROM THE RAINFOREST</h2>
<p>   Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforest tribes. CATS CLAW FORTE Drops, of the great Life Plus RAINFORCE products, reveals the ancient secrets to improved immune function, preventing inflammation and supporting energy.</p>

<h2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</h2>
 <p>  The herbal extracts in CATS CLAW FORTE Drops have been ecologically harvested using indigenous tribes to protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Only the alkaloid-rich inner bark is utilized.  The alkaloids and phytochemicals in the inner bark are almost identical to those found in the root of Cat's Claw and harvesting this way preserves the plant and provides for the future of the rainforest. Life Plus does not endorse harvesting Cat's Claw root and endangering our future supply of this important plant. Providing education and a new income source derived from harvesting sustainable natural resources, including plants found in Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying this valuable resource.</p>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<H1>TOUCHFIRE HERS:</H1>
<H2>Drops for Women Enhancing Sexual Desire </H2>
<BR>

<H2> EXCLUSIVELY FOR WOMEN </H2>

<P>  From the dawn of our existence, man has continued on many quests--the quest for fire, magic potions and others. No quest has been so consistent throughout recorded history as our search for ways to stimulate sexual desire and to intensify sexual satisfaction.  TOUCHFIRE HERS Drops was developed exclusively for women and contains a synergistic blend of herbal extracts from the Amazon Rainforest. These plants have been used for centuries by the indigenous people of the rainforest.</P>
<P>   Stimulating female sexual desire is much more complex than stimulating male sex drive because a woman's focus and mental state plays a much larger role. The ability to relax, unwind and shut out the stress of the day in order to focus more fully on the sexual experience is just as important as increasing desire.  For this reason, several RAINFORCE botanicals are included in the TOUCHFIRE HERS Drops, which have a documented history of use in enhancing mental acuity and focus, reducing stress, increasing focus, and acting as a general tonic and relaxant to provide these types of benefits.</P>
 <P>  Hormonal imbalances, cycles and fluctuations can cause nervousness, stress, irritability, mood swings and even depression in many women. Balancing these many hormones is a key factor in supporting a woman's natural sexual drive. Botanicals well known for their hormonal balancing ability specifically for women play another key role in this formula so that women and their partners are not at the mercy of these cyclical patterns or  problems.  With these two important areas addressed, rainforest herbs used by the indigenous tribes to increase sexual desire, enhance skin sensations and act as sexual stimulants are contained in TOUCHFIRE HERS to provide synergistic and overall effectiveness.</P>

<H2>LONG HISTORY OF DYNAMIC EFFECTS </H2>
<P>Chuchuhuasi and Catuaba are the best known and most famous sexual stimulants of many tribes throughout the Peruvian Rainforest. Their sexual stimulating and tonic effects are legendary in this regard. Maca is cultivated high in the Andes Mountains in Peru where it has been utilized for centuries to increase sexual desire and fertility, increase stamina and endurance and promote mental clarity. Damiana with its ancient reputation as a sexual stimulant also acts as an antidepressant and tonic to both the central nervous and hormonal systems. Suma, called "Brazilian Ginseng" has been used for centuries to combat fatigue and balance female hormones in cases of frigidity and impotency. Sarsaparilla has a worldwide reputation and history dating back to the 1600's as a reliable, sexual stimulant. In addition, Abuta is known throughout Amazonia as a "midwives herb," employed specifically for women as a uterine tonic and relaxant as well as to increase sexual desire.</P>

<H2>HEALTH FROM THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  The rainforest plants in TOUCHFIRE HERS Drops contain vital phytochemicals and phytosterols, which nutritionally support the entire female sexual system, hormonal system, as well as the nervous system.  The indigenous people of the Amazon and rainforest regions have used these specific botanicals for centuries, not only as female tonics and sexual enhancers, but as tribal medicine to fight reduced fertility and hormonal imbalances, including menopause.  Some have even been used in marriage and fertility ceremonies for decades.  Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforests of the world. TOUCHFIRE HERS, one of the great Life Plus RAINFORCE products, provides the ancient rainforest tribal secrets supporting the health of women by helping to increase their sexual desire as well as helping to naturally and nutritionally balance hormone levels.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  All  botanicals  in  TOUCHFIRE  HERS  have  been ecologically harvested by indigenous tribes to protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Education and a new income source derived from harvesting a sustainable natural resource like the herbs found in TOUCHFIRE HERS and all Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying our valuable rainforests.</P>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<H2>HOW TO USE TOUCHFIRE HERS</H2>
<P>  TOUCHFIRE HERS Drops is furnished with a dropper. One dropperful contains approximately 30 drops. For best results, place 30 to 40 drops in two to three ounces of water or juice and take on an empty stomach.  Used as an occasional aid to increase female sexual desire, take 30 to 40 drops one or two hours before intimate activity.</P>
<P>  Most women take TOUCHFIRE HERS Drops on more of a routine basis. If you have special needs due to stress or lack of sex drive, take 30-40 drops twice a day for a minimum of 30 days for maximum benefit. Many women continue with this twice-a-day dosage on an ongoing basis.  However, you may try taking TOUCHFIRE HERS once a day after the initial month.   Each woman must adjust according to her needs. TOUCHFIRE HERS contains alcohol, which must be used for extracting and preserving the active phytochemicals found in the rainforest herbs contained in TOUCHFIRE HERS.  If you are sensitive to alcohol, place the recommended dosage in 2 to 3 ounces of hot or near-boiling water and let cool to lukewarm before taking; the alcohol will quickly evaporate.</P>

<H1>TOUCHFIRE HIS:</H1>
<H2>Drops for Men to Enhance Sexual Desire </H2>
<BR>

<H2> EXCLUSIVELY FOR MEN </H2>

<P>  TOUCHFIRE HIS Drops was developed exclusively for men and contains five powerful, high-potency herbal extracts from the Amazon Rainforest that have been used for centuries to increase male sexual desire as male tonics and to support male testosterone levels. The key ingredient of this dynamic new formula is a highly concentrated extract of an indigenous rainforest plant called Muira puama (also known as Potency Wood). Recent clinical research has shown an herbal extract of Muira puama to be highly effective in over 62% of 362 men studied in increasing libido and in successfully treating organic and psychogenic-related impotency. Compared to a clinically established effectiveness rate of only 34% for the only available prescription drug for impotency and lack of sexual desire, these are significant new findings.  The other natural  botanical  extracts  in  TOUCHFIRE  HIS  work synergistically with Muira puama to naturally calm nervous tension  and  stress,  nutritionally  support  male  hormone levels, act  as tonics to the prostrate and more importantly they increase sexual desire for men through increased bioavailable testosterone.</P>

<H2>AGING AND IMPOTENCY</H2>
<P>   Men are capable of retaining their sexual virility well past their 80's.  Although impotency is thought to affect over 25% of men over the age of 50, many times it is only temporary and can be reversed with the proper nutritional support. Today, an estimated 10 to 20 million men suffer from erectile dysfunction or some type of organic impotency, and organic causes of impotency account for approximately 90% of all cases in men over 50. This number is expected to increase dramatically as the median age of the population increases. In a 1986 clinical study, it was documented that actual testosterone production doesn't generally decrease as men age, but the amount of free circulating testosterone does diminish as more gets bound to the albumin and becomes unavailable for the body's use. These changes appear to begin by middle age and happen during a natural chemical process called ''sex-hormone-binding-globulin" or ''SHBG''. Other researchers believe that the increase in SHBG is a major contributing factor in prostate disorders, impotency and a decline in sex drive.  New European research reported in 1995 reveals that an extract of Nettle Root can interfere with this SHBG binding process by almost l0-fold.</P>

<H2>LONG HISTORY OF DYNAMIC EFFECTS</H2>
<P>  Muira puama has long been valued by the Peruvian and Brazilian Indians to increase sexual desire in men, and as a tonic for the nervous system. This has been documented in books written as early as 1930. This long history and substantial documentation has led current researchers like Dr. Waynberg to clinically evaluate it's effectiveness as a sexual stimulant and a possible treatment for impotency.   Catuaba, the  most famous of all Brazilian sexual enhancing plants, has been so highly regarded as a male libido enhancer and sexual stimulant that the Tupi Indians have praised it's wonders in many songs for generations.  Damiana has such an ancient reputation that it was even carried over to its botanical name, Turnera aphrodisiaca.  After centuries of use, renown herbalists like David Hoffman, now believe that its alkaloids could have a testosterone-like action.  Sarsaparilla has a worldwide reputation and history of use dating back to the 1600's as an aphrodisiac and male tonic. It contains at least 9 documented plant steroids, several of which are only found in Sarsaparilla. Nettle Root has been shown to increase free floating testosterone levels, and increased testosterone is a well documented natural libido enhancer.</P>

<H2>HEALTH FROM THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>   The rainforest plants in the TOUCHFIRE HIS Drops contain vital phytochemicals and phytosterols, which nutritionally support the entire male sexual hormonal system as well as the nervous system.  The indigenous people of the Amazon and rainforest regions have used these specific botanicals for centuries, not only as male tonics and sexual enhancers, but also as tribal medicine to fight reduced fertility and male hormonal imbalances, especially lowered testosterone levels. Some have even been used in marriage and fertility ceremonies for decades. Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforests of the world. TOUCHFIRE HIS, one of the great Life Plus RAINFORCE products, provides the ancient rainforest tribal secrets supporting the health of men by helping to increase their sexual desire as well as helping to naturally and nutritionally balance hormone levels.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>   All botanicals in TOUCHFIRE HIS have been ecologically harvested by indigenous tribes to protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Education and a new income source derived from harvesting a sustainable natural resource like the herbs found in TOUCHFIRE HIS and all Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying our valuable rainforests.</P>
<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<H2>HOW TO USE TOUCHFIRE HIS</H2>
<P>  TOUCHFIRE HIS Drops is furnished with a dropper. One dropperful contains approximately 30 drops. For best results, place 30 to 40 drops in two to three ounces of water or juice and take on an empty stomach.  Used as an occasional aid to increase male sexual desire, take 30 to 40 drops one or two hours before intimate activity.</P>
<P>  Most men take TOUCHFIRE HIS Drops on a more routine basis. If you have special needs due to stress or lack of sex drive, take 30-40 drops twice a day for a minimum of 30 days for maximum benefit.
   Many men continue with this twice-a-day dosage on an ongoing basis. However, you may try taking TOUCHFIRE HIS once a day after the initial month.  Each man must adjust according to his needs. TOUCHFIRE HIS contains alcohol, which must be used for extracting and preserving the active phytochemicals found in the rainforest herbs contained in TOUCHFIRE HIS.   If you are sensitive to alcohol, place the recommended dosage in 2 to 3 ounces of hot or near-boiling water and let cool to lukewarm before taking; the alcohol will quickly evaporate.</P>

<p>
 Quality is paramount at Life Plus.<p>

The Life Plus foundation has evolved with over fifty years of experience in manufacturing "doctor quality" leading edge nutritional supplements.<p>
<p>
Our unique product line utilizes only the highest quality materials which are as natural as possible. They are formulated in the most synergistic way to provide optimum nutritional results.<p>
<p>
Because our products are manufactured in-house, we can naturally guarantee potency and quality and provide them at economical, realistic, wholesale prices.<p>
<p>
Our formulas are pH balanced, hypoallergenic, synergistic and contain no artificial additives. We use only natural and naturally derived manufacturing aids. We do not use preservatives, artificial coloring or flavoring or flavoring agents, soy derivatives, corn, salt, or sugar in our formulas.<p>
<p>
Even though our method of cold processing is costly and time consuming, this type of processing is the natural choice since heat destroys the activity of many vitamins, enzymes and phytonutrients.<p>
<p>
The Life Plus nutritional product line is complete, but not complex. Active enzymes, nutritional precursors  and phytonutrients are important components of each unique Life Plus formula.<p>
<p>
Most Life Plus products are formulated in our proprietary PhytoZyme base which contains phytonutrients and proteolytic enzymes. This assures a broad spectrum base of phytochemical trace nutrients for numerous synergistic co-factors and maximum bio-availability and utilization.<p>

<BR>
<BR>
<center><H1>We've found the secrets of a healthier world living in the Amazon Rainforest. </H1>
<BR>
<H2>Yet, every year, mankind destroys an area of rainforest nearly one-half the size of Texas. </H2></center>
<BR>
<P>You can be a part of the Life Plus Rainforce to help save and protect the rainforest, promote both good health and a healthier planet.</P>
<P>Earth's greatest natural resource is quite literally going up in smoke, since over 320 square miles of irreplaceable primary rainforest are burned or logged <I>every day</I>. Only twenty years ago, rainforests covered about fourteen percent of the earth's land area. Today, rainforests are less than six percent.</P>
<P>At the current rate of destruction, this miraculous web of life will be totally wiped out in forty years. 
The importance of these fragile eco-systems to the health of our world cannot be overstated:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Over half of Earth's living species live there.</LI>
<LI>Two-and-a-half acres of Amazon Rainforest contain over seven hundred-fifty types of trees, more than all of North America.</LI>
<LI>Two-thirds of the Earth's fresh water is found in the Amazon River basin.</LI>
<LI>Seventy percent of the plants currently found to be active against cancers come from the rainforests.</LI>
<LI>Over one hundred and twenty prescription drugs and twenty-five percent of all pharmaceuticals originate from rainforest material.</LI>
</UL>
<CENTER><H2>The RainForce, providing a force for a healthier world. </H2></CENTER>
<P>The key to turning this tide of destruction lies in providing long-term, economically viable alternatives to the current exploitation of the rainforest by timber companies, oil companies, agra-business and others.</P>
<P>Not only is it environmentally sound, but sustainable harvesting of rainforest plants makes more economic sense than the alternatives. It is estimated that sustainable harvesting of one acre of Peruvian Amazon rainforest can produce over $2400 annually for the Peruvian people. In contrast, clear-cutting for timber nets only $400 per acre and cattle grazing earns only $60 per acre.</P>
<CENTER><H2>The RainForce, A Solution</H2></CENTER>
<P>Life Plus is proud to introduce the RainForce. As a catalyst for progressive change, it encompasses people and organizations working towards a healthier planet using, and encouraging others to use, products that have been sustainably harvested from these endangered rainforests of the world. The moral imperative we all should feel is to leave the world a little better than it was when we arrived. Truly, the RainForce is many things:</P>
<UL>
<LI>It's Life Plus Members using Rainforce products, and telling others about these products.</LI>
<LI>It's indigenous peoples of the rainforest areas earning a livable income from non-destructively harvesting the fruits of the forest.</LI>
<LI>It's consumers throughout the world, seeking products that are sustainably harvested from the rainforest.</LI>
<LI>Most importantly, <B>YOU</B> are part of the RainForce.</LI>
</UL>
<CENTER><H2>The Pharmacy of the World</H2></CENTER>
<P>The indigenous peoples of the rainforest have learned many of the health secrets hidden within dense vegetation, utilizing over eighteen-hundred species of plants for medicinal and health purposes.</P>
<P>Life Plus has tapped this ancient wisdom in developing the RainForce product line by studying with indigenous Amazon healers and integrating this age-old knowledge with the advanced technology and product application expertise that is the hallmark of Life Plus.</P>
<P>Utilizing some twenty-five rainforest plants in these formulations, Life Plus uses costly <I>cold-processing</I> techniques, without chemical agents to refine and concentrate active ingredients as standardized whole complexes, complete with all the naturally occurring enzymes and other phytonutrients that create their synergistic effectiveness.</P>

<H2> EMERGING AWARENESS </H2>

<P>   As society develops new awareness of the importance of natural foods we understand why we should eat them. In the fast-paced lives we live, it is difficult to consume the recommended seven cups of fruits and vegetables every day. It is even difficult or impractical for many people to obtain them.</P>
 <P>  As our scientific community learns more about our foods, they are also learning what they contain. It is an almost everyday occurrence in national news about some researcher finding a new substance in broccoli, cauliflower, carrots or whatever. The news expounds these new "finds" are linked to cancer, birth defects, asthma, arthritis, etc. These substances have been in our foods all along but we are just beginning to learn about them.</P>
<P>    One thing is for sure, our bodies, and the trillions of cells that make it up, were designed to have them to metabolize properly, stay healthy and live a productive life. Without reasonable amounts of them, our cells and organs simply could not function properly.   When this happens, we see signs of deficiencies such as chronic infections, improper healing of wounds, lack of energy, unbalanced blood chemistry, nervousness and anxiety, lack of mental acuity and all kinds of degenerative diseases.</P>

<H2>"PHYTO"</H2>
<P>   Our digestive system is efficient in digesting and absorbing nutrients from fruits and vegetables.  It is now understood that we obtain the basic three food groups from vegetables, that is fats, proteins and carbohydrates.  We need them for tissue repair, growth and development and the production of hormones, enzymes and other substances. We also get energy in the form of calories from them.</P>
<P>   A whole new area has come into view the last few years--what the scientific community calls "phytochemicals." In the nutrition industry, we call them "phytonutrients." Actually, both terms are correct. They are chemicals and also nutrients. "Phyto" is the term used in botany, herbal science and in the scientific and natural health communities to label any substance coming from a plant. The term actually comes from the Greek word phyton, meaning "a plant."  So then, phytonutrients are nutritional substances that come from plants.</P>

<H2>SPECIFIC PHYTONUTRIENTS</H2>
<P>   Numerous phytonutrients have been identified and isolated. Yet common sense tells us that there are many more. A partial listing of some of them includes allyl sulfides in garlic, onions, leeks, chives and shallots; capsaicin in chili peppers; genistein in soy beans; polyphenol catechins in green and black teas; camosol in rosemary; lignans in flaxseed; glycerrhizin in licorice root; limonenes in citrus fruits; sulforaphane in broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, turnips and kale; lycopene in tomatoes, red grapefruit, watermelon and apricots; alpha-carotene in carrots and seaweed; beta-carotene in carrots, squash, apricots, peaches, red, yellow and dark green vegetables; lutein/zeaxanthin in yellow squash, spinach, collards, mustard and turnip greens; polyphenols (bioflavonoids) in red grapes and wine, artichokes, strawberries and blueberries, anthocanins in cranberries and currents; gingerol in gingeroot; phytic acid in rye, wheat, rice, lima beans, sesame seeds, peanuts and soybeans; phenethyl isothiocyanates 
in horseradish, mustard, cabbage and turnips; saponins in kidney beans, chickpeas and lentils; onoterpenes in basil, carrots, parsley, mint, cabbage, citrus and caraway seeds; indoles in brussels sprouts, cabbage, kale and dark green leafy vegetables.</P>

<H2>SUPER GREEN ALGAE</H2>
<P>   These "super foods" are simply power houses of phytonutrients and high quality, easily utilized nutrients.  They are cultured in controlled environments to insure they are free of chemicals and are one of the most highly concentrated sources of nutrition available. RICH 'N GREEN contains three of the most important ones, Chlorella, Spirulina and Hydra Green.  They have special value because of their large amount of chlorophyll, which is a great detoxifier in the body.  They are high in RNA (ribonucleic acids), which are used in the body to produce DNA. These super algae are also rich in carotenes and lypoic acid.</P>

<H2>MAITAKE & REISHI MUSHROOMS</H2>
<P>   A number of mushrooms have been used by eastern civilizations for centuries. Maitake and Reishi are two of the most valuable because of their ability in supporting the immune system. They are also known as good protectors of the liver.</P>

<H2>BARLEY & WHEAT GRASS</H2>
<P>   Grains such as barley and wheat all produce a grass. When it is in the early "sprout" stage it is loaded with incredible amounts of nutritional  value.   They are particularly rich in  plant enzymes, beta-carotene, Vitamins A, C and K, chlorophyll, RNA, DNA, antioxidants and amino acids.   They are simply a gold mine of phytonutrients fitting for a healthy diet.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  The food concentrates from the Amazon Rainforests in RICH 'N GREEN tablets have been ecologically harvested using indigenous tribes to help protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Providing education and a new income source derived from harvesting sustainable natural resources like the phytonutrients in RICH 'N GREEN tablets and other Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying this valuable resource.</P>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>


<H2>HOW TO USE RICH 'N GREEN</H2>
<P>   There is no iron-clad method how to take RICH 'N GREEN tablets. Two RICH 'N GREEN tablets supply the equivalent amount of vitamins, minerals, plant enzymes and other phytonutrients as one full cup of fresh vegetables.  The U. S. Government recommends seven one-cup servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Adjust to your needs.  If it is difficult for you to obtain and prepare your daily vegetables, these tablets are very convenient.   The foods in RICH 'N GREEN tablets have not been cooked and are in the most valuable "raw" state. So, you also obtain the greatest benefit from their phytonutrients.</P>

<H1>JUNGLE ADE:</H1>
<H2>Super Concentrated Phytonutrient Amazon Fruit Drink </H2>
<BR>

<H2> EXOTIC BLEND </H2>

<P>   JUNGLE ADE is an exotic blend of tropical fruits that grow in the pristine Amazon Rainforest -- rich in vitamins, minerals and all kinds of phytonutrients that can be found nowhere on earth other than in this diverse incredible ecosystem.  These exotic fruits, Camu-Camu, Passion Fruit, Guava, Cashew Fruit and Cupuacu are full of important nutrients as nature intended and contain many synergistic phytonutrients never before seen.</P>

<H2>TOTALLY ORGANIC</H2>
<P>   As North American agricultural methods, which utilize synthetic fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, continue to destroy the balance of our soils and disturb the natural balance of nature, the fruits and vegetables growing in the totally natural environment of the Amazon basin in South America become more and more important. The fruits used in the JUNGLE ADE formula are 100% totally organic and free of chemical contaminants.</P>

<H2>NEVER BEFORE</H2>
<P>   RAINFORCE JUNGLE ADE includes several new and delicious fruits, never before offered in North America or Europe, which have been harvested in the Amazon Jungle by indigenous tribes and local communities. These exotic fruits have been juiced and then dried by a new and proprietary process, which preserves their valuable phytonutrients, preserving everything that nature intended in a convenient dry granular form that is easily mixed with water in your home to make a delicious and nutritious beverage.</P>

<H2>CAMU-CAMU</H2>
<P>   One of the rainforest's newest discoveries is a delicious fruit by the name Camu-Camu. It is included in Life Plus JUNGLE ADE for its high nutritive value and pleasant taste. This small lemon-sized fruit is presently the highest known source of natural Vitamin C on the planet and grows wild in the Amazon Rainforest. Camu-Camu, also known as Rumberry, provides 3,000% of the Vitamin C, 300% of the Niacin, 200% of the Riboflavin and 150% of the Phosphorous than oranges.</P>

<H2>CASHEW FRUIT</H2>
<P>   In addition to Camu-Camu, JUNGLE ADE contains Cashew Fruit, also known as Cajueiro, Cupuacu, Maracuja and Guava fruits. Unlike the well known cashew nuts that are so popular all over the world, Cajueiro is a highly nutritious fruit.  It is very peculiar and really isn't a fruit at all.  It is actually a swollen peduncle that grows behind the real fruit, which is the cashew nut. This large pulpy and juicy part of the plant is actually referred to as a pseudo-fruit with a fine sweet flavor and aroma. The cashew nut grows externally on one end of it in its own kidney shaped hard shell.  Interesting Amazonian folklore include the cashew juice as an aid for flu and colds, a sexual stimulant, and other things.  Cashew fruit contains five times the amount of Vitamin C as oranges, too.</P>

<H2>CUPUACU</H2>
<P>   The Cupuacu fruit is in the chocolate family and looks much like the fruit of the chocolate tree. The Life Plus RAINFORCE makes Cupuacu fruit available for the first time in North America and Europe. Rich in phytonutrients with a delicious exotic taste, Cupuacu has been a primary food source in the rainforest, both for the indigenous people and animals alike. It is about the size of a cantaloupe and is highly prized for its creamy, exotic tasting pulp throughout the Amazon basin. it is used throughout Peru and Brazil to make fresh juice, ice cream, jam and tarts.</P>

<H2>PASSION FRUIT</H2>
<P>   An important constituent of JUNGLE ADE is Passion Fruit. A certain species known as Maracuja, is the type that grows in the Amazon Rainforest and is the one included in JUNGLE ADE. Maracuja juice has been used a wonderful source of power packed phytonutrients as well as a good tasting fruit.</P>

<H2>GUAVA</H2>
<P>   Guava, also known as Goiaba, is enjoyed as a sweet treat by indigenous people throughout the rainforest. It has traditionally been recommended as a natural fruit for diabetics and for those needing to maintain consistent blood sugar levels. It tastes great and contains a high concentration of health-supporting plant enzymes.</P>

<H2>HELPING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
 <P>  All of the natural fruits contained in JUNGLE ADE have been ecologically harvested using indigenous tribes to help protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Providing education and a new income source derived from harvesting a sustainable natural resource like all five of the delicious fruits found in JUNGLE ADE and herbs in other Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying our valuable rainforest resource. For instance, world renown ethnobotanist, Mark Plotkin states that " a forest stand of Camu-Camu is worth twice the amount to be gained from cutting down the forest and replacing it with cattle." He believes the rational nurturing and harvesting of medicinal herbs and the nutritious fruits contained in JUNGLE ADE holds real economic promise for local Amazon communities. The Life Plus RAINFORCE is proud to be the first to make this important new resource available to North America and Europe and is dedicated to be the leader in helping to create an economical alternative to destroying the rainforest.</P>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>


<H2>HOW TO USE JUNGLE ADE</H2>
  <P>  Stir, shake or blend one or more teaspoonfuls of JUNGLE ADE concentrate, according to taste, per each eight ounce glass of clear, contaminant-free  drinking  water  to  make  a  super-tasting, phytonutrient-rich, health beverage. It can be mixed one glass at a time or by the quart or half gallon.  Store in refrigerator after mixing. JUNGLE ADE can be used just as a nutritious, enjoyable beverage or can be used to swallow supplement tablets for the synergistic phytonutrients it contains.  JUNGLE ADE is great to use in mixing with powdered protein drinks like <A HREF="http://www.liberty.com/home/appaloosa/promax.htm">PROMAX</A> and for preparing <A HREF="http://www.liberty.com/home/appaloosa/colodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A>. For milk lovers, a fruit creme can be easily made by mixing JUNGLE ADE about 50/50 with milk.   Think of JUNGLE ADE as a replacement for carbonated soft drinks and sugary children's' drinks as well.</P>

<H1>JATOBA TEA:</H1>
<H2>High Energy & Health Tea from the Amazon Rainforest </H2>
<BR>

<H2> UNIQUE TREASURE </H2>

<p>  JATOBA TEA is definitely one of the most unique treasures of both of the Brazilian and Peruvian Rainforest. JATOBA TEA is well known to the people of the Amazon and has been used there for centuries as a staple herbal component of many of the indigenous people. It has been used extensively for hundreds of years by the lumberjacks in the Brazil forests as an energizer to help them feel strong and vigorous.  They can be seen day after day, heading off to work, carrying their "jug" of JATOBA TEA. They work hard and need lots of energy to keep going in the hot and humid climate of the rainforest.</p>

<h2>GOOD TASTING</h2>
<p>  JATOBA TEA is truly good tasting and can be used as an herbal beverage by the whole family, or it can be used at special times for special purposes as part of an overall health-supporting program.  It can be drank alone, just by adding hot water, or honey can be added if desired. Some individuals in South America believe the benefits of JATOBA TEA are enhanced when honey is added. However, it is always of value to add a little lemon juice to the tea. The acidity from the lemon juice helps to free the active alkaloid substances from the tannins so that they are much more easily absorbed into the body to provide their benefits. It is not necessary to add so much lemon that the tea becomes too tart, only a little is adequate.</p>

<h2>OTHER INDIGENOUS USES</h2>
 <p>  Besides being used for weakness, energy and stamina, JATOBA TEA has been used as a tonic for the respiratory and urinary systems by the indigenous people of the Amazon Basin for centuries. Like Pau d' Arco, Jatoba is known for its ability to fight fungus and yeast-like candida albicans. Jatoba is also included in Life Plus <A HREF="http://www.liberty.com/home/appaloosa/prost.htm">PROSTATE FORMULA</A>. This great tasting tea is packaged in 30 convenient, easy-to-use tea bags per box. Just drink it hot or cold as you would any tea.</p>

<h2>SYNERGISTIC WITH OTHER PRODUCTS</h2> 
<p>JATOBA TEA is extremely beneficial by itself or is also very useful as an addition to the diet as a synergistic beverage for those needing more energy, experiencing discomfort of the respiratory or urinary systems and in support of all weight loss programs.  It is especially synergistic when taken together with Life Plus <A HREF="http://www.liberty.com/home/appaloosa/prost.htm"> PROSTATE FORMULA</A>. Also it can be a very worthwhile addition to those taking Life Plus <A HREF="http://www.liberty.com/home/appaloosa/lung.htm">LUNG FORMULA</A> for its synergistic effects. Some people notice an increase in frequency of urination and include it along with <A HREF="http://www.liberty.com/home/appaloosa/diuplx.htm">DIUPLEX</A> when desired.</p>

<h2>UNLOCKING THE SECRETS OF THE RAINFOREST</h2> 
<p>In addition to the bark of the Jatoba tree being used for energy and stamina, it has been used for numerous other health benefits for centuries.   Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the Amazon Rainforests. Life Plus and Life Plus Members are committed to doing everything within their power to ensure the preservation of our life-giving rainforests.</p>

<h2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</h2>
<p>   Life Plus JATOBA TEA is a natural botanical product. It is made from the bark of the Jatoba tree known scientifically as Hymenaea courbaril. The bark is ecologically harvested using indigenous tribes to help protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Providing education and a new income source derived from harvesting a sustainable natural resource like Jatoba found in Life Plus JATOBA TEA and other Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying this valuable resource.</p>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<h2>HOW TO USE JATOBA TEA</h2>
<p>  Steep one JATOBA TEA bag in one full cup (8 oz) of boiling water for at least five minutes.  The longer it steeps, the more nutrients the tea will contain. Add some lemon juice to aid the bioavailability of important phytonutrients. Add honey to taste if desired. Drink as a delicious hot or iced beverage, two or more times per day or as desired for energy, to support the urinary or respiratory systems, or for its natural anti-fungal action. JATOBA TEA can be made up by the quart or half-gallon and stored in the refrigerator if desired.  The inclusion of a small amount of lemon juice is best because the natural acidity in the lemon juice helps to free the active alkaloids in the tea from the tannins contained in it. This causes the alkaloids to be more easily assimilated by the body and therefore more utilized as well. Do not add more lemon juice than what is necessary as the taste can become too tart--a little is all you need.</p>

No. 16 (10/92)
<H1>LEARNING DISABILITIES</H1>
	Parents are often worried and disappointed when their child has learning problems.  There are many reasons for school failure, but a common one is a specific learning disability.  A child with a learning disability is usually bright and initially tries very hard to follow instructions, concentrate and "be good" at home and in school.  Yet despite this effort he or she is not mastering school tasks and falls behind.  Some learning disabled children also have trouble sitting still or paying attention.  Learning disabilities affect as many as 15 percent of otherwise able schoolchildren.<P>

	It is believed that learning disabilities are caused by a difficulty with the nervous system that affects receiving, processing or communicating information.  Some learning disabled children are also hyperactive and/or distractible with a short attention span.<P>

	Child and adolescent psychiatrists point out that learning disabilities are treatable, but if not detected and treated early, they can have a tragic "snowballing" effect.  For instance, a child who does not learn addition in elementary school cannot understand algebra in high school.  The child, trying very hard to learn, becomes more and more frustrated, and develops emotional problems such as low self-esteem in the face of repeated failure.  Some learning disabled children misbehave in school because they would rather be seen as "bad" than "stupid". <P>

	Parents should be aware of the most frequent signals of learning disabilities, when a child:
<UL>
<LI>Has difficulty understanding and following instructions. 
<LI>Has trouble remembering what someone just told him or her.
<LI>Fails to master reading, writing, and/or math skills, and thus fails schoolwork.
<LI>Has difficulty distinguishing right from left--for example, confusing 25 with 52, "b" with "d," or "on" with "no."
<LI>Lacks coordination--in walking, sports, or small activities such as holding a pencil or tying a shoelace.
<LI>Easily loses or misplaces homework, schoolbooks or other items.
<LI>Cannot understand the concept of time;  is confused by "yesterday," "today," "tomorrow."
</UL>
	Such problems deserve an evaluation by an expert on the whole child and his or her health and mental health.  A child and adolescent psychiatrist will work with the school professionals and others to have the necessary comprehensive evaluation and educational testing done to clarify if a learning disability exists.  After talking with the child and family, evaluating their situation, reviewing the educational testing and consulting with the school, the child and adolescent psychiatrist will make recommendations on appropriate school placement, the need for special help such as special educational therapy or speech-language therapy and steps parents can take to assist their child in maximizing his or her learning potential.  Sometimes individual or family psychotherapy will be recommended, and sometimes medication will be prescribed for hyperactivity or distractibility.  It is important to strengthen the child's self-confidence, so vital for healthy development, and also help parents and other family members cope with the realities of living with learning disabilities. <P>

<H1>PROBLEMAS DE APPRENDIZAJE</H1>
<P>Los padres cuyos ni&ntilde;os tienen problemas acad&eacute;micos se sienten extremadamente preocupados y desilucionados. Los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes saben que hay muchas causas para los fracasos acad&eacute;micos y que una de las m&aacute;s comunes son los trastornos del aprendizaje. Un ni&ntilde;o con un trastorno del aprendizaje es por lo general un ni&ntilde;o inteligente, quien inicialmente trata de seguir las instrucciones, de concentrarse y de tener buen comportamiento en la casa y la escuela. Sin embargo, el ni&ntilde;o no domina las tareas escolares y comienza a rezagarse. Algunos de estos ni&ntilde;os tienen dificultad en permanecer quietos o prestar atenci&oacute;n. Los problemas de aprendizaje afectan a no menos de un 15% de la poblaci&oacute;n escolar.
<P>Se estima que los problemas espec&iacute;ficos de aprendizaje son causados por una dificultad del sistema nervioso que afecta la captaci&oacute;n, elaboraci&oacute;n o comunicaci&oacute;n de informaci&oacute;n. Algunos de estos ni&ntilde;os son hiperactivos y/o distraidos con un lapso de atenci&oacute;n corto.
<P>Los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes indican, que estos ni&ntilde;os pueden ser ayudados, pero que si su condici&oacute;n no se detecta y se trata a tiempo, el problema puede aumentar y complicarse r&aacute;pidamente. Un ni&ntilde;o que en la escuela elemental no aprende a sumar, al llegar a la escuela superior, no podr&aacute; entender algebra. El ni&ntilde;o que trata de aprender con gran esfuerzo se frustrar&aacute; progresivamente y desarrollar&aacute; problemas emocionales como una pobre autoestima, resultado de los fracasos repetidos. Algunos ni&ntilde;os con problemas de aprendizaje pueden presentar tambi&eacute;n problemas de conducta, ya que prefieren lucir &quot;malos&quot; en vez de &quot;est&uacute;pidos o brutos&quot;.  Los padres deben de conocer las se&ntilde;ales que con mayor frecuencia indican problemas de aprendizaje en su ni&ntilde;o.

<OL>
<LI>Dificultad en atender o seguir instrucciones.
<LI>Dificultad para recordar lo que se le acaba de decir.
<LI>Fracasos acad&eacute;micos como consecuencia del poco dominio de destrezas de la lectura, escritura y/o aritm&eacute;tica.
<LI>Dificultad en distinguir entre la derecha y la izquierda, por ejemplo, confunde 25 con 52, la &quot;b&quot; con la &quot;d&quot; o, &quot;la&quot; por &quot;al&quot; u, &quot;on&quot; por &quot;no&quot;.
<LI>Defectos en coordinaci&oacute;n - cuando camina, en los deportes, en actividades manuales sencillas como sostener un l&aacute;piz, amarrarse los zapatos o hacer un lazo.
<LI>Pierde o se extrav&iacute;an sus asignaciones, sus libros, libretas y otros materiales.
<LI>No puede aprender los conceptos de tiempo; confunde &quot;ayer&quot;, &quot;hoy&quot;, &quot;ma&ntilde;ana&quot;.
</OL>

<P>Muchos padres solicitan un Psiquiatra de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes cuando su hijo presenta problemas iguales o parecidos a los arriba mencionados. El psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes trabajar&aacute; en colaboraci&oacute;n con los educadores y otro personal de la escuela, para hacer pruebas que puedan detectar la raz&oacute;n de la dificultad en el aprovechamiento y la presencia de problemas espec&iacute;ficos de aprendizaje. Luego de entrevistar al ni&ntilde;o y la familia, y de evaluar la situaci&oacute;n, el psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes har&aacute; recomendaciones relacionadas con la ubicaci&oacute;n escolar apropiada para el ni&ntilde;o, la necesidad de ayudas especiales, como terapia acad&eacute;mica, ocupacional, del habla y tomar&aacute; las medidas necesarias para ayudar a que el ni&ntilde;o desarrolle al m&aacute;ximo su potencial.
<P>En ocasiones el psiquiatra recetar&aacute; medicamentos cuando es necesario controlar su hperactividad y/o distraibilidad. Trabajar&aacute; con el ni&ntilde;o en el fortalecimiento de su confianza en s&iacute; mismo, elemento esencial para el desarrollo emotional saludable. Ayudar&aacute; tambi&eacute;n a los padres y otros miembros de la familia para enfrentarse a la realidad de vivir con un nine con problemas espec&iacute;ficos de aprendizaje.

 No. 35 (10/92)  
<H1>TIC DISORDERS</H1> 

	A tic is a problem in which a part of the body moves repeatedly, quickly, suddenly and uncontrollably.  Tics can occur in any body part, such as the face, hands or legs.  They can be stopped voluntarily for brief periods.  Sounds that are made involuntarily are called vocal tics.  Most tics are mild and hardly noticeable.  However, in some cases they are frequent and severe, and can affect many areas of a child's life. <P>

	The most common tic disorder is called "transient tic disorder," which may affect up to 10 percent of children during the early school years.  Teachers or others may notice the tics and wonder if the child is under stress or "nervous."  Transient tics go away by themselves. <P>

	Some tics do not go away.  Tics which last one year or more are called "chronic tics."  Chronic tics affect less than one percent of children and may be related to a special, more unusual tic disorder called Tourette's Disorder. <P>

	Children with Tourette's Disorder have both body and vocal tics.  Some tics disappear by early adulthood, and some continue.  Children with Tourette's Disorder may have problems with attention and concentration.  They may act impulsively, or they may develop obsessions and compulsions. <P>

	Sometimes people with Tourette's Disorder may blurt out obscene words, insult others, or make obscene gestures or movements.  They cannot control these sounds and movements and should not be blamed for them.  Punishment by parents, teasing by classmates, and scolding by teachers will not help the child to control the tics but will hurt the child's self-esteem. <P>

	Through a comprehensive medical evaluation, often involving pediatric and neurologic consultation, a child and adolescent psychiatrist can determine whether a youngster has Tourette's Disorder or another tic disorder.  Treatment for the child with a tic disorder may include medication to help control the symptoms.  The child and adolescent psychiatrist can also advise the family about how to provide emotional support and the appropriate educational environment for the youngster. <P>

	Further information about Tourette's Disorder is available from The Tourette Syndrome Association, Inc., 42-40 Bell Boulevard, Bayside, NY  11361-2861, (718) 224- 2999. <P>

<H1>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS AND HIV/AIDS </H1>
	Today adolescents of both sexes face a serious risk of HIV infection, which causes AIDS, which leads to death.  When adolescents take certain risks, they are more likely to become infected. These are the most important facts about AIDS:
<UL>
<LI>AIDs is fatal.
<LI>Teens get AIDS.
<LI>Condoms prevent AIDS.
<LI>You can get AIDS from use of even one contaminated needle or one sexual act with a partner who has HIV/AIDS. 
</UL>

Risk of AIDS is increased by:
<UL>
<LI>An increased number of sexual partners.
<LI>IV drug use; tattoos.
<LI>Anal intercourse.
<LI>Any sex (oral, anal or vaginal) without condoms.
<LI>Alcohol and other drug use (sex is more impulsive and use of condoms less likely if under the influence of alcohol or other drugs). 
</UL>

	AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is a chronic illness caused by infection with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).  As many as 1.5 million Americans are believed to be infected with HIV.  Some of them have AIDS, but most have no symptoms at all, and many do not know they are infected.  There are medical treatments for HIV infection, but so far there are no cures and no vaccines.<P>

	HIV is transmitted through exchange of certain bodily fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk.  To produce an infection, the virus must pass through the skin or mucous membranes into the body.<P>

	HIV infection is preventable.  Knowledge about HIV is an important aspect of prevention.  Parents should educate their children and also work closely with schools, churches, youth organizations, and health care professionals to ensure that children and teens receive sex education and preventive drug abuse courses which include material on HIV.<P>

	The HIV virus dies quickly when it is outside the human body.  It cannot be transmitted by day-to-day or even close social contacts not mentioned above.  Family members of an HIV-infected individual do not catch the virus if they share drinking glasses with the patient.  There is no known instance in which an HIV-infected child has passed the virus to another child in school.<P>

	HIV infection occurs in all age groups.  20% to 40% of the babies born to HIV- infected mothers develop HIV infection themselves.  Many of these children die within one or two years, but some live for years, although their development is slowed and they can get many infections.<P>

	If a child shows signs of drug abuse or premature sexual activity, these are reasons for immediate medical inquiry and intervention.  Evaluation by a child and adolescent psychiatrist can be an important first step in helping a family respond effectively to high risk behaviors in their children and adolescents.<P>

<H1>LEAD EXPOSURE IN CHILDREN AFFECTS BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR</H1>
 
	Lead exposure is one of the most common preventable poisonings of childhood.  It is estimated that one out of every six children in the United States, or a total of over three million children, have blood levels in the toxic range.  Lead is a potent poison that can affect individuals at any age.  Children with developing bodies are especially vulnerable because their rapidly developing nervous systems are particularly sensitive to the effects of lead.<P>

	Almost all children in the United States are exposed to lead.  Common sources include lead paint and lead contained in water and soil.  Over 50 million homes, including a majority of those built before 1980, contain lead-based paint.<P>

	Exposure to lead can have a wide range of effects on a child's development and behavior.  Even when exposed to small amounts of lead levels, children may appear inattentive, hyperactive and irritable.  Children with greater lead levels may also have problems with learning and reading, delayed growth and hearing loss.  At high levels, lead can cause permanent brain damage and even death.<P>

	Parents should make sure that their homes are free of lead paint and that the lead level in their drinking water is acceptably low.  The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that all children be screened for exposure to lead.  A simple and inexpensive blood test all can determine whether or not a child has a dangerous level of lead in his or her body.  The test can be obtained through a physician, or public health agency.<P>

	Early identification and treatment of lead poisoning reduces the risk that children will suffer permanent damage.  Treatment begins with removal of the child from the sources of the lead.  Medications can remove lead from the body.<P>

	For more information about lead poisoning, contact your physician, county or state Department of Health, or the Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E., Suite 100, Washington, D.C. (202) 543-1147.<P>

 No. 15 (10/92)
<H1>THE ADOPTED CHILD</H1> 

	Parents with an adopted child wonder whether, when and how to tell their child that he or she is adopted.  They also want to know if there are special problems for an adopted child. <P>

	Child and adolescent psychiatrists recommend that the child be told about the adoption by the adoptive parents.  Children should be told about their adoption in a way that they can understand. <P>

	There are two different views on when a child should be told about the adoption.  Many experts believe the child should be told at the earliest age possible.  This approach provides the child an early opportunity to accept and integrate the concept of being "adopted."  Other experts believe that telling a child too early may confuse the young child who can't really understand the event.  These experts advise waiting until the child is older. <P>

	In either case, children should learn of their adoption from the adoptive parents.  This helps give the message that adoption is good and that the child can trust the parents.  If the child first learns about the adoption intentionally or accidentally from someone other than parents, the child may feel anger and mistrust towards the parents, and may view the adoption as bad or shameful because it was kept a secret. <P>

	Adopted children will want to talk about their adoption and parents should encourage this process. Several excellent children's story books are available in bookstores which help parents tell the child about being adopted.<P>

	Children have a variety of responses to the knowledge that they are adopted.  Their feelings and responses depend on their age and level of maturity.  The child may deny the adoption or create fantasies about it.  Frequently, adopted children hold onto beliefs that they were given away for being bad or may believe that they were kidnapped.  If the parents talk openly about the adoption and present it in a positive manner, these worries are less likely to develop.<P>

	All adolescents go through a stage of struggling with their identity--wondering how they fit with their family, their peers, and the rest of the world.  The adopted adolescent is likely to have an increased interest in his or her birth parents during this stage.  This open curiosity is not unusual and does not mean that he or she is rejecting the adoptive parents.  Some adolescents may wish to learn the identity of their birth parents.  Adoptive parents can respond by letting the adolescent know it is okay to have this wish.  The adolescent who asks should usually be given, with tact and supportive discussion, information about the birth family.<P>

	The adoptive child may develop emotional or behavioral problems.  The problems may or may not result from insecurities or issues related to being adopted.  If parents are concerned they should seek professional assistance.  A child and adolescent psychiatrist can help the child and adoptive parents determine whether or not help is needed. <P>

	All children experience anxiety.  Anxiety in children is expected and       normal at specific times in development.  For example, from approximately       age 7 months through the preschool years, healthy youngsters may show       intense distress (anxiety) at times of separation from their parents or other       persons with whom they are close.  Young children may have short-lived       fears, (such as fear of the dark, storms, animals or strangers).  However,       when anxieties become severe and begin to interfere with the daily activities of childhood, such as separating from parents, attending school and making       friends, parents should consider seeking the evaluation and advice of a child       and adolescent psychiatrist.  A child or adolescent with severe separation anxiety may show some of the following:  
<UL>
<LI>constant thoughts and fears about safety of self and parents, 
<LI>refusing to go to school, 
<LI>frequent stomachaches and other physical complaints,    
<LI>extreme worries about sleeping away from home,
<LI>overly clingy behavior at home,
<LI>panic or tantrums at times of separation from parents.
</UL>

Some anxious children are afraid to meet or talk to new people.  Children with  this difficulty may have few friends outside the family.  Other children with severe anxiety may have:         
<UL>
<LI>many worries about things before they happen,         
<LI>constant worries or concern about school, friends or sports.
</UL>	

Anxious children are often overly tense or uptight.  Some may seek a lot of reassurance, and their worries may interfere with activities.  Because anxious children may also be quiet, compliant and eager to please, their difficulties may be missed.  Parents should be alert to the signs of severe anxiety so they can intervene early to prevent complications.  Early treatment can prevent future difficulties, such as, loss of friendships, failure to reach social and academic potential, and feelings of low self-esteem.  Severe anxiety problems in children can be treated.  Treatments may include a combination of the following:  individual psychotherapy, family therapy, medications, behavioral treatments, and consultation to the school.     <P>

<H1>THE AUTISTIC CHILD</H1>

	When an infant or toddler does not cuddle, make eye contact or respond to affection and touching, parents are seriously concerned.  This lack of responsiveness may be accompanied by an inability to communicate, and by a persistent failure to develop two-way social relationships in any situation.  Many autistic children fail to show a preference for parents over other adults and do not develop friendships with other children.  The language skills may be poor, even nonexistent. Language skills as well as facial expressions and gestures are not used in a communicative manner. When a child shows these symptoms, "infantile autism" is one of the diagnoses that the child and adolescent psychiatrist will consider.<P>

	The autistic child's relationship to objects is not normal.  The child may show unusual, extreme responses to objects--either avoidance or preoccupation.  For example, the autistic child whose bed is moved from one side of the room to another may scream.  Moving objects such as a fan hold great fascination, and the child may form an unusual attachment to odd objects such as a paper, rubber band or brick.<P>

	Another feature of autism is a tendency toward repetitive activities of a restrictive range. Spinning and rhythmic body movements such as arm flapping may occur.  High functioning autistic children may repeat television commercials or indulge in complex bedtime rituals.<P>

	Parents who suspect autism in their child should ask their family doctor or pediatrician to refer them to a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who can accurately diagnose the autism and the degree of severity, and determine the appropriate educational measures.  Autism is a disease;autistic children may have a serious lifelong disability.  However, with appropriate treatment and training, some autistic children can develop certain aspects of independence in their lives.  Parents should support their autistic children in developing those skills that use their strengths so they will feel good about themselves.<P>

	In addition to working with the autistic child, the child and adolescent psychiatrist can help the family resolve stress--for example, a feeling among the siblings that they are being neglected in favor of the autistic child, or embarrassment about bringing their friends home.  The child and adolescent psychiatrist can help parents with the emotional problems that may arise as a result of living with an autistic child and also help them provide the best possible nurturing and learning environment for the child.<P>

<H1>BEDWETTING </H1>
	Most children begin to stay dry at night around three years of age.  When a child has a problem with bedwetting (enuresis) after that age, parents may become concerned.<P>
	Physicians stress that enuresis is not a disease but a symptom--and a fairly common one.  Occasional accidents may occur, particularly when the child is ill.  Here are some facts parents should know about bedwetting:
<UL>
<LI>Approximately 15 percent of children wet the bed after the age of three.
<LI>Many more boys than girls wet their beds.
<LI>Bedwetting may run in families. 
<LI>Usually bedwetting stops by puberty.
</UL>
	Persistent bedwetting beyond the age of three or four rarely signals a kidney or bladder problem.  Bedwetting may sometimes be related to a sleep disorder.  In most cases it is due to the development of the child's bladder control being slower than normal.  Bedwetting may be the result of the child's tensions and emotions that require attention. <P>

	There are a variety of emotional reasons for bedwetting.  For example, when a young child begins bedwetting after several months or years of dryness during the night, this may reflect new fears of insecurities.  This may follow an event which makes the child feel insecure--moving to a new town, the loss of a family member, or, especially, the arrival of a new baby in the home.  Sometimes bedwetting occurs after a period of dryness because the child's original toilet training was too stressful. <P>

	Parents should remember that children rarely wet on purpose, and usually feel ashamed about the incident.  Rather than make the child feel naughty or ashamed, parents need to encourage the child and show faith that he or she will soon be able to enjoy staying dry at night.  A pediatrician's advice is often very helpful. <P>

	In rare instances, the problem of bedwetting cannot be resolved by the parents, the family physician or the pediatrician.  Sometimes the child may also show symptoms of emotional problems--such as persistent sadness or irritability, or a change in eating or sleeping habits.  In these cases, parents may want to talk with a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who will evaluate physical and emotional problems that may be causing the bedwetting, and will work with the child and parents to resolve these problems. <P>

<H1>CHILD ABUSE - THE HIDDEN BRUISES</H1>

	The statistics on physical child abuse are alarming.  Of the estimated hundreds of thousands of children battered each year by a parent or close relative, thousands die.  For those who survive, the emotional trauma remains long after the external bruises have healed. Communities and the courts recognize that these emotional "hidden bruises" can be treated.<P>
	Often the severe emotional damage to abused children does not surface until adolescence or later, when many abused children become abusing parents.  An adult who was abused as a child has trouble establishing intimate personal relationships, with a tendency to see all other adults as potential abusers.  These men and women "cannot stand to be touched."  Without proper treatment, they can be damaged for life.<P>
	Children who have been abused may display:
<UL>
<LI>A poor self-image;
<LI>Inability to depend on, trust or love others;
<LI>Aggressive and disruptive--sometimes illegal--behavior;
<LI>Passive and withdrawn behavior; fear of entering into new relationships or activities;
<LI>School failure;
<LI>Serious drug and alcohol abuse.
</UL>	
The child and adolescent psychiatrist is able to treat the "whole child"--medical as well as psychological or emotional problems that have occurred as a result of the abuse.  The family can be helped to learn new ways of support and communicating with one another. Through treatment, the abused child begins to regain a sense of self-confidence and trust.<P>
	Battering is not the only kind of child abuse.  Many children are victims of neglect, or sexual or emotional abuse.  In all kinds of child abuse, the child and the family can benefit from the comprehensive evaluation and care of a child and adolescent psychiatrist.<P>

<H1>CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE</H1>

	Child sexual abuse has been reported up to 80,000 times a year, but the number of unreported instances is far greater, because the children are afraid to tell anyone what has happened, and the legal procedure for validating an episode is difficult.  The problem should be identified, the abuse stopped, and the child should receive professional help.  The long-term emotional and psychological damage can be devastating.<P>

	Child sexual abuse can take place within the family, by a parent, step-parent, sibling or other relative; or outside the home, for example, by a friend, neighbor, child care person, teacher or random molester.  However, when the sexual abuse has occurred, the child develops a variety of distressing feelings and thoughts.<P>

	No child is psychologically prepared to cope with repeated sexual stimulation.  Even a two or three year old, who cannot know the sexual activity is "wrong," will develop problems resulting from the inability to cope with the over stimulation.<P>

	The child of five or older who knows and cares for the abuser becomes trapped between affection or loyalty for the person, and the sense that the sexual activities are terribly wrong.  If the child tries to break away from the sexual relationship, the abuser may threaten the child with violence or loss of love.  When sexual abuse occurs within the family, the child may fear the anger, jealousy or shame of other family members, or be afraid the family will break up if the secret is told.<P>

	A child who is the victim of prolonged sexual abuse usually develops low self-esteem, a feeling of worthlessness and an abnormal perspective on sexuality.  The child may become withdrawn and mistrustful of adults, and can become suicidal.<P>

	Some children who have been sexually abused have difficulty relating  to others except on sexual terms.  Some sexually abused children become child abusers or prostitutes, or have other serious problems when they reach adulthood.<P>

	Often there are no physical signs of child abuse, or signs that only a physician can detect, such as changes in the genital or anal area.<P>

	The behavior of sexually abused children may include:

<UL>
<LI>Unusual interest in or avoidance of all things of a sexual nature.
<LI>Sleep problems, nightmares.
<LI>Depression or withdrawal from friends or family.
<LI>Seductiveness.
<LI>Statements that their bodies are dirty or damaged, or fear that there is something wrong with them in the genital area.
<LI>Refusal to go to school, delinquency.
<LI>Secretiveness.
<LI>Aspects of sexual molestation in drawings, games, fantasies.
<LI>Unusual aggressiveness.
<LI>Suicidal behavior.
<LI>Other severe behavior changes.
</UL>
	Child sexual abusers can make the child extremely fearful of telling, and only when a special effort has helped the child to feel safe, can the child talk freely.<P>
	
	If a child says that he or she has been molested, parents should stress that what happened was not the fault of the child.  Parents should seek a medical examination and psychiatric consultation.<P>

	These are some preventive measures that parents can take:
<UL>
<LI>Tell children that "if someone tries to touch your body and do things that make you feel 	funny, say NO to that person and tell me right away."
<LI>Teach children that respect does not mean blind obedience to adults and to authority--for example, don't tell children to "Always do everything the teacher or baby-sitter tells you to do."
<LI>Encourage professional prevention programs in the local school system.
</UL>	Professional evaluation and treatment as soon as possible for the sexually abused child and the family is the best way to overcome the risk that the child will develop serious problems as an adult.  The child and adolescent psychiatrist helps the child regain a sense of self-esteem and relieve feelings of guilt about the abuse; helps family members understand how to assist the child in overcoming the trauma; and, if the abuser is a member of the family, works to restore him or her to a healthy role in the family.<P>

<H1>THE CHILD WITH A LONG-TERM ILLNESS </H1>
	The child with a serious medical illness is at risk for developing associated psychological problems.  Unlike a child with a temporary sickness such as the flu, the child with a chronic illness must cope with knowing that the disease is here to stay and may even get worse.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists point out that almost all these children at first refuse to believe they are ill, and later feel guilt and anger. <P>

	The young child, unable to understand why the sickness has occurred, may assume it is a punishment for being "bad."  He or she may become angry with parents and doctors for not being able to cure the illness.  The youngster may react strongly against pampering, teasing, or other attention.  Uncomfortable treatments, and restrictions in diet and activity may make the child bitter and withdrawn. <P>

	A teenager with a long-term illness may feel pulled in opposite directions.  On the one hand, he or she must take care of the physical problem, requiring dependence on parents and doctors.  On the other hand, the adolescent wants to become independent and join his or her friends in various activities.  When a teenager with a long-term illness tries to decrease or stop taking the prescribed medication without consulting with the physician, this often shows a normal adolescent desire to take charge of one's own body. <P>

	Chronic illness may cause setbacks in school or avoidance of school.  This can increase the child's loneliness and feeling of being different from or behind other youngsters.  Parents who want to help their child in every way possible should respond not only to the child's illness, but also to his or her strengths.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists know that if overprotected, the boy or girl may not learn to socialize or may have difficulty separating from parents when it is time to be involved in school.  It is often helpful for the child to be in contact with others who have successfully adjusted to living with a chronic illness. <P>

	In their prolonged periods of hospitalization and/or rest at home, children may develop excellence in a hobby or special talent such as art, model airplanes or a foreign language.  They may also learn as much as about their illness as possible.  Such activities are psychologically healthy and should be encouraged. <P>

	Children with long-term illnesses are often treated by a team of medical specialists which may usefully include a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who can help the child and family develop psychologically healthy ways of living with the disease and its effects. <P>

<H1>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS AND HIV/AIDS </H1>
	Today adolescents of both sexes face a serious risk of HIV infection, which causes AIDS, which leads to death.  When adolescents take certain risks, they are more likely to become infected. These are the most important facts about AIDS:
<UL>
<LI>AIDs is fatal.
<LI>Teens get AIDS.
<LI>Condoms prevent AIDS.
<LI>You can get AIDS from use of even one contaminated needle or one sexual act with a partner who has HIV/AIDS. 
</UL>

Risk of AIDS is increased by:
<UL>
<LI>An increased number of sexual partners.
<LI>IV drug use; tattoos.
<LI>Anal intercourse.
<LI>Any sex (oral, anal or vaginal) without condoms.
<LI>Alcohol and other drug use (sex is more impulsive and use of condoms less likely if under the influence of alcohol or other drugs). 
</UL>

	AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is a chronic illness caused by infection with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).  As many as 1.5 million Americans are believed to be infected with HIV.  Some of them have AIDS, but most have no symptoms at all, and many do not know they are infected.  There are medical treatments for HIV infection, but so far there are no cures and no vaccines.<P>

	HIV is transmitted through exchange of certain bodily fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk.  To produce an infection, the virus must pass through the skin or mucous membranes into the body.<P>

	HIV infection is preventable.  Knowledge about HIV is an important aspect of prevention.  Parents should educate their children and also work closely with schools, churches, youth organizations, and health care professionals to ensure that children and teens receive sex education and preventive drug abuse courses which include material on HIV.<P>

	The HIV virus dies quickly when it is outside the human body.  It cannot be transmitted by day-to-day or even close social contacts not mentioned above.  Family members of an HIV-infected individual do not catch the virus if they share drinking glasses with the patient.  There is no known instance in which an HIV-infected child has passed the virus to another child in school.<P>

	HIV infection occurs in all age groups.  20% to 40% of the babies born to HIV- infected mothers develop HIV infection themselves.  Many of these children die within one or two years, but some live for years, although their development is slowed and they can get many infections.<P>

	If a child shows signs of drug abuse or premature sexual activity, these are reasons for immediate medical inquiry and intervention.  Evaluation by a child and adolescent psychiatrist can be an important first step in helping a family respond effectively to high risk behaviors in their children and adolescents.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN & DIVORCE</H1>

	Frequently parents who are getting a divorce are worried about the effect on their children.  These parents may be preoccupied with their own problems but still realize that they are the most important people in their children's lives.<P>
	While parents may be devastated or relieved by the divorce, children are invariably frightened and confused by the threat to their security.  Some parents feel so hurt or overwhelmed by the divorce that they may turn to the child for comfort or direction. Divorce can be misinterpreted by children unless parents tell them what is happening, how they are involved and not involved and what will happen to them.<P>
	Children often believe they have caused the conflict between their mother and father. Many children assume the responsibility for bringing their parents back together, sometimes by sacrificing themselves.  Vulnerability to both physical and mental illnesses can originate in the traumatic loss of one or both parents through divorce.  With care and attention, however, a family's strengths can be mobilized during a divorce, and children can be helped to deal constructively with the resolution of parental conflict.<P>
	Parents should be aware if there are signs of persistent stress in their child or children.  These may include loss of motivation for school, or for making friends or even for having fun.  Other warning signs include sleeping too much or too little, or being unusually rebellious and argumentative within the family.<P>
	Children need to know that their mother and father will still be their parents even though the marriage is ending and the parents won't live together.  Long custody disputes or pressure on a child to "choose sides" can be particularly harmful for the youngster and can add to the damage of the divorce.<P>
	Parents' ongoing commitment to the child's well-being is vital.  If a child shows signs of stress, the family doctor or pediatrician can refer the parents to a child and adolescent psychiatrist.  He or she can evaluate and treat the symptoms caused by stress.  In addition, the child and adolescent psychiatrist can meet with the parents to help them learn how to make the strain of the divorce easier on the entire family.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN AND FAMILY MOVES</H1>
	
	Moving to a new community may be one of the most stress-producing experiences a family faces.  Frequent moves or even a single move can be especially hard on a youngster, and this stress occurs even when there are siblings. <P>

	Moves interrupt friendships.  To a new child at school, it may at first seem that everyone else has a best friend or is securely involved in a clique.  The child must get used to a different curriculum, and finds him or herself ahead on certain subjects and behind on others, causing boredom and anxiety. <P>

	Children in kindergarten or first grade may be particularly vulnerable to a family move because developmentally they are just in the process of separating from their parents and adjusting to new authority figures and peer groups.  The relocation can interfere with that normal process of separation by causing them to return to a more dependent relationship with their parents. <P>

	In general, the older the child, the more difficulty he or she will have with the move because of the increasing importance of the peer group.  Pre-teens and teenagers may repeatedly protest the move, or ask to stay in their hometown with a friend's family.     Some youngsters may not talk about their distress, so parents should be aware of the warning signs of depression, including changes in appetite, withdrawal, a drop in grades, irritability, sleep disturbances or other dramatic changes in behavior. <P>

	Children who seem depressed by a move may be reacting less to the relocation than to the stress of their parents settling in to a new area.  Sometimes one parent may be against the move, and children will sense and react to this parental discord. <P>

	If the child shows persistent signs of depression or distress, parents can ask their family doctor, their pediatrician or the local medical society to refer them to a child and  adolescent psychiatrist, who can diagnose and treat physical as well as emotional problems that may affect children as a result of stress.  The child and adolescent psychiatrist can also help parents learn how to make the new experience easier on the entire family. <P>

	To make the move easier on children, parents may take these steps:  
<UL>
<LI>Explain clearly to the children why the move is necessary.  
<LI>Familiarize the children as much as possible with the new area with maps, photographs or the daily newspaper.  
<LI>Describe advantages of the new location that the child might appreciate such as a lake, mountain or an amusement park.  
<LI>After the move, get involved with the children in activities of the local church or synagogue, PTA, scouts, YMCA, etc.  
<LI>If a son or daughter is a senior in high school, consider the possibility of letting him or her stay with a trusted family until the school year is over. 
</UL>
	The more frequently a family moves, the more important is the need for internal stability.  With the proper attention from parents and professional help if necessary, moving can be a positive growth experience for children, leading to increased self-confidence and interpersonal skills.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN AND FIREARMS</H1> 

	Parents, professionals and many others are concerned about the increasing numbers of children and adolescents killed by firearms:
<UL>
<LI>Every day, 10 American children ages 18 and under are killed in handgun suicide,homicides and accidents.  Many more are wounded.  
<LI>Gunshot wounds to children ages 16 and under have increased 300 percent in majorurban areas since 1986.  
<LI>60 percent of teen deaths by suicide involve the use of a gun.  Nearly 3,000 teensuse handguns to commit suicide every year.   
<LI>An estimated 400,000 youngsters carried handguns to school in 1987.  In Baltimore,half the males reported having taken a gun to high school.  
<LI>At least 25 million American households keep handguns and 50% of owners keep them loaded. 
</UL>

	We cannot gun-proof our children and adolescents. Children are playful and active.  Adolescents are curious and impulsive.  Such healthy traits when mixed with guns can cause death. <P>

	The best way to protect children against gun violence is to remove all guns from the home.  If parents feel they must have one or more guns in the home, there will always be some dangers.  The following actions are crucial to lessen the dangers: 
<UL>
<LI>Store all firearms unloaded and uncocked in a securely locked container.  Only the parents should know where the container is located.  
<LI>Store the guns and ammunition in separate locked locations.   
<LI>For a revolver, place a padlock around the top strap of the weapon to prevent thecylinder from closing, or use a trigger lock;  for a pistol, use a trigger lock.   
<LI>When handling or cleaning a gun, never leave it unattended, even for a moment; it should be in your view at all times.
</UL>

	Even if parents don't own a gun, they should check with parents at other places where their children play, to make sure safety precautions are followed.  In a study of accidental handgun shootings of children under 16, nearly 40% of the shootings occurred in the homes of friends and relatives.  The tragedies occurred most often when children were left unsupervised. <P>

	When youngsters use alcohol and also have a gun available, the risk for violence rapidly increases.  In a youth suicide study, victims who used firearms were about five times more likely to have been drinking than those who used other means.  In a study of firearm- associated murders among family members, almost 90% of the offenders and victims had used alcohol or drugs before the killings. <P>

	The average American child witnesses 45 acts of violence on TV each day, most involving handguns.  Children often imitate what they see, and are more aggressive after extensive viewing of TV violence.  Parents should help protect their children from the effects of watching TV violence.  For example, they can watch with children; ration TV; and disapprove of the violent episodes in front of the children, stressing the belief that such behavior is not the best way to resolve a problem.<P>

	Children and adolescents with emotional or behavioral problems may be more likely than other children to use guns, against themselves or others.  Parents who are concerned that their child is too aggressive or might have an emotional disorder may wish to seek an evaluation by a child and adolescent psychiatrist.<P>

	More information about gun safety issues and guidelines is available from the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, 1225 "I" Street, N.W., Suite 1100, Washington, D.C. 20005. <P>

<H1>CHILDREN AND GRIEF</H1>

	When a family member dies, children react differently from adults.  Preschool children usually see death as temporary and reversible--a belief reinforced by cartoon characters who "die" and "come to life" again.  Children between five and nine begin to think more like adults about death, yet they still believe it will never happen to them or anyone they know.<P>

	Adding to a child's shock and confusion at the death of a brother, sister or parent is the unavailability of other family members, who may be so shaken by grief that they are notable to cope with the normal responsibility of child care.<P>

	Parents should be aware of normal childhood responses to a death in the family, as well as danger signals.  According to child and adolescent psychiatrists, it is normal during the weeks following the death for some children to feel immediate grief or persist in the belief that the family member is still alive.  But long-term denial of the death or avoidance of grief is unhealthy and can later surface in more severe problems.<P>

	A child who is frightened about attending a funeral should not be forced to go; however, some service or observance is recommended, such as lighting a candle, saying a prayer or visiting a grave site.<P>

	Once children accept the death, they are likely to display their feelings of sadness on and off over a long period of time, and often at unexpected moments.  The surviving relatives should spend as much time as possible with the child, making it clear that the child has permission to show his or her feelings openly or freely.<P>

	The person who has died was essential to the stability of the child's world, and anger is a natural reaction.  The anger may be revealed in boisterous play, nightmares, irritability or a variety of other behaviors.  Often the child will show anger towards the surviving family members.<P>

	After a parent dies, many children will act younger than they are.  The child may temporarily become more infantile, demanding food, attention and cuddling, and talking "baby talk."<P>

	Younger children believe they are the cause of what happens around them.  A young child may believe a parent, grandparent, brother or sister died because he or she had once "wished" the person dead.   The child feels guilty because the wish "came true."  Some danger signals to watch for:
<UL>
<LI>An extended period of depression in which the child loses interest in daily activities and events.
<LI>Inability to sleep, loss of appetite, prolonged fear of being alone.
<LI>Acting much younger for an extended period.
<LI>Excessively imitating the dead person; repeated statements of wanting to join the dead person.
<LI>Withdrawal from friends.
<LI>Sharp drop in school performance or refusal to attend school.
</UL>
	These warning signs indicate that professional help may be needed.  A child and adolescent psychiatrist can help the child accept the death and assist the survivors in helping the child through the mourning process.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN AND LYING</H1> 

	Honesty and dishonesty are learned in the home.  Parents are often concerned when their child or adolescent lies.<P>  

<H4>	Lying that is probably not a serious problem:</H4>
	Young children (ages 4-5) often make up stories and tell tall tales.  This is normal activity because they enjoy hearing stories and making up stories for fun.  These young children may blur the distinction between reality and fantasy.<P>

	An older child or adolescent may tell a lie to be self-serving (e.g. avoid doing something or deny responsibility for their actions).  Parents should respond to isolated instances of lying by talking with the youngster about the importance of truthfulness, honesty and trust.<P>

	Some adolescents discover that lying may be considered acceptable in certain situations such as not telling a boyfriend or girlfriend the real reasons for breaking up because they don't want to hurt their feelings.  Other adolescents may lie to protect their privacy or to help them feel psychologically separate and independent from their parents  (e.g. denying they sneaked out late at night with friends).<P>


<H4>	Lying that may indicate emotional problems:</H4>
	Some children, who know the difference between truthfulness and lying, tell elaborate stories which appear believable.  Children or adolescents usually relate these stories with enthusiasm because they receive a lot of attention as they tell the lie.<P>

	Other children or adolescents, who otherwise seem responsible, fall into a pattern of repetitive lying.  They often feel that lying is the easiest way to deal with the demands of parents, teachers and friends.  These children are usually not trying to be bad or malicious but the repetitive pattern of lying becomes a bad habit.<P>

	There are also some children and adolescents who are not bothered by lying or taking advantage of others.  Other adolescents may frequently use lying to cover up another serious problem.  For example, an adolescent with a serious drug or alcohol problem will lie repeatedly to hide the truth about where they have been, who they were with, what they were doing, and where the money went.<P>


<H4>	What to do if a Child or Adolescent lies:</H4>
	Parents are the most important role models for their children.  When a child or adolescent lies, parents should take some time to have a serious talk and discuss:
<UL>
<LI>The difference between make believe and reality, lying and telling the truth
<LI>The importance of honesty at home and in the community
<LI>Alternatives to lying
</UL>

	If a child or adolescent develops a pattern of lying which is serious and repetitive, then professional help may be indicated.  Evaluation by a child and adolescent psychiatrist would help the child and parents understand the lying behavior and would also provide recommendations for the future.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN & TV VIOLENCE</H1> 
	American children watch an average of three to fours hours of television daily.  Television can be a powerful influence in developing value systems and shaping behavior.  Unfortunately, much of today's television programming is violent.  Hundreds of studies of the effects of TV violence on children and teenagers have found that children may:
<UL>
<LI>Become "immune" to the horror of violence;
<LI>Gradually accept violence as a way to solve problems;
<LI>Imitate the violence they observe on television; and
<LI>Identify with certain characters, victims and/or victimizers:
</UL>
	Extensive viewing of television violence by children causes greater aggressiveness.  Sometimes, watching a single violent program can increase aggressiveness.  Children who view shows in which violence is very realistic, frequently repeated or unpunished, are more likely to imitate what they see.  The impact of TV violence may be immediately evident in the child's behavior or may surface years later, and young people can even be affected when the family atmosphere shows no tendency toward violence.<P>

	This does not mean that violence on television is the only source for aggressive or violent behavior, but it is a significant contributor.<P>

	Parents can protect children from excessive TV violence in the following ways:
<UL>
<LI>Pay attention to the programs their children are watching.  Watch some with them. 
<LI>Set limits on the amount of time they spend with the television. 
<LI>Point out that although the actor has not actually been hurt or killed, such violence in real life results in pain or death. 
<LI>Refuse to let the children see shows known to be violent, and change the channel or turn off the TV set when something offensive comes on, with an explanation of what is wrong with the program.
<LI>Disapprove of the violent episodes in front of the children, stressing the belief that such behavior is not the best way to resolve a problem. 
<LI>To offset peer pressure among friends and classmates, contact other    parents and agree to enforce similar rules about the length of time and type of program the children may watch. 
</UL>
	Parents should also use these measures to prevent harmful effects from television in other areas such as racial or sexual stereotyping.  The amount of time children watch TV, regardless of content, should be moderated, because it keeps children from other, more beneficial activities such as reading and playing with friends.  If parents have serious difficulties setting limits, or deep concerns about how their child is reacting to television, they should contact a child and adolescent psychiatrist for help defining the problem.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN OF ALCOHOLICS</H1> 
	At least seven million American children have alcoholic parents.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists know these children are at greater risk for having emotional problems than children whose parents are not alcoholics.  Alcoholism runs in families, and children of alcoholics are four times more likely than other children to become alcoholics.<P>
	A child in such a family may have a variety of problems: 
<UL>
<LI>Guilt. The child may see himself or herself as the main cause of the mother's or father's drinking.
<LI>Anxiety.  The child may worry constantly about the situation at home.  He or she is afraid the alcoholic parent will become sick or injured, and may also fear fights and violence between the parents. 
<LI>Embarrassment.  Parents may give the message that there is a terrible secret at home.  The ashamed child does not invite friends home and is afraid to ask anyone for help.
<LI>Inability to have close relationships.  Because the child has been disappointed by the drinking parent many times, he or she often does not trust others.
<LI>Confusion.  The alcoholic parent will change suddenly from being loving to angry, regardless of the child's behavior.  A regular daily schedule, which is very important for a child, does not exist because bedtimes and mealtimes are constantly changing. 
<LI>Anger.  The child feels anger at the alcoholic parent for drinking, and may be angry at the non-alcoholic parent for lack of support and protection.
<LI>Depression.  The child feels lonely and helpless to change the situation.
</UL>	     
	Although the child tries to keep the alcoholism a secret, teachers, relatives, other adults or friends may sense that something is wrong.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists advise that the following behaviors may signal a drinking problem at home: 
<UL>
<LI>Failure in school; truancy.
<LI>Lack of friends;  withdrawal from classmates. 
<LI>Delinquent behavior, such as stealing or violence.
<LI>Frequent physical complaints, such as headaches or stomachaches.
<LI>Abuse of drugs or alcohol.
<LI>Aggression towards other children. 
</UL>
	Some children of alcoholics may act like responsible "parents" within the family and among friends.  They may cope with the alcoholism by becoming controlled, successful "overachievers" throughout school, and at the same time be emotionally isolated from other children and teachers.  Their emotional problems may show only when they become adults. <P>

	Whether or not their parents are receiving treatment for alcoholism, these children and adolescents can benefit from educational programs and mutual-help groups such as programs for children of alcoholics, Al-Anon and Alateen.  Professional help, the earlier the better, is also important in preventing more serious problems for the child, including alcoholism.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists help these children with their own problems, and also help them to understand they are not responsible for the drinking problems of their parents. <P>

	The treatment program may include group therapy with other youngsters, which reduces the isolation of being a child of an alcoholic.  The child and adolescent psychiatrist will often work with the entire family--particularly when the alcoholic parent has stopped drinking--to help them develop healthier ways of relating to one another. <P>

<H1>CHILDREN OF PARENTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS</H1> 
	Mental illnesses in parents represent a risk for children in the family.  These children have a higher risk for developing mental illnesses than other children. <P>

	The risk is particularly strong when the parent's illness is manic-depressive illness, schizophrenia, alcoholism or other drug abuse, or major depression.  When both parents are mentally ill, the chance is even greater that the child might become mentally ill.<P>

	Risk can be inherited from parents, through the genes.  Some of the risk also comes from parents' behavior or moods.  Mental disorders can keep parents from providing the love and guidance necessary for a child's healthy development.  An inconsistent, unpredictable family environment contributes to psychiatric illness in children.  Mental illness can hurt the marriage and the parenting  abilities of the couple, which in turn hurts the child. <P>

	Some protective or positive things can decrease the risk to children, including:
<UL>
<LI>Children knowing their parents are ill and that the children are not to blame. 
<LI>A stable home environment. 
<LI>A sense of being loved by the ill parent. 
<LI>A naturally stable and happy personality in the child.
<LI>Inner strength and good coping skills in the child. 
<LI>A strong relationship with a healthy adult. 
<LI>Friends.
<LI>Interest in and success at school.
<LI>Other outside interests for the child.
<LI>Help from outside the family to improve the family environment (for example, marital psychotherapy, or a class in parenting). 
</UL>

	Medical, mental health or social service professionals working with mentally ill adults need to inquire about the children and adolescents, especially about their mental health and emotional development.  It is often useful for such youngsters to be referred to a child and adolescent psychiatrist for an evaluation. <P>

	Individual or family psychiatric treatment can help a child toward healthy development despite the problem of the parental psychiatric illness.  The child and adolescent psychiatrist can help the family work with the positive elements in the home and the natural strengths of the child.  With treatment, the family can learn ways to lessen the effects of the parent's mental illness on the child. <P>

	Unfortunately, families, professionals and society often pay most attention to the mentally ill parent, and ignore the children in the family.  Providing more attention and support to the children of a psychiatrically ill parent is an important way to help prevent mental illnesses from passing from one generation to the next.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN WHO CAN'T PAY ATTENTION</H1>

	Parents are distressed to receive a note from school saying that their child "won't listen to the teacher" or "causes trouble in class."  One possible reason for this kind of behavior is Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).<P>
	Even though the child with ADHD often wants to be a good student, the impulsive behavior and inability to pay proper attention in class interfere.  Teachers, parents and friends know that the child is "misbehaving" or "different," but they might not be able to tell exactly what is wrong.  A child and adolescent psychiatrist can diagnose and treat the child with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.<P>
	The "hyperactivity" symptoms in ADHD may include excessive running or climbing in young children, or extremely restless and fidgety behavior in older children.  In contrast to a normal high level of activity in some children, hyperactivity is haphazard, poorly organized and not goal-directed.  ADHD is ten times more common in boys than in girls.<P>
	A child who has ADHD shows several of the following characteristics:
<UL>
<LI>Has difficulty organizing work and gives the impression he or she has not heard instructions.
<LI>Is easily distracted.
<LI>Makes careless, impulsive errors.
<LI>Frequently calls out in class.
<LI>Has difficulty awaiting his or her turn in group situations.
<LI>Fails to follow through on parents' requests.
<LI>Is unable to play games for the same amount of time as other children of the same age.
</UL>

	Without proper treatment, the child may fall behind in schoolwork, and friendships may suffer because of poor cooperation in playing and other social activities.  Self-esteem suffers because the child experiences more failure than success and is criticized by teachers and family who do not recognize a health problem.<P>

	Research clearly documents that medication can be helpful, and that medication prescribed for ADHD works best as part of a comprehensive plan of treatment including ongoing evaluation and, often, medical psychotherapy for the child, help for the family, and consultation with teachers.<P>

	If a child shows behavior problems like those of ADHD, parents may ask their pediatrician or family physician to refer them to a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who can diagnose and treat the child for this illness.  By meeting with the child and adolescent psychiatrist, parents can learn how to cope with their child's problem.  In addition, the child psychiatrist often helps teachers and school officials work out ways to teach more effectively those children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN WHO STEAL</H1> 

	When a child or teenager steals, parents are naturally concerned.  They worry about what caused their child to steal, and they wonder whether their son or daughter is a "juvenile delinquent."<P>

	It is normal for a very young child to take something which excites interest.  This cannot be regarded as stealing until the youngster is old enough--usually three to five--to understand that something belongs to a particular person.  Parents should actively teach their children about property rights and the consideration of others.<P>

	Although they have learned that theft is wrong, older children or teenagers steal for various reasons.  A youngster may steal to make things equal if a brother or sister seems to be favored with affection or gifts.  Sometimes, a child may steal as a show of bravery to friends, or to give presents and become more popular at school.<P>

	Parents should consider whether the child has stolen out of a need for more attention.  In such cases, the child may be expressing anger or trying to "get even" with the parents; the stolen object may become a substitute for affection.  The parents should make an effort to give more recognition to the child as an important family member.<P>

	If parents take the proper measures, in most cases the stealing stops as the child grows older.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists recommend that when parents find out their child has stolen, they:
<UL>
<LI>Tell the child that stealing is wrong.
<LI>Help the youngster to pay for or return the stolen object.
<LI>Make sure that the child does not benefit from the theft under any circumstances.
<LI>Avoid lecturing, predicting future bad behavior or saying that they now consider the child to be a thief.
<LI>Make clear that this behavior is totally unacceptable within the family tradition and the community. 
</UL>
	When the child has paid for or returned the stolen merchandise, the matter should not be brought up again by the parents, so that the child can begin again with a "clean slate."<P>

	If stealing is persistent and thefts continue despite these measures, the stealing probably results from more serious problems in the child's emotional development.  Children who repeatedly steal have difficulty trusting others and forming close relationships.  Rather than feeling guilty, they blame the behavior on others, with the argument that, "Since they refuse to give me what I need, I will take it."  Some children steal out of a fear of dependency; they wish not to depend on anyone, so they take what they need.<P>

	In treating a child who steals persistently, a child and adolescent psychiatrist will diagnose the underlying reasons for the need to steal, and plan a program of treatment.  Important aspects of treatment are helping the child learn to establish trusting relationships and helping the family to support the child in changing to a more healthy path of development.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN WHO WON'T GO TO SCHOOL</H1>
	Going to school usually is an exciting, enjoyable event for young children.  For some it brings fear or panic.  Parents have cause for concern when their child regularly feels sick from tension, "plays sick" or with minor physical complaints wishes to stay home from school.  Often the child five to ten years of age who behaves this way is suffering from a paralyzing fear of leaving the safety of parents and home.  The child's panic is very difficult for parents to cope with, but these fears can be treated successfully, with professional help.<P>

	The first appearance of unreasonable fear of school is typically in nursery school, kindergarten or first grade, and it peaks in second grade.  The child may complain of a headache, sore throat, or stomach-ache shortly before it is time to leave for school.  The "illness"  subsides after the child is allowed to stay home, only to reappear the next morning before school.  In some cases the child may simply refuse to leave the house.<P>

	Refusal to go to school often begins following a period at home which the child has become closer to the mother, such as a summer vacation, a holiday break or a brief illness.  It also may follow a stressful occurrence, such as the death of a pet or relative, a change in schools or a move to a new neighborhood.<P>

	Children with an unreasonable fear of school may feel unsafe staying in a room by themselves and may display clinging behavior, shadowing the mother or father around the house. Such fears are common among children with separation Anxiety Disorder.  They often have difficulty going to sleep, and they may show exaggerated, unrealistic fears of animals, monsters, burglars or being alone in the dark.<P>

	The potential long-term effects are serious for a child who has persistent fears and does not receive professional assistance.  The child may develop serious educational or social problems if away from school and friends for an extended period.<P>

	The parents and child can benefit from seeing a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who will work with them in an effort immediately to return the child to school and other important daily activities.  Since the panic comes from leaving home rather than being in school, frequently the child is calm once in school.<P>

	For some children, the more fundamental causes of fears will need to be treated at greater length.  Refusal to go to school in the older child or adolescent is generally a more serious illness, and often requires more intensive treatment.<P>

	In any case, unreasonable fears about leaving the home and parents can be successfully treated, and parents should not hesitate to seek professional help.  The child's physician can refer the parents to a child and adolescent psychiatrist.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN'S MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS</H1> 

	A child with a "major psychiatric disorder" has a very serious illness affecting several areas of the child's life.  These areas may include emotions, social or intellectual ability, or the use of language.  Children with major psychiatric disorders may also have physical problems or may also be mentally retarded. <P>

	When a child and adolescent psychiatrist examines a child to learn if he or she has a major psychiatric disorder, these are some of the signs they look for or ask parents about: 
<UL>
<LI>Failure to look or smile at parents or other care givers;
<LI>Very strange actions or appearance;
<LI>Lack of movement or facial expression;
<LI>Lack of interest in or awareness of other people;
<LI>Odd way of speaking, or private language that no one else can understand;
<LI>Strange conversations with him- or herself;
<LI>Odd or repetitive movements, such as spinning, hand-flapping, or headbanging; and
<LI>Panic in response to a change in surroundings.  
</UL>

	There are many different kinds of major psychiatric disorders.  The specific name given to a child's illness will depend upon the combination of symptoms listed above, and on how severe the illness is. <P>

	Major psychiatric disorders often last a long time, and may be lifelong.  However, when children with these disorders begin treatment early, their health and ability to perform everyday tasks will usually improve. <P>

	When parents are concerned that their child may have a major psychiatric disorder, they should seek a comprehensive evaluation as soon as possible.  Observant parents, pediatricians, teachers and others who see the child regularly can compare the child with others in his or her age group.  Their observations are very helpful in the formation of an initial assessment of the child's problem. <P>

	A comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan will then involve a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who coordinates his or her own findings with those of parents, special educators, pediatricians, neurologists and developmental and psychological tests. <P>

	Comprehensive treatment will involve coordinating several of the following:
<UL>
<LI>Psychotherapy;
<LI>Specific learning programs;
<LI>Specific social skill and behavior programs;
<LI>Psychiatric medication;
<LI>Special schools or hospitals; and 
<LI>Active involvement by the family.  
</UL>

	Perhaps because children change so much as they grow, diagnosis of major psychiatric disorders in youngsters is one of the most difficult areas of medicine.  Thus, it is extremely important that physicians with adequate training and experience be involved in helping the child, and that parents seek help as soon as they begin to be worried about their child.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN'S SLEEP PROBLEMS</H1> 

	Many children have sleep problems.  Examples include frequent awakening during the night, talking during sleep, difficulty falling asleep, waking up crying, feeling sleepy during the day, or having nightmares.  Bedwetting is another nighttime problem.*<P>

	Most childhood sleep problems are related to irregular sleep habits or to anxiety about going to bed and falling asleep.  Sleep problems may also be symptoms of emotional difficulties.  "Separation anxiety" is a developmental landmark for young children.  For normal young children, bedtime is a time of separation:  Some children will do all they can to prevent separation. <P>

	To help minimize these types of common sleep problems, child and adolescent psychiatrists recommend that parents be consistent.  They should view sleep as a useful habit and develop regular routines. <P>

	Parents often find that feeding and rocking help an infant to get to sleep.  However, as the child leaves infancy, parents should encourage the child to sleep without feeding and rocking.  Otherwise, the developing child will have a hard time going to sleep alone. <P>

	Nightmares are relatively common.  The child remembers nightmares, which usually involve major threats to the child's well-being.  Nightmares, which being at a variety of ages, affect girls more often than boys.  For some, nightmares are serious and frequent. <P>

	Sleep terrors, sleepwalking and sleep talking constitute a relatively rare group of sleep disorders, called "parasomnias." <P>

	Sleep terrors are different from nightmares.  The child with sleep terrors will scream uncontrollably and appear to be awake, but is confused and can't communicate.  Sleep terrors usually begin between ages 4 and 12.     * See Facts For Families, no. 18 on "Bedwetting". <P>

	Children who sleepwalk may appear to be awake as they move around, but are actually asleep and in danger of hurting themselves.  Sleepwalking usually begins between ages 6 and 12.  Both sleep terrors and sleepwalking run in families and affect boys more often than girls. <P>

	Most often, children with parasomnias have single or occasional episodes of these disorders.  However, when episodes occur several times a night, or nightly for weeks at a time, or interfere with the child's daytime behavior, treatment by a child and adolescent psychiatrist may be necessary.  A range of treatments is available. <P>

	Fortunately, as they mature, children usually get over common sleep problems as well as the more serious disorders.  However, parents with urgent concerns should contact their pediatrician or directly seek consultation with a child and adolescent psychiatrist. <P>

<H1>CONDUCT DISORDERS</H1> 

	"Conduct disorders" are a complicated group of behavioral and emotional problems in youngsters.  Children and adolescents with these disorders have great difficulty following rules and behaving in a socially acceptable way.  They are often viewed by other children, adults and social agencies as "bad" or delinquent, rather than mentally ill.<P>

	Their expression of anger is the major problem.  They are often aggressive, both physically and verbally, with other children and to adults.  They may lie, steal, destroy property and misbehave sexually.<P>

	Research shows that the future of these youngsters is likely to be very unhappy if they and their families do not receive early, ongoing and comprehensive treatment.  Without treatment, many youngsters with conduct disorders are unable to adapt to the demands of adulthood and continue to have problems with relationships and holding a job.  They often break laws or behave antisocially.  Many children with a conduct disorder may be diagnosed as also having a coexisting depression or an attention deficit disorder. <P>

	Many factors may lead to a child developing conduct disorders, including brain damage, child abuse, defects in growth, school failure and negative family and social experiences.  The child's "bad" behavior causes a negative reaction from others, which makes the child behave even worse. <P>

	Treatment of children with conduct disorders is difficult because the causes of the illness are complex and each youngster is unique.  Adding to the challenge of treatment are the child's uncooperative attitude, fear and distrust of adults.<P>

	A child and adolescent psychiatrist uses information from other medical specialists, and from the child, family and teachers to understand the causes of the disorder and then organize a comprehensive treatment plan.<P>

	Behavior therapy and psychotherapy are usually necessary to help the child appropriately express and control anger.  Remedial education may be needed for youngsters with learning disabilities.  Parents often need expert assistance in devising and carrying out special management and educational programs in the home and at school.  Treatment may also include medication in some youngsters, such as those with difficulty paying attention and controlling movement or those having an associated depression. <P>

	Treatment is rarely brief since establishing new attitudes and behavior patterns takes time.  However, treatment offers a good chance for considerable improvement in the present and hope for a more successful future.<P>

No. 42 (10/92)  
<H1>THE CONTINUUM OF CARE</H1>

	 Communities provide different types of treatment programs and services for children and adolescents with mental illnesses.  A complete range of programs and services is called the continuum of care.  Not every community has every type of program on the continuum.<P>

	  When parents are concerned about their child's behavior or emotions they should start with an evaluation by a qualified mental health professional such as a child and adolescent psychiatrist.  At the conclusion of the evaluation, the professional will recommend a certain type of program from the continuum available in the community.<P>

	  Each of the programs on the continuum offers several forms of treatment, such as individual psychotherapy, family therapy, group therapy and medications.<P>

	  A brief description of the different programs on the continuum of care follows:<P>

	 Office or outpatient clinic:  Visits are usually under one hour.  The number of visits per week depends on the youngster's needs.<P>

	   Intensive case management:  Specially trained individuals coordinate or provide psychiatric, financial, legal and medical services to help the child or adolescent live successfully at home and in the community.<P>

	  Home-based treatment program:  A team of specially trained staff go into a home and develop a treatment program to help the child and family.<P>

	  Day treatment program:  This intensive treatment program provides psychiatric treatment with special education.  The child usually attends five days per week.<P>

	  Partial hospitalization (day hospital):  This provides all the treatment services of a psychiatric hospital, but the patients go home each evening.   Emergency/crisis services:  24-hour-per-day services for emergencies (for example, hospital emergency room, mobile crisis team).  Respite care:  A patient stays briefly away from home with specially trained individuals.   Therapeutic group home or community residence:  This therapeutic program usually includes 6 to 10 children or adolescents per home, and may be linked with a day treatment program or specialized educational program.   Crisis residence:  This setting provides short-term (usually fewer than 15 days) crisis intervention and treatment.  Patients receive 24-hour-per-day supervision.   Residential treatment facility:  Seriously disturbed patients receive intensive and comprehensive psychiatric treatment in a campus-   like setting on a longer-term basis.   Hospital treatment:  Patients receive comprehensive psychiatric treatment in a hospital.  Treatment programs should be specifically designed for either children or adolescents.  Length of treatment may be acute (a few days to 30 days) or intermediate (30 to 120 days).   Parents should ask questions whenever a professional recommends psychiatric treatment for their child or adolescent.  For instance, which types of treatment are provided, and by whom?  Parents should also ask about the length of time, the cost, and the advantages and disadvantages of the recommended type of program.  Parents should always feel free to obtain a second opinion about the best type of program for their child or adolescent.<P>

<H1>THE DEPRESSED CHILD</H1>

	Not only adults become depressed.  Children and teenagers also may have depression. Depression is defined as an illness when it persists.<P>
	Significant depression probably exists in about 5 percent of children and adolescents in the general population.  Children under stress, who experience loss, or who have attentional, learning or conduct disorders are at a higher risk for depression.<P>
	The behavior of depressed children and teenagers differs from the behavior of depressed adults.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists advise parents to be aware of signs in their youngsters such as:
<UL>
<LI>Persistent sadness
<LI>An inability to enjoy previously favorite activities;
<LI>Increased activity or irritability;
<LI>Frequent complaints of physical illnesses such as headaches and stomachaches;
<LI>Frequent absences from school or poor performance in school;
<LI>Persistent boredom, low energy, poor concentration; or
<LI>A major change in eating and/or sleeping patterns.
</UL>
	A child who used to play often with friends may now spend most of the time alone and without interests.  Things that were once fun now bring little joy to the depressed child. Children and adolescents who are depressed may say they want to be dead or may talk about suicide.  Depressed adolescents may abuse alcohol or other drugs as a way to feel better.<P>
	Children and adolescents who cause trouble at home or at school may actually be depressed but not know it.  Because the youngster may not always seem sad, parents and teachers may not realize that troublesome behavior is a sign of depression.  When asked directly, these children can sometimes state they are unhappy or sad.<P>
	Early diagnosis and medical treatment are essential for depressed children.  For help, parents should ask their physician to refer them to a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who can diagnose and treat depression in children and teenagers.<P>

<H1>DISCIPLINE</H1>

	 Helping a child to behave in an acceptable manner is a necessary part of raising the child well.  Discipline varies at different ages.  There is no one right way to raise children, but child and adolescent psychiatrists offer the following general guidelines: Children generally want to please their parents.  Wise parents can in their disciplining activities use children's desire to please.<P>

	 When parents show joy and approval for behavior that please them, this reinforces good behavior in the child.  When parents show disapproval of dangerous or unpleasant behaviors at the early stages, they are more likely to be successful when the child is older. The way the parent corrects a child or adolescent for misbehavior should make sense to the youngster, and not be too strict that the child or adolescent cannot later feel the parent's love and good intentions.<P>

	 Children and adolescents can and do anger parents, and parents need good self-control when they are angry.  Although a loud "no" may get the attention of a toddler heading for a street full of traffic, it does not quiet a crying baby.  For older children, there should be clear expectations, agreed upon by both parents and clearly told to the child or adolescent. In our mixed society, where cultures and parenting styles are varied, different families expect different behaviors from their children.<P>

	 One child may be allowed to come home at any time, while another child may have a strict curfew.  When parents and children disagree about rules, an honest exchange of ideas may help them learn from each other.  However, parents must be responsible for setting the family's rules and values. Keeping unwanted behavior from happening in the first place is easier than stopping it later.<P>

	 It is better to put breakable or treasured objects out of the reach of  toddlers than to punish them for breaking them.  Parents should encourage curiosity but should direct it into activities like playing with puzzles, learning to use paints or reading a book. Changing a child's unwanted behaviors can help the child have the self-control needed to become responsible and considerate of others. Self-control does not happen automatically or suddenly.  Infants and toddlers need parental guidance and support to begin the process of learning self-control.  Self-control usually begins to show by age six.  With parents guiding the process, self-control increases throughout the school years.  Teenage experimentation and rebellion may occur, but most youngsters pass through this period and become responsible adults--especially if they had good early training. Families pass methods of discipline and what is expected of children from generation to generation.  When discipline attempts are not successful, it is often helpful for someone outside the family to make useful suggestions on raising a child.  Professionals trained in child growth and behavior can give information on the way children think and develop.  They can also suggest different approaches to changing unwanted behavior.  The patience of parents, and help from caring professionals, when necessary, will help smooth the way for children to learn and enjoy what society expects of them and what they can expect from themselves.<P>

<H1>HELPING CHILDREN AFTER A DISASTER</H1> 

	A catastrophe such as an earthquake, hurricane, tornado, fire or flood is frightening to children and adults alike.  It is important to acknowledge the frightening parts of the disaster when talking with a child about it.  Falsely minimizing the danger will not end a child's concerns.  Several factors affect a child's response to a disaster.  <P>

	The way children see and understand their parents' response is very important.  Children are aware of their parents' worries most of the time but they are particularly sensitive during a crisis.  Parents should admit their concerns to their children, and also stress their abilities to cope with the situation. <P>

	A child's reaction also depends on how much destruction he or she sees during and after the disaster.  If a friend or family member has been killed or seriously injured, or if the child's school or home has been severely damaged, there is a greater chance that the child will experience difficulties. <P>

	A child's age affects how the child will respond to the disaster.  For example, six- year-olds may show their concerns about a catastrophe by refusing to attend school, whereas adolescents may minimize their concerns but argue more with parents and show a decline in school performance.  It is important to explain the event in words the child can understand. <P>

	Following a disaster, people may develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which is psychological damage that can result from experiencing, witnessing or participating in an overwhelmingly traumatic (frightening) event.  Children with this disorder have repeated episodes in which they re-experience the traumatic event.  Children often relive the trauma through repetitive play.  In young children, distressing dreams of the traumatic event may change into nightmares of monsters, of rescuing others or of threats to self or others. <P>

	PTSD rarely appears during the trauma itself.  Though its symptoms can occur soon after the event, the disorder often surfaces several months or even years later.   Parents should be alert to these changes:  
<UL>
<LI>Refusal to return to school and "clinging" behavior, shadowing the mother or fatheraround the house; 
<LI>Persistent fears related to the catastrophe (such as fears about being permanentlyseparated from parents); 
<LI>Sleep disturbances such as nightmares, screaming during sleep and bedwetting,persisting more than several days after the event; 
<LI>Loss of concentration and irritability; 
<LI>Behavior problems--for example, misbehaving in school or at home in ways thatare not typical for the child; 
<LI>Physical complaints (stomachaches, headaches, dizziness) for which a physicalcause cannot be found; 
<LI>Withdrawal from family and friends, listlessness, decreased activity, preoccupationwith the events of the disaster. 
</UL>

	Professional advice or treatment for children affected by a disaster--especially those who have witnessed destruction, injury or death--can help prevent or minimize PTSD.  Parents who are concerned about their children can ask their pediatrician or family doctor to refer them to a child and adolescent psychiatrist.<P>

<H1>HOME ALONE CHILDREN</H1>

	  Every day thousands of children arrive home from school to an empty house.  Every week thousands of parents make decisions to leave children home alone while they go to work, run errands, or for social engagements.  It is estimated over 40% of children are left home at some time - though rarely overnight.  In more extreme situations, some children spend so much time without their parent(s) that these children are labelled "latch key children" - referring to the house or apartment key strung visibly around their neck.<P>

	 The popular movie "Home Alone", and its sequel, have portrayed a child's survival skills in a very humorous, but unrealistic manner.  The realities facing children who find themselves home alone are very different.  There are many issues and potential risks and dangers that parent(s) should consider before a child is placed in this situation.  Parent(s) should consider the following:
<UL>
<LI>Age readiness
<LI>Definition of parental "rules and expectations"
<LI>How to access parent(s) or other adults (e.g. phone numbers)
<LI>Potentially unsafe situations (e.g. medical emergencies, fire, alcohol, drugs, strangers, guns, etc.)
<LI>When and how to answer the phone or doorbell
<LI>Use of phone
<LI>Friends and visitors coming to the house
<LI>Responsibilities for siblings
<LI>Use of unstructured time (e.g. watch TV, videos, etc.)
<LI>Access to "adult" cable TV
</UL>

	 It is not possible to make a general statement about when (at what age) a  child can be left home alone.  Older adolescents are usually responsible enough to manage alone for limited periods of time.  Parent(s) must consider the child's level of maturity and past evidence of responsible behavior and good judgement.  Time periods when parent(s) are absent should be limited.  Parent(s) must talk with their youngsters to prepare them to develop a plan that addresses each of the issues or potential problems listed above.  In addition, parent(s) should strive to make their home as safe as possible from obvious dangers and hazards and rehearse the developed "emergency plan" with their children. Being home alone can be a frightening and potentially dangerous situation for many children and adolescents.  Parents should strive to limit the times when children are home alone.  Parents should prepare their children in advance for how to deal with situations that may arise.<P>

<H1>THE INFLUENCE OF MUSIC AND ROCK VIDEOS</H1> 

	Singing and music have always played an important role in learning and the communication of culture.  Children learn from the role models what they see and hear.  For the past 30 years, some children's television has very effectively used the combination of words, music and fast-paced animation to achieve learning. <P>

	Most parents are concerned about what their young children see and hear, but as children grow older, parents pay less attention to the music and videos that hold their children's interest. <P>

	The sharing of musical tastes between generations in a family can be a pleasurable experience.  Music also is often a major part of a teenager's separate world.  It is quite common for teenagers to get pleasure from keeping adults out and causing adults some distress.<P>

	A concern to many interested in the development and growth of teenagers is a serious deterioration in the messages of some rock music, including best-selling albums promoted by major record companies.  The following troublesome themes are prominent: 
<UL>
<LI>Advocating and glamorizing abuse of drugs and alcohol. 
<LI>Pictures and explicit lyrics presenting suicide as an "alternative" or "solution." 
<LI>Graphic violence. 
<LI>Preoccupation with the occult;  songs about satanism and human sacrifice, and the apparent enactment of these rituals in concerts.  
<LI>Sex which focuses on controlling sadism, masochism, incest, devaluing women, and violence toward women.
</UL>	
<P>

Parents can help their teenagers by paying attention to their teenager's purchasing, listening and viewing patterns, and by helping them identify music that may be destructive. <P>

	Music is not usually a danger for a teenager whose life is happy and healthy.  But if a teenager is persistently preoccupied with music that has seriously destructive themes, and there are changes in behavior such as isolation, depression, alcohol or other drug abuse, a psychiatric evaluation should be considered. <P>

<H1>EL NI&Ntilde;O ADOPTADO</H1>
<P>Los padres que han adoptado un ni&ntilde;o suelen preocuparse sobre cu&aacute;ndo y c&oacute;mo enterarlos sobre su adopci&oacute;n. Tambi&eacute;n quieren saber si hay problemas caracter&iacute;sticos de los ni&ntilde;os adoptados.
<P>Por lo general los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes recomiendan que le informe al ni&ntilde;o sobre su adopci&oacute;n. Esto ayuda a llevarle el mensaje de que adoptar es bueno y de que el ni&ntilde;o puede confiar en sus padres. Por otro lado, si por haber mantenido la adopci&oacute;n en secreto, el ni&ntilde;o llega a saber de su adopci&oacute;n cuando es mayor, puede sentir rabia y desconfianza hacia sus padres y ver la adopci&oacute;n como algo malo.
<P>Al ni&ntilde;o(a) se le debe ofrecer informaci&oacute;n de acuerdo con lo que &eacute;l o ella pueda entender. Cuando es peque&ntilde;o los padres pueden comentar, &quot;estoy muy contento porque te adopt&eacute;&quot;, y tambi&eacute;n pueden a&ntilde;adir, &quot;qu&eacute; beb&eacute; m&aacute;s hermoso eres t&uacute;&quot;. Aunque el beb&eacute; no entender&aacute; estas palabras, s&iacute; entender&aacute; su significado positivo. Esta comunicaci&oacute;n ayuda a establecer las bases para una discusi&oacute;n sobre su adopci&oacute;n, m&aacute;s adelante.
<P>A medida que el ni&ntilde;o crece, la adopci&oacute;n puede ser presentada como un acto de cari&ntilde;o y preocupaci&oacute;n por su bienestar de parte de sus padres biol&oacute;gicos. Una explicaci&oacute;n posible ser&iacute;a; &quot;cuando tu naciste los padres que te trajeron al mundo no pod&iacute;an atenderte adecuadamente pero quer&iacute;an lo mejor para t&iacute; Ellos hicieron los arreglos para que t&uacute; vivieras con un padre y una madre que estaban listos para quererte y cuidarte&quot;.
<P>Los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes encuentran que cuando los ni&ntilde;os(as) saben sobre su adopcion tienen una variedad de reacciones. Pueden negar la adopci&oacute;n, o idear fantas&iacute;as acerca de ella. Frecuentemente los ni&ntilde;os adoptados piensan que fueron regalados porque eran malos o pueden creer que han sido raptados. Si los padres hablan abiertamente acerca de la adopci&oacute;n y la presentan de forma positiva, la posibilidad de que surjan estas preocupaciones disminuye.
<P>Los adolescentes atraviesan por una etapa normal en su desarrollo en la que luchan por establecer su identidad y tratan de encontrar c&oacute;mo encajan dentro de su familia, sus pares y el resto del mundo. Durante esa etapa, el adolescente adoptado tiende a desarrollar un mayor inter&eacute;s por sus padres de origen; &eacute;sto es normal y no significa est&eacute;n rechazando a sus padres adoptivos. Algunos adolescentes desean conocer la identidad de sus padres biol&oacute;gicos. Los padres adoptivos deben respaldar ese inter&eacute;s pero la b&uacute;squeda debe posponerse hasta que el adolescente tenga mayor madurez. Al igual que cualquier otro ni&ntilde;o, el ni&ntilde;o adoptado puede desarrollar problemas emocionales y de conducta: los problemas pueden o no ser el resultado de inseguridades relacionadas con la adopci&oacute;n.
<P>Un psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes es un m&eacute;dico con S a&ntilde;os de adiestramiento en este campo. Puede ayudar al ni&ntilde;o y a sus padres adoptivos a entender las razones para los problemas que surjan y ayudar con las inseguridades que puedan haber sido el resultado de la adopci&oacute;n.

<H1>NI&Ntilde;OS QUE MOJAN LA CAMA</H1>
<P>La mayor parte de los ni&ntilde;os dejan de orinarse en la cama durante toda la noche para los tres a&ntilde;os de edad. Los padres empiezan a preocuparse cuando pasada esta edad, los ni&ntilde;os(as) contin&uacute;an orin&aacute;ndose en la cama. Esta condici&oacute;n es conocida por enuresis.
<P>Los m&eacute;dicos enfatizan que la enuresis no es una enfermedad sino un s&iacute;ntoma, y es batante com&uacute;n. Orinarse en la cama puede suceder de forma accidental, particularmente cuando el ni&ntilde;o(a) esta enfermo(a). Los padres deben conocer algunos datos acerca de la enuresis:

<UL>
<LI>Aproximadamente el 15% de los ni&ntilde;os(as) contin&uacute;an orin&aacute;ndose en la cama despu&eacute;s de los tres a&ntilde;os.
<LI>La enuresis es mucho mas frecuente en los varones que en las ni&ntilde;as.
<LI>La enuresis corre en familias.
<LI>Frecuentemente cesa al llegar a la pubertad.
</UL>
<P>El orinarse en la cama persistentemente despu&eacute;s de los 3-4 a&ntilde;os es rara vez causado por enfermedad del ri&ntilde;on o de la vejiga. La enuresis puede estar asociada a un trastorno del sue&ntilde;o. En otros casos, puede ser causada por cierto retraso en el desarrollo del sistema nervioso. Es con frecuencia el resultado de tensiones o de problemas emocionales en el ni&ntilde;o(a).
<P>Hay varias causas emocionales asociadas a la enuresis. Por ejemplo cuando un(a) ni&ntilde;o(a) se ha mantenido seco durante la noche por meses o a&ntilde;os y vuelve a mojar la cama, puede estar deseando inconscientemente volver a ser un beb&eacute;.
<P>Frecuentemente el episodio puede suceder despu&eacute;s de algun evento que le haya hecho sentir inseguro, como la mudanza a una nueva ciudad, la p&eacute;rdida de un miembro de la familia, y en especial, el arribo de un nuevo beb&eacute; en el hogar.
<P>A veces la enuresis ocurre luego de un per&iacute;odo &quot;seco&quot; debido a que el entrenamiento original fue muy traum&aacute;tico. Los padres deben recordar que los ni&ntilde;os raramente se orinan a prop&oacute;sito y que generalmente se sienten avergonzados con el episodio. En lugar de avergonzarlo o hacerlo sentir que es malo se le debe animar, y tener confianza de que pronto lograr&aacute; mantenerse seco durante toda la noche.
<P>En algunos casos este problema no puede ser resuelto por los padres, el m&eacute;dico de la familia o el pediatra. A veces el ni&ntilde;o muestra s&iacute;ntomas de conflicto emocional como tristeza, irritabilidad persistente o cambios en h&aacute;bitos de alimentaci&oacute;n o de sue&ntilde;o. En esos casos los padres pueden consultar un Psiquiatra de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes. Este m&eacute;dico con cinco a&ntilde;os de entrenamiento adicional en psiquiatr&iacute;a general y de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes, podr&aacute; evaluar los problemas f&iacute;sicos y emocionales que est&aacute;n causando la enuresis y trabajar con el ni&ntilde;o y familia en resolver esos problemas.

<H1>MALTRATO DE NI&Ntilde;OS - LAS MAGULLADURAS ESCONDIDAS</H1>

<P>Las estadisticas relacionadas con el maltrato de menores son alarmantes. En los Estados Unidos se estima que de los 259,000 a 500,000 ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes que son maltratados por sus padres o alg&uacute;n familiar cercano, mueren por lo menos 4,000 de ellos. De los que sobreviven, los efectos o huellas emocionales perduran por mucho tiempo despu&eacute;s que las marcas externas han sanado. La comunidades y las cortes de justicia reconocen que los efectos emocionales escondidos pueden ser tratados con &eacute;xito.
<P>Con frecuencia el da&ntilde;o emocional severo que ha sufrido un ni&ntilde;o maltratado no se hace evidente hasta la adolescencia o a&uacute;n m&aacute;s tarde. Muchos ni&ntilde;os que han sido maltratados al convertirse en padres tambi&eacute;n maltratan a sus propios hijos. Un adulto que fue maltratado cuando ni&ntilde;o ha de tener dificultad en establecer relaciones personales intimas, y tender&aacute; a ver a los dem&aacute;s adultos como maltratantes potenciales. Estos hombres y mujeres &quot;no pueden soportar que los toquen&quot;. Sin el manejo adecuado pueden perjudicarse por el resto de sus vidas.
<P>Aquellos ni&ntilde;os que han sido maltratados pueden presentar:

<UL>
<LI>Una imagen personal muy pobre.
<LI>Inhabilidad para depender, confiar, o querer a otros.
<LI>Agresividad, desorden de comportamiento y a veces conducta delincuente.
<LI>Actitud pasiva y/o aislada. Temor a iniciar relaciones o actividades nuevas.
<LI>Fracasos acad&eacute;micos.
<LI>Serio abuso de drogas o alcohol.
</UL>

<P>El psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os es un m&eacute;dico que tiene cinco a&ntilde;os de adiestramiento avanzado en psiquiatr&iacute;a general y de ni&ntilde;os. Este puede tratar los problemas f&iacute;sicos y psicol&oacute;gicos que han ocurrido como resultado del maltrato. A trav&eacute;s de su tratamiento el ni&ntilde;o maltratado comenzar&aacute; nuevamente a ganar un sentido de confianza en s&iacute; mismo y en otros. El psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os puede tambi&eacute;n ayudar a la familia a aprender nuevas formas de apoyo mutuo y estilos de comunicaci&oacute;n.
<P>El maltrato f&iacute;sico no es la &uacute;nica forma de maltrato. Muchos ni&ntilde;os son v&iacute;ctimas del abandono, o el abuso sexual o emocional. En todos los tipos de maltrato de menores, el ni&ntilde;o y la familia pueden beneficiarse de una evaluaci&oacute;n comprehensiva y la atenci&oacute;n de un psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os.

<hr>
<H1>ABUSO SEXUAL DE MENORES</H1>

<P>Recientemente se ha registrado un aumento significativo en los casos de

abuso sexual a menores. Sin embargo, la incidencia de casos que no son informados es mucho mayor, ya que muchos ni&ntilde;os sienten miedo de mencionar a alguien sobre el abuso ocurrido; adem&aacute;s el procedimiento legal para validar el episodio es dif&iacute;cil. Sin la identificaci&oacute;n del problema, control inme

diato del abuso, y la ayuda profesional, los efectos emocionales y sicol&oacute;gicos para el ni&ntilde;o pueden ser a la larga desvastadores.

<P>El abuso sexual a los ni&ntilde;os puede ocurrir dentro del seno familiar por parte de un padre,padrastrlo, hermano, o cualquier otro familiar. Puede ocurrir de afuera como por ejemplo, por un amigo, vecino, persona que cuide al ni&ntilde;o, maestro o por una persona extra&ntilde;a. Como quiera que esto ocurra el ni&ntilde;o desarrollar&aacute; una variedad de sentimientosy pensamientos nocivos que le

producir&aacute;n incomodidad.

<P>Ning&uacute;n ni&ntilde;o est&aacute; suficientemente equipado para enfrentarse y manejar estimulaci&oacute;n sexual repetida. Hasta un peque&ntilde;o de 2-3 a&ntilde;os, que no puede saber que actividad sexual es incorrecta puede desarrollar problemas que

son el resultado de su inhabilidad para hacer frente a la sobreestimaci&oacute;n.

<P> Un ni&ntilde;o que est&aacute; siendo victima de un abuso sexual prolongado usualmente desarrolla un amor propio bajot sentimientos de inutilidad y una percepci&oacute;n anormal sobre la sexualidad. El ni&ntilde;o puede aislarse y tornarse desconfiado de los adultos y convertirse en un riesgo suicida. Algunos ni&ntilde;os de los que se ha abusado sexualmente tienen dificultad relacion&aacute;ndose con otras personas por temor de hacerlo s&oacute;lo en t&eacute;rminos sexuales. Muchos de estos ni&ntilde;os se convierten en abusadores de otros ni&ntilde;os, en prostitutas, o desarrollan otros problemas serios cuando llegan a la edad adulta. Con frecuencia, el abuso sexual a los ni&ntilde;os no deja huella fisicas, o deja peque&ntilde;os da&ntilde;os, por lo general en el &aacute;rea anal o genital, que s&oacute;lo un m&eacute;dico puede detectar.

<P>Conductas frecuentemente observadas en ni&ntilde;os abusados sexualmente incluyen:

<UL>
<LI>Inter&eacute;s poco com&uacute;n, desinter&eacute;s o rechazo de todo aquello de naturaleza sexual.
<LI>Problemas con el dormir, pesadillas.
<LI>Aislamiento de amigos y familiares; depresi&oacute;n.
<LI>Conducta seductora.
<LI>Manifestaciones verbales de que su cuerpo es sucio o ha sido da&ntilde;ado, o miedo de que pueda tener algo malo en &aacute;rea genital.
<LI>Rehusar asistir a la escuela; delincuencia.
<LI>Secretividad.
<LI>Expresi&oacute;n de algunos aspectos de la actividad sexual ocurrida en dibujos, juegos o fantasias.
<LI>Agresividad poco com&uacute;n.
<LI>Conducta suicida.
<LI>Otros cambios radicales en su conducta.
</UL>

<P>Ya que el abusador sexual puede crear en el ni&ntilde;o un miedo intenso a relatar lo sucedido, los padres deben de hacer esfuerzos por asegurarle al ni&ntilde;o que puede sentirse en libertad de hablar. Si el ni&ntilde;o(a) dice que ha sido molestado(a), los padres deben enfatizar que lo que ocurri&oacute; no es culpa de &eacute;l. Este se beneficiaria de un &eacute;xamen m&eacute;dico y de una evaluaci&oacute;n psiqui&aacute;trica.

<P>Medidas preventivas que los padres pueden tomar:

<UL>
<LI>Decir al ni&ntilde;o, "si alguien trata de tocar tu cuerpo y de hacer cosas que te hacen sentir raro, di que no a esa persona y dimelo enseguida".
<LI>Ense&ntilde;ar a los ni&ntilde;os que respeto no quiere decir obediencia ciega a los adultos y a la autoridad; por ejemplo no diga a los ni&ntilde;os- "haz todo lo que te diga la ni&ntilde;era o la maestra"
<LI>Apoye programas de prevenci&oacute;n en la comunidad y el sistema escolar.
</UL>

<P>La mejor forma de evitar el riesgo de que un ni&ntilde;o abusado desarrolle problemas mas serios como adulto es proveyendo ayuda profesional tan pronto como sea posible.

<P>El psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os puede ayudar al ni&ntilde;o a recobrar su sentido de autoestimaci&oacute;n y aliviarle sus sentimientos de culpa acerca del abuso. Puede tambi&eacute;n ayudar a los miembros de la familia a entender c&oacute;mo puede colaborar con el ni&ntilde;o para que supere el trauma.

<H1>ENFERMEDADES CRONICAS EN NI&Ntilde;OS Y ADOLESCENTES</H1>
<P>Los ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes con enfermedades cr&oacute;nicas serias como el asma bronquial, epilepsia, anemia, enfermedades renales, cardiovascuiares, diabetes y otras, corren un riesgo mayor de desarrollar problemas sicol&oacute;gicos. A diferencia de aquellos ni&ntilde;os que desarrollan una enfermedad aguda y de corta duraci&oacute;n como la influenza, el ni&ntilde;o con una condici&oacute;n cr&oacute;nica tiene que enfrentarse a la realidad de que tiene una enfermedad que &quot;lleg&oacute; para quedarse&quot; o que la misma pueda empeorar. Los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes se&ntilde;alan que al comienzo de la condici&oacute;n los ni&ntilde;os rehusan creer que est&aacute;n enfermos y que m&aacute;s adelante desarrollan sentimientos de culpa y enojo.
<P>El ni&ntilde;o peque&ntilde;o, incapaz de entender porqu&eacute; se ha enfermado, puede suponer que ha sido castigado por haberse portado mal o ser malo y puede sentir rabia contra sus padres y su m&eacute;dico por no poder curarlo. El ni&ntilde;o suele oponerse a los cuidados, los mimos, bromas u otras atenciones que se le presten. Puede tambi&eacute;n reaccionar con malhumor, o aislamiento debido a las medidas inc&oacute;modas, restricciones alimenticias y de actividad que muchas veces conlleva el tratamiento de estas enfermedades.
<P>Los adolescentes con enfermedades cr&oacute;nicas o prolongadas pueden sentirse empujados en diferentes direcciones. Por un lado, debe atender su problema f&iacute;sico, el cual significa mantener la dependencia en sus padres y m&eacute;dicos. Por otro lado, elDa) adolescente desea independizarse, y reunirse con sus amistades.
<P>Cuando el adolescente con una enfermedad cr&oacute;nicat trata de disminuir o se niega a tomar el medicamente, est&aacute; demostando un deseo normal de controlar su propio cuerpo.
<P>Las enfermedades cr&oacute;nicas pueden interferir con el aprovechamiento acad&eacute;mico y el inter&eacute;s por la escuela. Lo cual puede aumentar su sentimiento de soledad y hacerle sentir diferente de los dem&aacute;s ni&ntilde;os de su edad.
<P>Como es natural, los padres desean hacer todo lo posible para ayudar a sus hijos para enfrentarse a su condici&oacute;n. Ellos deben responder no s&oacute;lo a la enfermedad del ni&ntilde;o sino tambi&eacute;n a sus fortalezas. Los Psiquiatras de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes saben que si los ni&ntilde;os son sobreprotegidos no aprender&aacute;n a relacionarse adecuadamente y pueden tener dificultades para separarse de sus padres al momento de asistir a la escuela. Es de gran ayuda el que estos ni&ntilde;os tengan la oportunidad de relacionarse con otros ni&ntilde;os que han aprendido a vivir satisfactoriamente con enfermedades cr&oacute;nicas.
<P>Durante per&iacute;odos de hospitalizaci&oacute;n prolongada o descanso en casa, algunos ni&ntilde;os(as) desarrollan intereses, destrezas o habilidades excelentes como por ejemplo, en ciertos juegos, armando juguetes, lectura, o aprendiendo un idioma extranjero. Tambi&eacute;n suelen aprender much&iacute;simo acerca de su enfermedad. Por ser psicol&oacute;gicamente provechosas y estas actividades deben ser fomentadas.
<P>Con frecuencia los ni&ntilde;os con enfermedades prolongadas o cr&oacute;nicas son tratados por un equipo de especialistas m&eacute;dicos incluyendo el psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes. Este &uacute;ltimo es un m&eacute;dico con cinco a&ntilde;os de adiestramiento especializado en el campo de la conducta humana que puede ayudar al ni&ntilde;o y a sus padres a desarrollar actitudes psicol&oacute;gicamente sanas para enfrentarse a una enfermedad de este tipo, sus efectos y su tratamiento.

<HR><H1>LOS NI&Ntilde;OS Y EL DIVORCIO</H1>

Con frecuencia se traen ni&ntilde;os al psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os cuando sus angustiados padres se est&aacute;n divorciando. Aun cuando los padres se encuentran preocupados por sus propios problemas matrimoniales ellos se dan cuenta de que son las personas m&aacute;s importantes en la vida de sus ni&ntilde;os.
<P>
Por un lado, mientras los padres se encuentran agobiados por las consecuencias del divorcio, por otro los ni&ntilde;os se sienten atemorizados y confusos pues &eacute;ste amenaza su sentido de seguridad. Ya que el divorcio tiende a confundir a los ni&ntilde;os, es necesario que les haga saber lo que est&aacute; sucediendo en el matrimonio, cu&aacute;l es su participaci&oacute;n o no participaci&oacute;n en el problema y qu&eacute; ser&aacute; lo que suceder&aacute; con ellos una vez se resuelva la situaci&oacute;n.
<P>
Con frecuencia algunos ni&ntilde;os creen que ellos son la causa del conflicto entre su padre y madre. Muchos de ellos asumen la responsabilidad de tratar de reconciliar y reunir a sus padres, a veces a costa de su propio sacrificio. El divorcio trae como resultado la p&eacute;rdida de uno de sus padres. Esto puede originar una vulnerabilidad seria tanto para enfermedades fisicas como mentales en ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes.
<P>
Con cuidado y atenci&oacute;n apropiada durante el divorcio se pueden movilizar los recursos y el potencial de familia. De este modo los padres pueden ayudar a los ni&ntilde;os a sacar provecho de la soluci&oacute;n del conflicto entre ellos.
<P>
Es muy importante que los padres est&eacute;n alerta a algunas senales de ansiedad en su ni&ntilde;o, como lo son la p&eacute;rdida de motivaci&oacute;n en la escuela, dificultad para hacer amigos, y poco deseo de disfrutar de los bienes de la vida.
<P>
Otras se&ntilde;ales que deben alertar a los padres incluyen disturbios en el sue&ntilde;o, como dormir muy poco o demasiado, as&iacute; como tornarse m&aacute;s rebeldes o crear conflictos hacia otros miembros de la familia.
<P>
Durante el per&iacute;odo de duraci&oacute;n del divorcio no se olvide del estr&eacute;s por el que est&aacute; pasando su ni&ntilde;o. Su responsabilidad con el bienestar del nino es vital. Pida a su m&eacute;dico que le refiera a un psiquiatra especialista en ni&ntilde;os, quien diagnosticar&aacute; y le ayudar&aacute; a resolver el problema.

<H1>LOS NI&Ntilde;OS Y LAS MUDANZAS</H1>
<P>Mudarse a una comunidad nueva es una de las experiencias que m&aacute;s impacto puede tener en una familia. Los traslados, sean &eacute;stos ocasionales o frecuentes, pueden ser dif&iacute;ciles de manejar, particularmente para los ni&ntilde;os, a&uacute;n cuando tengan otros hermanitos en la familia. Los traslados interrumpen las amistades. Al llegar a una nueva escuela, el ni&ntilde;o nota que los otros estudiantes tienen ya sus amigos y se interesan en sus propias actividades. El ni&ntilde;o tiene que adaptarse a un curr&iacute;culo nuevo y puede encontrarse adelantado en ciertas materias y/o rezagado en o&#191;ras, caus&aacute;ndole aburrimiento o angustia.
<P>Los ni&ntilde;os que est&aacute;n en kindergarten o en primer grado tienden a ser m&aacute;s vulnerables a las mudanzas. En esta edad ellos est&aacute;n en el proceso de separarse de sus padres y de adaptarse a nuevas figuras de autoridad y a nuevos compa&ntilde;eros de su edad. El traslado puede interferir con el proceso normal de separaci&oacute;n y causar que los ni&ntilde;os vuelvan a un estado mayor de dependencia de sus padres. Por lo general mientras mayor es el ni&ntilde;o(a) mayor ser&aacute; la dificultad que tendr&aacute; con el traslado debido a la aumentada importancia que el grupo de pares va adquiriendo para el ni&ntilde;o a medida que madura. Puede que los pre-adolescentes y adolescentes protesten y pidan a sus padres que les permitan quedarse en casa de un amigo o familiar.
<P>Sin embargo, hay j&oacute;venes que no expresan su molestia directamente, por lo que sus padres deben de estar alertas a se&ntilde;ales de depresi&oacute;n como por ejemplo, cambios en el apetito, aislamiento, baj&oacute;n en el aprovechamiento acad&eacute;mico, irritabilidad, trastornos del sue&ntilde;o u otros cambios marcados de la conducta.
<P>Muchos ni&ntilde;os que aparentan estar deprimidos por el traslado pueden estar m&aacute;s preocupados por la tensi&oacute;n que sufren los padres para adaptarse al nuevo ambiente que por la relocalizaci&oacute;n misma. En algunas ocasiones el ni&ntilde;o reacciona negativamente al percibir que uno de los padres se opone a la mudanza.
<P>Si el ni&ntilde;o presenta se&ntilde;ales persistentes de depresi&oacute;n los padres deben pedir al m&eacute;dico de familia, al pediatra, o a la Sociedad M&eacute;dica local que lo refiera a un Psiquiatra de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes. Este es un m&eacute;dico con 5 a&ntilde;os de adiestramiento avanzado en Psiquiatr&iacute;a general y de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes. Est&aacute; capacitado para diagnosticar y tratar problemas f&iacute;sicos y emocionales que afectan al ni&ntilde;o y que son el resultado de la tensi&oacute;n producida por la mudanza. Adem&aacute;s, puede ayudar a los padres a hacer de la nueva experiencia una mucho m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil para toda la familia.
<P>Para que los ni&ntilde;os puedan manejar un traslado con mayor facilidad los Psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes ofrecen a los padres las siguientes recomendaciones:

<UL>
<LI>Explique claramente al ni&ntilde;o porqu&eacute; la mudanza es necesaria.
<LI>Familiarice al ni&ntilde;o lo m&aacute;s posible con el nuevo vecindario utilizando mapas, fotograf&iacute;as o peri&oacute;dicos.
<LI>Describa las ventajas que tiene la nueva ubicaci&oacute;n, como la presencia de un lago, de monta&ntilde;as o un parque de diversiones.
<LI> Luego del traslado debe tratar de que el ni&ntilde;o participe en actividades religiosas, Asociaci&oacute;n de Padres y Maestros, los ni&ntilde;os Exploradores, la YMCA, etc.
<LI>Si el/la hijo(a) se encuentra en su &uacute;ltimo a&ntilde;o escuela secundaria debe considerar la posibilidad de permiterle quedarse con una familia de su confianza hasta que termine el a&ntilde;o acad&eacute;mico.
</UL>
<P>Mientras m&aacute;s frecuentes son las mudanzas m&aacute;s importante es la estabilidad interna de la familia. Con la atenci&oacute;n apropiada de los padres, y con ayuda profesional, si &eacute;sta fuese necesaria, el traslado puede ser una experiencia positiva en el desarrollo de los ni&ntilde;os logrando m&aacute;s confianza en si mismos y mayor oportunidad para cultivar sus relaciones interpersonales.

<H1>LOS NI&Ntilde;OS Y EL LUTO</H1>
<P>Cuando muere un miembro de la familia, los ni&ntilde;os reaccionan de manera
diferente a los adultos. Por lo general los ni&ntilde;os de edad pre-escolar ven la muerte como temporal y reversible; una creencia que es reforzada por los personajes de los mu&ntilde;equitos de la televis&oacute;n que &quot;mueren&quot;, y &quot;regresan a la vida&quot; otra vez. Los ni&ntilde;os entre 5 y 9 a&ntilde;os piensan de forma parecida
a los adultos, aunque creen que nunca les pasar&aacute; a ellos o a alguien que
ellos conozcan.
<P>Adem&aacute;s del estado de shock y confusi&oacute;n producido por la p&eacute;rdida de un ser querido, el ni&ntilde;o puede sentir la falta de apoyo de otros miembros de la familia. Estos pueden estar tambi&eacute;n tan estremecidos por la p&eacute;rdida, que no le es posible llevar a cabo adecuadamente la responsabilidad normaldel cuidado del ni&ntilde;o.
<P>Los padres deben estar conscientes de las respuestas normales a una
muerte en la familia as&iacute; como de aquellas se&ntilde;ales indicativas de peligro. Durante las semanas que siguen a la muerte, es normal que los ni&ntilde;os sientan poca pena o que persistan en creer que la persona a&uacute;n vive. Pero la negaci&oacute;n prolongada de la muerte, as&iacute; como el evitar el dolor o pena es poco saludable y puede manifestarse luego en problemas m&aacute;s severos.  Un ni&ntilde;o que siente temor de asistir a un entierro no debe ser obligado a ir. Sin embargo es recomendable celebrar alg&uacute;n tipo servicio u observaci&oacute;n a la memoria del difunto, como ser&iacute;a el prender una vela, decir una oraci&oacute;n o visitar la tumba.
<P>Una vez el ni&ntilde;o acepta la muerte, estar&aacute; mas propenso a expresar de vez en cuando sentimientos de tristeza por largo tiempo y en ocasiones inesperadas. Los familiares sobrevivientes deben pasar el mayor tiempo posible junto al ni&ntilde;o, haci&eacute;ndole claro que expresar sus sentimientos abierta y libremente es correcto y deseable.
<P>El ni&ntilde;o ha perdido a alguien que es esencial para la estabilidad propia y de su mundo. Es por &eacute;sto que la ira es una reacci&oacute;n natural. Este enfado puede ser expresado a trav&eacute;s de un juego desordenado, pesadillas, irritabilidad o una variedad de comportamientos como por ejemplo, evacuarse encima. Con frecuencia el ni&ntilde;o puede demostrar furia hacia otros miembros sobrevivientes de la familia.
<P>Muchos ni&ntilde;os tienden a actuar como si fueran menores de lo que son despu&eacute;s de la muerte de uno de sus padres. Pueden tornarse infantiles, exigentes, llamar la atenci&oacute;n, buscar acurrucarse o hablar como si fueran bebes. Los ni&ntilde;os m&aacute;s peque&ntilde;os creen que ellos son la causa de las cosas que ocurren a su alrededor. Un ni&ntilde;o peque&ntilde;o puede creer que el padre o la madre, abuelo, hermano o hermana perdidos, muri&oacute; porque &eacute;l o ella habian estado deseando &quot;su muerte&quot; en alguna ocasi&oacute;n. El ni&ntilde;o se siente culpable porque &quot;su deseo&quot; se logr&oacute;.
<P>Algunas se&ntilde;ales de peligro que pueden aparecer en su ni&ntilde;o(a) cuando se le ha muerto un familiar incluyen:
<UL>
<LI>Un periodo prolongado de depresi&oacute;n durante el cual el ni&ntilde;o pierde inter&eacute;s en actividades y eventos usuales.
<LI>Inhabilidad para dormir, p&eacute;rdida de apetito, temor prolongado a quedarse solo.
<LI>Se comnorta o act&uacute;a como si fuera m&aacute;s peque&ntilde;o por un periodo de tiempo prolongado.
<LI>Imitaci&oacute;n excesiva de la persona desaparecida; expresiones repetidas de deseo de unirse con la persona muerta.
<LI>Alejarse de sus amigos.
<LI>Deterioro en funcionamiento acad&eacute;mico o rehusarse asistir a la escuela.
</UL>
<P>Estas se&ntilde;ales de aviso indican que el ni&ntilde;o est&aacute; teniendo problemas serios, que son el resultado de la muerte y que necesita ayuda profesional. Un psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os puede ayudar al ni&ntilde;o a aceptar la muerte y a apoyar a los sobrevivientes en la ayuda que prestan al ni&ntilde;o durante el proceso de luto.

<hr>
<H1>LOS NI&Ntilde;OS Y LA VIOLENCIA EN LA TELEVISION</H1>
<P>Muchos ni&ntilde;os pasan un promedio de 3-4 horas diarias viendo televisi&oacute;n. La televisi&oacute;n puede ser una influencia muy poderosa en el desarrollo del sistema de valores, en la formaci&oacute;n del car&aacute;cter y en la conducta. Lamentablemente muchos de los programas de televisi&oacute;n contienen un alto grado de violencia. Los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes que han estudiado los efectos de la violencia en la televisi&oacute;n han encontrado que &eacute;stos pueden:

<UL>
<LI>Imitar la violencia que observan en la televisi&oacute;n.
<LI>Identificarse con ciertos tipos, car&aacute;cteres, victimas y/o victimarios.
<LI>Tornarse &quot;inmunes&quot; al horror de la violencia; y
<LI>Gradualmente aceptar la violencia como manera de resolver problemas.
</UL>
<P>De manera que la exposici&oacute;n extensa a programas de televisi&oacute;n que contengan violencia causa mayor agresividad en los ni&ntilde;os. En ocasiones, el ver tan solo un programa violento puede aumentar la agresividad. Los ni&ntilde;os que ven espect&aacute;culos en los que la violencia es presentada de forma muy realista, repetida, o o sin ser castigada, tienen mayor probabilidad de imitar lo que ven. El impacto de la violencia en la televisi&oacute;n puede reflejarse en la conducta del ni&ntilde;o inmediatamente o manifestarse m&aacute;s tarde en su desarrollo. Las j&oacute;venes pueden afectarse a&uacute;n cuando en la atm&oacute;sfera familiar no haya tendencia hacia la violencia. Esto no quiere decir que la violencia que se ve en la televisi&oacute;n es la &uacute;nica causa de conducta violenta o agresiva, pero no hay dudas de que es un factor significativo.
<P>Los padres pueden proteger a los ni&ntilde;os del exceso de violencia en la televisi&oacute;n:

<UL>
<LI>Prestando mayor atenci&oacute;n a los programas que ven los ni&ntilde;os.
<LI>Estableciendo l&iacute;mites en el tiempo que pasan viendo televisi&oacute;n.
<LI> Evitando que vean aguellos programas conocidos como violentos. Deben cambiar el canal, o apagar el televisor cuando aparecen escenas ofensivas, y explicarle al ni&ntilde;o aquello que consideran malo del programa.
<LI>Se&ntilde;alar al ni&ntilde;o que aungue el actor no se lastim&oacute;, hiri&oacute;, o muri&oacute; durante el programa, la violencia puede producir dolor o muerte si sucede en la vida real.
<LI>Desaprobando los episodios violentos que suceden frente a los ni&ntilde;os, enfatizando el hecho de que esa no es la mejor forma de resolver un problema.
<LI>Para contrarestar la presi&oacute;n que ejercen los pares, compa&ntilde;eros y amigos, debe comunicarse con otros padres para poner en vigor reglas similares sobre el tiempo y tipo de programa que deben ver los ni&ntilde;os.
</UL>
<P>Los padres deben de utilizar estas medidas para prevenir los efectos da&ntilde;inos que la televisi&oacute;n puede tener en otras &aacute;reas como el estereotipo racial o sexual. Aparte del contenido del programa de televisi&oacute;n el tiempo que los ni&ntilde;os dedican a esta actividad debe lLmitarse ya que los saca de actividades m&aacute;s provechosas como lo son el jugar con sus amigos, la interacci&oacute;n familiar, el estudio y la lectura. Si los padres tienen dificultades serias estableciendo controles y l&iacute;mites o preocupaci&oacute;n genuina en cuanto a la reacci&oacute;n del ni&ntilde;o a la televisi&oacute;n, debe de consultar a un Psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes para que leayude con el problema.

<hr>
<H1>NI&Ntilde;OS DE PADRES ALCOHOLICOS</H1>
<P>Alrededor de 7 millones de ni&ntilde;os americanos tienen padres alcoh&oacute;licos. Los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes saben que estos ni&ntilde;os tienen un riesgo mayor para desarrollar problemas emocionales que los hijos(as) de padres que no son alcoh&oacute;licos. El alcoholismo corre en familias, y los ni&ntilde;os de padres alcoh&oacute;licos tienen cuatro veces mayor probabilidad de ser alcoholicos que otros ni&ntilde;os.
<P>Un ni&ntilde;o de este tipo de familia puede tener varios problemas:

<UL>
<LI>Sentimientos de culpa: El ni&ntilde;o(a) puede sentirse que es el causante del uso de alcohol por parte de su padre o madre.
<LI>Angustia o ansiedad: Puede sentirse continuamente preocupado por la situaci&oacute;n del hogar. Puede temer que el padre (madre) alcoh&oacute;lico(a) se enferme, se lesione o surjan peleas o violencia entre sus padres.
<LI>Verguenza: Los padres pueden dar el mensaje de que hay un secreto terrible en el hogar. Un ni&ntilde;o(a) avergonzado(a) no invita a sus amigos a la casa y teme pedir ayuda a alguien.
<LI>Incapacidad para mantener relaciones interpersonales: Debido a su decepci&oacute;n por el alcoholismo de su padre (madre) muchas veces desconf&iacute;a de los dem&aacute;s.
<LI>Confusi&oacute;n: Muchas veces la conducta del padres (madre) Alcoh&oacute;lica cambia repentinamente de cari&ntilde;oso a irritable, independientemente de la conducta del ni&ntilde;o(a). La rutina familiar diaria, tan importante para organizar su vida, queda alterada al cambiar constantemente los horarios de sue&ntilde;o, comida y otras actividades.
<LI>Enojo: El ni&ntilde;o puede sentir enojo contra el padre (madre) bebedor y molestia con el progenitor no alcoholico por no prestarle apoyo y proteccion
<LI>Depresi&oacute;n: El ni&ntilde;o se siente solo y desesperado en su empe&ntilde;o por cambiar la situaci&oacute;n.
</UL>

<P>Aunque el ni&ntilde;o trata de mantener en secreto el alcoholismo de sus padres, los maestros, familiares y otros adultos se dan cuenta de que algo anda mal. Los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes sugieren que la siguiente conducta en los ni&ntilde;os puede ser indicativa de problemas de alcohol en el hogar:
Pobre aprovechamiento acad&eacute;mico, fuga del hogar o de la escuela. - Pocos o ningunos amigos, se aisla de sus compa&ntilde;eros de clases. - Conducta delincuente como robo, vandalismo, violencia. - Quejas f&iacute;sicas frecuentes, como dolor de est&oacute;mago o cabeza. Abuso de droga o alcohol. - Agresi&oacute;n dirigida hacia otros ni&ntilde;os.
<P>Algunos ni&ntilde;os de padres alcoh&oacute;licos tienden a asumir el rol de &quot;padres responsables&quot; en la familia y entre los amigos. Tienden a manejar el alcoholismo de sus padres actuando de forma controlada, dedic&aacute;ndose a sus estudios con intensidad, alcanzando un aprovechamiento superior durante sus a&ntilde;os escolares, mientras se aislan emocionalmente de sus padres y compa&ntilde;eros. Sus problemas emocionales saldr&aacute;n a la luz cuando lleguen a la adultez.
<P>Estos ni&ntilde;os(as) se pueden beneficiar de ayuda de grupos como Al-Anon y Alateen. Ellos pueden asistir a sus sesiones a&uacute;n cuando sus padres no est&eacute;n recibiendo ayuda. La ayuda profesional temprana es muy importante para prevenir problemas mas serios incluyendo alcoholismo en los ni&ntilde;os. El psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes puede ayudarles a resolver sus problemas y a entender que no son responsables por el abuso de alcohol de sus padres.
<P>El programa de tratamiento puede incluir terapia de grupo con otros j&oacute;venes. Esto reduce el aislamiento gue se imponen por ser hijos de alcoh&oacute;licos. El psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes trabajar&aacute; con frecuencia con el grupo familiar sobre todo cuando el progenitor alcoh&oacute;lico deje de beber. As&iacute; se pueden fomentar relaciones m&aacute;s sanas entre los miembros de la familia.

<hr>
<H1>NI&Ntilde;OS QUE NO PUEDEN PRESTAR ATENCION</H1>
<P>Es inc&oacute;modo para los padres recibir una nota de la escuela en la que se les informa que su ni&ntilde;o &quot;no puede prestar atenci&oacute;n a la maestra&quot; o que &quot;causa problemas en la clase&quot;. Entre las varias razones para explicar este tipo de comportamiento hay una en particular que, por ser relativamente com&uacute;n, debe ser conocida por los padres. Se trata del Trastorno o Desorden de D&eacute;ficit de Atenci&oacute;n (DDA).
<P>Aunque un ni&ntilde;o con DDA desea ser un buen estudiante tiende a ser impulsivo e incapaz de prestar atenci&oacute;n debida en la clase. Los maestros, padres y compa&ntilde;eros saben que el ni&ntilde;o se est&aacute; portando mal, o que es &quot;diferente&quot;, pero no saben exactamente qu&eacute; es lo que anda mal. Un psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os puede diagnosticar y tratar al ni&ntilde;o con el desorden de D&eacute;ficit de Atenci&oacute;n. Esta es una condici&oacute;n que afecta aproximadamente el tres porciento de todos los ni&ntilde;os en los Estados Unidos. Es diez veces m&aacute;s com&uacute;n en ni&ntilde;os que ni&ntilde;as.
<P>Con frecuencia el DDA est&aacute; acompa&ntilde;ado por hiperactividad: los ni&ntilde;os m&aacute;s peque&ntilde;os tienden a correr y a trepar sobre objetos excesivamente; los ni&ntilde;os mayores se notan inquietos y nerviosos. En contraste con el alto nivel de actividad que normalmente ocurre en los ni&ntilde;os, en esta condici&oacute;n la hiperactividad es descuidada, pobremente organizada y carece de metas u objetividad  definidas. Un ni&ntilde;o que padece de DDA, con o sin hiperactividad, presenta varias de las siguientes caracter&iacute;sticas.:
<UL>
<LI>Dificultad al organizar su trabajo dando la impresi&oacute;n de que no ha escuchado las instrucciones.
<LI>Se distrae con facilidad.
<LI>Sus trabajos son descuidados, sucios y por su impulsividad comete errores.
<LI>Interrumpe la clase con frecuencia con comentarios o actuaciones inapropiadas.
<LI>Tiene dificultad en esperar su turno cuando est&aacute; en actividades de grupo.
<LI>No sigue las &oacute;rdenes o instrucciones que se le dan o los pedidos que se le hacen.
<LI>Se le hace dificil mantenerse jugando por el mismo tiempo que lo hacen sus compa&ntilde;eros de clase de su misma edad.
</UL>
<P>Sin el tratamiento apropiado, su ni&ntilde;a o ni&ntilde;o caer&aacute; progresivamente en atrasos permanentes en su trabajo escolar. Las relaciones con sus compa&ntilde;eros y amigos sufrir&aacute;n debido a su falta de cooperaci&oacute;n en los juegos y otras actividades sociales. Su amor propio se ver&aacute; a&uacute;n m&aacute;s afectado por el rechazo de sus amigos y las reprimendas repetidas de maestros y familsares al &eacute;stos no entender c&oacute;mo manejar su problema.
<P>Si un ni&ntilde;o presenta problemas de comportamiento como los descritos en DDA, los padres deben pedir a su pediatra o m&eacute;dico de familia que les refiera a un psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os. El psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os est&aacute; entrenado para tratar el Desorden de D&eacute;ficit de Atenci&oacute;n en su ni&ntilde;o. En ocasiones el uso de medicinas es &uacute;til y aconsejable, particularmente si el DDA est&aacute; acompa&ntilde;ado de hiperactividad. Al reunirse con el psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os los padres pueden aprender a manejar los problemas de su ni&ntilde;o. Adem&aacute;s, el psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os puede ayudar a los maestros y las autoridades escolares a encontrarformas de ense&ntilde;anza efectivas para estos ni&ntilde;os con Desorden de D&eacute;ficit de Atenci&oacute;n.

<hr>
<H1>NI&Ntilde;OS QUE ROBAN</H1>
<P>Un ni&ntilde;o o adolescente que roba es motivo de preocupaci&oacute;n para sus padres. A &eacute;stos les preocupa el motivo o causa para este acto y de que su hijo(a) pueda ser un(a) &quot;delincuente juvenil&quot;.
<P>Se considera normal el que ni&ntilde;os peque&ntilde;os tomen objetos que no le pertenecen cuando &eacute;stos atraen su inter&eacute;s y atenci&oacute;n. Esta conducta no se considera robo hasta que es algo mayor, usualmente entre 3-5 a&ntilde;os, cuando tiene edad suficiente para entender que algo no le pertenece y que es de otra persona.
<P>Los ni&ntilde;os mayores y los adolescentes que ya saben que el hurtar es incorrecto-lo hacen por varias razones. Pueden hacerlo para igualarse a sus hermanitos, como es el caso del ni&ntilde;o que siente que sus hermanitos son favorecidos con afecto y regalos
En otras ocasiones, el acto puede ser un esfuerzo para demostrar su valent&iacute;a ante los amigos, o para hacer regalos comprando as&iacute; su popularidad en la escuela o con sus compa&ntilde;eros.
<P>Los padres deben tratar de determinar si el robo es causado por la necesidad de llamar la atenci&oacute;n. De ser as&iacute;, el ni&ntilde;o puede estar tratando de expresar su enojo o vengarse de sus padres; el objeto robado puede convertirse en una especie de &quot;sustituto&quot; de la atenci&oacute;n o afecto que siente que no ha recibido. Los padres deben tratar de dar mayor reconocimiento al ni&ntilde;o(a) y hacerle sentir tan importante como cualquier otro miembro de la familia.
<P>Si los padres toman las medidas apropiadas, en la mayor&iacute;a de los casos, esta conducta desaparece a medida que el ni&ntilde;o crece. Los Psiquiatras de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes recomiendan a los padres que cuando se den cuenta de que su ni&ntilde;o ha robado deben:
<UL>
<LI>Decirle al ni&ntilde;o que robar es incorrecto, y porqu&eacute; lo es.
<LI>Ayudar al ni&ntilde;o a hacer planes para pagar o devolver el objeto robado.
<LI>Asegurarse de que el ni&ntilde;o no se beneficie del robo bajo ninguna circunstancia.
<LI>Evitar sermonear, pronosticar conducta delictiva futura o decirle que le considera un ladr&oacute;n o pillo.
<LI>Hacerle ver al ni&ntilde;o que su conducta est&aacute; totalmente fuera de lo esperado y no es aceptable dentro de la tradici&oacute;n familiar.
</UL>
<P>Una vez que el ni&ntilde;o ha pagado o restituido el objeto robado, el asunto debe dejarse a un lado y no volver a sacar el tema a discusi&oacute;n o echarlo en cara. Se le debe dar la oportunidad de volver a comenzar con un record limpio.
<P>Si a pesar de estas medidas el robo es persistente y el hurto contin&uacute;a, la conducta es indicativa de problemas m&aacute;s serios en el desarrollo emocional del ni&ntilde;o. Los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes saben que los ni&ntilde;os que roban persistentemente desconf&iacute;an de otras personas y no son capaces de establecer lazos emocionales o relaciones interpersonales &iacute;ntimas. En vez de sentirse culpable, ellos le achacan la culpa a otros defendi&eacute;ndose as&iacute;: &quot;si ellos rehusan darme lo que necesito, entonces lo tomo por mi cuenta&quot;. Algunos ni&ntilde;os roban debido al miedo que tienen a su dependencia; ellos no quieren depender de nadie, de manera que toman lo que necesitan.
<P>Para el manejo de un ni&ntilde;o que roba, el psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes evaluar&aacute; y diagnosticar&aacute; las razones para el robo y luego dise&ntilde;ar&aacute; un plan de tratamiento. Un aspecto importante en el tratamiento de estos ni&ntilde;os es ayudarlos a que aprendan a establecer buenas relaciones con otras personas. El psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes trabajar&aacute; tambi&eacute;n con la familia para que &eacute;sta mantenga su apoyo mientras el ni&ntilde;o cambia a una direcci&oacute;n m&aacute;s saludable en su desarrollo.

<H1>NI&Ntilde;OS QUE REHUSAN ASISTIR A LA ESCUELA</H1>
<P>Asistir a la escuela puede ser para muchos ni&ntilde;os una experiencia excitante, agradable, pero para otros puede traer temores, miedos, p&aacute;nico. Los padres tienen raz&oacute;n de preocuparse cuando su ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a se siente enfermo con frecuencia porque sufre de tensi&oacute;n emocional o cuando por peque&ntilde;os malestares f&iacute;sicos desea quedarse en el hogar y no asistir a la escuela. Un ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a entre las edades de 5 a 10 a&ntilde;os que se comporte de esa manera, est&aacute; padeciendo de un temor incapacitante a deffar a sus padres en el hogar. A los padres se les hace muy dificil enfrentarse y manejar apropiadamente esta situaci&oacute;n. Sin embargo, estos temores pueden ser tratados con &eacute;xito a trav&eacute;s de ayuda profesional .
<P>El primer episodio de temor o mi edo irracional hacia la escuela, ocurre t&iacute;picamente cuando un ni&ntilde;o va a asistir a una guarderia (&quot;nursery school&quot;), a un jardin de ni&ntilde;os (kindergarten) o durante el primer grado. Hay un aumento mayor en el segundo grado. El ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a puede quejarse de sintomas fisicos como dolores de cabeza, dolor de garganta, dolor de est&oacute;mago u otros, al acercarse la hora de partir para la escuela. El deja de &quot;sentirse mal&quot; cuando se le permite quedarse en la casa. La sintomatologia reaparece a la ma&ntilde;ana sigui&eacute;nte antes de irse para la escuela. En algunos casos el ni&ntilde;o  (ni&ntilde;a) simplemente rehusa salir de la casa.
<P>El rechazo a asistir ala escuela comienza despu&eacute;s que el ni&ntilde;o ha pasado un tiempo en el hogar durante el cual ha logrado apegarse m&aacute;s a la madre, como por ejemplo, durante las vaciones de verano o una enfermedad breve. Puede ocurrir tambi&eacute;n despu&eacute;s de una situaci&oacute;n de tensi&oacute;n (estr&eacute;s) como la p&eacute;rdida de un ser querido, una mascota, el cambio de escuela o una mudanza a un vecindario o comunidad nueva.
<P>Ni&ntilde;os que padecen de un miedo exagerado e irracional hacia la escuela pueden temer tambi&eacute;n quedarse solos en su habitaci&oacute;n, demostrar &quot;apego f&iacute;sico&quot; a sus padres o seguirle continuamente los pasos en la casa.
<P>Con frecuencia los ni&ntilde;os tienen dificultad en irse a la cama, a dormir y/o quedarse dormidos. Pueden demostrar un miedo exagerado e irreal a animales, monstruos, ladrones, robachicos, o a quedarse solos en la oscuridad.
<P>En un ni&ntilde;o que tiene temores persistentes,los efectos potenciales a largo plazo pueden ser muy serios si no recibe la ayuda profesional adecuada. Si este ni&ntilde;o se ausenta de la escuela y de sus amigos por per&iacute;odos de tiempo prolongados puede desarrollar problemas acad&eacute;micos o sociales serios.
<P>Tanto los padres como el ni&ntilde;o se puede beneficiar de la asistencia de un psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os que es un m&eacute;dico con 5 a&ntilde;os de adiestramiento especializado
<P>en psiquiatr&iacute;a general y de ni&ntilde;os. El psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os trabajar&aacute; con los padres y el ni&ntilde;o en un esfuerzo dirigido hacia reintegrar al ni&ntilde;o a la escuela y a otras actividades del diario vivir a la mayor brevedad. Ya que el p&aacute;nico que ocurre en el ni&ntilde;o es resultado de dejar el hogar y no de estar en la escuela, una vez en la escuela, &eacute;l se calma y se siente bien en la mayor&iacute;a de los casos.

<H1>NISOS CON TRASTORNOS PSIQUIATRICOS SERIOS</H1>
<P>Un ni&ntilde;o(a) que padece de un &quot;trastorno psiqui&aacute;trico severo&quot; tiene un padecimiento muy serio que le afecta el funcionamiento en varias &aacute;reas de su vida. Estas pueden incluir las emociones, la capacidad social o intelectual, o el uso adecuado del lenguaje. Los ni&ntilde;os con trastornos psiquiatricos severos pueden adem&aacute;s tener problemas f&iacute;sicos o retrazo mental.
<P>Al evaluar el Psiquiatra de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes a un ni&ntilde;o con un posible desorden psiqui&aacute;trico severo &oacute;uscar&aacute; ciertos s&iacute;ntomas y har&aacute;n a los padres preguntas como las siguientes:
<UL>
<LI>Evita mirar o sonretr ante sus padres u otros que le cuidan.
<LI>Actividades o apariencia muy extra&ntilde;as o raras.
<LI>Falta de movimiento o expresi&oacute;n facial.
<LI>Falta de inter&eacute;s en las personas o no reconoce o se d&aacute; cuenta de su presencia.
<LI>Habla en forma rara o utilizando un &quot;lenguaje privado&quot; que nadie m&aacute;s puede entender.
<LI>Conversaciones extra&ntilde;as consigo mismo.
<LI>Movimientos raros o repetitivos como por ejemplo girar o hacer girar objetos, dar palmadas o hacer movimientos peculiares y repetidos con las manos; golpearse la cabeza y
<LI>Reacci&oacute;n de p&aacute;nico en respuesta a cambios en el medio ambiente.  Hay diferentes tipos de des&oacute;rdenes psiqui&aacute;tricos severos. El nombre espec&iacute;fico de la enfermedad y su severidad depender&aacute; de la combinaci&oacute;n de s&iacute;ntomas descritos anteriormente.
</UL>
<P>Los trastornos psiqui&aacute;tricos severos duran mucho tiempo y a veces por toda la vida. Sin embargo en muchos casos, cuando el tratamiento comienza temDrano, la salud y capacidad para llevar a cabo las tareas del diario vlvir me&#93;ora.
<P>Cuando los padres sospechen que su hijo puede tener un desorden psiqui&aacute;trico serio deben buscar un especialista a la mayor brevedad posible para hacerle una evaluaci&oacute;n completa al ni&ntilde;o. Los padres, pediatras, maestros y otras personas en continuo contacto con el ni&ntilde;o deben obervar y compararlo con otros de su edad. Sus observaciones pueden ser de gran utilidad en la evaluaci&oacute;n inicial del caso.
<P>Para una evaluaci&oacute;n y plan de tratamiento completo hay que contar con la participacion de un Psiquiatra de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes. Este integrar&aacute; y coordinar&aacute; sus hallazgos con los de los padres, educadores especializados, pediatras, neur&oacute;logos y los resultados de pruebas esneciales del desarrollo y psicol&oacute;gicas, Un tratamiento adecuado incluye la coordinaci&oacute;n de algunos de los siguientes:
<UL>
<LI>Psicoterapia
<LI>Programas de educaci&oacute;n especial
<LI>Programas para desarrollar destrezas sociales y de conducta
<LI>Medicaci&oacute;n
<LI>Escuelas especiales u hospitalarias
<LI>Participaci&oacute;n activa de la familia en el proceso
</UL>
<P>El diagn&oacute;stico e intervenci&oacute;n de los des&oacute;rdenes psiqui&aacute;tricos severos en los ni&ntilde;os es una tarea muy dif&iacute;cil ya que ellos y la condici&oacute;n misma cambian mucho a medida que el desarrollo progresa. Es por tanto necesario que participen m&eacute;dicos que han recibido el entrenamiento apropiado y tienen la experiencia adecuada para evaluar e intervenir lo antes eosible.

<H1>DEPRESION EN LOS NI&Ntilde;OS</H1>
<P>Cuando hablamos sobre depresi&oacute;n como estado de &aacute;nimo o trastorno emocionalgeneralmente pensamos que &eacute;sta solo ocurre en las personas adultas. Los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os eval&uacute;an y tratan ni&ntilde;os que sufren de depresi&oacute;n severa. Depresi&oacute;n es un estado de &aacute;nimo donde hay una tristeza sostenida con p&eacute;rdida de energ&iacute;a e inter&eacute;s que se considera como un trastorno emocional si su duraci&oacute;n se prolonga por varios meses. A pesar de que es un desorden relativamente com&uacute;n, el mismo pasa inadvertido por ser poco entendido tanto por los padres como por los profesionales. Se calcula que un 10% de todos los ni&ntilde;os sufren alg&uacute;n tipo de sintomatolog&iacute;a depresiva antes de los doce (12) a&ntilde;os de edad.
<P>La depresi&oacute;n en los ni&ntilde;os y los adolescentes puede manifestarse de forma diferente a la depresi&oacute;n en los adultos. Muchas veces su expresi&oacute;n puede ser cubierta (disfrazada, enmascarada) por la presencia de otros s&iacute;ntomas asociados como la hiperactividad, la conducta agresiva, las quejas f&iacute;sicas o el ausentismo escolar. Aunque estos s&iacute;ntomas no son espec&iacute;ficos pueden estar asociados a otros des&oacute;rdenes. Cuando el ni&ntilde;o sufre de depresi&oacute;n en ocasiones puede aparecer triste o hasta expresar verbalmente sus sentimientos o pensamientos depresivos.  Los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os recomiendan a los padres que busquen indicios recurrentes de depresi&oacute;n en los ni&ntilde;os, como el deterioro en su funcionamiento acad&eacute;mico o aburrimiento persistente. Otra se&ntilde;al puede ser cambios en la conducta. Por ejemplo, el ni&ntilde;o que antes compart&iacute;a y jugaba con sus amiguitos ahora comienza a pasar el tiempo solo; puede haber cambios en su patr&oacute;n de comer o de dormir (aumentar o disminuir). Aquellas cosas que antes le proporcionaban placer, ahora las disfruta poco o nada y comienza a alejarse de ellas.
<P>Ya que un ni&ntilde;o deprimido sufre, necesita ayuda y puede ser ayudado. El diagn&oacute;stico o intervenci&oacute;n temprana puede ayudarle a manejar la depresi&oacute;n. Para ayuda, p&iacute;dale al m&eacute;dico de su preferencia que le refiera a un psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os. Este es el m&eacute;dico que est&aacute; preparado y tiene los conocimientos adecuados para diagnosticar y manejar la depresi&oacute;n en su ni&ntilde;o.

<H1>CHILDREN AND LYING</H1> 

	Honesty and dishonesty are learned in the home.  Parents are often concerned when their child or adolescent lies.<P>  

<H4>	Lying that is probably not a serious problem:</H4>
	Young children (ages 4-5) often make up stories and tell tall tales.  This is normal activity because they enjoy hearing stories and making up stories for fun.  These young children may blur the distinction between reality and fantasy.<P>

	An older child or adolescent may tell a lie to be self-serving (e.g. avoid doing something or deny responsibility for their actions).  Parents should respond to isolated instances of lying by talking with the youngster about the importance of truthfulness, honesty and trust.<P>

	Some adolescents discover that lying may be considered acceptable in certain situations such as not telling a boyfriend or girlfriend the real reasons for breaking up because they don't want to hurt their feelings.  Other adolescents may lie to protect their privacy or to help them feel psychologically separate and independent from their parents  (e.g. denying they sneaked out late at night with friends).<P>


<H4>	Lying that may indicate emotional problems:</H4>
	Some children, who know the difference between truthfulness and lying, tell elaborate stories which appear believable.  Children or adolescents usually relate these stories with enthusiasm because they receive a lot of attention as they tell the lie.<P>

	Other children or adolescents, who otherwise seem responsible, fall into a pattern of repetitive lying.  They often feel that lying is the easiest way to deal with the demands of parents, teachers and friends.  These children are usually not trying to be bad or malicious but the repetitive pattern of lying becomes a bad habit.<P>

	There are also some children and adolescents who are not bothered by lying or taking advantage of others.  Other adolescents may frequently use lying to cover up another serious problem.  For example, an adolescent with a serious drug or alcohol problem will lie repeatedly to hide the truth about where they have been, who they were with, what they were doing, and where the money went.<P>


<H4>	What to do if a Child or Adolescent lies:</H4>
	Parents are the most important role models for their children.  When a child or adolescent lies, parents should take some time to have a serious talk and discuss:
<UL>
<LI>The difference between make believe and reality, lying and telling the truth
<LI>The importance of honesty at home and in the community
<LI>Alternatives to lying
</UL>

	If a child or adolescent develops a pattern of lying which is serious and repetitive, then professional help may be indicated.  Evaluation by a child and adolescent psychiatrist would help the child and parents understand the lying behavior and would also provide recommendations for the future.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN WHO STEAL</H1> 

	When a child or teenager steals, parents are naturally concerned.  They worry about what caused their child to steal, and they wonder whether their son or daughter is a "juvenile delinquent."<P>

	It is normal for a very young child to take something which excites interest.  This cannot be regarded as stealing until the youngster is old enough--usually three to five--to understand that something belongs to a particular person.  Parents should actively teach their children about property rights and the consideration of others.<P>

	Although they have learned that theft is wrong, older children or teenagers steal for various reasons.  A youngster may steal to make things equal if a brother or sister seems to be favored with affection or gifts.  Sometimes, a child may steal as a show of bravery to friends, or to give presents and become more popular at school.<P>

	Parents should consider whether the child has stolen out of a need for more attention.  In such cases, the child may be expressing anger or trying to "get even" with the parents; the stolen object may become a substitute for affection.  The parents should make an effort to give more recognition to the child as an important family member.<P>

	If parents take the proper measures, in most cases the stealing stops as the child grows older.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists recommend that when parents find out their child has stolen, they:
<UL>
<LI>Tell the child that stealing is wrong.
<LI>Help the youngster to pay for or return the stolen object.
<LI>Make sure that the child does not benefit from the theft under any circumstances.
<LI>Avoid lecturing, predicting future bad behavior or saying that they now consider the child to be a thief.
<LI>Make clear that this behavior is totally unacceptable within the family tradition and the community. 
</UL>
	When the child has paid for or returned the stolen merchandise, the matter should not be brought up again by the parents, so that the child can begin again with a "clean slate."<P>

	If stealing is persistent and thefts continue despite these measures, the stealing probably results from more serious problems in the child's emotional development.  Children who repeatedly steal have difficulty trusting others and forming close relationships.  Rather than feeling guilty, they blame the behavior on others, with the argument that, "Since they refuse to give me what I need, I will take it."  Some children steal out of a fear of dependency; they wish not to depend on anyone, so they take what they need.<P>

	In treating a child who steals persistently, a child and adolescent psychiatrist will diagnose the underlying reasons for the need to steal, and plan a program of treatment.  Important aspects of treatment are helping the child learn to establish trusting relationships and helping the family to support the child in changing to a more healthy path of development.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN AND GRIEF</H1>

	When a family member dies, children react differently from adults.  Preschool children usually see death as temporary and reversible--a belief reinforced by cartoon characters who "die" and "come to life" again.  Children between five and nine begin to think more like adults about death, yet they still believe it will never happen to them or anyone they know.<P>

	Adding to a child's shock and confusion at the death of a brother, sister or parent is the unavailability of other family members, who may be so shaken by grief that they are notable to cope with the normal responsibility of child care.<P>

	Parents should be aware of normal childhood responses to a death in the family, as well as danger signals.  According to child and adolescent psychiatrists, it is normal during the weeks following the death for some children to feel immediate grief or persist in the belief that the family member is still alive.  But long-term denial of the death or avoidance of grief is unhealthy and can later surface in more severe problems.<P>

	A child who is frightened about attending a funeral should not be forced to go; however, some service or observance is recommended, such as lighting a candle, saying a prayer or visiting a grave site.<P>

	Once children accept the death, they are likely to display their feelings of sadness on and off over a long period of time, and often at unexpected moments.  The surviving relatives should spend as much time as possible with the child, making it clear that the child has permission to show his or her feelings openly or freely.<P>

	The person who has died was essential to the stability of the child's world, and anger is a natural reaction.  The anger may be revealed in boisterous play, nightmares, irritability or a variety of other behaviors.  Often the child will show anger towards the surviving family members.<P>

	After a parent dies, many children will act younger than they are.  The child may temporarily become more infantile, demanding food, attention and cuddling, and talking "baby talk."<P>

	Younger children believe they are the cause of what happens around them.  A young child may believe a parent, grandparent, brother or sister died because he or she had once "wished" the person dead.   The child feels guilty because the wish "came true."  Some danger signals to watch for:
<UL>
<LI>An extended period of depression in which the child loses interest in daily activities and events.
<LI>Inability to sleep, loss of appetite, prolonged fear of being alone.
<LI>Acting much younger for an extended period.
<LI>Excessively imitating the dead person; repeated statements of wanting to join the dead person.
<LI>Withdrawal from friends.
<LI>Sharp drop in school performance or refusal to attend school.
</UL>
	These warning signs indicate that professional help may be needed.  A child and adolescent psychiatrist can help the child accept the death and assist the survivors in helping the child through the mourning process.<P>

<H1>PROBLEMS WITH SOILING & BOWEL CONTROL</H1>	

	 Most children can control their bowels and are toilet trained by the time they   are four years of age.  Problems controlling bowel movements can cause soiling   which leads to frustration and anger on part of the child, parents, teachers and other   people important in the child's life.  In addition, social difficulties with this problem   can be severe -- the child is often made fun of by friends and avoided by adults.  These problems can cause children to feel badly about themselves.
	Some of the reasons for soiling are:
<OL>
<LI>problems during toilet training,
<LI>physical disabilities, which make it hard for the child to clean him/herself,
<LI>physical illnesses, for example Hirschprung's Disease,
<LI>family or emotional problems.
</OL>

	 Soiling which is not caused by an illness or disability is called encopresis.  Children with encopresis may have other problems, such as short attention span, low   frustration tolerance, hyperactivity and poor coordination.  Occasionally, this problem   with soiling starts with a stressful change in the child's life, such as the birth of a   sibling, separation/divorce of parents, family problems, or a move to a new home.  Encopresis is more common in boys than in girls.<P>

	 School-age children with soiling or bowel control problems should have a   complete physical evaluation by a family physician or pediatrician.  If no physical   causes are found, or if problems continue after examination by a family physician, the   next step is an evaluation by a child and adolescent psychiatrist.  The child and   adolescent psychiatrist will review the results of the physical evaluation and   then decide whether emotional problems are contributing to the encopresis.   <P>

Child and adolescent psychiatrists treat encopresis with a combination of educational, psychological and behavioral methods.  Most children with encopresis can be helped, but progress can be slow and extended treatment may be necessary.  Early treatment of asoiling or bowel control problem can help prevent and reduce social and emotional suffering and pain for the child and family.<P>

<H1>PANIC DISORDER IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS</H1>

Panic disorder is a common and treatable disorder.  Children and adolescents     with panic disorder have unexpected and repeated periods of intense fear or discomfort, along with other symptoms such as a racing heartbeat or feeling short of breath.  These periods are called "panic attacks" and last minutes to hours.  Panic attacks frequently develop without warning.  Symptoms of a panic attack include:
<UL>
<LI>Intense fearfulness (a sense that something terrible is happening)
<LI>Racing or pounding heartbeat
<LI>Dizziness or lightheadedness
<LI>Shortness of breath or a feeling of smothering
<LI>Trembling or shaking
<LI>Sense of unreality
<LI>Fear of dying, losing control, or going crazy
</UL>

	More than 3 million Americans will experience panic disorder during their lifetime.  Panic disorder often begins during adolescence, although it may start during childhood, and sometimes runs in families.<P>

	  If not recognized and treated, panic disorder and its complications can be devastating.  Panic attacks can interfere with a child's or adolescent's relationships, schoolwork, and normal development.  Children and adolescents with panic disorder may begin to feel anxious most of the time, even when they are not having panic attacks.  Some begin to avoid situations where they fear a panic attack may occur, or situations where help may not be available.  For example, a child may be reluctant to go to school or be separated from his or her parents.  In severe cases, the child or adolescent may be afraid to leave home.  This pattern of avoiding certain places or situations is called "agoraphobia."  Some children and adolescents with panic disorder can develop severe depression and may be at risk of suicidal behavior.  As an attempt to decrease anxiety, some adolescents with panic disorder will use alcohol or drugs.<P>

	Panic disorder in children can be hard to diagnose.  This can lead to many visits to physicians and multiple medical tests which are expensive and potentially painful.  When properly evaluated and diagnosed, panic disorder usually responds well to treatment.  Children and adolescents with symptoms of panic attacks should first be evaluated by their family physician or pediatrician.  If no other physical illness or condition is found as a cause for the symptoms, a comprehensive evaluation by a child and adolescent psychiatrist should be obtained.<P>

	Several types of treatment are effective.  Specific medications may stop panic attacks. Psychotherapy may also help the child and family learn ways to reduce stress or conflict that could otherwise cause a panic attack.  With techniques taught in "cognitive behavioral therapy" or "biofeedback therapy," the child may also learn new ways to control anxiety or panic attacks when they occur.  Many children and adolescents with panic disorder respond well to the combination of medication and psychotherapy.  With treatment, the panic attack scan usually be stopped.  Early treatment can prevent the complications of panic disorder such as agoraphobia, depression and substance abuse.  For more information about panic disorder, contact the National Institute of Mental Health Panic Campaign, Room 15C-05, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD,  20857, or call, 1-800-64-PANIC.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN'S SLEEP PROBLEMS</H1> 

	Many children have sleep problems.  Examples include frequent awakening during the night, talking during sleep, difficulty falling asleep, waking up crying, feeling sleepy during the day, or having nightmares.  Bedwetting is another nighttime problem.*<P>

	Most childhood sleep problems are related to irregular sleep habits or to anxiety about going to bed and falling asleep.  Sleep problems may also be symptoms of emotional difficulties.  "Separation anxiety" is a developmental landmark for young children.  For normal young children, bedtime is a time of separation:  Some children will do all they can to prevent separation. <P>

	To help minimize these types of common sleep problems, child and adolescent psychiatrists recommend that parents be consistent.  They should view sleep as a useful habit and develop regular routines. <P>

	Parents often find that feeding and rocking help an infant to get to sleep.  However, as the child leaves infancy, parents should encourage the child to sleep without feeding and rocking.  Otherwise, the developing child will have a hard time going to sleep alone. <P>

	Nightmares are relatively common.  The child remembers nightmares, which usually involve major threats to the child's well-being.  Nightmares, which being at a variety of ages, affect girls more often than boys.  For some, nightmares are serious and frequent. <P>

	Sleep terrors, sleepwalking and sleep talking constitute a relatively rare group of sleep disorders, called "parasomnias." <P>

	Sleep terrors are different from nightmares.  The child with sleep terrors will scream uncontrollably and appear to be awake, but is confused and can't communicate.  Sleep terrors usually begin between ages 4 and 12.     * See Facts For Families, no. 18 on "Bedwetting". <P>

	Children who sleepwalk may appear to be awake as they move around, but are actually asleep and in danger of hurting themselves.  Sleepwalking usually begins between ages 6 and 12.  Both sleep terrors and sleepwalking run in families and affect boys more often than girls. <P>

	Most often, children with parasomnias have single or occasional episodes of these disorders.  However, when episodes occur several times a night, or nightly for weeks at a time, or interfere with the child's daytime behavior, treatment by a child and adolescent psychiatrist may be necessary.  A range of treatments is available. <P>

	Fortunately, as they mature, children usually get over common sleep problems as well as the more serious disorders.  However, parents with urgent concerns should contact their pediatrician or directly seek consultation with a child and adolescent psychiatrist. <P>

<IMG vspace=4 SRC= "/web/images/dot_clear.gif"> <BR>
The following terms are those most frequently used when dealing with the congressional
legislative process. A passing familiarity with this glossary will enable you to effectively
communicate with members of Congress.<p>


<IMG vspace=4 SRC= "/web/images/dot_clear.gif"> <BR>


<b>Act </b>A bill after it has been signed into law.<p>


<p>


<b>Adjournment</b> Congress ends a legislative day (which can last longer than 24 hours) by
adjournment. To adjourn sine die means to conclude a legislative day without setting a day to
reconvene (which usually happens at the end of a session).<p>


<p>


<b>Advice and Consent</b> The Constitution mandates that the president secure the advice and consent
of the Senate in treaties, which requires a two-thirds' majority of those present, and for executive
and judicial appointments, which require a simple majority of those present.<p>


<p>


<b>Amendment</b> A change of a bill, motion, act, or the Constitution .<p>


<p>


<b>Appropriation</b> A formal approval to draw funds from the Treasury for specific purposes.<p>


<p>


<b>Authorization</b> A law creating a program and out lining funding. The authorization to actually
draw funds from the Treasury and the amount to be drawn are established by an appropriation.<p>


<p>


<b>Bill</b> A proposed law.<p>


<p>


<b>Budget</b> The president's annual proposal to Congress, usually submitted in January, for federal
expenditures and revenues for the coming fiscal year (which starts October 1).<p>


<p>


<b>Budget Authority</b> Allows the federal government to incur a financial liability, typically a contract
for direct payment, a loan, or a loan guarantee.<p>


<p>


<b>Budget Resolution</b> House- and Senate-passed guidelines, and later caps, on federal budget
authority and outlays. The Budget Resolution is not submitted to the president for signature or
veto. It is considered a matter of internal congressional rules and procedure. Bills that would
exceed budget caps are subject to a point of order--although waivers have been granted regularly
in both House and Senate.<p>


<p>


<b>Clerk of the House</b> The chief administrative officer of the House of Representatives, responsible
for taking votes, certifying passage, printing and distributing legislative documents, and internal
budgeting and accounting .<p>


<p>


<b>Cloture. </b>Closing off debate. The Senate put an end to unlimited debate in 1917 when it provided
that two-thirds of those present may invoke the "rule of cloture" and set a time limit for
discussion. In 1975, support necessary for cloture was changed to three fifths of the entire Senate;
in 1979, a 100-hour cap on debate was imposed after cloture was invoked to limit the use of
delaying amendments.<p>


<b>Committee of the Whole Expediting Procedures.</b>  A different set of legislative rules apply
when the House resolves itself into "the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the
Union." Only 100 Members need to be present to conduct business, rather than 218; after general
debate, members can speak on individual amendments for only 5 minutes, rather than an hour; the
kinds of motions that may be made are more limited than under general House rules; and the
speaker designates a chairman to preside over the proceedings rather than preside himself.
Historically, voting in Committee of the Whole was secret, but the House began permitting
recorded votes in 1971. Votes on final passage usually occur after the Committee as a Whole has
"risen"--dissolved itself. The Senate generally limits the use of the Committee of the Whole to
treaty ratifications. <p>


<p>


<b>Conferees/Conference Committee</b> The House and Senate appoint conferees to a conference
committee to resolve differences between House- and Senate passed versions of the same
legislation. The speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader appoint conferees, although,
by tradition, they usually appoint majority and minority members--in a five-to-two ratio-- from the
committees that had jurisdiction over the legislation .<p>


<p>


<b>Congressional Record </b>A verbatim report of all that is said and done in the House and Senate
(although members have an opportunity to revise their remarks before publication), except for
executive sessions. Whole speeches that are inserted into the Record often have not been
delivered on the floor. An appendix contains material from representatives not spoken on the floor
but published by permission--"extensions of remarks."<p>


<p>


<b>Continuing Resolution</b> Legislative vehicle to continue government funding usually at current
levels. Used in lieu of appropriations bills that have not been passed.<p>


<p>


<b>Executive Session</b> A meeting closed to the public.<p>


<p>


<b>Filibuster</b> Delaying tactics to prevent action on a bill. In the Senate, which has a tradition of
"extended" debate, a member may filibuster by speaking con tinuously (reading from the
telephone directory, if it is so desired). But a member also retains the floor while yielding to a
colleague for a question or by calling for the presence of a quorum (which necessitates a roll call).
If the Senate recesses, a member regains the floor when the Senate reconvenes. In the House,
filibustering is more difficult because members are ordinarily prohibited from speaking more than
one hour and most legislation is considered while the House is in Committee of the Whole, which
restricts the kinds of motions which may be offered.<p>


<p>


<b>Fiscal Year</b> The federal government's fiscal year runs from October 1 through September 30.<p>


<p>


<b>Franking Privilege</b> The right of a senator, representative, or member of the federal government
to use the U.S. Postal Service free for official business.<p>


<p>


<b>Germaneness </b>House rules require that amendments to a bill must relate to the subject matter
under consideration, that they be germane. Any member may raise a point of order that an
amendment is nongermane and should be ruled out of order. However, the speaker has
considerable discretion in ruling on germaneness points of order, which, by deciding which
amendments are or are not to be considered, gives him a powerful tool to shape legislation. The
House, by majority vote, often accepts the recommendation of its Rules Committee that specified
nongermane amendments be permitted. This gives the Rules Committee, which is usually
controlled by the majority leadership, considerable power to push its legislative agenda by
combining unrelated items. In the Senate, the majority party has far less power to control the
legislative agenda. Amendments do not have to be germane un less they are offered to a general
appropriations bill. Even then, the Senate can decide to accept them as germane by a simple
majority vote. All amendments offered after cloture has been invoked, however, must be germane.<p>


<p>


<b>Majority Leader</b> The leader of the majority party in the Senate is called the majority leader. The
major of leader in the House is second in command of the majority party, after the speaker.<p>


<p>


<b>Mark-Up</b> A committee or subcommittee drafting session where proposed legislation is amended.<p>


<p>


<b>Minority Leader</b> Leader of the minority party in the House or Senate.<p>


<p>


<b>Pairing</b> Members of Congress who are going to be absent for an important vote will often "pair"
with another member who would have voted for the opposite side, on matters where a two-thirds'
majority is required, two members in the affirmative pair with one in the negative. Pairing is
recorded in the Congressional ~Record but is not included in the voting results. A "live" part of a
live pair occurs when a paired member is on the floor and votes "present." House rules provide
guidelines for pairing. The Senate considers the practice a voluntary arrangement among Senators
and the "live" pair is counted for purposes of deter mining whether a quorum is present and
business may be conducted.<p>


<p>


<b>Point of Order</b> An objection by a member of Congress that the pending matter or proceeding is
in violation of the rules. The presiding officer accepts or rejects the objection, subject to appeal to
the full House or Senate. The power of the presiding officer to rule on points of order, however,
is stronger in the House than the Senate.<p>


<p>


<b>President Pro Tempore</b> The temporary presiding officer of the Senate, who serves when the
Vice President of the United States is absent (which is most of the time).<p>


<p>


<b>Previous Question</b> Members of the House of Representatives may cut off debate and force a
vote on an amendment or bll by a motion to "move the previous question"--but not when sitting in
the Committee of the Whole. Moving the previous question is not permitted in the Senate. <p>


<p>


<b>Privilege </b>Certain kinds of business are considered privileged, and take precedence over other
bills, motions, and questions. Appropriations bills in the House, for example, may be reported
from committee and brought to the floor with little or no delay. Questions pertaining to the
conduct of members, and the safety, dignity, or integrity of proceedings, are considered
privileged.<p>


<p>


<b>Private Bills</b> Legislation that would benefit individuals or business entities. The House and
Senate have different rules for considering private bills.<p>


<p>


<b>Quorum </b>A majority of members duly chosen and sworn, 218 in the House and 51 in the Senate
(in the absence of deaths or resignations). A quorum is necessary to conduct business. Senators
may object to the absence of a quorum at almost any time, which makes quorum roll calls an
integral part of Senate parliamentary tactics. House rules are more restrictive, especially while
sitting in Committee of the Whole. The presiding officer often controls quorum calls, using the
delay to further his legislative goals.<p>


<b>Ranking Minority Member</b> First in seniority on a committee, of the minority party.<p>


<p>


<b>Recess</b> Concludes legislative day, with a set time for reconvening--usually more than three days of
adjournment .<p>


<p>


<b>Reconciliation</b> Process by which the authorizing committees in the House and Senate change the
various programs they administer in order to meet the federal budget target figures.<p>


<p>


<b>Report </b>A printed record of a committee's actions and views on a particular bill or matter. Copies
may be obtained from the clerk of the House or the secretary of the Senate.<p>


<p>


<b>Rider </b>A legislative rider is an unrelated item that is attached to a bill so it may " ride" to approval.
Because of the germaneness rules, riders are more common in the Senate than the House. Riders
are often attached to appropriations bills.<p>


<p>


<b>Secretary of the Senate</b> The chief administrative officer of the Senate, responsible for taking
votes, certifying passage, printing and distributing documents, and internal budgeting and
accounting.<p>


<p>


<b>Senatorial Courtesy</b> The tradition of allowing senators of the president's party to veto
presidential appointments in or nominations from their own states.<p>


<p>


<b>Speaker of the House</b> Presiding officer of the House, leader of the majority party in the House
(al though there is no constitutional requirement that the speaker be a representative), and next in
line to the vice president for succession to the presidency. The speaker is one of the most
powerful offices in Washington.<p>


<p>


<b>Suspension of the Rules</b> An expedited procedure for considering legislation in the House. Time
for debate is severely restricted, no floor amendments are allowed, but a two-thirds' majority is
required for passage.<p>


<p>


<b>Tabling Motion </b>A proposal to remove a bill from immediate consideration. It is often used to kill
a measure.<p>


<p>


<b>Unanimous Consent</b> Almost any rule in the House or Senate can be overlooked by unanimous
consent. The Senate relies on unanimous consent agreements to define legislative ground rules for
particular measures, which protects the rights of the minority party and forces members to work
with one another. The House uses unanimous consent agreements relatively sparingly--usually to
adopt a noncontroversial mea sure--and legislative ground rules are set by majority, often
party-line, vote.<p>

<center><H3>President Announces His FY 1998 Budget<BR>SSA Announces New SSI Regulations</H3></center>
<P><BR>
Last week, the President unveiled his five-year spending plan that includes increases in NIH, Medicare, Medicaid, juvenile justice and education programs, <B>and a new children's health initiative</B>.  This is the first step of a six-month process to determine federal spending for fiscal year 1998 and beyond.  The overall goal of his spending plan is to balance the budget in five years, something that has not been done since 1969.  With increases in education and juvenile justice programs, and the new children's health initiative, the President's recommendations attempt to counter some of the negative aspects of the welfare reform.  Congress has indicated it will seriously consider the budget rather than draft separate proposals.
<P>
<B>Children's Health Initiative</B>  The budget proposes a five-year $18.4 billion children's health initiative that would expand health care coverage to 5 million of the 10 million uninsured children.  <BR>
The initiative would:
<ul>
<li>Give annual grants to states to cover health insurance premiums, for up to six months, for children who are at risk because their parents change jobs.  

<li>Provide states with $3.8 billion over the next five years to develop innovative approaches to help working families who earn too much for Medicaid but too little to afford private coverage buy.

<li>Allow states to extend Medicaid coverage for one year to eligible children with parents who are changing jobs, moving from welfare to work, or remarrying.
</ul>
The Department of Health and Human Services, if approved would work states, advocacy groups, providers, and businesses to identify and enroll the 3 million children who are eligible but not enrolled in Medicaid.
<P>
<B>Medicare & Medicaid</B>  The budget proposes an 8 percent increase in Medicare and 7.4 percent increase in Medicaid.  Medicare's annual inflation increases for hospitals would be reduced, and graduate medical education payments would be adjusted.  A per-capita cap is proposed on Medicaid grants to states to save $9 billion over the next five years.  Because of the cap, states will receive more flexibility in managing their Medicaid programs, such as allowing states to mandate enrollment in managed care plans without going through the Federal waiver process, eliminating Federal provider payment requirements for hospitals and nursing homes, and allowing states to provide continuous coverage to children for one year after eligibility.
<P>
<B>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</B>  The President's 1998 request for NIH is $13.1 billion, an increase of 2.6% over the FY 1997 level.  The National Institute for Mental Health is recommended to receive an increase of $26 million, from $604 million in FY 1997 to $630 million.  The National Institute for Drug Abuse recommendation doubled, receiving the biggest increase based on a $30 million recommendation jump over FY 1997 levels.  This 9% increase reflects the Administration's plan for a coordinated approach to combating drug abuse.  The National Institute on Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse would receive an increase of $7 million in the President's budget.
<P>
<B>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)</B>  The President's FY 1998 level for SAMHSA totals $2.2 billion, with a very modest increase of $35 million or 1.5 percent over the FY 1997. Most Center for Mental Health Programs (CMHS) are maintained at their FY 1997 levels.  This includes the $275 million for the Mental Health Block Grant and $70 million for the Children's Mental Health Services Program. Due to the large number of persons now covered in managed mental health plans, the President has requested $445 million to support the Federal government's roles in the mental health services field.    An additional $10 million was requested for the Substance Abuse Performance Partnership Block Grant.
<P>
<B>Education</B>  In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton deemed education the top priority of his second term.  In his FY 1998 budget, spending for education will increase 13 percent.  This will cut across every major program the department manages. Special education programs would receive an increase of $173 million or 4.3 percent over FY 1997 levels.
<P>
<B>Juvenile Justice</B>  The proposed Justice Department's budget would increase nearly 5 percent.  This includes $233 million in spending to combat violent crime by gang members and other young criminals, with about half the money designated for a grant program that would provide funding, training, and equipment for local prosecutors who specialize in this area.  If the President's budget is accepted, this will mark a 70 percent rise in the Justice Department's budget since he took office.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>New SSI Regulations Released</FONT></CENTER>
<BR>
In February, the Social Security Administration finally released new regulations for the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.  The regulations were required by the welfare reform law passed by Congress last August.  As expected a large number of children will be removed from the rolls.  Of the children being reviewed, SSA estimates that 135,000 will lose their eligibility.  Key aspects of the new regulations are:
<ul>
<li> A new definition of childhood disability.  Children must have a "medically determinable physical or mental impairment which results in marked and severe functional limitations" of substantial duration to qualify for disability benefits.
<P>
<li>Elimination of the Individualized Functional Assessment (IFA) which determined eligibility by comparing a child's limitations in various daily activities to the activities of children the same age who do not have a disability.  Children will now qualify through the more restrictive medical listings.
<P>
<li>The medical listings will be modified to eliminate references to "maladaptive behavior" for children with mental impairments. Previously maladaptive behavior was counted in two domains: social and personal/behavioral functioning.  The new regulations instruct disability examiners to only consider evidence of this limitation when evaluating a child's social functioning.  
<P>
<li>Current recipients will continue to receive benefits until July 1, 1997, or the date of redetermination, if it is later.
<P>
<li>State medical assistance agencies have been instructed to continue Medicaid while SSA reviews a child's SSI eligibility and throughout the appeal process if a child challenges the denial of SSI benefits.  The President's budget proposes that Congress allocate funds to continue Medicaid to children who lose their SSI benefits due to the program changes.
<P>
<li>Every three years, children will have their cases reviewed unless their condition is not expected to improve.
</ul>

<B>Sample letter:</B><BR>
Dear Representative/Senator:
<P>
As a constituent, and a child and adolescent psychiatrist, I urge you to support children's health care legislation that provides universal access for children, with nondiscriminatory coverage for mental illnesses. Today, there are 10 million American children without health insurance of children are uninsured.  Over half of these uninsured children are from families in which one or both parents work, but where the parent's coverage may not extend to their dependents.  
<P>
The treatment of childhood disorders represents a major public health concern.  Chronic mental illnesses respond well to treatment, but lifelong access to the health care system is necessary. Successful diagnosis and treatment is a wise investment, given the pain, long-term disadvantages, and financial costs associated with untreated childhood behavioral and emotional disorders.  I urge you to support the development of a bill that will provide universal nondiscriminatory health care coverage to all children.
<P>
Sincerely,
(Your name), M.D.
<P><BR>
<B>Talking points:</B>
<ul>
<li>There are currently about 10 million American children who do not receive health insurance coverage.  Over three million are eligible for, but are not receiving Medicaid, and seven million -- the vast majority of uninsured children -- are from families in which one or both parents work, but where the parent's coverage may not extend to their dependents. 
<P>
<li>Mental illnesses are treatable, and with successful diagnosis and treatment, most children and adolescents with mental illnesses can lead productive lives.
<P>
<li>Children are not just small adults, they need coverage tailored for their needs. For example, children with mental illnesses seldom need hospitalization, but when they do, it is usually for a longer period of time than allowed under current coverage.  Whereas, physical illnesses are not limited to a specific number of inpatient days. Any universal coverage should include the availability of an integrated system of care for children and adolescents provides the range of services needed for an individual treatment plan, which may include partial hospitalization, home and school based services, and therapeutic foster care.
</ul>

<FONT SIZE=+1>State Parity Activity</FONT> - Parity legislation at the state level will be on many legislators' agendas this year.  Several statehouses are already considering bills.  Parity legislation is expected in VT, PA, OH, ND, TX, CO, FL, KS, and UT.  Legislative language in these proposals often provides parity to specific mental illnesses; this may not always include the major disorders in children and adolescents.  If you reside in one of these states, it is very important that you contact your state legislators and urge them to include all childhood psychiatric disorders in the parity proposal.  If your state is considering parity legislation, please contact the Academy's Department of Government Affairs.

<BR>
<BR>
As the 105th Congress begins its work, several legislators are preparing to sponsor proposals that
would extend health care coverage to the 10 million uninsured children in this country. These
legislators are not alone in expressing their concern about children and adolescents without
insurance.  <strong>The Academy's Executive Committee, anticipating the need to focus attention
on children endangered by the welfare reform law, has chosen universal access to health
care as the Academy's top legislative priority.</strong>  The Academy's leaders are asking AACAP
members to adopt this priority and be a part of a grassroots effort to contact their legislators early
in this Congressional session.

<P>
Last year, Congress approved health insurance reforms to end discriminatory practices when
employees change jobs or have pre-existing conditions.   Efforts to end discrimination against
coverage for mental illnesses were partially successful when legislators mandated equal annual and
lifetime limits where mental and physical illnesses are covered.  Legislators and the White House
appear to agree that insurance for all youngsters should be the priority health care agenda item. 
<strong>The Academy will ask that all proposals provide parity coverage for mental and physical
illnesses.</strong>

<P>
There are currently 10 million American children who do not receive health insurance coverage. 
Over 3 million are eligible for, but are not receiving Medicaid, and seven million -- the vast
majority of uninsured children -- are from families in which one or both parents work, but where
the parent's coverage may not extend to their dependents.  With the changes to SSI through the
welfare reform law, children taken off the SSI rolls will also lose their eligibility for Medicaid. 
Many of these children have serious emotional disorders.  Below, are the 1994 statistics on the
percentage of uninsured children, by state.
<BR><br wp="br2">
<CENTER><img src="/web/images/map.gif" ></CENTER><br clear=all>
Already, there are three major proposals being considered:



<ol>
  <li><strong>Senators Kennedy (D-MA) and Kerry's (D-MA) proposal</strong> - establishes a subsidy
program to help working families purchase private health insurance for their children
through a group purchasing pool or a private insurance company, both of which would
offer similar comprehensive benefits.  Only families with incomes too high to qualify for
Medicaid would be eligible. The proposal is estimated to cost $24 billion over the first five
years, with the money coming from a 75 cent increase in the cigarette tax.  A full phased-in program would cost about $9 billion a year.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li><strong>Senator Daschle (D-SD) and Representative Gephardt's (D-MO-3) proposal</strong> -
mandates that all insurers that do business with the federal government offer affordable
and accessible policies for children up to age 13.  Benefits covered would be equivalent to
those contained in current packages and consumer protections, including no discrimination
based on health status and guaranteed renewability will be mandated.  Assistance to cover
a portion of the cost of the premium will come in the form of tax relief and premium
subsidies.  The proposal has not been scored by the Congressional Budget Office, but may
weigh in at half the cost of the Kennedy/Kerry proposal.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li><strong>Representative Stark's (D-CA-13) proposal</strong> - mandates all group health plans and
insurers to make coverage available for dependents and other individuals under the age of
21.  Coverage would include all Medicare benefits, newborn and well-baby care, well-child
visits and periodic appointments to monitor the child's development.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li><strong>President Clinton is considering a proposal</strong> to extend a $750 million per year program
to cover "gap" kids, who are not eligible for Medicaid and who are without access to
private insurance.</li>
</ol>
<br wp="br2">
<P><strong><u>What's Being Done:</u></strong>
<P>
The Academy has already taken the lead on writing the "<I>Principles and Recommendations for
Legislation</I>," for the National Consortium for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. The
first of five principles is<strong> universal non-discriminatory access to health care treatment and
services.  </strong>The document was sent to all members of Congress with an endorsement from 18 of
the 23 national organizations represented in the Consortium.  If you would like to receive a copy
of the "<I>Principles and Recommendations for Legislation,</I>" please call Kristin Kroeger at 1-800-333-7636.

<P>
The Department of Government Affairs is planning these additional actions to support passage of
universal access to health care for children:

<H1>TEENAGERS with EATING DISORDERS</H1> 
	Overeating related to tension, poor nutritional habits and food fads are relatively common eating problems for youngsters.  In addition, two psychiatric eating disorders, anorexia nervosa and bulimia, are on the increase among teenage girls and young women.  These two disorders also occur in boys, but much less often.  The child and adolescent psychiatrist is trained to evaluate, diagnose, and treat these psychiatric disorders which are characterized by a preoccupation with food.
	Parents frequently ask how to identify symptoms of anorexia nervosa and bulimia.  The fact is that many teenagers are for many months or years successful in hiding these serious and sometimes fatal disorders from their families.<P>
	Parents should be on the lookout for various symptoms and warning signs of anorexia nervosa and bulimia:<P>
<UL>
<LI>A teenager with anorexia nervosa is typically a perfectionist and a high achiever in school. At the same time, she suffers from low self-esteem, irrationally believing she is fat regardless of how thin she becomes.  Desperately needing a feeling of mastery over her life, the teenager with anorexia nervosa experiences a sense of control only when she says "no" to the normal food demands of her body.  In a relentless pursuit to be thin, the girl starves herself.  This often reaches the point of serious damage to the body, and in a small number of cases may lead to death.
<LI>The symptoms of bulimia are different from those of anorexia nervosa.  The patient binges on huge quantities of high-caloric food and then purges her body of dreaded calories by self-induced vomiting and often by using laxatives.  These binges may alternate with severe diets, resulting in dramatic weight fluctuations.  Teenagers may try to hide the signs of throwing up by running water while spending long periods of time in the bathroom.  The purging of bulimia presents a serious threat to the patient's physical health, including dehydration, hormonal imbalance, the depletion of important minerals, and damage to vital organs.
</UL>	
With proper treatment, teenagers can be relieved of the symptoms or helped to control these disorders.  Parents who notice symptoms of anorexia or bulimia in their teenagers should ask their family physician or pediatrician for a referral to a child and adolescent psychiatrist who works comprehensively in the treatment of these disorders.<P>

<h1>ADOLESCENTES CON TRASTORNOS ALIMENTICIOS</h1>

<P>La Anorexia Nerviosa y la Bulimia son dos tipos de des&oacute;rdenes alimenticios de naturaleza psiqui&aacute;trica que est&aacute;n aumentando entre los adolescentes y las mujeres j&oacute;venes. Los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os est&aacute;n preparados para evaluar, diagnosticar, hacer investigaci&oacute;n y tratar estos tipos de des&oacute;rdenes psiqui&aacute;tricos. Frecuentemente se les pide su ayuda para los adolescentes que sufren de Anorexia Nerviosa y Bulimia, que son des&oacute;rdenes caracterizados por una preocupaci&oacute;n constante por la comida.
<P>Los padres indagan con frecuencia a los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os c&oacute;mo se pueden identificar estos des&oacute;rdenes. Desgraciadamente muchos adolescentes pueden ocultar por meses y a veces por a&ntilde;os con gran &eacute;xito estos serios, y en ocasiones fatales, des&oacute;rdenes.
<P>Los padres deben estar alerta hacia varios s&iacute;ntomas de Anorexia o Bulimia. Describiremos algunos de ellos:
<UL>
<LI>Una adolescente con Anorexia Nerviosa es t&iacute;picamente una persona perfeccionista que sobresale en sus estudios. Al mismo tiempo ella sufre de un senti mi ento bajo de amor propio. Ella tiene la creencia irracional de que est&aacute; gorda sin importar 1o delgada que se encuentre. Ella parece necesitar tener desesperadamente un sentido de dominio sobre su vida personal, por ello es que la adolescente con Anorexia Nerviosa s&oacute;lo percibe este control, cuando dice que no a las exigencias de comida normales para su cuerpo. En la b&uacute;squeda inexorable e irracional por la delgadez, la ni&ntilde;a deja de comer. De un 15 a 20% de las v&iacute;ctimas suelen morir.
<P>
<LI>Los s&iacute;nto mas de Bulimia son diferentes a los de Anorexia Nerviosa. La victima ingiere cantidades enormes de comidas que contienen un alto contenido cal&oacute;rico para luego vaciar su est&oacute;mago induciendo v&oacute;mito o utilizando purgantes con objeto de limpiar o eliminar de su cuerpo las calor&iacute;as que tanto le aterran. Estas org&iacute;as alimenticias pueden ser alternadas con restricciones diet&eacute;ticas severas lo cual puede resultar en fluctuaciones dra m&aacute; ticas en el peso. Las adolescentes pueden tratar de ocultar el h&aacute;bito de vomi tar, utilizando una variedad de t&aacute;cticas: por ejemplo, el pasar largos ratos en el ba&ntilde;o con la regadera o la llave del agua corriendo. Esta acci&oacute;n purgativa puede tener serios resultados nocivos para la salud de la v&iacute;ctima, incluyendo deshidrataci&oacute;n, desequilibrio ho rmonal y baja de minerales importantes.
</UL>
<P>Con el tratamiento apropiado estos adolescentes pueden ser curados de los peligrosos des&oacute;rdenes alimenticios. Si usted nota s&iacute;ntomas de Anorexia o Bulimia en su hijo(a), pida a su m&eacute;dico de familia o pediatra que le refiera a su psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os quien utilizar&aacute; un enfoque global y efectivo para el diagn&oacute;stico y tratami ento de esta enfermedad.

<H1>NORMALITY </H1>

	Parents are naturally concerned about the health and welfare of their children.  Many parents correctly and comfortably see their youngster as normal.  However, some other parents worry whether their infant, child or teenager has a problem.  These worries may be about various things, for example:
<UL>
<LI>How the child is developing;
<LI>The emotional well-being of the child;
<LI>What the child says and thinks; and
<LI>how the child acts--for example, eating and sleeping patterns, behavior at school and getting along with family and friends. 
</UL>
	Child and adolescent psychiatrists can help parents and families sort out whether their child is normal.  They usually examine the child and ask the parents about the child's previous health and behavior.  They may also ask about how the family gets along together.  It is likely that infants, children and teenagers are normal when, at the appropriate age, they enjoy their:
<UL>
<LI>Learning, school and/or work;
<LI>Relationships within the family;
<LI>Relationships with friends; and 
<LI>Play. 
</UL>
	Many parents first discuss their concerns about their child's normality with a family member or friend, or with the child's personal physician, school counselor or member of the clergy--who may then refer the family to a child and adolescent psychiatrist.  He or she listens carefully to the parents and child and sorts out:
<UL>
<LI>The long-term factors that tend to lead to--or protect against--a child's developing problems;
<LI>The short-term factors that set off the child's problem;
<LI>The factors causing these problems to persist;
<LI>The roles of other medical conditions; and
<LI>The combinations of school learning with social and emotional growth.
</UL>
	Based on the evaluation, the child an adolescent psychiatrist may:
<UL>
<LI>Reassure the parents, explaining how they can enhance normal development and be more effective in parenting;
<LI>Suggest activity or an educational program for the child, and/or education for parents, which will support normal developmental processes;
<LI>Provide or arrange for brief counseling to help the child and parents with minor developmental problems, stressful life situations or difficulties of the child's temperament. 
</UL>
	If the evaluation reveals a psychiatric illness, the child and adolescent psychiatrist will recommend a specific treatment program.<P>

	Parents, better than anyone else, know their child and know what is usual behavior for their child.  If there appears to be a problem, seeking professional help may be difficult, but is very important.  It is the first step in knowing for sure whether there is a problem, and if so, what measures will best help the child. <P>

<H1>NORMALIDAD</H1>
<P>Es natural que los padres se preocupen fpor la salud y el bienestar de sus hijos. Muchos perciben a sus hijos como ni&ntilde;os normales. Otros, se preocu&#91;pall por sLbcr si Sll bebe, ni&ntilde;o o adolesccnte tiene alv&uacute;n problema. Estas preocupacioncs pueden estar relacionadas a:

<UL>
<LI>Como se va desarrollando su ni&ntilde;o(a)
<LI>El bienestar emocional del ni&ntilde;o.
<LI>Lo que el ni&ntilde;o dice y piensa, y
<LI>La conducta o h&aacute;bitos del ni&ntilde;o: por ejemlplo, sus patrones alimenticios y de sue&ntilde;o, conducta en la escuela y sus relaciones con la familia y amigos.
</UL>

<P>Los Psiquiatras de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentcs, pueden ayudar a los padres y las familias a determinar si el ni&ntilde;o se desarrolla normalmente. Ellos examinar&aacute;n al ni&ntilde;o, le har&aacute;n preguntas detalladas a los padres sobre la conducta y la salud del ni&ntilde;o. Preguntar&aacute; adem&aacute;s como se lleva con la familia. Es probable que los infantes, ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes sean normales plara la edad si ellos disfrutan de:

<UL>
<LI>El aprendizaje, la escuela y el trabajo.
<LI>Sus relaciones familiares.
<LI>Sus relaciones con amigos.
<LI>El juego.
</UL>

<P>Inicialmente, muchos padres comparten sus preocupaciones acerca de la normalidad (o falta de) en el desarrollo de sus hijos(a) con otros miembros de la familia, amistades, allegados, e1 m&eacute;dico de la familia, el pediatra, el consejero de la escuela, el ministro o sacerdote. En ocasiones le sugerir&aacute;n que vea un Psiquiatra de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes. Este escuchar&aacute; atentamente a los padres y al ni&ntilde;o y analizar&aacute;:

<UL>
<LI>Factores que juegan un panel importante en el desarrollo normal o de problemas del ni&ntilde;o.
<LI>Factores recientes que hayan dado inicio a problemas;
<LI>Factores que tienden a mantener los problemas;
<LI>El papel que juegan otras condiciones m&eacute;dicas; y
<LI>La combinaci&oacute;n de aprendizaje acad&eacute;mico con el crecimiento social y emocional.
</UL>

<P>Basado en esa evaluaci&oacute;n el Psiquiatra de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes puede:

<UL>
<LI>Tranquilizar a los padres, explicandole como pueden promover el desarrollo normal del ni&ntilde;o y ser m&aacute;s efectivos en la crianza.
<LI>Sugerir prvgramas o actividades educativas para el ni&ntilde;o y para los padres con miras a fomentar cl proceso de desarrollo normal del ni&ntilde;o.
<LI>Proveer o hacer arreglos para consejo terap&eacute;utico de corta duraci&oacute;n, con el prop&oacute;sito de ayudar a los padres y al ni&ntilde;o a enfrentarse a peque&ntilde;os problemas del desarrollo, situaciones cotidianas estresantes, o dificultades en el manejo de un ni&ntilde;o de temperamento dificil.
</UL>

<P>Si la evaluaci&oacute;n refleja una enfermedad o condici&oacute;n psiqui&aacute;trica, el Psiquiatra de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes recomendar&aacute; un programa apropiado para su tratamiento.
<P>Los padres, mejor que nadie, conocen a sus ni&ntilde;os y cual es su conducta normal. Si hay sospecha de un problema, deben buscar ayuda a&uacute;n cuando les haga dificil enfrentarse a la idea. El hacerlo pudiera ser muy importante para solucionarlo.
<P>Este es el primer paso para asegurarse si hay o no problemas, y si lo hubiese, tomar las medidas mas apropiadas para ayudar al ni&ntilde;o(a).

<H1>SCHIZOPHRENIA IN CHILDREN</H1>

	Schizophrenia is a medical illness that causes strange thinking, strange feelings and unusual behavior.  It is an uncommon psychiatric illness in children and is hard to recognize in its early phases.<P>

	The behavior of children and adolescents with schizophrenia may differ from that of adults with this illness.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists look for several of the following early warning signs in youngsters with schizophrenia:     
<OL>
<LI>trouble telling dreams from reality,
<LI>seeing things and hearing voices which are not real,
<LI>confused thinking,
<LI>vivid and bizarre thoughts and ideas,
<LI>extreme moodiness,
<LI>odd behavior,
<LI>ideas that people are "out to get them,"
<LI>behaving like a younger child,
<LI>severe anxiety and fearfulness,
<LI>confusing television with reality,
<LI>severe problems in making and keeping friends. 
</OL>	

The behavior of children with schizophrenia may change slowly over time.  For example, children who used to enjoy relationships with others may start to become more shy or withdrawn and seem to be in their own world.  Sometimes youngsters will begin talking about strange fears and ideas.  They may start to cling to parents or say things which do not make much sense.  These early problems may first be noticed by the child's school teachers.<P>

Schizophrenia is a serious psychiatric illness.  Early diagnosis and medical treatment are important.  Children with the problems and symptoms listed above must have a complete evaluation.  Usually these children need individual treatment plans involving other professionals.  A combination of medication and individual therapy, family therapy, and specialized programs (school, activities, etc.) is often necessary.  Psychiatric medication canbe helpful for many of the symptoms and problems identified.  These medications require careful monitoring by a child and adolescent psychiatrist.  Parents should ask their family physician or pediatrician to refer them to a child and adolescent psychiatrist who is specifically trained and skilled at evaluating, diagnosing and treating children with schizophrenia. <P>

<H1>BEDWETTING </H1>
	Most children begin to stay dry at night around three years of age.  When a child has a problem with bedwetting (enuresis) after that age, parents may become concerned.<P>
	Physicians stress that enuresis is not a disease but a symptom--and a fairly common one.  Occasional accidents may occur, particularly when the child is ill.  Here are some facts parents should know about bedwetting:
<UL>
<LI>Approximately 15 percent of children wet the bed after the age of three.
<LI>Many more boys than girls wet their beds.
<LI>Bedwetting may run in families. 
<LI>Usually bedwetting stops by puberty.
</UL>
	Persistent bedwetting beyond the age of three or four rarely signals a kidney or bladder problem.  Bedwetting may sometimes be related to a sleep disorder.  In most cases it is due to the development of the child's bladder control being slower than normal.  Bedwetting may be the result of the child's tensions and emotions that require attention. <P>

	There are a variety of emotional reasons for bedwetting.  For example, when a young child begins bedwetting after several months or years of dryness during the night, this may reflect new fears of insecurities.  This may follow an event which makes the child feel insecure--moving to a new town, the loss of a family member, or, especially, the arrival of a new baby in the home.  Sometimes bedwetting occurs after a period of dryness because the child's original toilet training was too stressful. <P>

	Parents should remember that children rarely wet on purpose, and usually feel ashamed about the incident.  Rather than make the child feel naughty or ashamed, parents need to encourage the child and show faith that he or she will soon be able to enjoy staying dry at night.  A pediatrician's advice is often very helpful. <P>

	In rare instances, the problem of bedwetting cannot be resolved by the parents, the family physician or the pediatrician.  Sometimes the child may also show symptoms of emotional problems--such as persistent sadness or irritability, or a change in eating or sleeping habits.  In these cases, parents may want to talk with a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who will evaluate physical and emotional problems that may be causing the bedwetting, and will work with the child and parents to resolve these problems. <P>

<H1>CONDUCT DISORDERS</H1> 

	"Conduct disorders" are a complicated group of behavioral and emotional problems in youngsters.  Children and adolescents with these disorders have great difficulty following rules and behaving in a socially acceptable way.  They are often viewed by other children, adults and social agencies as "bad" or delinquent, rather than mentally ill.<P>

	Their expression of anger is the major problem.  They are often aggressive, both physically and verbally, with other children and to adults.  They may lie, steal, destroy property and misbehave sexually.<P>

	Research shows that the future of these youngsters is likely to be very unhappy if they and their families do not receive early, ongoing and comprehensive treatment.  Without treatment, many youngsters with conduct disorders are unable to adapt to the demands of adulthood and continue to have problems with relationships and holding a job.  They often break laws or behave antisocially.  Many children with a conduct disorder may be diagnosed as also having a coexisting depression or an attention deficit disorder. <P>

	Many factors may lead to a child developing conduct disorders, including brain damage, child abuse, defects in growth, school failure and negative family and social experiences.  The child's "bad" behavior causes a negative reaction from others, which makes the child behave even worse. <P>

	Treatment of children with conduct disorders is difficult because the causes of the illness are complex and each youngster is unique.  Adding to the challenge of treatment are the child's uncooperative attitude, fear and distrust of adults.<P>

	A child and adolescent psychiatrist uses information from other medical specialists, and from the child, family and teachers to understand the causes of the disorder and then organize a comprehensive treatment plan.<P>

	Behavior therapy and psychotherapy are usually necessary to help the child appropriately express and control anger.  Remedial education may be needed for youngsters with learning disabilities.  Parents often need expert assistance in devising and carrying out special management and educational programs in the home and at school.  Treatment may also include medication in some youngsters, such as those with difficulty paying attention and controlling movement or those having an associated depression. <P>

	Treatment is rarely brief since establishing new attitudes and behavior patterns takes time.  However, treatment offers a good chance for considerable improvement in the present and hope for a more successful future.<P>

<H1>TEEN SUICIDE</H1>

	Suicides among young people nationwide have increased dramatically in recent years. Each year in the US., thousands of teenagers commit suicide.  Suicide is the third leading cause of death for 15 - to - 24 years old, and the sixth leading cause of death for 5 - to - 14 year old.  <P>

	Teenagers experience strong feelings of stress, confusion, self-doubt, pressure to succeed, financial uncertainty, and other fears while growing up.<P>

	For some teenagers, divorce, the formation of a new family with step-parents and step-siblings, or moving to a new community can be very unsettling and can intensify self-doubts.  In some cases, suicide appears to be a "solution."<P>

	Depression and suicidal feelings are treatable mental disorders.  The child or adolescent needs to have his or her illness recognized and diagnosed, and appropriate treatment plans developed.  When parents are in doubt whether their child has a serious problem, a psychiatric examination can be very helpful.<P>

	Many of the symptoms of suicidal feelings are similar to those of depression.  Parents should be aware of the following signs of adolescents who may try to kill themselves.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists recommend that if one or more of these signs occurs, parents need to talk to their child about their concerns and seek professional help when the concerns persist.
<UL>
<LI>Change in eating and sleeping habits.
<LI>Withdrawal from friends, and family and regular activities.
<LI>Violent actions, rebellious behavior or running away.
<LI>Drug and alcohol use.
<LI>Unusual neglect of personal appearance.
<LI>Marked personality change.
<LI>Persistent boredom, difficulty concentrating, or a decline in the quality of    schoolwork.
<LI>Frequent complaints about physical symptoms, often related to emotions, such as stomachaches, headaches, fatigue, etc.
<LI>Loss of interest in pleasurable activities.
<LI>Not tolerating praise or rewards.  A teenager who is planning to commit suicide may also:
<LI>Complain of being "rotten inside."
<LI>Give verbal hints with statements such as: "I won't be a problem for you much longer," "Nothing matters," "It's no use," "I won't see you again."
<LI>Put his or her affairs in order--for example, give away favorite possessions, clean his or her room, throw away important belongings, etc.
<LI>Become suddenly cheerful after a period of depression.
</UL>
	If a child or adolescent says, "I want to kill myself," or "I'm going to commit suicide", always take the statement seriously and seek evaluation from a child and adolescent psychiatrist or other physician.  People often feel uncomfortable talking about death. However, asking the child or adolescent whether he or she is depressed or thinking about suicide can be helpful.  Rather than "putting thoughts in the child's head," such a question will provide assurance that somebody cares and will give the young person the chance to talk about problems.<P>
	With support from family and professional treatment, children and teenagers who are suicidal can heal and return to a more healthy path of development.<P>

<hr>
<H1>SUICIDIO EN ADOLESCENTES</H1>
<P>En los Estados Unidos se ha registrado un aumento dram&aacute;tico en los suicidios de j&oacute;venes en los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os. M&aacute;s de 5,000 j&oacute;venes entre las edades de 15-24 a&ntilde;os cometieron suicidio en 1981. La cifra contin&uacute;a aumentando. Hoy d&iacute;a el suicidio es la segunda causa de muerte para j&oacute;venes entre los 10-24 a&ntilde;os.
<P>Muchos adolescentes experimentan sentimi entos intensos de tensi&oacute;n, confusi&oacute;n e indecisi&oacute;n durante el proceso de crecimiento y maduraci&oacute;n. La presi&oacute;n para obtener &eacute;xito, en combinaci&oacute;n con las incertidumbres econ&oacute;micas, as&iacute; como temor a una guerra nuclear pueden intensificar estos sentimientos.
<P>Para algunos adolescentes, el divorcio, la formaci&oacute;n de una nueva fami lia con padrastros o madrastrasy hermanastras, o mudarse a una comunidad nueva puede inestabilizarse e intensificar su sentimiento de desconfianza o dudas. En algunos casos el suicidio puede parecer una &quot;soluci&oacute;n&quot;. Sentimientos depresivos y suicidas son problemas mentales tratables. Un ni&ntilde;o o adolescente necesita que su enfermedad sea reconocida y dia gn osticada y que un plan de tratami ento adecuado sea llevado a cabo. Cuando los padres tengan dudas en cuanto a si su hijo(a) tiene o no un problema serio deben tener en cuenta que hacerle una evaluaci&oacute;n psiqui&aacute;trica no le va a perjudicar al joven.
<P>Muchos de los sfntomas de sentimientos suicidas son similares a los de depresi&oacute;n. Los padres de los adolescentes deben estar conscientes de aquellas se&ntilde;ales indicativas de intento de suicidio. Los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os recomiendan que si se observa una de las siguientes se&ntilde;ales, los padres deben hablar con su hijo(a) acerca de su preocupaci&oacute;n y buscarle ayuda profesional si la preocupaci&oacute;n persiste:
<UL>
<LI>Cambios en los patrones alimenticios o de sue&ntilde;o.
<LI>Aislamiento de sus amigos, familiares o actividades usuales.
<LI>Conducta rebelde, violenta, o huir del hogar.
<LI>Abuso de alcohol o de drogas.
<LI>Abandono de su apariencia f&iacute;sica.
<LI>Aburrimiento persistente, dificultad en concentraci&oacute;n y deterioro en la calidad del trabajo acad&eacute;mico.
<LI>Quejas ffsicas frecuentes, como dolores de est&oacute;mago de cabeza, fatiga, etc. siempre relacionado ccn los estados emocionales.
<LI>P&eacute;rdida de inter&eacute;s en actividades que son placenteras..
<LI>Intolerancia para el alabo o las recompensas.
</UL>

<P>Un adolescente que contempla la posibilidad de cometer suicidio puede tambi&eacute;n:
<UL>
<LI>Quejarse de que se siente horrible interiormente.
<LI>Hacer sugerencias con manifestaciones verbales como: &quot;no ser&eacute; un problema para tf por muaho m&aacute;s tiempo&quot;, &quot;nada importa&quot;, &quot;no te volver&eacute; a ver&quot;.
<LI>Poner sus cosas en orden, como por ejemplo, botar (tirar, desechar), regalar sus pertenencias favoritas, limpiar y arreglar su cuarto.
<LI>Volverse s&uacute;bitamente alegre o euf&oacute;rico luego de un perfodo de presi&oacute;n.
</UL>

<P>Muchas personas se sienten inc&oacute;modas hablando sobre la muerte. Sin embargo, puede ser de ayuda preguntar al ni&ntilde;o o adolescente si est&aacute; o n&oacute; deprimido o si piensa en el suicidio. En vez de &quot;estar poniendo ideas en la mente&quot; del joven con esta pregunta, lo que se logra es que la misma le d&eacute; la seguridad de que alguien se preocupa y tambi&eacute;n le dar&aacute; una oportunidad para hablar de su problema.
<P>Con el apoyo familiar, de los amigos y de tratamiento profesional, ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes suicidas pueden recuperarse y conducirse hacia un desarrollo m&aacute;s saludable.

<H1>MANIC-DEPRESSIVE ILLNESS IN TEENS</H1>
	  Teenagers with manic-depressive illness have an ongoing combination of extremely high (manic) and low (depressed) moods.  Highs may alternate with lows, or the person may feel both extremes at close to the same time.  Professionals also refer to manic-depressive illness as bipolar mood disorder.<P>

	  Manic-depressive illness usually starts in adult life, before the age of 35.  Although rare in young children, it does occur in teenagers.  This illness can affect anyone.  However, if one or both parents have manic-depressive illness, the chances are greater that their children will develop the disorder.<P>

	  Manic-depressive illness may begin either with manic or depressive symptoms.  The manic symptoms include:
<UL>
<LI> Severe changes in mood compared to others of the same age and background-- either unusually happy or silly, or very irritable.  
<LI>Unrealistic highs in self-esteem--for example, a teenager who feels specially connected to God.  
<LI>Great energy increase;  ability to go with little or no sleep for days without feeling tired.  
<LI>Increased talking--the adolescent talks too much, too fast, changes topics too quickly, and cannot be interrupted.  
<LI>Distractibility--the teen's attention moves constantly from one thing to the next.   
<LI>High risk-taking behavior, such as jumping off a roof with the belief that this will not cause injury.
</UL>

The depressive symptoms include:  
<UL>
<LI>Persistent sadness; frequent crying; depression.  
<LI>Loss of enjoyment in favorite activities.   
<LI>Frequent complaints of physical illnesses such as headaches or stomach aches.  
<LI>Low energy level, poor concentration, complaints of boredom.  
<LI>Major change in eating or sleeping patterns, such as oversleeping or overeating.
</UL>

	   Some of these signs are similar to those that occur in teenagers with other problems such as drug abuse, delinquency, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or even schizophrenia.  The diagnosis can only be made with careful observation over an extended period of time.  A thorough evaluation by a child and adolescent psychiatrist can be helpful in identifying the problems--manic-depressive or other-- and starting specific treatment.<P>

	  Teenagers with manic-depressive illness can be effectively treated.  Effective treatment for manic-depressive illness usually includes education of the patient and the family about the illness, medication such as lithium, and psychotherapy.  Lithium often reduces the number and severity of manic episodes, and also helps to prevent depression.  Psychotherapy helps the teenager understand himself or herself, adapt to stresses, rebuild self-esteem and improve relationships.<P>

<H1>THE ANXIOUS CHILD</H1>

	All children experience anxiety.  Anxiety in children is expected and       normal at specific times in development.  For example, from approximately       age 7 months through the preschool years, healthy youngsters may show       intense distress (anxiety) at times of separation from their parents or other       persons with whom they are close.  Young children may have short-lived       fears, (such as fear of the dark, storms, animals or strangers).  However,       when anxieties become severe and begin to interfere with the daily activities of childhood, such as separating from parents, attending school and making       friends, parents should consider seeking the evaluation and advice of a child       and adolescent psychiatrist.  A child or adolescent with severe separation anxiety may show some of the following:  
<UL>
<LI>constant thoughts and fears about safety of self and parents, 
<LI>refusing to go to school, 
<LI>frequent stomachaches and other physical complaints,    
<LI>extreme worries about sleeping away from home,
<LI>overly clingy behavior at home,
<LI>panic or tantrums at times of separation from parents.
</UL>

Some anxious children are afraid to meet or talk to new people.  Children with  this difficulty may have few friends outside the family.  Other children with severe anxiety may have:         
<UL>
<LI>many worries about things before they happen,         
<LI>constant worries or concern about school, friends or sports.
</UL>	

Anxious children are often overly tense or uptight.  Some may seek a lot of reassurance, and their worries may interfere with activities.  Because anxious children may also be quiet, compliant and eager to please, their difficulties may be missed.  Parents should be alert to the signs of severe anxiety so they can intervene early to prevent complications.  Early treatment can prevent future difficulties, such as, loss of friendships, failure to reach social and academic potential, and feelings of low self-esteem.  Severe anxiety problems in children can be treated.  Treatments may include a combination of the following:  individual psychotherapy, family therapy, medications, behavioral treatments, and consultation to the school.     <P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Academy Chooses Universal Access to Health Care for <BR>Children as Top Legislative Priority</B></FONT></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
As the 105th Congress begins its work, several legislators are preparing to sponsor proposals that
would extend health care coverage to the 10 million uninsured children in this country. These
legislators are not alone in expressing their concern about children and adolescents without
insurance.  <strong>The Academy's Executive Committee, anticipating the need to focus attention
on children endangered by the welfare reform law, has chosen universal access to health
care as the Academy's top legislative priority.</strong>  The Academy's leaders are asking AACAP
members to adopt this priority and be a part of a grassroots effort to contact their legislators early
in this Congressional session.

<P>
Last year, Congress approved health insurance reforms to end discriminatory practices when
employees change jobs or have pre-existing conditions.   Efforts to end discrimination against
coverage for mental illnesses were partially successful when legislators mandated equal annual and
lifetime limits where mental and physical illnesses are covered.  Legislators and the White House
appear to agree that insurance for all youngsters should be the priority health care agenda item. 
<strong>The Academy will ask that all proposals provide parity coverage for mental and physical
illnesses.</strong>

<P>
There are currently 10 million American children who do not receive health insurance coverage. 
Over 3 million are eligible for, but are not receiving Medicaid, and seven million -- the vast
majority of uninsured children -- are from families in which one or both parents work, but where
the parent's coverage may not extend to their dependents.  With the changes to SSI through the
welfare reform law, children taken off the SSI rolls will also lose their eligibility for Medicaid. 
Many of these children have serious emotional disorders.  Below, are the 1994 statistics on the
percentage of uninsured children, by state.
<BR><br wp="br2">
<CENTER><img src="/web/images/map.gif" ></CENTER><br clear=all>
Already, there are three major proposals being considered:



<ol>
  <li><strong>Senators Kennedy (D-MA) and Kerry's (D-MA) proposal</strong> - establishes a subsidy
program to help working families purchase private health insurance for their children
through a group purchasing pool or a private insurance company, both of which would
offer similar comprehensive benefits.  Only families with incomes too high to qualify for
Medicaid would be eligible. The proposal is estimated to cost $24 billion over the first five
years, with the money coming from a 75 cent increase in the cigarette tax.  A full phased-in program would cost about $9 billion a year.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li><strong>Senator Daschle (D-SD) and Representative Gephardt's (D-MO-3) proposal</strong> -
mandates that all insurers that do business with the federal government offer affordable
and accessible policies for children up to age 13.  Benefits covered would be equivalent to
those contained in current packages and consumer protections, including no discrimination
based on health status and guaranteed renewability will be mandated.  Assistance to cover
a portion of the cost of the premium will come in the form of tax relief and premium
subsidies.  The proposal has not been scored by the Congressional Budget Office, but may
weigh in at half the cost of the Kennedy/Kerry proposal.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li><strong>Representative Stark's (D-CA-13) proposal</strong> - mandates all group health plans and
insurers to make coverage available for dependents and other individuals under the age of
21.  Coverage would include all Medicare benefits, newborn and well-baby care, well-child
visits and periodic appointments to monitor the child's development.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li><strong>President Clinton is considering a proposal</strong> to extend a $750 million per year program
to cover "gap" kids, who are not eligible for Medicaid and who are without access to
private insurance.</li>
</ol>
<br wp="br2">
<P><strong><u>What's Being Done:</u></strong>
<P>
The Academy has already taken the lead on writing the "<I>Principles and Recommendations for
Legislation</I>," for the National Consortium for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. The
first of five principles is<strong> universal non-discriminatory access to health care treatment and
services.  </strong>The document was sent to all members of Congress with an endorsement from 18 of
the 23 national organizations represented in the Consortium.  If you would like to receive a copy
of the "<I>Principles and Recommendations for Legislation,</I>" please call Kristin Kroeger at 1-800-333-7636.

<P>
The Department of Government Affairs is planning these additional actions to support passage of
universal access to health care for children:

<strong><u>What can I do?</u></strong>

<P>Please write, call, fax or E-mail  your Representative and Senators and ask them to <strong>support a
children's health care initiative that provides universal access for children with
nondiscriminatory coverage for mental illnesses.</strong>  Ask him/her if they are willing to sponsor or
co-sponsor legislation to provide uninsured children access to non-discriminatory health care
coverage.  Be sure to mention the percentage of uninsured children in your state.  Below is a
sample letter and some talking points.
</strong>
<p>
<BR><strong>Sample letter</strong>:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Dear Representative/Senator:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As a constituent, and a child and adolescent psychiatrist, I urge you to support children's health
care legislation that provides universal access for children, with nondiscriminatory coverage for
mental illnesses. Today, there are 10 million American children without health insurance - in <u>(your
state name)</u> alone, <u>(? percent</u>- see chart) of children are uninsured.  Over half of these uninsured
children are from families in which one or both parents work, but where the parent's coverage
may not extend to their dependents.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The treatment of childhood disorders represents a major public health concern.  Chronic mental
illnesses respond well to treatment, but lifelong access to the health care system is necessary.
Successful diagnosis and treatment is a wise investment, given the pain, long-term disadvantages,
and financial costs associated with untreated childhood behavioral and emotional disorders.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I urge you to support the development of a bill that will provide universal nondiscriminatory
health care coverage to all children. With the changes to SSI through the welfare reform law, 
children removed from the SSI rolls may not be eligible to receive services through Medicaid. 
This will only result in an increase of uninsured children with mental illnesses.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Sincerely,<BR>
(Your name), M.D.
<P>
<BR>
<strong>Talking points:</strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
<LI>There are currently about 10 million American children who do not receive health
insurance coverage.  Over three million are eligible for, but are not receiving Medicaid,
and seven million -- the vast majority of uninsured children -- are from families in which

disorders. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Mental illnesses are treatable, and with successful diagnosis and treatment, most children
and adolescents with mental illnesses can lead productive lives.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Children are not just small adults, they need coverage tailored for their needs. For
example, children with mental illnesses seldom need hospitalization, but when they do, it is
usually for a longer period of time than allowed under current coverage.  Whereas,
physical illnesses are not limited to a specific number of inpatient days. Any universal
coverage should include the availability of an integrated system of care for children and
adolescents provides the range of services needed for an individual treatment plan, which
may include partial hospitalization, home and school based services, and therapeutic foster
care.</li>

<H1>MAKING DAY CARE A GOOD EXPERIENCE </H1>

	Most child and adolescent psychiatrists recognize that the ideal environment for raising a small child is in the home with parents and family.  Intimate daily direct parental care of infants for the first several months of life is particularly important.  Since the ideal environment often is not available, the role of day care, especially in the first few years of the child's life, needs to be considered.  Some experts recommend a minimum of six or more months leave for parents.  All agree that when day care is used, the quantity and quality of the day care are significant in the child's development. <P>

	Before choosing a day care environment, parents should be familiar with the state licensure regulations for child care.  They should also check references and observe the caregivers with the child. <P>

	Parents sometimes take their young child to the home of a person who is also caring for one or more others.  In this family-based day care, infants and children under two-and- one-half need:
<UL>
<LI>More adults per child than older children require.
<LI>A lot of individual attention.
<LI>The same caregiver(s) over a long period. 
<LI>A caregiver who will play and talk with them, smile with them, praise hem for their achievements, and enjoy them. 
</UL>
	Parents should seek a caregiver who is self-confident, affectionate and comfortable with the children.  The caregiver should be able to encourage social skills and positive behavior, and set limits on negative ones.  Parents should be sensitive to the caregiver's capacity to relate to children of different ages.  Some individuals can work well only with children at a specific stage of development. <P>

	It is wise for parents to find out how long the individual plans to work in this day care job.  High turnover of individuals, several turnovers, or any turnover at critical points of development, can distress the child.  If parents begin to think or feel the day care they have chosen is unsatisfactory, they should change caregivers. <P>

	Many children, particularly after the age of three, benefit from good group day care, where they can have fun and learn how to interact with others.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists suggest that parents seek day care services with:
<UL>
<LI>Trained, experienced teachers who enjoy, understand and can lead children.
<LI>The same day care staff for a long period of time.
<LI>Opportunity for creative work, imaginative play and physical activity.
<LI>Space to move indoors and out.
<LI>Enough teachers and assistants--ideally, at least one for every five (or fewer) children.
<LI>Lots of drawing and coloring materials and toys, as well as equipment such as swings, wagons, jungle gyms, etc.
<LI>Small rather than large groups if possible.  (Studies have shown that five children with one caregiver is better than 20 children with four caregivers.) 
</UL>
	If the child seems afraid to go to day care, parents should introduce the new environment gradually:  at first, the mother or father can go along, staying nearby while the child plays.  The parent and child can stay for a longer period each day until the child wants to become part of the group.<P>

	Though parents may worry about how the child will do, they should show pleasure in helping their child succeed.  If the child shows unusual or persistent terror about leaving home, parents should discuss it with their pediatrician. <P>

<H1>COMO HACER DEL CUIDADO DIURNO UNA GRAN EXPERIENCIA</H1>

<P>
Los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes han encontrado que el cuidado diurno de por s&iacute; no produce efectos positivos ni negativos en el bienestar emocional de un ni&ntilde;o. Lo que es significativo en el desarrollo emocional del ni&ntilde;o es la calidad del cuidado que se reciba.
<P>Antes de escoger un centro de cuidado diurno o guarder&iacute;a, los padres deben averiguar sobre las reglamentaciones estatales que regulan el cuidado diurno. Deben de buscar referencias y observar, cuando sea posible, a las personas encargadas del cuidado de sus hijos.
<P>En ocasiones los padres llevan a cuidar a su peque&ntilde;o al hogar de alguna persona que atiende a uno o m&aacute;s ni&ntilde;os. En este tipo de hogar familiar los ni&ntilde;os de dos a&ntilde;os o menos, quienes necesitan mayor atenci&oacute;n individual, se benefician de una persona que les pueda hablar, sonreir, jugar con ellos, aplaudir sus logros y disfrutar de su relaci&oacute;n.
<P>Los padres deben buscar una persona en la que se tenga confianza, que sea afectuosa y que se sienta c&oacute;moda con ni&ntilde;os. Esta persona debe estimular el desarrollo de habilidades sociales y de conductas positivas as&iacute; como saber poner l&iacute;mites y controles a las conductas negativas. Los padres deben de conocer la capacidad de esta persona para relacionarse con ni&ntilde;os de diferentes edades. Algunas personas s&oacute;lo pueden ser afectivas con ni&ntilde;os de cierto nivel de desarrollo y no con otro.
<P>Es importante que los padres averiguen cu&aacute;nto tiempo la persona estar&aacute; disponible para ese trarabajo. Los cambios s&uacute;bitos o en ciertas etapas cr&iacute;ticas del desarrollo pueden producir mucha incomodidad en el ni&ntilde;o. Sin embargo, si los padres se dar. cuenta que el ambiente de cuidado que han escogido para su hijo, no es satisfactorio, deben cambiarlo por un ambiente m&aacute;s apropiado, tan pronto sea posible.
<P>Los ni&ntilde;os mayores de tres a&ntilde;os de edad se benefician de centros de cuidado diurno en los que hay un grupo de ni&ntilde;os. As&iacute; ellos pueden disfrutar m&aacute;s y aprender a interactuar mejor. Los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes sugieren a los padres que busquen:

<UL>
<LI>Maestros adiestrados con experiencia, que disfruten, comprendan y puedan ser buenos gu&iacute;as para los ni&ntilde;os.
<LI>Que se provea oportunidad amplia para el trabajo creativo y el juego imaginativo del ni&ntilde;o.
<LI>Lugar espacioso, tanto interior como exteriormente.
<LI>Suficiente material para dibujar, colorear; juguetes y equipo de juego como columpios, carretas, juegos de gimnasia, etc.
<LI>Los grupos deben ser peque&ntilde;os Dos estudios demuestran que un grupo de 10 ni&ntilde;os cuidados por dos personas funciona mejor que uno de 20 atendido por cuatro personas).
</UL>

<P>Si los ni&ntilde;os se muestran temerosos, sus padres deben introducirlos al nuevo ambiente gradualmente. Al principio el padre o la madre puede acompa&ntilde;ar al ni&ntilde;o y quedarse un rato mientras el ni&ntilde;o comienza a jugar. Los padres pueden permanecer con el ni&ntilde;o por per&iacute;odos de tiempo m&aacute;s largos durante unos d&iacute;as hasta que el ni&ntilde;o comience a formar parte del grupo.
<P>Aunque a los padres le preocupa c&oacute;mo le ir&aacute; al ni&ntilde;o(a), deben de animarlo y ayudarlo a disfrutar de su progreso y adaptaci&oacute;n. Cuando los ni&ntilde;os tienen temores persistentes al dejar los padres, deben de pedir al pediatra o el medico de familia que les refiera a un Psiquiatra de Nines y Adolescentes, que es un medico con cinco a&ntilde;os de adiestramiento especializado en el campo de la conducta humana. Este evaluar&aacute; la situaci&oacute;n y le dar&aacute; recomendaciones para su manejo.

 No. 15 (10/92)
<H1>THE ADOPTED CHILD</H1> 

	Parents with an adopted child wonder whether, when and how to tell their child that he or she is adopted.  They also want to know if there are special problems for an adopted child. <P>

	Child and adolescent psychiatrists recommend that the child be told about the adoption by the adoptive parents.  Children should be told about their adoption in a way that they can understand. <P>

	There are two different views on when a child should be told about the adoption.  Many experts believe the child should be told at the earliest age possible.  This approach provides the child an early opportunity to accept and integrate the concept of being "adopted."  Other experts believe that telling a child too early may confuse the young child who can't really understand the event.  These experts advise waiting until the child is older. <P>

	In either case, children should learn of their adoption from the adoptive parents.  This helps give the message that adoption is good and that the child can trust the parents.  If the child first learns about the adoption intentionally or accidentally from someone other than parents, the child may feel anger and mistrust towards the parents, and may view the adoption as bad or shameful because it was kept a secret. <P>

	Adopted children will want to talk about their adoption and parents should encourage this process. Several excellent children's story books are available in bookstores which help parents tell the child about being adopted.<P>

	Children have a variety of responses to the knowledge that they are adopted.  Their feelings and responses depend on their age and level of maturity.  The child may deny the adoption or create fantasies about it.  Frequently, adopted children hold onto beliefs that they were given away for being bad or may believe that they were kidnapped.  If the parents talk openly about the adoption and present it in a positive manner, these worries are less likely to develop.<P>

	All adolescents go through a stage of struggling with their identity--wondering how they fit with their family, their peers, and the rest of the world.  The adopted adolescent is likely to have an increased interest in his or her birth parents during this stage.  This open curiosity is not unusual and does not mean that he or she is rejecting the adoptive parents.  Some adolescents may wish to learn the identity of their birth parents.  Adoptive parents can respond by letting the adolescent know it is okay to have this wish.  The adolescent who asks should usually be given, with tact and supportive discussion, information about the birth family.<P>

	The adoptive child may develop emotional or behavioral problems.  The problems may or may not result from insecurities or issues related to being adopted.  If parents are concerned they should seek professional assistance.  A child and adolescent psychiatrist can help the child and adoptive parents determine whether or not help is needed. <P>

<center><H3>President Announces His FY 1998 Budget<BR>SSA Announces New SSI Regulations</H3></center>
<P><BR>
Last week, the President unveiled his five-year spending plan that includes increases in NIH, Medicare, Medicaid, juvenile justice and education programs, <B>and a new children's health initiative</B>.  This is the first step of a six-month process to determine federal spending for fiscal year 1998 and beyond.  The overall goal of his spending plan is to balance the budget in five years, something that has not been done since 1969.  With increases in education and juvenile justice programs, and the new children's health initiative, the President's recommendations attempt to counter some of the negative aspects of the welfare reform.  Congress has indicated it will seriously consider the budget rather than draft separate proposals.
<P>
<B>Children's Health Initiative</B>  The budget proposes a five-year $18.4 billion children's health initiative that would expand health care coverage to 5 million of the 10 million uninsured children.  <BR>
The initiative would:
<ul>
<li>Give annual grants to states to cover health insurance premiums, for up to six months, for children who are at risk because their parents change jobs.  

<li>Provide states with $3.8 billion over the next five years to develop innovative approaches to help working families who earn too much for Medicaid but too little to afford private coverage buy.

<li>Allow states to extend Medicaid coverage for one year to eligible children with parents who are changing jobs, moving from welfare to work, or remarrying.
</ul>
The Department of Health and Human Services, if approved would work states, advocacy groups, providers, and businesses to identify and enroll the 3 million children who are eligible but not enrolled in Medicaid.
<P>
<B>Medicare & Medicaid</B>  The budget proposes an 8 percent increase in Medicare and 7.4 percent increase in Medicaid.  Medicare's annual inflation increases for hospitals would be reduced, and graduate medical education payments would be adjusted.  A per-capita cap is proposed on Medicaid grants to states to save $9 billion over the next five years.  Because of the cap, states will receive more flexibility in managing their Medicaid programs, such as allowing states to mandate enrollment in managed care plans without going through the Federal waiver process, eliminating Federal provider payment requirements for hospitals and nursing homes, and allowing states to provide continuous coverage to children for one year after eligibility.
<P>
<B>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</B>  The President's 1998 request for NIH is $13.1 billion, an increase of 2.6% over the FY 1997 level.  The National Institute for Mental Health is recommended to receive an increase of $26 million, from $604 million in FY 1997 to $630 million.  The National Institute for Drug Abuse recommendation doubled, receiving the biggest increase based on a $30 million recommendation jump over FY 1997 levels.  This 9% increase reflects the Administration's plan for a coordinated approach to combating drug abuse.  The National Institute on Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse would receive an increase of $7 million in the President's budget.
<P>
<B>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)</B>  The President's FY 1998 level for SAMHSA totals $2.2 billion, with a very modest increase of $35 million or 1.5 percent over the FY 1997. Most Center for Mental Health Programs (CMHS) are maintained at their FY 1997 levels.  This includes the $275 million for the Mental Health Block Grant and $70 million for the Children's Mental Health Services Program. Due to the large number of persons now covered in managed mental health plans, the President has requested $445 million to support the Federal government's roles in the mental health services field.    An additional $10 million was requested for the Substance Abuse Performance Partnership Block Grant.
<P>
<B>Education</B>  In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton deemed education the top priority of his second term.  In his FY 1998 budget, spending for education will increase 13 percent.  This will cut across every major program the department manages. Special education programs would receive an increase of $173 million or 4.3 percent over FY 1997 levels.
<P>
<B>Juvenile Justice</B>  The proposed Justice Department's budget would increase nearly 5 percent.  This includes $233 million in spending to combat violent crime by gang members and other young criminals, with about half the money designated for a grant program that would provide funding, training, and equipment for local prosecutors who specialize in this area.  If the President's budget is accepted, this will mark a 70 percent rise in the Justice Department's budget since he took office.
<P><BR>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>New SSI Regulations Released</FONT></CENTER>
<BR>
In February, the Social Security Administration finally released new regulations for the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.  The regulations were required by the welfare reform law passed by Congress last August.  As expected a large number of children will be removed from the rolls.  Of the children being reviewed, SSA estimates that 135,000 will lose their eligibility.  Key aspects of the new regulations are:
<ul>
<li> A new definition of childhood disability.  Children must have a "medically determinable physical or mental impairment which results in marked and severe functional limitations" of substantial duration to qualify for disability benefits.
<P>
<li>Elimination of the Individualized Functional Assessment (IFA) which determined eligibility by comparing a child's limitations in various daily activities to the activities of children the same age who do not have a disability.  Children will now qualify through the more restrictive medical listings.
<P>
<li>The medical listings will be modified to eliminate references to "maladaptive behavior" for children with mental impairments. Previously maladaptive behavior was counted in two domains: social and personal/behavioral functioning.  The new regulations instruct disability examiners to only consider evidence of this limitation when evaluating a child's social functioning.  
<P>
<li>Current recipients will continue to receive benefits until July 1, 1997, or the date of redetermination, if it is later.
<P>
<li>State medical assistance agencies have been instructed to continue Medicaid while SSA reviews a child's SSI eligibility and throughout the appeal process if a child challenges the denial of SSI benefits.  The President's budget proposes that Congress allocate funds to continue Medicaid to children who lose their SSI benefits due to the program changes.
<P>
<li>Every three years, children will have their cases reviewed unless their condition is not expected to improve.
</ul>

<P><BR>
As the 105th Congress begins its work, several legislators are preparing to sponsor proposals that would extend health care coverage to the 10 million uninsured children in this country. These legislators are not alone in expressing their concern about children and adolescents without insurance.  <B>The Academy's Executive Committee, anticipating the need to focus attention on children endangered by the welfare reform law, has chosen universal access to health care as the Academy's top legislative priority. </B> The Academy's leaders are asking AACAP members to adopt this priority and be a part of a grassroots effort to contact their legislators early in this Congressional session. 
<P>
Last year, Congress approved health insurance reforms to end discriminatory practices when employees change jobs or have pre-existing conditions.   Efforts to end discrimination against coverage for mental illnesses were partially successful when legislators mandated equal annual and lifetime limits where mental and physical illnesses are covered.  Legislators and the White House appear to agree that insurance for all youngsters should be the priority health care agenda item.  <B>The Academy will ask that all proposals provide parity coverage for mental and physical illnesses.</B>

<B>Sample letter:</B><BR>
Dear Representative/Senator:
<P>
As a constituent, and a child and adolescent psychiatrist, I urge you to support children's health care legislation that provides universal access for children, with nondiscriminatory coverage for mental illnesses. Today, there are 10 million American children without health insurance of children are uninsured.  Over half of these uninsured children are from families in which one or both parents work, but where the parent's coverage may not extend to their dependents.  
<P>
The treatment of childhood disorders represents a major public health concern.  Chronic mental illnesses respond well to treatment, but lifelong access to the health care system is necessary. Successful diagnosis and treatment is a wise investment, given the pain, long-term disadvantages, and financial costs associated with untreated childhood behavioral and emotional disorders.  I urge you to support the development of a bill that will provide universal nondiscriminatory health care coverage to all children.
<P>
Sincerely,
(Your name), M.D.
<P><BR>
<B>Talking points:</B>
<ul>
<li>There are currently about 10 million American children who do not receive health insurance coverage.  Over three million are eligible for, but are not receiving Medicaid, and seven million -- the vast majority of uninsured children -- are from families in which one or both parents work, but where the parent's coverage may not extend to their dependents. 
<P>
<li>Mental illnesses are treatable, and with successful diagnosis and treatment, most children and adolescents with mental illnesses can lead productive lives.
<P>
<li>Children are not just small adults, they need coverage tailored for their needs. For example, children with mental illnesses seldom need hospitalization, but when they do, it is usually for a longer period of time than allowed under current coverage.  Whereas, physical illnesses are not limited to a specific number of inpatient days. Any universal coverage should include the availability of an integrated system of care for children and adolescents provides the range of services needed for an individual treatment plan, which may include partial hospitalization, home and school based services, and therapeutic foster care.
</ul>

<FONT SIZE=+1>State Parity Activity</FONT> - Parity legislation at the state level will be on many legislators' agendas this year.  Several statehouses are already considering bills.  Parity legislation is expected in VT, PA, OH, ND, TX, CO, FL, KS, and UT.  Legislative language in these proposals often provides parity to specific mental illnesses; this may not always include the major disorders in children and adolescents.  If you reside in one of these states, it is very important that you contact your state legislators and urge them to include all childhood psychiatric disorders in the parity proposal.  If your state is considering parity legislation, please contact the Academy's Department of Government Affairs.

No. 19 (10/92)
<H1>THE CHILD WITH A LONG-TERM ILLNESS </H1>
	The child with a serious medical illness is at risk for developing associated psychological problems.  Unlike a child with a temporary sickness such as the flu, the child with a chronic illness must cope with knowing that the disease is here to stay and may even get worse.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists point out that almost all these children at first refuse to believe they are ill, and later feel guilt and anger. <P>

	The young child, unable to understand why the sickness has occurred, may assume it is a punishment for being "bad."  He or she may become angry with parents and doctors for not being able to cure the illness.  The youngster may react strongly against pampering, teasing, or other attention.  Uncomfortable treatments, and restrictions in diet and activity may make the child bitter and withdrawn. <P>

	A teenager with a long-term illness may feel pulled in opposite directions.  On the one hand, he or she must take care of the physical problem, requiring dependence on parents and doctors.  On the other hand, the adolescent wants to become independent and join his or her friends in various activities.  When a teenager with a long-term illness tries to decrease or stop taking the prescribed medication without consulting with the physician, this often shows a normal adolescent desire to take charge of one's own body. <P>

	Chronic illness may cause setbacks in school or avoidance of school.  This can increase the child's loneliness and feeling of being different from or behind other youngsters.  Parents who want to help their child in every way possible should respond not only to the child's illness, but also to his or her strengths.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists know that if overprotected, the boy or girl may not learn to socialize or may have difficulty separating from parents when it is time to be involved in school.  It is often helpful for the child to be in contact with others who have successfully adjusted to living with a chronic illness. <P>

	In their prolonged periods of hospitalization and/or rest at home, children may develop excellence in a hobby or special talent such as art, model airplanes or a foreign language.  They may also learn as much as about their illness as possible.  Such activities are psychologically healthy and should be encouraged. <P>

	Children with long-term illnesses are often treated by a team of medical specialists which may usefully include a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who can help the child and family develop psychologically healthy ways of living with the disease and its effects. <P>

<H1>CHILDREN & DIVORCE</H1>

	Frequently parents who are getting a divorce are worried about the effect on their children.  These parents may be preoccupied with their own problems but still realize that they are the most important people in their children's lives.<P>
	While parents may be devastated or relieved by the divorce, children are invariably frightened and confused by the threat to their security.  Some parents feel so hurt or overwhelmed by the divorce that they may turn to the child for comfort or direction. Divorce can be misinterpreted by children unless parents tell them what is happening, how they are involved and not involved and what will happen to them.<P>
	Children often believe they have caused the conflict between their mother and father. Many children assume the responsibility for bringing their parents back together, sometimes by sacrificing themselves.  Vulnerability to both physical and mental illnesses can originate in the traumatic loss of one or both parents through divorce.  With care and attention, however, a family's strengths can be mobilized during a divorce, and children can be helped to deal constructively with the resolution of parental conflict.<P>
	Parents should be aware if there are signs of persistent stress in their child or children.  These may include loss of motivation for school, or for making friends or even for having fun.  Other warning signs include sleeping too much or too little, or being unusually rebellious and argumentative within the family.<P>
	Children need to know that their mother and father will still be their parents even though the marriage is ending and the parents won't live together.  Long custody disputes or pressure on a child to "choose sides" can be particularly harmful for the youngster and can add to the damage of the divorce.<P>
	Parents' ongoing commitment to the child's well-being is vital.  If a child shows signs of stress, the family doctor or pediatrician can refer the parents to a child and adolescent psychiatrist.  He or she can evaluate and treat the symptoms caused by stress.  In addition, the child and adolescent psychiatrist can meet with the parents to help them learn how to make the strain of the divorce easier on the entire family.<P>

<p><strong>Welfare Reform update</strong>
<p>
<p>The new welfare reform law changes children's eligibility for Supplemental Security Income
(SSI). As a result of these changes, some children with mental illnesses could lose there SSI
benefits they now receive.  The most important provision for child and adolescent psychiatrists to
understand, involves the <u>automatic review</u> of all beneficiaries added to the rolls through an
individual functional assessment (IFA).  <u>IFA's will no longer be part of the eligibility criteria.</u> 
These children will now have to qualify through the Social Security Administration's new
definition of disability for children and meet the new eligibility standards.  Children with mental
illnesses are likely to have their cases reviewed because many children became eligible through the
IFA. 

<BR><br wp="br2">
<p>The new law does not stop benefits immediately, and not every child who receives SSI is under
review.  The Social Security Administration will notify each family by January 1, 1997, if their
child's case will be reviewed under the new welfare law.

<BR><br wp="br2">
<p>Changes to the SSI program:

<BR><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>The Social Security Administration will use a new definition of disability for children.  A
child must have a "medically determinable physical or mental impairment which results in
marked and severe functional limitations."</li>

<BR><br wp="br2">  <li>The "individualized functional assessment" (IFA) will no longer be used in determining
eligibility.  This assessment helped examiners compare a child's ability to function on a
daily basis with children their own age. The IFA was developed following a Supreme
Court decision on discriminatory eligibility for adults and children.</li>

<BR><br wp="br2">  <li>The Social Security Administration will change the way it considers certain behavior
problems caused by a child's mental or emotional condition. New eligibility standards are
currently being negotiated between the White House and the Social Security
Administration.</li>

<BR><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p>Although about 285,000 families of children with severe disabilities will receive notices of review,
the White House has been unable to determine the new eligibility standards.  Across the country,
editorials have urged President Clinton to be compassionate in setting the new eligibility
standards.  Other articles have focused on the plight of families of children with severe disabilities
who are likely to lose their benefits under any proposal the White House designs. This pressure
has made the decision even more difficult for President Clinton.  The President is expected to
make a personal decision on this issue in the near future.  Since, President Clinton is likely to be
personally involved in the rule-making process, continued pressure from the grassroots is
especially critical now.

<BR><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>What can you do?</u></strong>

<BR><br wp="br2">
<p>1. Call President Clinton, 202-456-1111 (email: president@whitehouse.gov); Carol Rasco,
Director of the Domestic Policy Council, 202-456-2216; and Frank Raines, Director of the Office
of Management and Budget, 202-395-4840 with this message:

<BR><br wp="br2">
<BLOCKQUOTE><strong>"The new standards for SSI eligibility must not hurt families of children with mental
illnesses; the power to hurt these children and their families, or to assist them is in
President Clinton's hands."</strong>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<p>2.  Watch for the President's decision on the new standards for SSI eligibility.

<BR>
<BR><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>Other Legislative Issues for the beginning of the 105th Congress</strong>

<BR><br wp="br2">
<p>The Office of Government Affairs is gearing-up for new legislation in the 105th Congress that will
affect children and adolescents with mental illnesses.  Universal health care access for children
with mental illnesses will lead our legislative agenda. We will also continue to keep you updated
on any legislation regarding gag clauses and funds for graduate medical education.  The Academy
will continue to monitor the reauthorizations of the Individuals with Disabilities Act and the
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act.  Both bills are likely to be at the top of each
authorizing committee's agenda.

No. 37 (10/92)  
<H1>CHILDREN AND FIREARMS</H1> 

	Parents, professionals and many others are concerned about the increasing numbers of children and adolescents killed by firearms:
<UL>
<LI>Every day, 10 American children ages 18 and under are killed in handgun suicide,homicides and accidents.  Many more are wounded.  
<LI>Gunshot wounds to children ages 16 and under have increased 300 percent in majorurban areas since 1986.  
<LI>60 percent of teen deaths by suicide involve the use of a gun.  Nearly 3,000 teensuse handguns to commit suicide every year.   
<LI>An estimated 400,000 youngsters carried handguns to school in 1987.  In Baltimore,half the males reported having taken a gun to high school.  
<LI>At least 25 million American households keep handguns and 50% of owners keep them loaded. 
</UL>

	We cannot gun-proof our children and adolescents. Children are playful and active.  Adolescents are curious and impulsive.  Such healthy traits when mixed with guns can cause death. <P>

	The best way to protect children against gun violence is to remove all guns from the home.  If parents feel they must have one or more guns in the home, there will always be some dangers.  The following actions are crucial to lessen the dangers: 
<UL>
<LI>Store all firearms unloaded and uncocked in a securely locked container.  Only the parents should know where the container is located.  
<LI>Store the guns and ammunition in separate locked locations.   
<LI>For a revolver, place a padlock around the top strap of the weapon to prevent thecylinder from closing, or use a trigger lock;  for a pistol, use a trigger lock.   
<LI>When handling or cleaning a gun, never leave it unattended, even for a moment; it should be in your view at all times.
</UL>

	Even if parents don't own a gun, they should check with parents at other places where their children play, to make sure safety precautions are followed.  In a study of accidental handgun shootings of children under 16, nearly 40% of the shootings occurred in the homes of friends and relatives.  The tragedies occurred most often when children were left unsupervised. <P>

	When youngsters use alcohol and also have a gun available, the risk for violence rapidly increases.  In a youth suicide study, victims who used firearms were about five times more likely to have been drinking than those who used other means.  In a study of firearm- associated murders among family members, almost 90% of the offenders and victims had used alcohol or drugs before the killings. <P>

	The average American child witnesses 45 acts of violence on TV each day, most involving handguns.  Children often imitate what they see, and are more aggressive after extensive viewing of TV violence.  Parents should help protect their children from the effects of watching TV violence.  For example, they can watch with children; ration TV; and disapprove of the violent episodes in front of the children, stressing the belief that such behavior is not the best way to resolve a problem.<P>

	Children and adolescents with emotional or behavioral problems may be more likely than other children to use guns, against themselves or others.  Parents who are concerned that their child is too aggressive or might have an emotional disorder may wish to seek an evaluation by a child and adolescent psychiatrist.<P>

	More information about gun safety issues and guidelines is available from the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, 1225 "I" Street, N.W., Suite 1100, Washington, D.C. 20005. <P>

<H1>CHILDREN WHO WON'T GO TO SCHOOL</H1>
	Going to school usually is an exciting, enjoyable event for young children.  For some it brings fear or panic.  Parents have cause for concern when their child regularly feels sick from tension, "plays sick" or with minor physical complaints wishes to stay home from school.  Often the child five to ten years of age who behaves this way is suffering from a paralyzing fear of leaving the safety of parents and home.  The child's panic is very difficult for parents to cope with, but these fears can be treated successfully, with professional help.<P>

	The first appearance of unreasonable fear of school is typically in nursery school, kindergarten or first grade, and it peaks in second grade.  The child may complain of a headache, sore throat, or stomach-ache shortly before it is time to leave for school.  The "illness"  subsides after the child is allowed to stay home, only to reappear the next morning before school.  In some cases the child may simply refuse to leave the house.<P>

	Refusal to go to school often begins following a period at home which the child has become closer to the mother, such as a summer vacation, a holiday break or a brief illness.  It also may follow a stressful occurrence, such as the death of a pet or relative, a change in schools or a move to a new neighborhood.<P>

	Children with an unreasonable fear of school may feel unsafe staying in a room by themselves and may display clinging behavior, shadowing the mother or father around the house. Such fears are common among children with separation Anxiety Disorder.  They often have difficulty going to sleep, and they may show exaggerated, unrealistic fears of animals, monsters, burglars or being alone in the dark.<P>

	The potential long-term effects are serious for a child who has persistent fears and does not receive professional assistance.  The child may develop serious educational or social problems if away from school and friends for an extended period.<P>

	The parents and child can benefit from seeing a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who will work with them in an effort immediately to return the child to school and other important daily activities.  Since the panic comes from leaving home rather than being in school, frequently the child is calm once in school.<P>

	For some children, the more fundamental causes of fears will need to be treated at greater length.  Refusal to go to school in the older child or adolescent is generally a more serious illness, and often requires more intensive treatment.<P>

	In any case, unreasonable fears about leaving the home and parents can be successfully treated, and parents should not hesitate to seek professional help.  The child's physician can refer the parents to a child and adolescent psychiatrist.<P>

<H1>THE DEPRESSED CHILD</H1>

	Not only adults become depressed.  Children and teenagers also may have depression. Depression is defined as an illness when it persists.<P>
	Significant depression probably exists in about 5 percent of children and adolescents in the general population.  Children under stress, who experience loss, or who have attentional, learning or conduct disorders are at a higher risk for depression.<P>
	The behavior of depressed children and teenagers differs from the behavior of depressed adults.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists advise parents to be aware of signs in their youngsters such as:
<UL>
<LI>Persistent sadness
<LI>An inability to enjoy previously favorite activities;
<LI>Increased activity or irritability;
<LI>Frequent complaints of physical illnesses such as headaches and stomachaches;
<LI>Frequent absences from school or poor performance in school;
<LI>Persistent boredom, low energy, poor concentration; or
<LI>A major change in eating and/or sleeping patterns.
</UL>
	A child who used to play often with friends may now spend most of the time alone and without interests.  Things that were once fun now bring little joy to the depressed child. Children and adolescents who are depressed may say they want to be dead or may talk about suicide.  Depressed adolescents may abuse alcohol or other drugs as a way to feel better.<P>
	Children and adolescents who cause trouble at home or at school may actually be depressed but not know it.  Because the youngster may not always seem sad, parents and teachers may not realize that troublesome behavior is a sign of depression.  When asked directly, these children can sometimes state they are unhappy or sad.<P>
	Early diagnosis and medical treatment are essential for depressed children.  For help, parents should ask their physician to refer them to a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who can diagnose and treat depression in children and teenagers.<P>

<H1>CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE</H1>

	Child sexual abuse has been reported up to 80,000 times a year, but the number of unreported instances is far greater, because the children are afraid to tell anyone what has happened, and the legal procedure for validating an episode is difficult.  The problem should be identified, the abuse stopped, and the child should receive professional help.  The long-term emotional and psychological damage can be devastating.<P>

	Child sexual abuse can take place within the family, by a parent, step-parent, sibling or other relative; or outside the home, for example, by a friend, neighbor, child care person, teacher or random molester.  However, when the sexual abuse has occurred, the child develops a variety of distressing feelings and thoughts.<P>

	No child is psychologically prepared to cope with repeated sexual stimulation.  Even a two or three year old, who cannot know the sexual activity is "wrong," will develop problems resulting from the inability to cope with the over stimulation.<P>

	The child of five or older who knows and cares for the abuser becomes trapped between affection or loyalty for the person, and the sense that the sexual activities are terribly wrong.  If the child tries to break away from the sexual relationship, the abuser may threaten the child with violence or loss of love.  When sexual abuse occurs within the family, the child may fear the anger, jealousy or shame of other family members, or be afraid the family will break up if the secret is told.<P>

	A child who is the victim of prolonged sexual abuse usually develops low self-esteem, a feeling of worthlessness and an abnormal perspective on sexuality.  The child may become withdrawn and mistrustful of adults, and can become suicidal.<P>

	Some children who have been sexually abused have difficulty relating  to others except on sexual terms.  Some sexually abused children become child abusers or prostitutes, or have other serious problems when they reach adulthood.<P>

	Often there are no physical signs of child abuse, or signs that only a physician can detect, such as changes in the genital or anal area.<P>

	The behavior of sexually abused children may include:

<UL>
<LI>Unusual interest in or avoidance of all things of a sexual nature.
<LI>Sleep problems, nightmares.
<LI>Depression or withdrawal from friends or family.
<LI>Seductiveness.
<LI>Statements that their bodies are dirty or damaged, or fear that there is something wrong with them in the genital area.
<LI>Refusal to go to school, delinquency.
<LI>Secretiveness.
<LI>Aspects of sexual molestation in drawings, games, fantasies.
<LI>Unusual aggressiveness.
<LI>Suicidal behavior.
<LI>Other severe behavior changes.
</UL>
	Child sexual abusers can make the child extremely fearful of telling, and only when a special effort has helped the child to feel safe, can the child talk freely.<P>
	
	If a child says that he or she has been molested, parents should stress that what happened was not the fault of the child.  Parents should seek a medical examination and psychiatric consultation.<P>

	These are some preventive measures that parents can take:
<UL>
<LI>Tell children that "if someone tries to touch your body and do things that make you feel 	funny, say NO to that person and tell me right away."
<LI>Teach children that respect does not mean blind obedience to adults and to authority--for example, don't tell children to "Always do everything the teacher or baby-sitter tells you to do."
<LI>Encourage professional prevention programs in the local school system.
</UL>	Professional evaluation and treatment as soon as possible for the sexually abused child and the family is the best way to overcome the risk that the child will develop serious problems as an adult.  The child and adolescent psychiatrist helps the child regain a sense of self-esteem and relieve feelings of guilt about the abuse; helps family members understand how to assist the child in overcoming the trauma; and, if the abuser is a member of the family, works to restore him or her to a healthy role in the family.<P>

<H1>CONOZCA LOS BENEFICIOS DE SU SEGURO MEDICO</H1>
<P>La mayor&iacute;a de las personas no creen que tendr&aacute;n necesidad de usar su seguro m&eacute;dico para tratamiento psiqui&aacute;trico. Cuando escoja su plan m&eacute;dico, sea este un plan tradicional, un HMO o cualquier otro plan prepagado, estudie la p&oacute;liza para asegurarse de que tiene la protecci&oacute;n adecuada. La mayoria de las personas piensan que no tendr&aacute;n que hacer uso de un plan para cubrir tratamiento psiqui&aacute;trico, pero como sabemos puede suceder en cualquier ocasi&oacute;n.
<P>La mayor parte de los planes m&eacute;dicos imponen limites importantes a los beneficios que pagan por tratamiento psiqui&aacute;trico. Los l&iacute;mites m&aacute;s altos se obtienen para las enfermedades quir&uacute;rgicas y m&eacute;dicas. Rara vez estos se aplican a las enfermedades psiqui&aacute;tricas. Los beneficios para condiciones psiqui&aacute;tricas se limitan de varias formas: en el n&uacute;mero de visitas, en la cantidad de d&oacute;lares a pagar por vida, la cantidad a pagar por a&ntilde;o, o en el n&uacute;mero de d&iacute;as de hospitalizaci&oacute;n.
<P>Estos l&iacute;mites pueden causar serias dificultades econ&oacute;micas a muchos padres consternados ya por la presencia de una enfermedad mental en la familia y por el costo del tratamiento. El costo promedio de tratamiento en un hospital privado para un ni&ntilde;o o adolescente es de aproximadamente $17,000.y la estad&iacute;a promedio de 50 d&iacute;as. Muchas compa&ntilde;&iacute;as de seguros limitan los beneficios psiqui&aacute;tricos a $15,000.a pagarse por vida.
<P>Las alternativas al tratamiento privado no son adecuadas. Sin un plan m&eacute;dico ni recursos econ&oacute;micos, la mayor parte de las personas se ven forzadas a recurrir a programas p&uacute;blicos tales como los Programas de Salud Mental Estatal o Comunitarios, u Hospitales Estatales de PsiquiatrSa. Estos son financiados nor fondos p&uacute;blicos limitados y por lo general tienen serias y cr&oacute;nicas dificultades econ&oacute;micas. Los recursos profesionales son escasos, hay una gran demanda por el servicio y largas listas de espera.
<P>Los nuevos planes m&eacute;dicos tambi&eacute;n imponen l&iacute;mites al tratamiento Psiqui&aacute;trico. La &quot;Health Maintenance Organization (HMO'S), Preferred Privider Ortanization (PPO'S) y &quot;ComUrehensive Health Plans (CHP'S)&quot; son planes prepagados que est&aacute;n dise&ntilde;ados para abaratar los costos del cuidado m&eacute;dico.
<P>Una de las &aacute;reas que estos planes limitan significativamente es la atenci&oacute;n psiqui&aacute;trica. Generalmente se limitan a cubrir la que por ley le exije el estado.
<P>Haga las siguientes preguntas a su agente de seguros antes de seleccionar su plan o seguro m&eacute;dico.


<OL>
<LI>&#191;Tienen las condiciones psiqui&aacute;tricas los mismos beneficios que otras enfermedades fisicas?
<LI>&#191;Qu&eacute; se debe hacer si un miembro de la familia cubierto por la p&oacute;liza necesita tratamiento m&aacute;s all&aacute; del l&iacute;mite estipulado por el plan?
<LI>&#191;Incluye la p&oacute;liza el pago por servicios a profesionales de la Salud Mental como Psiquiatra de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes, enfermeras siqui&aacute;tricas, y a otros, para el asegurado y su familia? &#191;Qui&eacute;n decide que profesional evaluar&aacute; y tratar&aacute; a su hijo(a2?
<LI>&#191;Cubre el plan servicios de hospitalizaci&oacute;n diurna o parcial, tratamiento residencial, ambulatorio, y/o en oficina?
<LI>&#191;Le negar&aacute;n, limitar&aacute;n o cancelar&aacute;n los servicios a la familia debido a la naturaleza de ciertas condiciones psiqui&aacute;tricas?
<LI>&#191;Qu&eacute; alternativas tengo si no estoy satisfecho con la evaluaci&oacute;n o el tratamiento?

No. 39 (10/92)
<H1>CHILDREN OF PARENTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS</H1> 
	Mental illnesses in parents represent a risk for children in the family.  These children have a higher risk for developing mental illnesses than other children. <P>

	The risk is particularly strong when the parent's illness is manic-depressive illness, schizophrenia, alcoholism or other drug abuse, or major depression.  When both parents are mentally ill, the chance is even greater that the child might become mentally ill.<P>

	Risk can be inherited from parents, through the genes.  Some of the risk also comes from parents' behavior or moods.  Mental disorders can keep parents from providing the love and guidance necessary for a child's healthy development.  An inconsistent, unpredictable family environment contributes to psychiatric illness in children.  Mental illness can hurt the marriage and the parenting  abilities of the couple, which in turn hurts the child. <P>

	Some protective or positive things can decrease the risk to children, including:
<UL>
<LI>Children knowing their parents are ill and that the children are not to blame. 
<LI>A stable home environment. 
<LI>A sense of being loved by the ill parent. 
<LI>A naturally stable and happy personality in the child.
<LI>Inner strength and good coping skills in the child. 
<LI>A strong relationship with a healthy adult. 
<LI>Friends.
<LI>Interest in and success at school.
<LI>Other outside interests for the child.
<LI>Help from outside the family to improve the family environment (for example, marital psychotherapy, or a class in parenting). 
</UL>

	Medical, mental health or social service professionals working with mentally ill adults need to inquire about the children and adolescents, especially about their mental health and emotional development.  It is often useful for such youngsters to be referred to a child and adolescent psychiatrist for an evaluation. <P>

	Individual or family psychiatric treatment can help a child toward healthy development despite the problem of the parental psychiatric illness.  The child and adolescent psychiatrist can help the family work with the positive elements in the home and the natural strengths of the child.  With treatment, the family can learn ways to lessen the effects of the parent's mental illness on the child. <P>

	Unfortunately, families, professionals and society often pay most attention to the mentally ill parent, and ignore the children in the family.  Providing more attention and support to the children of a psychiatrically ill parent is an important way to help prevent mental illnesses from passing from one generation to the next.<P>

<H1>THE INFLUENCE OF MUSIC AND ROCK VIDEOS</H1> 

	Singing and music have always played an important role in learning and the communication of culture.  Children learn from the role models what they see and hear.  For the past 30 years, some children's television has very effectively used the combination of words, music and fast-paced animation to achieve learning. <P>

	Most parents are concerned about what their young children see and hear, but as children grow older, parents pay less attention to the music and videos that hold their children's interest. <P>

	The sharing of musical tastes between generations in a family can be a pleasurable experience.  Music also is often a major part of a teenager's separate world.  It is quite common for teenagers to get pleasure from keeping adults out and causing adults some distress.<P>

	A concern to many interested in the development and growth of teenagers is a serious deterioration in the messages of some rock music, including best-selling albums promoted by major record companies.  The following troublesome themes are prominent: 
<UL>
<LI>Advocating and glamorizing abuse of drugs and alcohol. 
<LI>Pictures and explicit lyrics presenting suicide as an "alternative" or "solution." 
<LI>Graphic violence. 
<LI>Preoccupation with the occult;  songs about satanism and human sacrifice, and the apparent enactment of these rituals in concerts.  
<LI>Sex which focuses on controlling sadism, masochism, incest, devaluing women, and violence toward women.
</UL>	
<P>

Parents can help their teenagers by paying attention to their teenager's purchasing, listening and viewing patterns, and by helping them identify music that may be destructive. <P>

	Music is not usually a danger for a teenager whose life is happy and healthy.  But if a teenager is persistently preoccupied with music that has seriously destructive themes, and there are changes in behavior such as isolation, depression, alcohol or other drug abuse, a psychiatric evaluation should be considered. <P>

<H1>THE AUTISTIC CHILD</H1>

	When an infant or toddler does not cuddle, make eye contact or respond to affection and touching, parents are seriously concerned.  This lack of responsiveness may be accompanied by an inability to communicate, and by a persistent failure to develop two-way social relationships in any situation.  Many autistic children fail to show a preference for parents over other adults and do not develop friendships with other children.  The language skills may be poor, even nonexistent. Language skills as well as facial expressions and gestures are not used in a communicative manner. When a child shows these symptoms, "infantile autism" is one of the diagnoses that the child and adolescent psychiatrist will consider.<P>

	The autistic child's relationship to objects is not normal.  The child may show unusual, extreme responses to objects--either avoidance or preoccupation.  For example, the autistic child whose bed is moved from one side of the room to another may scream.  Moving objects such as a fan hold great fascination, and the child may form an unusual attachment to odd objects such as a paper, rubber band or brick.<P>

	Another feature of autism is a tendency toward repetitive activities of a restrictive range. Spinning and rhythmic body movements such as arm flapping may occur.  High functioning autistic children may repeat television commercials or indulge in complex bedtime rituals.<P>

	Parents who suspect autism in their child should ask their family doctor or pediatrician to refer them to a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who can accurately diagnose the autism and the degree of severity, and determine the appropriate educational measures.  Autism is a disease;autistic children may have a serious lifelong disability.  However, with appropriate treatment and training, some autistic children can develop certain aspects of independence in their lives.  Parents should support their autistic children in developing those skills that use their strengths so they will feel good about themselves.<P>

	In addition to working with the autistic child, the child and adolescent psychiatrist can help the family resolve stress--for example, a feeling among the siblings that they are being neglected in favor of the autistic child, or embarrassment about bringing their friends home.  The child and adolescent psychiatrist can help parents with the emotional problems that may arise as a result of living with an autistic child and also help them provide the best possible nurturing and learning environment for the child.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN OF ALCOHOLICS</H1> 
	At least seven million American children have alcoholic parents.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists know these children are at greater risk for having emotional problems than children whose parents are not alcoholics.  Alcoholism runs in families, and children of alcoholics are four times more likely than other children to become alcoholics.<P>
	A child in such a family may have a variety of problems: 
<UL>
<LI>Guilt. The child may see himself or herself as the main cause of the mother's or father's drinking.
<LI>Anxiety.  The child may worry constantly about the situation at home.  He or she is afraid the alcoholic parent will become sick or injured, and may also fear fights and violence between the parents. 
<LI>Embarrassment.  Parents may give the message that there is a terrible secret at home.  The ashamed child does not invite friends home and is afraid to ask anyone for help.
<LI>Inability to have close relationships.  Because the child has been disappointed by the drinking parent many times, he or she often does not trust others.
<LI>Confusion.  The alcoholic parent will change suddenly from being loving to angry, regardless of the child's behavior.  A regular daily schedule, which is very important for a child, does not exist because bedtimes and mealtimes are constantly changing. 
<LI>Anger.  The child feels anger at the alcoholic parent for drinking, and may be angry at the non-alcoholic parent for lack of support and protection.
<LI>Depression.  The child feels lonely and helpless to change the situation.
</UL>	     
	Although the child tries to keep the alcoholism a secret, teachers, relatives, other adults or friends may sense that something is wrong.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists advise that the following behaviors may signal a drinking problem at home: 
<UL>
<LI>Failure in school; truancy.
<LI>Lack of friends;  withdrawal from classmates. 
<LI>Delinquent behavior, such as stealing or violence.
<LI>Frequent physical complaints, such as headaches or stomachaches.
<LI>Abuse of drugs or alcohol.
<LI>Aggression towards other children. 
</UL>
	Some children of alcoholics may act like responsible "parents" within the family and among friends.  They may cope with the alcoholism by becoming controlled, successful "overachievers" throughout school, and at the same time be emotionally isolated from other children and teachers.  Their emotional problems may show only when they become adults. <P>

	Whether or not their parents are receiving treatment for alcoholism, these children and adolescents can benefit from educational programs and mutual-help groups such as programs for children of alcoholics, Al-Anon and Alateen.  Professional help, the earlier the better, is also important in preventing more serious problems for the child, including alcoholism.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists help these children with their own problems, and also help them to understand they are not responsible for the drinking problems of their parents. <P>

	The treatment program may include group therapy with other youngsters, which reduces the isolation of being a child of an alcoholic.  The child and adolescent psychiatrist will often work with the entire family--particularly when the alcoholic parent has stopped drinking--to help them develop healthier ways of relating to one another. <P>

<H1>DISCIPLINE</H1>

	 Helping a child to behave in an acceptable manner is a necessary part of raising the child well.  Discipline varies at different ages.  There is no one right way to raise children, but child and adolescent psychiatrists offer the following general guidelines: Children generally want to please their parents.  Wise parents can in their disciplining activities use children's desire to please.<P>

	 When parents show joy and approval for behavior that please them, this reinforces good behavior in the child.  When parents show disapproval of dangerous or unpleasant behaviors at the early stages, they are more likely to be successful when the child is older. The way the parent corrects a child or adolescent for misbehavior should make sense to the youngster, and not be too strict that the child or adolescent cannot later feel the parent's love and good intentions.<P>

	 Children and adolescents can and do anger parents, and parents need good self-control when they are angry.  Although a loud "no" may get the attention of a toddler heading for a street full of traffic, it does not quiet a crying baby.  For older children, there should be clear expectations, agreed upon by both parents and clearly told to the child or adolescent. In our mixed society, where cultures and parenting styles are varied, different families expect different behaviors from their children.<P>

	 One child may be allowed to come home at any time, while another child may have a strict curfew.  When parents and children disagree about rules, an honest exchange of ideas may help them learn from each other.  However, parents must be responsible for setting the family's rules and values. Keeping unwanted behavior from happening in the first place is easier than stopping it later.<P>

	 It is better to put breakable or treasured objects out of the reach of  toddlers than to punish them for breaking them.  Parents should encourage curiosity but should direct it into activities like playing with puzzles, learning to use paints or reading a book. Changing a child's unwanted behaviors can help the child have the self-control needed to become responsible and considerate of others. Self-control does not happen automatically or suddenly.  Infants and toddlers need parental guidance and support to begin the process of learning self-control.  Self-control usually begins to show by age six.  With parents guiding the process, self-control increases throughout the school years.  Teenage experimentation and rebellion may occur, but most youngsters pass through this period and become responsible adults--especially if they had good early training. Families pass methods of discipline and what is expected of children from generation to generation.  When discipline attempts are not successful, it is often helpful for someone outside the family to make useful suggestions on raising a child.  Professionals trained in child growth and behavior can give information on the way children think and develop.  They can also suggest different approaches to changing unwanted behavior.  The patience of parents, and help from caring professionals, when necessary, will help smooth the way for children to learn and enjoy what society expects of them and what they can expect from themselves.<P>

<H1>THE CONTINUUM OF CARE</H1>

	 Communities provide different types of treatment programs and services for children and adolescents with mental illnesses.  A complete range of programs and services is called the continuum of care.  Not every community has every type of program on the continuum.<P>

	  When parents are concerned about their child's behavior or emotions they should start with an evaluation by a qualified mental health professional such as a child and adolescent psychiatrist.  At the conclusion of the evaluation, the professional will recommend a certain type of program from the continuum available in the community.<P>

	  Each of the programs on the continuum offers several forms of treatment, such as individual psychotherapy, family therapy, group therapy and medications.<P>

	  A brief description of the different programs on the continuum of care follows:<P>

	 Office or outpatient clinic:  Visits are usually under one hour.  The number of visits per week depends on the youngster's needs.<P>

	   Intensive case management:  Specially trained individuals coordinate or provide psychiatric, financial, legal and medical services to help the child or adolescent live successfully at home and in the community.<P>

	  Home-based treatment program:  A team of specially trained staff go into a home and develop a treatment program to help the child and family.<P>

	  Day treatment program:  This intensive treatment program provides psychiatric treatment with special education.  The child usually attends five days per week.<P>

	  Partial hospitalization (day hospital):  This provides all the treatment services of a psychiatric hospital, but the patients go home each evening.   Emergency/crisis services:  24-hour-per-day services for emergencies (for example, hospital emergency room, mobile crisis team).  Respite care:  A patient stays briefly away from home with specially trained individuals.   Therapeutic group home or community residence:  This therapeutic program usually includes 6 to 10 children or adolescents per home, and may be linked with a day treatment program or specialized educational program.   Crisis residence:  This setting provides short-term (usually fewer than 15 days) crisis intervention and treatment.  Patients receive 24-hour-per-day supervision.   Residential treatment facility:  Seriously disturbed patients receive intensive and comprehensive psychiatric treatment in a campus-   like setting on a longer-term basis.   Hospital treatment:  Patients receive comprehensive psychiatric treatment in a hospital.  Treatment programs should be specifically designed for either children or adolescents.  Length of treatment may be acute (a few days to 30 days) or intermediate (30 to 120 days).   Parents should ask questions whenever a professional recommends psychiatric treatment for their child or adolescent.  For instance, which types of treatment are provided, and by whom?  Parents should also ask about the length of time, the cost, and the advantages and disadvantages of the recommended type of program.  Parents should always feel free to obtain a second opinion about the best type of program for their child or adolescent.<P>

No. 23 (10/92)
<H1>CHILDREN WHO ARE MENTALLY RETARDED</H1> 

	The term "mental retardation" is often misunderstood and seen as derogatory.  Some think that retardation is diagnosed only on the basis of below-normal intelligence (IQ), and that retarded persons are unable to learn or to care for themselves.  Actually, in order to be diagnosed as mentally retarded, the person has to have both significantly low IQ and considerable problems in adapting to everyday life.  However, most children who are retarded can learn a great deal, and as adults can lead at least partially independent lives.  Most importantly, they can enjoy their lives just as everyone else. <P>

	In the past, parents were usually advised to institutionalize a significantly retarded child.  This is not done anymore.  Now these children are expected to stay in the family and take part in community life.  The law guarantees them educational and other services at public expense. <P>

	Retardation may be complicated by physical and emotional problems.  The child may also have difficulty with hearing, sight or speech.  All these problems can lower the child's potential. <P>

	It is very important that the child has a comprehensive evaluation to find out about his or her difficulties as well as strengths.  Since no specialist has all the necessary skills, many professionals might be involved.  General medical tests as well as tests in areas such as neurology (the nervous system), psychology, psychiatry, special education, hearing, speech and vision, and physical therapy are useful.  A pediatrician or a child and adolescent psychiatrist often coordinate these tests.<P>

	These physicians refer the child for the necessary tests and consultations, put together the results, and jointly with the family and the school develop a comprehensive treatment and education plan. <P>

	Emotional and behavioral disorders are a frequent complication of mental retardation, and they may interfere with the child's progress.  Most retarded children recognize that they are behind others of their own age.  Some may become frustrated, withdrawn or anxious, or act "bad" to get the attention of other youngsters and adults.  Retarded adolescents and young adults may become depressed.  These persons might not have enough language skills to talk about their feelings, and their depression may be shown by new problems, for instance in their behavior, eating and sleeping. <P>

	Early diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in retarded youngsters may lead to early treatment.  Contrary to common belief, medications are not the only means of treating persons who are retarded, and most of them can benefit from other psychiatric treatment as well. <P>

	A periodic child psychiatric consultation may help the family in setting appropriate expectations, limits, opportunities to succeed and other measures which will help their retarded child to handle the stresses of growing up into a fulfilled person. <P>

<H1>NI&Ntilde;OS CON RETRASO MENTAL</H1>
<P>El t&eacute;rmino retraso o retardaci&oacute;n mental es mal entendimiento con frecuencia y a menudo visto en sentido despreciativo. Muchas personas piensan que el retraso mental se diagnostica solamente bas&aacute;ndose en el cociente intelectual, (C.I.) y que los retrasados mentales son incapaces de aprender o valerse por si mismos. La realidad es que para establecer el diagn&oacute;stico de retraso mental se toma en consideraci&oacute;n un cociente de inteligencia (IQ) significativamente bajo, as&iacute; como deficicncias o problemas en la capacidael adaptativa. Esto &uacute;ltimo se refiere a la eficacia mediante la cual un individuo se enfrenta a la vida cotidiana e incluye cualidades de independencia personal y responsabilidad social, esperadas para su edad y grupo cultural. La mayor parte de los retrasados mentales pueden aprender bastante y al llegar a adultos pueden llevar una vida por lo menos parcialmente independiente. Importante tambi&eacute;n es que puedan lograr disfrutar de sus vidas como cualquier otra persona normal.
<P>En el pasado se aconsejaba a los padres que internaran a estos ni&ntilde;os en alguna instituci&oacute;n, &eacute;sto ya no se hace. Es preferible que estos ni&ntilde;os permanezcan con su familia y participen de la vida comunitaria. La ley les garantiza educaci&oacute;n y otros servicios pagados con fondos p&uacute;blicos.
<P>El retraso mental puede complicarse con otros problemas f&iacute;sicos o emocionales. El ni&ntilde;o puede tener tambi&eacute;n dificultades del habla y/o lenguaje, visuales o auditivos. Estos problemas pueden disminuir el potencial del ni&ntilde;o.
<P>Es muy importante hacerle al ni&ntilde;o una evaluaci&oacute;n completa para detectar tanto sus dificultades como sus capacidades. Ya que no hay un especialista que domine todos los campos es necesario que participen en la evaluaci&oacute;n de especialistas de varias disciplinas: ex&aacute;menes de m&eacute;dicos generales, neurol&oacute;gicos (sistema nervioso), psicol&oacute;gicos, psiqui&aacute;tricos, educaci&oacute;n especial, ex&aacute;menes auditivos, del habla, de la vista, de terapia fisica y otros. Muchas veces cstos estudios son coordinados por el Psiquiatra de Ninos y Adolescentes o el E'ediatra. Estos m&eacute;dicos pueden referir al ni&ntilde;o para estas consultas. Al rccibir los rcsultados, &eacute;stos reuncn a la familia y a otras personas necesarias para dise&ntilde;ar un plan de manejo comprensivo, incluyendo tratamicnto y educaci&oacute;n a tenor con las necesidndes dcl ni&ntilde;o.
<P>Problemas emocionales y de conducta complican muchas veccs cl retraso mental y pueden interferir con el progreso del ni&ntilde;o. La mayoria de los ni&ntilde;os con retraso mental se dan cuenta de sus limitaciones al compararse con otros de su edad. Esto les frustra, les torna ansiosos o se aislan. En ocasiones se portan mal con el prop&oacute;sito de llamar la atenci&oacute;n de otros j&oacute;venes o de los adultos. Con frecuencia adolescentes y adultos j&oacute;venes con retraso se deprimen. Puede que sus destrczas comunicol&oacute;gicas sean deficientes y al no poder expresar sus sentimientos, la deprcsi&oacute;n sea expresada de otras formas, como por ejcmplo, en la conducta, h&aacute;bitos del ni&ntilde;o, cambios alimenticios, etc.  El diagn&oacute;stico temprano de coml)licacioncs emocionales en el ni&ntilde;o con retraso mental es importante para la intervenci&oacute;n y el manejo temnl-ano. Contrario a la creencia general, los medicamentos no 50ll la &uacute;nica alternativa para el manejo de los problemas. Muchos ni&ntilde;os ?ueden beneficiarse de otras formas de tratamiento.
<P>Visitas peri&oacute;dicas de seguimiento psiqui&aacute;trico pueden ser &uacute;tiles para la familia. En las mismas se pueden tratar asuntos como el poner cn vigor controles apropiados y efectivos, mantener expectativas razonables, buscar alternativas para desarrollo m&aacute;ximo del potencial as&iacute; como otras medidas que se puedan tomar para ayudar al ni&ntilde;o a enfrentarse a las m&uacute;ltiples tensiones y poder vivir una vida razonablemente feliz.

No. 3 (10/92)
<H1>TEENS: ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS</H1>

	Most teenagers will have some experience with alcohol and other drugs.  Most will experiment and stop, or continue to use casually without significant problems.  Some will use regularly, with varying degrees of physical, emotional and social problems.  Some will develop a dependency and be destructive to themselves and others for many years.  Some will die, and some will cause others to die.<P>
	Some people grow out of their use of alcohol and other drugs.  But since there is no certain way to predict which teenagers will develop serious problems, all use should be considered dangerous.  Saying no is often part of the solution, but "just saying no" is seldom enough.<P>
	Some teenagers are more "at risk" than others to develop alcohol and other drug-related problems.  Highest on the list are those teenagers with a family history of Substance Abuse problems.
	Legally available products include alcohol (over 21) and tobacco (over a certain age),prescribed medications, inhalants and over-the-counter cough, cold, sleep and diet medications.  Illegal drugs include marijuana, cocaine/"crack," LSD, PCP, opioids, heroin and "designer drugs."<P>
	Although the use of some drugs has leveled off recently, the use of others has not.  In particular, usage rates of alcohol, cigarettes and "crack" remain major areas of concern.<P>
	Those who begin to smoke or drink during their early teens are at particularly high risk.  These substances are the typical "gateway drugs" which lead first to marijuana, and then to other illegal drugs.  Most adolescents continue using the earlier drugs as they begin using still others.
	Warning signs of teenage drug abuse may include:
<UL>
<LI>Physical: lasting fatigue, repeated health complaints, red and dull eyes, and a steady cough.
<LI>Emotional: personality change, sudden mood changes, irresponsible behavior, low self-esteem, depression, and a general lack of interest.
<LIFamily:   starting arguments, breaking rules, or withdrawing from the family.
<LI>School:   drop in grades, many absences, discipline problems.
<LI>Social problems:    new friends who are less interested in standard home and school activities, scrapes with the law, and changes to less conventional styles in dress and music.
</UL>	
Substance of the warning signs listed above can also be signs of other problems.  Parents may recognize signs of trouble but should not be expected to make the diagnosis. An effective way for parents to show care and concern for their teenager is with them to honestly discuss the use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs.<P>
	Consulting a physician to rule out physical causes of the warning signs is a good first step.  This should often be followed or accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation by a child and adolescent psychiatrist.<P>

<H1>ADOLESCENTES, DROGAS Y ALCOHOL</H1>

<P>A los psiquiatras de ni&ntilde;os se les pide con frecuencia que eval&uacute;en y traten adolescentes que abusan de las drogas y el alcohol.

<P>Rara vez estos adolescentes buscan tratamiento por su propia voluntad. Por lo contrario, buscan excusas para explicar y justificar sus s&iacute;ntomas y luchan por mantener su &quot;derecho de beber&quot;. Por ejemplo, un adolescente puede decir que el olvido de una cita o el no completar tal o cual tarea se debi&oacute; a la preocupaci&oacute;n que ten&iacute;a por unos ex&aacute;menes que se acercaban. El o ella puede tratar de explicar el enrojecimiento, hinchaz&oacute;n de sus ojos o pupilas dilatadas con excusas triviales; por ejemplo, diciendo que jug&oacute; muchos juegos de video o que estudi&oacute; hasta muy tarde.

<P>El joven puede comenzar a organizar su vida alrededor de aquellas actividades que le brinden la oportunidad para hacer uso de bebidas alcoh&oacute;licas o drogas mientras ignora otras responsabilidades para con la familia o la escuela. Otros cambios persistentes en la vida de su adolescente puede alertarle: como por ejemplo, fracasos inesperados en la escuela, tardanzas o ausentismo poco com&uacute;n en &eacute;l. Usted puede notar que ya no conoce a los amigos o a las actividades de su hijo. Cambios en la forma de vestir o apariencia, o cambios en los patrones del sue&ntilde;o o alimentaci&oacute;n puede ser otras claves que nos lleven a sospechar proble ma s con la droga o la bebida. La mejor forma de demostrar al hijo su inter&eacute;s por &eacute;l y su preocupaci&oacute;n por lo que est&aacute; sucediendo, es hablar con &eacute;l sobre cambios en su conducta.

<P>Aunque puede que usted se sienta molesto, la empat&iacute;a y el tratar de entender lo que est&aacute; sucediendo es un enfoque mejor que la expresi&oacute;n de sentimiento de culpa y coraje. Una decisi&oacute;n fi rme de enfrentarse al problema as&iacute; como un a resoluci&oacute;n fa mi liar de ayuda es igualmente necesaria. Para ayuda profesional, pida a su m&eacute;dico que le refiera a un psiquiatra de ni&ntilde;os.

No. 29 (10/92)
<H1>CHILDREN'S MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS</H1> 

	A child with a "major psychiatric disorder" has a very serious illness affecting several areas of the child's life.  These areas may include emotions, social or intellectual ability, or the use of language.  Children with major psychiatric disorders may also have physical problems or may also be mentally retarded. <P>

	When a child and adolescent psychiatrist examines a child to learn if he or she has a major psychiatric disorder, these are some of the signs they look for or ask parents about: 
<UL>
<LI>Failure to look or smile at parents or other care givers;
<LI>Very strange actions or appearance;
<LI>Lack of movement or facial expression;
<LI>Lack of interest in or awareness of other people;
<LI>Odd way of speaking, or private language that no one else can understand;
<LI>Strange conversations with him- or herself;
<LI>Odd or repetitive movements, such as spinning, hand-flapping, or headbanging; and
<LI>Panic in response to a change in surroundings.  
</UL>

	There are many different kinds of major psychiatric disorders.  The specific name given to a child's illness will depend upon the combination of symptoms listed above, and on how severe the illness is. <P>

	Major psychiatric disorders often last a long time, and may be lifelong.  However, when children with these disorders begin treatment early, their health and ability to perform everyday tasks will usually improve. <P>

	When parents are concerned that their child may have a major psychiatric disorder, they should seek a comprehensive evaluation as soon as possible.  Observant parents, pediatricians, teachers and others who see the child regularly can compare the child with others in his or her age group.  Their observations are very helpful in the formation of an initial assessment of the child's problem. <P>

	A comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan will then involve a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who coordinates his or her own findings with those of parents, special educators, pediatricians, neurologists and developmental and psychological tests. <P>

	Comprehensive treatment will involve coordinating several of the following:
<UL>
<LI>Psychotherapy;
<LI>Specific learning programs;
<LI>Specific social skill and behavior programs;
<LI>Psychiatric medication;
<LI>Special schools or hospitals; and 
<LI>Active involvement by the family.  
</UL>

	Perhaps because children change so much as they grow, diagnosis of major psychiatric disorders in youngsters is one of the most difficult areas of medicine.  Thus, it is extremely important that physicians with adequate training and experience be involved in helping the child, and that parents seek help as soon as they begin to be worried about their child.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN AND FAMILY MOVES</H1>
	
	Moving to a new community may be one of the most stress-producing experiences a family faces.  Frequent moves or even a single move can be especially hard on a youngster, and this stress occurs even when there are siblings. <P>

	Moves interrupt friendships.  To a new child at school, it may at first seem that everyone else has a best friend or is securely involved in a clique.  The child must get used to a different curriculum, and finds him or herself ahead on certain subjects and behind on others, causing boredom and anxiety. <P>

	Children in kindergarten or first grade may be particularly vulnerable to a family move because developmentally they are just in the process of separating from their parents and adjusting to new authority figures and peer groups.  The relocation can interfere with that normal process of separation by causing them to return to a more dependent relationship with their parents. <P>

	In general, the older the child, the more difficulty he or she will have with the move because of the increasing importance of the peer group.  Pre-teens and teenagers may repeatedly protest the move, or ask to stay in their hometown with a friend's family.     Some youngsters may not talk about their distress, so parents should be aware of the warning signs of depression, including changes in appetite, withdrawal, a drop in grades, irritability, sleep disturbances or other dramatic changes in behavior. <P>

	Children who seem depressed by a move may be reacting less to the relocation than to the stress of their parents settling in to a new area.  Sometimes one parent may be against the move, and children will sense and react to this parental discord. <P>

	If the child shows persistent signs of depression or distress, parents can ask their family doctor, their pediatrician or the local medical society to refer them to a child and  adolescent psychiatrist, who can diagnose and treat physical as well as emotional problems that may affect children as a result of stress.  The child and adolescent psychiatrist can also help parents learn how to make the new experience easier on the entire family. <P>

	To make the move easier on children, parents may take these steps:  
<UL>
<LI>Explain clearly to the children why the move is necessary.  
<LI>Familiarize the children as much as possible with the new area with maps, photographs or the daily newspaper.  
<LI>Describe advantages of the new location that the child might appreciate such as a lake, mountain or an amusement park.  
<LI>After the move, get involved with the children in activities of the local church or synagogue, PTA, scouts, YMCA, etc.  
<LI>If a son or daughter is a senior in high school, consider the possibility of letting him or her stay with a trusted family until the school year is over. 
</UL>
	The more frequently a family moves, the more important is the need for internal stability.  With the proper attention from parents and professional help if necessary, moving can be a positive growth experience for children, leading to increased self-confidence and interpersonal skills.<P>

<H1>MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT </H1>

	Many children and adolescents use alcohol and other drugs.  Some develop serious problems. <P>

	There are many types of substance abuse treatment--based in offices, special treatment centers, and hospitals.  The decision to entrust a child or adolescent to any type of treatment deserves serious consideration.  Parents are encouraged to seek consultation from a child and adolescent psychiatrist when making decisions about substance abuse treatment for children or adolescents. <P>

	Properly informed, parents and families can contribute effectively to the treatment process.  By asking the following questions when substance abuse treatment is recommended, parents can obtain important information.<P>

<OL>
<LI>Why do you believe this treatment in this program is indicated for my child?

<H1>PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATION FOR CHILDREN</H1> 

	Medication may be an effective part of the treatment for several psychiatric disorders for childhood and adolescence.  The doctor's recommendation to use medication often raises many concerns and questions in both the parents and the youngster.  The physician who recommends medication should be experienced in using it to treat psychiatric illnesses in children and adolescents.  He or she should fully explain the reasons for its use, what benefits it should provide, its unwanted effects or dangers, and treatment alternatives. <P>

	Psychiatric medication should not be used alone.  It should be part of a comprehensive treatment plan, usually including medical psychotherapy. <P>

	Before recommending any medication, the child and adolescent psychiatrist examines the youngster and makes a thorough diagnostic evaluation.  In some cases, the evaluation will include psychological testing, laboratory tests, and consultation with other medical specialists. 
	Psychiatric medications may be prescribed for a number of problems.  From less to more serious, these disorders include:
<OL>
<LI>Bedwetting - if it persists regularly after age 5 and causes serious problems in low self-esteem and social interaction.  
<LI>Specific fears (phobias) or general anxiety - if it keeps the youngster from normal daily activities.  
<LI>Attention deficit hyperactive disorder - marked by a short attention span, trouble concentrating and restlessness.  The child is easily upset and frustrated, and usually has trouble in school. 
<LI>School phobia (separation anxiety) - a fear of leaving home.  The child refuses to go to school or repeatedly feels too sick to go. 
<LI>Depression - lasting feelings of sadness, helplessness, hopelessness, unworthiness and guilt, inability to feel pleasure, a decline in school work and changes in sleeping and eating habits.  
<LI>Eating disorder - either self-starvation (anorexia nervosa) or binge eating and vomiting (bulimia), or a combination of the two.  
<LI>Manic-depressive condition - periods of depression alternating with manic periods, which may include irritability, "high" or happy mood, excessive energy, behavior problems, staying up late at night, and grand plans.  
<LI>Psychosis - symptoms include irrational beliefs, paranoia, hallucinations (seeing things or hearing sounds that don't exist) social withdrawal, clinging, strange behavior, extreme stubbornness, persistent rituals,   deterioration of personal habits.  
</OL>

	There are major categories of psychiatric medication: 
<UL>
<LI>Stimulant medication - such as dexedrine or methylphenidate (Ritalin).  Useful as part of the reatment for attention deficit hyperactive disorder. 
<LI>Anti-depressants - used in the treatment of serious depression, school phobias, some other serious anxiety disorders, bedwetting, some bulimic-type eating disorders and attention deficit hyperactive disorder. 
<LI>Antipsychotic medication ("major tranquilizers") - such as Haldol, Stelazine, or Thorazine.  Usually gives more inner control to the psychotic patient;  stops or at least takes the panic out of irrational beliefs and  hallucinations.  
<LI>Lithium and carbamazepine (Tegretol) - very helpful in treating and preventing manic-depressive episodes.  
<LI>Anti-anxiety medications - short-term use for certain conditions associated with high anxiety.
</UL>
	Their usefulness in children has not been well studied, so they should be prescribed only by a physician with experience in their use.  <P>

	Child and adolescent psychiatrists stress that medications which have beneficial effects also have unwanted side effects, ranging from just annoying to very serious.  Psychiatric medication should be used as part of a comprehensive plan of treatment, with ongoing evaluation and, in most cases, medical psychotherapy.  When prescribed appropriately by an experienced physician, medication may help children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders feel restored to their normal selves.  <P>

<H1>MEDICAMENTOS EN EL TRATAMIENTO DE CONDICIONES PSIQUIATRICAS EN NI&Ntilde;OS Y ADOLESCENTES</H1>

<P>Los medicamentos pueden ser necesarios en el tratamiento efectivo de varios trastornos psiqui&aacute;tricos de la ni&ntilde;ez y la adolescencia. La recomendaci&oacute;n del m&eacute;dico sobre el uso de medicamentos suele preocupar y traer preguntas en los padres y al menor. El m&eacute;dico que recomienda medicaci&oacute;n tiene que tener experiencia en su uso para las condiciones indicadas. Debe poder explicar en detalle las indicaciones para su uso, los beneficios que se esperan obtener, los efectos deseables e indeseables, asi como otras alternativas terap&eacute;uticas.
<P><B>Los medicamentos si ui&aacute;tricos no se deben usar solos.</B> Deben ser parte de un plan de tratamiento comprensivo, incluyendo usualmente psicoterapia.
<P>Antes de recomendar un medicamento el Psiquiatra de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes examinar&aacute; al ni&ntilde;o y hara una evaluaci&oacute;n diagn&oacute;stica detallada. En algunos casos esta evaluaci&oacute;n incluir&aacute; pruebas psicol&oacute;gicas, de laboratorio ylo consulta con otras especialidades m&eacute;dicas. Los medicamentos psiqui&aacute;tricos pueden ser recetados para un n&uacute;mero de problemas que var&iacute;an en severidad. Los siguientes des&oacute;rdenes ordenados de menor a mayor severidad pueden ser manejados con ayuda de medicamentos:

<OL>
<LI>Orinarse en la cama (Enuresis) - cuando dicho h&aacute;bito persiste despu&eacute;s de los 5 a&ntilde;os y causa problemas serios de es timaci&oacute;n prop ia e interacc i&oacute;n social del ni&ntilde;o.
<LI>Miedos, Fobias o Ansiedad (Angustia) - Si estas impiden la participaci&oacute;n del ni&ntilde;o en actividades cotidianas.

</OL>

<P>A continuaci&oacute;n describimos las categorias generales de medicamentos &uacute;tiles en el tratamiento de condiciones psiquifitricas.

<UL>
<LI>Estimulantes - incluye substancias como dexedrina o metilfenidato (Ritalin). Utiles para el tratamiento de trastornos de d6ficit de atenci&oacute;n especialmente si tiene hiperactividad.

<LI>Litio y Carbomezapina (Tegretol) - Muy &uacute;til en el tratamiento y prevenci&oacute;n de episodios maniaco depresivo.
<LI>Ansiolfticos (Anti-ansiedad) - Para el tratamiento a corto plazo de condiciones asociadas a un alto grado de ansiedad (angustia). Su efectividad en los ni&ntilde;os no ha sido extensamente estudiada, por lo que se recomienda uso cauteloso. Deben ser recetadas por medicos que hayan tenido experiencia en su uso.
</UL>

<P> Los Psiquiatras de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes enfatizan que el uso de medicamentos en los ni&ntilde;os puede tener efectos positivos pero que tambi&eacute;n tienen efectos secundarios indeseahles que var&iacute;an en severidad y seriedad. Los medicamentos deben de ser utilizados como parte de un plan comprensivo (total) de tratamiento, con evaluaciones peri&oacute;dicas, y en muchas ocasiones acompa&ntilde;adas de psicoterapia m&eacute;dica. Cuando son recetados por m&eacute;dicos diestros y conocedores tanto de las condiciones como de los medicamentos, &eacute;stos pueden ser de gran utilidad en restituir el funcionamiento del ni&ntilde;o a un nivel normal.

<IMG vspace=2 SRC= "/web/images/dot_clear.gif"> <BR>
	Parents are usually the first to recognize that their child has a problem with emotions or behavior.  Parents' growing concerns, and observations of outside resources such as teachers and family combine to form a process of coming to the realization that a child can benefit from treatment.  Parents may also consult with the child and adolescent psychiatrist or other professionals about ways to help their youngster at home. <P>

	Following are a few signs which may indicate that a child and adolescent psychiatric evaluation will be useful.

<H4>	YOUNGER CHILDREN</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Marked fall in school performance.
<LI>Poor grades in school despite trying very hard.
<LI>A lot of worry or anxiety, as shown by regular refusal to go to school, go to sleep or take part in activities that are normal for the child's age. 
<LI>Hyperactivity; fidgeting; constant movement beyond regular playing.
<LI>Persistent nightmares.

<H1>CHILDREN WHO CAN'T PAY ATTENTION</H1>

	Parents are distressed to receive a note from school saying that their child "won't listen to the teacher" or "causes trouble in class."  One possible reason for this kind of behavior is Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).<P>
	Even though the child with ADHD often wants to be a good student, the impulsive behavior and inability to pay proper attention in class interfere.  Teachers, parents and friends know that the child is "misbehaving" or "different," but they might not be able to tell exactly what is wrong.  A child and adolescent psychiatrist can diagnose and treat the child with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.<P>
	The "hyperactivity" symptoms in ADHD may include excessive running or climbing in young children, or extremely restless and fidgety behavior in older children.  In contrast to a normal high level of activity in some children, hyperactivity is haphazard, poorly organized and not goal-directed.  ADHD is ten times more common in boys than in girls.<P>
	A child who has ADHD shows several of the following characteristics:
<UL>
<LI>Has difficulty organizing work and gives the impression he or she has not heard instructions.
<LI>Is easily distracted.
<LI>Makes careless, impulsive errors.
<LI>Frequently calls out in class.
<LI>Has difficulty awaiting his or her turn in group situations.
<LI>Fails to follow through on parents' requests.
<LI>Is unable to play games for the same amount of time as other children of the same age.
</UL>

	Without proper treatment, the child may fall behind in schoolwork, and friendships may suffer because of poor cooperation in playing and other social activities.  Self-esteem suffers because the child experiences more failure than success and is criticized by teachers and family who do not recognize a health problem.<P>

	Research clearly documents that medication can be helpful, and that medication prescribed for ADHD works best as part of a comprehensive plan of treatment including ongoing evaluation and, often, medical psychotherapy for the child, help for the family, and consultation with teachers.<P>

	If a child shows behavior problems like those of ADHD, parents may ask their pediatrician or family physician to refer them to a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who can diagnose and treat the child for this illness.  By meeting with the child and adolescent psychiatrist, parents can learn how to cope with their child's problem.  In addition, the child psychiatrist often helps teachers and school officials work out ways to teach more effectively those children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.<P>

<H1>STEPFAMILY PROBLEMS </H1>

	A new stepfamily faces many challenges.  Stepfamily members have experienced important losses.  They have no shared family histories or shared ways of doing things, and they may have very different beliefs.  As with any achievement, developing good stepfamily relationships requires a lot of effort. <P>

	According to child and adolescent psychiatrists, a youngster may feel torn between the parents he or she lives with, and the "divorced" parent who lives somewhere else.  In addition, newly married couples may not have enough time alone to adjust to their new relationship. <P>

	If these challenges are faced creatively, members of the "blended" family can help build strong bonds among themselves through:
<UL>
<LI>Mourning their losses;
<LI>Developing new skills in making decisions as a family;
<LI>Fostering and strengthening new relationships between parents, as well as stepparent-to-stepchild and stepsibling-to-stepsibling; and 
<LI>Supporting one another in maintaining original parent-child relationships.  
</UL>
	
While facing these issues may be difficult, most stepfamilies do work out their problems by consulting grandparents, clergy, support groups and other community based programs.  But parents should consider getting a psychiatric evaluation when any family member feels:
<UL>
<LI>Alone dealing with the losses;
<LI>Torn between two parents or two households;
<LI>Excluded;
<LI>Isolated by feelings of guilt and anger;
<LI>Unsure about what is right, or 
<LI>Uncomfortable with any member of the original family or stepfamily.
</UL>

	The following signs, if they are lasting or persistent, also suggest the need for a psychiatric evaluation: 
<UL>
<LI>The child vents his or her anger upon a particular family member.
<LI>One of the parents suffers from great stress and is unable to help with the child's increased needs and anger.
<LI>A stepparent or parent openly favors one of the children, or a child resents a stepparent or parent. 
<LI>Only the natural parent, not the stepparent, is in charge of disciplining the child. 
<LI>Any member of the family gets no enjoyment from normally pleasurable activities such as learning, going to school, working, playing, or being with friends or family.  
</UL>

	Most stepfamilies--when given the needed time to work on developing their own traditions and to form new relationships--can provide emotionally rich and lasting relationships for the adults, and help the children develop the self-esteem and strength to enjoy the challenges of life.<P>

<H1>PROBLEMAS ASOCIADOS A LOS HIJASTROS(AS) Y SU NUEVA FAMILIA</H1>
<P>Una familia reci&eacute;n formada en la que hay hijastros(as) se enfrenta a muchos problemas. Varios de sus miembros han sostenido p&eacute;rdidas importantes. Estos no comparten historias o experiencias previas similares. A veces sus miembros tienen costumbres y creencias diferentes. El desarrollo de buenas relaciones entre los miembros de esta nueva familia compuesta requiere un gran esfuerzo.
<P>Los Psiquiatras de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes dicen que un ni&ntilde;o(a) en esta situaci&oacute;n se siente dividido(a) entre los padres con quien vive ahora y el padre o madre divorciado(a) que reside en otro lugar. A esto se le a&ntilde;ade que la ?areja reci&eacute;n casada puede a&uacute;n no haber tenido suficiente tiempo a solas para adaptarse a la nueva relaci&oacute;n.
<P>Estos problemas deben ser enfrentados con flexibilidad y creatividad. Asf los miembros de esta nueva familia pueden establccer v&iacute;nculos positivos si logran:

<UL>
<LI>Llorar sus p&eacute;rdidas.
<LI>Desarrollar nuevas habilidades para hacer decisiones en familia.
<LI>Fomentar y fortalecer las relaciones entre padre, madre e hijo(a), as&iacute; como entre el padrastro o madrastra con hijo(a) y entre los hermanastros.
<LI>Apoyo mutuo para mantener una buena relaci&oacute;n con el padre/madre ausente.
</UL>

<P>Aunque suele ser dificil enfrentarse a estas situaciones, la mayorfa de estas familias compuestas l)ueden resolver sus lzroblemas, consultando con los abuelos, sacerdotes o ministros, grupos de apoyo u otros programas de ayuda en la comunidad. Los padres dehcn dc considerar la necesidad de una evaluaci&oacute;n por un Psiquiatra de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes cuando alg&uacute;n miembro dc la familia persistentementc se sienta:
<UL>
<LI> Que se enfrenta solo a las p&eacute;didas
<LI> Dividido entre 2 padres y 2 hogares. 
<LI> Rue es exclutdo del grupo familiar. 
<LI> Aislado por sentimientos de culpa u odio. 
<LI> Inseguro acerca de lo que esta corrects o no. 
<LI> Inc&oacute;modo con miembros de la familia de origen o la nueva familia.

the Institute of Medicine (IOM), Research on Children and Adolescents with
Mental, Behavioral, and Developmental Disorders.  In the spring of 1994, the
American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry commissioned James Leckman,
M.D., and Glen Elliott, M.D., the original chair and vice-chair of the
Institute of Medicine Committee, along with other members of the original IOM
committee to prepare this report card to assess the progress on the National
Plan at the midway point, and to set a course for full implementation.<p>

<p>
<b>Introduction</b><p>
	In response to requests from the United States Senate and House of
Representatives, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) issued the
National Plan for Research on Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders in 1990.1
The impetus for this Plan came from the growing recognition that:<p>
Our Nation is needlessly wasting its most precious natural resource: our
children and youth. We are permitting more than 12 percent of our children and
adolescents - 7.5 million young Americans - to suffer from mental disorders,
often for life.  And we are doing far too little to develop the scientific
knowledge needed to treat or prevent their illness or lessen its enormous human
and financial costs.<p>
	The Plan was prepared by NIMH's National Advisory Mental Health Council
(NAMHC) and was based on a report from the Institute of Medicine, Research on
Children and Adolescents with Mental, Behavioral, and Developmental Disorders,2
and on the recommendations of a NAMHC Ad Hoc Advisory Group.<p>
	The five year National Plan focused on three immediate goals:<p>
	1. Develop and sustain a critical mass of basic and clinically oriented
researchers focused on mental disorders that afflict children and adolescents.
<p>
	2. Stimulate a wide range of basic and clinical research at the frontiers of
scientific inquiry. <p>
	3. Form an institute-wide consortium of NIMH program staff concerned with
child and adolescent mental health research to implement the National Plan.<p>
	The recommended budget for full implementation of the National Plan called for
a dramatic increase in monies directed towards research on child and adolescent
mental disorders; from $57.7 million in fiscal year (FY) 1987 and $92.3 million
in FY 1990 to $152.5 million in the first year (FY 1991) to $232.9 million in
the third year (FY 1993) to $283.3 million in the final and fifth year (FY
1995) (Figure 1). <p>
	This "Report Card" is based on information provided by NIMH in the form of
narrative summaries and financial data.  Detailed information was provided for
FY 1987 (a point in time before the National Plan was envisioned) and FY 1993
(the midpoint of the National Plan).  It is hoped that this critique will serve
to inform the field and assist NIMH in planning how best to achieve the
remaining goals as outlined in the National Plan.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Overview</b><p>
<b></b>	Consonant with the aims of the National Plan, there has been between a
203 to 220 percent overall increase in funding for research on child and
adolescent mental disorders from FY 1987 to FY 1993 (Figure 1).  The greatest
gain has been a seven-fold increase in services research.  Research on
prevention and AIDS also grew substantially.  Basic behavioral and biomedical
research has shown a slower rate of growth (179 percent).  The Intramural
Research Program has shown the slowest rate of growth (121 percent). Growth in
research training and career development also has been modest, with many
promising scientists failing to receive support because of a shortage of funds.
 <p>
	Given the targets established in the National Plan, the funding levels for the
first three years have consistently fallen short of those envisioned.  In the
third year of the National Plan (FY 1993), at most 58 percent of the target
level was achieved (Figure 1).<p>
 <b>Figure 1. Actual vs. Recommended Funding for Research on Child and
Adolescent Mental Disorders by the NIMH: FY 1987 to FY 1995 (projected).</b>
Based on figures made available by NIMH, the Institute has fallen well short of
its funding objectives as presented in the National Plan for Research on Child
and Adolescent Mental Disorders.1  The indeterminant zone refers to NIMH awards
that in some way involve children or adolescent populations but whose major
focus is on adult forms of mental disorder (see text). <b></b><p>
<b></b>Figure 2. Actual vs. Recommended Funding for the 03 Year of NIMH's
National<b> Plan for Research on Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders.</b>
Based on figures made available by NIMH, the Institute has fallen well short of
its funding objectives in the 03 year of the National Plan for Research on
Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders.1  The categories are taken from Table 1
(p. 47) of the publication describing the National Plan.1  The figures for
Clinical Research include funds for Prevention and AIDS research. The
indeterminant zone (Clinical Research and Total) refers to NIMH awards that in
some way involve children or adolescent populations but whose major focus is on
adult forms of mental disorder (see text). When these figures are adjusted for
the effects of inflation, the actual amount of money spent on NIMH's Intramural
child and adolescent research programs has actually suffered a 9 percent
decline.<p>
This percentage (actual/target X 100) has steadily declined from 78 percent in
the first year (FY 1991) to 63 percent in the second year (FY 1992) (Figure 1).
These estimates, however, are almost certain to be overly generous given the
difficulties associated with precisely dividing the amount of existing support
for clinical research into child and adult categories.  Indeed, these figures
include the entire funding for any grant that has at least some component
focused on children and/or adolescents.<p>
	To place these figures in perspective, it is important to consider both the
overall growth in the NIMH budget and the effects of inflation.  During the
period from FY 1987 to FY 1993, NIMH's total research budget increased 203
percent from $288 million in FY 1987 to $583 million in FY 1993.  Further, when
the effects of inflation are taken into account, the actual percentage increase
in the total NIMH research budget approximates only 152 percent.  The
comparable range for the inflation-adjusted increase in research funding for
child and adolescent disorders is between 152 percent and 165 percent.  Thus,
it is reasonable to conclude that during this period of increased funding for
research on mental disorders as a whole, funding for child and adolescent
mental disorders research simply kept pace (or perhaps did slightly better)
than the Institute as a whole. <p>
 	As detailed below, two other major accomplishments have been the creation of
the Institute-wide consortium charged with implementing the National Plan and
the formation of a new peer review panel focused on research proposals in the
child and adolescent mental disorders arena.<p>
	One area in which there has been much less progress than called for in the
National Plan concerns the need to disseminate more widely the current and
emerging research-based knowledge relevant to the diagnosis, treatment, and
prevention of child and adolescent mental disorders.  Although this task is
shared by advocacy groups, professional organizations, scientific and lay
journals, and by researchers themselves, NIMH's leadership in this area has
fallen well short of what is needed.  This is particularly true given the
ongoing debate on health care reform and the need to ensure adequate systems of
care for our children and youth.<p>
<p>
<b>Career Development</b><p>
	From FY 1987 to FY 1993 funding for research training and career development
has increased 188 percent (or a 141 percent increase after adjusting for the
effects of inflation).  There was an 146 percent increase in the number of
awards (summing across all relevant funding mechanisms).  This level of funding
is approximately 70 percent of what was hoped for in the National Plan (Figure
2).  Specific points include:<p>
	  In most areas, the proportion of funding devoted to research training and
career development is approximately 20 percent.  However, in the areas of
services research and prevention, the figures are markedly lower, 12 and two
percent, respectively.  Initiatives are needed to ensure that adequate numbers
of new investigators enter these crucially important areas of research.<p>
	  Consistent with the aims of the National Plan, the Institute-wide consortium
in conjunction with the Society of Professors of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry hosted a special workshop to stimulate new post-doctoral
institutional research training programs (T32).  This effort has been
successful with 8 new applications being submitted and 4 funded or soon to be
funded.  However, NIMH has administratively trimmed some existing T32s to make
new ones possible.  This is a painful and far from ideal situation.
Substantial new monies are needed in this area to take advantage of the
available research training resources.<p>
	  Since 1990, at least 20 worthy career development proposals ("K" Awards and
R29 FIRST Awards) have not been funded, despite having received priority scores
in the "outstanding" or the high end of the "excellent" range.  While some of
these grants have subsequently been funded on resubmission, many have not.
Additional support is needed to take full advantage of well-trained
investigators who are either just entering or who have made a commitment to
this area of research.<p>
	  In another career development initiative, the Institute-wide consortium
actively solicited new child-related research proposal summaries from several
hundred young investigators across the country interested in technical
assistance to prepare their grant applications.  Over 300 proposals
representing all areas of the NIMH were received (over three successive
workshops). From this pool, 170 candidates were invited to participate in
technical assistance workshops through 1993.  Additional workshops are planned
for 1994.  In addition, NIMH staff have been very active in presenting
technical assistance workshops at national professional meetings from 1991
through 1993.<p>
	  Additional training initiatives are needed to foster interdisciplinary
research.  Specific gaps include the need to train developmental
neuroscientists in the phenomenology and natural history of the various child
and adolescent mental disorders. In addition, patient-oriented researchers need
to become more acquainted with advances in the basic developmental
neurosciences and in vivo neuroimaging techniques.<p>
	In sum, partly as a result of NIMH's National Plan there has been considerable
growth in the area of career development of basic and clinical researchers
interested in child and adolescent mental disorders.  Significant gaps remain
particularly in the areas of services research and prevention.  More efforts
are needed to recruit, train, and sustain the careers of promising individuals
early in their scientific careers.<p>
<p>
<b>Basic Research</b><p>
<b>	</b>Basic behavioral and biomedical research focused on issues of
development has increased 179 percent (or a 134 percent increase after
adjusting for the effects of inflation) from FY 1987 to FY 1993.  In the third
year of the National Plan (FY 1993), the projected level of support was $78
million but the actual level of support was approximately $26.1 million (not
counting $8.2 million spent on research training and career development) or
just 33 percent of the target (Figure 2).  Most of the funded grants in this
area are project grants (R01s) with only one Center grant (P50) currently
funded.  Specific observations include:<p>
	  The last several years have produced substantial gains in our knowledge of
the basic factors that shape and influence the developing brain.  Advances in
our understanding of the role of genes in brain formation have been
particularly noteworthy.  Work in molecular genetics and developmental
neurobiology has identified several families of highly conserved genes which
appear to regulate the formation of the brain including the neocortex and other
subcortical structures that provide the neuroanatomical substrates for some of
our most distinctive human traits such as language and advanced problem-solving
skills.  As a result, we are on the threshold of gaining a more complete
understanding of the basic features of the genetic programming of brain
development.  Work in concert with other Institutes, such as the National
Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke (NINDS) and the National Institute
of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and private foundations is needed
to take advantage of this opportunity through mechanisms such as the Decade of
the Brain and the Human Brain Project.  <p>
	  Another conceptual advance is the discovery of the extent to which hormones
affect the developing brain.  Some of these hormonal signals may influence
crucial bonding and attachment behaviors.  It is likely that other gonadal
hormones influence the emergence of sexually dimorphic behaviors while yet
others are intimately involved in the response to various stressors.  Indeed,
the capacity of the brain to respond to circulating hormones is significant for
children because environmental stresses can affect the levels of circulating
hormones, and such fluctuations in hormone levels are known to alter
connections between neurons and/or permanently alter the activity and/or
responsivity of crucial brain circuits. Moreover, recent data from nonhuman
primates indicates that synaptic connections undergo dynamic and profound
changes well into late childhood. Identifying the hormonal and environmental
factors which potentially affect this process may aid in understanding normal
and abnormal learning process as they relate to cognition, socialization, and
other behaviors.<p>
	  Advances in neurobiologic research have changed the way we view and
understand the interactions between brain and environment.  Much of this work
is highly relevant to understanding the interactions between brain development,
children's growth and development (normal and pathologic), and the larger
environmental context.  For example, while science has traditionally sought to
discern the physiological and hormonal influences that affect behavior,
investigators are demonstrating the wide array of circumstances in which social
structure and social behavior have direct influence on physiological and
hormonal processes.  For example, it is likely that ecological risk factors
such as poverty and exposure to violence in the home or neighborhood will be
shown to have longstanding traumatic impact on brain structure and function as
well as subsequent behavioral adaptation.     <p>
	  Understanding how children develop and how pathological outcomes can occur
frequently benefits from broad multidisciplinary perspectives.  To advance
behavioral science in the child and adolescent area, there is a great need to
develop methodologies and measures that capture the complexities of multilevel
(physiological, behavioral, subjective, and contextual) approaches in studies
of infants, children, adolescents, and their families. NIMH needs to continue
and expand efforts that address the persistent gap between research paradigms
in developmental psychology and the other developmental neurosciences.  This
effort should build on the increasing recognition that understanding of
behavioral trajectories requires the examination of both social environmental
factors and neural change, as well as their reciprocal interaction.   <p>
	  Funding for basic behavioral and social science research often involves
longitudinal studies, which are inherently expensive and require stable
funding.  Recent accomplishments have highlighted the importance of early
interpersonal relationships in shaping later behavioral outcomes.
Specifically, a recent report from an ongoing longitudinal study of low income
families has found that the strongest predictor of hostile behavior in
childhood was the quality of the early mother-child relationship.  Other
studies of risk and protective factors have shown that neighborhood
characteristics such as the level of social disorganization and violence, in
addition to family and individual characteristics, affect the pathways taken by
urban adolescents in achieving academic success and personal competence.  Child
maltreatment is another understudied phenomenon.  To advance this area of
science ahead, grant mechanisms may need to be modified or developed to
encourage and support longitudinal research given the time constraints usually
associated with traditional research awards.<p>
	Given the dramatic growth of knowledge regarding genetic and environmental
factors that influence brain and behavioral development and the programmatic
initiatives already underway, it is surprising that an even larger investment
of resources has not been made.  At least keeping pace with other programmatic
initiatives would seem to be reasonable.<p>
<p>
<b>Clinical Research </b><p>
<b></b>	Clinical research including prevention research and research on special
populations (such as AIDS infected children) has shown a 250 to 280 percent (or
192 to 212 percent adjusted for inflation) increase in funding from FY 1987 to
FY 1993.  In the third year of the National Plan (FY 1993), the projected level
of support was $85 million and the actual level of support was somewhere
between $50 and $72 million.  The precision of all of these estimates is
limited by uncertainties about how much actual support for child and adolescent
mental disorders research is contained in grants awarded by NIMH that are coded
as falling within the child and adolescent domain.  In many instances, the
principal focus of the grant is on adult mental disorders but they have been
included in NIMH's totals because to a limited extent they touch on
developmental issues.  Depending on how these figures are weighted, this level
of funding is 59 to 85 percent of the target, with the 59 percent figure
probably being more accurate (Figure 2).  NIMH program staff have indicated
that there are many outstanding and excellent project grants (R01s) that are
not being funded because a shortage of funds.  Currently only three program
projects (P01s) and two Center grants (P50s) focus on the clinical mental
disorders of children and adolescents.  These numbers fall well short of the
goals of the National Plan.  <p>
	Specific points include:<p>
	  In the past several years, major programmatic efforts have been implemented
in the area of epidemiology of child and adolescent mental disorders.  In
particular, a key study has been the Cooperative Agreement for Methodologic
Research in Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders (MECA).  This was the first
phase of a major NIMH initiative which began in FY 1989.  The IOM report
Research on Children and Adolescents with Mental, Behavioral and Developmental
Disorders endorsed this effort and pointed out the need for reliable national
data concerning the prevalence and incidence of childhood mental disorders.
Although the changing picture of health care reform and the lack of information
concerning children's psychiatric and psychological service needs has resulted
in a major reorientation of this program, data from the MECA program have
provided the methodologic development and feasibility testing necessary for the
implementation of the Service Use, Need, Outcomes and Costs for Child and
Adolescent Populations (UNO-CAP) study, described below. <p>
	   NIMH has sponsored other major epidemiologic studies that have shed light
on various aspects of child and adolescent psychopathology.  One study compared
children's behavioral/emotional problems in 1979 and 1989 and found that these
problems were more prevalent in 1989 than in 1976. These results underscore the
importance of studies designed to assess the psychiatric and psychological
needs of children, the availability (or lack) of effective treatment and
services, and understanding societal changes that may place more children at
risk for mental disorders currently than was true in the past.<p>
	  Similar concerns are raised from findings reported in a study of a community
sample of older adolescents which found that 9.6 percent met DSM-IIIR criteria
for a current disorder and more than 33 percent had experienced a disorder over
their lifetimes.  The results indicate that the number of high school students
who become depressed during a 1 year period is high, such that in a
hypothetical high school of 1,000 students, approximately 74 cases of major
depression would be expected to occur during the year.  In further analyses of
the adolescent sample along with three samples of adults, the prevalence of
major depression has been increasing in recent birth cohorts.  Furthermore, an
early onset prior to age 25 tended to be associated with relapse.  Such
findings underscore the urgent need for epidemiologic information concerning
the prevalence, incidence, and associated risk factors for child and adolescent
mental disorders.  The recently funded UNO-CAP study should provide the
first-ever reliable national data concerning these major questions.  <p>
	  Substantial development in the field of child and adolescent
psychopharmacology is needed.  The number of funded psychopharmacologic studies
has grown modestly from 9 to 16 between 1987 and 1993, including a 3-site
multicenter study of lithium in adolescent bipolar disorder.  There continue to
be a number of significant difficulties, however, in developing pharmacologic
research in children and adolescents.  A major problem concerns the failure of
pharmaceutical companies, NIMH or others to fund research focused on the safety
and efficacy of potentially useful psychotropic medications in the pediatric
age range.  This is an important public health concern because despite the lack
of safety and efficacy data, there are millions of prescriptions written each
year for children and adolescents.  While some of this use is for Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) "approved" indications, most of these prescriptions are
for "off label" indications.  This failure is scandalous and encourages poor
medical practice.  The fact that many children appear to benefit from the use
of psychoactive medications places parents and prescribing physicians in a
dilemma as to the best course of action for specific children suffering from
severe childhood mental or emotional disabilities.  NIMH is to be commended for
its initiatives in bringing together representatives from the FDA, the Office
of Protection from Research Risks, representatives from the pharmaceutical
industry, child psychopharmacology researchers, and the lay community to enlist
their help in addressing these issues.  Partly as a result of consultative
meetings, some encouraging signs of change have been observed.  FDA has begun
to request pharmaceutical companies seeking new clinical indications for adult
populations to examine the safety and efficacy of these medications in children
and adolescents during "Phase IV" trials.  Continued efforts in this area are
essential.<p>
	  Somewhat greater growth has occurred in the area of psychosocial treatments,
where the number of grants has increased from 10 to 20, 1987 through 1993.
This area shows real promise, as investigators are now beginning to adapt
cognitive behavioral treatments (CBT) developed initially for adult populations
to adolescents.  Findings are preliminary, but early evidence indicates that
CBT is an effective treatment for adolescent major depressive disorder.
Likewise, investigators have modified Interpersonal Therapy for use in
adolescents, and clinical trials are underway with groups of depressed
adolescents.<p>
	  Another important indicator of the growth of treatment research has been the
increased number of research studies testing the efficacy of combined
pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments.  The number of funded studies in
this area is currently 9, compared to 0 in 1987.  A major initiative in this
area, the 6-site multimodal treatment Study of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder, is the most complex and sophisticated treatment study undertaken to
date by NIMH, incorporating recent advances in theory, method, and design in
order to address major questions of relevance to national health care reform
and to practitioners' "real world" treatment concerns.  Importantly, this study
is co-funded by the Department of Education.  Similar studies are needed in
adolescent depression and obsessive compulsive disorder.<p>
	  Advances in the area of in vivo neuroimaging hold promise for researchers
focused on the neurobiological origins of many childhood disorders including
schizophrenia, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette's
syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder, and specific mental retardation
syndromes, among others.  At present, 3-dimensional volumetric measurements of
subcortical structures and ventricular spaces using non-invasive magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) have been the most extensively utilized.  Ligand-based
single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and positron emission
tomography (PET) have gained some measure of acceptance in adolescent
populations despite their reliance on radioactive tracers.  The most promising
technological developments have been in the area of functional MRI and its
remarkable temporal and spatial resolution.  These non-invasive functional
imaging techniques will be powerful tools to study aspects of normal
development as well as psychopathological states.  <p>
	  NIMH has a broad program of theory-driven prevention research in the child
and adolescent area which recognizes that multiple outcomes can arise from
single risk factors and single outcomes can arise from multiple risk factors,
across multiple domains.  Prevention research funded by NIMH depends heavily on
understanding the development and distribution of psychopathology and is thus
closely tied to advances in basic, clinical, and epidemiological research.
Currently, 83 percent of the funds and 57 percent of the grants in the
Prevention Research Branch portfolio are focused on children and adolescents.<p>
	  The four years since the issuance of the IOM report on child and adolescent
mental disorders have seen a four-fold expansion in the area of prevention
research.  Major accomplishments incude the creation of a new Preventive
Intervention Research Center focused on the prevention of conduct disorder and
related problems; the development of new multi-site, multi-faceted population
based prevention trials focused on two areas: youth suicide and serious conduct
problems; and the emergence of empirical studies demonstrating the
cost-effectiveness of some efficacious preventive intervention strategies.  In
addition to the earlier IOM report, two more recent reports have also reviewed
the field of prevention research.  They include the NIMH Prevention Steering
Committee Report entitled The Prevention of Mental Disorders: A National
Research Agenda; and a congressionally mandated Institute of Medicine Report
entitled, Reducing Risks for Mental Disorders: Frontiers for Preventive
Intervention Research.  These reports have major implications for the future
directions of prevention research involving children, adolescents and their
families. Additional funds are needed to implement these initiatives.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Intramural Research</b><p>
<b>	</b>The NIMH Intramural Research Programs have shown an 121 percent growth
in funding from FY 1987 to FY 1993.  In constant 1987 dollars, this actually
represents a nine percent decrease in funding.  In the third year of the
National Plan (FY 1993) the projected level of support was $18 million and the
actual level of support was $5.1 million.  This level of funding is just 28
percent of the target (Figure 2).   <p>
	Specific points include:<p>
	  The Intramural program has a rich history of scientific accomplishment and a
unique set of studies not easily duplicated elsewhere.  These studies span
clinical research (genetics, neurochemistry, neuroimmunology, neuroimaging, and
treatment) with difficult-to-study populations, basic research, epidemiology
and prevention.  Examples include studies of children with autism,
childhood-onset schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
affective disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and Tourette's syndrome.
<p>
	  Rather than expanding the number of child-focused intramural programs from
two to three as recommended in the National Plan, it appears that NIMH is on
the verge of decreasing the number from two to just one (following the
anticipated retirement of a senior laboratory director in the near future). <p>
	  The NIMH Intramural Program is under enormous pressure to reduce its overall
budget. Despite efforts to lessen the impact of these cuts on senior scientists
(GS-14 and above), the resulting salary caps, hiring freeze, and actual layoffs
have had a devastating impact on morale throughout the Intramural Program.
This austerity has affected virtually every laboratory at the NIMH, but the
child and adolescent program has been particularly hard hit with the phasing
out of an entire program of research. <p>
	  In other respects, this crisis has been met with creativity and much-needed
reforms.  The creation of consortia of investigators focused on child and
adolescent disorders is sensible and long overdue.  The formation of
multidisciplinary groups is appropriate, and the inclusion of investigators
with expertise in psychosocial and developmental perspectives can only
strengthen this scientific effort.  The anticipated reduction in support,
however, of the intramural scientific program at NIMH with regard to child and
adolescent mental disorders is shortsighted and wholly inconsistent with the
spirit and letter of the National Plan.  These programs require a fair share of
the available resources.  <p>
	  The Intramural programs remain a premiere site for research training and
career development, although their status in this regard has been jeopardized
by below-par financial incentives and by the poor morale in the
clinically-oriented intramural research programs of NIMH generally.<p>
<p>
<b>Services Research</b><p>
<b></b>	Services research has shown a 756 percent increase in funding (or a 567
percent increase after adjusting for the effects of inflation) from FY 1987 to
FY 1993.  In the third year of the National Plan (FY 1993) the projected level
of support was $20 million and the actual level of support was $11 million.
This level of funding is 54 percent of the target (Figure 2).  As detailed
below, three Center grants (P50s) are currently funded, and a major national
initiative is well underway.  As in other research areas, funding for research
training and career development has been tallied separately (see above).
Specific points include:<p>
	  Service system integration models are being studied at the local county and
state level.  These projects are investigating community-based service system
models and linking these integrated programs with family and child outcomes.
Private foundations working in conjunction with NIMH and the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), such as the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation Mental Health Services for Youth program, have also taken
the lead in this area. <p>
	  Service utilization studies include examination of the types of services
used by children and families across the major service sectors.  For example,
researchers in North Carolina are examining service use by adolescents with
mental and addictive disorders in a rural area of southern Appalachia,
including 11 counties of western North Carolina.  The goal of the study is to
describe service use and to examine how the amount of service use (type of
care, restrictiveness, intensity and duration) is influenced over time by the
interaction of disease comorbidity with individual, family, and community
factors.  Preliminary results indicate that the strongest predictor of service
use among adolescents with severe mental disorders is the ability of family
members to mobilize resources to care for their child.<p>
	  Service utilization by minority adolescents has been recently examined,
revealing that African American adolescents are more likely than whites to be
referred by an external agency for mental health services.  African Americans
entered community mental health care more often than whites through referrals
from social agencies, whereas Mexican Americans entered more often than whites
through school referrals.  The implications of this study are that African
American adolescents may be over represented in community mental health clinics
because of their disproportionate contact with social and legal agencies.<p>
	  Other investigators are studying mental health care utilization among
children in foster care, an area of research that has long been neglected.
These studies, while still in progress, have generated preliminary data
indicating that the proportion of children receiving services both before and
after entry into foster care is higher than expected.  As these studies
progress, new data are expected to document the impact of services on long term
outcome.<p>
	  Controlled studies of service effectiveness are still rare.  Recent
meta-analyses have found consistent evidence of the positive effects of
psychotherapy from carefully controlled laboratory studies with children and
adolescents, but similar analyses of the effect of therapy using clinic samples
in non-research settings have shown weaker or even negative effects.  The
reasons for these discrepant findings are not clear, but such findings suggest
the need to bridge the gap between the laboratory and the clinic, and to
conduct research that is targeted for use in "real world" practice settings.<p>
	  Despite these advances, many research questions have not been studied.  Such
investigations could contribute to the formulation of public policies, such as
the current debate on health care reform.  Areas where knowledge is greatly
needed include: the effectiveness of services provided by the educational,
foster care, and juvenile justice systems; comparative studies of
community-based services versus residential treatment or hospital-based
services; the effectiveness of services used by minority children and families;
the impact of more direct parental involvement in treatment, service delivery
planning, and service system design; and studies of alternative treatments and
services, such as family preservation, therapeutic foster care, or wrap-around
services using flexible funding. There is also a need to examine the effects of
cost containment strategies on the delivery of children's mental health
services. The impact of alternative reimbursement and funding strategies within
both the public and private sectors also needs to be evaluated.<p>
	  The recently funded UNO-CAP study should address some of these gaps in our
knowledge.  Specifically, this study involves a systematic study of children's
mental health needs and services based on a representative national sample of
children, as well as a more in depth examination service needs and utilization
in four regions across the country (Los Angeles, Baltimore, St. Louis, and
North Carolina).  Results of this study will help delineate the extent of unmet
need for mental health services in this country (including the prevalence and
incidence of child and adolescent psychopathology at local and national
levels), the patterns of service use provided across the major service sectors,
and the barriers families face in accessing services.  Furthermore, it will
supply information on the socioeconomic, ethnic, family, community, and service
system characteristics that influence entry into one or more service sectors;
the clinical, developmental, functional, and service-related outcomes for
children and adolescents who do and do not receive care; and the costs of care.
The chance to follow longitudinally a national sample of 7,000 children, aged 4
to 17, provides unprecedented research opportunities to examine a range of
putative risk and protective factors.  Funding for the UNO-CAP study began in
September 1994.	<p>
	  Another future effort concerns the expansion of coordinated efforts with
other federal agencies.  Given the continued interest in comprehensive,
integrated services for children, joint activities are planned to coordinate
the child and adolescent services research program with major initiatives
emanating from the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), a component of
SAMHSA.  Through a joint program announcement, this CMHS/NIMH combined effort
will encourage investigators to refine the models of integrated service
delivery for children and adolescents, while incorporating effectiveness and
outcome studies into the overall interventions.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Dissemination and Advocacy</b><p>
	The National Plan called for the allocation of funds ($0.3 million to $1.3
million) to support the dissemination of scientific knowledge in the area of
child and adolescent mental disorders.  Although many programs and initiatives
could be identified as being in response to this mandate, it is clear that NIMH
has not yet realized the opportunity to engage CMHS and other interested lay
and professional organizations in a well-organized effort to inform the public
concerning the magnitude and consequences of child and adolescent mental
disorders and convey in appropriate media settings the results of empirical
research and the need to take advantage of advances in related scientific
disciplines.  Given the motivation and resources of such organizations as the
National Alliance for the Mentally Ill and its Children and Adolescent Network,
the National Mental Health Association, the Federation of Families for Child
Mental Health Services, the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and
Affective Disorders, the National Depression and Manic Depressive Association,
the Tourette Syndrome Association, the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
Foundation, and others, much more could be done.  NIMH has a unique ability to
convene these organizations and develop joint funding mechanisms to provide an
impetus for concerned lay and professional organizations to work together to
educate and inform both the practitioners and the public. The NIMH's initiative
to increase the public's awareness of the signs and symptoms of depression and
the availability of safe and efficacious treatments could serve as a useful
model.4-6     <p>
  	<b></b><p>
<b>Leadership</b> <p>
	By 1990, the leadership of NIMH had developed a broad range of strategies to
implement the National Plan.  As recommended in the original IOM report, an
institute-wide Consortium for Research in Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders
was established.  A major goal of this consortium was to unify the field and
provide national leadership for the many NIMH research activities related to
children and adolescents. Specific strategies adopted by the Consortium have
included:<p>
	  The development of new program announcements in specific, high priority
research areas.  Many of these initiatives are reflected in the range of basic,
epidemiological, clinical, prevention, and services research documented above
including the MECA, UNO-CAP, and the six site multimodal treatment study of
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder described above. <p>
	  Creation of a new initial research review committee.  The Childhood
Psychopathology and Treatment committee convened for the first time in March
1992.  This committee has had a substantial number of proposals to review (40
to 55) in each subsequent grant cycle.  <p>
 	  Coordination of research initiatives in collaboration with other NIH
institutes and government agencies. Specifically, contacts have begun with
NICHD, NINDS, SAMHSA, and the Department of Education to explore joint research
approaches and collaboration funding strategies to address high priority
areas.<p>
	  Developing funding partnerships with foundations.  For example, the Child
Consortium has begun collaborating with several major foundations (W.T. Grant
and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundations) to consider mechanisms
whereby private and public sources of funding can collaborate to develop the
much-needed research in the child and adolescent mental disorders areas.
Preliminary work in this regard has led one foundation to sponsor and fund two
Developmental Child Centers in early FY 1992.  NIMH will employ similar efforts
to link and coordinate branches of the federal government with complimentary
interests in this area.<p>
	  Collaborating with SAMHSA, as well as with advocacy and professional
organizations, in jointly sponsored workshops, conferences, and other
initiatives to support the dissemination of relevant research findings.
Although there has been some activity in this area, much more needs to be done
by way of public education and dissemination of research findings. <p>
	  Shaping the research field through convening groups of journal editors,
scientists, and theorists to foster sharing of alternative paradigms and
research approaches. Specifically, the Child Consortium has initiated an annual
meeting with leading journal editors in the child and adolescent mental
disorders field and related areas of developmental psychology, pharmacology,
and sociology (the so-called "Editors' Consortium").  The goal of this meeting
(now in its fourth year) has been to facilitate research dissemination to
practitioners, and to cultivate interdisciplinary collaboration and the
examination of research paradigms within and across disciplines.  It is
anticipated that the Editors' Consortium will eventually secure its own grant
(possibly through NIMH) for more permanent funding arrangements.  This meeting
is co-chaired by John F. McDermott, Jr., Editor of the Journal of the American
Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Richard M. Lerner, Editor of the
Journal of Adolescence.<p>
	  Stimulating research through regular letters about upcoming Consortium
initiatives, recently funded research, and training opportunities. For example,
a range of other activities are in progress, including workshops and national
conferences on issues related to mental health in ethnic and minority
populations, ethical issues concerning research with children, and assessment
of mental health and mental disorders in young children.  These conferences
facilitate research dissemination, interdisciplinary collaboration and the
examination of research paradigms within and across disciplines, and advance
knowledge in critical, understudied areas.<p>
	A major challenge to the viability and effectiveness of the National Plan is
and will be the impact of leadership changes at NIMH (there have been two
Directors and two Acting-Directors at NIMH since the inception of the Plan) and
adjustments that will be necessary with the re-integration of NIMH within the
NIH.  The Consortium and its Chair, Peter Jensen, have played an essential and
vital role in moving ahead the recommendations of the IOM report.  Its
continued health will be essential for the success of the National Plan and in
formulating the next phase of development as this scientific field matures.<p>
<p>
<b>A Priority Area--For Our Children, Families, and Our Future</b><p>
<b></b>	The scientific community has repeatedly identified research on child
and adolescent mental disorders as a priority area for increased funding.  A
strong argument can be made that, given the long-term impact of child and
adolescent mental disorders, anything short of the level of funding called for
the National Plan would be unwise.2  In some instances, such as autistic
disorder the impact is obvious, devastating, and life long. Other conditions
such as prepubertal major depression are associated with significant levels of
morbidity and mortality.  For many other conditions, including mood and anxiety
disorders, affected children and adolescents are at increased risk to develop
adult mental disorders, while a significant proportion of children and
adolescents diagnosed with conduct disorder will enter the criminal justice
system. As a result, it is appropriate to include not only the direct costs to
families and society associated with these disorders but also a portion of the
costs associated with adult psychiatric morbidity and mortality (decreased
productivity in the work place, the need for social welfare supports) and
criminal outcomes, in order to measure the true cost to society of child and
adolescent mental disorders.<p>
	This argument is further strengthened by an examination of the declining
indicators of the status of children in this country: the high rate (greater
than 20 percent) of children living in poverty,7 increasing rates of child
maltreatment,8 the high rate of school drop out9 and teenage pregnancy,10 the
increasing violence of urban youth culture,11 and the knowledge that these risk
factors are and will be associated with increasing rates of child and
adolescent mental disorders. These figures emphasize that it is time to invest
fully in our children, if we care about the our future.   <p>
	Alternatively, the promising advances in related fields of genetics and the
developmental neurosciences suggest that this is an especially propitious time
to invest in research on the biological determinants of child and adolescent
mental disorders.  Indeed, there is compelling evidence that the mechanisms
responsible for some adult onset disorders such as schizophrenia and
Alzheimer's disease involve abnormalities in early brain development.  <p>
	The argument can also be made that this field of research has been chronically
underfunded.  Using the demographic yardstick, in 1990, there were 65 million
children and adolescents under the age of 18, or 26 percent of the total US
population of 253 million.12  In contrast, the proportion of NIMH's total
research budget that has been allocated to child and adolescent mental
disorders has been consistently less over the past seven years: FY 1987 (19 to
22 percent); FY 1988 (17 to 20 percent); FY 1989 (19 to 22 percent); FY 1990
(19 to 24 percent); FY 1991 (19 to 23 percent); FY 1992 (19 to 23 percent); and
FY 1993 (19 to 23 percent).  Depending on the year, the shortfall between the
actual funding versus what might be expected using the demographic yardstick of
26 percent of the total research budget ranges between 15 and 38 million
dollars per year for each of the past seven years.    <p>
	Now is a critically important time for the federal government to invest in our
families.  Advances in clinical, prevention, and services research have had and
will continue to have direct benefit to families.  The provision of
state-of-the-art services tailored to local and regional needs is an important
priority which must be supported by basic and clinical research at the
frontiers of scientific inquiry.<p>
<p>
<b>Conclusions</b><p>
<b></b>	Overall NIMH's Report Card on the National Plan is mixed, with some
components nearly fully realized and others scarcely addressed. <p>
	1. The National Plan for Research on Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders
announced in 1990 has had a discernable impact on the level of funding for this
area.  Greatest gains have occurred in services research and prevention
programs.  NIMH is to be commended for moving ahead with the UNO-CAP study,
which will provide for the first time national prevalence, service, and needs
assessment data for child and adolescent mental disorders.  Other bright spots
include the multisite trial of combined cognitive-behavioral and
pharmacological treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. On the
whole, clinical research has fared better than basic research. <p>
	2. The formation of the Institute-wide consortium has provided essential
leadership for the implementation of the Plan. The creation of an initial
review committee devoted to assessing the scientific merit of grant proposals
in this area has also had a major positive impact.  Care is need to preserve
these gains, given leadership changes at NIMH and the re-integration of the
Institute into the larger NIH structure.<p>
	3. Gains in the funding of research for child and adolescent mental disorders
have been commensurate with an overall increase in NIMH's total research
budget.  The proportion of research funds (19 to 23 percent) directed towards
child and adolescent mental disorders has not changed during the past seven
years. These figure falls short of what was called for as part of the National
Plan and do not reflect the priority that research in this area should receive
nor do they meet a more basic standard of fairness given that 26 percent of the
US population is under 18 years of age.<p>
	4. Investment in research training and career development has been modest, and
many excellent career development proposals have not been funded. This is a
critical issue if the capacity-building aspects of the National Plan are to be
realized.<p>
	5. The Intramural NIMH Programs focused on Child and Adolescent Mental
Disorders are in crisis and are absorbing a disproportionate share of the cuts
in funding.  One of the two existing programs is being phased out.  Innovative
efforts are underway to diminish the adverse impact and improve morale, but
valuable national resources that have been premier sites for scientific
progress and research training are at risk. <p>
	6. A major shortcoming in the implementation of the National Plan has been the
failure of NIMH to facilitate dissemination of knowledge concerning child and
adolescent mental disorders and their treatment.   Concerted and united efforts
of many public and private organizations are needed to educate all segments of
society - both lay and professional - concerning the latest knowledge
concerning these devastating conditions and what can be done to prevent and
treat them.  A national program like that undertaken to educate and disseminate
knowledge concerning the depression and other major affective disorders is
needed.<p>
	7. Research on child and adolescent mental disorders remains a priority area
in need of greater funding.  Our Nation continues to waste needlessly its most
precious natural resource: our children and youth.  We are permitting more than
12 percent of our children and adolescents - 7.5 million young Americans - to
suffer from mental disorders, often for life.  And we are doing far too little
to develop the scientific knowledge needed to treat or prevent their illness or
lessen its enormous human and financial costs.  In the mid-1990s, in a time of
increasingly scarce resources for research, what is the appropriate yardstick
to judge the fairness of resource allocation?  A strong argument can be made
that, given the long-term impact of child and adolescent mental disorders, it
is essential for NIH and other funding agencies in both the public and private
sectors to identify this as a priority area in need of greater funding.  It is
time to <b>invest fully</b> in our children if we care about their future and
the future of our society.<p>

<H1>RESPONDING TO CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE</H1>
 
	When a child tells an adult that he or she has been sexually abused, the adult may feel uncomfortable and may not know what to say or do.  The following guidelines are for responding to children who have been sexually abused: 
<H4>	What to Say</H4>
<UL>
<LI>If a child even hints in a vague way that sexual abuse has occurred, encourage him or her to talk freely.  Don't make judgmental comments.  
<LI>Show that you understand and take seriously what the child is saying.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists have found that children who are listened to and understood fare much better than those who are not.  The response to the disclosure of sexual abuse is critical to the child's ability to resolve the trauma of sexual abuse.  
<LI> Assure the child that he or she did the right thing in telling.  A child who is close to the abuser may feel guilty about revealing the secret.  The child may feel frightened if the abuser has threatened to harm the child or other family members as punishment for telling the secret.  
<LI>Tell the child that he or she is not to blame for the sexual abuse.  Most children in attempting to make sense out of the abuse will believe that somehow they caused it or may even view it as a form of punishment for imagined or real wrongdoings.  
<LI>Finally, offer the child protection, and promise that you will promptly take steps to see that the abuse stops.
</UL>

<H4>What to Do</H4> 
	Report any suspicion of child abuse.  If the abuse is within the family, report it to the local Child Protection Agency.  If the abuse is outside of the family, report it to the police or district attorney's office.  Individuals reporting in good faith are immune from prosecution.  The agency receiving the report will conduct an evaluation and will take action to protect the child. <P>

	Parents should consult with their pediatrician or family physician, who may refer them to a physician who specializes in evaluating and treating sexual abuse.  The examining doctor will evaluate the child's condition and treat any physical problem related to the abuse, gather evidence to help protect the child, and reassure the child that he or she is all right. <P>

	Usually, the child should also have a psychiatric evaluation to find out how the sexual abuse has affected him or her, and to determine whether ongoing professional help is necessary for the child to deal with the trauma of the abuse.  The child and adolescent psychiatrist can also provide support to other family members who may be upset by the abuse. <P>

	While most allegations of sexual abuse made by children are true, some false accusations may arise in custody disputes and in other situations.  Occasionally, the court will ask a child and adolescent psychiatrist to help determine whether the child is telling the truth, or whether it will hurt the child to speak in court about the abuse. <P>

	When a child is asked as to testify, special considerations--such as videotaping, frequent breaks, exclusion of spectators, and the option not to look at the accused--make the experience much less stressful. <P>

	Adults, because of their maturity and knowledge, are always the ones to blame when they abuse children.  The abused children should never be blamed. <P>

	When a child tells someone about sexual abuse, a supportive, caring response is the first step towards getting help for the child, reestablishing his or her trust in adults.<P>

<H1>MANEJO DE ABUSO SEXUAL EN LOS NISOS</H1>
<P>Los adultos suelen sentirse inc&oacute;modos y no saben que hacer o decir cuando un menor le cuenta que ha sido molestado(a). A continuaci&oacute;n presentamos varias ideas que pueden ser &uacute;tiles en responder a este tipo de situaci&oacute;n.

<H4>Qu&eacute; decir</H4>

<UL>
<LI>Si un ni&ntilde;o(a) insin&uacute;a, aunque vagamente, que ha ocurrido abuso sexual ali&eacute;ntelo a que siga hablando del tema libremente. No pase juicio sobre la informaci&oacute;n
<LI>Demu&eacute;strele que entiende y toma en serio lo que el ni&ntilde;o(a) dice. Los Psiquiatras de Ni&ntilde;os y Adolescentes encuentran que aquellos ni&ntilde;os a quienes se les presta atenci&oacute;n y se les comprende cuando tienen algo que comunicar, tienen mejor pron&oacute;stico que los que no se atienden. La reacci&oacute;n de la lzersona al relato es de suma importancia para que el ni&ntilde;o pueda llegar a resolver el trauma causado por el abuso sexual.
<LI>Asegure al ni&ntilde;o que &eacute;l actu&oacute; correctamente al hablarle del incidente. Un ni&ntilde;o que tiene una relaci&oacute;n cercana con el abusador puede sentirse cul!zable por revelar el secreto. Tambi&eacute;n puede sentir temor si el abusador lo amenaz&oacute; con hacerle da&ntilde;o a &eacute;l o a otros miembros de la familia como castigo por haber revelado el secreto.
<LI>D&iacute;gale al menor que el(ella) no es culpable del abuso. Muchos ni&ntilde;os, al tratar de explicarse el abuso, creen que en alguna forma ellos fueron responsables; o pueden ver el abuso como una forma de castigo por faltas imaginarias o reales que &quot;ellos han cometido&quot;.
<LI>Finalmente, ofrezca protecci&oacute;n al menor a la vez que le promete que tomara medidas para asegurar que el abuso termine.

<H1>CHILD ABUSE - THE HIDDEN BRUISES</H1>

	The statistics on physical child abuse are alarming.  Of the estimated hundreds of thousands of children battered each year by a parent or close relative, thousands die.  For those who survive, the emotional trauma remains long after the external bruises have healed. Communities and the courts recognize that these emotional "hidden bruises" can be treated.<P>
	Often the severe emotional damage to abused children does not surface until adolescence or later, when many abused children become abusing parents.  An adult who was abused as a child has trouble establishing intimate personal relationships, with a tendency to see all other adults as potential abusers.  These men and women "cannot stand to be touched."  Without proper treatment, they can be damaged for life.<P>
	Children who have been abused may display:
<UL>
<LI>A poor self-image;
<LI>Inability to depend on, trust or love others;
<LI>Aggressive and disruptive--sometimes illegal--behavior;
<LI>Passive and withdrawn behavior; fear of entering into new relationships or activities;
<LI>School failure;
<LI>Serious drug and alcohol abuse.
</UL>	
The child and adolescent psychiatrist is able to treat the "whole child"--medical as well as psychological or emotional problems that have occurred as a result of the abuse.  The family can be helped to learn new ways of support and communicating with one another. Through treatment, the abused child begins to regain a sense of self-confidence and trust.<P>
	Battering is not the only kind of child abuse.  Many children are victims of neglect, or sexual or emotional abuse.  In all kinds of child abuse, the child and the family can benefit from the comprehensive evaluation and care of a child and adolescent psychiatrist.<P>

<H1>CHILDREN & TV VIOLENCE</H1> 
	American children watch an average of three to fours hours of television daily.  Television can be a powerful influence in developing value systems and shaping behavior.  Unfortunately, much of today's television programming is violent.  Hundreds of studies of the effects of TV violence on children and teenagers have found that children may:
<UL>
<LI>Become "immune" to the horror of violence;
<LI>Gradually accept violence as a way to solve problems;
<LI>Imitate the violence they observe on television; and
<LI>Identify with certain characters, victims and/or victimizers:
</UL>
	Extensive viewing of television violence by children causes greater aggressiveness.  Sometimes, watching a single violent program can increase aggressiveness.  Children who view shows in which violence is very realistic, frequently repeated or unpunished, are more likely to imitate what they see.  The impact of TV violence may be immediately evident in the child's behavior or may surface years later, and young people can even be affected when the family atmosphere shows no tendency toward violence.<P>

	This does not mean that violence on television is the only source for aggressive or violent behavior, but it is a significant contributor.<P>

	Parents can protect children from excessive TV violence in the following ways:
<UL>
<LI>Pay attention to the programs their children are watching.  Watch some with them. 
<LI>Set limits on the amount of time they spend with the television. 
<LI>Point out that although the actor has not actually been hurt or killed, such violence in real life results in pain or death. 
<LI>Refuse to let the children see shows known to be violent, and change the channel or turn off the TV set when something offensive comes on, with an explanation of what is wrong with the program.
<LI>Disapprove of the violent episodes in front of the children, stressing the belief that such behavior is not the best way to resolve a problem. 
<LI>To offset peer pressure among friends and classmates, contact other    parents and agree to enforce similar rules about the length of time and type of program the children may watch. 
</UL>
	Parents should also use these measures to prevent harmful effects from television in other areas such as racial or sexual stereotyping.  The amount of time children watch TV, regardless of content, should be moderated, because it keeps children from other, more beneficial activities such as reading and playing with friends.  If parents have serious difficulties setting limits, or deep concerns about how their child is reacting to television, they should contact a child and adolescent psychiatrist for help defining the problem.<P>

<H1>QUESTIONS TO ASK ABOUT PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS</H1>

	Medication may be an important part of treatment for some psychiatricdisorders in children and adolescents.  Psychiatric medication should only be used asone part of a comprehensive treatment plan.  Ongoing evaluation and monitoring by aphysician is essential.  Parents should be provided with complete information whenpsychiatric medication is recommended as part of their child's treatment plan. Children and adolescents should be included in the discussion about medications,using words they understand.  By asking the following questions, children,adolescents, and their parents will gain a better understanding of psychiatricmedications:
<OL>
<LI>What is the name of the medication?  Is it known by other names?
<LI>What is known about its helpfulness with other children who have a   similar condition to my child?
<LI>How will the medication help my child?  How long before I see   improvement?  When will it work?
<LI>What are the side effects which commonly occur with this    medication?
<LI>What are the rare or serious side effects, if any, which can occur?
<LI>Is this medication addictive?  Can it be abused?
<LI>What is the recommended dosage?  How often will the medication    be taken?
<LI>Are there any laboratory tests (e.g. heart tests, blood test, etc.) which   need to be done before my child begins taking the medication?  Will   any tests need to be done while my child is taking the medication?
<LI>Will a child and adolescent psychiatrist be monitoring my child's   response to medication and make dosage changes if necessary?  How   often will progress be checked and by whom?
<LI>Are there any other medications or foods which my child should avoid   while taking the medication?
<LI>Are there any activities that my child should avoid while taking the medication?  Are any precautions recommended for other activities?
<LI>How long will my child need to take this medication?  How will the decision be made to stop this medication?
<LI>What do I do if a problem develops (e.g. if my child becomes ill, doses are missed, or side effects develop)?
<LI>What is the cost of the medication (generic vs. brand name)?
<LI>Does my child's school nurse need to be informed about this medication?
</OL>

	Treatment with psychiatric medications is a serious matter for parents, children and adolescents.  Parents should ask these questions before their child or adolescent starts taking psychiatric medications.  Parents and children/adolescents need to be fully informed about medications.  If, after asking these questions, parents still have serious questions or doubts about medication treatment, they should feel free to ask for a second opinion by a child and adolescent psychiatrist.  Parents seeking a referral for any reason to a local child and adolescent psychiatrist may contact the AACAP, 3615 Wisconsin Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C.  20016, (202) 966-7300. <P>

<H1>HELPING CHILDREN AFTER A DISASTER</H1> 

	A catastrophe such as an earthquake, hurricane, tornado, fire or flood is frightening to children and adults alike.  It is important to acknowledge the frightening parts of the disaster when talking with a child about it.  Falsely minimizing the danger will not end a child's concerns.  Several factors affect a child's response to a disaster.  <P>

	The way children see and understand their parents' response is very important.  Children are aware of their parents' worries most of the time but they are particularly sensitive during a crisis.  Parents should admit their concerns to their children, and also stress their abilities to cope with the situation. <P>

	A child's reaction also depends on how much destruction he or she sees during and after the disaster.  If a friend or family member has been killed or seriously injured, or if the child's school or home has been severely damaged, there is a greater chance that the child will experience difficulties. <P>

	A child's age affects how the child will respond to the disaster.  For example, six- year-olds may show their concerns about a catastrophe by refusing to attend school, whereas adolescents may minimize their concerns but argue more with parents and show a decline in school performance.  It is important to explain the event in words the child can understand. <P>

	Following a disaster, people may develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which is psychological damage that can result from experiencing, witnessing or participating in an overwhelmingly traumatic (frightening) event.  Children with this disorder have repeated episodes in which they re-experience the traumatic event.  Children often relive the trauma through repetitive play.  In young children, distressing dreams of the traumatic event may change into nightmares of monsters, of rescuing others or of threats to self or others. <P>

	PTSD rarely appears during the trauma itself.  Though its symptoms can occur soon after the event, the disorder often surfaces several months or even years later.   Parents should be alert to these changes:  
<UL>
<LI>Refusal to return to school and "clinging" behavior, shadowing the mother or fatheraround the house; 
<LI>Persistent fears related to the catastrophe (such as fears about being permanentlyseparated from parents); 
<LI>Sleep disturbances such as nightmares, screaming during sleep and bedwetting,persisting more than several days after the event; 
<LI>Loss of concentration and irritability; 
<LI>Behavior problems--for example, misbehaving in school or at home in ways thatare not typical for the child; 
<LI>Physical complaints (stomachaches, headaches, dizziness) for which a physicalcause cannot be found; 
<LI>Withdrawal from family and friends, listlessness, decreased activity, preoccupationwith the events of the disaster. 
</UL>

	Professional advice or treatment for children affected by a disaster--especially those who have witnessed destruction, injury or death--can help prevent or minimize PTSD.  Parents who are concerned about their children can ask their pediatrician or family doctor to refer them to a child and adolescent psychiatrist.<P>

<H1>HOME ALONE CHILDREN</H1>

	  Every day thousands of children arrive home from school to an empty house.  Every week thousands of parents make decisions to leave children home alone while they go to work, run errands, or for social engagements.  It is estimated over 40% of children are left home at some time - though rarely overnight.  In more extreme situations, some children spend so much time without their parent(s) that these children are labelled "latch key children" - referring to the house or apartment key strung visibly around their neck.<P>

	 The popular movie "Home Alone", and its sequel, have portrayed a child's survival skills in a very humorous, but unrealistic manner.  The realities facing children who find themselves home alone are very different.  There are many issues and potential risks and dangers that parent(s) should consider before a child is placed in this situation.  Parent(s) should consider the following:
<UL>
<LI>Age readiness
<LI>Definition of parental "rules and expectations"
<LI>How to access parent(s) or other adults (e.g. phone numbers)
<LI>Potentially unsafe situations (e.g. medical emergencies, fire, alcohol, drugs, strangers, guns, etc.)
<LI>When and how to answer the phone or doorbell
<LI>Use of phone
<LI>Friends and visitors coming to the house
<LI>Responsibilities for siblings
<LI>Use of unstructured time (e.g. watch TV, videos, etc.)
<LI>Access to "adult" cable TV
</UL>

	 It is not possible to make a general statement about when (at what age) a  child can be left home alone.  Older adolescents are usually responsible enough to manage alone for limited periods of time.  Parent(s) must consider the child's level of maturity and past evidence of responsible behavior and good judgement.  Time periods when parent(s) are absent should be limited.  Parent(s) must talk with their youngsters to prepare them to develop a plan that addresses each of the issues or potential problems listed above.  In addition, parent(s) should strive to make their home as safe as possible from obvious dangers and hazards and rehearse the developed "emergency plan" with their children. Being home alone can be a frightening and potentially dangerous situation for many children and adolescents.  Parents should strive to limit the times when children are home alone.  Parents should prepare their children in advance for how to deal with situations that may arise.<P>

<H1>11 QUESTIONS TO ASK BEFORE PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS</H1> 

	Treatment in a psychiatric hospital is one of a range of available options when a child or adolescent is mentally ill.  Parents are naturally concerned and may be frightened and confused when inpatient treatment is recommended for their child.  By asking the following questions, parents will gain a better understanding of the proposed stay in an inpatient facility: 
<OL>
<LI>Why is psychiatric inpatient treatment being recommended for our child, and how will it help our child?
<LI>What are the other treatment alternatives to hospital treatment, and how do they compare?  
<LI>Is a child and adolescent psychiatrist admitting our child to the hospital? 
<LI>What does the treatment program for inpatient treatment include, and how will our child be able to keep up with school work?  
<LI>What are the responsibilities of the child and adolescent psychiatrist and other people on the treatment team?  
<LI>How long will our child be in the hospital, and how do we pay for these services?  
<LI>What will happen if we can no longer afford to keep our children in this hospital, and inpatient treatment is still necessary?  
<LI>How will we as parents be involved in our child's hospitalization, including the decision for discharge and after-care treatment?  
<LI>Is this hospital approved by the Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) as a treatment facility for youngsters of our child's age, or will our child be on a specialized unit or in a program accedited for treatment for children and adolescents.  
<LI>How will the decision be made to discharge our child from the hospital?
<LI>Once our child is discharged, what are the plans for continuing or follow-up treatment? 
</OL>

	Hospital treatment is a serious matter for parents, children and adolescents.  Parents should raise these questions before their child or adolescent is admitted to the hospital.  Parents who are informed about the hospital's treatment plan and procedures can fully contribute to the effectiveness of their child's treatment. <P>

	If after asking the above questions, parents still have serious questions or doubts, they should feel free to ask for a second opinion.  Parents seeking a referral to a local child and adolescent psychiatrist may contact the AACAP, 3615 Wisconsin Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.  20016, (202) 966-7300.<P>

<H2><CENTER>Blood Pressure Drug May Help Preschoolers With Severe PTSD</CENTER></H2>

<P>

The blood pressure drug clonidine can help preschool-age children with severe posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms resulting from chronic abuse or neglect, reports a study in the
September issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.<p>

<p>

Child and adolescent psychiatrists, Robert J. Harmon, M.D. and Paula D. Riggs, M.D. of the
University of Colorado, tried clonidine in seven preschool-age children, three to six years old,
with severe posttraumatic symptoms that did not respond to other treatments.  The study found
that clonidine did lead to great improvements in many of the major symptoms of PTSD. 
Aggressive behavior lessened in all of the children, and most had fewer problems with impulsive
behavior, over-alertness, emotional outbursts and mood swings, anxiety, disobedience and
"oppositional" behavior, sleeplessness, and nightmares.  While taking clonidine, the children got
along better with other patients and the staff at the day hospital where they were being treated.  <p>

<p>

Symptoms of PTSD develop in adults and children exposed to psychologically traumatic events
such as war, violence, or - in the case of the very young children in the new study - chronic abuse
or neglect.  Clonidine has been helpful in adults with PTSD, prompting Drs. Harmon and Riggs to
try it in children.<p>

<p>

Clonidine had few major side effects, though abrupt blood pressure increases were possible if
treatment stopped suddenly.  Most of the children used a clonidine patch that released the drug in
small amounts throughout the day.	<p>

<p>

Many children were not well enough to benefit from psychotherapy and other non-drug
treatments for PTSD until they started taking clonidine.  Drugs are not the first treatment choice
for PTSD in children, Drs. Harmon and Riggs emphasize.  However, for very young children with
severe posttraumatic symptoms that do not respond to other treatments, clonidine may offer the
best chance of improvement.  Clonidine's true effectiveness can only be determined through
larger, scientifically controlled studies.<p>

<H2><CENTER>Risk Factors for Child Psychiatric Emergencies Identified<BR>
</CENTER></H2>

<P>

An analysis of psychiatric emergencies in children and adolescents suggests that suicidal
youngsters are more likely to be older girls, while those with aggressive or defiant disorders are
more likely to be younger boys, according to a study in the September issue of the Journal of the
American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.<p>

<p>

Researchers, led by child and adolescent psychiatrist Bradley S. Peterson, M.D. of the Yale Child
Study Center, analyzed 1,436 patients under sixteen years old who came to the Yale Child Study
Center's psychiatric emergency room over a 10-year period.  When they broke the types of
emergencies down into broad categories, the researchers found that patients with suicidal
thoughts or attempted suicide were more likely to be female and older in age, whereas patients
with "oppositional-defiant" or aggressive disorders tended to be male and younger in age.<p>

<p>

Suicidal patients were more likely to come to the emergency department on weekdays or during
the school year, suggesting that problems at school may precipitate suicidal thoughts and actions. 
In contrast, children with aggressive and defiant disorders were more likely to have their crises on
the weekends or during school vacations, suggesting a link to trouble at home.<p>

<p>

During the school year, patients seen were more likely to be admitted to the psychiatric hospital. 
Patients who were hospitalized during their initial crises were less likely to return to the
emergency room because of suicidal thoughts or actions.  These results suggest that earlier
treatment could reduce future problems for children and teens in crisis, though this remains to be
proven.  The findings will help doctors to identify young patients who need special evaluation for
suicidal or aggressive disorders.  <p>

	<p>

The new research is part of ongoing efforts by child and adolescent psychiatrists to understand
and manage the growing epidemic of behavioral disturbances among young people, especially in
urban areas.  As rates of antisocial behavior, crime, and suicide increase, having information on
specific risk factors may help to predict dangerous behaviors.  Awareness of the risk factors will
help in assessing young patients with psychiatric emergencies and in ensuring that they receive the
best treatment for their specific problem.

<H2><CENTER>Kids' Asthma Perceptions Affect Disease Control
</CENTER></H2>

<P>
Children who perceive their asthma symptoms accurately are more
likely to have their disease under good control and less likely
to have it interfere with their everyday lives, according to a
study in the August issue of the<I> Journal of the American Academy
of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</I>.<BR>

<P>
 Children's perceptions of asthma are related to their intelligence
but apparently not to other psychological factors, reports child
and adolescent psychiatrist <B>Gregory K. Fritz, M.D.</B> of Brown
University, who led the new research<B>.<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Fritz and colleagues conducted an in-depth study of
86 children attending a New Hampshire asthma camp over three summers.
 Several times a day, the children performed objective lung function
tests and predicted what their results would be.  This gave the
researchers an indicator of how accurately the children perceived
their breathing function, which they compared against the results
of various psychological tests.<BR>

<P>
 The children's perceptions varied significantly---some predicted<B>
</B>their objective test results very well, while others consistently
underestimated or overestimated their breathing ability.  For
children whose asthma perceptions were more accurate, the disease
seemed to interfere less with everyday functioning, as reflected
by missed school days and trips to the emergency room for asthma
attacks.<BR>

<P>
 The preventative effects of accurate perceptions remained even
after statistical adjustment for the severity of asthma.  Asthma
was severe in 49 percent of the children studied, moderate in
35 percent, and mild in sixteen percent.<BR>

<P>
 Children who scored higher on an IQ test perceived their asthma
symptoms more accurately.  However, perceptual accuracy was unrelated to the
results of other psychological tests, such as tests of anxiety,
coping style, behavior patterns, or the parents' perceptions of
their symptoms.

<P>
 Especially surprising was the finding of children with a repressive
coping style---those who tended to ignore or deny their asthma
symptoms---may have had more accurate perceptions than children
with other coping styles.<BR>

<P>
 Though the accuracy of perceptions does influence some of the
consequences of asthma for children, other unidentified factors
are probably more important.  For example, the roles of allergy,
taking medication regularly, and other disease factors remain
to be determined.  Also important to study are the factors influencing
asthma control among African-American children, who seem particularly
likely to suffer adverse consequences of asthma.<BR>

<P>
 Efforts to reduce the negative effects of asthma focus on teaching
asthma patients about their disease and how they can control it
to keep it from interfering with their lives.  The accuracy of
perceptions plays an important part in this process, especially
in children.  The new research is an important first step in understanding
how children with asthma perceive their symptoms, and perhaps
in finding ways to improve those perceptions.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>1 in 4 ADHD Kids at Risk of Bipolar Disorder, Study
Finds<BR>
</CENTER></H2>

<P>
 Nearly one-quarter of children with attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) have or will develop bipolar disorder, sometimes
called manic-depression, according to a study in the August issue
of the<I> Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry</I>.<BR>

<P>
 Bipolar disorder accompanying ADHD is a real problem with potentially
serious consequences for the child, reports child and adolescent
psychiatrist <B>Joseph Biederman, M.D.</B> of Massachusetts General
Hospital.  The condition may be difficult to recognize because
it is different from bipolar disorder in adults.<BR>

<P>
 Over a four-year study, 23 percent of a group of 140 children
with ADHD studied also had bipolar disorder, compared with about
two percent of a group of normal children.  Eleven percent of
the ADHD children had bipolar disorder when they were initially
studied, and another twelve percent had bipolar disorder when
studied again 4 years later.<BR>

<P>
 The children with bipolar disorder were likely to be irritable
and hyperactive, with simultaneous or rapid cycling between mania
and depression.  The pattern is different from that in adults
with bipolar disorder, who are more likely to swing between periods
of euphoria and depression.  In addition, many children with bipolar
disorder had prolonged outbursts of aggression, sometimes called
&quot;affective storms.&quot;<BR>

<P>
 Children with bipolar disorder and ADHD had more additional problems
than those with ADHD alone.  They were more likely to develop
other psychiatric disorders such as depression or conduct disorders,
more likely to require psychiatric hospitalization, and more likely
to have social problems.  Their ADHD was also more severe than
in children without accompanying bipolar disorder.<BR>


<P>
 ADHD and bipolar disorder have some common characteristics, namely
distractibility, fidgetiness, and talkativeness.  However, careful
diagnostic analyses showed that the link between the two disorders
did not result from overlapping symptoms.<BR>

<P>
 Though many of the diagnostic fine points remain to be worked
out, there seems little doubt that coexisting ADHD and bipolar
disorder is a real problem that merits serious attention.  In
the past, some researchers doubted that bipolar disorder occurred
in children.  More recent studies have shown that bipolar disorder
can and does affect children.<BR>

<P>
 Bipolar disorder and other forms of mania in children can be
recognized using standard psychiatric tests, the new research
demonstrates.  It is important to recognize and treat bipolar
disorder when it is present, because even mild cases can cause
problems for the child in everyday life, increase the risk of
suicide, and increase the need for mental health care.<BR>

<P>
 The findings also provide important clues for identifying which
children with the very common diagnosis of ADHD are at risk of
developing bipolar disorder later on.  These children may have
worse ADHD than other children, have more behavior problems, and
have family members with bipolar and other mood disorders.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>New Editor Named for Leading Child &amp;
Adolescent Psychiatry Publication
</CENTER></H2>
<B>Mina K. Dulcan, M.D. </B>has been named the Editor Designate
of the <I>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry</I>.  Dr. Dulcan's 5-year term will begin January 1998
when she assumes editorship from John F. McDermott, Jr., M.D.
  The <I>Journal, </I>published monthly by Williams and Wilkens,
has a circulation of 9,500 and is the most widely respected scientific
publication in child and adolescent psychiatry in the world.<BR>

<P>
Lawrence A. Stone, M.D., AACAP President, said in his announcement,
&quot;Dr. Dulcan was chosen to fill this important position because
of her credentials as a clinician, researcher, and editor.  She
is well qualified to lead the AACAP and child and adolescent psychiatry
into the next decade.&quot;   On hearing of her appointment, Dr.
Dulcan stated: &quot;It is a singular honor to have been selected
from a distinguished group of child and adolescent psychiatrists
to be the fifth editor of the <U>Journal of the American Academy
of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</U>.  The <U>Journal</U> is
a crucial link between the latest research and excellent patient
care in mental health for children, adolescents, and their families.
 Dr. McDermott has been a superb leader of the <U>Journal</U>,
and I look forward to working with him in the transition period.&quot;
 <BR>

<P>
 Dr. Dulcan is Chief of the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,
Northwestern University Medical School; Margaret C. Osterman Professor
of Child Psychiatry and Head, Department of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry, Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago; and Head
of the Warren Wright Adolescent Center of Northwestern Memorial
Hospital in Chicago.  She is a graduate of Cornell University
and Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine.  She received
her training in psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic. 

<P>
Dr. McDermott spoke recently about his successor.  &quot;After
serving nearly two 5-year terms as Editor, I safely can say no
one seeks the job [of Journal Editor] without a real dedication
to our profession and a willingness to work very hard.  Besides
those qualities, Dr. Dulcan is a seasoned clinician, has a firm
sense of what constitutes scientific evidence, and is highly organized.
 She is a splendid choice for Editor and I am delighted she has
accepted the challenge.&quot;<BR>

<P>
An active child and adolescent psychiatrist since 1978, Dr. Dulcan
has made significant contributions to child and adolescent psychiatry.
 As a member of the AACAP, she has served as Contributing Editor
of the Newsletter (1977-1979), a Member of Council (1983-1986),
a Coordinator for Trainee Activities (1978-1981), and Secretary
(1991-1993).  Dr. Dulcan has also held numerous positions with
the American Psychiatric Association and the American Association
of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training.  She is a senior
examiner for the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, and
a member of the American Medical Association, the American College
of Psychiatrists, the Society of Professors of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry, the International Society for Research in Child and
Adolescent Psychopathology, and the American Society of Clinical
Psychopharmacology.  <BR>

<P>
Dr. Dulcan's editorial background includes the Editorial Board
of the <U>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry</U> (1987-1992), <U>Contemporary Psychiatry</U> (1987-1991),
<U>Journal of Psychiatric Education</U> (1988-1989), and <U>Academic
Psychiatry</U> (1989-1997).  With Richard Cohen, M.D., she edited
the <U>Basic Handbook of Training in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</U>.
 She has also been a consistent contributor to academic journals,
including the <U>Journal of the American Academy of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry</U>.  Her areas of expertise include Attention-Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder, brief psychotherapy, psychiatric epidemiology,

<H2><CENTER>Discipline Must Fit The Stage of Development</CENTER></H2>

<P>
<p>
The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry is concerned that adults are no longer
allowing children to be children.  The recent charges of school suspension and sexual harassment
against a six year old boy in North Carolina and a seven year old boy in New York for kissing a
classmate have raised the question of whether adults understand the process of early development. 
Children until the age of nine generally haven't reached puberty and their actions are impulsive and
innocent.  This is not to diminish the importance of teaching our children proper etiquette early
and being alert for signs of agressive conduct.
<p>
<p>
"I kissed a few girls when I was seven, it was fun, and I was a kid.  Kids should be kids and, as
important, adults should be adults," stated <b>Lawrence A. Stone, M.D.</b>, President of the American
Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, "Children's developmental stages are different, their
understandings are different, their values are different, and their abilities are different.  They are
not little adults.  They are innocent children who are seeking a better understanding of human
contact, and they learn by trial and error."   
<p>
<p>
Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists, experts in child development with an additional four years of
training in child psychiatry beyond medical school, stress the need for children to be loved through
measures of affection.  Children need this in order to develop into healthy individuals.  Adults
should help the child understand appropriate behavior, instead of punishing them in a way the
child may not understand (suspension, legal system).  The child's level of understanding is key to
healthy bonding with other individuals.  It is important for all who work with children to consider
a child's developmental stage when establishing classroom policy and discipline.  The discipline
must fit the behavior, intent, and developmental understanding of the child.  The early
developmental stage of childhood offers our best opportunity to nurture caring adults.<p>

<H2><CENTER>AACAP Announces 1996 Journal Awards
</CENTER></H2>
<P>
The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry annually
 honors <I>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry</I> papers for their outstanding contribution to child
and adolescent psychiatry research:  <B>The Norbert and Charlotte
Rieger Award for Scientific Achievement; The Nathan Cummings Foundation
Award for Research on Depression or Suicide; The Elaine Schlosser
Lewis Award for Research on Attention -Deficit Disorder and the
Psychotherapy Research Award.  </B>The four $5,000 <I>Journal
</I> Awards will be presented during the Academy's 43rd Annual
Meeting in Philadelphia, PA, October 22 - 27, 1996.<BR>
<P>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Peter Jensen, M.D. Receives Rieger Award for Best Research
Paper
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The highest honor for 1996 goes to Peter Jensen, M.D. of the National
Institute of Mental Health.  Dr. Jensen will receive the Norbert
and Charlotte Rieger Award for Scientific Achievement, given to
the best research paper published in the <I>Journal, </I>for his
article, <B>&quot;Children's Response to Parental Separation during
Operation Desert Storm,&quot;</B> April 1996.  This award is made
possible through a contribution from the Rieger Foundation.<BR>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dr. Jensen led the study of 383 families with children ranging
in age from 4 to 17 years.  Children whose parents were sent to
the Persian Gulf had slightly increased scores on a depression
test.  Though the children did become more depressed during the
separation, the increases were fairly small and boys were more
likely to become depressed.  When a child developed problems severe
enough to warrant the help of a child and adolescent psychiatrist,
the parent who was left behind was likely to have significant
problems as well.  The researchers suggested steps that may help
to lessen the impact of deployment on the children of military
families.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Peter M. Lewinsohn, Ph.D., Receives The Nathan Cummings
Foundation Award<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Nathan Cummings Foundation Award for Research on Depression
or Suicide has been awarded to Peter M. Lewinsohn, Ph.D. of the
Oregon Research Institute in Eugene, Oregon for his paper<B> &quot;Adolescent
Psychopathology: IV. Specificity of Psychosocial Risk Factors
for Depression and Substance Abuse in Older Adolescents,&quot;</B>
September 1995.  The Nathan Cummings Foundation Award, formerly
known as the Beatrice Cummings Mayer Award, is given to the best
paper on suicide and/or depression published in the <I>Journal</I>
and is made possible through a grant from the Nathan Cummings
Foundation.<BR>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The study identified risk factors, in adolescents 14 to 18 years
old, for major depressive disorder, substance abuse disorder,
or those that are general to both disorders.  Risk factors specific
to major depressive disorder were stress, emotional reliance,
physical symptoms and disease, history of suicide attempt, and
a past episode of depression or anxiety disorder.  Risk factors
specific to substance abuse disorder were tobacco use, academic
difficulties, and a past episode of substance abuse.  The study
concluded that by determining the number of risk factors present,
clinicians can make informed predictions concerning the probable
future onset of a full-fledged episode of major depression and/or
substance abuse in individual cases.  The results of this study
not only allow for the identification of adolescents at risk,
but have implications for the design of interventions aimed at
prevention.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Janet Wozniak, M.D. Receives Academy's Elaine Schlosser
Lewis Award for Research on Attention-Deficit Disorder<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Elaine Schlosser Lewis Award for Research on Attention-Deficit
Disorder was awarded to Janet Wozniak, M.D., of Massachusetts
General Hospital.  The award recognizes two outstanding articles,<B>
&quot;Mania-Like Symptoms Suggestive of Childhood-Onset Bipolar
Disorder in Clinically Referred Children,&quot;</B> from the July
1995 issue, and <B>&quot;A Pilot Family Study of Childhood-Onset
Mania&quot;</B> from the December 1995 issue of the  <I>Journal
of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</I>.
 The annual award is made possible by an anonymous contribution
in honor of Owen Lewis, M.D., and in recognition of his commitment
to helping children and adolescents affected by Attention-Deficit
Disorder.  The award is named in memory of Dr. Lewis' late mother,
Elaine Schlosser Lewis, a special education teacher and advocate
for children with ADD.  <BR>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The first article, &quot;Mania-Like Symptoms,&quot; examines the
expression of mania in children 12 or younger and the symptomatic
overlap with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
  The study of  291 children identified childhood-onset mania
as very severe and frequently occurring in combination with ADHD
and other psychiatric disorders. The study concluded that because
of the high comorbidity with ADHD, more work is needed to clarify
whether these children have ADHD, bipolar disorder, or both.


<P>
The second article, &quot;A Pilot Family Study,&quot; recounts
the investigation of familial association of attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder (BPD) among
the first-degree relatives of children with both ADHD and BPD.
 The study showed high rates of comorbidity between BPD and ADHD
in children and high rates of both BPD and ADHD in the first-degree
relatives of these children.  The findings provide family genetic
evidence of the validity of BPD and ADHD when they exist together
in children and suggest that the comorbid condition of ADHD+BPD
may be a distinct disease classification.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>William Beardslee, M.D. Receives Psychotherapy Research
Award<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
William Beardslee, M.D., of Children's Hospital in Boston, receives
the <I>Journal's</I> Psychotherapy Research Award for his paper,<B>
&quot;Response of Families to Two Preventive Intervention Strategies:
Long-Term Differences in Behavior and Attitude Change,&quot; </B>
 This award acknowledges work that best advances our understanding
of the essential elements of psychotherapy.  The Academy established
this award in 1995 to stimulate the field of psychotherapy research
and to recognize the importance of psychotherapy in child and
adolescent psychiatry. <BR>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study explored the long-term impact of two forms of preventive
intervention designed to diminish risk to children in families
in which one or both parents suffered from affective disorder.
 Fifty-four parents in 28 families were randomly assigned to one
of two interventions.  Families receiving the clinician-facilitated
intervention, where individual family life experiences were linked
to the presentation of information, reported more behavior and
attitude changes than did the lecture-group families, and these
changes were sustained over time.  The importance of a long-term
perspective is also emphasized by the fact that many of the significant
changes in the family emerged only over the 2 1/2 years following
intervention.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

        <p><font color="#006600" size="3"><b>Objective: </b>This
        symposium provides a discussion of the controversy about
        the suitability of a laboratory task, the continuous
        performance test (CPT), for treatment of children with
        attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in office
        practice. <b>Method:</b> Presenters summarize their most
        recent CPT study data on the cognitive function and
        medication responsiveness of children and adults with<b> </b>ADHD.
        <b>Results</b>: Dr. Conners presents a new CPT which
        measures sustained attention, response inhibition, and
        executive function in normal children and ADHD patients,
        child and adult, on and off medications. Dr. Gordon
        presents data from the Gordon Diagnostic System (GDS) CPT
        showing that poor performance on the GDS predicts
        academic impairment. Dr. Halperin presents data showing
        that although the CPT can distinguish ADHD from non-ADHD
        patients and controls, measures of sensitivity,
        specificity and<b> </b>positive and negative predictive
        power do not support its use for diagnosis. Dr. Greenberg
        presents data to illustrate how his CPT (the T.O.V.A.)
        Can be used to adjust medications. Dr. Sargeant applies
        CPT data to theories of cognitive dysfunction in ADHD. <b>Conclusions:</b>
        The applicability of the CPT for diagnosis and treatment
        of ADHD in office practice of ADHD is discussed.</font></p>

<H2><CENTER>Elite Female Gymnasts -- Is it &quot;achievement by
proxy?&quot;<BR>
</CENTER></H2>

<P>
With the 100th anniversary of the modern Olympics taking place
in our United States, all eyes are on the young heros of the &quot;games.&quot;
But, do we push our children too far, too fast? According to child
and adolescent psychiatrist <B>Ian Tofler, M.D., B.S.</B>, in
an article appearing today in the July 25, 1996 issue of <I>The
New England Journal of Medicine, </I>perhaps we are. In &quot;Physical
and Emotional Problems of Elite Female Gymnasts,&quot; Dr. Tofler,
Director of Child Psychiatry at Children's Hospital, New Orleans,
LA, and secretary of the International Society for Sports Psychiatry,
along with his colleagues across the nation, caution that there
is good reason to be concerned about the psychological and physical
problems associated with competitive sports--particularly women's
gymnastics.<BR>

<P>
According to <I>The New England Journal of Medicine</I>, gymnastics
is an intense, repetitive, high-impact sport which carries <B>a
high risk of both mental and physical injury--even possible death</B>.
Within the past five year, two US Olympic-level female gymnasts
have died from medical complications directly related to gymnastics.
The authors stress the need to establish coaching standards and
close monitoring of health and safety requirements for the athletes.
<P>
These young gymnasts place repetitive stress on their developing
musculoskeletal system that can lead to permanent injury or deformity.
They are also vulnerable to eating disorders, menstrual dysfunction,
and osteoporosis. Of equal concern is their mental development.
The pressure to perform well requires intense work outs -- elite
level gymnasts work out on average 30 to 45 hours per week, often
far from home -- which create social isolation and a lack of opportunities
for social development. Unfortunately, most coaches have little
knowledge of child development and often place unrealistic and
unhealthy physical or psychological demands on these children.
<P>
<B>Of perhaps greatest concern is the potential for abuse--both
self-abuse and abuse through &quot;achievement by proxy.&quot;</B>
&quot;The quest for success at the Olympic level ensures that
these girls may be driven beyond their physical and emotional
limits. There is also an element of self-abuse involved in competing
in an injured state,&quot; stated Dr. Tofler. In addition, he
fears that parents and coaches may seek to experience vicariously
the success of the child--&quot;achievement by proxy&quot;--pushing
a child into a potentially dangerous endeavor for the purpose
of gaining fame and fortune.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Lawrence Stone, M.D.</B>, President of the AACAP, notes that,
&quot;A child's physical development cannot be looked at independently
of that child's emotional and mental development. Both are critically
important.&quot; Dr. Stone also notes that, &quot;Sometimes it
is the child's passion that drives the achievement and for some
children the pursuit of excellence is appropriate. Yet parents
should not abandon their role in assessing the cost benefits of
such extreme achievement.&quot;<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Play Reflects Kids' Behavior Problems</CENTER></H2>

<P>

The games young children play may offer insights into their behavior problems, reports a study in
the October issue of <i>The Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</i>.

<p>
In the study, 51 children performed a story telling test at three, four, and five years of age.  The
children were told beginnings of stories about family relationships, conflicts, and emotional
situations - for example, spilling  juice or hearing parents argue.  The children then completed the
story in words and by acting it out with dolls and toys.  The researchers, led by child and
adolescent psychiatrist, <b>Susan L. Warren, M.D.</b> of the University of Minnesota, carefully noted
the emotions and themes reflected in the children's stories.<p>

<b>Four-and five-year-old children who act out stories in which characters cry or whine or hit
and hurt each other have a higher rate of aggressive-type behavior problems</b>, the new
research suggests.  Analyzing the way preschool children play, and particularly the stories they
tell, may offer a valuable glimpse into their "internal world."<p>

	<p>

<b>Four-and five-year-old children whose stories included signs of distress, such as whining or
crying, were more likely to have aggressive or "externalizing" behavior problems</b>, as rated
by parents and teachers.  In the same age group, behavior problems were also more likely in
children whose stories reflected destructive or aggressive themes, such as hitting or hurting
people.<p>

<p>

Distress and destruction during play were unrelated to behavior problems in three-year-olds,
whose stories were not as coherent or consistent as those of the older children.  Also, the story
themes of anger, sadness, and concern were not related to behavior problems.<p>

For children with aggressive behavior, themes of distress and destruction during play could
indicate difficulties in mastering conflicts and problems, or attempts to compensate for feelings of
vulnerability.  These themes might also reflect what the children have been exposed to at home or
on television and/or the way they handle real-life problems.<p>

<p>

Once they reached school age, some of the children with the highest levels of distress and
destruction at play were diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or other
problems.  More research is needed to see if a storytelling approach can help identify children who
should receive professional attention for aggressive behavior, as well as for such "internalizing"
disorders as depression and anxiety.<p>

<p>

<b>Child and adolescent psychiatrists and other child therapists have long observed children
at play as a way of evaluating them.</b>  The new research is the first to link the inner world of
preschool children with their external, measurable behavior problems.  Play observation is
especially important in the preschool age group because children cannot reliably describe their
thoughts and feelings in words until they are about eight years old.<p>

<TD valign="top" width="100%">The American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry (AACAP) announced Wednesday that it will not endorse the new
Television Parental Guidelines to be unveiled next week by Jack Valenti,
Chairman of the Motion Picture Association of American, and the TV Ratings
Implementation Group, unless those guidelines include content descriptors.
Presently, all indications are that the rating system will contain only
&quot;age appropriate&quot; designations. At the core of the AACAP's decision
is the knowledge that early mental, behavioral, and emotional development
does not always progress in accordance with a child's age. 
<P><B>Lawrence A. Stone, M.D</B>., President of the American Academy of
Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Executive Medical Director of Laurel
Ridge Hospital in San Antonio, Texas stated, &quot;A solely age-based system,
such as the one now being proposed, carries the risk of missing significant
developmental variations in young people.&quot; The fear is that a system
without content indicators can foster considerable misunderstanding and
inappropriate use of the rating scale by parents, other responsible adults,
and young people themselves. &quot;We are not trying to throw out the baby
with the bath water,&quot; continued Dr. Stone. &quot;We commend the effort
that has been expended and the progress that has been made by the TV Ratings
Implementation Group, however programs portraying graphic and realistic
violence, sex, horror, adult language, and illegal behavior without social
consequences increase the risk of dangerous behaviors and aberrant emotional
and intellectual development in children and adolescents.&quot; <B>Four-and
five-year-old children who act out stories in which characters cry or whine
or hit and hurt each other have a higher rate of aggressive-type behavior
problems</B>, the new research suggests. Analyzing the way preschool children
play, and particularly the stories they tell, may offer a valuable glimpse
into their &quot;internal world.&quot;</P>

<P>Another concern is that the networks will have control of rating their
own shows, which can result in inconsistent application of the rating scale
across networks. The standards and appraisal protocols for raters have
not been presented for evaluation, but &quot;the protocols and evaluation
process used in coding programs must be based on principles consistent
with solid child development knowledge and there must be some oversight
to make sure that it is consistent across the networks,&quot; stated Dr.
Stone. &quot;We have not had the opportunity to review these protocols
or to discuss their implementation, so again the Academy must reserve endorsement
of the proposed rating system.&quot; </P>

<P>The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry strongly supports
the need for a TV rating system--one that includes specific content information
in a user-friendly format where ratings are based upon a clear set of rating
criteria. &quot;We hope to continue our work with the TV Ratings Implementation
Group,&quot; concluded Dr. Stone. &quot;We want to provide the public with
a practical, credible, easily understandable rating system based on existing
responsible research.&quot; </P>

<H2><CENTER>Substance Abuse Treatment Meets Needs of American Indian Teens</CENTER></H2>

<P>

<p>
Drug and alcohol abuse in American Indian teenagers can be successfully treated in a residential
treatment program designed with their culture and unique characteristics in mind, reports a study
in the December issue of the <strong>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry</strong>.

<p>
Sixty-four American Indian adolescents in a residential treatment center for substance abuse
treatment were studied by <strong>Douglas K. Novins, M.D.</strong> and colleagues of the National Center for
American Indian and Alaska Native Mental Health Research at the University of Colorado.  The
treatment program was tailored to the needs of troubled American Indian youths.  Staffed mainly
by American Indians, the program incorporated traditional Indian healing and education with the
standard treatments for substance abuse and related problems.
<p>
The teens came for treatment from all over the United States, and stayed for an average of three
months.  Seventy-nine percent had legal problems, and 28 percent had been ordered into
treatment by the courts.  Almost all were using marijuana in addition to other drugs, and most
were physically dependent on alcohol.
<p>
The girls were more seriously disturbed than the boys.  They used more different and more
dangerous drugs, especially cocaine and amphetamines, and were more likely to have been
physically or sexually abused.
<P>
Two-thirds of the adolescents had other serious psychiatric symptoms in addition to substance
abuse.  More than one-third had symptoms of depression and one-half had signs of antisocial
behavior; one-third of the teens had attempted suicide.
<P>
Despite the severity of their symptoms, just 20 percent of the patients received mental health
treatment.  The girls in the program had no more psychiatric symptoms than the boys, but they
were more likely to receive mental health treatment:  33 percent versus 9 percent.  Forty-four
percent of the teens showed enough progress to "graduate" from the treatment program.  This
was a moderately good success rate, considering how severely disturbed the teens were to begin
with.
<P>
Drug and alcohol abuse is a major problem among American Indian youth, even more so than
among adolescents of other ethnic groups.  However, substance abuse treatment programs for
American Indian adolescents have been generally inadequate, and the subject has been largely
ignored in psychiatric research.

<P>
More attention is needed to the high level of other psychiatric symptoms among American Indian
youths who are drug and alcohol abusers, Dr. Novins and his colleagues believe.  They also urge
abuse treatment programs to consider possible differences between boys and girls, particularly the
high rate of abuse among girls and the low rate of mental health treatment for boys.

<p><strong>Welfare Reform update</strong>
<p>
<p>The new welfare reform law changes children's eligibility for Supplemental Security Income
(SSI). As a result of these changes, some children with mental illnesses could lose there SSI
benefits they now receive.  The most important provision for child and adolescent psychiatrists to
understand, involves the <u>automatic review</u> of all beneficiaries added to the rolls through an
individual functional assessment (IFA).  <u>IFA's will no longer be part of the eligibility criteria.</u> 
These children will now have to qualify through the Social Security Administration's new
definition of disability for children and meet the new eligibility standards.  Children with mental
illnesses are likely to have their cases reviewed because many children became eligible through the
IFA. 

<BR><br wp="br2">
<p>The new law does not stop benefits immediately, and not every child who receives SSI is under
review.  The Social Security Administration will notify each family by January 1, 1997, if their
child's case will be reviewed under the new welfare law.

<BR><br wp="br2">
<p>Changes to the SSI program:

<BR><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>The Social Security Administration will use a new definition of disability for children.  A
child must have a "medically determinable physical or mental impairment which results in
marked and severe functional limitations."</li>

<BR><br wp="br2">  <li>The "individualized functional assessment" (IFA) will no longer be used in determining
eligibility.  This assessment helped examiners compare a child's ability to function on a
daily basis with children their own age. The IFA was developed following a Supreme
Court decision on discriminatory eligibility for adults and children.</li>

<BR><br wp="br2">  <li>The Social Security Administration will change the way it considers certain behavior
problems caused by a child's mental or emotional condition. New eligibility standards are
currently being negotiated between the White House and the Social Security
Administration.</li>

<BR><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p>Although about 285,000 families of children with severe disabilities will receive notices of review,
the White House has been unable to determine the new eligibility standards.  Across the country,
editorials have urged President Clinton to be compassionate in setting the new eligibility
standards.  Other articles have focused on the plight of families of children with severe disabilities
who are likely to lose their benefits under any proposal the White House designs. This pressure
has made the decision even more difficult for President Clinton.  The President is expected to
make a personal decision on this issue in the near future.  Since, President Clinton is likely to be
personally involved in the rule-making process, continued pressure from the grassroots is
especially critical now.

<BR><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>What can you do?</u></strong>

<BR><br wp="br2">
<p>1. Call President Clinton, 202-456-1111 (email: president@whitehouse.gov); Carol Rasco,
Director of the Domestic Policy Council, 202-456-2216; and Frank Raines, Director of the Office
of Management and Budget, 202-395-4840 with this message:

<BR><br wp="br2">
<BLOCKQUOTE><strong>"The new standards for SSI eligibility must not hurt families of children with mental
illnesses; the power to hurt these children and their families, or to assist them is in
President Clinton's hands."</strong>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<p>2.  Watch for the President's decision on the new standards for SSI eligibility.

<BR>
<BR><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>Other Legislative Issues for the beginning of the 105th Congress</strong>

<BR><br wp="br2">
<p>The Office of Government Affairs is gearing-up for new legislation in the 105th Congress that will
affect children and adolescents with mental illnesses.  Universal health care access for children
with mental illnesses will lead our legislative agenda. We will also continue to keep you updated
on any legislation regarding gag clauses and funds for graduate medical education.  The Academy
will continue to monitor the reauthorizations of the Individuals with Disabilities Act and the
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act.  Both bills are likely to be at the top of each
authorizing committee's agenda.

<FONT SIZE=+2>G</FONT>ary is 34 years old. He was diagnosed with Limb-girdle Muscular 
Dystrophy at the age of eighteen. The doctors told him there was no cure, no
<IMG SRC="gary2.gif" ALT="Gary Detherow" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=183 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 ALIGN=right>
medicines to slow the progression, no therapy, and no treatment. He was told his body would slowly deteriorate, killing him. Despite this grim future, Gary
went on undaunted, waiting for a cure...a chance...hope.<P>


<FONT SIZE=+2>P</FONT>ressing on with his life, he attended the University of Memphis pursuing a
degree in business. He not only received his Bachelor's degree in Business
(graduating Cum Laude) but also his Master's degree. While at the University of Memphis, he was involved with the honor society Gamma Beta Phi and the Baptist Student Union. Since graduating he has remained active in church through Bible studies, puppet ministries and various other activities. And still he waited...still he prayed...still no cure...no chance...<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>G</FONT>ary, stronger in heart than in body, went on by 
God's grace meeting the challenges of this disease. He held positions as a programmer/consultant, a tax examiner, and a credit manager. He is now employed as a consultant at International Paper. And still he waited . . .<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>D</FONT>r. Peter E;. Law, Ph.D., of the <A HREF="http://www.celltherapy.com">Cell Therapy Research Foundation</A> in Memphis, Tennessee, has developed a tissue transplant called <A HREF="http://www.celltherapy.com/whatis.htm">Myoblast Transfer</A>. After taking a small muscle donation from a healthy young male, 50 billion immature muscle cells (myoblasts) are grown over the course of about two months through a process involving "cell stimulation." These myoblasts are injected into major muscle groups where they mature and graft onto the original muscle. As the diseased muscles die, the new muscles grow and replace them. Myoblast transfer is the first and only chance Gary has been given to live a long,  normal and productive life. Unfortunately, because it is still in clinical trials, insurance will not cover the expense of the transplant.<P>

<IMG SRC="gary.jpg" ALT="gary.jpg - 11.8 K" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=174 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 ALIGN=right>
<FONT SIZE=+2>G</FONT>od has granted Gary the gift to make others smile and laugh. Those that know Gary do not see him as diseased but as a caring and joyous man. This plea for help is hard for Gary. He has been one not to let others see the struggles that he faces every day; he tries to get people to see him and not the disease. But now, in order to have a chance, he must do what he has hated and bring attention to his condition. The cost of the transplant is <FONT  COLOR=#008000><B>$150,000</B></FONT>. We need help in raising this money.
 The sooner Gary gets the Myoblast Transfer. the better his chances of regaining the use of his muscles. The Myoblast Transfer is scheduled for March 11, 1997: The $150,000 is needed by January 28th in order to pay for the cost of the chemicals needed for
 growing the myoblasts. <B>The need is urgent.</B><P>

Many Mid-South families are burdened by the weight that money
problems bring.  Financial problems often lead to stress in relationships,
personal and work-related problems, and can cause families, businesses
and even countries to collapse.
<P>
The root of the problem is the lack of a strong financial foundation
and a realistically constructed budget.  Consumer Credit Counseling
Service (CCCS) can help you design a blueprint for your family's
financial health.  CCCS has professionals on staff to help you
learn how this can be accomplished.<BR>

financial or money management difficulties are the target population
of this service.  These problems are addressed through budget
counseling, a debt management program, and consumer education.

<P>
<CENTER><U><B>Budget Counseling</B></U></CENTER>
<P>
Budget counseling assists persons in developing a realistic budget,
improving money management skills, and solving financial problems.
 This service is offered free of charge to the general public.
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><U><B>Debt Management Program</B></U></CENTER>
<P>
The Debt Management Program, an alternative to Chapter 13 bankruptcy,
provides consumers the opportunity to participate in a plan for
the orderly liquidation of their debt.  It is designed for persons
who need the agency's assistance in developing and administering
a repayment plan.  The basic requirement for participation is
that clients have sufficient income to repay their debts according
to the plan that is agreed upon with their creditors.  Usually,
the plan will involve a lower monthly payment to grantors of unsecured
credit (such as credit cards), with the balance being paid off
over an extended period of time.
<P>
The Consumer Credit Counseling Service acts on behalf of the client/customer
in negotiating a repayment plan with creditors.  The creditor
voluntarily decides to accept an adjusted payment, just as the
client freely chooses to participate in the Debt Management Program.
<P>
Clients in the Debt Management Program are charged a fee of 3%
of their monthly deposit, up to a maximum of $20.00 per month,
as set by Tennessee State Law.  The only exception is that clients
seen at an office in Mississippi are not assessed a fee, per state
law.  Creditors are requested to contribute 15% of the funds returned
to them by the program.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><U><B>Educational Programs</B></U></CENTER>
<P>
Educational programs are available for presentation to agencies,
churches, employee groups, etc.  Topics include: cash crunch tips,
spending attitudes and patterns, an alternative to Chapter 13
bankruptcy, managing your cash flow more effectively.<BR>

The House of Mews is operated by the non-profit community service corporation, "Puddy Tat" Protectors.  We are staffed wholly by volunteers and are dedicated to the rescue, care, and adoption of homeless cats.  We currently have over 20 volunteers from all walks of life, from business owners, attorneys, teachers to housewives and even mother/daughter teams.  The community has been very supportive of this program through donations and feedback.<BR><P>

House of Mews is located in the Historic Cooper-Young District of Midtown Memphis, TN at 944 S.Cooper.  The House of Mews also features a unique retail gift and novelty shop showcasing high quality, local area and regional crafts on consignment.

<P>
Many Mid-South families are burdened by the weight that money
problems bring.  Financial problems often lead to stress in relationships,
personal and work-related problems, and can cause families, businesses
and even countries to collapse.
<P>
The root of the problem is the lack of a strong financial foundation
and a realistically constructed budget.  Consumer Credit Counseling
Service (CCCS) can help you design a blueprint for your family's
financial health.  CCCS has professionals on staff to help you
learn how this can be accomplished.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><U><B><FONT SIZE=4>Description of Services<BR>
</FONT></B></U></CENTER>
<P>
Consumers who are experiencing, or are at risk of developing,
financial or money management difficulties are the target population
of this service.  These problems are addressed through budget
counseling, a debt management program, and consumer education.
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><U><B>Budget Counseling</B></U></CENTER>
<P>
Budget counseling assists persons in developing a realistic budget,
improving money management skills, and solving financial problems.
 This service is offered free of charge to the general public.
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><U><B>Debt Management Program</B></U></CENTER>
<P>
The Debt Management Program, an alternative to Chapter 13 bankruptcy,
provides consumers the opportunity to participate in a plan for
the orderly liquidation of their debt.  It is designed for persons
who need the agency's assistance in developing and administering
a repayment plan.  The basic requirement for participation is
that clients have sufficient income to repay their debts according
to the plan that is agreed upon with their creditors.  Usually,
the plan will involve a lower monthly payment to grantors of unsecured
credit (such as credit cards), with the balance being paid off
over an extended period of time.
<P>
The Consumer Credit Counseling Service acts on behalf of the client/customer
in negotiating a repayment plan with creditors.  The creditor
voluntarily decides to accept an adjusted payment, just as the
client freely chooses to participate in the Debt Management Program.
<P>
Clients in the Debt Management Program are charged a fee of 3%
of their monthly deposit, up to a maximum of $20.00 per month,
as set by Tennessee State Law.  The only exception is that clients
seen at an office in Mississippi are not assessed a fee, per state
law.  Creditors are requested to contribute 15% of the funds returned
to them by the program.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><U><B>Educational Programs</B></U></CENTER>
<P>
Educational programs are available for presentation to agencies,
churches, employee groups, etc.  Topics include: cash crunch tips,
spending attitudes and patterns, an alternative to Chapter 13
bankruptcy, managing your cash flow more effectively.<BR>
