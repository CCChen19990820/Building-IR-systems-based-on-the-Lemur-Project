<h2>Who Is The Audience For This CD?</h2>
</a>

Welcome to the SIR-C Educational CD-ROM, Version 3 (SIRCED03).
<b>This edition of the CD was prepared especially for the IBM-PC
and compatible machines.</b>
This educational CD was produced by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory following
 the
successful flights of the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) on board the
Space Shuttle Endeavour in 1994.  <p>
<p>
This CD was designed 
<A HREF="STUDNTOV.HTM">
for use by students at middle schools, high schools and colleges.
</a>
It contains radar images of sites all around the world as seen
before and during the SIR-C missions.  It also contains hand held photographs
from the Space Shuttle, QuickTime movies from the missions, photographs from
the ground, etc.
<a href="../../DOCUMENT/HTML/CONTENTS.HTM">
Lesson plans 
</a>
are provided to help you learn about the images.<p>
<p>
You can use this CD in many ways from just viewing pictures
to performing science experiments with real data 
taken from Earth's orbit.  You can learn about Earth Observation and 
Imaging Radar through structured lesson plans, think up your own 
experiments, and analyze radar image data from the SIR-C 
missions. This gives you 
the ability to do 
the same kind of scientific analysis as scientists 
who are using SIR-C data
in their studies.  It's easiest to start by using the 
Netscape browser provided with this CD.

<a name="Navigate">
<h2>Navigating Around The CD</h2>

You can view all the images, movies, documentation,
lesson plans and learn all about imaging radar in the
<a href="../GUIDTOUR.HTM">
Guided Tour 
</a>
using the 
Netscape browser interface.  This is like having part of the 
Internet's <i>World Wide Web</i> (the Web)
on a disk!  If your computer has Internet access, there are links 
provided to a
companion <i>Home Page</i> to this CD, and to other NASA 
educational resources, such
as Spacelink. <p>
<p>
For some activities, such as image processing, you will have to go 
outside of the <b>Guided Tour</b> 
and traverse through the CD's directories and files.  
The 
<A HREF = "../../ROADMAP/REFERMAP/MAP.HTM">CD Reference Section</A> 
is your guide to the CD's directories and files.<p>

<a name="Requirements">
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
</a>

<b>This version of the CD was especially prepared 
for the IBM-PC and compatible 
machines.</b>
However this CD is ISO-9660 compatible so 
the image and text files should be readable on Macintosh and
Unix machines too.
The minimal computer hardware and operating system 
you will need to run the software on this CD:

<ol type=1>
<li>PC
<ul type=circle>

<li>A mouse device
</ul>
<p>

It is recommended that you have at 
least 10 megabytes of free hard disk space available on your machine.
You will also need a sound card with speakers if you wish to hear
the sound from the Quicktime movies. You can still play the movies
without sound though.
<p>

<li>New radar images!
<li>This CD is now readable from PC, Macintosh and Unix platforms!
<li>The Picture Room has been newly renovated!
<li>Lesson Plans, Teacher's Guide and Slides have been reformatted
    and are <i>much easier</i> to read and understand. Additional
    links to the images being studied make the lessons much more
    useful too.
<li>Pre-mission SIR-C images and information are now available!
<li>Student reports of the STS-59 mission and the crew notebook
    are now available!
</ul>

<a name="Teachers">
<H2>Information For Teachers</H2>
</a>

You'll find lesson plans and presentation materials to use in the 
classroom in the 
<A HREF = "../../DOCUMENT/HTML/CONTENTS.HTM">
Student/Teacher Lessons</A> 
section of this browser.  
You'll also find a Teachers Guide to use as a reference book.
It's a good idea to introduce the 
CD to your students by starting at the 
<a href="../GUIDTOUR.HTM">
Guided Tour. 
</a>
This is also 
a great way to see how the Web works in the classroom.
<p>

Use the Lesson Guide sheets as handouts for your students, or as overhead
slides to
prompt classroom discussion. The Lesson Guides work best when combined with the
slides materials (in the Slides directory), so that students learn a little
(from the teacher presenting the slides), then think a little (by going over
the Lesson Guide materials). Use the Teachers' Guide as a reference book so you
can answer student questions or to supplement the presentation materials.<p>
<p>

Select the materials that you think will work best for your class. This will
depend on their grade level, ability and what kind of computer equipment is
available in your classroom. In the one-computer classroom, try to do the
computer exercises as a joint class effort, with students guiding your hand (or
mouse). If you have a computer lab, have the students copy the
data and/or software they will use for 
a given lesson onto their own disk. This
makes finding files a lot easier.<p>

<H3>Useful Hints For Teachers</H3>

When running Netscape, select the <b>Options | Preferences</b> menu items. 
Reset the <i>Proportional font</i> to <i>Helvetica 14-point.</i> This makes
the text on the Guided Tour much easier to see on your monitor.<p>

The directory /DATA/MODS1TO5 contains all the images used in the 
lesson plans, divided up into 5 modules.
Each module contains the images as described in the
corresponding lesson module.

<a name="Files">
<H2>Opening Files On The CD</H2>
</a>

You can see most of the images on this CD and learn about 
imaging radar by using
the 
<a href="../GUIDTOUR.HTM">
Guided Tour.
</a>
You can also directly access the images, 
text files, radar data and software from the 
topmost directories on the CD labeled 
/DATA, 
/DOCUMENT and /SOFTWARE.  
For a map of the directories and files, see the
<A HREF = "../../ROADMAP/REFERMAP/MAP.HTM">CD Reference section</A><p>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 401:<STRONG>      Looking for information re commercial software for  DEM production from SAR imagery (INSAR). 11/13/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Johan Visagie, MBV Consulting Group, South Africa, jvisagie@mbv.co.za</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>401-1</STRONG>     Atlantis Scientific in Ottawa Canada sells a product called EarthView InSAR.  It is is used to process single look complex (SLC) interferometric pairs to produce DEMs, height change maps, coherence maps, etc..  The software has a Motif-based GUI, many tools, and support documentation.  The software is available for Sun Solaris and SGI IRIX (Release Dec 1996).  Processing of SLC imagery to make interferograms is automatic.  Phase unwrapping is automated as much as possible.  There is optional manual phase unwrapping to correct any remaining phase unwrapping errors.  JERS-1, ERS1/2, RADARSAT sensors are all supported.  Exciting applications of this software include change detection and land deformation measurement. We have achieved some impressive results studying earthquake deformation and land subsidence.  Atlantis also sells a SAR processor which is recommended for producing precision SAR imagery, but is not essential for using the EarthView InSAR software.    For  more information visit http://www.atlsci.com or email blynch@atlsci.com. 11/15/96<ADDRESS>Bernie Armour, Atlantis Scientific, barmour@atlsci.com</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 400:<STRONG>      Hi all,  We are interested in acquiring a SAR processor for   ERS and RADARSAT (single-beam) data for educational purposes.  Does  anyone know of the existence of a cheap processor that allows one  to stop processing at various stages (a necessary requirement for  educational purposes) ?  Preferences : chirp scaling included (hence no  data interpolation necessary and cleaner algorithm for students to follow) ?? 11/11/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Yves Moisan, Université de Sherbrooke, ymoisan@callisto.si.usherb.ca</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>400-1</STRONG>     Atlantis Scientific, Ottawa, Canada,  has two SAR processors which fill what you are looking for.    The first is a low cost Range/Doppler (with Secondary Range Compression) processor which accepts airborne SAR, and spaceborne JERS-1, ERS-1, ERS-2, RADARSAT standard, fine and wide beam data.  It runs on PCs, Suns, and SGI (coming soon!). This processor is called the ERGOvista SAR processor.  It produces multilook detected and  single look complex (phase preserved) imagery.  It is useful for SAR interferometry.  The second SAR processor is the APP (Advanced Precision Processor).  This processor is actually two SAR processors plus a suite of tools for advanced SAR processing work.  The two precision processing algorithms are: 1. Range Doppler with Secondary Range Compression. 2.

Our problem lies not locating the SIR-C data, but rather in locating a DEM for terrain correction.

Unfortunately, we have been unable to locate a digital version of this although we suspect that it does exist somewhere. We thought we would post here in hopes that someone who has used this SIR-C image of the Himalaya has already located this DEM.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 390:<STRONG>      I am looking for radar images of the ocean floors, in particular mid-ocean ridges and subduction  zones. Can anyone tell me an internet site which  would have these? 10/16/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Daniel Lewis, UCL, daniel.lewis@ucl.ac.uk</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>390-1</STRONG>     Before you can map the ocean floor with radar,  you will have to remove the salt water. Perhaps  you are thinking of Sonar images...  10/16/96<ADDRESS>Scott C.</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>390-2</STRONG>     Hello my friend, the following links will get you toward what you  are looking for. Bathymetric maps may be helpful.  Radar images would have to do with SEASAT data.  I've seen comparison pics of Nantucket Shoals  both lansat and seasat on a web page somewhere.  yes it looks right through the water. Try these  links, also search with Alta Vista search engine,  and call 1-800-usa-maps they have hydrographic  surveys on crrom as well as other prods. Hope that  Helps.   http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/announcements/announc e_hydro.html  http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/announcements/announc e_relief.html   http://modb.oce.ulg.ac.be/Form.Etopo.html http://www.whoi.edu/html/www-servers/oceanography. html http://www.usgs.gov/fgdc-catalog/main/nos.html http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/bathymetry/maps/nos_i ntro.html  10/24/96<ADDRESS>George Hardt, curious as ever, gsh@acadia.net</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 369:<STRONG>      Sometime during the seventies or perhaps late sixties JPL created a side-looking radar image of the Darien region of eastern Panama that was subsequently made into a 1:250,000 scale map of the area with the assistance of the DMA.   I think the project was subsequently written up in Scientific American.  Do you know anything about these images and are they available in digital or printed formats?   9/ 3/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>William Harp, Anthropologist, Cyber-Tech, S.A., harp@panama.phoenix.net</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>369-1</STRONG>     Harold MacDonald worked on that imagery.  He may  be able to put you into contact with someone who  can answer your questions.  I don't believe he is  online but a daytime phone is (501)575-4748. 9/16/96<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

Its a  unit of measuring resistance.  Resistors (measured  in ohms) limit the flow of electrons and in doing  so give off heat (energy has to dissapate in some  form).

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 361:<STRONG>      I have obtained RAVEN 2.0 from JPL to analyze  SIR-C images. The documentation says that RAVEN  requires IDL 3.5.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 360:<STRONG>      Can imaging radar, or some other remote sensing  technology be used to determine water depth?  I am speaking with specific reference to the Great Salt  Lake, Utah, which covers some 1.600 sq. mi., but  less than 35 ft. in depth.  Please respond to  e-mail "nrugs.wgwynn@state.ut.us".  Thanks     8/20/96</STRONG><ADDRESS></ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>360-1</STRONG>     No, water is a strong dielectric and radar is reflected (either specularly away from the  instrument or if the water is rough in a more lambertian manner). There would be minimal penetration leaving the lake bed invisible to the radar. Even wet snow is enough to effectively hide the ground from radar if it is deep enough.  9/10/96<ADDRESS>Tom Albright, ICESS and dept. of Geog., UC Santa Barbara, albright@icess.ucsb.edu</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>360-2</STRONG>     You can image using optical sensors, particularly ATM/TMS type sensors.  Some bathymetery has been done.  There is ongoing resaerch at Dundee University Scotland! 9/26/96<ADDRESS>Ian Brown, University of Dundee, i.a.brown@dundee.ac.uk</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>360-3</STRONG>     Swedish SAAB manufactures system called Hawkeye. A helicopter-borne green laser radar that can penetrate 16 m or more in good (clear) water conditions. Scans sideway- covers area when flown  12/29/96<ADDRESS>PeteUlriksen, Lund Univ Techn, Lund Sweden, peter.ulriksen@tg.lth.se</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>360-4</STRONG>     LANDSAT TM imagery, with appropriate bands  selected, can be used for bathymetry. I did  it in  the Bahamas, and don't know why it won't work in  the Lake. You'll have to do some  ground(uh-water)-truth to determine correspondence  between band returns and water depth. Then, a  litlle ratioing and supervised classifying and  you'll have it! 1/27/97<ADDRESS>Eloise Doherty, Univ. of Texas , Austin   Dept of Geosciences, edoherty@mail.utexas.edu</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 342:<STRONG>      I'd like to know why SIR-C geology datatakes were often taken in Mode 11? Just because of the wide data coverage? Can Mode 16 and other modes be better than Mode 11 for geological study in some  cases? Thanks a lot. 7/ 5/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Pinliang Dong, University of New Brunswick, Canada, y16y@unb.ca</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>342-1</STRONG>     Your speculation is correct.  Mode 11 provided dual pol data with a very wide swath - up to 80 km in some cases.  Mode 16, although it provides quad pol data, was too small a swath (usually less than 20 km).  Most of the SIR-C science team geologists preferred the wider swath to the quad pol data. 7/ 9/96<ADDRESS>Ellen O'Leary, JPL Radar Data Center, ellen@kahn.jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>342-2</STRONG>     It's been my experience that, for relatively  unvegetated geologic surfaces, a like and a cross  polarization give most of the useful information.  One of the disadvantages, though, is that current  inversion models require quad-pol data.   7/ 9/96<ADDRESS>Tom Farr, JPL, tom.farr@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 341:<STRONG>      Is Synthetic Appature radar effective at imaging rapidly moving targets? If so, what are the practical benefits of this? Has this been used in the commercial sector? Has RADARSAT ever imaged either a Space Shuttle launch or other expendable vehicle during its climb inot orbit? If so, can you direct me to any images of this that I might be able to view. Are there any current plans to launch a permanent SAR aboard the international space station? SRL flew onboard the shuttle twice to date. Is there talk of flying a third mission. 7/ 4/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Glen E. Swanson, gswanson@vixa.voyager.net</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>341-1</STRONG>     Moving targets are displaced due to their doppler  shift. I've seen images of trains where they're  off their tracks, due to this effect. I imagine  that if the target is moving too rapidly, it  would be shifted out of the band width of the  radar. I can think of no real commercial or  scientific benefits for this, but I'm sure the  military has studied this.  A P-band SAR was proposed a long time ago for  the space station, but was rejected. There are  no current plans.  A third mission of SRL, to make a topographic  map of the world is being proposed.   7/ 9/96<ADDRESS>Tom Farr, JPL, tom.farr@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>341-2</STRONG>     Metratek, Inc. located in Reston, Virginia  developed a Air to Air Imaging system that does  Synthetic Aperture Radar images while planes are  in flight to measure stealthliness of High-tech  low observable aircraft.  Contact Richard Harris  (703) 620-9500. 8/15/96<ADDRESS>Richard Harris, Metratek, Inc., 74224,1466@compuserve.com</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>341-3</STRONG>     The military has used SAR to detect and measure  moving targets.  I worked on the Goodyear  Aerospace APD-10 Side-Looking Radar (SLR) on RF-4C reconnaissance aircraft at Zweibruecken AB, Germany during the mid 1970's.  The system could  be selected to moving target information (MTI) mode; instead of showing 4 channels (adjacent tracks of terrain} on the image film, it would show two tracks of normal SLR imagery, followed by two tracks that showed only moving targets.  I  think that it changed a reference frequency in the signal processing path in order to register returns that had a doppler shift beyond the normal range.     It was "old technology" by today's standards;  it recorded the data as a holographic  representation of the doppler phase history of the returns, and the developed data film then focused  a laser beam in a correlator onto the image film to produce the map.  However, it was a good system inspite of its need for skilled maintenance, and was closed down mainly by poor logistic planning  (no spare parts!!!). I'm not very familiar with other SLR systems on  the U-2, SR-71, and the Army's OV-10 (Motorola). Try to contact Goodyear Aerospace, Motorola, or  other manufacturers about detecting moving targets.  9/ 5/96<ADDRESS>Tom Mathewson, tmathews@mail.kdcol.com</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 339:<STRONG>      How can I compute the baseline, in the repeat pass satellite interferometry ? Could anyone give me a list of some reference papers too ? Thanks in advance. 7/ 1/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Ohig Kwoun, UT-CSR, koi@poseidon.csr.utexas.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>339-1</STRONG>     There is an extensive reference list at:  http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/science/SAR_REFS.htm l#interferometry  7/ 9/96<ADDRESS>Tom Farr, JPL</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>339-2</STRONG>     Most of the papers you will find on that subject explains you how you can calculate or correct the baseline using the interferogram itself. But first, you generally need a first approximation to lower the fringe rate. When you use ERS images (I don't now for other SAR data), you will find in the header, five state vectors (Position and velocity) of the platform. If you approximate the orbits with straight lines between each of these state vectors, you can calculate a first approximation of the baseline. In the case of ERS images, the platform data are accurate enough to get a baseline with its azimutal dependence, generally suffisent for the whole interferometric process. Moreover, error calculs will shows you that an error on the baseline components induces (approximately) a plane in the resulting DTM. Thus, if you possess three control points you may correct your DTM a posteriori. 9/ 1/96<ADDRESS>Dominique Derauw, Centre Spatial de Liege (Belgium), dderauw@ulg.ac.be</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 337:<STRONG>      Can anyone tell me the difference between a pixel and a resolution cell? Is pixel-size the same as pixel-spacing? Thanks! 6/26/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Jaron Samson, jsamson@geo.tudelft.nl</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>337-1</STRONG>     In radar imaging, "resolution" has a very specific meaning.  There is "range resolution" (across  track) and "azimuth resolution" (along track).   These quantities depend on a number of factors,  including the wavelength of the radar, the distance to the target, the sampling frequency, the  bandwidth, etc.  Generally a "single look" radar image will have one pixel per resolution cell,  whose dimensions are range res by az res.  Most radar images you see published are "multi-look", in  which resolution cells have been averaged into  larger pixels to reduce speckle, and (commonly) to  create square pixels that reduce distortion  effects.  The terms pixel size and pixel spacing  are e 6/30/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>337-2</STRONG>     The terms pixel size and pixel spacing are  equivalent 6/30/96<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>337-3</STRONG>     That was once my question. The most simplest way of understanding. Resolution cell is the minimum size of a pixel that is required to represent a pixel. A RC can be divided into as many pixels as possible, but it doesnot give any additional information(it is pretty much like oversampling). If range resolution is 25 meter,  it means that you can identify two objects if they are separated at least 25 meters. In this case, the pixel spacing can be 12.5 meter - you are dividing a range cell into two pixels, but it doesnot provide any new information which was not identifyable in an image with pixel spacing of 25 meter.  Good luck. 6/30/96<ADDRESS>Oh-Ig Kwoun, CSR of UT @ Austin, koi@poseidon.csr.utexas.edu</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 333:<STRONG>      Hi.  I'm a graduate student at the University of  Canberra in Australia.  I would like to know why  C-band HH polarization SAR was chosen for  Radarsat 1.  Is it a good general purpose setup? Is it particularly useful for some applications? How useful is it for hydrology? Thanks in advance.  6/18/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Neil Sims, UNiversity of Canberra, u896296.canberra.edu.au</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>333-1</STRONG>     C-HH was chosen for RADARSAT-1, given that the  satellite was originally designed to track ice in  the Canadian Arctic.  Research showed that  HH-polarization was less sensitive to surface  roughness than C-VV (ERS-1), and therefore  provided better separability between open water  and frozen sea ice.  RADARSAT has been used  successfully for numerous applications, but its  primary strengths lie in detecting geological  structures, delineating flooded regions, DEM  generation, and for creating stereo pairs.  RADARSAT has been used in hydrology for coastal  zone mapping, ship detection, oil spill  monitoring, aquaculture detection and flood  monitoring. 11/ 8/96<ADDRESS>Pina Belperio, RADARSAT International, pbelperio@rsi.ca</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 330:<STRONG>      Speckle in SAR images are usually modelled by a multiplicative noise model where the intensity (power) has a negative exponential distribution. For complex images, the phase is modelled by an uniform distribution between -pi and pi.

If I have a complex image instead, would the phase also be correlated? Any response or reference would be greatly appreciated.

Look for SIR-C imagery at the <a href="http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landaac/sir-c/sir-c.html> USGS. </a> You might even try the <a href="http://services.esrin.esa.it/"> ESA </a> home page for information about ERS-1 and ERS-2.  You could attempt to work with the <a href="telnet://nasdadir@nsaeoc.eoc.nasda.go.jp"> NASDA </a> site which will give you access to JERS-1 data information.  Finally, you can find a treasure trove of useful images, and a very nice user interface at the <a href="http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/html/home.html"> NASA JSC image collection </a> where you will find mainly optical data.  If all this fails to locate data of your area, you may have to resort to data from other commercial satellites. Get in touch with me and I can give you pointers for that. 6/17/96<ADDRESS>Stephen McNeill, Landcare Research New Zealand, mcneills@landcare.cri.nz</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 325:<STRONG>      I'm looking for info on the use of ground penetrating radar images for use in farming. (soil compaction, moisture, etc) Can anyone direct me to someone using radar imaging in this way? Thanks. 6/ 4/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>KR, kreins@aol.com</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>325-1</STRONG>     You can find some information about using SAR for  soil moisture studies in the <a href =  "http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/nrc/chapter3.html">  hydrology chapter from NRC report </a>. Your  question reflects a common misunderstanding about  two radar technologies:  "Ground penetrating  radar" (GPR) is profiling technique used to detect  structures and objects underground.  It is  normally carried out on a platform that is dragged  or driven along the surface.  It does not produce  images; instead it produces cross-sectional  profiles of the radar echoes.  SAR (synthetic  aperture radar or "imaging radar") is a remote  sensing imaging technique normally flown on an  aircraft or spacecraft.  It DOES produce images.   Some of the confusion may arise because in rare  cases SAR can detect subsurface features - when  the surface consists of very dry materials, such  as sand.  Even in those rare cases, however, SAR  can opnly penetrate a few meters at most, while  low frequency GPR can profile to depths of 10s of  meters.  6/ 5/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>325-2</STRONG>     Contact Prof Mike Inggs at the University of Cape  Town , South Africa. " mikings@eleceng.uct.ac.za" He has done work on GPR and has developed a  dielectric probe specifically for use with the GPR  to determine the soil characteristics 6/ 5/96<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 323:<STRONG>      What I have read about multilook SAR says that the antenna is sudivided into regions that image the same area separately to reduce speckle. Does that mean the real antenna pattern stays the same and that we just synthesize two 1/2 length  arrays for two looks, etc. ? I'm confused... 6/ 2/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Kevin R. Duemmel, OSU Dept. of Astronomy Imaging Sciences Laboratory, duemmel@mps.ohio-state.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>323-1</STRONG>     I think that you are correct.  Typically, a point in an image is illuminated  by the SAR for 1 to 2 seconds.  This illumination time corresponds to the so-called integration time or synthetic aperture length.  One might divide the time over which on point is illuminated into 4 segments, say each of length 1/4 of the total synthetic aperture.  Once can then form a SAR image for each segment.  Each segment is called a "look" since it is being viewed from slightly different azimuth angles.  There is no reason why the segments or looks cannot overlap.   If the SAR processing parameters are accurate, the looks will be precisely coregistered, and thus can be averaged provided they have been first detected (coverted to a power image by squaring the complex pixel values). 6/ 7/96<ADDRESS>Bernie Armour, Atlantis Scientific Systems Group, Inc., Ottawa, Canada, barmour@atlsci.com</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 322:<STRONG>      why do most of your continental U.S. images (which  are funded by folks from all over the  country)cover areas of California?  who decides what is covered? 5/30/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>D Cohen</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>322-1</STRONG>     You are correct that we have posted more images of California than any other state.  There are several reasons for this.  The data collection during the SIR-C/X-SAR missions was prioritzed to a group of "supersites" selected by the scientists for intensive study.  Whenever the  shuttle was in position to image a supersite,  data were collected of that site.  The presence of  2 supersites in California meant more data were acquired there than any other state.  There were numerous other science targets in California as  well.  It is a big state with a tremendous  variety of land cover types.  A quick count  shows 15 states  represented out of the lower 48 in the released images at http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/sircxsar.  If you feel there is an interesting site in a state that has not been shown in our images, we welcome your suggestions.  Decisions on the "coverage" of SIR-C/X-SAR were made jointly by a group of 52 science teams from around the world.   Decisions on public image releases on the  internet come from my office on the SIR-C  project.  5/30/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 319:<STRONG>      We have used the CVERT2 software to convert sir-c  slc to data  in airsar CM format in order to process them into PCI polarimetric radar module.  We have used  PCI programs to generate the 10 channel of the  scattering matrix.  By viewing the dynamic range  of the HH, HV and VV polarized power (8 bit), we  realized that there is an unknown scaling factor. For example, the dynamic range of the hh image was  23.4 - 38.6 over an agricultural site.  We also looked at the header of the converted data and found out that the "comp scale factor" was set to  1.0000.  Obviously, the power values displayed  in the polarimetric signatures are also scaled. Where can we find any information about this  scaling factor?  Can we remove it easily?     5/27/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Heather McNairn/Yves Crevier, Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, heather.mcnairn@ccrs.nrcan.gc.ca / yves.crevier@ccrs.nrcan.gc.ca</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>319-1</STRONG>     You bring up a couple of issues :<p> 1)  unlike AIRSAR data, SIR-C compressed data does NOT have a comp scale factor - therefore, during conversion to AIRSAR format, the comp scale factor is set to 1.0000 - the compressed samples are already calibrated.  If you now use the PCI software, everything should be fine - however, due to limitations in the AIRSAR header, cvert converts everything to KM rather than meters. There may be some other header problems - since I don't have the pci package I haven't tried it out... <p> 2)  when making a byte image (8 bit) with the dcomp software, the data must be scaled to 0-255. This scale factor is printed out during execution, if you choose to use a scale factor rather than max/min.  These files are just regular byte files, and there is probably nothing special in the PCI package for reading them... 5/27/96<ADDRESS>Bruce Chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 313:<STRONG>      Is it possible to measure the thickness of sea ice, and tell how thick the water is beneath it from satellite imagery? 5/20/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Kevin, Student at U.Washington, brockway@u.washington.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>313-1</STRONG>     The color of the ice can give you some ideas of both, if the ice is homogeneous and if you know how does the calm sea look like without the ice cover, but unfortunately the amount of snow on ice does vary, as well as its properties. 5/26/96<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>313-2</STRONG>     The Univ. of Alaska, Fairbanks, has researchers spending a lot of time researching sea ice and also is the home of the Alaskan SAR Facility.  Try sending a general inquiry to: Dr. Martin O.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 312:<STRONG>      We are looking for an operational method to measure bare ground surfaces with cm-accuracy or better in 3D.  The area covered should be a couple of square meters.  A scanning laser profilometer or stereo camera system could be something that we are looking for. 5/20/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Teemu Tares, CEC Joint Research Centre, Italy, teemu.tares@jrc.it</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>312-1</STRONG>     The two techniques you mention are your best bets.  I have seen laser profilers, though I don't  remember the group that developed them. The  equipment will probably be expensive, but capable  of high resolution. Less expensive, particulary if  you have a platform at the right height (say 20 m  or so), would be close-range stereophotogrammetry.  You will need good, calibrated cameras such as  special Hasselblads. Data reduction will be the  expensive part of this technique, but it is  straightforward. You may be interested in a paper  on a helicopter-based stereo system:  Wall, S.D., T.G. Farr, J.-P.

ERS-1 (5.6 cm); ERS-2 (5.6 cm?); JERS ?;  ...and what are the tradeoffs between different  wavelenghts? 		  5/13/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Paul Vincent, University of Colorado, vincentp@ucsu.colorado.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>305-1</STRONG>     JERS-1 is L-band (23 cm) <p> SIR-C is C-band (5.8cm) and L-band(23cm), XSAR is X-band (3cm) 5/28/96<ADDRESS>Bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>305-2</STRONG>     Longer wavelengths are less sensitive to temporal change than shorter ones.  We produced a differential interferogram over Kobe, Japan where the two SAR images were acquired 1.5 years apart, and still there was good coherence.  This was with JERS-1 (23 cm wavelength). Such results would not be possible with C-band sensors.  However, we  have recently produced an interferogram and DEM using RADARSAT fine beam mode (C-band ~8x8m resolution) over a mostly exposed rock island that had excellent coherence.  Hence there are many areas over which good coherence can still be obtained even with C-band and X-band SARs. 6/ 7/96<ADDRESS>Bernie Armour, Atlantis Scientific Systems Group, Inc., barmour@atlsci.com</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 301:<STRONG>      I'm attemptng to develop algorithms (as automatic as possible) for an oil slick detection that uses Radarsat SAR data, although probably not exclusively. One of the problems to overcome is differentiating between natural oils put out by organisms (fish, algae, etc) and man-made spills. Another is the fact that wind and rain shadows have the same signature. Also, the damping effect on the capillary waves which makes the slick visible only occurs over a narrow range of wind speeds (~1.5 - 13 knots).  If anyone could offer me any advice as to how to proceed in this relatively new area of research, or could point me towards any papers written on this subject, I would be extremely grateful.  Gord 5/ 7/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Gord Bowman, Atlantis Scientific Systems Group Inc.

Magnetic anomalies are normally much too small to affect radar backscatter. An aeromagnetic  survey would be much more appropriate. If the  geologic structure of the kimberlite unit was  expressed at the surface, as outcrop, topography  or as a difference in soil and vegetation, then  something might show up on a radar image.  5/ 8/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>299-2</STRONG>     Non-extrusive kimberlites, or partially extrusive kimberlites can have ring-like fracture patterns associated with their emplacement.  Radar  may be the most useful in detectin these subtle features, particularly if there is overburden.  Radar would also be useful in detecting magnetic anomalous features in the tropics because magnetic features are often iron and magnesium rich, or  associated with these lithologies and rocks of  that chemical affinity tend to form erosionally resistant laterite ridges.   7/ 8/96<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 298:<STRONG>      Hello, I hope someone can answer a question about SIR-C's decibel scale for measuring backscatter. I understand that it is a logarithmic scale, but on what value is it based?  In other words, if ALL the radar was backscattered, what dB would that be?  Is it zero? 4/25/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>John Chadwick, Goddard, chadwick@sensor.gsfc.nasa.gov</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>298-1</STRONG>     Nothing special about the SIR-C scale here, but  let me try to explain this, as best I remember:  Decibel (dB) is simply another way to express numbers that commonly span many orders of  magnitude, usually with real values less than 1. The conversion is: 10 * log(base10) of the real number gives you the value in dB. Now, what do  those real numbers represent in radar? They are usually the "normalized radar backscatter cross section" also called "sigma zero". This is the backscatter cross section sigma (in units of  area) per area on the ground.  The backscatter  cross section is the cross sectional area of a  perfectly conducting sphere that would produce  the strength of signal that is observed. So sigma zero has units of area/area (i.e. dimensionless). A sigma zero dB value of 0 means that the  backscatter cross section of the pixel is equal  to the area of the pixel, so sigma/area = 1;  the log of 1 is 0 (times 10 is still zero).  Interestingly, sigma zero is often greater than 0  dB.  This happens on favorably oriented sloping  pixels, where the the radar beam is concentrating  more energy per area than it would on the assumed  flat surface, and the area normalization isn't  enough to make up the difference. Also, various  type of corner reflections can produce sigma zero  values greater than 0 dB.  If "ALL the radar was  backscattered", I think you'd be way over 0 dB,  since a pixel-sized conducting sphere wouldn't  send the energy in the backscatter direction  only.  4/27/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>298-2</STRONG>     In a more practical sense, I thought I would answer with how we determine the sigma0 values : <p> There are some objects that we know theoretically their "radar brightness", i.e. how much radiation will be reflected back to the radar antenna.  For instance, it is well known how "bright" (what we call sigma, as opposed to sigma0) a trihedral corner reflector will look.  So, if we image some corner reflectors (and we don't make any measurement errors), we can determine how bright everything should be in the image.  Then, we normalize these sigma values by the scattering area of each image pixel (usually we assume a smooth surface unless we know the topography). This is then called sigma0, the normalized radar backscatter cross section.  If you take 10log of these values, you get sigma0 in units of db.<p> I like to think of sigma0 as something sort of like the albedo, though this analogy is not completely accurate. 4/29/96<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 291:<STRONG>      I need to calibrate a JERS-1 image to obtain the radar cross section image. I found the formula sigma-0 = 10 * log(Sum(DN*DN)/n) + CF  where CF = -68.5. I didn't find how the CF (-68.5) was obtained. Does anybody know how can I find it?? 4/18/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Orlando Alves Maximo, maximo@ieav.cta.br</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>291-1</STRONG>     My hunch is that this conversion factor (CF) was chosen arbitrarily to be lower than any possible lowest backscatter target. The noise floor for JERS-1 is more likely in the -30 to -40 dB range. The CF is just a minimum backscatter value that corresponds to 0 DN in the image data.  4/18/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>291-2</STRONG>     The CF factor was obtained by looking at the backscatter from corner reflectors, and from distributed rain forest targets.  It is a calibration factor for converting DN values to sigma 0.  The noise floor is closer to -20 dB.<p>Take a look at <a href="http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/users/bc.jers/cal.html"> the paper we wrote on calibration of JERS-1 SAR data</a> 4/22/96<ADDRESS>Bruce Chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

Also, would anyone using radar imagry to identify tree stands, tree height, ground surface, or penetration of water, sand, gravel please contact me. Also, what images are available for southeast Alaska? Finally, how do I obtain printed copies of the reports foound in your library.   I  hate doing work at home like this, so please send email. These web pages are outstanding, except they could use another textured and more colorful background other than battleship gay.   More color would help.

You would need a package capable of interferometry processing and interferometric radar data (a special type of radar).  4/18/96<ADDRESS>Eric Fielding, Jet Propulsion Lab, Caltech, Eric.Fielding@JPL.NASA.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>288-2</STRONG>     For ERS-1, ERS-2 SAR images of Alaska, contact the Univ. of Alaska, Fairbanks, SAR Facility.   5/29/96<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 277:<STRONG>      I find myself wishing we'd had SAR technology on the Viking orbiters for exploring what the regoliths on Phobos and Deimos effectively masked.  Has SAR technology evolved enough at this point to afford control and understanding of depth penetration is such material, and does the data product afford any additional under- standing of the character of that surface?  3/29/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Duke B. Reiber, Research Writer, dreiber@iu.net</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>277-1</STRONG>     A conventional SAR would not tell you uniquely the thickness or depth of penetration of a planetary regolith.  A dual-frequency nadir-pointing sounder might be a better way to investigate the problem. The idea would be to use the higher frequency (short wavelength) channel to identify the range to the surface, and the low frequency (long wavelength) channel to penetrate into the regolith.  The difference in travel times would give you the thickness, and the dispersion and magnitude  of the echo could tell you something about the material properties.  Such ideas have been bounced around for a Mars or asteroid mission. 4/10/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 270:<STRONG>      We are putting on a conference at which  people will be displaying SIR-C images. Rather than potentially get complicated, is it advisable to ask presenters to simply save their images from ERDAS as TIFF files and display them at our meeting in Photo Shop?  Since large TIFF files can be a problem, should they be limited to something like 50 megs? 3/20/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Scot Smith, University of Florida, ses@ce.ufl.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>270-1</STRONG>     Yes, this is the best way to go.   But you better have 64 megs  of RAM and most of it allocated  to Photoshop.  Transport the  files as jpegs.  Or nobody  would be the wiser if you cut  the file size in thirds by going  to optimized 8-bit palettes.  PS would be happier if you  saved Tiffs as PS 3.0 files.   Also, a good video card with  ample VRAM and a 1200x  1600 monitor will help.  Or  are you using a projection  panel?  Remember, a  3-channel 50 meg file is 32  screenfuls for a normal 17"  monitor.  So at full depth,  we're looking at a lot of  scrolling. <hr><center> You're  welcome! tom @  emerald</center> <hr>  3/20/96<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 265:<STRONG>      Has anyone done a rough calculation of the processing and storage requirements for developing terrain elevation data from SAR interferometry?  I am embarking on such an estimate but feel that this must have been done many times before.  Help?  Thanks 3/19/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Jim Antonisse, Booz-Allen & Hamilton, jima@bah.com</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>265-1</STRONG>     I have been doing some processing of SAR interferometry data for making digital elevation models. The requirements vary depending on the data source and desired resolution. Feel free to ask me for more details. 4/18/96<ADDRESS>Eric Fielding, Jet Propulsion Lab, Caltech, Eric.Fielding@JPL.NASA.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>265-2</STRONG>     Atlantis Scientific Systems Group Inc. is  currently working on an interferometry SAR workstation (scheduled for release in July of  1996) which will produce high resolution DEMs using orbiting SAR sensors such as Radarsat,  ERS-1, ERS-2 and JERS-1. It will also produce normal and differential interferograms as well as many other products.  Detailed information on the InSAR Workstation and technical papers on interferometry can be found on  Atlantis' web page (http://www.atlsci.com). Also  see the article "Mapping a Broken Land" in the  April 96 issue of Earth Observation magazine and  its complementary article "Desktop SAR Processing:  No Longer the Best Kept Secret" in the March  issue. The EOM articles are not all that technical but the research papers (presented in various remote sensing symposiums) on the web page are.  Hope the info will help.

I am  particularly interested in eruptions around Quito. Can I get access images of Ecuadorian volcanoes between Quito and Otavalo?

Who can I discuss this with and who are the relevant points of contact for this data?? 3/13/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>John Isaacson, Ph.D., U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Lab, Champaign, IL, j-isaacson@cecer.army.mil</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>262-1</STRONG>     John, we do have some radar data over that area.  The EROS Data Center is the final archive and distribution facility for the data so I suggest you take a look at their web site to see if they have data that will be of use to you.  They are the first link under the related links section at the top of this homepage.  They have both the survey and the precision data posted and you can use a clickable map to focus your search.  If you don't find what you are looking for there it is possible that it has not yet been processed to a precision product.  If that is the case please let me know. 3/14/96<ADDRESS>Ellen O'Leary, JPL Radar Data Center, ellen.oleary@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>262-2</STRONG>     I saw a good remote sensing site  the other week that had free  online Landsat images for the  entire west coast of South  America.  They were dumbed  down in resolution, of course,  but still were very remarkable in  the details of volcanic flows.   Would tell you what to expect if  you had the budget to order  one.<br>Tom @ Emerald  3/16/96<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 257:<STRONG>      I've been trying to download the recent TIFF image of Santa Cruz Island (P-46629, or more specifically, http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/files/images/hi-res/p46629.tif) using Netscape 2.0.  The download regularly fails after 20 minutes, and given that the file is 22Mb, there's no way I'll ever be able to download it in under 20 minutes.  I've also tried directly ftp-ing to www.jpl.nasa.gov and downloading /pub/images/hi-res/p46629.tif, but the file is inaccessible.  Is there any way I can get this file?  Thanks. 3/ 4/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Greg Janee, GRC International, Inc., gjanee@sb.grci.com</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>257-1</STRONG>     Looks like you have found a new bug in the system here.  Seems that recent files in the /pub/images/hi-res area are linked to other disks.  Netscape apparently can follow these paths, but most ftp programs can't.  We'll get this cleared up ASAP, because as you note, it's tough to move such big files unless you have a patient ftp application. Watch this space for an update.  In the meantime, you might try to find a low-traffic time of the day (night) to use the Netscape method. 3/ 4/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>257-2</STRONG>     Greg, if you are still out there, and to other folks who encountered this problem, it has now been fixed. All the full-resolution .tif files on /pub/images/hi-res are now accessible via ftp, as well as by the web URL <a href = "http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/files/images/hi-res"> http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/files/images/hi-res </a>.  3/14/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 244:<STRONG>      I attempted to download the New York City Tiff image (p45621) twice on both a Mac and PC and in both instances the resulting file was corrupt. One program, JPEGView on the Mac, was able to open the file up to about the first 100 lines before encountering an end of file. Has anyone successfully downloaded this file or is the problem in the original file on this site? I need an image of Governor's Island and the tip of Manhattan for a friend's architecture school project; any suggestions on where I might find a better image than this SIR-C/X-SAR file? 2/19/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Douglas Yasso, yasso@interport.net</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>244-1</STRONG>     We checked this file and it looks ok. You might have better luck if you access the file  by anonymous ftp at jplpio.jpl.nasa.gov; cd  pub/images/hi-res; binary; then get p45621.tif. This is a big file (17 Mbytes). Make sure your viewer  software (such as JPEGView) has enough memory allocated for a file this big. 2/20/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 240:<STRONG>      We are using an MSC-product (run#11716), L-band. We have used CEOS_reader to unload the data. We would like to use ERDAS IMAGINE to import. Need: record length, number rows, number of columns, number of bands. But, ASCII header for image is confusing, since it reports a record length of 23020, but pixels/line is only 4604. HELP.  How do we IMPORT?  Also, what does "bytes per data group" mean?  Is this 16 bit data?   2/16/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>joe aufmuth, university of florida, ses@ce.ufl.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>240-1</STRONG>     You are skipping a step, I think. SIR-C data  are in a compressed format, which you need to decompress to make byte format images. Then you can import them into a program such as ERDAS Imagine. You should have received the decompression software (DCOMP) with the CEOS reader. If not, contact me via email and we will send it out. Sounds like the product you have is 5 bytes/pixel, hence the record length 23020 = 5 * 4604 pixels. This would be a 2-channel image (e.g., mode 11, LHH & LHV). 2/16/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 230:<STRONG>      When radar has a dihedral (double bounce) interaction with the ground and a tree trunk or corn stalk, will a vertical polarization produce a stronger return due to the vertical nature of the vegetation? Or will VV and HH be equally efficient at double bouncing? 2/ 6/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>John Chadwick, Hughes STX/Goddard, chadwick@sensor.gsfc.nasa.gov</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>230-1</STRONG>     It depends on the size (diameter) of the trunks or  stalks when copared with the radar wavelength. Usually  the HH return is stronger because the forward reflection off  the ground is very much larger for horizontally  polarized waves than vertically polarized waves. In a lot of  cases, the H and V reflection terms off the trunks are comparable, so the overall result is HH >> VV for  double-bounce. 2/11/96<ADDRESS>Tony Freeman, JPL</ADDRESS>

But, in specific cases they can.  If you think that the ground resolution of the best airborne radars is in the order of two meters and, that radar backscatter (i.e. the measured signal) is very noisy, you easily understand how difficult it is to say if a specific pixel includes a human or if it's just noise (i.e. speckle).  But, if that creature on one pixel has something that very strongly reflects the radar signal, you'll see a 'light spot' on the otherwise relatively dark background - no matter of the ground resolution.  The Radio Laboratory of Helsinki University of Technology in Finland, has developed a radar by which it is possible to locate individual people in a stormy sea, for example, but those persons must be wearing a special type of rescue suit equipped with radar reflectors.  In order to be sure of the origin of the backscatter you normally need to observe many adjasent pixels.  That way, a group of people in a desert could be located, because the backscatter from that area differs from its surrounding areas.  With a ground-based radar you can easily detect individual people, especially if they are moving.  In 1988, we sometimes used to arrange running 'competitions' in the beam of a (very low power!) ranging scatterometer (a simple radar).  And, it was very funny to look the recorded signal on display, where you could easily detect the individual runners and how their relative locations were changing during that 100m spurt!  So, as a conlusion if you let a radar beam to scan over an area, you can see if there are some changes because of moving targets. This is reality on the borders of many contries.

<STRONG>227-3</STRONG>     To add to the response above, it may be possible to  detect humans using imaging radar with high enough resolution. say < 1 meter. But this is very difficult to do from space so  would not be possible with current spaceborne radars. With airborne radars it is different and resolution of < 1 meter  is possible. But it would be very difficult to interpret  the radar signature of a person as being different from the surrounding landscape.  2/11/96<ADDRESS>Tony Freeman, JPL</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 226:<STRONG>      <HTML>   <BODY>  SIR-C collects only high  incidence angle data, right?   That is, the reflected signal  has to bounce essentially  straight back to be detected.   Now Magellan obtained low  incidence radar data by  glancing a reflection from the  Venetian surface back to Earth  for detection.  The January 5,  1996 issue of<i>Science</i>  asserts that low incidence  radar data contains  information not accessible  otherwise, here, enough to  interpret specularity in the  Maxwell Montes highlands as  <i>tellurium frost.</i>   My  questions: <ol> <li>What <b> new </b>sorts of  information does low incidence  radar data contain? <li>Is there <b>terrestrial</b>  low incidence data, what was it  good for, and where can I find  it?  </ol><center>tom @ emerald  <hr width =50%></center> </BODY>   </HTML>    2/ 1/96</STRONG><ADDRESS></ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>226-1</STRONG>     For most of their operations, Magellan and SIR-C obtained data at very similar incidence angles (20-60 degrees from vertical).  The special  Magellan experiment to which you refer, was a "bi-static" radar experiment, where the radar beam was transmitted by Magellan's antenna, bounced off Venus' surface and recorded on Earth using large Deep Space Network antennas.  The experiment was designed so the "mirror" reflection from the surface would be expected to aim directly towards Earth. The signals received cannot be formed into an image, but their intensity and polarization properties can be used to infer something about the surface, primarily roughness and dielectric constant.  "Tellurium  frost" is only one of many feasible explanations for the echoes observed at Maxwell Montes. There have been some attempts to obtain bi-static echoes from the Earth's  surface, e.g., using airborne and orbital radars simultaneously, but I am not aware of any significant findings from  these experiments. "Grazing" incidence bi-static  observations are difficult to obtain on Earth, and it's not clear what their utility might be.  2/ 5/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>226-2</STRONG>     Reflectivity measurements could be one utility,  But, image formation problem needs to be solved. We have some mono-static low incidence angle (i.e. 0 - 20 degrees) data of mostly forests and sea-ice, but that kind of data cannot currently be obtained in a form of an image, and in addition it's normally not public.  But, if you really think you need that and have the resources to work with it, please, contact to Dr. Juha Hyyppa in hyyppa@ava.hut.fi. 2/ 9/96<ADDRESS>teemu.tares@jrc.it</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>226-3</STRONG>     Your initial statement that SIR-C collected only high incidence angle data is  wrong. SIR-C actually imaged from 10 degrees in some cases to 70 degrees incidence. By the way, 10 degrees is looking almost straight down.  Airborne radars have been built that operate quite well  at 80 degrees incidence, which is almost looking  straight out. 2/11/96<ADDRESS>Tony Freeman, JPL</ADDRESS>

Planetary radar astronomy, which uses large radio-telescopes such as the Arecibo dish in Puerto Rico, only works for objects with solid surfaces reachable by the radio waves. So gas planets can't be observed - the signal would just go into the atmosphere and be absorbed. The moons of the gas planets have been observed with radar, since they have solid ice or rocky surfaces. 1/30/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, JPL, Planetary Geology Group, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 216:<STRONG>      The cross-range doppler bandwidth of resolution cells in SAR imagery is often lower than the doppler spreads measured for the internal motion of various kind of vegetation. Does anyone have a good explaination why the returns from trees in SAR images do not spread out over many resolution cells and lead to poor quality images? My calculations indicate that in mildly windy conditions the return from an isolated tree should be visible in 5-10 cells to either side of the tree. Obviously this result is specific to one system (x-band 1.5m x-range resolution) The doppler bandwidth estimate for the tree canopy comes from several different sources and exceeds the resolution cell bandwidth by a factor 10. 1/24/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>mark williams, DRA - Malvern - England, mlwilliams%taz.dnet@hermes.dra.hmg.gb</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>216-1</STRONG>     I worked with an X-band image a few years ago acquired by ERIM's IFSAR instument over Iowa City. There were several "smeared" areas in the image we attributed to doppler smearing from winds in trees. 1/25/96<ADDRESS>John Chadwick, Goddard Space Flight Center, chadwick@sensor.gsfc.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>216-2</STRONG>     You are quite right to say that airborne SAR X-band  imagery will have smearing on it due to  wind-induced motion. From space the Doppler bandwidth  due to motion of the spacecraft past the imaged area is typically in the range 1300 to 1700 Hz. The wind-induced Doppler spread is normally much less than this. 2/11/96<ADDRESS>Tony Freeman, JPL</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>216-3</STRONG>     I have seen several example of SAR (X-Band) Imagery that has randome areas of defocus that we have attributed to motion in the vegitaion. These areas of defocus are different from the normal radar induced defocus artifacts as they are not alinged with range or azimuth but appear 'patchy' in nature. Most defocus associated with a radar, or motion compensation, fault are manifested in the range or azimuth direction We do a lot of X-Band SAR testing in the eastern foothills of the Canadian Rocky Mountains and whenever the 'Chinook' winds blow we see generally patchy  defocused imagery. 4/25/96<ADDRESS>Steve Tanton, Intermap Technologies Ltd, stanton@ims.calgary.intera.cs</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 215:<STRONG>      I am using Cloude's decomposition to obtain the power of single (odd) and double (even) bounce returns in SIR-C images, but I'm not sure how the decomposition works.  How does it separate the two returns and what is the difference between the two when they arrive back at the antenna? 1/23/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>John Chadwick, Goddard Space Center, chadwick@sensor.gsfc.nasa.gov</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>215-1</STRONG>     The basic theory rests on the fact that a single  coherent reflection ("bounce") changes the phase  of a signal by 180 degrees.  So odd (mostly single)  bounce returns will have an opposite phase of even  (usually double) bounce returns.  Since a polarimetric  radar records both amplitude and phase of the different  polarizations, the two types of reflections can be  discriminated.  For details on the decomposition  algorithm, you'll need to dig into the literature. 1/24/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>215-2</STRONG>     I need to clarify the above response a bit.  A single  bounce changes the phase *difference* between HH and  VV by 180 degrees.  So according to the usual convention (transmitting H and V 180 degrees out of phase),  an HH-VV phase difference of zero represents a single (or  odd) reflection, and an HH-VV phase difference of 180  degrees represents a double (even) reflection. 1/24/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 213:<STRONG>      since we have the hubble telescope can we find the voyger probe and if so could we build small verision to to send in series to explore black holes and white draf stars and monitor it from the space platfrom we are currently working on.   Also can you tell me if this galaxy is and x and y plane or is there a z plane involed with the new comet.  please send repsonse to choochoo@flash.net thanks 1/22/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>mark a yarborough, none, choochoo@flash.net</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>213-1</STRONG>     I noticed this unanswered question while browsing, so I'll give it a shot:  1) The Hubble telescope, while it may be capable of seeing Voyager with a long enough observation time (or perhaps not... it's really dark at that distance from the Sun), is not the best means of tracking a spacecraft, so we wouldn't use it that way. By monitoring the radio transponder on  Voyager, we get position information within a few kilometers of accuracy -- perhaps better, but I'm not the expert on that.  2) Yes, we could build small probes similar to Voyager in function using advanced techniques. However, we cannot send them out "in series" along the exact same path, because both Voyager space- craft used the gravity of several planets to boost their speed and to shape their course; the planets aren't due to be in the right places to do that again for another hundred years or so. We don't have rockets powerful enough do duplicate the Voyager trajectories.  3) White dwarves are light-years away. Each light year is about 9,460,000,000,000 kilometers long, and the Voyagers are only traveling at about 17.4 and 16 kilometers/second, or about 17,240 years to travel a light-year. I'm afraid it's not at all practical for us to explore white dwarves just yet.     Black holes, on the other hand, could be closer than white dwarves; since they swallow up anything near them, even light, they could be closer, and we'd never know. We have only a few ways to detect their presence. One is, if a black hole were close enough, we would see the effects of its gravity on the planets of our solar system. If it were that close, we could probably fly a probe to it. However, we don't see any unexplained motion in the planets, so we don't think any black holes are that close. Another way to detect them is by the release of radiation, heat and light that happens when something falls into them. This can be very spectacular if a lot of stuff is falling in... we think Hubble has found places billions of light-years away where this is happening. But we're not seeing anything like that nearby, so we believe that there are no black holes close enough to send a probe to, either.  4) The new comet is gone already (this is months after your original questions), but in answer to your question about whether the galaxy has a x,y, and z plane, the answer is yes. The galaxy is flat and thin, like a dish, but it does have thickness. I don't have the figures at hand, but it's some 250,000 light-years across and several thousand thick. Usually one chooses to use X and Y numbers to measure points on the disk, and Z to measure how far above or below the disk. Not all objects in our galaxy are contained in this thin disk; many travel a path that swings far above and below the disk. Our solar system also is shaped flat, but it is tipped compared to the galaxy around us. The recent comet was an unusual object compared to most in our solar system, in that it came in well above the disk shape of our solar system, whipped around the sun, and exited well below; that's why it seemed to fly near our North Star on the way in.  5/13/96<ADDRESS>Peter.D.Jones@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<STRONG>212-2</STRONG>     No, in fact, launching out of Florida  it is not possible to have an orbital inclination greater than 57 degrees (a polar orbit would be  close to 90 degrees). The reason for this is that  the Shuttle has to launch over water in case of  accident.      If the Vandenburg, CA shuttle launch facility  had been completed, polar orbiting shuttle flights  would have become routine. 1/24/96<ADDRESS>Tony Freeman, JPL</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 211:<STRONG>      I am 11years old. I was wondering what kind of radar can detect the SR-71 and whatkind of radar is used on it?	  1/18/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Matthew Paulesn, davep@garlic.com</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>211-1</STRONG>     SR 71 is a stealth aircraft. and since it is  stealth it cannot be detected by any radar  systems. For the second part of your question I am  not very sure.  1/30/96<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>211-2</STRONG>     Any aircraft, stealth or otherwise, can be detected by radar.  A stealth aircraft is designed to minimize the probability of detection, so it is harder to detect than a regular aircraft, but it still can be detected.   The SR 71 is not a stealth aircraft, and can be detected  by most air surveillance radar systems, however it flys  so high and so fast that there is little that can be  done to it.  I don't know what kind of radar (or radars)  is used on it. 2/ 1/96<ADDRESS>Robert D. Rowe, Principal Investigator, Radar Signature Technology, rower@iscmed.med.ge.com</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>211-3</STRONG>     The SR-71 has a SAR known as ASARS. Goodyear built the first one (ASARS-I) and Hughes built the second one (ASARS-II).  5/ 6/96<ADDRESS>Joe Arnold, Lockheed Martin - Tactical Systems Division, AZ, 70250.222@compuserve.com</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 210:<STRONG>      The SIR-C calibration article by Freeman et al. (IEEE Trans. Geosci. Rem. Sens.  33: 848-857) shows various calibration uncertainties for the 2 SRL flights (tables 8 and 9). For instance, the  pass-to-pass uncertainty at L-band for SRL-1 is +-1.3dB. How exactly should this uncertainty be interpreted? Is it a confidence interval so that one can assume, for instance, that backscatter from identical targets at the same incidence angles on two different passes will be within +-1.3dB 90% of the time? Or 95%, or 100% of the time? Is the calibration uncertainty to be interpreted differ- ently for point and distributed targets? Also, is the co-pol to cross-pol amplitude uncertainty equal to the sum of the HH/VV amplitude imbalance and the HV/VH amplitude imbalance? 1/18/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>Laura Hess and John Day, Dept of Geography, UC Santa Barbara, lola@icess.ucsb.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>210-1</STRONG>     Maybe they mean with "uncertainty" just the standard deviation of the measured values.  That's easy to give when you actually don't know if the distribution is Gaussian or not.  Why don't you ask them directly?  Regards,  Teemu Tares.  2/ 1/96<ADDRESS>Teemu Tares, teemu,tares@jrc.it</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>210-2</STRONG>       The pass-to-pass uncertainty was generated by  looking at corner reflector signatures for many  data-takes at many different incidence angles.  Within any given data-take there was a large  variation in the RCS of each reflector which  we attributed to 'local variations' in reflector  RCS and background conditions. We had evidence  from scenes over the Amazon that the actual total  radiometric variation across any given scene was  actually quite small (+ or - 0.6 dB). So to  estimate the overall variations in RCS we took  the average residual gain for each set of  reflectors (i.e each scene) and looked at the  overall variation in that quantity (peak-to-peak).  This seemed to be conservative enough.      Sorry I don't have a 'confidence interval' to  go with this value, only the list of exceptions  noted in our TGARS paper. Calibration uncertainties  for point and distributed targets should be no  different.     For the co-pol to cross-pol uncertainty, you  should use the HH-VV results as being  representative of the HH-HV imbalances.   2/11/96<ADDRESS>Tony Freeman, JPL</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 209:<STRONG>      I'm interested in the processing required for SAR imaging.  For the SIR-C what is the reconstructed pixel rate(pixels per second), the number of floating point operations per final pixel, and the number of bits per pixel?  What type of processor is used, special purpose or general and what chip types/vendor, and is it on-board or ground based.  Thanks for any assistance 1/15/96</STRONG><ADDRESS>tom trinko</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>209-1</STRONG>     I can only answer some of your questions - maybe I can only answer some of your questions, maybe someone else can answer the  others... <p> The number of bits per pixel varies depending on the mode the data was collected in - quad pol data is saved in a special compressed format and is 80 bits per pixel.  single pol data is just 16 bits per pixel.  (take a look at  the <a href="/sample.html">sample data tape description for more information</a> about this.) <p>The processor runs on a CM5, and is on the ground.  While SIR-C was flying, high density tapes were used to store the data and were brought back down to earth.  The software was written mostly in C (I think).  The processing is very intensive - we are still processing data from a mission that occurred almost two years ago.<p>  1/15/96<ADDRESS>Bruce Chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>209-2</STRONG>     Thanks for the information.  I'd really like to know  the processing time(CPU not wallclock) for a single final image pixel, or the time for a single frame and the number of pixels on the CM-5. Also how many CM-5 nodes are assigned to the task. Thanks. 1/16/96<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 202:<STRONG>      Can these sattelites find water in certain places in the desert? 12/22/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Donald Zamboni, fax (310) 804-1324</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>202-1</STRONG>     On ground, the water area must be "wide enough", say, tens of pixels, in order to get it visible out of the speckle.  Bright spots on a dry desert could be a sign of moist soil in an area smaller than the resolution cell, but more likely it's just speckle.  But, if you have many images you can reduce the speckle by averaging or prinvipal component analysis, for example.  If the sand is very dry, water could be seen couple of meters inside the ground.  By the way, may I ask if you are developing an application in order to locate water (among others) in the desert? 2/ 1/96<ADDRESS>Teemu Tares, teemu.tares@jrc.it</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 190:<STRONG>      Can anybody tell me how does the JPL Byte_image code scale SIR-C MLC data and how I can get back either power or sigma-o from the 8-byte files produced by this code if I know the scale factor originally used?  12/ 9/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>P.Clemente-Colon, NOAA/NESDIS, pablo@orbit.nesdis.noaa.gov</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>190-1</STRONG>     when you run byte_image (or dcomp) to synthesize a byte image, you can still get the sigma0 value from the byte image if you save the "average scale factor" (if you scale the data by a scale factor) .  This average scale factor was multiplied by the data values to get the byte values.  If you put in a relative scale factor other than 1., this number is also multiplied times the data values. <p> Therefore, to get the sigma0 value, take 10log of (byte value)/average scale factor/relative scale factor (that you enter). This number will be quantized by the scaling to 0-255, and the dynamic range will similarly be restricted (255 and 0 will indicate saturated pixels) 12/11/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 187:<STRONG>      hi, Although L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radars have been used to produce high  quality images, has there been any attempt to use the Ultra Wide Band UHF.  In an earlier paper I had argued that with large band width avaliable, the number of independent samples that can be averaged are high. Consequently averaging these "indepentent samples" can produce a sharper image, even when the entire aperture  is not used. (ie smallest possible resolution is not used).  I was looking to see if there had been similar work done at UHF for foilage penetarting, imaging radar. Pointers to sources and refrences will be greatly appreciated. 12/ 8/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Atiq Ahamad, Architecture Technology Corporation, aa@atcorp.com</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>187-1</STRONG>     JPL's airborne SAR, <a href="www-airsar.jpl.nasa.gov">AIRSAR </a>,operates  at three frequencies:  C-band, L-band, and P-band (400MHz).  However, currently the bandwidth  is restricted in most cases to 20 MHz.  AIRSAR has been used to study  foliage penetration at P-band, among other things. 12/ 8/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>187-2</STRONG>     Averaging several lower-resolution images at UHF can  produce a better-looking image, because this type of non-coherent averaging reduces the variance in radar images which we call speckle. It does not produce a 'sharper' image, in that the resolution is not improved by this process.   There were recently published three good papers on  using the AIRSAR P-Band for foliage penetration in the latest isuue of IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and  Electronic Systems. The authors were from MIT-Lincoln Labs.  2/11/96<ADDRESS>Tony Freeman, JPL</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 186:<STRONG>      Sorry for the previous void question : I was too quick on the return button !  Anyhow, here is the question : I would like to be able to create layover and shadows masks given a DEM and info on the viewing geometry (bearing, altitude ...) and also given some conventional backscatter function.  Does anyone know of software and/or approaches (e.g. ray tracing ?) to do that ? 12/ 7/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Yves Moisan, Universite de Sherbrooke, ymoisan@magellan.geo.usherb.ca</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>186-1</STRONG>     I've generated images of (imaginary) landscapes with images projected on them, for example rivers outlined in blue and eroded areas colored differently. For this I use the POV-Ray raytracer (free) which does this well.  Have a look at my home page landscape section at the following URL:    http://www-leland.stanford.edu/~beale/land/index.html regards, john beale <beale@jump.stanford.edu> 12/ 7/95<ADDRESS>John Beale, Stanford University, beale@jump.stanford.edu</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>186-2</STRONG>     Please, take a look in http://www.vtt.fi/aut/ava/rs/products.html There is a program called VIP which can do this. 2/ 1/96<ADDRESS>teemu.tares@jrc.it</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>186-3</STRONG>     The EarthView software (for PC or Sun) has a Remote Sensing package that will geocode SAR imagery using a DEM and also generate a shadow and layover mask.  With some care and a good DEM, the results are quite precise.  You take a look at http:/www.atlsci.com for info on EarthView. 6/ 8/96<ADDRESS>Bernie Armour, Atlantis Scientific, Ottawa, Canada, barmour@atlsci.com</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 183:<STRONG>      A BASIC QUESTION : As the moisture content of a material increases, the dielectric constant also increases .OK. BUT WHY the backscatter coefficient also increases ??? Is there someone to explain me that? Bye. 12/ 6/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Bonnaffoux Gerald, bonnafou@univ-brest.fr</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>183-1</STRONG>     The dielectric constant determines the balance between  the reflected and transmitted portions of the impinging  wave. High dielectric -> more reflection.  The backscatter  coefficient is a measure of that reflection, in the "backscattered"  direction. You may want to refer to some of the literature and  textbooks on the subject (e.g. Ulaby et al. 3 volume set on microwave scattering and emission). 12/ 6/95<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 181:<STRONG>      I understand that SAR requires coherent signal processing.  My question is:  Must the carrier be a coherent waveform or must only the modulation be coherent? 11/30/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>l131764@lfwc.lockheed.com</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>181-1</STRONG>     Errrm - Both! The "shape" or "rate of change of phase" of the waveform you  transmit must be known in order for you to build a "matched filter". This  can then be convolved with every pulse received to increase your range  resolution. This is all you need in a normal radar system but SAR works  slightly differently. In SAR you obtain high resolution in the "along-track" direction by building a matched filter of the phase you would expect to  recieve from a point on the ground and then convolving with the real data in *EXACTLY* the same way as in the range direction. so in answer to your question you need to have coherence *both* in your carrier and in your waveform. 12/ 4/95<ADDRESS>Darren Muff, Defence Research Agency, Malvern, UK, dgm@sar.dra.hmg.gb</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>181-2</STRONG>     Strictly speaking, that is not entirely correct since there have been SAR systems built using the so-call "coherent-on-receive" approach in which the phase of the stable frequency reference is sampled and stored at an arbitary "zero-reference" time within each transmission and this "random" phase is then removed from the measured phase on each signal return from the target area obtained from that pulsed transmission. Thus, SAR systems have been built using NON-COHERENT, but pulse-to-pulse stable, transmitters such as pulsed magnetrons) in conjunction with stable fixed frequency reference oscillators for the RF demodulation process. What is critical is that the stable frequency reference (or STALO) be a very stable and predictable frequency over the round trip radar signal round trip transit time since the phase of the return signal (relative to the phase of the transmitted signal) is what is used in the SAR system to determine the fractional wavelength changes in the radar slant range from pulse-to-pulse over the radar's synthetic aperture integration time.     12/21/95<ADDRESS>Dr. Marshall Greenspan, Westinghouse Norden Systems, greenspan@norden.com</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 177:<STRONG>      I am looking for information on the following proposed SAR satellites: Almaz II (Russian); PRIRODA (Russian); EOS-SAR (JPL); SAR-2000 (French); RADARSAT II (Canadian) and Envisat-1/ASAR (ESA). If Anyone has *any* information at all (No matter how trivial) then I would be pleased to hear from you. Pointers to the relevent papers would also be much appreciated. 11/27/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Darren Muff, Defence Research Agency, Malvern, UK., dgm@sar.dra.hmg.gb</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>177-1</STRONG>     Radarsat was covered in a recent AVIATION WEEK in October, I think. Will  repost if I can find my copy. Quite a bit of data and several contact names as I recall. 11/27/95<ADDRESS>Bill Reid, Battelle, wh_reid@ccmail.pnl.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>177-2</STRONG>     Radarsat II is proposed to be a carbon copy of Radarsat I with minimum design changes: i.e., faster, cheaper because design is finished.  Detailed info on Radarsat I is available in the Special Issue of the Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing Vol 19 No.4 Nov-Dec 93.  Possible changes for Radarsat II include GPS attitude determination and control (i.e., better position for interferometry) and digital vice tape deck for radar data.  Check the Radarsat home page at http://radarsat.space.gc.ca/ for additional info and contacts. 12/28/95<ADDRESS>M.C.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 173:<STRONG>      Given the current technology, is it possible to trace individual movements via your technology?  I was thinking of the crime scene of the O.J. Simpson murder on the night in question. If available, it would at least answer whether there  was only one perpretrator. 		 11/22/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>John Jasmin, Contractor:AT&T ME, Orlando,FL, orjmj@attme.cnet.att.com</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>173-1</STRONG>     no, for three reasons : 1) it would be difficult if not impossible to constantly image everywhere on earth (or even the state of California) continuously, process the data, and store it all so that you could go back and look it up - this is vastly beyond our current capability even for non-radar systems.2)  systems such as SIR-C do not have the resolution to detect objects smaller than about 10 meters square.  3) objects such as human beings would not have very bright radar signatures. 11/22/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>173-2</STRONG>     I disagree. There are unmistakeable images of Elvis in some of the earlier SIR-C imagery.  tom @ emerald 11/30/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>173-3</STRONG>     Probably not, although two possible sites for Jimmy Hoffa's burial site have been located through radar imaging of his dental records. 12/ 6/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 170:<STRONG>      I seem to have forgotten, does a 10 meter resolution allow for the detection of large ships (like supertankers and aircraft carriers)?  If this is possible has it been tried?  And are there plans for getting a higher resolution return? Thanks in advance.  		 11/16/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Steven J Forsberg, Arizona State University, aufsj@imap2.asu.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>170-1</STRONG>       The Nov 1995 issue of "Sea Technology" has an article entitled "High Seas Ship Surveillance via Radarsat", by Staples, et al, p59. 12/ 1/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>170-2</STRONG>     A friend of mine was quite recently just occasionally looking at a new ERS SAR image taken of the Gulf of Finland, when he noticed a long black stream going west from Helsinki.  He did send that image to the Finnish authorities, who could confirm that it was an oil-slick.  They even could locate and identify the tanker ship which has been washing out all the dirt from its tanks.  The responsible persons were sentenced. It's sad to note how many ships have been doing that!  On Mediterranean Sea these kind of spills can be seen every now and then, for example. 2/ 1/96<ADDRESS>teemu.tares@jrc.it</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>170-3</STRONG>     In general you must have a resolution of at least 1/2 the size of the object you want to sense (see). A resolution of 10 meters would allow you to sense an object twice that size and possibly determine what it is.` But, a ship on water is a perfect corner reflector --- so what is that bright spot on the dark water. Most any large ship,  iceberg,  island,  wave pattern, etc. 3/20/96<ADDRESS>Paul W.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 169:<STRONG>      This question concerns antenna gain.  What is the definition of "dBi"  as it relates to antenna gain?   I am familiar with dB gain.   11/13/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Tad M. Blanchard, National Health Services, Inc., Tad_Blanchard@ccmail.GSFC.NASA.gov</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>169-1</STRONG>     dBi refers to gain with respect to an isotropic antenna.  The mythical isotropic antenna radiates the input power in all directions equally well.  A directive antenna radiates x dB more power in a specific direction (often called boresight direction).  It thus radiates x dBi more power in that direction. Of course, the converse applies if the antenna is reciprocal i.e. it works as well on receive as transmit. One can of course become more exact and refer to Directivity and  directive gain, but that would possibly obscure this simplified answer.  There is an IEEE Standard which defines antenna terms.  11/15/95<ADDRESS>Michael Inggs, Dept Electricaal Eng, University Cape Town, mikings@eeleceng.uct.ac.za</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 167:<STRONG>      Hello? I'm a graduate student at POSTECH in Korea. I have been studying geometric correction of SAR images distorted by SAR imaging characteristics & terrain height. I have concluded that the following procedure is usually used ; location of image pixels, geocoding, mosaicking. In terms of an algorithm implementation, I have some questions. 1) In the location procedure, how can I get Doppler frequency of each pixel. 2) In the image rotation, the rotation angle is said to be determined by inclination of the obital plane & latitude of the scene center. What does incli- nation of the obital plane mean? 3) I want to know the format and the contents of platform ephemeris data and raw data hearder.  I'm sorry for my ignorance. I would appreciate your precious reply. 11/11/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Roh Shin Gyoon, roh@cafe.postech.ac.kr</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>167-1</STRONG>     First of all, we need to know which sensor your data are from.  For spaceborne platforms, JPL can provide header format info,  etc., for SIR-C/X-SAR, but you will have to contact the responsible  agency for other sensors, such as ERS-1, JERS, etc. Re: your  question (1): If you are working with correlated SAR image data,  the Doppler frequency of a given pixel is irrelevant to geometric  correction. Furthermore, in SAR, a given pixel has a different  Doppler frequency value for each "look". Question (2): The inclination  of the orbital plane is the angle of intersection between the  plane of the orbit and the Earth's equatorial plane. So a polar  orbiter would have an inclination of 90 degrees. Question (3):  If you can be more specific about the sensor, perhaps someone can  point you to the appropriate sources.  11/15/95<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>167-2</STRONG>     One of the people we have working here at JPL, Dr. Francesco Holecz, has been working on this problem for some time. You can contact him via e-mail at  franci@blacks.jpl.nasa.gov 2/11/96<ADDRESS>Tony Freeman, JPL</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 166:<STRONG>      I have a basic question about how radar interacts with the ground.  I know that as surface roughness increases, less radar energy is specularly re- flected and more is backscattered to the sensor.  Is it the same for soil moisture?  Specifically, as you reduce soil moisture, do you get more  specular reflection (I know less energy is scattered back to the sensor, but is this due solely to soil penetration?)?  Also, how would the response vary between HH and VV polarizations? 11/10/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>John Chadwick, chadwick@sensor.gsfc.nasa.gov</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>166-1</STRONG>     Please take a look at the July 1995 issue of IEEE transactions on Geoscience and Remote sensing (sirc/xsar special issue). There are some articles addressing your question there.  11/14/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>166-2</STRONG>     Here's a short answer: Dry soil has a lower dielectric constant than moist soil. Less energy is therefore reflected from dry soil, independent of direction (e.g., specular or backscatter). Of course less reflection is equivalent to more transmission  (soil penetration). Surface roughness is the dominant control  on the relative strength of specular and backscattered reflections.  As described in the paper by Dubois et al. in the IEEE issue that  Bruce mentions, as soil moisture increases, VV backscatter is enhanced relative to HH.  11/15/95<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>166-3</STRONG>     Take a look too in the book 'Remote sensing and image interpretation' third edition by Lillesand and Kiefer, chapter 8. Or in 'Theoretical study of the sensitivity of the microwave backscattering coefficient to the soil surface parameters' by Autret,Bernard and Vidal-Madjar,1989,Int.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 161:<STRONG>      Two questions about SIR-C survey images. 1) How are the different polarizations combined to produce one image? 2) In converting from slant-range to ground range, is elevation taken into consideration?  If it is not, is this equivalent to assuming that the ground is flat?  I would be interested in any references on how to correct for this or any other distortions in order to get a more orthographic image.  11/ 6/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>David Oliver, Rocky Mountain Nasa Space Grant Consortium, doliver@sysdiv.sdl.usu.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>161-1</STRONG>     1)  The survey images are just one polarization (usually Horizontally polarized for both  transmit and receive), and also just one wavelength (usually L-band).  This is how the survey data is processed.  It is only when the data is "precision" processed, that we get images of all polarizations and wavelengths.  2)  elevation is not taken into account when converting from slant range to ground range, usually.  This is because for many sites we don't know the elevations accurately enough.  Also, it is a lot of work to co-register the data with the DEM's. However, the most significant effect of not accounting for elevations is calibration errors.  Yes, it is equivalent to assuming that the Earth is flat.  There are several papers published about resulting calibration errors - check IEEE geo. and  rem. sensing.  I am not sure how large the distortions are.  11/ 7/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 159:<STRONG>      I have heard of "microradar" that might be useful for navigational purposes by blind persons. Does anyone know where I can find such information? Thanks! 11/ 3/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Mike Corbett, NC Division of Services for the Blind, Mikeeta@aol.com</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>159-1</STRONG>     Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is developing products that use GPS to give continuing locations on a (visual) map overlay. I don't see why it could not be coupled to a oral readout, but development would be required. This might be useful for people following regular, urban routes. Radar is a logical  next step, but I don't have immediate info on that. I can point you to the GPS people. Bill 11/ 8/95<ADDRESS>William H. Reid, Battelle PNL, wh_reid@ccmail.pnl.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>159-2</STRONG>     There are very small and cheap ($30-50) hand-held ultra-sound distance measurement equipments available.  They are used in building construction work, for example (at least in Finland).  It immediately gives you the distance from the target pointed, with an accuracy of few centimeters up to distances about 20 meters.  This + DGPS would be a good solution, GPS giving the location on map and ultra-sound probe giving the idea of obstacles near you.  2/ 1/96<ADDRESS>teemu.tares@jrc.it</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 157:<STRONG>      I want to know if airborne SAR is an appropriate technology for the location of buried ordinance, specifically on the Island of Kahoolawe Hawaii ? 10/26/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Charles Busby, CHARLES M. BUSBY P.E., cbusby@aloha.net</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>157-1</STRONG>     Very much doubt it.  If the ordnance is metallic, I think your best bet is metal detector technology: this has been brought to a fine art by many companies throughout the world.  One of the most practical systems is marketed by Barcom of South Africa.  However, this is all stuff  which operates on the surface. There is also a great deal of work relating to using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) for this purpose.  However, GPR is limited by soil conductivity.  Wet clay will restrict penetration to a few cm! There has been some work using high resoltion airborne SAR which has located metallic mines in **very** ideal conditions.  There was a recent SPIE conference on this topic: the proceedings would be a good departure point. 11/15/95<ADDRESS>Michael Inggs, Dept Electrical Eng, University of Cape Town, mikings@eleceng.uct.ac.za</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>157-2</STRONG>     Also see the responses the Question 150. 11/16/95<ADDRESS>Ellen O'Leary, JPL Radar Data Center</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>157-3</STRONG>     GPR might work at lower frequencies (10 MHz)... big antenna though.  SAR might detect an area of disturbed soil if the dielectric constant vaires greatly with the undisturbed area.  Also the disturbed area would have to be rather large > 20m2  3/15/96<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 152:<STRONG>      1.  Is it feasible to place imaging radar technology onboard Airships? 2.  Could you see its application in these platforms in such areas as coastal surveillance, artic surveillance, pollution monitoring and drug interdiction? 3.  What sort of telemetry/communications system is required to link the information from these systems to shore based monitoring stations? 4.  Is the cost of this technology comparable to synthetic aperature radars, phased array or conventional radar systems?  10/22/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>LCdr Peter P. Southam, Canadian Forces Command and Staff College Toronto Ontario, psouthm@io.org</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>152-1</STRONG>     Aviation Week and Sapce Technology for October 23rd, 1995 (page 37+) describes the Canadian RadarSat satellite. That could give you baseline numbers for the  applications you describe. You questions would take a lot of time to answer, however. You could also look at the tethered balloons on the U.S.-Mexico border to learn of those costs (U.S. Customs, I assume).  Bill 11/ 8/95<ADDRESS>William Reid, Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, wh_reid@ccmail.pnl.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>152-2</STRONG>     I assume that your question was with respect to "airships (blimps).  The answer is yes, a blimp can be used as a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to monitor slow moving objects or survey fixed point targets.  However, the radar/target have to move relative to each other in order to use SAR processing.  For a "real beam" radar, the balloons (run by DEA) down at Fort Huachuca, Arizona are a practical example of their use in border surveillance. For SAR, either the blimp would have to move, the target would have to move or... have the radar "dangle in a circle" below the blimp !  5/ 6/96<ADDRESS>Joe Arnold, Lockheed Martin - Tactical Systems Division, AZ, 70250.222@compuserve.com</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 150:<STRONG>      Having noted a number of editorials on the need to conduct post-war mine  removal, I was wondering whether airborne or space based SAR could  contribute to assisting with this problem. Mine filelds could be in any  type of terrain, including under forest caopies.  10/20/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Joe Nicholas, jpnicholas@tasc.com</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>150-1</STRONG>     it is possible... 10/24/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>150-2</STRONG>     ..one major problem is many modern mines are made from plastics, cerams etc, ie: "*hard* to detect" materials, as they are designed to *avoid* detection  when deployed. Norw. mine removal aid organizations tend to prefer the  proven good old bayonet when searching and recovering/removing them.  A more brutal and effective approach is a recent innovation involving a  modified tank used to trigger the mines explosive charges by using a giant "steel brush" to carve up the soil in which the mines buried/deployed. 10/27/95<ADDRESS>Arnt Karlsen, none, arnt@hsr.no</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>150-3</STRONG>     There are as many technologies needed for UXO (as some say for unexploded ordnance) as there are devices out there.  While many recent mine fields have largely non-metallic devices, there are many, many other situations where there are metallic ordnance. Recently in France unexploded gas shells from  World War I have been corroding through and realeasing still-active mustards, etc.  In the US mustards in glass vials have recently been excavated from a military dump that was unrecorded. One estimate to clean up this stuff in the US runs to $18 billion--and that leaves out the millions of acres of foreign lands. I am sure that radar--and other electromagnetic approaches-- will have a significant role in the future. That radar may be in a plane  doing a local, high-resolution search, or even on the ground searching an immediate area. Those guys with the bayonets have a hard, hard life. In Africa some are paying a bounty for each device--with no workman's compensation. The UN has, I'm told, used peacekeeping soldiers for such work to open roads. Talk about dedication! 11/ 8/95<ADDRESS>William H.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 143:<STRONG>      Does anyone have any information on the success of ground penetration by the  radar signal, eg. for detection of archaeological remains.  Where can this type of processing be carried out ? 10/10/95</STRONG><ADDRESS></ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>143-1</STRONG>     We are developing an L-band Spatial/Spectral sensor for application to archeology.  The present sensor detects planar surfaces to an accuracy  of better than 1' in 10 feet and has been tested in mines to measure coal and rock thickness and distance between tunnels.  The dielectric conatent need not be known before hand as the sensor measures the electrical parameters as well  as the loss and thickness.  A 3-D version is now in the works for combining AZ  and EL info with the distance info. I am interested in antenna technology for  broadband antennas with stable phase centers with frequency. 10/11/95<ADDRESS>Bob Chufo, bob@silver.usbm.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>143-2</STRONG>     There was an article in the Feb. 1995 issue of Science on p. 965 about how SIR -C/X- SAR was used to image the remains of Angkor Wat in Cambodia. 11/29/95<ADDRESS>Nirmal Keshava, keshava@ece.cmu.edu</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>143-3</STRONG>     I know one of the world's experts on ground penetrating radar. He was employed  by the Stanford Research Institute Geophysical Sciences Division, but is now an independent consultant.

Neither ERS-1 nor JERS-1 are side looking radar, which I assume is what you mean by "Side Scanning Radar"; they are synthetic aperture radar systems.  To find out the JERS-1 data available of Antarctica, attempt to navigate the system at NASDA.  Telnet to 133.56.72.1, and use the username of NASDADIR. There is a minor bug when attempting to find imagery around the 180 degree longitude mark, but it is otherwise a useful system. 11/ 4/95<ADDRESS>Stephen McNeill, Landcare Research New Zealand, mcneills@landcare.cri.nz</ADDRESS>

There is a thread on the net for recently declassified satellite imagery available for purchase from the federal government. Whether it covers the area you're interested in cannot be determined until you contact them.  Certainly, there is LANDSAT/ERTS imagery of the area, as well as the opportunity to purchase recent SPOT imagery.  JPL can probably tell you if there has been any SAR imagery in that area:  there is also the data on  the net that shows approximately where the SIR-C imagery was acquired.      There are other sources of imagery as well.  The Forestry Service has mapped most of the natural forest reserves of the United States from time to time, and may have  imagery.  The USGS has mapping imagery, but the exact date may not fit your parameters.  In addition, there are dozens of private aerial imaging firms that have acquired proprietary data, and some of it may cover the area you're discussing.  I would check with the University of Alaska and the State of Alaska.  Either or both may have the kind of imagery, as well as other data, that will meet your needs. 10/ 5/95<ADDRESS>Mike Weatherford, Weatherford Enterprises, mweather@rmii.com</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 135:<STRONG>      I would like to be able to use radar to image the wall of an open pit  mine.  Once a base image is established, movement on the wall could be determined by comparing subsequent images of the wall.  The general  parameters for this project are up to a one mile range with accuracy of approximately 0.02 feet of movement.  If anyone has any information that would help me develop this project I would certainly appreciate a reply. Thanks! 9/30/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Richmond Fenn, richf@cu.cyprus.com</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>135-1</STRONG>     An imaging radar may not be the best tool for this job. If you really need to image the wall, you might consider a fixed stereo-photographic system. These are commercially available, in fact you could probably have a company that specializes in photogrammetry do the whole project for you.   If you don't need an image, an even easier way would be to mount a few special corner-cube reflectors on the wall and periodically measure their position very accurately with a laser ranger.  10/ 5/95<ADDRESS>Tom Farr, JPL, tom.farr@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>135-2</STRONG>     We have field tested a Spatial/Spectral L-band sensor that measures coal and  rock thickness in undergrond and surface mines.  The dielectric constant is measured on the fly and need not be known or guessed at beforehand.  The sensor is accurate to within 1" in 10 feet.  We are now developing a 3-D version for visualizing hazards in advance of mining such as fractures or water or gas  filled voids.  Archeological exploration is another interest. 10/11/95<ADDRESS>Bob Chufo, bob@silver.usbm.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 132:<STRONG>      I am interested in getting a copy of the Los Angeles image (Radar and others). I attempted to download it using Netscape, but after 12 hours, I had 7 of the  38 megabytes, so it obviously isn't going to get the job done.  Is there a CD-ROM published with these images?  If so, where and how much? I have heard there is a CD-ROM mapping product that will show aerial images and overlay street maps on it.  Do you know what that is called?  Thanks  9/29/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Hugh Hemington, Systems Analyst, Great Western Bank, hughem@pacificnet.net</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>132-1</STRONG>     The problem is that you are trying to download the full resolution version of the image.  if you go to the <a href ="/pic.html">the picture gallery</a> most of the images are only a couple hundred K bytes.<p> We don't currently have a cd-rom of the publicly released images.However, the <a href="/education.html">education cd-rom</a> has many of these images on it, and should be out shortly (it is being pressed right now).  Even so, this cd-rom does not have the full resolution byte images on it.</p>  9/29/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>132-2</STRONG>     I would like full resolution images, but (even with hard drive cache off) Netscape cannot download more than 5MB before degenerating into a drive-scrubbing mess.  In order to see any real detail, I need more than the x-hundred K version, and  there is no CD-ROM or other media in distribution.  How about FTP?  I still  have a shell account elsewhere.  If I could get it down to my provider, possibly Procomm could retrieve it intact.  Otherwise, I suppose only users with direct connection to the Internet are able to get these images, which would exclude probably most Internet users.  Thanks 9/30/95<ADDRESS>Hugh Hemington, hughem@north.pacificnet.net</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>132-3</STRONG>     You can also get a hard copy of the image in a variety of photo products by contacting Newell Color:  221 North Westmoreland, Los Angeles, CA 90064-4892.  Tel. (213) 380-2980 ext. 269; fax (213) 739-6984.  Provide them with the "P number" (found in each caption file) and they can get you a copy of the image. 10/ 2/95<ADDRESS>Ellen O'Leary, JPL, ellen.oleary@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>132-4</STRONG>     The full-res files you are trying to access reside at an ftp site. Note the URL before you download in Netscape. You will see that is actually a pointer to the ftp image archive site here at JPL (ftp.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/images). 10/ 2/95<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Experiment Scientist, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>132-5</STRONG>     It is false that Netscape is limited to 5 megs.  I routinely download 8 meg files in an hour over a 28.8 modem.  FTP files can be obtained more rapidly and conveniently using the freeware 'Anarchie'.  Tom @ emerald 10/18/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 130:<STRONG>      I would like to know if this type of imaging can penetrate sea water, and if so to what depth?  Also, are there any scans on-line for the FAMOUS (Deep Sea Drilling Project) area on the mid-Atlantic ridge or for the Straits of Florida? Thanks to whoever can respond. 9/26/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Mark Hammons, University of Minnesota, m-hamm@maroon.tc.umn.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>130-1</STRONG>     All radar waves will penetrate seawater, more or less.  There are several factors involved:  the salinity of the water, other dissolved chemicals, plant and/or animal life (especially plankton), temperature, etc. Radar will penetrate from about one meter to more than 15 meters, depending on conditions, angle if incidence, frequency, etc.  Most technical libraries could give you the appropriate data.  9/26/95<ADDRESS>Mike Weatherford, Weatherford Enterprises, mweather@rmii.com</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>130-2</STRONG>     Actually, radar waves do NOT penetrate  bodies of water - the radio waves reflects off the surface.  Perhaps the above user was thinking of optical remote sensing data.  It is true that radar waves can penetrate some ice sheets, the amount of penetration a function of the wavelength of the radio waves, the salinity of the ice, water content, etc. 9/29/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>130-3</STRONG>     Sorry, Bruce.  I've personally seen radar penetrations of coastal estuaries where reflections have been  returned from depths of six to ten feet from the surface.  While in most cases, radar waves are either defracted,  deflected, or absorbed by bodies of water, penetration of a translucent body by high-energy waves is nothing new. The reflections must be from objects that lie no deeper than 1/4 the width of the radar receiver/antenna (either  physical or virtual), and are usually only returned from clear, non-turbulent flow.  Sediments, dissolved, chemicals, zoological content, etc, can also affect 'viewing', but as the people from George Washington University showed us in 1985, RADAR WILL, under the proper conditions, reflect from objects under layers of water.      As for Radar reflecting from water, this usually only occurs when there is something else in the water (sediments, etc,) or the water is highly turbulent and the radar waves reflect from the surface of the wave front, etc.  Most radar energy  is absorbed or diffracted, which gives us the nice, dark 'no return zones' we record from rivers, lakes, and similar areas! Mike Weatherford, mweather@rmii.com  9/29/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>130-4</STRONG>     Radio waves will reflect off the surface of the water, and penetration below the surface will be extremely small.  This can be seen when looking at images with bridges - you will see the effect of multiple reflections off the bridge due to some reflections bouncing off the water AND the bridge.  In addition, returns when looking straight down over water are very strong.  Also, the dielectric  constant of seawater is very high, making the water a conductor to the radio waves.  It may be true that effects on the surface of the water may indicate subsurface features. 10/ 2/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>130-5</STRONG>     Mark, Several corporations are now performing research and development  activities which are related to both radar & infrared subsurface imaging. Most of the interested parties proposed applications are in the area of Airborne Mine Hunting/Warfare.  If you have ideas for commercial applications of this type of technology, especially in the areas of oil/gas exploration and or mining I would love to hear them. 10/ 2/95<ADDRESS>Mark Bonatucci, Loral Defense Systems-East, bonatum@GN.unisysgsg.com</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>130-6</STRONG>     Perhaps there is another range of the EM spectrum that would be more conducive to penetrating sea water at greater depths?  Mark 10/ 4/95<ADDRESS>Mark Hammons, University of Minnesota Libraries, m-hamm@maroon.tc.umn.edu</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>130-7</STRONG>     The above discussions address the issue but have not really answered the  whole question. This SAR will not penetrate the ocean surface to any  significant depth (a few centimeters) and it will not image the deep  sea drilling sites.  It is well known however that SAR can detect surface manifestations of below surface bathymetric features relating to alterations of ocean current patterns and other features such as internal waves. So the last question concerning the Straits of Florida is " maybe".  Well known examples of SAR imaging of bathymetric features are sand bars in the English Channel and the Nantucket Shoals, plus some river deltas.  Also investigators have used surface expressions of internal waves to infer the presence of seamounts etc.  I believe the above discussions do relate very much to frequency and salinity. 10/ 5/95<ADDRESS>Ben Holt, JPL, ben@pacific.jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>130-8</STRONG>     Great answer, BEN!  True, the SAR imagery used by most imaging radar systems will not penetrate seawater (or any water) to any great extent.  Yet the one reason RADAR is such a valuable imaging tool is that it will penterate most clouds (suspended droplets of water).   As a 25-year veteran analyst, well-exposed to all types of imagery, I've seen regular black and white photography that also penetrates haze that color imagery would not, and vice versa.  There are a number of technical problems, but mostly, all energy used for imaging purposes responds four ways to a surface:  reflection, refraction, diffusion, and absorbtion.  Most imaging systems do not work well in deep water:  even light is absorbed after about 200 feet, even in the clearest water, with the blues fading first, then the greens, yellows, etc., until only the reds remain.  The same is true of radar, whether it's the SIR-C, SR-71 HRR, or the latest research imaging system.  Frequency, polarity, angle of incidence, turbidity, dissolved minerals, plant and animal life, will all affect those four functions affect the energy  that strikes the surface.  Deep-sea imaging would best be done using a SONAR array.  As I stated in my first post, RADAR waves will penetrate about 12 meters under ideal conditions - that includes the most water-transparent frequency, the optimum angle of incidence, clear,  calm water, and a dozen other factors.  The resolution of the resulting imagery will not be optimum, but can be - and has been - used to measure gradients of beaches, location and dimensions of underwater obstacles, etc.      On a similar vein, I have studied a number of the images used to detect subsurface anomalies based on changes to surface wave patterns - fascinating field, and I wish I had more opportunity to explore it.  Still, it wouldn't be a lot of good for undersea mining,  treasure detection, etc., as the resolution is in the dozens of feet!    I've enjoyed this exchange of ideas - I haven't thought this much about imagery in several years. Mike Weatherford  10/ 5/95<ADDRESS>Mike Weatherford, Weatherford Enterprises, mweather@rmii.com</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>130-9</STRONG>     A little logic may help here.... if electromagnetic waves, i.e., RADAR, could propagate to any significant distance in water, then submarines would have an easy means of communication under water. Most people know that subs must surface to get radio signals, and why use SONAR if you could just stick an antenna on your sub and use it to take soundings, etc. with RADAR? I think the bottom line is EMR is nicely absorbed by water, maybe DI water is different (anybody know?). 10/26/95<ADDRESS>Kevin Duemmel, OSU Astronomical Instrumentation Facility, duemmel@mps.ohio-state.EDU</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>130-10</STRONG>     Yes, this can be confusing, sometimes!  We used to measure forests with a 5.3GHz (C-band) CW-FM radar horizontally from the top of a Jeep in Finland.  Even there the penetration depth could be as few as two meters in a bush, but nevertheless we could see targets in a distance of more than 50 meters.  This was because the penetration depth is defined to be the depth where the power has dropped to its 1/e th part (i.e. about 4dB), and we had a dynamic range of more than 60dB.  But, in water the penetration depth in that frequency (without doing any accurate calculations) is certainly not very much more than couples of millimeters, which of course does not mean that radio waves couldn't be detected in a depth of 10m, although the power would be so low that no-one can measure it! 2/ 1/96<ADDRESS>teemu.tares@jrc.it</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>130-11</STRONG>     So who's right? 6/17/96<ADDRESS>ARB</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 129:<STRONG>      Hello; I have a student who has a question I cannot begin to answer. If you could help him out I would appreciate it. I will let him type the question in. Dear NAS, I have heard NASA scientists saying that they plan to terra form Mars by pumping gases into its  atmosphere, like CO2 to worm the planet..  But when Mars had an atmosphere before and it wass maintained by volcanoes pumping necessary gases into the Marsion atmosphere.  Then when the volcanic activity stoped, the planet lost its atmosphere to space.  So the planets gravity was too weak to hold on to any life sustaining atmosphere.  Doesn't that mean you can not terra form Mars?  Mars's gravity is just too weak.  Also, please don't give me an explenation on how you plan to terra form Mars.  Just please tell me how do you plan to keep in the gases you pump out from being lost in space from Mars's weak gravity? 9/25/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>L Eynon, El Dorado hs, eyno7000@spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>129-1</STRONG>     There are several ways to terraform Mars, all expensive and difficult.  In my opinion, the best, cheapest, and most likely to work would be to move some of the millions of bits of material already in space near mars - the Asteroids - into a collision with the planet.  This is especially true of water (frozen ice), gasses (also frozen), and large chunks of rock containing essential ores.  The process would be long - taking hundreds of years, rather than a few, but basically a recompilation of the planet into something more resembling Earth.  There is obviously enough material in orbit, the added mass would increase the gravitational attraction of the surface of Mars (although marginally at first - it would build up over time), and would ensure the planet had an abundance of natural resources that could be exploited in (relative) comfort by later colonists.  9/26/95<ADDRESS>Mike Weatherford, Weatherford Enterprises, mweather@rmii.com</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>129-2</STRONG>     First of all, this is probably not the best forum for discussion of this topic (terraforming Mars has little to do with imaging radar). You might have better luck stimulating discussion on a usenet newsgroup, such as sci.space.  Having said that, I will take a stab at your question. Mars currently has a thin atmosphere. However, this is not a result of  the planet's low gravity, but has to to do with the current location of  potential atmospheric constituents (mostly carbon dioxide and water).  It is  thought that the near-surface soils and rocks, and the polar caps, contain  enough of these gases (now in solid form) to make up a much denser atmosphere  that the current one.  If conditions were warmer, much of these gases would  be released, which would further enhance "greenhouse" warming.  As for  terraforming, this is more a topic for science fiction than for the NASA  planetary program.  NASA plans to send a series of orbiting and landing  probes to Mars over the next decade, but none of these instruments are intended  to terraform the planet.  9/28/95<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, JPL Geophysics and Planetary Geology Group, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 125:<STRONG>      I'm looking for information on DEM extraction from AIRBORNE RADAR using either  interferometry or overlapping techniques.   Which is the preferred method?  What systems have been developed?  What  software is available? 9/19/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Andrew Dyk, Geomatics International, andrew@geomatics.com</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>125-1</STRONG>     I assume by "overlapping techniques" you mean using stereo radar image  pairs.  If so, the answer to your question is, interferometry is the  preferred method.  Interferometry provides better height accuracy, does not  require that the scene contain matchable features as stereo does, can be acquired by a single pass of a dual-antenna aircraft, and is much cheaper  and quicker to process than stereo pairs.  See the TOPSAR area of this site  for examples of the JPL aircraft interferometry data  (http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/airsar/topsar/).  I believe that some of the  European agencies are also developing airborne systems, although I don't have  details.  As for software, DEM extraction from interferometry data is an  evolving technique, so most of the software tools are still in development  at institutions such as JPL.  You can expect some commercial tools to come  out in the next few years.  As for stereo-DEM generation, Vexcel Corporation  in Denver has developed a package for exracting DEMs from Magellan stereo  radar data of Venus, and they have other tools for terrestrial radar that  may be available for purchase. 9/28/95<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, JPL, SIR-C Experiment Scientist, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

From there, the rest is up to you, to determine the lat/lon of any given pixel.  There are several map  projection software packages (such as USGS's "PICS") that allow you to label  digital image files with corner points, scale, etc., and you can then extract  lat/lons.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 116:<STRONG>      I am a grad student relatively new to SAR research, so I apologize in advance if this is an ignorant question.  My only experience with SAR imagery is over  land, (esp. wetlands).  In some cases I have found strong sigma0-VV responses over wetlands at large incidence (~40°).  I thought this may be due to vertically oriented vegetation growth until I saw the same strong sigma0-VV at large incidence over open ocean.  I expected calm ocean to be nearly specular, with sigma0-VV roughly equal to sigma0-HH.  I thought my image might simply be a special case with waves oriented to produce the strong sigma0-VV until I noticed that in some references, (Ulaby, Moore, Fung, Microwave Remote  Sensing..., vol. 2) that sigma0-VV is predicted to be stronger than sigma0-HH at large incidence over ocean.  In this reference, nothing was mentioned about a particular wave orientation.  So what is responsible for the sigma0-VV  response that I get over the ocean?    9/ 6/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Clint Slatton, University of Texas at Austin, slatton@poseidon.csr.utexas.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>116-1</STRONG>     Here's a possible, simple explanation for what you are seeing: the Fresnel  reflection coefficients, which describe reflection of electromagnetic  radiation across a boundary between two media of different refractive indices (or dielectric constants), can be used to predict backscatter as  a function of polarization and incidence angle.  A result of the application  of these coefficients, which appears in most radar scattering models, is that  backscatter at VV polarization does not fall off as rapidly with increasing  incidence angle as does backscatter at HH polarization.  At large incidence  angles (>40 deg), this effect is commonly observed, even on relatively smmoth  surfaces such as a calm ocean. 9/ 7/95<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, JPL, SIR-C Project, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 115:<STRONG>      can anyone tell me what a "SATURATED ADIABATIC LAPSE RATE" is? I believe  it is an aviation term. 9/ 2/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>TODD IN BRISBANE</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>115-1</STRONG>     This is the adiabatic lapse rate for an atmosphere saturated with water.  Lapse rate refers to the drop in temperature with altitude in the troposphere (the region from the surface to about 10 or 15 km altitude).  Adiabatic refers to  the drop in temperature with altitude, for the case in which no heat is lost or gained by the atmosphere.  As air rises, it expands and cools.  As dry air  rises, it cools at a rate which is equal to the acceleration of gravity divided by the heat capacity of the air (9.8 m/s^2  /  1000 J/kg/K).  See K.N.Liou,  1992, Radiation and cloud processes in the  Atmosphere, Oxford Press, page 453 (see also p.244 & 360).  The adiabatic lapse rate for moist air is less  (typically 6.5 K/km) than that for dry air (9.8K/km) because when it expands, and cools, water condenses.  This condensation process releases heat which  decreases the rate at which the air cools. 9/ 3/95<ADDRESS>Joy Crisp, JPL, joy@glassy.jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 114:<STRONG>      Hi, I have a small question about the resolution of ERS-1 SAR images. What is the difference between the pixel spacing and the resolution of  the images.  For exemple the full-resolution ERS-1 images has a pixel- spacing equal to 12.5m and a resolution of 30m. Should these two values be the same and which one gives me the ground dimension of each pixel  (in order to get some measures of ground features).   	Thank you very much for your help.   8/31/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Luc Chouinard, McGill University, chouinar@alpha.civil.mcgill.ca</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>114-1</STRONG>     The pixel spacing is the size of each pixel.  This is the quantity that you would use to determine distances within the image.  The resolution is typically about a factor of two worse than the pixel spacings, because usually you want to sample the data (see nyquist theorem) to retain as much information as possible. 8/31/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 112:<STRONG>      I have been studying the Kliuchevskoi Volcano optical radar comparison and cannot work out why the snow is so red i.e. gives such high backscatter in the L-band, HH polarisation. Can someone help me ? 8/31/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Mark Mostert, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, markmost@l.kth.se</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>112-1</STRONG>     The areas appearing red on the Kliuchevskoi image do not have especially high backscatter in LHH. Instead, they appear red because they have very LOW backscatter in the other two color channels, which are LHV (green) and CHV (blue).  The "red" areas apparently do not have many roughness elements,  such as vegetation or rough rock, that usually give high backscatter in the cross-polarization (HV).

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 111:<STRONG>      Where can I get information about the data processing algorithms that were used for SIR-C/X-SAR data? 8/28/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Anita Mogili, Remote Sensing Lab, Univ of Kansas, mogili@rsl.ukans.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>111-1</STRONG>     SIR-C data is processed using well known range-doppler algorithms as described in most SAR textbooks. Here are a couple of recommendations:  Spaceborne Radar Remote Sensing: Applications and Techniques by Charles Elachi (IEEE Press) Ch 1-5  Synthetic Aperture Radar Systems and Signal Processing by John C. Curlander and Robert N. McDonough (Wiley-Interscience)  There is no published SIR-C specific material that I know of that covers data processing. There is an internal JPL document, "Shuttle Imaging Radar-C Ground Data Processing System Processing Algorithm Design Document" that lists the principal equations used. It can be ordered through JPL by calling (818) 354-5091 and specifying document # D-7194. It's terse and out of date (written in 1991), but most of its contents still applies. Up-to-date information on the entire processor is scattered through hundreds of internal memos and documents. I can't recommend any of them without a more specific question. 9/ 1/95<ADDRESS>Jeff Levison, jpl, jeff.levison@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

Without a known point object in the scene, it may be difficult to measure the  resolution of the data - but generally the spatial resolution is well known. 8/31/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>110-2</STRONG>     Radiometric resolution of a SAR system is a measure of the ability of the system to distinguish between uniform regions with a different backscatter levels. 9/15/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 108:<STRONG>      I am researching CIVIL WAR entrenchments in Virginia. I've heard that aerial radar is helpful in identifing this type of feature which is no longer visible from the surface due to farming etc. How can I find appropriate images for my search area if they are available. 8/18/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Greg Boles, NISE EAST DET NORFOLK, G_BOLES@NISE-P.NOSC.MIL</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>108-1</STRONG>     Depending on how deep these are they may or may not show up on radar.  However, I suggest that you join our outreach program which is described elsewhere on this page.  Through the outreach program we will determine if your sites were covered with the shuttle radar and we can also process some data for you.  Please let me know if you have further questions. 8/18/95<ADDRESS>Ellen O'Leary, JPL, ellen.oleary@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<STRONG>108-4</STRONG>     The average depth of completed entrenchments is 8 ft. However they would range from 6 ft.- 14ft. in depth depending upon how long the troops had to prepare the position and how severe the firing. Generally if a 5 ft. deep trench was dug the removed earth would create the total 8-9 ft. deep earthwork. 8/29/95<ADDRESS>Greg Boles, NISE EAST DET. NORFOLK, g_boles@nise-p.nosc.mil</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 106:<STRONG>      I am looking for information on how satellite SAR radars use on-board  chirp-based, or white-noise-based, test signals to characterize the  satellite receive chain for data calibration purposes. 8/16/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Steve Spenler, sspenler@hookup.net</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>106-1</STRONG>     White receiver thermal noise is generally adjusted to desired levels in radar: too much results in loss of image clarity; too little allows other noise sources (possibly colored, or worse) to dominate signal processing, which can lead to some distortion or complete loss of the  image. Noise test signals are often used to sense and adjust the noise background to optimum. The Chirp signal (which is only one of the  possible modulations SAR systems may employ) represents the transmit  signal and, after reflection from the surface, the image signal presented to the receiver prior to processing. Receiver timing mismatches may bias the interpreted down-range position of the image. Likewise, degraded phase references may impose many of several degradations, depending on how the signal is processed. DC bias, where some artificial source of energy attaches to the signal, can also take away substantially from the image quality. Reference transmit signals (Chirp, in your instance) may be used to detect and help correct marginal imbalances as such. It should be noted that self-calibration is often a periodic function performed on SAR systems, owing to the especially demanding requirements on SAR signal, and signal processing, fidelity; certainly demanding as compared to other types of radar. 8/22/95<ADDRESS>Richard M.

The depth of sensing depends on the frequency with the longer wavelengths  penetrating deeper.  Two inversions methods have been proposed, They both apply to bare surfaces. Oh et. al., "An empirical model and Inversion technique for Radar scattering from bare surfaces",IEEE TGARS, vol.GE-30,1992, pp370-381 and Dubois, P. et. al.,"Measuring Soil Moisture with Imaging Radars", in Press in IEEE  TGARS, SIR-C Special Issue (announced for July). Futhermore, you should check the proceedings of IGARRS'94,IEEE catalog Number 94CH3378-7  where many papers were presented describing the use of neural nets to invert  soil moisture from SAR data.        The sub-surface soil moisture profile is of great interest ot many applications.  Severals papers have been published describing how to estimate the profile by  knowing only the surface value:  Entekhabu et. al., "Retrieval of Soil Moisture Profile by combined remote sensing  and modeling", ESA/NASA International woprkshop on passive Microwave remote sensing  research related to land-atmosphere interactions", St Lary, France, Jan.11-15, 1993  Jackson T. et. al., "Profile soil mositure from surface measurements," J irrig  Drain div ASCE, vol. 106(IR2), pp81-92, 1980  If you need further information, please contact me at pascale@blacks.jpl.nasa.gov   ~  8/10/95<ADDRESS>Pascale Dubois, JPL, pascale@blacks.jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 99:<STRONG>      I'm graduating at the University of Catania (Italy). Does anyone know how i can obtain the interferometric fringes from two (complex) data sets of the same place taken with tree days of difference? 8/ 7/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Alfio Finocchiaro, Facolta' di Ingegneria (University of Catania), alfio@indy.iit.unict.it</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>99-1</STRONG>       First, you need to make sure that the two datasets are possible to form an interferogram. This requires that they were collected with the same imaging geometry (incidence angle, look direction, etc.) from locations that are not too far apart (something like 100-1000m between the two  satellite locations which depends on the relief of the terrain and the radar wavelength). Then the images must have been processed in a way to make them compatible (all the same processing parameters, including Doppler Centroid) to produce Single Look Complex (SLC) images.    Second, you need to precisely co-register the two images (to less than a pixel) and then determine the phase angle between the complex data for each pixel. If all of this has been done correctly, then you should have  interferometric fringes! 8/10/95<ADDRESS>Eric Fielding, JPL Earth Sciences, Eric.Fielding@JPL.NASA.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>99-2</STRONG>     Check out the technical papers on SAR  interferometry and the EarthView Interferometry  SAR Workstation on Atlantis Scientific's web site  (http://www.atlsci.com). The EarthView InSAR Workstation is being released in July of 96.  If you get Earth Observation Magazine, there is an article on InSAR in the April 96 issue called "Mapping a Broken Land" and a complementary article on SAR Processing in the March issue. 5/ 7/96<ADDRESS>Gord Bowman, Atlantis Scientific Systems Group, Inc.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 98:<STRONG>      We want to calibrate P-band, JPL AIRSAR data, processed by processor version 3.55 and 3.56 (acquired in 1991 and 1990 respectively over Reynolds Creek,  Boise, Idaho). We have already calibrated C & L band using corner reflectors  (CR) in POLCAL 4.0. But CR technique can not applied to P band. We have  calibrated P band data of 1989 JPL AIRSAR data, processed by processor 2.1,  using auto calibration in POLCAL 4.0. POLCAL does not support auto cal for  data processed other than processor 2.1. Has anybody tried calibration of P-band?  8/ 5/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Sudhir Kumar Goyal, Graduate Student, Univ. of Idaho, working for USDA-ARS, Boise, sgoyal@nwrc.ars.pn.usbr.gov</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>98-1</STRONG>     All the data processed by the 3.5+ airsar processor should already be calibrated, but of course it is nice to verify the calibration with measurements of corner reflectors.  The way P-band calibration is verified is with corner reflectors in the Rosamond Dry Lake bed, the same ones that are used for L-band and C-band calibration.  You might want to contact Leon Maldonado if you have more questions at leon@blacks.jpl.nasa.gov.  8/ 7/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 92:<STRONG>      I'm a UC Davis water management specialist working on something called regulated deficit irrigation.  It's the practice of purposely depriving plants of water during stress-tolerant periods in order to save water while possibly enhancing some aspect of production.  For example, we identified that mild stress during late July in almond can reduce the incidence of hull rot fungus. I have 3 experimental field sites in the San Joaquin Valley where different irrigation treatments result in tree water stress.  We are monitoring this stress from the ground with leaf/stem water potential and stomatal conductance measurements.  I would like to see if these stresses express themselves in  something that can be remotely sensed.  I've tried using hand-held infrared thermometers from 12 ft ladders to monitor canopy temperature but there is a lot of variability.  I'm thinking something from an airplane would be much better.  Each replication is approximately 75 x 120 ft. and contains 8-30 trees.  I believe there are some private consultants who offer fly-over  services using some type of infrared film.  However, I've never been satisfied that they know what they are measuring.  This would be an ideal opportunity for someone working on developing remote sensors to verify their utility with ground based measurements.     7/24/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Dave Goldhamer, Dept. of LAWR, Univ. of CA, Davis, Dave@uckac.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>92-1</STRONG>     If you are interested in  an airborne SAR experiment, contact leon Maldonado at leon@blacks.jpl.nasa.gov for a flight request form. 7/25/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 90:<STRONG>      At Canada Centre for Remote Sensing we have developed and tested a geometric  correction model to geocode SIR-C/X-SAR images with DEM.  The model also allow us to integrate images acquired in different imaging configuration.  The model  takes into account the parameters of the sensor, of the space shuttle and of the  earth. We want to write a user friendly interface to extract the ancillary data  (_ldr_ceos_ascii) and process them accordingly to the physical parameters of the  geometric coorection model.  The parameters that are essential for the model are the ephemeris data which are given in the "GREENWICH TRUE OF DATA" reference coordinate system.  What is this coordinate system?  What are the X,Y,Z axis  related to this system? Where is the origin? Moreover, research group that are interested in the model should fell free  to contact us...   7/19/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Yves Crevier / Thierry Toutin, Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, crevier@ccrs.nrcan.gc.ca</ADDRESS><P><EM>No responses have been submitted.</EM><HR><H1>Submit a Response</H1><FORM METHOD="post" ACTION="/cgi-bin/bb-SubmitResponse.pl/90"><P> Enter your response in this box:<BR><EM>(This text box does not autoscroll.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 89:<STRONG>      I thought one of the things radar measured was distance, why then the need for IFSARE? If one knows the x,y,z of a transmitter, why  can't elevations be determined from that? 7/19/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>kapolka@erim.org</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>89-1</STRONG>     It is true that radar measures distance, and in SAR, we know the line of site distance to every point from the radar (accuracy depends on the bandwidth).  But, remember that with a side looking radar, the line of site distance to a target is due to both the horizontal distance to a target and to the topography.  A mountain may appear closer horizontally because it is higher and therefore closer to the radar.  With interferometric SAR, we can separate these two effects. 7/20/95<ADDRESS>Bruce Chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>89-2</STRONG>     The range, R, is just one coordinate in a polar coordinate system. Imaging radar, with its side-looking geometry, can also separate objects in the azimuth dimension, which is another polar coordinate. But, normally  it is impossible to separate two objects at the same range and azimuth but different elevation angles. Thus we can only measure two polar coordinates well, which means we cannot convert back to x,y,z properly. Radar interferometry allows  us to measure elevation angles which solves the problem. 8/ 9/95<ADDRESS>tony freeman, jpl</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 78:<STRONG>      Hallo there, two questions if I may, I don't know if this is the right place to put them in: 1. What's the status of NASA's IN-STEP programme, especially the  topic of inflattable radar antenna's? 2. As you might know, a spaceborne P-band SAR does not exist at the moment. Is there an interest or support in a P-band SAR system (spaceborne)? In the Netherlands there is a great interest especially for forest monitoring. Please send me some of your suggestions/comments. 6/16/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Wim Looyen, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR, looyen@nlr.nl</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>78-1</STRONG>     Upon request of Tom Pringle I herewith respond to my own question with some elaborations on the use of P-band SAR for forest monitoring.  Preliminary results of current on-going research indicate the usefulness of P- band SAR data for forestry applications. These results have been obtained with airborne P-band SAR data from JPL's AIRSAR system.  P-band seems to be most suitable for species and tree age discrimination. The backscatter in P-band appears to be related to the amunt of branch biomass. P- band data are highly correlated to forest structure parameters, especially in P- band HH the trunk-ground scatter mechanism contributes to the backscatter.P- band data seems to be correlated to bole volume. Differences in soil moisture conditions can be shown in P-band data. P-band data seesm to be correlated with biomass, and as such a good indicator for selective logging. 6/18/95<ADDRESS>Wim Looyen, National Aerospace Laboratory, looyen@nlr.nl</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>78-2</STRONG>     Some years ago, we made a proposal for a P-band (about 70 cm wavelength) radar to be attached to the Space Station. That one was rejected. It's still of great interest, but, at least at JPL, there are no plans for another proposal. In addition to the applications you mention, the increased penetration would be of great interest to geologists and archaeologists studying the sand-covered Sahara. As you infer, a large antenna would be necessary to provide decent resolution at P-band. In the interests of smaller and lighter spacecraft, we have been looking at inflatable antennas, especially the kind that become rigid after inflation, so you don't have to worry about leaks. Finally, a side note of interest: our studies have usually assumed the use of circular polarization as the Earth's ionosphere has a strong effect on the polarization of radar at P-band frequencies.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 76:<STRONG>      The May 30, 1995 issue of Eos (Transactions of AGU) has a lead article on the TOPSAT mission.  Where is there additional information about this mission, on the Web?  How does the  funding look for it? Has it entered Phase C/D? What launch vehicle is expected to be used? Thanks. 6/ 9/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Harold Geller, CIESIN, hgeller@ciesin.org</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>76-1</STRONG>     Thanks for your interest in TOPSAT; unfortunately, there is no additional information on the web for this potential mission. The Radar Home Page is probably the best place to look for updates, though. TOPSAT is currently a "pre-project", meaning that significant studies have been done on its feasibility, performance, etc., but no committment has been made to actually fly it. As you know, budgets are extremely tight, so it is difficult to start a new project without a lot of support. There is also another option that has recently been put forward: a third flight of SRL, modified for interferometry (see way back to question 34). This could provide digital topographic data almost as good as TOPSAT, though missing areas poleward of the shuttle's orbit (about 50-55 deg latitude). The launch vehicle for TOPSAT is currently planned to be a Delta (both satellites would fit on one launch vehicle).  6/12/95<ADDRESS>Tom Farr, JPL, tom.farr@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>76-2</STRONG>     You may want to take a look at the report to the National Research Council on <a href="http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/nrc/">"Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar : Current Status and Future Directions".</a>  This report describes ideas for future missions.  6/12/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 74:<STRONG>      Dear colleaques, I would be very oblieged to anyone who could send me information about the possibility of detecting "LEAKS IN BURIED WATER PIPELINES" by using RADAR images. 6/ 2/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Dr. Nickolaos Soulakellis, Dept. of HUMAN GEOGRAPHY, Univ. of the AEGEAN, LESBOS, GREECE, nsoul@geo.aegean.gr</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>74-1</STRONG>     Let's assume the water is not puddling at the surface and that the pipeline is not buried to deep.  I think you would be better off in late spring or summer with color infrared, especially in drier regions.like Greece.  The water leak, even if it never quite reached the surface, would manifest itself as bright pink spot late in the growing season.   Vegetation like tamarisk can probe to 20 meters depth.   Since you know where the pipeline is buried, anomalies along it would be the leaks.  L-band radar might work in sandy situations.  Multi-band radar might also work along the same lines as the color infra-red in detecting secondary vegetation anomalies.     tom @ <a href ="http://gladstone.uoregon.edu:80/~ecqsp/index.html">emerald </a> 6/ 5/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>74-2</STRONG>     i think you want GPR (ground penetrating radar) NOT SAR (synthetic aperture radar). GPR is used frequently in site investigations of buried pipelines  3/15/96<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 73:<STRONG>      Does anyone know if there are current studies using SIR-C to to delineate soils/identify soil types? If so where can I  obtain information? 6/ 1/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Rodney L. Young, L.S.U. -Graduate Student-Agronomy, ryoung@tiger.lsu.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>73-1</STRONG>     <P> I am very interested in this as well.  In many US counties the Soil Conservation has already published soil polygons over b/w orthophotos. The soil data is ground-truthed to some extent but the polygons were drawn for the most part over the photos.  An error of 15-20% by area  [due to unmappable inclusions] was considered acceptable. Often someone has digitized these as well.  Thus there are ample"training" regions for teaching radar to recognize soil types.  <P>  However, in my opinion, automated radar soil classification won't correlate very well with SCS polygons.  This is because soil taxonomy doesn't define categories or distinctions that are necessarily consistent physically.  I question whether if you walked into an SCS office with a 6' core with what probability it would be correctly identified as to polygon type.<P>  Now radar should be able to do something on soils and at far better resolution.  And robably something more real than SCS soil types.  But radar polygons will probably have to be field-interpreted from scratch.   tom @ <a href = "http://gladstone.uoregon.edu:80/~ecqsp/index.html">emerald</a> 6/ 5/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 70:<STRONG>      For those of you with netscape1.1, how many of you like or dislike the green background color? I kind of like it myself, because I think it makes the home page stand out, and , if I made ALL the pages with this  background color, you would instantly know that you were at the imaging radar home page, and not somewhere else, like the EROS data center, or the JPL PIO site, etc.  But, I have been getting some mixed notices.  What do you all think??? should I change the color?  get rid of backgrounds all together?  keep it? 5/19/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>70-1</STRONG>     The concept is a good one -- to provide a consistent 'signature'.  I would prefer a <blink>more subdued</blink> colors, also for your red, black, and yellow pages.    Note Netscape users can override your choice using Options> Preferences..> Fonts& Colors > Colors.  If users have set their monitors to 24 bit, the green can come over as an unattractive dark gray. <P> Why not use a more tasteful and visually interesting fabric or texture supplied free by Netscape Comm. Corp., supplemented by a subdued JPL watermark on each page, the way <a href ="http://dutlru8.lr.tudelft.nl/indian/mss_010.html">Delft </a>does?  Finally, are you aware that green and all its variants are copyrighted by Emerald Imagery for exclusive use? tom @ <a href ="http://gladstone.uoregon.edu:80/~susannah/">emerald</a> 5/22/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>70-2</STRONG>     I, too, agree that the green is a little bright. The Coast Guard does a nice watermark, too: http://www.webcom.com/~d13www/welcome.html.  6/ 1/95<ADDRESS>Tom Farr, JPL</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>70-3</STRONG>     test 6/ 2/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>70-4</STRONG>     I would like some soothing background music too, like the jazz they play through RealAudio freeware at <a href ="http://gladstone.uoregon.edu:80/~ecqsp/index.html">Emerald Consulting</a>'s new site.  You can continue to surf, or even quit Netscape, without disrupting the music stream or slowing down that much.   Anon. 6/ 5/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>70-5</STRONG>     New embossed 'JPL' background is classy.  It would look good on all the pages.  tom @ emerald 6/11/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>70-6</STRONG>     As the above message indicates, I have changed the background to an embossed JPL logo.  I hope everyone likes it - I would like to see more identity to the imaging radar program, not just jpl, and maybe change text color so that text doesn't get confused by the background. 6/13/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>70-7</STRONG>     ok, I'm happy now with the jpl radar background 6/13/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 67:<STRONG>      A while back, you gave us the ftp site for TOPSAR digital elevation data.  The files there were excellent, but represented only a few of the TOPSAR lines.  I guess what I am trying to say is, where can I find the TOPSAR file "2 Jun 92    Cascade Head 132-1    45-03.0 N    123-57.5 W    132" ?<P>tom @ emerald 5/ 9/95</STRONG><ADDRESS></ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>67-1</STRONG>     Only some of the data that have been collected have been processed. As for the data that have been processed, we do hope to post many of them, but we would like these examples to be of the best quality, which requires some post-processing. I hope to have a number of new scenes processed and posted in a few months. Sorry for the delay. For scenes that have not been processed, we may want to consider a different procedure. The data were originally acquired and processed for NASA-funded investigators. If the investigator never requested a particular scene from a flight line, then it was never processed. It may be possible to process some scenes for other requestors. I'll check into our Outreach program, to see if that might be an avenue to satisfy outside requests for processing.  5/ 9/95<ADDRESS>Tom Farr, JPL, tom.farr@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>67-2</STRONG>     Thank you, Tom, for a very encouraging response.  I am going to try to make a case for processing this particular piece of TOPSAR data: <P>Cascade Head is a  coastal headland in Oregon, comprising part of the World Biosphere Reserve program.  It is owned on the south by the Nature Conservancy.  The conservation issues are a federally threatened fritillary [which feeds exclusively on a violet growing only under certain soil depth and moisture conditions], a rare endemic plant [the Cascade Head silene], and an endangered grassland community type menaced by succession. There is a need to know slope-acres of habitat accurately, as opposed to sea level projected-acres.<P> The northern half is remnant old-growth Sitka spruce forest, managed by the US Forest Service largely as a Research Natural Area and marine mammal sanctuary.  There has not been funds to do more than an initial establishment report.  GIS work has been held back by lack of a good digital elevation model of the rugged and slippery terrain. <P>The adjacent Salmon River estuary has been the focus of a major salt marsh restoration project to benefit fall chinook salmon.  Here subtle elevation differences are crucial in the berm-breaching endeavor, to determine the extent of tidal influences on the future plant community. <P>Radar imaging could offer some unique benefits to the managment of all three areas because heavy coastal fog and clouds prevents dependable aerial photo imaging.  The acreage is too small for useful Landsat or Spot pixels. <p>As an experiment, Emerald Imagery has volunteered to construct and initially maintain a multi-agency Web GIS page for this site, serving up custom maps in response to project-specific GIS queries.   [This is essentially a micro-version of <a href = "http://www-nais.ccm.emr.ca/">Canada's National Atlas</a>.]  This approach is needed because it is not cost-effective to train or equip remote field staffs in high-end techno-rubble.  Hopefully, the three agencies will also cooperate more effectively, using the Web page as the common repository for submitted mapping data.  <P> I can't promise any short-term glory in this for JPL/NASA but I can say it is darned good project for potentially displaying the capabilities offered by the radar imaging program.  tom @ emerald    email: tingalsb@oregon.uoregon.edu 5/10/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>67-3</STRONG>     I see now where I should have directed my project plug directly to the <a href =" /outreach/info.html"> outreach channel </a> JPL has kindly provided.  They are in need of a slick Web form page to make requests easier.  There are a couple of sites I need too, including the Gila River/ Black Canyon riparian areas [beaver in the past???] in notorious Catron County, New Mexico [unsafe to visit except by remote sensing!] and the Soda Mt. Wilderness proposal, a pain as far as USGS maps are concerned because it straddles the Oregon/California border.  I suppose when each mission has a clickable map of coverage showing processed and unprocessed data it would make the process easier on the outreach program.  tom @ emerald 5/12/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 66:<STRONG>      <P>The information newly provided in <a href ="/proc/proc2.23.95.html"> Standard Data Products - Processed List </a> is most welcome.  However, I am not nuts about it being sorted by data take.  I would have preferred a sort by country, state, and site.  When I uploaded the download into MS Word as formatted text, to my horror, I found that the list was only partially tab-delimited, that is, I could not drop it into a database or spreadsheet without some serious correction tedium. <P>Is it not possible to have the original table sortable by clicking on the column header, using cgi to drive a freeware list sorter?    <P>tom@emerald 5/ 8/95</STRONG><ADDRESS></ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>66-1</STRONG>     I put the document on-line, even though I do want to make a searchable sort of this information.  I just have not had time to do this, but I wanted to get SOMETHING on-line. <br> One problem with your suggestions is that the datatake name or even the scene does not always indicate the country,or state.  Also, this list has to be updated frequently, so I am want to make it easily modified. 5/ 8/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>66-2</STRONG>     I see now that  HTML <blink>tables </blink>download as tab-delimited text.  These aren't too bad too update: just update the single integer for the number of rows.   Filemaker Pro 3.0 will come with TCP/IP Internet support [MacWeek 05.08.95, page 66].  Note that Eudora, that e-mail freeware, is sorting its tables of senders, dates, subjects and recipients.    Isn't the source code available?   tom @ emerald 5/11/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>66-3</STRONG>     The word on the Web is to forget Filemaker Pro and use <a href ="http://www.everyware.com/default.html"> Butler/Link Web software</a> as it is much faster and simpler to set up.  There is a free demo package but it looks like it will cost $249 to get the SQL server part for real.  Tom @ Emerald 5/20/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 64:<STRONG>      I am trying to get information on Sea Surface Temps (SST).  I am not sure what  sats pick up this information, but I saw this area as a place to begin asking  questions.  There are places where SST charts are available, but the GIFs that exist are of too large an area.  Is there a place to get the latest SST charts for smaller areas?  Is there a place to get the data and/or a program that will convert that data into a nice color image?  Any help is greatly appreciated. 5/ 3/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Chris Malinowski, Curious onlooker, chris.malinowski@ssa.gov</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>64-1</STRONG>     The only site about SST I know of is the <a href="http://sst-www.jpl.nasa.gov">avhrr pathfinder </a> home page.  They can probably tell you what is available. 5/ 4/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>64-2</STRONG>     Bruce, Thanks for your response.  It appears that the pathfinder data is old.  The data/charts I am seeking would need to be current.  The Rosenstial School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/home.html) offers current charts, but  they cover to much area (such as the entire US east coast).  What I am looking for is charts or data/program where I can put in lat/long and get the SST charts for something like a 70mile radius from that point. 5/ 4/95<ADDRESS>Chris Malinowski, Curious onlooker, chris.malinowski@ssa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>64-3</STRONG>     Eventually, they will catch up to the present, but currently they are only up to 1991. I don't know of any other location to get this information.  sorry. 5/ 4/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>64-4</STRONG>     I came across by accident this totally cool map server that provides <a href ="http://dutlru8.lr.tudelft.nl/ceo/pim.html"> mean sea elevation </a> in client selected map projection,  geoid, gravity anomalies, and contours or shading.  This isn't quite what you asked for, which was sea surfaces temperatures, but it does have a maritime flavor and is a nice example of how your data should be supplied.  tom @ emerald 5/16/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 62:<STRONG>      I am interested in applying radar image processing algorithms to side-scan sonar images of the seabed.  In particular, I would like to machine classify different bottom types. Being a geologist with zero programming skills, is there anyone out  there who has some ideas on this matter? I have a feeling that  fractal techniques to quantify texture is the way to go.  My intention would be to use a neural net classifierr to segment imagery based on fractal signatures.  This would require training the classifier  with example "spectra". I am involved in marine diamond exploration off the west coast of southern  Africa.  We use a heap of side-scan sonar imagery to map spotential diamond trap sites.  Manual  interpretation is rather tedious, hence this enquiry.  4/25/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Andrew Terhorst, Managing member, TerraMare Remote-Sensing, remsense@iafrica.com</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>62-1</STRONG>     Dear Andrew. I work at the Defense Research Agency in England, we are expert in the automatic classification and segmentation textures. Our work concentrates on radar imagery but the algorithms would also be well suited to sonar, which I have had some experience of. I would advise against both fractals and neural networks certainly in the initial stages of the work. Predominantly the best discriminants for textures are relatively simple statistics of the "noise field", neural networks are a 'black box' and the effort involved in getting an optimal solution is normally far less through more mundane techniques given that one has some handle on the processes involved in image formation. You seem to have set yourself an enormous task and one that involves a one-man repetition of work that has occupied large teams here and else where for many years. Have you considered paying somebody else to write a good package for you? 5/ 2/95<ADDRESS>Mark Williams, DRA- Malvern, MLWILLIAMS%TAZ.dnet@hermes.dra.hmg.gb</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 61:<STRONG>      SIR-C employed a data reduction scheme called Block Adaptive Quantization which  reduced the data volume from 8 bits/sample to 4 bits/sample. I am interested in finding out more about the scheme and any studies that may have been done regarding the impact of the data compression on applications such as SAR  interferometry. Can anybody point me in the right direction? 4/21/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Ian McLeod, UBC, ianmc@ee.ubc.ca</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>61-1</STRONG>     In 1990, we conducted a study of the impact of BFPQ on the raw data and on the  image data.  Sorry to say but we did not publish the results anywhere. Basically, the study showed that the signal-to-distortion ratio for single-look pixel is around 11 dB .  The phase distortion study concentrated on four-look pixels and the phase error resulting from BFPQ had a standard deviation of the  order of 3 degrees with a zero mean.  Interferometry uses the single look pixel phase   and this problem was not addressed.  Our experience with with interferometry  and SIR-C data suggests that BFPQ data can be used succesfully to generate interferograms.  Nevertheless, a more formal study of the impact of the BFPQ quantization on single look image data would be welcome.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 59:<STRONG>      We are interested in speckle filtering techniques applied to radar images. For evaluation of these procedures our student project needs some unfiltered (raw) images. Does anybody have an idea how we can get this type of data ?  4/18/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Tamas Doka, dtamas@cc.matav.hu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>59-1</STRONG>     Interesting project -- let us know more about radar-specific angles of speckle filtering.  Note that the filter source codes in Question 50, Response 2 are speckle filters, but not adapted in any way to JPL Stokes matrices.<P> You may wish to consider Question 24, Responses 2 and 3.  These propose  corrections to raw radar data that possibly should be applied before despeckling.  JPL has not yet mustered a response to these suggestions so their merits are unknown.<P> tom / Emerald Imagery:  tingalsb@oregon.uoregon.edu  4/19/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>59-2</STRONG>     The images you want are called Single Look Complex (SLC) Images. They are usually available from the same places as the filtered (multi-looked) images.  Personally I use ERS-1 data. To order ERS-1 data contact:  Radarsat International ERS Order Desk 3851 Shell Road Richmond, B.C.

<STRONG>59-3</STRONG>     Ian, what software are you recommending for analyzing Single Look Complex data from ERS-1?  What are the advantages of ERS-1 data?  I am not going to order data over the telephone -- does this place [Radarsat International ERS Order Desk] in B.C. not have a home page?  I see where there is a home page <a href = "http://services.esrin.esa.it/specers2.htm"> for ERS-2 </a>..... tom @ emerald  email: tingalsb@oregon.uoregon.edu (tom pringle) 4/24/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<STRONG>59-5</STRONG>     What type of filter are you testing?   We have tested an adaptive filter (FGAMMA filter, Lopes et al. 1993) on SIR-C SLC data of an gricultural area.  The filter did a wonderful job. It preserved the edges, strong scatterers, and linear features. We are interested to test the performance of other adaptive filter - if  somebody have suggestion... 4/26/95<ADDRESS>Yves Crevier, Canada Centre for Remote sensing, crevier@ccrs.emr.ca</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>59-6</STRONG>     I am just browsing past - but cannot resist the temptation to make a plug. Why don't you process your own data from e.g. ERS-1 raw data on Exabyte?  We market a comprehensive space based SAR processing package, at very reasonable licensing rates, running on Sun and Silicon Graphics platforms - does a great job for strip mode interferograms; precision calibration; precison focusing; georereferencing etc. I have forgotten my email  address, but fax/phone me for further details if you are interested.  Incidentally, the best (i mean stunning) speckle reduction algorithm that I have seen used some form of simulated annealing technique. 4/26/95<ADDRESS>Andy Smith, Phoenix Systems UK tel/fax (181)-549-8878, Forgotten it!</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 58:<STRONG>      We have set up a <a href="/contest/contest.html">contest to make the most interesting image from SIR-C data!</a> If you have any comments or suggestions about it, I hope you will pass them along as responses to this question! 4/17/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Bruce Chapman, JPL, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>58-1</STRONG>     The images chosen for the contest bears an uncanny resemblance to the confluence of the east and west branches of the Susquehannah River at Sunbury, Pa.  The contest speaks of Sudbury, Pa which seems to be a vaporville, cartographically speaking.  I think the first person to point this ou should get a JPL pencil as a prize.<P>tom@emerald 4/19/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>58-2</STRONG>     I would like to know the dates on which the variour radar images for the contest were taken (e.g., spring or fall),  the slant angle for each channel, and also a list of processing steps taken to get everything registered, resized, and byte-imaged.  For example, if some channels have experienced interpolation, was this done with bicubic?  Might it be possible to add an eighth 'image' of more primary unedited data?<P>tom @ emerald 4/19/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>58-3</STRONG>     Ahhh, I spelled it wrong, I apologize! I will also add more information as you suggest.  4/21/95<ADDRESS>Bruce Chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>58-4</STRONG>     Do contest rules allow submissions in the form of Web html pages?  Because explanatory notes on methodology are required, this might be a good way to integrate text and image(s).  The one meg size limit could still be enforced.<P> tom @ emerald<P> 4/22/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>58-5</STRONG>     I stumbled two other Sunbury, Pa files on your server that didn't make it into the contest or the radar home page, namely <a href ="http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov:80/contest/">PennContest_Ctot and LTot, </A>evidently total backscatter intensity from the C and L bands.  Did you derive Cvv  from Chh, Chv, and Ctot for purposes of the seven channels of the contest? <P>tom @ emerald<P> 4/22/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>58-6</STRONG>     Now I see that Ctot and Ltot are displaced to the north from the other images and do not afford the same coverage.  They do have some value in understanding the geological context, though. 4/22/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>58-7</STRONG>     The contest have evolved slightly since conception.  Originally, the seven gifs available did not include the vv channel, but instead had the total power.  Since the total power is just a function of the other channels, however, I decided to change the channels available to hh, hv, and vv.  They were of a slightly different area.  I also did not have the  raw files available, and I was concerned that the pixel spacing was not exactly 50 meters. <p> In fact, the images of Sunbury are a subset of a much larger, higher resolution image.  However, in the interest of keeping the files small, we averaged the images by a factor of 4, and we took just a subset of the image. <p> I think it is a great Idea to make an html page that  describes the image that you create.  If anyone wants to make a clickable image map, I will do what I have to do on my end to make it work... 4/24/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>58-8</STRONG>     I hadn't though of a clickable map -- great idea and most appropriate.  I think this is preferable to degrading the image with overlain text and boundaries -- now the viewers can click over to something they want to see interpreted more cleanly.  Suppose we get the clickable map going on our our drive -- will it be portable?<P> It would be cool to see the wider area, higher resolution file, say  an RGB as Ctot, Ltot, X.  This would provide contestants with more context as well as ability to test their interpretations.  It's tough now with less than two pixels per acre.  I agree with the need to keep files small with seven channels.  My usual mode of operation is to track what I am doing on small files in Daystar's Photomatic scripting addition to Photoshop, then run it overnight, mistakes and all, on the higher resolution files.  So that could be another contest variant: best Photomatic script.  It would make for a better final educational display.<P>  Also, I am a little concerned over just a cubic spline conversion of slant range to ground range.  It seems to me that this does not take into account ground topography.  A terrain model could be constructed from a DEM for the particular perspective that the radar saw and the ground pixels adjusted according to their relative aspect.  Has JPL considered this?

<STRONG>58-10</STRONG>     Just curious, after spending all weekend playing with this, why Sunbury PA?  5/22/95<ADDRESS>Mark Lucas, Harris Corporation, mlucas@alcatraz.ess.harris.com</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>58-11</STRONG>     We chose Sunbury PA, for a couple of reasons, none of them very significant.    It is an interesting area geologically, but it also has forests and urban areas. It is in a relatively well populated area, so that potentially some people that live nearby could add their impressions.  or, people could drive by some day just to see what it looks like. The data had just been processed, and was conveniently available.  Tony Freeman was the keynote speaker last week at a GIS conference in PA, and he showed this image.  That is about it.  5/23/95<ADDRESS>Bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 55:<STRONG>      Does anyone know if the color fringes in the Kilauea Interferometry image #2 [P-44758 Oct 12, 1994] represent a known vertical and/or horizontal displacement ?  If so, how much approximate maximum shows in the concentric center, first red fringe, first blue/green, next yellow/red, etc.  Is this data verified by GPS or ground survey or both ?  If these things are known it would greatly  add to a volcanic expansion Lab exercise I am designing for my Earth Science students. P.S. To be able to do geoscience with such current data is an exciting opportunity for students !! 3/30/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>William Seebeck , Chantilly HS 4201 Stringfellow RD. Chantilly VA 22021, or POB 163, Lincoln VA 22078</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>55-1</STRONG>     The image you refer to, P-44758, is a detail of the interferogram derived from 2 passes of X-SAR data (April and October, 1994).  The fringe patterns that you see have three likely sources: 1) Topography 2) Small-scale (cm) changes in the position of surface features along the radar line of sight in the six-month interval (i.e. the deformation you asked about) and 3) Differential rotations of the phase of the radar echoes in the two data sets due to differences in atmospheric water vapor abundance along the radar signals' path.  To isolate effect number 2 from the others, one must first remove the topographic effect using a DEM (not trivial, but not too dificult, either), and second, gain an understanding of effect number 3 (very difficult). The atmospheric effect was not recognized originally on the analogous SIR-C "displacement" map (P-44753), but detailed comparisons with GPS data show that this can be a real problem.  Bottom line is, the fringes in the X-SAR image are not merely a simple function of surface displacements, and should not be interpreted as such.  4/ 3/95<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Experiment Scientist, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

Our radar is 94GHz (sees through fog/rain/smoke) and has a 25cm down-range resolution. The cross range resolution is between 1.4m and 4m at 800m range. The data is digitised to 8-bits and yes we fly our own helicopter over what we fancy. Yhis uses most of our buget and the cost per mile is frightening, so I'm not at liberty to hand out free data (sorry). We have automatically registered these images against cartographic maps and x-band SAR. To do the same against infra red images would be harder because of the lack of range information but it is possible. I know people who automatically register infrared images taken at both shallow and steep depression angles, against cart maps. 3/30/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>mark williams, dra uk, MLWILLIAMS%TAZ.dnet@hermes.dra.hmg.gb</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>54-1</STRONG>     Tom's email is tingalsb@oregon.uoregon.edu and his home page is at <a href ="http://gladstone.uoregon.edu:80/~susannah/"> Emerald Imagery<a/> 4/19/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 52:<STRONG>      I work with imaging radar. A forward looking airborn radar scans the ground from +/- 30 degrees at a shallow depression angle. The data is gathered at about 800m. A radar image is made, combining the  information from many sweeps. High down-range resolution plus the use of doppler beam sharpening techniques allow the formation of good quality x-band images. We then aim to automatically register these against cartographic maps and also identify interesting features. Is anybody interested in this sort of work? 3/29/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Mark Williams, DRA - Uk, mlwilliams@taz.dra.hmg.gb</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>52-1</STRONG>     Yes, indeed.  Are you doing custom fly-overs and for what price per mile of swath?  Is the data's dynamic range 8-bit?  What's your ground resolution at 800 meter height?  I would find it more useful to  have the radar image registered with a color infra-red photo, even if it's older, than a cartographic map, if I can't have both.  Why x-band and are you limited to this?   Post some sample radar imagery for us -- forget email, where is your home page anyway?    tom@tingalsb.oregon.urogen.edu 3/29/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 44:<STRONG>      I'm looking for high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) generated from interferometric synthetic apeture radar (IF SAR) data.  Does anyone one know the availability of such data? 3/ 7/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>K. O'Rourke, Pacific Sierra Research Corp, kevin@mgate.psrv.com</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>44-1</STRONG>     i'd like these too!  In the interim, what might we expect from these if they were all done, in terms of ground resolution (=file size) and current coverage? 3/ 9/95<ADDRESS>tom@emerald</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>44-2</STRONG>     I have put a couple of data sets from our airborne TOPSAR instrument online. This is a 2-antenna system that produces 10 m or 20 m pixels with about 1 m height error. In addition, a C-band VV polarization image is produced and the new processor also outputs an incidence angle map and an image representing correlation, related to error. The data come in strips about 15 km wide by a few 10s of km long. Newer data have ascii headers giving all sorts of information about the file. Older data have a terse header file associated with the data files. To get the data, anonymous ftp to fringe.jpl.nasa.gov  and look in the topsar area. I hope to have more data sets and more documentation by this summer.  3/10/95<ADDRESS>Tom Farr, JPL, tom.farr@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>44-3</STRONG>     Thanks, Tom, this worked fine.  I was able to log on easily as described and open both the impressive grayscale Death Valley allulvial fan CVV image (the file called dv_fans164cvv) and the digital elevation model (called dv_fans_164demi2),  on the Mac using Adobe Photoshop, setting raw format at 640 x 2842 pixel width x height for both.   On the DEM, since it is 16 bits per pixel, raw format should be set for two channels, with interleaved checked.  This gives a Photoshop multichannel document, with channel 1 needing a double tweak with 'Levels' and channel 2 having finer detail. 3/15/95<ADDRESS>tom pringle, emerald imagery, tingalsb@oregon.uoregon.edu</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>44-4</STRONG>     The DEM format raises some unfamiliar issues for the folks out there, namely how to display all of it.  The precision of the topographic data necessitated more that the usual 8 bits (0 to 255 after rescaling): 11 bits were needed in the Death Valley scene.  Computer hardware is such that two bytes (16 bits) were needed to contain the 11 bits of data dynamic range (0 to 2048).  JPL, at the anonymous ftp  fringe.jpl.nasa.gov site, essentially put the leading 3 digits in one byte and the trailing 8 digits in the second byte.  This downloads as a Word text document with the two bytes together as one number, but opens in imaging programs as a two separate channels, the leading digits being in channel 1. <P> There is some potential for real confusion here for people used to 24-bit color monitors.  It seems like 24 bits is more than enough to hold 11 bits.  However, that 24 = 3 x 8, and no single 8 is large enough to display 11, i.e., the separate RGB screen phosphors are only set to display 256 levels each. <P> Of course, rounding off to the leading 8 digits and displaying as a grayscale 'byte image' is one possiblility.  This is a waste of good data -- why send the instrumentation up there and not make use of it?  Another option few people will exercise is staring at the array of 640 x 2842 numbers in Word.  For other purposes, such as computing slopes or aspects from the DEM, one could do the calculations on the 11-bit numbers in a spreadsheet, then round off to 8 bits after finishing, obtaining some value in enhanced accuracy from the extra bits. <P> Let's not despair.  Here's a easy way (but not necessarily the ultimate way) to display all 11 bits at once using color to supplement the limitations of 8 bit channels.  Procede as in 44-3.  Then, in the Channels palette, duplicate the trailing bit channel, split, and merge as L.a.b., with leading bits in channel a.  This gives a knock-your-socks-off color image explicitly displaying the full resolution of the data, with color trends indicating the broader contour intervals of the leading bits. <P>I will try to put a small piece of the resulting image into the Lost and Found folder at the ftp site; otherwise, email it to Bruce for inclusion on the home page at his discretion. <P>   tom pringle emerald imagery email:tingalsb@oregon.uoregon.edu 3/15/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>44-5</STRONG>     Another neat way to view the data in color is to place the CVV ground image in L of L.a.b. or B of HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) color modes and the DEM data in the other two channels.  This gives the radar image of the ground over-tinted with colored contour bands.  The fine-structure DEM is very dramatic when viewed in a palette of ten steps of green.  Since the channels are all 640 x 2842, there are no co-registration issues.  To reduce file size for rapid color experimentation, co-crop the full 3-channel image and split the channels. <P> Of course, what Tom Farr really wants us to do with these files is use the digital elevation map to draw a 2-D surface in perspective, then drape the CVV radar image over it.  If the DEM has delicately colored contour bands (so as not interfere with the image),  an overall 'airplane window' effect is achieved, with a subtle guide to actual elevation to facilitate interpretation of the alluvial fans.  Photoshop and the like can only prep the DEM as a DXF file for export to  high-end programs such as Strata 3-D.   A more affordable solution that has many other imaging uses is macGIS ($30 in the educational version).  I am not aware of any freeware up to the task.  Again, I'm willing to donate the final file but there is no way to post it to the TOPSAR folder at this time. <P> tom @ emerald imagery 3/15/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>44-6</STRONG>     I'm impressed with what Tom Pringle has accomplished with Photoshop and the DEMs! I was never able to get Photoshop to ingest the 16-bit topo data, but with his hints, I'll try again. A program I've used on the Mac that accepts 16-bit data is the free program NIH Image. It of course scales the image to 8 bits for display, but retains the transformation, so you can find out what the height of that mountain, etc., is. It allows color tables to be manipulated, etc., but is far less powerful than Photoshop in terms of overlays and color images. I indeed like to overlay images onto topography for perspective views, but there are many other ways to use the DEMs for earth science applications. One that I'm involved in now is the fitting of 3-dimensional equations to landforms, such as alluvial fans (the shallow cones of gravel coming off the mountains in the death valley image). See the Transactions of the Amer. Geophys. Union (Eos), v. 73, p. 553-558 for some details. Other applications are mentioned in an article on TOPSAT (a spaceborne interferometer on the drawing boards) that should be coming out soon in the same newsletter.  3/20/95<ADDRESS>Tom Farr, JPL, tom.farr@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>44-7</STRONG>     <P>Tom, that's a new one to me, about <a href = "ftp://zippy.nimh.nih.gov/pub/nih-image/">NIH Image</A> importing and <strong>retaining </strong>the scaling transformation in going from 16 bits to 8.  I'd seen the dialogue box but thought they just meant two 8-bit channels -- have to take another look.  Thanks! <P> What year is your TAGU (Eos) article and did you mean by <i>newletter</i>   that it is an electronic journal or list server?  Your point is a valid one: for accurate equation-fitting of alluvial fans (and other landforms), the data need not be visualized, so 16 bit data is no problem.  However, my first impulse would be just display the hypsometric layered tint (24 = 8 x 3) and stop with that because the ground scale of the data pixels falls short of topographic variation significant to  physical processes, at least in the case of the Death Valley alluvial fans.   I'm not sure I understand the advantage of analytic equations: the data is rasterized from day one, so why not just calculate from it directly as a GIS layer?   OK, Ok, I'll look at the paper....tom @ emerald 3/26/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<BR><STRONG>425-1</STRONG>     Well, it is going to be tough, as we did not image the whole route with SIR-C, so we might not have data for your site.  Also, the only software that we have that works on a Mac is Macsigma0, but that software only supports AIRSAR radar data format, so you would first have to convert the data from SIR-C data format to AIRSAR data format, but that software only runs on unix platforms.<p> so, in order to make this a manageable task, your data should already have been converted to AIRSAR format - this reduces your available data set to that which is on the education  cd-rom ( can be obtained from <a href="http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/education/cdrom/OrderCD.html">the EDC</a>) - which is pretty limited.  It is also possible that a publically released image might cover your site, which does not require special software to view.

<BR><STRONG>401-1</STRONG>     Atlantis Scientific in Ottawa Canada sells a product called EarthView InSAR.  It is is used to process single look complex (SLC) interferometric pairs to produce DEMs, height change maps, coherence maps, etc..  The software has a Motif-based GUI, many tools, and support documentation.  The software is available for Sun Solaris and SGI IRIX (Release Dec 1996).  Processing of SLC imagery to make interferograms is automatic.  Phase unwrapping is automated as much as possible.  There is optional manual phase unwrapping to correct any remaining phase unwrapping errors.  JERS-1, ERS1/2, RADARSAT sensors are all supported.  Exciting applications of this software include change detection and land deformation measurement. We have achieved some impressive results studying earthquake deformation and land subsidence.  Atlantis also sells a SAR processor which is recommended for producing precision SAR imagery, but is not essential for using the EarthView InSAR software.    For  more information visit http://www.atlsci.com or email blynch@atlsci.com. 11/15/96<ADDRESS>Bernie Armour, Atlantis Scientific, barmour@atlsci.com</ADDRESS>

We've been thinking about doing that and will get such a list posted sometime this week.  The list will contain the DT number, site name, scene center GMT and scene center latitude and longitude, along with some other information.  This list can be used in conjunction with the posted survey data to get a "preview" of the precision processed scene.

<STRONG>39-2</STRONG>     This is an update to the previous response.  The EROS Data Center is now achiving and distributing the SIR-C precision data as it is processed.  They have posted browse images of the precision data on their web site (see the related links on the internet section on the JPL site for that connection).  We transfer data to EROS on a monthly basis so their database will continue to grow over the next year. 9/11/95<ADDRESS>Ellen O'Leary, JPL, SIR-C Radar Data Center, ellen.oleary@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 35:<STRONG>      I have had a few questions from users wondering how to use the .IMG files from the <a href="http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/sir-c/sir-c.html">EROS data  center</a>.  Has anyone used these files with the <strong>ERDAS imagine </strong> program? 2/16/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>35-1</STRONG>     the .IMG survey image files are just raw byte image files. In this case, the .IMG does not refer to ERDAS' Imagine image format, which also has a .IMG extension. Most any image processing program can read the survey images as raw bytes, using the dimension information associated with the survey product.  2/21/95<ADDRESS>Tom Farr, tom.farr@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>35-2</STRONG>     If you are working with ERDAS-IMAGINE software you can import this king of format in the import-expot option using the "generic bynary data" option. You only need to know the number of lines, samples and header bytes, and  you can know all this information from the header of your images. 3/25/95<ADDRESS>Alvaro Marquez, Complutense University, Madrid, Spain, anguita@eucmvx.sim.ucm.es</ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>352-1</STRONG>     All of the SIR-C data that has been processed to  frame products is available from the EROS data  center.  They have a web site with browse images  and the data can be ordered over the web.  The web  address is:   http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/sir-c/precision I know that there are quite a few products that  would meet your needs, particularly some in the  American west.  7/26/96<ADDRESS>Ellen O'Leary, JPL Radar Program, ellen@kahn.jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>356-1</STRONG>     Here are the approximate values:   Near range incidence angle: 46.9 deg.;  Center incidence angle: 49.5 deg.;  Far range incidence angle: 51.7 deg.  8/ 9/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

I think you can do  the same with a image file listing.  That error message may have more to do with  configuring your browsers helper applications for  the particular file type that you want to view.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 34:<STRONG>      I keep hearing rumors of a third flight for the SIR-C radar.  Rumor has it will fly with an extended arm of some sort that will have a receive only panel array.  Is the third flight on the drawing board or just rumor?  And what is the purpose of the receive only array on the extended arm?  Final question when will the SIR-C images come out on CD-ROM and how can I get one?  Thanks Bruce. 2/16/95</STRONG><ADDRESS></ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>34-1</STRONG>       You might want to look at <a href="http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/bb-MakeResponsePage.pl/qnum=08"> the response to question 8</a>.  There, Diane Evans replies to this question. The SIR-C Survey data is already on CD-ROM, for information, <a href="http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/sir-c/sir-c.html"> click here</a>.  In a few months, we should be distributing the SIR-C post flight education CD-ROM.  This cd-rom will have some images from sirc.  There is currently no plans to distribute other images or data by cd-rom, though some commercial companies have expressed an interest in some.  I will let everyone know here at the imaging radar  home page. 2/16/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>34-2</STRONG>     Since Diane's response, there has been a lot of activity involved in definition of what a third flight of SIR-C/X-SAR could do. One of the options being explored is to add a boom about 30 m long with a C-band and maybe an X-band antenna on it. This would allow single-pass interferometry to be accomplished which could be used to produce a digital topographic map of the entire earth (between 60 deg N and S latitudes) at about 80 m horizontal resolution. As Diane said, decisions will be made in the next month or two whether this will be pursued.  2/17/95<ADDRESS>Tom Farr, JPL, tom.farr@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>34-3</STRONG>     In one month I will publish a CD-ROM called "Earth Exploratorium".  It contains 12000 visual images for SRL-1 and over 40 SIR-C/X-SAR images in a  very unique navigational interface with lots of search capabilities. For more info, send e-mail to rmdp@csn.org. Newt Perdue, Rocky Mountain Digital Peeks 303-258-3779, only $39. 3/27/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>342-1</STRONG>     Your speculation is correct.  Mode 11 provided dual pol data with a very wide swath - up to 80 km in some cases.  Mode 16, although it provides quad pol data, was too small a swath (usually less than 20 km).  Most of the SIR-C science team geologists preferred the wider swath to the quad pol data. 7/ 9/96<ADDRESS>Ellen O'Leary, JPL Radar Data Center, ellen@kahn.jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>342-2</STRONG>     It's been my experience that, for relatively  unvegetated geologic surfaces, a like and a cross  polarization give most of the useful information.  One of the disadvantages, though, is that current  inversion models require quad-pol data.   7/ 9/96<ADDRESS>Tom Farr, JPL, tom.farr@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>344-1</STRONG>     No, you do not need to have access to the internet - netscape 1.0 is even on the disk to read the files locally. 7/19/96<ADDRESS>Bruce Chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>345-1</STRONG>     SIR-C/X-SAR took quite a bit of data of NY and NJ  (but none of PR and the VI, I'm afraid).  Take a  look at <a href = "http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/sir-c/sir-c.html"> SIR-C Images from EROS  Data Center </a> to see what's there.  Try both the  survey and precision product pages.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 32:<STRONG>      Some comments:  1) How about an imaging radar 'who's who' with information on research interests, possibly brief biographical details, and a contact address. This would be a  useful resource for researchers. I mean this to include anybody, and not just limit it to the JPL staff.  2) I would like to see the standard sample datasets available via the WWW route. One of each format, from each sensor would be nice. 'Real' data, rather than pictures, of course. Ditto the standard docs, preferably in postscript format.  3) A list of available JPL radar reports/publications along with ordering info (etc) would be useful. This would stop me having to bug the radar librarians so I guess they'd be happy too. Perhaps a section on radar textbooks would be a useful item too.  4) Finally, congratulations on the BBS and the updated home page!

<STRONG>32-2</STRONG>     Nice job on expanding the SAR reference list -- last time I looked it only had one entry!  I wonder if some of the <blink> key </blink> papers could be put online, or at least the abstracts, or links if the journals are ftp sites -- one hopes that some of the papers are still around, electronically speaking, and wouldn't have to be OCRd in.  I'm at a large research university and frankly, no one has ever heard of some of these journals. 3/19/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>32-3</STRONG>     There is a SIR-C/X-SAR directory with all addresses and e-mails of all scientists.  It should be aviable with JPL. But it is paper, of course.

<BR><STRONG>329-1</STRONG>     There are several useful www locations you can try in order to find if there are radar or optical images of your area of interest.  Look for SIR-C imagery at the <a href="http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landaac/sir-c/sir-c.html> USGS. </a> You might even try the <a href="http://services.esrin.esa.it/"> ESA </a> home page for information about ERS-1 and ERS-2.  You could attempt to work with the <a href="telnet://nasdadir@nsaeoc.eoc.nasda.go.jp"> NASDA </a> site which will give you access to JERS-1 data information.  Finally, you can find a treasure trove of useful images, and a very nice user interface at the <a href="http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/html/home.html"> NASA JSC image collection </a> where you will find mainly optical data.  If all this fails to locate data of your area, you may have to resort to data from other commercial satellites. Get in touch with me and I can give you pointers for that. 6/17/96<ADDRESS>Stephen McNeill, Landcare Research New Zealand, mcneills@landcare.cri.nz</ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 30:<STRONG>      I am doing thesis work comparing shuttle visible imagery with radar data from SIR-C, preferably taken at the same time.  Currently there is no cross  reference option within the JPL Radar page.  Is there one buried somewhere  that I don't know about?  I am specifically looking for coastal scenes. 2/15/95</STRONG><ADDRESS> Drew Hartigan, Naval Postgraduate School, hartigan@physics.nps.navy.mil</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>30-1</STRONG>     check http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/html/earth.htm  for listings of hand-held photography from the second flight, by lat, lon, or frame number. Unfortunately, they don't list the pix by MET, so it'll be hard to cross-reference to the radar images... 3/23/95<ADDRESS>Tom Farr, JPL, tom.farr@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>301-1</STRONG>     As you may be aware, there was an an experiment on the SIR-C/XSAR mission - take a look at the <a href="http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/imagemaps/html/srl-northsea.html">XSAR image</a>. 5/ 7/96<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>302-1</STRONG>     Who are these people!!? Are they on drugs or just escapees from a mental home? 5/14/96<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>304-1</STRONG>     Try to search "sound imaging" with some search  engine like altavista.digital.com I am interested too, let me know, just in case we  could arrange a teaming on this argument.  Ciao,  Marcello 5/22/96<ADDRESS>Marcello Melis, Space Engineering, Rome, Italy, melis@space.it</ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>305-1</STRONG>     JERS-1 is L-band (23 cm) <p> SIR-C is C-band (5.8cm) and L-band(23cm), XSAR is X-band (3cm) 5/28/96<ADDRESS>Bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>305-2</STRONG>     Longer wavelengths are less sensitive to temporal change than shorter ones.  We produced a differential interferogram over Kobe, Japan where the two SAR images were acquired 1.5 years apart, and still there was good coherence.  This was with JERS-1 (23 cm wavelength). Such results would not be possible with C-band sensors.  However, we  have recently produced an interferogram and DEM using RADARSAT fine beam mode (C-band ~8x8m resolution) over a mostly exposed rock island that had excellent coherence.  Hence there are many areas over which good coherence can still be obtained even with C-band and X-band SARs. 6/ 7/96<ADDRESS>Bernie Armour, Atlantis Scientific Systems Group, Inc., barmour@atlsci.com</ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>303-1</STRONG>     Assuming by 3-D image you mean an image with height information, SAR interferometry will easily produce such results.  If you require ground penetrating radar, then I would think long wavelength sensors and airborne platforms would be best. 6/ 7/96<ADDRESS>Bernie Armour, Atlantis Scientific , barmour@atlsci.com</ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>309-1</STRONG>     Contact Gerry Brown at NASA HQ for possibilities. No guarantee 6/17/96<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>309-2</STRONG>     Try using SLAR in conjunction with the new Indian optical satellite.  The SLAR should be able to  identify differential compaction in the soil.   Geocorrected SLAR resampled with the high res  Indian data should allow you to follow up on the anomalies. 7/ 8/96<ADDRESS>Patrick_Lengyel@plengyel.mb.ca</ADDRESS>

<STRONG>29-2</STRONG>     Now the $64,000 question is how to edit, collate, remove repetitions, and reorganize largish lists of bookmarks.  Netscape 1.1b1, according to MacWeek, has an automatic dead link finder but its location escapes me.  Basically, exported bookmarks need to drop into a flatfile database with sorting of URLs and drag-and-drop re-ordering, then be recoverable as bookmarks in the new arrangement.   I  got this going, more or less, using 'replace' many times in Word and Word tables, via Works, but it is too much of a hack.  Maybe someone has a freeware solution out there.  It would be best if Netscape dealt with it internally. tom@emerald 3/19/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>291-1</STRONG>     My hunch is that this conversion factor (CF) was chosen arbitrarily to be lower than any possible lowest backscatter target. The noise floor for JERS-1 is more likely in the -30 to -40 dB range. The CF is just a minimum backscatter value that corresponds to 0 DN in the image data.  4/18/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>291-2</STRONG>     The CF factor was obtained by looking at the backscatter from corner reflectors, and from distributed rain forest targets.  It is a calibration factor for converting DN values to sigma 0.  The noise floor is closer to -20 dB.<p>Take a look at <a href="http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/users/bc.jers/cal.html"> the paper we wrote on calibration of JERS-1 SAR data</a> 4/22/96<ADDRESS>Bruce Chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>298-1</STRONG>     Nothing special about the SIR-C scale here, but  let me try to explain this, as best I remember:  Decibel (dB) is simply another way to express numbers that commonly span many orders of  magnitude, usually with real values less than 1. The conversion is: 10 * log(base10) of the real number gives you the value in dB. Now, what do  those real numbers represent in radar? They are usually the "normalized radar backscatter cross section" also called "sigma zero". This is the backscatter cross section sigma (in units of  area) per area on the ground.  The backscatter  cross section is the cross sectional area of a  perfectly conducting sphere that would produce  the strength of signal that is observed. So sigma zero has units of area/area (i.e. dimensionless). A sigma zero dB value of 0 means that the  backscatter cross section of the pixel is equal  to the area of the pixel, so sigma/area = 1;  the log of 1 is 0 (times 10 is still zero).  Interestingly, sigma zero is often greater than 0  dB.  This happens on favorably oriented sloping  pixels, where the the radar beam is concentrating  more energy per area than it would on the assumed  flat surface, and the area normalization isn't  enough to make up the difference. Also, various  type of corner reflections can produce sigma zero  values greater than 0 dB.  If "ALL the radar was  backscattered", I think you'd be way over 0 dB,  since a pixel-sized conducting sphere wouldn't  send the energy in the backscatter direction  only.  4/27/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>298-2</STRONG>     In a more practical sense, I thought I would answer with how we determine the sigma0 values : <p> There are some objects that we know theoretically their "radar brightness", i.e. how much radiation will be reflected back to the radar antenna.  For instance, it is well known how "bright" (what we call sigma, as opposed to sigma0) a trihedral corner reflector will look.  So, if we image some corner reflectors (and we don't make any measurement errors), we can determine how bright everything should be in the image.  Then, we normalize these sigma values by the scattering area of each image pixel (usually we assume a smooth surface unless we know the topography). This is then called sigma0, the normalized radar backscatter cross section.  If you take 10log of these values, you get sigma0 in units of db.<p> I like to think of sigma0 as something sort of like the albedo, though this analogy is not completely accurate. 4/29/96<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>299-1</STRONG>     Doubtful. Magnetic anomalies are normally much too small to affect radar backscatter. An aeromagnetic  survey would be much more appropriate. If the  geologic structure of the kimberlite unit was  expressed at the surface, as outcrop, topography  or as a difference in soil and vegetation, then  something might show up on a radar image.  5/ 8/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>299-2</STRONG>     Non-extrusive kimberlites, or partially extrusive kimberlites can have ring-like fracture patterns associated with their emplacement.  Radar  may be the most useful in detectin these subtle features, particularly if there is overburden.  Radar would also be useful in detecting magnetic anomalous features in the tropics because magnetic features are often iron and magnesium rich, or  associated with these lithologies and rocks of  that chemical affinity tend to form erosionally resistant laterite ridges.   7/ 8/96<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 28:<STRONG>      We are interested in looking at the radar images on our Mac, however we seem to be having some problems.  The documentation says we can view images on a Mac with either Photoshop or NIHimage.  Neither of these work on the *.IMG file we have downloaded.  Is there some translation process that we have missed?  And, if so how do we view these images?  And where can we get the appropriate software from? 2/ 9/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Garry Peterson, University of Florida, garry@zoo.ufl.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>28-1</STRONG>     I assume that you have gotten the data from the Eros data center, and have downloaded on of the .IMG image segments.  This file is what photoshop  would call in the "raw" format.  So, open photoshop, pull down the file menu, select "open as", change the file format to "raw", enter the  name of the file.  The next window will ask about the dimensions of the  file : enter the height and width  of the image (this is given at the page that you retrieved the .IMG file.  It will be 2000 in width, as all of the  segments are 2000 in width.)  There is no header in this file.  photoshop should then be able to open the file and display it.  write back if this  does not work... 2/ 9/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>28-2</STRONG>     In Photoshop, after Open, click show all files.  Locate .img file and double click.  There is no need to enter width and height -- Photoshop knows these already.  This is a grayscale so there are no issues with band interleaving. <P> For <a href = "ftp://zippy.nimh.nih.gov/pub/nih-image/"> NIH-Image 1.57  freeware </a>, select Import rather than Open.  Choose Custom and edit to width and height (e.g., 2000 x 1266) and the file will open.   tom@emerald 2/19/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 24:<STRONG>      The novel aspect of the SIR-C  and AIRSAR data sets is the polarization.  If it were just another 3 wavelengths added to IR and visible data layers, we would all know what to do.   My question: is there inter-band statistical correlation of polarization and how do I remove it?  That is, how is principal component analysis done in this context: do I remove inter-band intensity correlation separately or somehow simultaneously with polarization correlation?  Your <A HREF="science/SAR_REFS.html">reference section </A> is under development and still fairly sketchy -- has this been done already? 2/ 5/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Tom Pringle, Emerald Imagery, tingalsb@oregon.uregon.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>24-1</STRONG>     There is often very little correlation between the like-polarized (HH and VV) channels and the cross-polarized (HV or VH) channels in polarimetric radar  measurments. The correlation between HH and VV can be anywhere between 0 and 1 and often carries a great deal of information about the physics of the  scattering which produced the measurements. An additional complication is that the phase difference between HH and VV (whicha re actually complex values)  also carries a lot of information.I can send you some materials on this if you  send me your street address via e-mail.  Tony Freeman, tony.freeman@jpl.nasa.gov 3/16/95<ADDRESS>Tony Freeman, JPL</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>24-2</STRONG>     Thank you, Tony.  I still have a long-winded question for the <blink> technical </blink> bulletin board  about the raw SIR-C data set and its subsequent digestion.  I have been puzzling over questions and responses of #20 and #25, and now #24.   <P>  The radar home page documentation seems to rely on an easy-to-read JPL analysis published in Radio Science, vol. 22, page 529. 1987, to whose notation and diagrams I refer below.   <P> As I understand it, the Shuttle instrument basically collects as primary data the <blink> scattering </blink> matrix parameters, which relate transmitted and received polarization vectors by a 2x2 complex matrix.  This matrix needs to be invertible from considerations of time-reversal invariance of the electromagnetic interaction, so its determinant is not zero.  Sequential scattering is carried by matrix multiplication.  In short, the set of all possible scattering matrices forms the non-compact Lie group Gl(2,C), an 8-dimensional real manifold.    <P> The JPL article states that an overall phase can be neglected, leaving 7 parameters.  This is tantamount to quotienting by the set of all unitary diagonal matrices, a normal subgroup, i.e., GL(2,C)/U(1).  The article goes on to cite a principle of reciprocity developed in an unpublished1965 Dutch doctoral dissertation which sets off-diagonal elements equal, leaving 5 parameters.  Now symmetric complex matrices (cv. self-adjoint) lack group closure: the product of two symmetric matrices is not in general symmetric (because transpose reverses order and multiplication is not commutative).  Yet sequential scattering is a fact of life, so the 1965 proposal may be invalid.  This reciprocity principle is a source of confusion in  # 20 and #25. <P> Removing all scalar matrices from the scattering matrix yields GL(2,C)/GL(1,C) = SL(2,C)/Z(2) = SO(3,1) of dimension 6, or passing to maximal compact simple subgroups, SU(2)/Z(2)=SO(3).  We now see the double cover explains the origin of the double angles in the Poincare sphere representation of the ellipticity diagram used in your polarization signatures.  Many physicists would assume this group from the get-go, invoking general unitarity principles for scattering matrices, the need for the inverse matrix to be the adjoint, conservation of the energy-momentum 4-vector, etc. <P> Now a circularly polarized electromagnetic field carries angular momentum.  Pictorally, the electric field vector rotates about a cylinder whose axis is the direction of translation.  In modern terms, the photon is a massless spin 1 gauge boson transforming under integral representations of the proper Lorentz group SO(3,1).   Plane polararized light is at the other extreme (zero spin), while ellipitcally polarized light is intermediate.  In the Poincare sphere, the angular momentum must in effect be the projection of the elliptical polarization vector on the z axis. Note equatorial polarizations (plane-polarized) have no z-component, as expected. <P> It os instructive to consider orbits of symmetries that conserve angular momentum, namely the subgoup SO(2) = U(1) of the rotation group SO(3).  The action rotates the Poincare sphere on its axis, fixing left and right circular polarizations, taking elliptical polarizations onto their latitude lines, and stabilizing (inter-converting) plane polarizations.  This suggests parameterizing polarization signatures by a longitude. <P> If only magnitude (not sign) is of interest, inversions (reflections that reverse spatial orientation) identify north and south poles, corresponding latitude lines and antipodal equitorial points, reducing the Poincare sphere to RP(2), the real projective plane. Involutions provide a useful eignespace decomposition. The overall symmetry is expanded to the O(2) subgroup of O(3).  More generally, Maxwell's equations are invariant under the full Lorentx group O(3,1)=[Z(2) x Z(2)] x' SO(3,1). <P> So the data seems subject to very substantial symmetry reduction.  Is it not far better for JPL to crunch the data once and for all than to send out  huge unreduced CD-ROMs and explain group theory to a thousand end users?  The polarization signatures (currently imaged as a quasi-Mercator surface or as level curves on the Poincare sphere) positively glow with redundant symmetry.  Where are our friends, the spherical harmonics?  Is there not an even and odd decompostion of isotropy and anisotropy?  Eigenbases of roughness vectors?  Higher order terms that drop?  I guess I am asking for a planned features list of your forthcoming software, macSigma 0. <P>  Notice that both AIRSAR and SIR-C/XSAR provide us initially with undisplayable images, that is, virtual images whose pixels are Stokes matrices.  While I don't have a personal issue with formal manipulations of mulit-dimensional arrays of matrices, image enhancement and scientific interpretation would be greatly facilitated by having monitor-displayable byte images.  The real question is, how many real byte image channels will be needed to display all the information, assuming symmetry effects, under-utilized dynamic range, and intra- and inter- band statistical correlation can be removed?  And how can these channels be chosen so that they retain physical interpretability? <P>  Sorry to be so long-winded! 3/19/95<ADDRESS>Dr.T, Emerald Imagery, tingalsb@OREGON.UOREGON.EDU</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>24-3</STRONG>     In regards to 24-2, the limitation of the classical correlation coefficient is that it only addresses <blink>linear</blink> correlation. In other words, two variables with perfect parabolic correlation could have zero linear correlation.  In the history of statistics, linear correlation was over-emphasized because that was already a handful with adding machines.  [Of course, linear terms arise as the first term in the MacLaurin series expansion of whatever the functional dependence was.]  Today, what with <em>Mathematica </em>  on every desktop, all mannner of complicated relationships are considered in determining the inter-dependence of independence of two variables. <P> To say, for example,  LVV isn't correlated [linearly predictable] from LHH is not to say there isn't some other simple relation between them.  This might be adduced from theoretical grounds or empirically from the scatter diagram.  I must respectfully disagree with decoupling the analysis of phase and amplitude correlations.  [This procedure already wreaks havoc with real variables, where the sign serves as 'phase.'   All the arithmetic operations needed to calculate correlation, such as subtraction, norms, and division, hold for complex numbers.  If we would look in a sufficiently obscure statistics journal, we would find statistics was long ago extended to the case of correlation of complex [or quaternionic, 'phase' a point on 3-sphere] variables.  Correlation is inherently a geometric concept.   <P> I am not sure how much we are going to learn about the physics producing the scattering event.  This is because If the radar pixels are, say,  25 meters square, there are only 9 per acre.  A lot of different things can go on across this ground scale.  Aren't we learning instead about the superpositioning of a large number of possibly unrelated radar reflection events that produced the final composite signal?  I couldn't find  very many images to test on the bulletin board.  However, <A HREF="/jpeg/weddell.jpg">the Weddel Sea</A> used LHV and LHH as R and G.  These images may have gone through many stages of non-linear tweaking.   As posted, the correlation coefficient is indeed low.  The scatter plot shows even better that the case is hopeless. <P> Next, I looked at the <a href="/airsardvimages.html">AIRSAR Death Valley Images</a> for the L, C, and P radar bands.  I did the principal components in Dimple, finding little inter-band linear correlation as these things go:<P>  <center><table border =3 cell spacing = 3cell padding =3 ><tr><td> <table border =6 cell spacing = 8cell padding =8 >         <tr>                 <td colspan=2>L,C,P  Inter-Band Correlation</td>         </tr> <tr>                 <td>Component</td> <td>Variance</td>         </tr>         <tr>                 <td>PCA 1</td> <td>79.0%</td>         </tr>  <tr>                 <td>PCA 2</td> <td>17.6%</td>         </tr> <tr>                 <td>PCA 3</td> <td>2.7%</td>         </tr> </table></center> </tr></td></table></center><BR> The table needs a modern browser to display its excesses.     tom @ emerald  3/26/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>240-1</STRONG>     You are skipping a step, I think. SIR-C data  are in a compressed format, which you need to decompress to make byte format images. Then you can import them into a program such as ERDAS Imagine. You should have received the decompression software (DCOMP) with the CEOS reader. If not, contact me via email and we will send it out. Sounds like the product you have is 5 bytes/pixel, hence the record length 23020 = 5 * 4604 pixels. This would be a 2-channel image (e.g., mode 11, LHH & LHV). 2/16/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

Make sure your viewer  software (such as JPEGView) has enough memory allocated for a file this big. 2/20/96<ADDRESS>Jeff Plaut, SIR-C Project, JPL, plaut@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>247-1</STRONG>     you need to run the dcomp program to synthesize a byte image, and then import this file to Erdas Imagine (the image will be a raw image to import).  We are starting to deliver a new, simpler data format - We call them db byte images, in which the DN numbers correspond to DB power values.

As an experiment, I am going to include a link to the radar image data warehouse at Eros, the <a href="http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/sir-c/sir-c.html"> Eros Data Center (EDC)</a>, in this message.  If this works, my method was to simply imitate the html formating used for links when the bulletin board is 'viewed as source' in the Netscape browser, pasting in Eros' URL from my hotlist.  1/28/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>Tom Pringle, Emerald Imagery, tingalsb@oregon.uoregon.edu</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>15-1</STRONG>     Yes, this works.  Sort of.  JPL has set up the whole nine yards to be underlined so it is hard to tell that the Eros link does work in the original question.  While it is not my place to offer design changes to JPL's most excellent home page, bulletin board users who want to see a  little less underling in their question could submit it so that only the first word is the link to the responces.  From question 15, viewed as source, it is clear that inserting a terminator (/A, sandwiched by 'less than' and 'greater than' symbols) where the underlining should stop is enough. Then the links within their question would show up better.  Note that this is only necessary in submitted questions; in submitted responses where links would be more common, they show up fine.  1/28/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>15-2</STRONG>     We really like this idea of putting in links within the questions. We will probably change the format so that the whole question is not underlined, so that it is more clear where a link is... 1/30/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, Jet propulsion laboratory, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>15-3</STRONG>     as shown in the response to question 1-10, if you put in a  link to something within the imaging radar home page, don't forget that you have to specify the path, including the top "/", or it won't link correctly.  If it is a link outside of the imaging radar home page, then you don't have to worry about that. 1/30/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>15-4</STRONG>     I would like to inclose small graphics as well as links in my responses .  However, "Submit a Response" does not seem to accept pasted graphics.  Can JPL give us a stable directory path to a folder where we might ftp our images with Fetch, then cite in question or response links?  Or would you rather we did these links to our own home pages?<P>I see where someone has done an end run around the name-affiliation-email paperwork by creating a single paste 'send mail' trigger link in question 22.  Can you set things up so all email addresses are provided like this automatically? 2/ 1/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>15-5</STRONG>     Well, I'm not sure.  I am not sure if the link in 22 was manually input.  It might only be a netscape feature.  It may be possible if the netscape software can handle it... 2/ 1/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>15-6</STRONG>     So far as linking in graphics at the bulletin board, this is certainly an interesting idea... 2/ 1/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>15-7</STRONG>     After talking it over, we have decided not to enable linking small graphics into the bulletin board with the img src html command, as then we start having to worry about the amount of disk space that we would have to allocate for this (once it is in a question, we have to keep the image as long as we keep the message).  And then there is the problem of inappropriate images.  As it is, you can put a link to an image, you just have to click.  If you have an  image that you would like everyone to see, then send me an email, and we can possibly put it into the <a href="/user.html">user contribution section</a> for everyone to see. 2/ 6/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>15-8</STRONG>     How do you feel about bb users submitting html tables?

<BR><STRONG>150-1</STRONG>     it is possible... 10/24/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>150-2</STRONG>     ..one major problem is many modern mines are made from plastics, cerams etc, ie: "*hard* to detect" materials, as they are designed to *avoid* detection  when deployed. Norw. mine removal aid organizations tend to prefer the  proven good old bayonet when searching and recovering/removing them.  A more brutal and effective approach is a recent innovation involving a  modified tank used to trigger the mines explosive charges by using a giant "steel brush" to carve up the soil in which the mines buried/deployed. 10/27/95<ADDRESS>Arnt Karlsen, none, arnt@hsr.no</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>150-3</STRONG>     There are as many technologies needed for UXO (as some say for unexploded ordnance) as there are devices out there.  While many recent mine fields have largely non-metallic devices, there are many, many other situations where there are metallic ordnance. Recently in France unexploded gas shells from  World War I have been corroding through and realeasing still-active mustards, etc.  In the US mustards in glass vials have recently been excavated from a military dump that was unrecorded. One estimate to clean up this stuff in the US runs to $18 billion--and that leaves out the millions of acres of foreign lands. I am sure that radar--and other electromagnetic approaches-- will have a significant role in the future. That radar may be in a plane  doing a local, high-resolution search, or even on the ground searching an immediate area. Those guys with the bayonets have a hard, hard life. In Africa some are paying a bounty for each device--with no workman's compensation. The UN has, I'm told, used peacekeeping soldiers for such work to open roads. Talk about dedication! 11/ 8/95<ADDRESS>William H. Reid, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, wh_reid@ccmail.pnl.gov</ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>159-1</STRONG>     Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is developing products that use GPS to give continuing locations on a (visual) map overlay. I don't see why it could not be coupled to a oral readout, but development would be required. This might be useful for people following regular, urban routes. Radar is a logical  next step, but I don't have immediate info on that. I can point you to the GPS people. Bill 11/ 8/95<ADDRESS>William H. Reid, Battelle PNL, wh_reid@ccmail.pnl.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>159-2</STRONG>     There are very small and cheap ($30-50) hand-held ultra-sound distance measurement equipments available.  They are used in building construction work, for example (at least in Finland).  It immediately gives you the distance from the target pointed, with an accuracy of few centimeters up to distances about 20 meters.  This + DGPS would be a good solution, GPS giving the location on map and ultra-sound probe giving the idea of obstacles near you.  2/ 1/96<ADDRESS>teemu.tares@jrc.it</ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>155-1</STRONG>     I am a grad student at the University of Texas at Austin.  Try looking at the home page for our Center for Space Research.  Even if you don't find what you are looking for in our www site, consider contacting the center.  There are people here who do precision orbit determination for ERS-1.   http://ftp.csr.utexas.edu/csr_data/data_files_lib.html   11/ 9/95<ADDRESS>Clint Slatton, Center for Space Research, slatton@poseidon.csr.utexas.edu</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>155-2</STRONG>     Hi there! Ive written one or two ERS-1 SAR processors and have written ERS-1  orbit simulators. the position of the satellite is tracked  using laser retro- reflectors as the satellite passes over one of ESA's ground stations. The  official ESA specs for their precision orbit data is given as 920 metres along track; 15 metres across track and 30 metres in the radial direction. It must be  noted that ive found the precision data to be *MUCH* more accurate than this. 11/17/95<ADDRESS>Darren Muff, Defence Research Agency, Malvern, Great Britain., dgm@sar.dra.hmg.gb</ADDRESS>
<BR><STRONG>157-1</STRONG>     Very much doubt it.  If the ordnance is metallic, I think your best bet is metal detector technology: this has been brought to a fine art by many companies throughout the world.  One of the most practical systems is marketed by Barcom of South Africa.  However, this is all stuff  which operates on the surface. There is also a great deal of work relating to using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) for this purpose.  However, GPR is limited by soil conductivity.  Wet clay will restrict penetration to a few cm! There has been some work using high resoltion airborne SAR which has located metallic mines in **very** ideal conditions.  There was a recent SPIE conference on this topic: the proceedings would be a good departure point. 11/15/95<ADDRESS>Michael Inggs, Dept Electrical Eng, University of Cape Town, mikings@eleceng.uct.ac.za</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>157-2</STRONG>     Also see the responses the Question 150. 11/16/95<ADDRESS>Ellen O'Leary, JPL Radar Data Center</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>157-3</STRONG>     GPR might work at lower frequencies (10 MHz)... big antenna though.  SAR might detect an area of disturbed soil if the dielectric constant vaires greatly with the undisturbed area.  Also the disturbed area would have to be rather large > 20m2  3/15/96<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 07:<STRONG>      The current (2/95) issue of Scientific American contains a short piece (Pp. 18) on JPL's collaboration with French Scientists in the development of radar "interferograms" for use in mapping deformations in the earth arising from  earthquakes.  I'd like to know the technical details of the technique. Have there been any publications, or are there materials available on the WWW that will help? Please reply to me at allanb@jupiter.uoregon.edu.  Thank you.  Allan Branscomb  </STRONG><ADDRESS>Allan B.

<STRONG>07-2</STRONG>     The only paper to my knowledge that discusses details of the technique is " On the derivation of coseismic displacement fields using differential radar interferometry: The landers earthquake. JGR v99 nB10 pp19617-19634 Oct 1994, by Zebker et al. The original publication of the differential interferometric method is Gabriel et al. JGR 1989 v94 pp9183-9191.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 04:<STRONG>      Under the science and applications section, users of radar data  may submit results that they have obtained for access by the users of the imaging radar home page.  Under user contributions, I will put your html and/or gif/jpeg images for browsing.  Those interested should contact me by email.</STRONG><ADDRESS>bruce chapman, JPL, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>04-1</STRONG>     I think this is a really good idea.  There are a zillion directions to go off in for 5-channel enhancements -- it would be fun to see what others can come up with since nobody has time to explore them all.  To be helpful, enhancement goals, software used, and enhancement steps taken need to be articulated and perhaps edited for consistency. I propose that JPL create a contest (with prizes of course) to see who is the most inventive and skillful at extracting information or making an educational point from radar imaging data.  This would consist of posting, say,  all channels of some scene at 200K x 5 = 1 meg, setting an enhancement objective, a time frame, a panel of judges,  and incentives (CD-ROMs of radar data?).  Many of us could productively waste time on this at work because our screens would look okay. 1/28/95<ADDRESS>Tom Pringle, Emerald Imagery, tingalsb@oregon.uroegon.edu</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>04-2</STRONG>     I think this is a great Idea!  I spoke with Tony Freeman about it and he agreed.  We will try to put a contest like this together. I will be a bit busy for a couple of weeks on other things, but I  will try to organize something by the end of March.    By the way, we actually have 13 channels of data when we collect all channels (X-band 1 channel, L-band 4 channels, C-band 4 channels) so we will put all of them on-line, and then let the users have their hand at making some nice looking images!  I will announce it at whats new, and at the bulletin board. 1/30/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>04-3</STRONG>     correction (see question 20) .  I will put 7 channels of data on-line. (maybe only 6 if I can not get the corresponding x-band data.) 2/ 1/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>04-4</STRONG>     I think the grand prize should be a ride on the Shuttle  (provided the winner has the 'right stuff.') Or at least on the TOPSAR DC-8.  Not just some CD-ROM. 2/ 1/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 03:<STRONG>      Have you found any bugs in the JPL software?</STRONG><ADDRESS>Tony Freeman, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, tony.freeman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>03-1</STRONG>     This "Submit a Response" box is pretty.  I'd rather it scrolled down like a notepad weird on my Mac.  It just goes and goes to the right and I can't see what I just wrote.<ADDRESS>Tom Pringle, Emerald Imagery, tingalsb@oregon.uoregon.edu</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>03-2</STRONG>     Unfortunately, that is a property of the forms. 1/26/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>03-3</STRONG>     Solution A:  Stub in the following html code to JPL home page after <P>Enter your question or comment in this box:  <TEXTAREA NAME="question" ROWS=6 COLS=110></TEXTAREA>  Solution B:  Mac Netscape users can View>Source... to open Simple Text, start writing at bottom, then paste into comment box. 1/27/95<ADDRESS>anonymous</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>03-4</STRONG>     In 03-3, the stub-in code got taken too literally as html, not text.  Intended change just sets columns to 110, which makes text box appropriate for an average screen  and drops it to its own line.  The larger box is easier to work in.  1/27/95<ADDRESS>anonymous</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>03-5</STRONG>     I think this is what was meant above: <em>I took the liberty of editing this out, as I found it confusing.  basically, this person put in a response box of 110 columns.  We have changed the size of the response box to 80 characters (bc)</em><ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>03-6</STRONG>     It might be nice to have a cancel or edit option at the point where the user sees how a given question or response is going to look. Here's an easy workaround (surf your own hard drive): view the current page as source.  This opens the SimpleText editor. Select All and Cut.  This gives a blank slate.  Write out the question or response.  Save As anything.html to the desktop.  Back in Netscape, Open File and double click on your new .html document.  View the document just as it will appear on the JPL home page.  Save changes as needed.  Copy and paste into the 'Submit Comments box and submit! 2/ 1/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>03-7</STRONG>     I changed the width of the text area from 60 to 80 chars. Hope this helps. 2/ 2/95<ADDRESS>Sharon Okonek, JPL, sharon.okonek@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>

<STRONG>01-10</STRONG>     A modest suggestion for a wonderfully constructed web site:  would it be possible to web-ize the 381K document about the scientists and their proposals <a href="missiono.html#RTFToC1">I.  INTRODUCTION</a> i.e., break it up into smaller documents?  The navigation is set up just fine, but it is all internal (within this one big file).  This will cause memory overload for many users.  Thanks  -- I really like the level of detail being provided! 1/29/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>01-11</STRONG>     I don't always see a name/address for a question response. Is this because the person was lazy and didn't fill out the id info? How about automatically getting their email address at least?  1/30/95<ADDRESS>Tom Farr, JPL, tom.farr@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>01-12</STRONG>     in reply to 1-10, I will try to break the mission overview document into smaller sections, so that it does not take so long to  load it.  in reply to 1-11, yes, it was because the person for whatever reason elected to not say who they were.  unfortunately, there is no way to get someones email address automatically. 1/30/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>01-13</STRONG>     also with respect to 1-10, if you want to put a link to a location within the imaging radar home page, be sure to put in the whole path, for instance, <a href="/missiono.html">introduction</a> is how the above link should read. (don't forget the / as the top directory) 1/30/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>01-14</STRONG>     I found a pretty decent glossary for many of the radar and satellite acronyms at <a href= "http://ericir.syr.edu/NASA/glossary.html"> Syracuse University's radar education project</a >.  <i><a href="mailto:tingalsb@oregon.uregon.edu">tom pringle/emerald imagery</a></i> 2/ 1/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>01-15</STRONG>     Actually, what you have put a link to above, is from the <a href="/sirced.html">SIR-C education Cd-ROM </a> that  is online at the ASKERIC site at syracuse univerisity 2/ 1/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>01-16</STRONG>     A great resource!  Thank you.  I found answers to questions and posted others on my very first visit to the BB.  One of the best I have used.  Please keep up the great work. 2/14/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>01-17</STRONG>     An extremely usefull resource. Congratulations.  6/ 2/95<ADDRESS>Dr. Nickolaos Soulakellis, Dept. of HUMAN GEOGRAPHY, Univ. of the AEGEAN/ GREECE, nsoul@geo.aegean.gr</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>01-18</STRONG>     Thanks to JPL for providing this service! After all, what good is  remote sensing data if the user community doesn't understand how to use it?   I Do have a suggestion, albeit a minor one. I find the blinking text to be very distracting when I'm trying to read a post. Can this be surpressed, or discouraged?   -Tom   9/18/95<ADDRESS>Tom Albright, Institute for Computational Earth System Science, albright@geog.ucsb.edu</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>01-19</STRONG>     my browser (netscape 1.1) does not have any blinking text in the bulletin board - is this a configuration option with your browser? 10/ 3/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>01-20</STRONG>     I work for the Massachusetts Museum of  Contemporary Art in North Adams, Mass, and  I'd really like to set up a similar Q&A board  on our web site. Is there a program available that  could run this type of thing on our server?  3/11/96<ADDRESS>Doug Bartow, Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, doug@massmoca.org</ADDRESS>

Therefore, one thing you could do is to  download some of the images that are on this home page at Southport.JPL.NASA.GOV. Furthermore, you can access the quick look data from the SIR-C mission via a link from this home page.  You will find a lot of the quick look data will be useful for your presentation. Dan with  5/17/95<ADDRESS>Dan Blumberg, Arizona State University, Blumberg@ASUWS2.LA.ASU.EDU</ADDRESS>

<STRONG>07-3</STRONG>     Since you now have a post to the education bulletin board (response to question 2), I assume that this is no longer a problem...perhaps the net was slow at the time, and it was taking awhile to post? 3/21/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>07-4</STRONG>     Bruce:   I have had NO LUCK in posting a Question.  True, the response worked OK but I am unable to type and send the offer for the PA Lab as a statement in the  send question box. I wonder if that is why there are so few remarkes on the Educator BB ?  Can you type my stuff in it for me ? 3/23/95<ADDRESS>Bill again</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>07-5</STRONG>     can you tell me what browser you are using?  I just posted a message from my Mac with netscape with no problem...in the meantime, what do you want me to post ? 3/24/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>07-6</STRONG>     Bruce,  I am using EI Net at the moment, just because my hotlist includes this page. (We have Mosaic, MacWeb & Netscape as well)  If you could type my offer #45 onto the Education Bulletin Board, I would appreciate it. I will try Netscap next. Thanx.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 06:<STRONG>      How can I use radar for high school student? What kind of equipment do I need to use this data set?</STRONG><ADDRESS>Andy V. Tran, andy@grumpy.jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>06-1</STRONG>     The SIR-C Project has created an Educational CD-ROM called the SIR-CED.  This CD contains radar images and tutorials that allow students to learn about the uses of radar. There is a detailed write up on the CD-ROM on the "radar remote sensing education" section of the Imaging Radar Home Page. This section describes the CD-ROM and gives information regarding ordering copies for use in the classroom.  Also mentioned in this section is the type of computer equipment needed to display the images from the CD. 1/26/95<ADDRESS>Shannon L. McConnell, SIR-C Project</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>06-2</STRONG>     I have been using the SIR-CED disk since this last summer with high school students and I have developed a unit around the Pennsylvannia image.  The week-long computer lab exploration uses the Radar Image and Landsat and digital photographs to show students the problems of Coal Mining and the problem of Acid Mine Waste.

But,it took a lot of time to modify the lessons so the Questions were separate from the discussions.  When you Xerox140 copies, you want only the answer sheets individual, not allthe introductory and explainatory materials. ( These can be doneas a classroom set, saving a lot of time and paper.)  Otherwise,the surface truth and shuttle pictures added a great deal to theusefulness of the SIR images, and we would hope to see more units developed - eg. Death Valley. 3/21/95<ADDRESS>William M.

<H1>Responses to...</H1>QUESTION 01:<STRONG>      Any comments about this bulletin board, or the educational materials that we have provided at the imaging radar home page? 2/16/95</STRONG><ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS><BR><STRONG>01-1</STRONG>     Hi, I'm a doctoral student at The Catholic University of America, Washington DC.  My research partner and I are working on a hypermedia presentation on the use of hypermedia in education. Is there any chance we could get one of your radar imaging movies in either flattened QuickTime or .AVI format?  (we're working in MultiMedia ToolBook, and it doesn't  support MPEG format). Thanks for taking the time to read my message! 3/ 7/95<ADDRESS>Arlin H. Adams, Education Dept., The Catholic University of America, ahadams@ix.netcom.com</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>01-2</STRONG>     Normally, we support the mpeg format on the home page due to the public domain software that is available for viewing this format.  However, if you contact Jay Trimble at jtrimble@jpljpt.jpl.nasa.gov, he may be able to help you... 3/ 8/95<ADDRESS>bruce chapman, jpl, bruce.chapman@jpl.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>01-3</STRONG>     Yes, I would like to see a <blink> location road map </blink> accompany the Death Valley image portfolio.  Rectangles would show what the various radar images covered.  The scale would imply image scales and orientations.  For example, the <a href="/airsardvimages.html">AIRSAR Death Valley Images</a> extends northeasterly from Panamint Valley across Death Valley all the way over to Beatty, Nevada, whereas the <A HREF="/jpeg/dv/dv10141n.jpg">SIR-C </A> centers a smaller area in the sand dunes.  The image caption only specifies the latitude as 36¼ and longitude as 117¼, which in these parts is 35 x 60 miles, creating a 70x ambiguity in location.  I couldn't locate the TOPSAR DEM at all.  <P> Because Death Valley is an important calibration site and accessible for ground-truthing, it might be worthwile to thoroughly interpret one of the images, i.e., put arrows to the reflectors, point out the Cottonwood Creek alluvial fan, dunes, soil textures, roads,  etc.  I recommending doing the interpretive work over the AIRSAR image with L, C, P assembled as an RGB in Photoshop and possibly run through a K-means classifer seperately.  A lot of folks need a jumpstart in false color photo-interpretation. <P> I know you people are busy so I went ahead and started in on these.  I sure wish the <A HREF="user.html">User contributions</A> page could accept images so I could post them or that there was an ftp site to put them so JPL could insert them at the right spot.  Hard drive space is only 30¢ a megabyte!  A 17" screenful is only 3¢ worth in storage costs.   <P>  Also, please remember our monitors are 4:3 [width to height] so images should be rotated to landscape position to minimize scrolling. <P> tom@emerald 3/20/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>01-4</STRONG>     We really appreciate it when someone works on things like this, because we really don't have time to do many interesting projects.  With respect to the user contribution section, the problem with setting up an anonymous ftp site for home page contributions is that we would potentially lose control of the contents (even if only for a short time).  Someone could post something unacceptable to JPL, or someone could use the disk space to store inappropriate items, or I could get swamped with items and run out of disk space.  disk space may be cheap, but I still have to plan how much I will need.  Publishing a home page is kind of like publishing a magazine, we need to edit what appears. This bulletin board I hope goes a little beyond that, but even here, I would edit any  inappropriate item out of the bb. 3/21/95<ADDRESS></ADDRESS>
<STRONG>01-5</STRONG>     "Southport" server couldn't be located when I submitted my first question to yr  fine bb.  Still want to put my Q out there!  This was my msg to myself.  Maybe  it cd be answered thro this URL.......?  Submitted q not accepted at: http://southport/cgi-bin/bb-SubmitQuestion_ed.pl  [Can nayone tell me how to go about getting the JPL SIRCED  CD-ROM, or at least how to view the images on the net?  I'm  new to this!   Many thanks.] 12/27/95<ADDRESS>Justin Wilkinson, Space Shuttle Earth Observations, NASA-JSC, wilkinson@snmail.jsc.nasa.gov</ADDRESS>
<STRONG>01-6</STRONG>     Along with our requests for the SIR-C EDUCATIONAL CD-ROM, we are receiving many requests for additional educational information and other miscellaneous NASA information. We really don't have anything to fill these requests. Could you advise on what to do with these requests. All we have to give them is some informational booklets and brocheres on the DAAC user services. Any help or advice would be much appreciated. Please respond to my e-mail address: kaufman@edcdgs10.cr.usgs.gov         Thanks!   10/29/96<ADDRESS>Jason Kaufman, EDC DAAC User Services, kaufman@edcdgs10.cr.usgs.gov</ADDRESS>

The Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) is the 
most advanced imaging radar system to have flown in Earth orbit.  Carried in the 
cargo bay of the Space Shuttle Endeavour in April and October, 1994,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

simultaneously recorded
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data at three wavelengths (L-, C-, and X-bands; 23.5, 5.8 and 3.1 
cm, respectively). In addition, the full polarimetric scattering matrix was obtained 
by the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
instrument at L- and C-band over a variety of terrain and vegetation 
types.  The integrated system is steerable in look angle (electronically in the case of 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a>, 
 mechanically in the case of X-SAR) to obtain data in the angular range of 
15 -60 .  Imaging resolution varies from about 10 to 50 meters, depending on the 
geometry and data taking configuration. Over the two flights, a total of 143 hours (93 terabits) 
of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data were digitally recorded on tape for subsequent processing in the U.S., 
Germany, and Italy. During the October 1994 flight of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a>, 
 over one million 
square kilometers of repeat-pass
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
interferometry data were also obtained.  <BR>
 <BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
is a cooperative experiment between the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA), the German space agency, Deutsche Agentur f&uuml;r Raumfahrtangelegenheiten 
(DARA), and the Italian Space Agency, Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI).
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. X-SAR was developed by the Dornier 
and Alenia Spazio companies, with the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt f&uuml;r Luft- und Raumfahrt 
(DLR), the major partner in science, operations, and data processing. The experiment provides an evolutionary step in NASA's Spaceborne Imaging Radar (SIR) program that 
began with the Seasat
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
in 1978, and continued with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-A">SIR-A</a> 
in 1981 and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-B">SIR-B</a> 
in 
1984. It also represents a continuation of Germany's imaging radar program which 
started with the Microwave Remote Sensing Experiment (MRSE) flown aboard the Shuttle on the 
first SPACELAB mission in 1983.<BR>
<BR>
The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
Science Team consisting of 52 investigator teams from more than a 
dozen countries are using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data in studies of geology, hydrology, ecology, 
oceanography. Other investigations are focused on topics in
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
calibration and electromagnetic theory.  In addition, interferometric data from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
are being used 
for  topographic mapping, and surface change monitoring connected with tectonism, 
volcanism and glacier ice motion.  <BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data provide unique information for studying the health of the planet 
and its biodiversity, as well as critical data for natural hazards and resource assessments. 
 The following papers summarize science results from the two flights of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a>. 
 This report contains 44 investigator team reports and several additional reports 
from co-investigators and other researchers.   At the time of this writing, processing 
and analysis of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data are continuing.  Since the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
flights in 
1994, hundreds of additional investigators have accessed
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data for studies 
as diverse as archeology, land-use, and resource management indicating that new findings 
and discoveries can be expected from this rich and varied data set for many years 
to come.<BR>

Multifrequency, Multipolarization External Calibration of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
Radars<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Assess the accuracy at which the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
standard data products can be calibrated
through the use of ground calibrators to estimate the end-to-end system polarization
calibration constants (or distortion parameters) and incorporate the constants into
the data processing.<BR>
<BR>
Study the cross-calibration between three multipolarization systems:
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a>, 
 the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA/JPL)
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DC-8">DC-8</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a>, 

and the University of Michigan ground-based polarimetric scatterometer.<BR>
<BR>
Evaluate the calibration "stability" of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
(measured by variations in the
calibration constants) over the range swath width and over a specified distance in
azimuth.  Variations over a 12-hour period (between ascending and descending passes)
will also be studied.<BR>
<BR>
Develop a cost-effective calibration plan including development of inexpensive polarimetric
active calibrators.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
- during the two
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
missions, ground calibration equipment was deployed at
the Death Valley supersite. Equipment included over 30 corner reflectors, six transponders
and ground-based receivers. The transponders included two single antenna polarimetric active radar calibrator (SAPARC) devices developed by our co-investigator team
at the U. of Michigan. The Principal Investigator's (PI's) team also participated
in deployment of corner reflectors at the Manaus, Brazil supersite. In a collaborative
effort with a team from the Institute of Navigation of the University of Stuttgart, high-precision
transponders and ground receivers, similar to those at the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DLR">DLR</a> 
Oberpfaffenhofen test
site, were deployed at the Chickasha, Oklahoma supersite. Corner reflectors and instructions/guidelines for their deployment were also distributed to PI's at several
other supersites.<BR>
<BR>
During the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
missions, information on the location and configuration of the calibration
devices deployed at participating supersites was relayed by PI's back to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>. 
  These
data were used to 'manually' calibrate
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data products during the actual missions. Calibrated
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data were then passed on to the &quot;real-time&quot; science team,
to be processed into geophysical products such as soil moisture, biomass and land
cover maps.<BR>
<BR>
Thus far, over 50
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
scenes have been processed and analyzed which contain corner
reflectors or other calibration devices, or which represent suitably uniform scenes
to verify the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
antenna patterns.<BR>
<BR>
Working in collaboration with B. van den Broek of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#FEL-TNO">FEL-TNO</a> 
of the Netherlands, an algorithm
which fits a simple set of scattering models to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data has been applied to data
from the Flevoland supersite and the Manaus supersite. The results of the model fit have been used as the basis of an unsupervised classifier which divides
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data
up into several different land use categories.<BR>
<BR>
The University of Michigan team were involved in a calibration campaign in the Raco
Calibration Supersite. In each calibration campaign an array of point calibration
targets including trihedral corner reflectors and polarimetric active radar calibrators
(PARCs) were deployed. For this project two types of calibration targets for imaging
radars were invented: (1) single antenna polarimetric active radar calibrator (SAPARC),
and (2) self-illuminating optimum corner reflector. In addition to the deployment
of point calibration targets, polarimetric backscatter measurements of distributed targets
were collected using L-, C-, and X-band polarimetric, truck-mounted, scatterometer
systems during the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
flights. The scatterometers were calibrated against a precision metallic sphere and measured 100 independent spatial samples for characterizing
the differential Mueller matrix of  distributed targets to achieve the desired calibration
accuracy. The measured Mueller matrices of the distributed targets are intended to be compared with those derived from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
images. Two different calibration methods,
one based on the application of point targets and the other based on the application
of the distributed targets, are considered for calibration of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data. So
far, some encouraging preliminary results for two C-band images of the first mission
have been obtained.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Summary and research plans for the next two years, including anticipated new data
requests and new publications.<BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
- Radiometric calibration results and uncertainties for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data so far have
been assessed from corner reflector signatures, which have inherent uncertainties
of their own.  We intend to revise our estimates of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
radiometric calibration
performance by examining signatures of transponders and tropical rain forest areas, which
should have smaller variations. The results will be published as a communication
in a refereed journal.  <BR>
<BR>
A study has begun in collaboration with Dr. Francesco Holecz of the University of
Zurich (currently seconded to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>) 
 to study the radiometric calibration errors in

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data over areas with significant relief. The study involves registration of

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data with a high-resolution
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a>, 
 correction for the 'true' incidence angle and elevation
angle, and the comparison of fully corrected backscatter values with the original

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data. It is also intended to study the radiometric errors caused by using a
lower-resolution
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 
to correct the data. The results of this aspect of the study will have
implications for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-3">SRL-3</a> 
data, should that mission be manifested. The results of our
collaboration with Dr. Holecz will be published in a refereed journal paper or papers.<BR>
<BR>
In collaboration with Dr. van den Broek, we will continue to develop the model-fitting
approach to understanding polarimetric
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a>. 
 We intend
to pursue an avenue of adaptive model-fitting, in which for example, areas which
are clearly dominated by surface scatter will be subjected to higher-order surface scatter
models, areas which are clearly forested will be subjected to higher-order forest
scatter models, and so on. This will probably involve a two-layer approach, in which
the L- and C-band
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data is used in an initial classification, followed by a higher-order
model fit to give better estimates of surface properties. This will then be applied
to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data from several different sites around the world. The result will be a
generalized model-fit/simple classification software package and a refereed journal
paper describing the approach, which should be applicable to any L- and C-band
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 

data set.<BR>
<BR>
The University of Michigan team will process the backscatter data collected with the
truck-mounted scatterometer and compare with measurements extracted from calibrated

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR products. All the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR data available over the Raco supersite will be orthorectified using a modified version of a software package developed
by Vexcel Corporation. This will make exact identification of the sites measured
by the scatterometer much simpler, and lead to improved comparison data. The University
of Michigan team will also study the effects of applying different calibration algorithms
to the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data. The output of this analysis will be used to refine our estimates
of calibration uncertainties in
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data. The University of Michigan team
will also construct and test a prototype of a &quot;next-generation&quot; corner reflector they have
designed. The results of the University of Michigan team's investigations will be
published as a series of refereed journal papers.<BR>

Inflight Antenna Pattern Measurement for SIR-C<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Obtain the vertical antenna patterns of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
radars to allow improved radiometric
calibration of data for other investigators.<BR>
<BR>
To determine how much the vertical antenna pattern changes after launch to aid in
designing future space radars and to determine if such measurements are needed on
all future space radars.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
The University of Kansas Radar Systems and Remote Sensing Laboratory is studying the
elevation pattern of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR antennas using backscatter from homogeneous
targets.  Specific passes were requested and obtained over the Amazon rain forest,
the world's largest homogenous flat forest area.  In addition, passes over the Amazon
area requested by other investigators are useful for this purpose.<BR>
<BR>
We now have patterns for both
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR antennas from some of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
passes,
but not all.  The patterns obtained are for a limited set of conditions because the
antenna has many modes 
   (<a href="Acronyms.html#VV">VV</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#HV">HV</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#VH">VH</a> 
at each frequency of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a>, 
 with 10 beam-spoiling modes).  Too few passes are available to test the various beam-spoiling modes.
For X-SAR, which has only one mode, we have a complete pattern and published the
results {Fang and Moore, 1995}.<BR>
<BR>
The X-SAR pattern obtained is close to that used in correcting the data.  For some

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
modes the pattern is close, but not as close as the X-SAR in most cases.  For
the one beam-spoiled mode we have studied, there is a major inconsistency between<BR>
<BR>
* beamwidth in tape header,<BR>
* beamwidth from radiometric correction table,<BR>
* beamwidth from our calculations.<BR>
<BR>
For no beam spoiling, we find differences between our measured one-way pattern and
the radiometric table up to about 1 dB at the edges of the swath.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
The use of radar returns from large homogeneous areas requires selection of areas
that are flat and, at least in the average, uniform in content.  They should be flat
so that slope effects on radar backscatter do not distort the data.  The Amazon rain
forest is the largest flat, homogeneous area in the world, so it was selected as the primary
area for pattern determination.  However, images of the rain forest show that low
hills occur in some places, and in this case, we exclude the hilly areas from processing.<BR>
<BR>
Areas that are largely homogeneous frequently contain regions with signals greatly
different from the average; examples are water bodies and cities.  We remove the
effect of these by preparing a histogram of the signals.  If the histogram is multimodal,
with a low mode for water, a large central region, and possibly a high mode for cities,
the points in the upper and lower modes are excluded from the analysis.  Some images
show rivers that are at essentially constant range; these cannot be used because
the river return at a given range would leave to few forest returns to get a valid point
at that range.<BR>
<BR>
We then average the remaining data in long strips; each strip is 100-1000 m wide and
as long as the useful part of the image (typically tens of km).  Each strip corresponds
to a particular angle off the beam center.  The average power in the strips is then plotted vs. beam angle.  At this point we fit the data with an appropriate function.
Although we have used quadratic and quartic polynomial fits, the best fit comes
from a form<BR>
<BR>

<center>
G(f) = d cos<sup>b</sup> [c(f-a)].<BR>
</center>

<BR>
The best-fit function is then used to determine the beamwidth,  This can be compared
with the beamwidth given in the tape header.  Moreover, we can plot the pattern using
this beamwidth and the theoretical shape to find how the measured pattern deviates
from that reported in the header.<BR>
<BR>
A third pattern source is available; the radiometric correction table used in processing
the data.  This is also provided on the tapes.  We also plot and measure a beamwidth
for this information.  By plotting all four curves (measured, fit to measured, header-stated, and radiometric correction), we can compare results at each angle in the
beam to see how large errors might be using one of the curves based on preflight
measurements and calculations.<BR>
<BR>
Table 1 summarizes the results for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a>. 
  The beamwidths are reasonably
close, but never identical for LVV and LHH with no beam spoiling.  They are not quite
as close for C-band.  Note that our beamwidths are smaller than the header beamwidth
for L-band, but larger for C-band.  The only beam-spoiled pass we had available was
78.60.  The differences between the three beamwidths are quite large for this case.
It appears that the header value may have been taken from a beam-spoil-zero mode
table, whereas both measured and radiometric correction beamwidths are more than twice as
large as that reported on the header.  Note also that the differences between measured
and radiometric correction beamwidths are rather large in this case, suggesting that
the correction was inadequate at the edges of the beam.<BR>
<BR>
Fig. 1 shows one of the better cases, where the three fits are not far apart.  Even
here the difference between our measured pattern and the radiometric correction is
about 0.6 dB at the edge of the beam (2-way difference would be 1.2 dB).<BR>
<BR>
Fig. 2 shows the bad beam-spoiled case.  The difference between our pattern and the
radiometric correction is not too bad, but the pattern based on the header is not
even close.  Unfortunately, this only beam-spoiled case was for a rather narrow swath
(in terms of percent of the beam width), so the fits over the entire beam are not as reliable
as they would be if the data covered a wider part of the beam.<BR>
<BR>
We requested
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
tapes, but have not received any to date.<BR>
<BR>
The same method was used to determine the X-SAR pattern.  The results were very close
to the predicted pattern, as shown in our paper (Fang and Moore, 1995).  X-SAR images
were obtained for all passes for which
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
images were requested.  However, some
of them were not usable.<BR>
<BR>
The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
patterns we obtained for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
are moderately close to those from the beamwidths
in the tape headers and the radiometric correction tables when there is no beam spoiling.
For the one beam-spoiled tape available, the beamwidth in the header is obviously very wrong, and the radiometric correction differs quite a bit from our measured
pattern.  Based on this limited information, we would warn users that beam-spoiled
data may have poor radiometric quality.  A report has been prepared that gives the
details of these results and comparisons.<BR>
<BR>
The measured X-SAR patterns for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
agree well with the values used in data processing.
As with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a>, 
 we have no data tapes processed.  Some tapes arrived just as this
report was being written.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
We plan to obtain as complete a set of patterns as possible for the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
mission.
We also plan to revisit
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
to determine if suitable non-Amazon targets will let
us get patterns for different beam-spoiling modes.  This may be difficult, as most
of the supersites fail either the homogeneity test or the flatness test, or both.<BR>
<BR>
A main purpose of this effort is to improve the radiometric data for other users.
We hope that our first report will allow some modification to the patterns used
for no beam spoiling.  We have insufficient data to help much for passes where beam
spoiling was used, but at least we can provide information that serves as a warning to users
of such data.  We intend to publish a short paper on the preliminary results after

   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
personnel have had a chance to review the report.<BR>
<BR>
We plan to process all of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
data, when they become available,  as we did the

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
data.  We will then prepare reports and papers presenting the results.<BR>
<BR>
Because of the paucity of C-band data and data with beam spoiling, we will devote
special effort to identifying passes at C-band with various polarizations from other
possible useful targets.  We will also try to find passes with beam spoiling in<BR>
areas that may allow pattern determination.<BR>

Passive and Active Calibrators for Multifrequency and Multiangle X-SAR/SIR-C Image
Radiometric and Geometric Corrections<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Prove that despite the considerable number of variables contributing to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

image formation, the data can reveal system descriptors by studying the system response
to "known targets" (either point-like or extended) within the scene.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
The analysis of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data started from our previous work and airborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
campaigns
in preparation for the April and October 1994 spaceborne missions. Our attention
was focused on the data sets gathered during several passages over the Calibration
Backup supersite CB1 (Matera, Southern Italy).  The main purpose of the experiment
is to prove that, despite the considerable number of variables contributing to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

image formation, the data can reveal system descriptors by studying the system response to &quot;known targets&quot; (either point-like or extended) within the scene.  To this
end, the authors have been designing and developing passive and active L-, C- and
X-band calibrators, which were used to instrument approximately 10 square kilometers
of the Matera test site, and were accurately located with respect to the geodetic network.
This instrumentation was accurately calibrated by using anechoic chamber measurements,
and successively tested and validated by means of airborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
campaigns 
   (<a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a>, 


   <a href="Acronyms.html#MAC">MAC</a> 
Europe 1991,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TOPSAR">TOPSAR</a>) 
.<BR>
<BR>
The step-by-step research program planned and developed in the past allowed us to
test and operate a set of ad-hoc multifrequency instrumentation for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
calibration
and data validation, as well as to implement effective radiometric calibration procedures.  The insight gained into
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
processing and calibration techniques is being validated
by analyzing
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data. In particular, we have available at our Department
the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SLC">SLC</a> 
(Single-Look Complex),
   <a href="Acronyms.html#MLD">MLD</a> 
(Multi-Look Detected) and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#RSD">RSD</a> 
(Reformatted Signal
Data) products for all the April 1994 passages of the sensor over the CB1 test site.

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data were acquired during the first half of 1995 from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
Radar Data
Center, whereas the I-PAF provided us with the X-SAR raw (RAW), single-look (SSC)
and multilook (MSD) images.  Analogous data requests for the October 1994 mission (SRL-2) are
going to be fulfilled by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#RDC">RDC</a> 
and the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#D-PAF">D-PAF</a>. 
<BR>
<BR>
As it will be explained in the following sections, we performed our analysis mainly
on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SLC">SLC</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#RSD">RSD</a> 
data, obtaining results in good agreement with pre-test measurements,
and which made us confident in the algorithms and techniques developed for the radar
data analysis and for the extraction of information from the processed
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images.<BR>
<BR>
<br>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
The main results of our investigations on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data concern high-precision
raw data processing and radiometric calibration by means of analysis on active point
targets 
   (<a href="Acronyms.html#ARC">ARC</a>, 
 Active Radar Calibrators) deployed on the Matera calibration supersite.
This is the preliminary step necessary to the creation of consistent data sets containing
information on biogeophysical information of the illuminated scene.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Further work on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data could be split into two main activities, namely,
high-precision processing for radiometric and geometric calibration, and repeat-pass
interferometry and polarimetric analysis.  In the following a short description of
the improvements envisaged for each activity will be given.  The first activity is the most
mature at this stage of research, and we will give short-term results, whereas the
other two activities are considered in a medium-long-term fashion.<BR>
<BR>
High-precision processing for radiometric and geometric calibration. Starting from
the encouraging quantitative results obtained from the raw data compression through
the simulation of the Shuttle mission, we intend to compare different data sets of
the same scene (CB1) processed by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
with the ones processed by means of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#2-D">2-D</a> 
reference
function provided by our
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
system simulator.  Besides some minor improvements of
the simulator, it will also be interesting to apply the procedure to focus all frequency bands and polarizations, and to evaluate a trade-off between the spatial range of
validity of the reference function and the computational efficiency in updating it.
Furthermore, more sophisticated interpolation techniques could be used to derive
the satellite dynamics starting from ancillary data and including orbital and attitude propagators.
This study could be connected to a theoretical analysis of the focusing errors induced
by inaccurate orbital data, allowing us to evaluate the influence of the ephemeris inaccuracies on selection of Doppler parameters required for range-Doppler
compression.  The activities described in this section will be conducted, as well
as the results so far attained, in the framework of the research program &quot;Airborne
and spaceborne interferometric
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data corrections for topographic applications&quot; approved
by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASA">NASA</a> 
within the Topography and Surface Change Program.  The authors intend to
apply the procedure to different data sets, frequencies and polarizations, in order
to produce comparative tables of results and study the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
system properties as a function
of time, frequency and polarimetric state.  Starting from the high-precision processed

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images, radiometric calibration and cross-calibration between frequencies and
polarizations will be performed with algorithms developed by the authors on the basis
of existing methods.  Emphasis will be given on applications of calibrated data:
for example, the ARC's responses will be used to estimate polarimetric imbalances
by applying suitable distortion models.  Moreover, we will analyze and extract the in-flight
azimuth antenna pattern by evaluating the ARCs' responses to the range-compressed
images, obtained by correlating the raw data with a simple range matched filter,
whose parameters will be derived from ancillary information.  We also intend to exploit the
different viewing geometries for different passes over the test site. The slight
shift between successive orbits, providing images of the area under different illumination
angles, would allow us to sample a portion of the in-flight range antenna pattern, and
possibly achieve fine tuning of processing parameters.  Another idea to be studied
is the reconstruction of the spacecraft trajectory by using the Doppler history of
the platform: encouraging results have been obtained by applying a coarse procedure to

   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
raw data, focused with a reference function  obtained  by  the  simulator
using  as  input  the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
Restituted  Orbit Data  and the <BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
Propagated State Vectors.<BR>
<BR>

Repeat-pass interferometry and polarimetric analysis.  Our group is primarily concerned
with focusing spaceborne interferometric pairs. Therefore, our future activities
will be devoted to verifying repeat-passes over Italian test sites with suitable
values of the baseline, in order to evaluate the potential of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
interferometry for topographic
mapping, by means of processing procedures based on point targets of known
   <a href="Acronyms.html#RCS">RCS</a>, 
 geographic
coordinates and phase behavior.  We are planning to study and exploit the availability of different polarimetric information for interferometry, and its effect
on the coherence of the output interferogram.  An interesting by-product of the coherence
analysis could be the study of the potential of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
interferometry for classification of terrain, together with the development of semi-automatic and automatic procedures
for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#2-D">2-D</a> 
phase unwrapping, in order to provide the end-user with consistent topographic
information and eventually improve the existing methods for phase-preserving
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
processing.  Data requests of possible interferometric passages over different
test sites (for example, the three passages over Mount Etna, Sicily, Italy of October
9, 10, and 11, 1994) are planned.<BR>

<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Integrate existing forest biophysical measurements with field measurements and calibrated
aircraft
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
and calibrated
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a>

<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Our
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
research has focused on forest backscatter modeling and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data
analysis for Loblolly pine forests at the Duke Forest Supersite.  In support of the
modeling and analysis,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#UCSB">UCSB</a> 
graduate students conducted a field study in Duke Forest
during the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
mission.  We are working in close collaboration with Eric Kasischke at
Duke University who has provided forest stand data.<BR>
<BR>
Data Acquisition/Analysis<BR>
<BR>
Single-look calibrated
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data for the ten available Duke Forest scenes have been
ordered and received at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#UCSB">UCSB</a>. 
  Four of the scenes are from the April mission, a time
of rapid leafing-out of trees and shrubs in Duke Forest, during which it rained on
three occasions.  Six scenes are from October, at which time the leaves had not yet fallen,
and ground conditions were much drier than in April.  X-SAR data has also been ordered
and received for nine scenes.<BR>
<BR>
The following data processing has been completed for all ten
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
scenes: Sub-images
of the Durham Division of the forest (the region for which stand data are the most
complete) have been processed into sigma-0 images (L- and C-bands, polarizations).
The sub-images have been imported into Arc-Info Grid.  An Arc-Info stand map (supplied
by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERIM">ERIM</a>) 
 has been registered to each scene. Backscatter statistics for approximately
70 stands have been extracted and summarized for each data take.  In our initial
analysis of the Duke
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data, we examined the backscatter statistics and trends in the
data series that might be explained by variations in incidence angle or changes in
forest conditions from day to day and season to season.  Other graphical analyses
done include comparisons of backscatter to stand age (and biomass) and comparisons of backscatter
from pairs of same-incidence angle data takes from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a>. 
  An analysis
of model predictions versus observed backscatter changes resulting from soil moisture changes is in progress.<BR>
<BR>
A study is under way on forest backscattering mechanisms, based on the radar target
decomposition method (Cloude, 1992; Van Zyl, 1994).  This study is presently based
on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data from floodplain swamp forest (Altamaha River, Georgia) and Ponderosa
pine forest (Mt. Shasta, California).  It may be extended to include
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data from Duke
Forest and Brazil.<BR>
<BR>
Although the Shasta data set is not as rich as the Duke set, there are six scenes
(including one of Mode 16) that include the Shasta site.  Therefore, we plan an analysis
of stand structure versus backscatter, utilizing our Shasta forest stand data.  One
Mt. Shasta scene has been ordered and received at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#UCSB">UCSB</a> 
and a second scene was ordered
recently.<BR>
<BR>
Forest Backscatter Modeling/Analysis<BR>
<BR>
The Santa Barbara microwave canopy backscatter model underwent continuing evolution
during 1994-95, with several improvements in coding and function.  Notably, the discontinuous
and continuous canopy models were integrated into a single program, and surface scattering models recently published by Oh et al. (1992, 1994) and Fung et al. (1992)
were incorporated.  Two modeling studies have been completed since 1994. In the first,
Loblolly pine stands ranging from &lt;1 to 14 kg/m<sup>2</sup> 
were modeled and the simulated backscatter was compared to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data.  In the second
study, Loblolly stands ranging from 8 to 60 years of age were modeled. Sensitivity
of backscatter from these stands to variations in surface roughness and soil moisture was evaluated by means of simulation.  Response of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
backscatter to soil moisture
changes is presently being compared with the simulation results.<BR>
<BR>
Field Work<BR>
<BR>
During the April
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
mission, a study of the forest floor in six Loblolly stands
in Duke Forest was carried out by

graduate students.  We were assisted by local
high school students, in coordination with Eric Kasischke's soil moisture study.
We measured surface roughness, soil moisture, and L-band dielectric constant, and litter
depth, density, and volumetric moisture content.  Some tree dielectric measurements
and observations of forest state were made near the time of shuttle overflights.<BR>

<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
We validated a canopy backscatter model for Loblolly pine forest stands at the Duke
Forest, North Carolina, by comparing the observed and modeled
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
backscatter from
the stands.  Given the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
backscatter data calibration uncertainty, the model made
good predictions (Wang et al. 1995) of C-HH, C-HV, L-HH, L-HV, L-VV, P-HH, and P-HV backscatter
for most of 25 stands studied.  The mode overestimated C-VV backscatter for several
stands, and largely overestimated P-VV backscatter for most of the stands.  Using the collected
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
backscatter and ground data, and the backscatter model, we studied
the influences of changes in biomass on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
backscatter as a function of radar frequency
and polarization, and evaluated the feasibility of deriving the biomass from the
backscatter.  This study showed that C-HH, C-HV, C-VV, L-VV, and P-VV
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
backscatter
may be insensitive to the biomass change.  L-HH, L-HV, P-HH, and P-HV
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
backscatter
changed more than 5 dB as the biomass varied.  This study also showed that the L-HH
and P-HH backscatter or L-HV and P-HV backscatter may be used to develop algorithms
to retrieve trunk biomass or canopy biomass of the Loblolly pine forests.<BR>


<BR>
For young (&lt; 15 years old) Loblolly pine stands at Duke Forest (North Carolina, USA),
when the ground was wet, the observed
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
backscatter from short-grass fields
of 0.05 kg/m<sup>2</sup> biomass was equal to the backscatter from the stands, and there was no significant
correlation between the backscatter and biomass (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.19).  Under dry soil conditions, the backscatter increased about 2 to 3 dB as
the biomass (Wang et al. 1994) increased from 0.05 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to about 0.5-1.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and the backscatter may be saturated near a 0.5-1.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> biomass level.  The correlation coefficient between the backscatter and biomass was
r<sup>2</sup> = 0.46.  When the Santa Barbara microwave canopy backscatter model was applied to
simulate the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
backscatter from the stands over dry ground, modeled and observed
backscatter had similar trends with increasing biomass.  For these stands, sensitivity analyses using the model showed that as the surface-soil moisture increased, the
major contributor to the total backscatter was changed from canopy volume scattering
to surface backscatter between 0.4 and about 1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.  Signal saturating at low standing biomass, and high sensitivity to soil moisture
conditions limits the value of a short-wave (C-band) and steep local incidence angle
(23 deg.) microwave sensor such as the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
for forest monitoring.<BR>


<BR>
Measurements of forest floor surface roughness were made in Duke Forest  Loblolly
pine stands in April 1994 in connection with the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASA">NASA</a> 
Shuttle Imaging Radar (SIR-C)
mission.  A simple, inexpensive, and field-worthy surface roughness gauge (SRG) was
built for this field study.  The problem of how to define the &quot;surface&quot; within the layered
forest floor system was addressed. A practical approach to forest floor roughness
measurement tailored for the modeling of forest floor scattering was proposed.
We estimated rms height and correlation length of the soil surface for 56 transects.  Overall
mean rms height is 2.2 cm and mean correlation length is 29 cm.  Within-stand sampling
variance is large, but stand means are similar.  There is no evidence to indicate
that surface roughness varies as a function of stand age or transect orientation.
The data collected can be used to parameterize forest floor surface scattering models
for Duke Forest and possibly other similar forests.<BR>
<BR>
The Santa Barbara microwave canopy backscattering model was used to investigate the
sensitivity of forest backscatter to soil roughness and moisture.  Surface scattering
was simulated using the empirical model of Oh et al. (1992, 1994, Salita, 1995).
Values for surface roughness and soil moisture parameters were based on the ranges measured
in Duke Forest during
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a>. 
  The simulations indicate the following:
At C-band, co-polarized backscatter was moderately sensitive to surface conditions
at 20-30 degree incidence angles for a young (8 yr.) stand and at 20 degrees for a mid-aged
(25 yr.) stand.  C-HV was moderately sensitive only to the young stand at 20 degrees.
C-band was insensitive to surface conditions at shallower incidence angles and in more mature forests.  L-HH was moderately sensitive in mature stands and strongly
sensitive in young and mid-aged stands in the range of surface conditions simulated.
L-VV had moderate sensitivity only for one mid-aged stand at all incidence angles.
L-HV was insensitive for all stands and angles.  The insensitivity of L-HV to surface
conditions is one likely cause the for relatively strong correlations observed between
L-HV backscatter and biomass.  Initial analyses of the Duke
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data do not demonstrate the response of backscatter to soil moisture predicted by the modeling.  Further
work is needed to isolate the effects of soil moisture from other factors affecting

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
backscatter.<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 

backscatter from two types of forests to analyze and understand scattering mechanisms
in forested environments.  For the Ponderosa pine forest (Mt. Shasta, Calif.), as

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
wavelength increased from C-band to P-band, scattering with an odd number of
reflections decreased, scattering with an even number of reflections increased, and
diffuse scattering showed no clear trend.  For the floodplain swamp forest (Altamaha River,
Georgia), scattering with an odd number of reflections dominated at C-band.  Scattering
with an even number of reflections was strong at L-band and stronger at P-band.
Diffuse scattering from both marsh and swamp forest was &lt;20% of total scattering at C-band
and &lt;15% at L-band and P-band.  This study may be expanded to include
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data
from Duke Forest and Brazil.<BR>
<BR>
Preliminary findings based on Duke Forest
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data analysis<BR>
<BR>
1)
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
backscatter from our site is exponentially distributed as expected for dense
forest canopies that satisfy Rayleigh fading assumptions (Ulaby and Dobson, 1989).
Because the fading statistics are well described, we can place confidence bounds
around forest stand backscatter estimates.  For the Duke Loblolly stands, 90% confidence
intervals are in the range of +/- 0.3 to +/- 0.7 dB, depending on stand size.<BR>
<BR>
2) Sigma-0 of the forest increases as incidence angle decreases. The trend is stronger
than expected from modeling or previous data.  The cause of the trend and whether
or not it is statistically significant have not yet been determined.<BR>
<BR>
3) As anticipated from previous studies, the relationship between backscatter and
stand age (or biomass) is weak.  Only L-HV appears to correlate directly with forest
biomass.  (The indirect biomass retrieval method discussed below may overcome this
apparent limitation.)<BR>
<BR>
4) In most cases, variations in backscatter between different dates (for data takes
having  the same  incidence  angle) are  on the  order of 0-3 dB for individual
stands  and
&lt;2 dB for averages of the stands.  We cannot be sure whether the observed variations
are due to calibration error or to known or unidentified differences in forest conditions.
The variations are of the same magnitude as stand-to-stand sigma-0 differences attributable to biomass.  Within-scene relative calibration is being considered to
remove the systematic variations.<BR>
<BR>
5) With the exception of one rainy morning during
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a>, 
 backscatter was not higher
for wet soil than dry soil conditions, even at small incidence angles.  This apparent
contradiction to model-based expectations is under scrutiny and may lead to better
understanding of sources of forest backscatter uncertainty.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Biomass separability under varying conditions<BR>
<BR>
Our first priority is to investigate the separability of forest stands of differing
structure and biomass under different environmental conditions for a range of incidence
angles.  The main emphasis will be on Duke Loblolly stands, however, Mt. Shasta data will also be evaluated.  Our approach is outlined in the following questions: Under
what conditions (incidence angle, moisture, season) do multiple regressions of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 

backscatter give the strongest predictions for total stand biomass, for crown biomass, for basal area, or for tree height?  For the same conditions, how effective is the
L-HV/C-HV ratio in predicting biomass? This research will extend well into 1996.
Some of the results will be utilized in the indirect biomass retrieval study (below).<BR>
<BR>
Indirect Biomass Retrieval<BR>
<BR>
It has become increasingly clear over the past three years that the direct regression
approach for estimating forest biomass from backscatter is not very powerful, except
in fairly low biomass forests.  The use of cross-polarization ratios, as proposed
by Ranson and Sun (1994), raises the biomass level at which the signal saturates, but
it remains to be seen how applicable the technique will be for diverse forest structural
types of moderate to high biomass.  Dobson et al. (1995) speak to this issue very
plainly.  In that paper the authors observe that much of the data scatter seen in regressions
of backscatter versus biomass is due to variations in forest structure.  For example,
a few large trees may have a total biomass equivalent to that of many small trees but the former produce higher backscatter.<BR>
<BR>
Dobson et al. advocate an indirect method for estimating biomass. In the first step,
regressions against backscatter are developed to predict crown biomass, basal area,
and height of each forest structural class.  Second, estimates of trunk biomass are
derived from basal area and height using allometric equations.  Finally, total biomass
for each class is the sum of crown biomass plus trunk biomass.  Instead of regressions
on the aggregate forest system, the regressions are on individual structural components that are more like what microwaves actually interact with.<BR>
<BR>
We plan to apply Dobson's indirect method to improve biomass estimates in the Duke
Loblolly stands.  Apart from the question of extensibility of this approach to the
Loblolly forest, an equally important question needs to be addressed and will be
investigated in this study: how consistent are results from pass to pass, for varying calibration
and incidence angle, and under changeable forest conditions?  The usefulness of the
indirect biomass retrieval method will depend on whether it is broadly applicable
and repeatable under different
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
and forest conditions.<BR>
<BR>
Texture<BR>
<BR>
A parallel study is planned utilizing texture measures to complement backscatter intensity
in the estimation of biomass. There is much evidence that for many forests structural
evolution accompanies biomass change over time.  This is certainly true in the &quot;old field&quot; Loblolly stands at Duke.  Furthermore, several papers demonstrate improved
discrimination of forest types in
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images when texture is used to augment tone.
Differences in biomass, sensed indirectly through differences in forest structure,
may be estimated more robustly through image texture than is possible using backscatter
alone.  Preliminary work has begun with a literature search and application of texture
algorithms to Mt. Shasta data.  At present, we view this study's primary goal as
generating an independent channel of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
information to feed into biomass estimation
procedures.<BR>

<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
The overall goal of the NASA-sponsored research project is to develop methods to use
spaceborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
imagery to monitor patterns of carbon storage in the pine forests
found in the southeastern United States.  This project is part of an overall program
being carried out by scientists at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERIM">ERIM</a> 
and Duke to develop techniques to use satellite-based
remote sensors to monitor carbon flux in this region.  Towards this end, funding
has also been secured from the Environmental Protection Agency to pursue research
beyond the scope of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
project.  Specifically,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#EPA">EPA</a> 
funding is being used to obtain
and analyze Landsat
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TM">TM</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#MSS">MSS</a> 
imagery over the test site to monitor changes in forest
cover in this region from 1975 to present, to develop models describing patterns
of below-ground carbon storage, and to develop an integrated approach using information
derived from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and Landsat with ground-based models to study landscape scale
patterns of carbon storage and flux.<BR>
<BR>
Specific objectives of the overall program are to:<BR>
<BR>
Develop optimum algorithms to estimate aboveground biomass/carbon in pine forests
of the southeast U.S. using multichannel, spaceborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data (NASA funded).<BR>
<BR>
Develop models which link aboveground biomass/carbon with ground-layer carbon in pine
forests in the southeast U.S. (EPA funded).<BR>
<BR>
Based on (1) and (2) above, estimate patterns of carbon storage in the pine forests
surrounding  Durham, North Carolina at the times of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
overflights<BR>
(NASA funded).<BR>
<BR>
Evaluate the utility of using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a>

and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#MSS">MSS</a> 
data (EPA funded).<BR>
<BR>
Develop methods to combine the information derived from Landsat and

<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Prior to March of 1994, our activities focused on investigations of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 


   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data to develop approaches in using radar imagery to monitor changes in biomass
in southern U.S. pines.  Towards this goal, a set of 80 test sites were established
in the Duke Forest.  These test sites were measured and techniques developed to estimate
patterns of biomass present in these forests based on in situ measurements as well
as allometric equations available in the literature.  The utility of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data to
monitor biomass patterns was clearly established during these initial experiments.  These
data were also used in theoretical modeling studies to better understand the relationships
between
   <a href="Acronyms.html#EM">EM</a> 
scattering and tree characteristics. This research resulted in eight published journal articles (see reference list).<BR>
<BR>
The activities pursued during the past eighteen months were first focused on collection
of ground-truth data sets to support the analysis of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data.  These ground
truth data included measurement of stand characteristics for 60 different pine stands, collection of  soil moisture measurements during the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
overflights in April
and October of 1994, collection of local meteorologic conditions during the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 

overflights, and collection of canopy hemispherical photographs.  The support of
two
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
overflights within a seven-month period stretched the financial resources available
at Duke University to the fullest, and required expending funds not received until
November of 1994.  Thus, we were not able to begin to fully reduce the ground data
until the spring of 1995, when additional funding was received.  In addition to supporting
the experiments themselves, the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PI">PI</a> 
for this experiment (E. Kasischke) also served
as Co-Chairman of the Ecology Discipline Panel for the National Research Council's
review of the utility of Spaceborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
for earth science applications.  This activity
required considerable efforts from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PI">PI</a> 
during the time period from November 1994
through February 1995, and severely strained the funding resources available for
analysis of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data until a further funding increment was received in March of 1995.<BR>
<BR>
Since March of 1995, we have begun to seriously analyze the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data sets.
Our activities during this time period have focused on reducing the ground-truth
data and on extracting signatures from the radar data sets.  The data are currently
being used in two separate analyses, each of which should result in a journal article.  The
first analyses is being conducted jointly with Frank Davis (UCSB) and Yong Wang (ECU).
This is a modeling study on the sensitivity of radar backscatter to variations in
surface moisture and changes in incidence angle.  The second analyses is exploring
the effects variations in imaging geometry and seasonal variations (e.g., leaf on
versus leaf off, soil moisture) on the ability of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
to estimate aboveground biomass.
The approach being used is through a multistage approach, where canopy biomass is estimated
from radar imagery, which in turn is used to estimate total stand.  These journal
articles are currently in preparation and should be submitted by the end of the year.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PLANNED ACTIVITIES -
   <a href="Acronyms.html#FY">FY</a> 
'96/'97<BR>
<BR>
In addition to submitting the two journal articles mentioned above, during FY96/97
we plan the following activities (each of which will result in a separate journal
article):<BR>
<BR>
1. Analysis of Different Approaches to Estimation of Aboveground Biomass Using SIR-C/X-
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 

Data<BR>
<BR>
Several different methodologies have been proposed to estimate aboveground biomass
in forests.  In addition to the two-step approach developed by this program, Jon
Ranson uses a polarization ratio to estimate biomass, while Craig Dobson uses a multiple-step approach where longer wavelength
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data are used to estimate tree height and basal
area and shorter wavelength data are used to estimate canopy biomass.  Under this
study, we will compare all three approaches to determine which approach is best suited
for the forest conditions found in the southeast U.S.<BR>
<BR>
2. Regional Estimates on Patterns of Carbon Storage in a Southeast U.S. Pine Forest
Complex using Spaceborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
Data<BR>
<BR>
This study will take the results from the algorithm from the previous analyses and
use them to estimate patterns of biomass present in the pine forests in the Duke
Forest Region.  This analysis will also utilize the below-ground carbon models developed
by the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#EPA">EPA</a> 
study to develop a total carbon budget for these forests.<BR>
<BR>
3. Analysis of the Effects of Imaging and Scene Parameters for Detection of Floodingin
a Bald  Cypress Forest Wetland<BR>
<BR>
Duke Forest contains a test stand of Bald Cypress which was continuously flooded during
the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
overflights.  In the April flight, the leaves on the trees of this stand
had just begun to flush, while during the October flight, the leaves were fully flushed.  This study will focus on determining how well the different wavelength/polarizations
of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
detected this flooded forest wetland as a function of incidence
angle and leaf on/off conditions.  The study will employ both empirical analyses
as well as theoretical scattering models.<BR>
<BR>
4. Mapping Forest Cover using Combined Landsat
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TM">TM</a>

<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>

The work during this period has been focused on the use of spaceborne polarimetric
radar measurements for monitoring, mapping, and retrieving the above ground vegetation
biomass.  Fully polarimetric radar data obtained from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
missions in
April and October 1994 over the Landes Forest in Southwestern France have been analyzed
in detail.  The Landes forest is the largest plantation forest in France, and covers
nearly one million hectares of flat topography.  This forest is almost totally formed
by maritime pine (pinus pinaster), and it has been managed in such a way that the forest
is divided into various areas of large and statistically homogeneous tree stands
of the same age.  The acquired
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data has been compared with the previous
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 

campaign (L- and C-band, fully polarimetric, 40-50 degree incidence angle),
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
data
(C-band,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VV">VV</a>, 
 23 degree incidence angle), and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JERS-1">JERS-1</a> 
data (L-band,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a>, 
 35 degree incidence
angle) to assure the consistency of measurement.<BR>
<BR>


In the investigation of the application of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data to 
vegetated terrain classification
and biomass inversion, the measured backscattering coefficients
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup><sub>hh,</sub>
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup><sub>vv,</sub>
and
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup><sub>hv,</sub>), 
the derived complex correlation coefficient 
(<img src="/symbols/rho.gif" alt="[rho]">) 
of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VV">VV</a> 
polarizations as well as the ratio
 between cross- and co-polarization
ratio 
(<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup><sub>hv</sub>
/ 
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup><sub>vv</sub>) 
are fully utilized.
  A validated pine forest scattering model, which is based
on the radiative transfer theory with 
the specific branching structure of pine tree
taken into account, is used to interpret the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
polarimetric backscattering
measurements from the Landes forest.  From the analysis of measured data and the theoretical
simulation, the cross-polarization backscattering coefficients at L-band and the
correlation between
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VV">VV</a> 
backscattering returns at both L- and C-band are found
to be most useful for the biomass retrieval.  Bayesian classifications using data
with known ground truth and with theoretical simulation are applied to classify the
forest for biomass up to 50 tons per hectare with the available data at this time
(26 degree incidence angle).  With the use of pine forest scattering model, biomass inversion
has been shown to be feasible over a wider biomass range (up to 100 tons per hectare)
for angles of incidence around 45 degrees.  In addition to the analysis of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data, we have refined our forest scattering model by taking into account the double
scattering mechanism between trunk and branches which shows more effects on the cross-polarized
backscattering return.  We have also studied the collective scattering and absorption effects of clustered objects like the branches and leaves in a vegetation
canopy.  A new approach for studying the polarimetric response of various types of
forest is also developed by using the L-systems technique to generate different kinds
of plants.<BR>
<BR>
In this work, we have collaborated closely with Dr. Le Toan's research group at the
Center d'Etudes Spatiale De La Biosphere (CESBIO) of France.  During the different
flights of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
over the test site, extensive ground truth data had been collected by Dr. Le Toan's team.  These consist of an updated biomass map which provides the
location and ages of more than 50 stands of maritime pines, as well as the statistical
information about the densities and sizes of trees and branches.  In addition, a
clear-cut map is also available with some ground truth measurements including soil moisture
and surface profiles.  These valuable descriptions provide the key input parameters
for our theoretical pine forest scattering model.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>


<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
The fully polarimetric backscattering measurements over the Landes forest from the
first
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
flight was taken at a 26 degree incidence angle.  In Figures 1 and 2,
we compare the backscattering coefficients and the correlation coefficients between
the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
measured and model predicted data for both forest stands and clear-cuts at L- and
C-band frequencies.  The comparison between experiment and theory shows good agreement.
The clear-cuts are areas where the biomass is lower than 5 tons/ha.  For the area
with bare soil surface, the magnitude of the correlation coefficient is close to 1
either at L- or C- band.  When the area with forest stands is considered, the magnitude
of rho drops to a value of 0.35 for older stands.<BR>
<BR>


During the second
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
flight, measurements with different incident angles (18 and
51 degrees) were obtained.  We then performed theoretical simulations to examine
the scattering mechanisms involved in the angular variations with backscatter from
forest.  It is found that at a higher incident angle 
(51&#176;), where the scattering from tree
crown dominates for both L- and C-band, the cross-polarized return at L-band has
larger dynamic range than lower incident angles.  For small incident angles, the
copolarized return from ground is more important for forest stands with low biomass.  This suggests
that the results may differ with surface conditions.<BR>
<BR>
Classification and Biomass Estimation of the Landes Forest<BR>
<BR>
With the ground truth from biomass map, the supervised classification of forest stands
between 0 tons/ha and 50 tons/ha has been performed with a set of multi-look (5 x
5), fully polarimetric data at 26 degrees. The data are divided into 5 classes: from
0 to 7 tons/ha, from 8 to 20 tons/ha, from 21 to 33 tons/ha, from 34 to 50 tons/ha,
and the one with more than 50 tons/ha.  Using Bayes classification algorithm, an
accuracy of 86% has been achieved.  The accuracy of classification with backscattering
coefficients only is 62%.  Unsupervised classification of forest stands using theoretical
models gives an accuracy of 70%.  It is also found that for the classification of
bare soil with forest areas, the ratio 
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup><sub>hv</sub>
/
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup><sub>vv</sub>
and the magnitude of 
<img src="/symbols/rho.gif" alt="[rho]">
yield the best results.  For both L and C-band frequencies, the forest can be classified
with ratio higher than -11 dB or the magnitude of 
<img src="/symbols/rho.gif" alt="[rho]">
lower than 0.85.  As for the biomass retrieval, the magnitude of 
<img src="/symbols/rho.gif" alt="[rho]">
gives the best performance.<BR>
<BR>


Collective Scattering and Absorption Effects<BR>
<BR>
For a locally clustered medium, the scatterers are clumped together like branches
and leaves in a vegetation canopy.  In such cases, the scatterers will scatter collectively.
Collective scattering effects include correlated scattering, which takes into account the relative phase of scattered waves from the scatterers and their neighbors.
The mutual coherent wave interactions between scatterers are also included.  The
locally clustering structure has important effects in determining the cluster's electromagnetic properties.  We have shown that, in locally clustered media, the absorption
of the cluster can be several times greater than the incoherent sum of the absorption
of its components.  This suggests that in random media problems the effects of the
clustered geometry on both scattering and absorption must be considered.<BR>
<BR>
Theoretical Modeling of Forest Using L-Systems<BR>
<BR>
The Monte Carlo approach has also been applied to study the scattering of electromagnetic
waves by plants that are grown using the L-systems technique.  The position, size,
and orientation of every element in a generated tree can be obtained from the computer simulation.  The scattering fields from all tree elements are added coherently
to calculate the total scattering field.  The results are further averaged over many
tree realizations.  Simulations of different types of trees show that the polarimetric
backscattering behavior of forest is affected by the inner structure of plants.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
The overall objective of this study is to investigate the application of spaceborne
polarimetric data for classifying, mapping, and parameter retrieval of vegetated
terrain using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
polarimetric data.  Based on our research goals, the planned
investigations include:<BR>
<BR>
Classification of Various Types of Forests<BR>
<BR>
We will investigate the capabilities of radar data to achieve the classification of
forests in a worldwide scale into major types according to the tree architectural
forms.  For each type of forest, the corresponding
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
images will be requested,
and the backscattering coefficients will be evaluated.  We will also investigate the
relationships between polarimetric discriminations and tree structures and species.
In addition to the Landes pine forest, the forest of eucalyptus in Congo, and the
rain forest in Amazon will be studied.  For different types of trees, the corresponding
tree architecture model and the backscattering model will be set up with the use
of L-systems technique.<BR>
<BR>
Monitoring Rice Growth<BR>
<BR>
In this study, the identification of rice fields at various growth stages, as well
as the classification into different species will be investigated.  At present, a
theoretical scattering model for rice field at different growth stages has been developed
at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#MIT">MIT</a>, 
 it will be applied to interpret the radar measurements.  The test sites will
be some rice fields at Indonesia and Japan.  These sites have been the subject of
remote sensing project using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
data to monitor rice growth. 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
data will
also provide us with samples of measurement at various rice growth stages for comparison.<BR>
<BR>
Soil Moisture and Roughness Inversion<BR>
<BR>
In order to assess the inversion of soil moisture from polarimetric data, a forward
rough surface scattering model has been developed at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#MIT">MIT</a>. 
  This model is using the
Monte Carlo approach which solves a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#3-D">3-D</a> 
random rough surface scattering problem numerically.  A neural network is trained based on the direct scattering model and will be
subsequently used to invert the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data.  The selected sites with supporting
ground truth are the Landes forest in France and Matera in Italy.<BR>

Relating Radar Backscatter Responses to Woody and Foliar Biomass of Pine Forests<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Demonstrate the use of spaceborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images to detect forest parameters (biomass
of different parts of the canopy).<BR>
<BR>
Increase the understanding of the interaction between microwaves and vegetation canopies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Forest studies<BR>
<BR>
The overall objective of forest studies developed in the frame of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data
analysis has been to assess the capability of multi-incidence polarimetric data for
the inversion of forest biomass, and for the monitoring of deforestation.
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

data acquired over Les Landes Forest test site in France have been compared with a theoretical
modeling using a four layer radiative transfer model [Hsu et al. 1994].<BR>
<BR>


The model has been subsequently used to determine the major contributions of the tree
backscattering mechanisms, but also to define the optimal configurations (incidence,
frequency, polarization) accordingly to the objectives (estimation of crown biomass,
woody biomass,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#LAI">LAI</a>, 
...).<BR>
<BR>


Amzong the intensity information (i.e. backscattering coefficients 
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup><sub>hh,</sub>
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup><sub>vv,</sub>
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup><sub>hv</sub>), 
L-band
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HV">HV</a> 
backscattering at 51 has been found to offer the highest sensitivity
to biomass content on the range [0 tons/ha, 150 tons/ha].<BR>
<BR>
Regarding the polarimetric information of the measurement, C-band degree of coherence
between
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VV">VV</a> 
signals at low incidence angle (26.4) provided the best results
for forest/non forest segmentation. Based on the C-band coherence, the unsupervised
extraction of regenerating forest has been achieved with an accuracy higher than 85%,
while the discrimination between forest and nonforest areas has indicated an accuracy
of 87%. Maps of coherence have been therefore derived, and compared with the corresponding color composite intensity images. Refined details of the area, as well as forest/nonforest
segmentation have been shown to be emphasized on the coherence maps, showing complementarity
between polarimetric and intensity information for forest segmentation and for forest parameters retrieval.<BR>
<BR>
Retrieval of soil moisture from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data<BR>
<BR>
The main objective of soil moisture studies based on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data analysis has
been to investigate the effect of surface roughness and soil moisture on polarimetric

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
with the aim of inverting
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data either into roughness states, or into soil
moisture with a reduced effect of surface roughness.<BR>
<BR>
For this,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data acquired during the first and second missions over bare
fields located at the Landes (France) and Matera (Italy) test areas have been analyzed.
In addition, the dependence of the copolarized correlation coefficient on the roughness state has been also addressed.  In order to investigate the effect of polarization,
the correlation coefficient has been derived for any pp-qq polarization states, where
(p,q) is a basis of orthogonal polarizations. The results have indicated that the
sensitivity of the correlation coefficient to the roughness state is enhanced at the
circular polarization compared to the HH-VV polarization.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Forest<BR>
<BR>
The technique developed over Les Landes test site for biomass inversion and deforestation
studies will be assessed for other types of forest canopies. A study has been initiated
over a tropical forest area in Brazil. The site of Sena Madureira, where extensive deforestation activities are in progress,<BR>
will be of particular interest. The preliminary results show an obvious complement
between intensity and coherence images, but require further ground truth informations
to be fully understood. In addition, polarization synthesis techniques will be assessed for the improvement of<BR>
biomass monitoring.<BR>
<BR>
Soil moisture studies<BR>
<BR>
The preliminary results have shown that the sensitivity of the correlation coefficient
to the roughness state is enhanced when expressed in a circular polarization basis,
compared to a linear basis. Polarization synthesis techniques are expected to be
useful for filtering roughness effects in the backscattering from rough surfaces.<BR>
<BR>
A topic for further studies will be to derive maps of soil roughness based on the
degree of coherence expressed in a linear polarization's basis, and subsequently
to assess the moisture inversion problem, provided that full polarimetric data are
available.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, within the frame of an IGPB project,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SALT">SALT</a> 
(Savanas in the Long Term)
project, transitions between forest and desert in West Africa have been studied.
These areas are expected to present similar moisture content from one year to the
other, for a given period of the year. One particularity of these transition zones is the existence
of inhomogeneous areas, composed of soils and scattered trees of very low density.
These transition zones represent an opportunity to study radar responses of different transitional regions, from sub tropical forest to desert.
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data requested
will concern a Sahel transect. The research topics related to these subjects will
deal will responses of different surface types (i.e. roughness mapping), as well
as the modelling of mixed radar pixels.<BR>
<BR>
Rice<BR>
<BR>
A topic for future studies is the mapping of rice fields in different parts of the
world, the classification of rice fields at various stages of growth.<BR>
<BR>
In the past few years, investigations have been carried out using X-band airborne
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in France [Le Toan et al., 1989].  The results showed
an increase of the radar backscatter with days after transplantation until a plateau
approximately at heading stage. This increase coincides with the increase of biomass and
has been explained by the dominant vegetation-water interaction scattering mechanism.
Recent studies lead in Japan [Kurosu et al., 1995] and in Indonesia [Le Toan et al.,
1995] confirmed this temporal behavior of the radar backscatter.<BR>
<BR>
A theoretical model of scattering from rice plants at different growth stages [Le
Toan et al., 1995] has been developed. The result shows that the specific structure
of rice fields (vertical sticks distributed on a flooded surface) produces a backscattered response critically dependent of the polarization state. Hence, the use of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

to identify rice fields appears promising.<BR>
<BR>
The aim of the future study will be to study the polarimetric/multifrequency behavior
of rice fields, in order to derive robust methods of rice monitoring.<BR>
<BR>
The investigations will be performed on multitemporal and multipolarization X and
C band
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images over test sites where rice fields maps are available, including
the following steps :<BR>
<BR>

<ul>
<li>the retrieval of radar backscatter values from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images,<BR>
<BR>
<li>the analysis of the polarization and temporal responses of the vegetation cover
to highlight the  particular behavior of flooded rice fields and to determine the
information carried by  multipolarization,<BR>
<BR>
<li>the interpretation of the observations of rice fields by

Determining The Extent Of Inundation On Tropical And Subtropical Floodplains Beneath
Vegetation Of Varying Types And Densities<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Develop a procedure for recovering the presence, absence, and patchy presence of water
and its spatial distribution beneath different floodplain plant communities of varying
crown closures, densities, stand geometries, and canopy states for sites in Georgia.  Test the applicability of the procedure to the Amazon and Alligator river floodplains
in Brazil and Australia.<BR>
<BR>
Modify, extend, and verify the Santa Barbara radar model for different floodplain
vegetation types and densities.<BR>
<BR>
Test both discrimination procedures and model predictions for leaf-on/leaf-off and
water-on/water-off states against
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
and aircraft radar images.<BR>
<BR>
Couple the above modeling and discrimination procedures for floodwater detection and
delineation for input to conceptual flood stage/flood area hydrologic models.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
During Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) mission 1 (April 1994), and SRL mission 2 (October
1994), field teams were deployed to the Manaus Supersite in Brazil, the Pantanal
Backup site in Brazil and a secondary site near Darwin, Australia.  Classified images
of the central Amazon within the Manaus supersite were produced within two days of image
acquisition during SRL 1 and 2.  These images were used widely by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TV">TV</a> 
and newspaper
coverage of the missions.  In December 1994, a manuscript derived from these images
and associated field measurements was submitted to the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IEEE">IEEE</a> 
Transactions on Geoscience
and Remote Sensing; it appeared in the July 1995 issue.  Subsequently, analysis has
continued on other
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
scenes from the central Amazon, Pantanal and northern Australia.  A summary of scenes processed, publications, presentations and planned publications
is shown in Table 1.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Our research has focused on developing techniques for using synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) data to decipher hydrologic and vegetative conditions on floodplains.  Knowledge
of the seasonal dynamics of inundation and vegetation is the basis for understanding biogeochemical processes such as methane generation and for managing resources such
as fisheries and other wildlife.  Such information is lacking for most floodplains,
particularly in the tropics.<BR>
<BR>
In order to realize the potential for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
to delineate floodplain inundation and vegetation,
robust classification methods are needed which do not require repeated optimization
by scene or date.  We have therefore employed a rules-based approach, using a decision-tree model to construct classification rules.  Decision tree classifiers are
hierarchical multistage classifiers that can use different predictor variables at
different stages of the decision process.  The decision-tree classification approach
was developed and tested using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data obtained for the Altamaha River, Georgia.
A scene including floodplain and upland was classified using the full set of 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 

variables  
   (<a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a>,

   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a>, 


   <a href="Acronyms.html#JERS-1">JERS-1</a>, 
 and Radarsat datasets. Using the full
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
inputs, error rates
(percent of training pixels misclassified) were less than 5%.  In both cases, the
decision tree model selected both long and short wavelengths (C and P or C and L) and both

   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HV">HV</a> 
polarizations.  Error rates were higher using the JERS input (L-HH only);
the overall error rate was 11%.  Classifications using either
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
(C-VV) or Radarsat
(C-HH) configurations had error rates over 35%.  High accuracies could be achieved by
combining single-wavelength sensors; the overall error rate with a C-HH plus L-HH
combination was only 5%.<BR>
<BR>
The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
missions offered the opportunity to test the ability of multi-frequency

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
to accurately delineate tropical floodplain inundation and vegetation from space.
Because
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data for our main study area were downlinked and processed during
the missions, we were able to test whether such analyses could be completed very rapidly,
as would be required for applications such as disaster assessment.  We also tested
whether decision rules based on a combined (two-date) training set would be significantly less accurate than rules tailored to the individual dates.<BR>
<BR>
During Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) mission 1 (April 1994) and SRL mission 2 (October
1994), field teams were deployed to the Manaus Supersite in Brazil, the Pantanal
Backup site in Brazil and a secondary site near Darwin Australia.  A field team was
also in Brazil during August 1994 in anticipation of the aborted launch of SRL 2.  Field
measurements in Brazil included ground and boat surveys and over-flights in light
aircraft.  Ground measurements of vegetation and hydrology included estimates of
stem density, plant height above the water, phenology, dielectric constants, canopy closure
and water depth.  Corner reflectors were deployed to aid calibration of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data.
Helicopter over-flights were conducted during the missions in Australia.  In late
March 1995, Melack revisited the study area and made ground observations and additional
over-flights.  During
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
transects over our Altamaha site in Georgia, USA, flown
in October 1994, boat and aerial surveys were done. 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data were acquired during
both Space Radar Lab flights, and &quot;realtime&quot; data were received at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ICESS">ICESS</a> 
during the
missions for the Barroso study area, spanning the floodplains of the Negro and Solimoes
(Amazon) rivers about 50 km west of their confluence near the city of Manaus, Brazil.
Classified images were produced and tested within two days of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data acquisition.
In December 1994 , a manuscript derived from these images and associated field measurements
was submitted to the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IEEE">IEEE</a> 
Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing; it appeared in the July 1995 issue (Hess et al. 1995, see Table 1).  Both C-band and
L-band were necessary to distinguish the landcover types. 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a> 
polarization was most
useful for distinguishing flooded from non-flooded vegetation (C-HH for macrophyte
vs. pasture, and L-HH for flooded vs. non-flooded forest), and cross-polarized L-band data
provided the best separation between woody and non-woody vegetation. Between the
April and October missions, the Amazon River level fell about 3.6 m and the portion
of the study area covered by flooded forest decreased from 23% to 12%.  Using decision rules
derived from the individual scenes, misclassification rates of test pixels were 3%
for April and 4% for October. Using rules based on the combined April and October
datasets, the misclassification rate for the combined test pixels was 5%.  This is a positive
indication that it will be feasible to build multidate knowledge on which to base
decision rules.<BR>
<BR>
During SRL 1 and 2 we were engaged in public relations activities.  Our classified
images of the Amazon floodplain were featured repeatedly by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#CNN">CNN</a> 
News.  Melack gave
interviews televised on Santa Barbara's
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TV">TV</a> 
station
   <a href="Acronyms.html#KEYT">KEYT</a>, 
 and our research was reported
in a full page article in Santa Barbara's News Press. 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#UCSB">UCSB</a> 
highlighted our
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
research
in its alumni magazine, Coastlines, and its newspaper to faculty and staff, 93106.
Some analysis has been conducted for two other wetland
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
sites: the Pantanal
(Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil), and the Alligator River (Northern Territories, Australia)
(Hess and Melack 1995).  Both sites offer conditions not found in the Amazon or Altamaha
sites. The Pantanal landscape is dominated by grasses rather than trees.  Some of
the aquatic macrophyte communities found at the Alligator River site are quite different
structurally from those at the Brazilian or Altamaha sites.  For both the Pantanal
and Alligator River, we will integrate X-SAR and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data, which should improve
discrimination of macrophyte communities.<BR>
<BR>
In order to better understand the scattering mechanisms operating in flooded and nonflooded
forests, and to predict the effect of changes in forest structure variables on backscattering
at different wavelengths and polarizations, we simulated C-, L-, and P-band backscatter from a tropical flooded forest using the Santa Barbara microwave
canopy backscatter model (Wang et al. 1995).  Extensive forest stand data collected
at the Anavilhanas flooded forest, a large fluvial archipelago in the lower Negro
River near Manaus, were supplemented with published values for similar forest types.  Given
the same wavelength or incidence angle, the ratio of backscatter from the flooded
forest to that from the nonflooded forest was higher at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a> 
polarization than at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VV">VV</a> 

polarization.  Given the same wavelength or polarization, the ratio was larger at small
incidence angles than at large incidence angles. Given the same polarization or incidence
angle, the ratio was larger at a long wavelength than at a short wavelength.  As
the surface soil moisture underneath the nonflooded forest increased from 10 to 50% of
volumetric moisture, the flooded/nonflooded backscatter ratio decreased; the decreases
were small at C- and L-band but large at P-band.  When the leaf size was comparable
to or larger than the wavelength of C-band, the leaf area index (LAI) had a large effect
on the simulated C-band (not L-band or P-band) backscatter from the flooded and nonflooded
forests.<BR>
<BR>
The Anavilhanas forest is taller and about as dense as other Amazonian closed-canopy
varzea forests and igapo forests on clay soils; it is significantly taller and denser
than most igapo forests on sandy soils or open-canopy varzea stands.  Compared to
published values for cypress-tupelo and bottomland hardwood stands of the southeastern
U.S., and to seasonally flooded Melaleuca woodlands of Australia, the Anavilhanas
forest is denser and has higher
   <a href="Acronyms.html#LAI">LAI</a> 
and branch biomass. The results from the Anavilhanas
modeling thus roughly bound the high end (i.e. maximum canopy attenuation) of the spectrum
of several major subtropical and tropical floodplain forest structures.  We therefore
expect a flooded/nonflooded ratio of at least 2 to 3 dB at small incidence angles for the majority of floodplain forests (which would have lower canopy attenuation
than the Anavilhanas stand), at CHH, LHH and PHH.  At CVV, we would expect much less
contrast between flooded and nonflooded unless the canopy was rather open.<BR>
<BR>
Melack played a key role in preparing for the review of NASA's
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
program by the
National Academy of Science's Committee on Earth Sciences.  He chaired and hosted
the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
Ecology workshop, co-edited the Ecology chapter in the report to the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NAS">NAS</a> 

(Kasischke and Melack 1995) and co-presented the perspectives of the ecological community to
the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NAS">NAS</a> 
committee.<BR>
<BR>
The research activities at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#UCSB">UCSB</a> 
have a major educational component.  The primary team
is composed of three graduate students (L. Hess, S. Filoso and D. Valeriano) and
one post-doctoral researcher (Y. Wang), who is now an Assistant Professor.  Weekly
meetings concerned with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
science and applications also have included other students and
faculty, and an increasing number of visitors from abroad or the USA.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Our research on inundation and ecology of floodplains during the next two years will
include (1) further analysis of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
scenes and (2) synergistic use of multisensor
data.  We estimate that these activities will require about 40 additional
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
scenes.<BR>
<BR>
Further analysis of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
and related data:  During the next six months we will
focus our analyses on two datasets:
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
April and October scenes of the Cabaliana
reach of the Amazon floodplain and neighboring upland scenes, and 1990, 1991, and 1994 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
datasets for the Altamaha River.  We have conducted extensive field
documentation in both areas.<BR>
<BR>
Results from the Cabaliana analysis will be used to refine and extend our classification
of aquatic vegetation and will be combined with our Landsat and passive microwave
work (see below) to improve regional estimates of methane emission.  Our examination
of upland forests will evaluate the possibility of retrieving information about tropical
forest strucure from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data.  Our measurements of upland forest structure include
stem density, basal area, stand height and canopy closure as measured by hemispherical images taken with videography.  The study areas have large tracts of primary
forest and stands of secondary forest at different stages of regeneration.  Several
band-polarization combinations will be analyzed for development of algorithms to
acquire information on stand structure from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data.  Similar analysis has been completed
using C band data collected during the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAREX">SAREX</a> 
mission for a study site near the Tucurui
dam in the eastern Amazon.<BR>
<BR>
The Altamaha site has an unusually large range of floodplain forest stand densities,
and multiple
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
swaths were obtained over a wide range of incidence angles.
These data are therefore being used to document how incidence angle effects on backscattering vary with forest stand type.  These results will help in determining guidelines
on appropriate incidence angle ranges to use at given wavelength/polarization combinations
for wetlands monitoring.<BR>
<BR>
The next step in our
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
analysis will be to use the Amazon, Pantanal, Alligator
River, and Altamaha datasets to determine the degree to which our classification
algorithms are applicable to widely varying types of wetlands, as a step towards
a global wetlands mapping strategy. The decision-tree model we are using is well suited
to this problem because it is easily updated and can include categorical data such
as date, soil or general wetland type.  Analysis of the multisite, multidate
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
dataset will allow us to estimate realistically the accuracy achievable
and recommend appropriate strategies for wetlands mapping initiatives.  For example,
Melack is chairing an IGBP workshop designed to develop a strategy for producing
a global inventory of inundation and wetland vegetation to be used in conjunction with hydrological,
ecological and biogeochemical projects within IGBP and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#MTPE">MTPE</a>. 
<BR>
<BR>
Synergistic use of multisensor data:  Inundation of a floodplain is the product of
the hydrology of different water types that enter the floodplain.  The spatial and
temporal patterns are in turn influenced by the topography, soils and vegetation
of the floodplain.  As a result of such complexity, ecological consequences of inundation and
hazards associated with floods vary from river to river and season to season.  Our
strategy for investigating the processes influencing water, sediment, and nutrient
transport to and from floodplains is to insure, through a combination of field, numerical
simulation, and remote sensing techniques, that we have hydrologic, geomorphic and
vegetation data at sufficient temporal and spatial resolutions to determine the significant processes influencing the pattern of flooding.  From a remote sensing perspective,
we can determine the following critical elements: (1) the relationship between inundation
and water stage for predictive models, (2) the general pattern of vegetative cover, (3) the degree of incursion of different water types, and (4) the seasonal boundaries
of inundation.  The first element requires fine temporal resolution, as provided
by passive microwave sensors. The second and third elements require optical (visible and infrared) and active microwave data at sufficiently fine spatial resolution that
flood characteristics can be described as the pattern changes. The boundary of inundation
or saturation (element 4) can be mapped using multiband
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data.<BR>
<BR>
To accomplish these ambitious objectives we have initiated several activities:  We
have successfully proposed to become ERS-SAR and Radarsat investigators; hence, we
will receive ample C-band data for our study sites in Georgia and Brazil, albeit
without funding for data analysis.  We are participating in a collaboration with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>, 
 the Japanese
space agency (NASDA), the Brazilian space agency (INPE) and the Brazilian Institute
for Amazonian Research (INPA) to acquire and interpret JERS-SAR (L-band) data for
the Amazon.  Furthermore, deployment of corner reflectors and collection of secondary
forest biometric measurements and canopy closure videography were conducted near
Manaus in September 1994 for the acquisition of calibrated
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JERS-1">JERS-1</a> 
data under an agreement between
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASDA">NASDA</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#INPE">INPE</a> 
and the Brazilian State Oil Company (Petrobras).  Calibrated
data for this overpass as well as for an overpass at about the same time as the April

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
mission have been provided by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASDA">NASDA</a> 
and data analysis is in progress.  With
on-going support from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASA">NASA</a>, 
 we are continuing our application of passive microwave data
(SMMR and SSMI) to determine seasonal inundation in the major floodplains of South
America.  In association with an
   <a href="Acronyms.html#EOS">EOS</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#IDS">IDS</a> 
investigation (Soares of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#INPE">INPE</a> 
and Dunne
of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#UCSB">UCSB</a> 
and Univ. of Washington), we are using Landsat imagery, in part derived from the Humid
Tropics Pathfinder, to classify vegetation along the Amazon floodplain.<BR>
<BR>
Our synergistic use of multisensor data is benefitting from the active participation
of Dr. Leal Mertes, Dept. of Geography and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ICESS">ICESS</a>. 
  She has applied spectral mixture
analysis of Landsat data to detection of sediment distributions and floodplain habitats and has developed numerical simulation models of flooding.  As her interests in
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 

have increased, she has joined J. Melack as a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#Co-I">Co-I</a> 
on our ERS and Radarsat projects.
Furthermore, Mertes and Melack have a proposal pending with Hydrological Processes
at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NSF">NSF</a> 
to fund additional examination of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data and to combine those results with
on-going hydrological, geomorphological, ecological and biogeochemical studies.
Additional collaboration is beginning with Dr. Geoff Henebry (Univ. of Kansas) in
the analysis of texture in
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
and Radarsat scenes from the Pantanal, and with Dr. Max
Finlayson (ERISS, Australia) in interpretation and application of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
imagery in
northern Australia.<BR>

<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Study the impact of tropical forest fragmentation on local populations of endangered
and threatened species of certain mammals, butterflies, birds and plants.  Vegetation
information from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data over three tropical-forest intensive-study sites
will aid an independent, broader study of forest fragmentation and its effects on biodiversity.<BR>
<BR>
Add the unique, detailed information on forest fragmentation from spacecraft-based

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
to the broader study begun ins 1988.<BR>
<BR>
Use imaging data from the Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and the National Oceanographic
and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) to
assess on a biome scale, but with less spatial resolution than that of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data.<BR>
<BR>
Evaluate the use of the unique information about forest distributions and stand conditions
expected from multiparameter synthetic aperture radar (SAR) relative to that from
the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#MSS">MSS</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AVHRR">AVHRR</a>. 
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Most of the effort has focused on preprocessing issues. 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#CSUF">CSUF</a> 
staff developed and
used an adapted version of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#CEOS">CEOS</a> 
reader software package to enable the translation
of original 6-10 byte
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data or the 4 byte X-SAR data to raster formats compatible
with off-the-shelf image processing software packages like the Map and Image Processing
System (called
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TNTmips">TNTmips</a>) 
 from MicroImages, Inc. 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TNTmips">TNTmips</a> 
is used by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#CSUF">CSUF</a> 
and by GeoEcoArc
(Dr. K. Pope). 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TNTmips">TNTmips</a> 
is also at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#UC">UC</a> 
Davis.  The basic departure in our approach to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data preprocessing is to produce 16-bit integer rasters (rather than
8-bit integer) rasters from the compressed data produced by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
or
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DLR">DLR</a>. 
  In addition,
CSUF-derived indices (combinations of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data) are produced such as the Volume
Scattering Index (VSI), the Canopy Structure Index (CSI), and the Interaction Type Index
(ITI) (see Pope et al., 1994).<BR>
<BR>
Another area of great attention during the last year has been the processing of ground
truth data for the Manaus site.  These consist of video tapes by Dr. Taylor, her
sketch maps, her notes, and scans of maps for the region (1:50,000 scale and 1:250,000
scale).  Relatively large-scale maps for the Manaus study site are rare.<BR>
<BR>
Yet another processing issue of interest to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#CSUF">CSUF</a> 
is the question of the generation
of textural information (by aggregate spatial analysis algorithms) from single-look
complex (SIR-C
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SLC">SLC</a> 
or X-SAR
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SSC">SSC</a>) 
 data.  Dr. R. Smith has been exploring this issue
in depth.  Our focus is on ways and means for the aggregation of complex scattering data
(one look) to multiple looks with attention to the correct handling of magnitude
and phase data.<BR>
<BR>
Begun many years ago,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#CSUF">CSUF</a> 
staff continue to work on the analyses of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data taken
over the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#UC">UC</a> 
Davis Winters site.  Basically, the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
analysis is complete.  We
are waiting for an analysis of optical image data (Landsat

<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Preliminary results, from a general inspection of both the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR data for
common sites support the following significant results.<BR>
<BR>
Proportion-based indices (PIs), in comparison with single-parameters, serve well to
isolate certain biophysical properties of terrestrial landscapes with radar data.
The set of PIs introduced by Pope et al. (1994) work well in hilly landscapes.
In such landscapes, the effects of slope and aspect variations on a given solitary radar magnitude
are severe and detract from their usefulness for estimation of biophysical conditions
on the landscape.  A
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PI">PI</a> 
is based on a ratio-like formulation, B*255/(B + A); thus, with both Raster A and Raster B being affected in the same way by slope and aspect,
these effects divide out in the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PI">PI</a>, 
 and the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PI">PI</a> 
indicates biophysical conditions on
different slopes.  With the availability of both C- and L-band radar parameters,
a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PI">PI</a> 
involving cross polarization parameters at the two different wavelengths is a good
indicator of woody biomass.  These results, first explored by Pope et al. (1994)
in a Belizian test site and later explored by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#CSUF">CSUF</a> 
staff in the Winters test site,
are holding true in the Manaus test site.  The Winters results are significant in that they
indicate that the landscape characterizations needed for turbulent land-air exchange
modeling (Landscapes project,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#UC">UC</a> 
Davis, Dr. K.T. Paw U) can be obtained in part from
multiparameter radar (like that of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a>) 
.  Other parameters needed in the
exchange model are likely to be obtained from optical multispectral data (work in
progress at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#UC">UC</a> 
Davis).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
With all of the requested
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data in hand now (since August, 1995), we are
moving ahead with the analysis phases of our investigation.   We expect, with the
cooperation of our many colleagues at other institutions, to reach many conclusions
with regard to the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
project by the end of FY96.  In fact, we anticipate having
several papers submitted by the time of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
meeting at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#UCSB">UCSB</a> 
in February

Turbulent Exchange at Vegetated Surfaces and Evaluation of Estimates of Canopy Structure
Using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
Data; Ecology Science Team<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
To characterize the turbulent exchanges of momentum, heat and gases from plant surfaces.<BR>
<BR>
To evaluate the effects of foliage density, structure and height on the exchanges.<BR>
<BR>
To evaluate the use of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
remotely sensed data for estimating information
regarding the type, structure, and status of vegetation needed for estimating the
exchanges of momentum, heat and gases.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
We have made moderate progress in obtaining data needed for the analysis of the feasibility
of using SRL data in addition to other remotely sensed data to assess biometeorological-surface
exchange processes.  We have carried out several experiments, and developed several analytical techniques following and surpassing our objectives on the
biometeorological aspects of our projects.  We have used optical data in several
areas and are in the process of analyzing SRL data on the radar aspects of our project.<BR>
<BR>
During the past 1.5 years, we have developed a new wavelet-like technique to analyze
turbulent data, especially in identifying the large 'coherent structures' which are
responsible for the majority of the exchange processes (such as for trace gases and
momentum).  This methodology has yielded results that imply plant height is a very important
scaling factor, along with mean wind speed.  We have also found in related research
that true orthonormal wavelets are not suitable for many types of turbulence research, including some types that have been published (possibly by people jumping on
a trendy bandwagon).  Therefore the method we have developed appears to be a good
alternative.<BR>
<BR>
We have developed a plant-atmosphere biometeorology model which includes a higher-order
closure description of turbulence.  This model now includes current physiological
process models in addition to its sophisticated turbulence description.  A preprint
is listed below, which describes the significant differences (implying errors) between
simpler Si-B like models and higher-order closure models, for predicting global change
responses of canopies.  The higher-order closure model has given insights into the
type of data and the accuracy of data needed by SRL and optical platforms (see below
for a further description).<BR>
<BR>
Important inputs include canopy height, Leaf Area Index (LAI), and a general idea
of the plant type (for inclusion of appropriate plant physiological response parameterization).<BR>
<BR>
In our field experiments, we have begun analysis of the biometeorological data obtained
during the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
overflights for the Howland, Maine site and Davis site.
One preprint describes progress in assessing water vapor and carbon dioxide exchange at the Davis site associated with an
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
overflight intensive field campaign period.
In this and a related preprint we have established that the surface-renewal method,
which depends on knowledge of the canopy height, works reasonably well.<BR>
<BR>
The processing of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AVIRIS">AVIRIS</a> 
optical data for the Davis-Winters site has taken place
and preliminary results include assessment of vegetation type, and therefore an indirect
estimation of canopy height,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#LAI">LAI</a>, 
 and gap fraction.  We are also investigating the measurement of these canopy properties and fraction woodiness, woody biomass, and
water content using radar and optical datasets.  We have evaluated multivariate spectral
mapping of soil types and found we were able to separate very similar soils having
different organic content and texture, properties related to the water holding capacity
differences.  Another aspect of our investigations is to use SRL and optical data
to detect quantify surface heterogeneity at different spatial scales. Current biometeorological models assume homogeneity in the spatial domain and the sharp discontinuities
in flux processes and surface roughness actually found between agricultural fields
violate these simple assumptions.  The turbulence model we are developing should
provide better energy balance estimates using this information on landscape structure.<BR>
<BR>
We have pioneered a new approach to spectral analysis using finite impulse response
filters (FIR) and Gabor transforms (a form of wavelet analysis; we note in passing
that wavelet analysis was originally developed for image processing although it has
been used, sometimes inappropriately, in many other fields).  This method allows us to
separate small spectral signals such as differences in some biochemical properties
of the plant canopy.  It has considerable promise for time-series analyses of landscape
change.  We have also explored the potential for radiative transfer modeling to estimate
canopy biochemicals. We have revised the PROSPECT model to include estimates of pigments,
carbon, nitrogen, and water contents for leaves.  This model has been incorporated into a canopy model, the IAPI model for predicting canopy reflectance and from
satellite sensors.  The biochemical functions from PROSPECT have been incorporated
into a new ray-tracing model of the leaf that explicitly considers leaf cellular
structure.  These new approaches appear promising to provide detailed information on the functional
status of canopies for the biometeorological model.<BR>
<BR>
Radar data processing has been delayed greatly by the lack of time by one of the co-PI's
on the project, Jack Paris.  Originally, all radar data were to be processed by him,
but there have been delays.  Currently, another co-PI, Susan Ustin, is beginning
to analyze the radar data instead, in addition to her general analysis of the optical
data.  Despite these difficulties, we have already written a second draft of a paper
describing research in modeling the sensitivity of exchange estimates to remotely-sensed vegetation parameters.  The higher-order turbulence and biometeorology model is
being used, along with data inputs representing errors in the estimated plant parameters,
obtained from SRL and optical sensors.  This is listed below under the &quot;in preparation&quot; manuscripts.<BR>

<BR>
Use the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
imagery to map spatial patterns of wetland communities and determine
spatial and temporal patterns of inundation in conjunction with a variety of ecological
and geological studies.  These studies include monitoring of breeding sites of the malaria transmitting mosquito, studies of wetland biogeochemical gradients, and
studies of groundwater discharge systems and their relationship to the buried Chicxulub
impact crater.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Polarimetric L- and C-band and XVV radar imagery were acquired for dry (April) and
wet (October) seasons for wetland sites in Chiapas and the Yucatan Peninsula.  Field
campaigns were conducted in both seasons in Chiapas and the Yucatan to record the
biophysical character of the wetlands and to record seasonal changes in flooding.  Analyses
of field data from marshes in the Yucatan have been completed, while analyses of
data from Chiapas and from forested wetlands and mangroves in the Yucatan are still
underway.  <BR>
<BR>
Marshes in Yucatan are dominated by three species of emergent macrophyte: <CITE>Cladium jamaicense</CITE>
(sawgrass), <CITE>Typha domingensis </CITE>
(cattail), and <CITE>Eleocharis cellulosa</CITE>
(rush).  Communities of these three species occur as monospecific stands, mixtures
of monospecific clumps, and mixtures with a single dominant species.  Eleven marsh
sites were studied in detail encompassing a wide variety height, density, and species
composition.  The only significant seasonal change observed in the marshes was in flooding.
Changes from dry to continuously flooded, dry to partially flooded, partially flooded
to continuously flooded, and changes in the depth of continuous flooding were observed in the 11 marsh sites.  All field observations were located with a hand-held

   <a href="Acronyms.html#GPS">GPS</a> 
receiver.<BR>
<BR>
Wet and dry season
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
polarimetric L- and C-band imagery from data take 81.0 have
been georeferenced and coregistered.  Backscatter amplitude 
   (<a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#VV">VV</a>, 
 CS= average
of HV+VH) and phase (|H-V phase difference|=PD) statistics were extracted from the
seasonal images for polygons corresponding to the survey areas of the 11 marsh sites and
from a stable calibration site of closed canopy evergreen forest.  Significant seasonal
changes in amplitude and phase above the calibration limit were then determined for
the marshes.  A similar analysis is currently being conducted for the mangrove and swamp
forest communities within the same coregisterd images and preliminary results have
been obtained.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Increased flooding in marshes can be detected by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
by:  1) an increase in backscatter
magnitude in marshes with tall, dense cover; 2) a decrease in backscatter amplitude
in marshes with short, sparse cover; and 3) an increase in
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PD">PD</a> 
in all types of marshes.  Magnitude increases result from an increase in double bounce interactions between
the emergent vegetation and water surface, while decreases result from an increase
in forward scattering off the open water.  Average
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PD">PD</a> 
values increase due to an absolute or relative increase in double compared to single bounce interactions.  Changes
from dry or partially flooded to completely flooded and increases in water depth
could be detected by most of the polarimetric parameters, but changes from dry to
partially flooded could not. 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#CPD">CPD</a> 
changed significantly for all 11 marshes studies, followed
by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#LPD">LPD</a> 
and LVV (9 marshes) and LHH, LCS, and CVV (7 marshes).  CHH detected significant
changes in five marshes, but produced near significant changes 
(&#177;1.8-1.9 dB) 
in four others.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
An analysis similar to the marsh study summarized above is near completion for mangroves
and swamp forest in the Yucatan test site.  A similar analysis is also planned for
wetlands in the Pacific coastal plain of Chiapas.  The Chiapas sites add an additional suite of wetlands including different marsh species and extensive tall mangroves.<BR>
<BR>
The marsh monitoring capabilities developed in this study are being refined for application
in a Radarsat

<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Ecosystem characterization using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
and AirSAR data.<BR>
<BR>
Improving radar backscatter models for forest canopies.<BR>
<BR>
Using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
measurements and models with forest ecosystem models to improve inferences
of ecosystem attributes and processes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
To date we have analyzed multiple
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data sets for Prince Albert, Canada;
Howland, Maine; and Western Sayani, Siberia.  In addition, we have requested and
received data for Nelson, House, Manitoba; Wallops Island, Virginia  and Voyageurs
National Park, Minnesota.  A brief summary of results follows.<BR>
<BR>


Ecosystem characterization using SAR<BR>
<BR>
Procedures and results of using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data to map forest cover type and above
ground forest biomass were developed and applied to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
X-SAR data of the Canadian
boreal forest (i.e., Prince Albert ,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#BOREAS">BOREAS</a> 
study area).  Forest cover type classification accuracies on the order of 80% were achieved with standard supervised classification
techniques and the multiple frequency and multipolarization radar data.  The results
also show that maps of estimated biomass can be produced that match observed patterns and preliminary ground data.  The sensitivity to boreal forest biomass in our
study area was between 15 and 20 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.
Better sensitivity over the range of biomass in our study was attained using a
ratio of L-band
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HV">HV</a> 
to C-band
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HV">HV</a> 
backscatter.  We also found that using the backscatter
ratio appeared to reduce the difference in backscatter due to different species or
mixtures.  This will be examined further as additional quantitative data become available.<BR>


<BR>
A comparison of the April and October data sets was also conducted to understand the
effects of seasons on the analysis.  Frozen trees and wetter background contributed
to increased backscattering observed in the April data. 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data acquired
during the growing season would be useful to determine the effects of deciduous leaves
on biomass estimation.  Results of  mapping forest cover and biomass in our study
area using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data are encouraging and should be useful for the study of
above  ground carbon in boreal ecosystems.  Sensitivity to biomass was sufficient to map most
of the types of stands in our area, but we need to examine additional ground measurements
to verify this.  We continue to expand the ground truth data base and test these
results in a more rigorous fashion.<BR>
<BR>
An evaluation of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
results with respect to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
in terms of different
wavelengths (i.e. X-band and P-band) and resolution (28 m vs. 12 m)  was performed
for the Howland, Maine Backup Supersite and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#GSFC">GSFC</a> 
Forest Ecosystem Dynamics study
area. 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data was analyzed to classify forest types, estimate above ground biomass
and characterize forest spatial patterns for Howland, Maine. 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
performed
well as compared with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data, but was not able to discriminate forest types
adequately.  Continued work will focus on improving  classification procedures and developing
other techniques for spatial pattern analysis.<BR>
<BR>
Improving radar backscatter models<BR>
<BR>
In retrieval of forest parameters from radar images, one of the major concerns is
the uncertainty or error induced by the variation of  tree size and position.  A
new
   <a href="Acronyms.html#3-D">3-D</a> 
radar backscatter model was developed and tested which takes into account
spatially distributed gaps and clustering of trees.  This spatially explicit,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#3-D">3-D</a> 
model was used
to simulate
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
signatures from a test site in Howland, Maine. The results showed
that the model worked well for our predominately coniferous forest test site by giving good prediction of total backscattering averaged over the site. Significant spatial
correlations between
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
and simulated images were also produced for all frequencies
(P, L and C-band) and polarization combinations 
   (<a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#VV">VV</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#HV">HV</a>) 
.<BR>
<BR>
Forest stands with different spatial patterns (random and clumped) were simulated.
Results indicated that the total backscattering is higher for stands with randomly
positioned trees than for a clumped stand.  The textures of the simulated images
were different because of the different tree position patterns. Lacunarity analysis was performed
on the total
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a> 
backscattering images to reveal this difference.<BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images of forests with hidden objects i.e., 2.43 m corner reflectors and metal
cylinders (radius of 0.5 m and height 1 meter) were simulated for C, L and P bands.
High-resolution (1-meter pixel) and low-resolution (12 meters of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a>) 
 images
were simulated.  The hidden objects were easily visible at L and P bands, but not at C bands.
At C band, because of high attenuation, the hidden targets can only be seen through
forest gaps. The hidden objects were not very distinct in low-resolution images even
though speckles don't exist in these simulated images.<BR>
<BR>
Using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
with forest ecosystem models<BR>
<BR>
Development of algorithms for using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data to infer biomass by using a forest succession
model to simulate forest canopy parameters to run a radar backscatter model.  A gap-type
forest succession model was parameterized to simulate growth and development of a northern hardwood-boreal transitional forest typical of central Maine, USA.
Forest model results of species, bole diameter, stem and crown heights of individual
trees in a stand, plus density of trees were used to run a discontinuous canopy backscatter model to determine radar backscatter coefficients for the simulated forest stands.
Using the model results, relationships of backscatter to forest biomass were developed
and applied to an AirSAR image over a forested area in Maine.  Using only modeled results the derived relationship was found to underestimate biomass.  Calibrating
the model results with limited measurements improved the algorithm significantly.<BR>
<BR>
Applying the calibrated model derived algorithm to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
imagery produced reasonable
results when mapped biomass was limited to 15 kg/m<sup>2</sup> 
or less.  These results can be
improved as the forest and backscatter models are improved. For example a single
species  forest growth function was used in the model.  Parameterizing the growth function
for the species common to the study area would improve the forest composition and
stand structure results.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Since our
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
project is closely allied with  forest ecosystem dynamics research
at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#GSFC">GSFC</a> 
we will continue analyze data over coincident study areas such as Howland,
Maine; Prince Albert, Saskatchewan; Nelson House, Manitoba, Wallops Island, VA, Voyageurs and Itasca Parks in Minnesota and the Western Sayani Mountains, Siberia.  Many
of these data sets have been ordered and received.  The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
Radar Data Center is
to be commended for the prompt attention given to our data requests.<BR>
<BR>
We plan to use
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data to examine the stratification of forest areas based
on general surface cover prior to biomass mapping, the sensitivity of the biomass
mapping to seasonal change of moisture and temperature conditions, the effects of
radar illumination angle, and the combination of microwave and optical remote sensing data
in forest classification and biomass mapping.  Several publications are anticipated
in the near future covering the various topics listed above.<BR>
<BR>
Currently,  radar models do not simulate cross polarized backscatter very well because
of the lack of treatment of multiple scattering.  This in an obvious area of future
work.  Our radar backscatter models will be further improved by incorporating higher-order scatterers.  Radar backscatter modeling will be used to investigate the radar
responses to successional forest structures by using the simulated forests from forest
growth models as inputs.  These modeling results will aid in improvement of forest
parameter retrieval algorithms.<BR>
<BR>
Given the emphasis of topography for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-3">SRL-3</a> 
we plan to explore the use of interferometric

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
for our forest ecosystem research.  The Western Sayani Mountains test area we
are working on with Dr. Slava Kharuk of the Sukachev Forestry Institute in Siberia
poses topographic challenges to our ecosystem analyses.  Fortunately, repeat pass
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 

data was obtained and are being ordered.  The topographic information interferometrically
derived from these data as well as
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DTM">DTM</a> 
data (if available) will be used to improve and extend our current biomass mapping methods to mountainous areas through data
correction for local incidence angle, layover and shadows.<BR>
<BR>
Another extremely interesting possibility is the use of interferometry to estimate
forest stand height.  It may be difficult to retrieve actual heights from interferometry
data because of the uncertainty in the position of scatter centers.  Even this course level of information is useful for the ecosystem models and will aid in development
of algorithms for forest attributes.  We will also explore the possibility of detecting
forest gaps and edges by retrieving heights of scattering centers.<BR>
<BR>
The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
missions are demonstrating the unique capabilities of multiple frequency
and multipolarization
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data for studies of the Earth.  Similar measurements over
a significant portion of the Earth's biomes will produce a unique and valuable source of data for terrestrial ecologists and climatologists.  Global maps of important
terrestrial vegetation parameters derived from these data sets can be used directly
by scientists to gain further understanding of the current &quot;state of the Earth&quot; and
develop insight into the global consequences of climate change.  Thus we look forward
to a third
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
mission that would map significant areas of the worlds forests with
L-band co- and cross polarized channels in addition to the topographic data.<BR>

Polarimetric Radar Observations of Forest State for Determination of Ecosystem Process<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
The objectives of this research are to test the hypotheses that ecologically significant
forest state parameters may be estimated from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data.  These include estimation
of above ground biomass, plant water status, and near surface soil moisture under
certain forest conditions.<BR>
<BR>
Test hypotheses in the northern hardwoods forest community, refine them if necessary,
and establish techniques for retrieving this information from orbital SARs such as
<strong>SIR-C/X-SAR.<BR></strong>
<BR>
This report summarizes (1) recent progress, (2) significant results and (3) research
plans concerning
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
research conducted under
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
Contract No. 951869.  Significant
progress has been made with regards to data acquisition, data analysis and dissemination of results during the 18-month period from March 1994 to August 1995.  The
data have been fully documented and the substantive findings have been thoroughly
reported via technical reports, symposia and journals subject to peer review.  The
research plan for the next two years has two phases: (1) complete the analyses of the Raco
Supersite data and (2) extrapolate significant results and methodologies to other

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
test sites.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
During the past 18 months, research efforts have concentrated on (1) acquisition of
data before, between and during the two SRL missions, (2) reduction, documentation
and distribution of the data, (3) analyses of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
and ancillary data concerning
land-cover classification and retrieval of forest biophysical properties, (4) syntheses
of research results and (5) dissemination of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
activities and data to the general
public.  Progress in each of these areas is briefly reviewed.  The amount of processed

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data for the Raco Supersite was somewhat limited until just recently.  Only
50% of the acquired data takes had been processed and delivered as calibrated
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SLC">SLC</a> 

products prior to 8/15/95.  However, we have received the remaining 50% of the data
within the past two weeks.  All X-SAR data were processed and delivered by May 1995.  Data
acquisition activities completed over the past 18 months include: (1)
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
calibration
support, (2) extensive inventories of land-cover information, (3) updating biometric
surveys of approximately 60 forest stands and (4) in situ observations of moisture,
dielectric, precipitation and temperature conditions during the SRL missions.  Over
35 persons have been involved in these efforts.<BR>
<BR>
Calibration<BR>
<BR>
The calibration activities consisted of deploying arrays of passive and active point
targets of known radar cross-section as well as the measurement of distributed targets
using a truck-mounted polarimetric scatterometer.  In support of both
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

and associated under flights by the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a>, 
 these targets were repositioned, as
needed, to optimize performance for each overpass.  The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#3-D">3-D</a> 
differentially processed

   <a href="Acronyms.html#GPS">GPS</a> 
coordinates were obtained for each target and forwarded to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
during each mission,
along with the expected
   <a href="Acronyms.html#RCS">RCS</a> 
of each target, for use in the initial calibration of the

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data.  The distributed target measurements are being used under separate contract
to improve estimates of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
distortion matrices.  Accurate calibration of both amplitude and phase are essential for application of robust quantitative algorithms.<BR>
<BR>
Land-Cover Classification<BR>
<BR>
Much effort has been put into activities supporting land-cover classification using

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a>. 
  Classification is an essential precursor to accurate retrievals of
geophysical properties (i.e., soil moisture) and biophysical properties (i.e., biomass).
Small aircraft were chartered in April and October 1994 to acquire both video and still
photography  during each of the SRL missions.  A 30-km x 50-km region surrounding
the Raco Supersite was imaged.  This imagery augments ground-level surveys and photography to document land-cover and land-use conditions over both the forested portion
of the supersite and an adjacent agricultural area.  These qualitative data are used
in conjunction with more detailed quantitative information obtained for approximately
60 forest stands and 30 non-forested areas to provide independent training and testing
populations used in development and evaluation of a land-cover classification.<BR>
<BR>
To date, we have tested both simple hierarchical knowledge-based approaches to classification
and also optimized Baysian classifiers (as well as hybrid techniques).  For purposes
of technique development and extension of prior results based upon
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data, our efforts have concentrated thus far on a small number of data sets,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 

data take 6.1 (at 31  incidence angle) and data take 22.2 (at 21  incidence angle)
for both
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and -2.  Our approach has been to (1) define and optimize a classification technique, (2) evaluate the role of azimuth angle and temporal effects (day-to-day
variation in scene dielectric properties and seasonal phenologic changes) on classifier
stability, (3) evaluate effects of angle of incidence on classification and (4) investigate the improvement in classification afforded by either multitemporal or multiangle
classification techniques.  Classifications developed using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data have been
successfully extended to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data and confirm expectations.  Greater than
90% classification accuracy is generally achieved when land-cover classes are defined
on the basis of structural attributes.  Multitemporal classifications show some improvement
over single-date classifications due primarily to phenologic changes in the crown layer.  The SAR-based classifications provide structural information not possible
using optical techniques.<BR>
<BR>
Biomass Retrieval<BR>
<BR>
Biometric surveys were conducted of approximately 60 forest stands within the Raco
Supersite during the four-year period from 1990 to 1993.  During a two-week period
in July 1994, a team of 16 persons, including a group of high school students selected
by the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth, reinventoried 22 of the youngest stands
for which annual growth leads to a significant percent change in total biomass.
Approximately 20,000 stems were measured during this period.  In addition, new allometric
equations were generated on the basis of our data to estimate tree height from diameter
and then applied to the full sample population of over 70,000 tree stems to provide
an updated data base of forest biomass concurrent with the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data.  This
data base represents an investment of over 12,000 hours of effort.  During the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

missions in April, August and October, on site teams of about 15 persons collected
daily measurements of moisture, density, temperature and dielectric properties of
soil, snow and vegetation for a representative subsample of the 60 forest stands within
the Raco Supersite.  Surface roughness was also characterized at two scales for a
subset of the forest stands using surveying equipment over 50-m transects and photographs of 2-m roughness panels to record micro relief.  In addition, leaf area index was
measured for all forest stands during August and September using a techniques based
on the optical transmittance of the canopy.  These data have been processed, edited
and published in two technical reports.<BR>
<BR>
The biomass data have been merged with the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data and completely analyzed
for two data takes (SRL-1: 6.2 and 102.41); another pair of data takes are partially
analyzed (data take 22.2 on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and -2).  A semi-empirical technique has been developed and tested that uses a three-step approach to yield final estimates of crown, trunk
and total above-ground standing biomass.  The approach utilizes the SAR-based land-cover
classification, then estimates average tree height and basal area which in turn are used to estimate trunk-layer biomass.  These estimates have been found to be highly
accurate, and are generally within 10% of the allometrically-determined values (which
themselves have associated uncertainties on the order of 15%).  Hence, the SAR-based results are comparable to or better than those from detailed ground-based surveys
costing on the order of $1,000/ha.  These initial results have generated a high level
of excitement within the ecological and forestry communities.<BR>
<BR>
Soil Moisture<BR>
<BR>
The descending passes of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
acquired data over an agricultural region immediately
to the southeast of the Raco Supersite.  During
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a>, 
 detailed observations were
made of vegetation cover (i.e., type, height, biomass, moisture, leaf area index),
surface roughness and soil properties (moisture, density and dielectric constant).
The soil data were collected on a daily basis during the last half of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
(repeat
orbit phase).  These data have been edited, compiled and published in a technical
report.  The purpose of these data is to test and validate improved algorithms to estimate
near-surface soil moisture beneath short vegetation covers.  The data are not yet
analyzed for this purpose.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the conduct of experimental activities and analyses of the data, our
team has contributed to a number of other associated activities.  One or two team
members have attended all
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
Team and Working Group meetings.  We contributed
heavily to the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NRC">NRC</a> 
review.  A significant additional effort was put into (1) providing &quot;real-time&quot;
analyses of land-cover classification and biomass retrieval during both
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
-2, (2) provision of both studio interviews and on site video of experimental activities for the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
Public Information Office, (3) approximately 20 interviews with radio,
television and print journalists, (4) classroom instruction and teacher assistance
at the high school level as part of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
Public Education Initiative and (5)
seminars and workshops to disseminate
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
results to working ecologists and foresters
at the Hiawatha National Forest.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>


<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
During the next two years, further analyses of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data will be conducted
in two phases: (1) complete analyses of the Raco Supersite data and (2) extend the
methodology and algorithms to other
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
sites.  During the first phase, land-cover
classification and biomass retrieval methodologies and algorithms will be completely evaluated
using the full set of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and -2
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data.  For both activities, temporal variations
in scene dielectric properties and phenologic conditions will be evaluated using same angle pairs of data takes both within a mission (day-to-day variation) and between

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and -2 (seasonal variation).  The effects of angle of incidence will be evaluated
using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data that range from 
20&#176;
  to 
44&#176;
  for a common azimuth view angle.  The effects of azimuth viewing angle will be evaluated using data from three
viewing directions but with two sets of common incidence angles 
(approximately 
20&#176;
and 
30&#176;
).  This work is being done as part of a Ph.D. thesis.  The added benefits
of multitemporal or multiangle classification will also be evaluated.  The semi-empirical technique
for retrieval of biomass requires certain ancillary data for each forest structural
type, a more theoretical approach that does not require this information will be
tested with a subset of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data.  Finally, analyses will be conducted
for purposes of soil moisture retrieval using the data acquired during SRL-2; the
algorithms to be used are being developed under separate contract.  All of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

data for the Raco Supersite have been processed and delivered for the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SLC">SLC</a> 
&quot;calibrated&quot;
product.  The only additional processing that we need is for geo-coded products.
We have found that our efforts have been considerably slowed by the absence of such
a product and foresee great difficulty in extension of the Raco Supersite results to
other regions of even modest relief until such a product is developed and distributed.<BR>
<BR>
During the second phase, those techniques and algorithms found to be useful at the
Raco Supersite will be tested at other
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
sites.  This will allow us to
test for robustness and take advantage of the ancillary data acquired at other
   <a href="Acronyms.html#US">US</a> 

and foreign supersites.  The ecology supersites will be used for this purpose.  First, we will
test the algorithms in biomes similar to the region of development (i.e., at Howland
and Duke Forest), then the techniques will be assessed at other sites primarily those
in Europe.  Some of the processed
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data have already been made available to us
for this purpose.  We do not expect to be requesting additional
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
processing
beyond what is requested by site PIs for this purpose.<BR>

Information Extraction from Shuttle Radar Images for Forest and Agricultural Applications<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
The experiment will attempt to extract suitable polarimetric information for objectives
of forest mapping and vegetation monitoring as well as for agricultural purposes.
<BR>
<BR>
In forest areas in Bavaria (e.g., near the Oberpfaffenhofen supersite and in the Bavarian
Forest) and in the Harz Mountains, shuttle data are to be evaluated for different
forest formations, age classes and other forest parameters and for the forest situation, e.g., concerning storm damages.<BR>
<BR>
In the rainforest study areas in Brazil, especially in the states of Acre and Rondonia,

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR data are to be analyzed for differentiation of land cover classes
like primary rainforest, initial and intermediate regrowth, clean pastures and overgrown pastures. By comparison of April and October data, information is to be gained
on the dynamics of deforestation by clearing and burning and on other land use changes.<BR>
<BR>
In the supersite Oberpfaffenhofen, the potential for crop classification is to be
investigated, in comparison to other test sites like Montespertoli and Matera. The
effect on polarimetric backscatter responses is to be studied in relation to biomass
and biophysical parameters of vegetation, especially for agricultural purposes. The assessment
of soil moisture conditions is another aspect under study in the Oberpfaffenhofen/Weilheim
area and in a test site in Gujarat/India.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Forest investigations in the test site Oberpfaffenhofen   <BR>
<BR>
Four data takes of April and October 94 have been investigated for the multipolarimetric
and multifrequency information content of different land use classes, especially<BR>
for forest areas and storm damage areas near the lake &quot;Ammersee&quot; and a region NE of
Oberpfaffenhofen. Signature analysis of different polarization states has been performed
in preparation of land use classification. In the region West of Ammersee a land
cover classification has been performed using combined
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data.<BR>
<BR>
The X-SAR data takes have been studied for time variation effects, e.g., for different
moisture conditions during the first and the second mission. Also interferometric
datasets have been studied from the October mission. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Forest investigations in the test sites of Harz Mountains and Bavarian Forest<BR>
<BR>
First investigations have been performed on the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data in the mountainous
terrain of the Harz Mountains and the Bavarian Forest. Both forest areas are partly
severely affected by forest damages, e.g., by storm damages and bark beetle calamities.
In order to be able to combine the data with geocoded reference data, e.g., in a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#GIS">GIS</a> 

environment, geocoded terrain corrected
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data are necessary (besides available

   <a href="Acronyms.html#GTC">GTC</a> 
products of the X-SAR component) in these areas of high relief. Terrain corrected
multiband/ multiseasonal data are planned to be available in May/June 1996, within
an initiative of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DLR">DLR</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DARA">DARA</a>. 
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Investigations for rainforest monitoring in Acre and Rondonia, Brazil<BR>
<BR>
In the area of Sena Madureira and Rio Branco in the state of Acre, Brazil, two
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

data takes of April 1994 and one of October have been studied for rainforest monitoring
tasks, in cooperation with the National Brasilian Space Research Institute. Objectives are the differentiation within the rainforest and within the deforested
areas (different states of pasture land and regeneration areas). By comparing X-SAR
datasets of the April and the October mission, the dynamics in deforestation have
been shown in an area NW of Rio Branco. Based on the field work in June/July 1994, analysis
of backscatter responses in L-, C- and X-Band have been performed for forest, pasture
and regrowth areas. In a region of 40 km by 40 km NW of Rio Branco, a landcover classification has been performed using the textural classifier EBIS, mainly based on different
polarizations of L-Band data.<BR>
<BR>
In the state of Rondonia, a region near the town Ji Parana has been investigated by
several
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
/ X-SAR datasets of April and October 1994. These datasets have been
registered within the Amazon calibration experiment and as part of the &quot;Pantanal&quot;
data take. In November 1995, a first ground campaign has been performed in cooperation with

   <a href="Acronyms.html#INPE">INPE</a> 
and other Brasilian institutions. Different states of land use are under study,
showing different land use intensities as well as different degradation and regeneration states. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Investigation of agricultural areas in the study sites of Oberpfaffenhofen, Montespertoli
and Matera<BR>
<BR>
In the Oberpfaffenhofen supersite, investigations for early crop identification have
been performed by sets of April data, based on ground truth assessment during the
overflights. Methodological studies show the different information content of different
polarization/ band combinations. On a field-based approach (field limits coming from
other sources), crop classifications have been performed by methods of polarimetric
contrast and maximum likelihood classification. <BR>
<BR>
The potential for the assessment of different growth states of winter wheat is under
study by comparing the backscatter responses of winter wheat in the different climatic
regions of Oberpfaffenhofen, Montespertoli and Matera. <BR>
<BR>
In the test site Weilheim, Southwest of Oberpfaffenhofen, parallel registered airborne
E-SAR data are investigated in comparison to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data. In this area, the
study of soil moisture conditions is the main objective. <BR>
<BR>
Investigation of soil moisture and vegetation cover in Gujarat/India <BR>
<BR>
By the Indian Co-Investigator, several
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR datasets, mainly from April
1994, are under study for soil moisture and vegetation cover in a region of Gujarat
in India.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT PRESENT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Forest investigations in the test site Oberpfaffenhofen <BR>
<BR>
In the forest area West of the lake Ammersee, ten landcover classes including five
forest types could be classified with an overall classification accuracy of about
63 %, in an area which has a quite inhomogeneous distribution of land cover. Storm
damaged areas could be separated by about 70% accuracy, the forest / nonforest separation
accuracy is around 95 %. C-Band
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HV">HV</a> 
polarization seems to be important for structure
identification between deciduous and coniferous forest. L-Band
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HV">HV</a> 
has a high correlation
to natural forest age classes and biomass. Interesting is the result of using a three-date
multitemporal complex X-SAR data set of the October mission. By an interferometric
processing, the interferometric coherence of a one-day repeat cycle can be successfully be used to improve the classification of five main land cover classes, in addition
to the three-date multitemporal X-SAR data set. <BR>
<BR>
Investigations for rainforest monitoring in Acre and Rondonia, Brazil<BR>
<BR>
Investigations of different polarimetric states of L- and C-band showed a better forest
/ non-forest separation in the L-band data, especially in the regeneration states.
L-band HH-Polarization allowed the separation of alluvial rainforest areas along
rivers. Integration of C-band and X-band data delivered a better differentiation of pasture
land. For land use classification, the EBIS texture tool was successful which allows
the integration of texture parameters for classification besides the evaluation of
local histograms. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Investigation of agricultural areas in the study sites of Oberpfaffenhofen <BR>
<BR>
Astonishing positive results have been reached in the Oberpfaffenhofen test site for
early crop identification, using a five-band combination of all three frequencies.
L-HV has proven to be an important layer also for this mapping, based on field-wise
classification.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Forest Monitoring Investigations in the Harz Mountains and in the Bavarian Forest
are planned to be performed, based on terrain-corrected, combined
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
products
from the April and October missions. Storm damages and insect calamities are a heavy
problem in those areas, e.g., the bark beetle damages in the area of the  Bavarian Forest
National Park.<BR>
<BR>
Rainforest and Deforestation Monitoring Investigations will be continued, the results
of the study sites of Acre (Sena Madureira) and Rondonia (Pantanal data takes) are
to be compared with results from other projects in the Manaus test site. Different
approaches are planned to get information for biomass estimates especially for forest
regrowth, in cooperation with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#INPE">INPE</a>, 
 Brazil.<BR>
<BR>
Investigations for crop identification will be continued, including October data takes.<BR>

Geologic and Hydrologic Studies of Saudi Arabia Under the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C
(SIR-C) Science Plan<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery to detect lithological boundaries, distinguish
tectonic features, map fluvial geomorphology, and elucidate hydrologic systems within
larger areas of Saudi Arabia having a thin sand cover.<BR>
<BR>
Establish the Pleistocene paleodrainage system of Saudi Arabia with implications for
the hydrology of the country and possibly for archeological geology.<BR>
<BR>
Assess the effects of sand terrain diversities on backscatter intensity as a function
of radar parameters.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
During each of the Space Shuttle Endeavor missions in April and October 1994, fourteen
data takes were acquired by the Space Radar Laboratory-1 and -2 (SRL-1 and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a>) 

over the Arabian Peninsula (<a href="gifs/dabbagh1.gif">Figure 1</a>). 
The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
L-band data from both the
missions on CD-ROMs have been received. These data have been processed, analyzed, and interpreted
to assess their significance for mapping geological and hydrological features in
the Arabian Peninsula.<BR>
<BR>
The main objectives of this study are: 1) assess the sand penetration capability of
L- band radar in an eolian environment, 2) conduct digital image processing experiments
on the multiparameter data sets and merge radar data with Landsat images, and 3)
detect lithological  boundaries, distinguish tectonic features, and map hydrological
systems (surface and subsurface).<BR>
<BR>
The L-band survey mode data (50-meter resolution) have been processed and printed
at a 1:500,000 scale. The geological interpretation of all fourteen data takes over
the Arabian Peninsula  from 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
 have been  completed, and the interpretation
of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
data is in progress. The general interpretation  of the radar data has revealed  several
previously unmapped geologic structures which are  being further investigated (see
results). Detailed evaluation of radar subsurface penetration and eolian sand deposit mapping is also in progress.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
The interpretation of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
data has indicated instances of L-band penetration
in loose dry sand. Stream drainage patterns which are either on the surface or covered
by a thin layer of sand were visible on the radar images.  Several faults, folds, and joints which are not visible on optical remote sensing images and are not shown
on existing geologic maps, were identifiable on the radar images. These findings
are described for four designated sites, viz. Test sites 1 through 4 
(<a href="gifs/dabbagh2.gif">Figure 2</a>),
in the subsequent sections.<BR>
<BR>
Sand Penetration of L-Band<BR>
<BR>
Test site 1 was selected to investigate the L-band sand penetration capability. 
<a href="gifs/dabbagh3.gif">
Figure 3 </a>
shows Landsat
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TM">TM</a> 
coverage of this site.  The area consists of a coastline, sabkhas,
sand dunes, and sand sheets. The sand sheet and sand dune areas, designated as A
and B in the image, have sand thicknesses of 2-3 meters. As can be seen from 
<a href="gifs/dabbagh4.gif">
Figures 4 (C-band) </a>
and 
<a href="gifs/dabbagh5.gif">
5 (L-band), </a>
the sand cover disappears on the L-band images, whereas
it is visible on C-band at both designated areas A and B, indicating L-band penetration
of the sand cover. For further verification of L-band sand penetration capability, one
of the corner reflectors was buried under 2 meters of sand to be imaged during the

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
mission, but unfortunately, the site was  not imaged. Ground data collection
for penetration verification is in progress.<BR>
<BR>
Mapping Of Paleo-Drainage Channels<BR>
<BR>
The paleo-drainage mapping capability of L-band radar has been investigated at two
sites, one in Nafud Al-Mazhur, Test site 2 
(<a href="gifs/dabbagh2.gif">Figure 2</a>),
 and the other in Southern
Rubal Khali, Test site 3 
(<a href="gifs/dabbagh2.gif">Figure 2</a>).
 Both of these sites have drainage systems, parts
of which are either filled or covered with sand and, hence, are suitable for the assessment
of radar data to detect both exposed and buried drainage channels.<BR>
<BR>
Landsat
   <a href="Acronyms.html#MSS">MSS</a> 
and L-band radar images of Nafud Al Mazhur, test site 2, comprising bedrock,
sand sheets, and drainage channels are shown in 
<a href="gifs/dabbagh6.gif">

Figure 6 </a>
which

image, there is little contrast between drainage channel beds and
the adjacent bedrock and, hence, the drainage channels are not pronounced. The dry
channels which are either floored or filled with layers of wind-blown silt and sand
produce very low radar returns and appear dark gray on the L-band radar image 
(<a href="gifs/dabbagh7.gif">Figure 7</a>).
  The adjacent bedrock has rough angular surfaces that produce strong radar returns
and appear bright on the radar image. The contrast between drainage channels and
the adjacent bedrock surfaces strongly enhances the drainage pattern seen in 
<a href="gifs/dabbagh7.gif">

 the L-band radar image. The medium gray tones in the middle of the image 
(<a href="gifs/dabbagh7.gif">Figure 7</a>),
 represent
a thin cover of sand sheet. In the Landsat

image 
(<a href="gifs/dabbagh6.gif">Figure 6</a>)
 one of the major
channels is barely visible where it crosses the sand sheet in the middle of the image. However, the same channel can be traced further on the radar image, suggesting
penetration of radar signals through the sand. Since the radar images used in this
analysis are low resolution survey mode<BR>
data, improved results are expected from the interpretation of the full resolution
data, which is currently being acquired from

dotted lines on this map represent possible extensions of drainage systems which
need to be validated. The improved radar L-band detection of paleo-drainage channels, at the
two sites, demonstrates its ability to define paleo-drainage channels under thin
sand cover, and should help in updating existing understanding of the hydrology and
paleo-climate of the Arabian Peninsula. <BR>
<BR>
Mapping Of Geologic Structures<BR>
<BR>
The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data strips traversing some 50,000 km cross the land area of the Arabian
Peninsula 
(<a href="gifs/dabbagh1.gif">Figure 1</a>),
 provide a unique, synoptic view of the geology of this largely
remote and barren desert terrain. Interpretation of these data, with the aid of Landsat
   <a href="Acronyms.html#MSS">MSS</a> 
images and geologic maps, have revealed faults, joints, folds, and formation
contacts which are not clearly visible on Landsat images or on published maps.<BR>
<BR>
An exciting example of thin sand cover penetration and enhancement of a major fault
is present along Wadi Sahba, Test site 4 
(<a href="gifs/dabbagh2.gif">Figure 2</a>). The L-band radar image, and
its geologic interpretation, are shown in 
<a href="gifs/dabbagh12a.gif">
Figures 12a </a>
and 
<a href="gifs/dabbagh12b.gif">
12b. </a>
This radar image extends
across a section of Wadi Sahba where the lower Tertiary strata of the Umm Er Radhuma
limestone are largely covered by Ad Dhana sand. To the north of the Wadi Sahba fault,
the drainage pattern and karst terrain, incised in the bedrock below the dune sand,
are clearly visible on the radar image 
(<a href="gifs/dabbagh12a.gif">Figure 12a</a>),
 but are not apparent south of the
Wadi Sahba fault. The fault is clearly shown here by its linear character, but can
only be inferred from other types of remote sensing images or geologic maps. Immediately
to the south of the fault, that is the topographically low side, dark tone is the result
of low radar return from thick sand dunes and alluvium, thus providing the strong
contrast which defines the fault trace. Further southward, thick sand yields to thin
sand  below which the karstified Tertiary limestone and marl is once again revealed.
On maps and Landsat images this is all shown as Ad Dahna sand dunes with scattered
small outcrops.  This is an excellent example of sand penetration by the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

L-band radar exposing geologic structure which is not apparent from other geologic data.<BR>
<BR>
Detailed field investigation of the new evidence provided by the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data
for the extension of the Nisah-Sahba fault, a major fault zone in the vicinity of
the oil rich Khurais and Ghawar anticlines, is being conducted and results are anticipated
to be published in an international journal.<BR>
<BR>
The overall results of geologic interpretation of the L-band image strips indicate
that the radar images complement and enhance other remote sensing data and provide
a new and unique view of the geologic structures.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>

Climate Change and Neotectonic History of Northwestern China<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
To compare the types, rates, and magnitudes of surficial modification processes that
have operated in NW China and the SW U.S.<BR>
<BR>
To quantify and understand the basis of the remote sensing signatures of these processes
to allow extrapolation from field sites to regional maps and to allow comparisons
between widely separated arid regions.<BR>
<BR>
To use the resulting chronologies to help define the temporal and spatial distribution
of continental climate changes.<BR>
<BR>
Determine the ages of movements on some of the active faults in NW China.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Extensive
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
coverage was obtained with the two flights of SRL. Approximately
30 swaths were obtained that nearly mosaic to cover a large percentage of the region
of northwestern Tibet, the Kun Lun Mountains, and southwestern Tarim Basin. This
region contains many examples of landforms produced by past climate changes that have
not been buried by the extensive loess deposits more common to the east. The region
is also host to large faults, similar to California's San Andreas strike-slip fault
and the blind thrust faults of Los Angeles Basin. From the NW China swaths, approximately
25
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and 40 X-SAR scenes have been processed, of which about 10 have been analyzed
in depth for a just-completed field trip.<BR>
<BR>
Other data sets have also been used in this investigation: Landsat
   <a href="Acronyms.html#MSS">MSS</a> 
images provided
synoptic coverage;
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPOT">SPOT</a> 
images geocoded by Eric Fielding provided valuable high-resolution
coverage of the main site;
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
image coverage of the test sites has proved useful for regional coverage; both
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
interferometric pairs were processed
by Eric Fielding to produce DEMs of the main test site. The DEMs will be important
for studies of the alluvial fans and their fault offsets and potentially lake shorelines.<BR>
<BR>
An important step in the investigation was accomplished in August: A one-month field
expedition. Participating were Farr, Evans, Chadwick, Peltzer, Doug Clark (a graduate
student of Alan Gillespie's), and Rick Ryerson (specializing in cosmogenic dating
techniques at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL). The Chinese fielded a team of five from the Institute for Remote Sensing Applications (IRSA), including Dr. Guo Huadong
(the director) and four other scientists that were interested in paleoclimatology and neotectonics.<BR>
<BR>
Objectives for the field work included: relative dating of fan surfaces, terraces, and moraines; collection of samples for soil descriptions, and for thermoluminescence, cosmogenic nuclide, and carbon dating; mapping and correlation of fan units, te
rraces, moraines, cirques; measurement of fault offsets of fans, terraces, and moraines; collection of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#GCP">GCP</a> 
for stereo
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPOT">SPOT</a> 
and INSAR data reduction.<BR>
<BR>
Four main sites were targeted: 1) Hotien Faults. Same area as visited by Farr, Evans, Peltzer,
Avouac (Avouac and Peltzer, 1993). East of Hotien, between Lop and Qira. Interest
was in normal faults and terraces. 2) Yecheng Folds. Along road between Hotien and
Yecheng. Main interests were folds in gravel beds, road and stream cuts, and terraces. 3)
Karakax Valley in Kun Lun Mountains. Main interests were in glacier moraines, alluvial
fans on sides of valley, and terraces in larger side valleys. 4) Aksayqin Basin.
Area around Aksayqin Hu and from Karakax Valley road to Lung Mu Co, and to Gozha Co, including
up to the large ice cap north of Gozha Co. Main interests were alluvial fans on edges
of basin, shorelines around lakes, volcanic deposits, and glaciers coming off the ice cap.<BR>
<BR>
All four of the sites were visited, with most of the field time spent in the Karakax Valley. Sites one and two proved less amenable to remote sensing investigations because of the thickness of
loess covering the surfaces.  However, interesting observations relative to the folding
and faulting of young gravels at the front of the Kun Lun were made, and samples were collected that may allow dating of the deformation. Activities in the Karakax Valley
centered on mapping of moraines to constrain the glacial history and detailed mapping
and sampling of several alluvial fans. Salt weathering is a much more important process in this area than was realized, however, sampling strategies to minimize its impact on the dating of the fans and moraines
were devised in the field. The visit to the Aksayqin Basin, at over 5000 m, was in
a reconnaissance mode, to gather information on the moraines and shorelines for potential
future study. The glacial history appears to be consistent with that for the Karakax
Valley. The shorelines were spectacular, and it is probable that with some good DEMs from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
a study of the lake history of the area would
yield useful results. One of the Chinese scientists along on the trip may be interested
in pursuing this topic.<BR>
<BR>
Approximately 250 kg of samples were collected and shipped back to the U.S. for analysis
of soil formation processes and for dating of the surfaces using thermoluminescence
and the relatively new technique of cosmogenic nuclide measurement. The latter technique makes use of the fact that various isotopes (e.g., Be10, Al26, He3, Cl36) build up in the surface layers of rocks exposed to cosmic
rays. The production rates for these nuclides are relatively well known, so the amount
of a given nuclide can be used to calculate the duration of exposure. The technique
has been used for several years, and has proved to be fairly reliable, if geologic conditions
are adequately accounted for.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to my main investigation, I have supported two Associate Investigators: Dr. Guo Huadong's investigation of the use of radar remote
sensing at several test sites in China, and the archaeological investigations of
China's Silk Road by How-Man Wong and Derrold Holcomb. My major activities with Dr.
Guo have been to advise on coverage and parameter options for his sites. For the Silk Road
investigations, I have helped plan coverage, ordered processed scenes, and analyzed the data.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Using the remote sensing data, it was predicted that the processes acting in the Karakax
Valley were different from those in the SW U.S. Specifically, it appeared that loess deposition was the dominant process, making the area more similar to central Nevada than to Death Valley.  The field
work just completed added to this interpretation, finding that salt weathering was
also important, preventing the formation of thick coatings of desert varnish.<BR>
<BR>
Another result of the field work will be at least three press releases: On the faulting and folding in the Tarim Basin, the glaciers of the
Aksayqin Basin, and remote sensing of the oases along the Silk Road.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
The major emphases for the next two years will be on 1) determination of remote sensing signatures of surfaces, 2) sample analyses for dating the surfaces, and 3) topographic analyses of faults and fans. Most of the radar data are already in hand;
few additional
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
or X-SAR scenes will likely be requested. Additional images
from other sensors are needed, however.  Additional
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPOT">SPOT</a> 
scenes are needed, for their
high resolution, to help in mapping some of the landforms, and Landsat
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TM">TM</a> 
data are needed to add the multispectral, visible near-infrared channels which are sensitive to soil formation and desert varnish development.
These additional data sets will allow mapping and correlation of fan units over the
entire valley as well as better, more quantitative comparisons with the SW U.S.<BR>
<BR>
Sample analyses will require significant funding over the next fiscal year.  A cooperative arrangement has been reached between Alan Gillespie at the University of Washington (UW), Rick Ryerson at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), and
myself for sharing the costs of cosmogenic dating of the samples. If the dating
works as we hope, significant progress will be made in understanding the glacial
chronology and landscape evolution in this part of the world. This will feed into
ongoing studies of lakes, glaciers, ice caps, rivers, and oases being pursued by a variety
of researchers. Successful dating of these surfaces will prove a major breakthrough.<BR>
<BR>
As with the remote sensing part of the investigations, topographic analyses require
little additional data. The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PI">PI</a> 
has an ongoing (unfunded) ERS-1/2 investigation which
will provide any needed interferometric
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data.  One
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
interferometric swath
over the area has already been processed, as has a single
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
pair. These data will
be used with models of alluvial fan formation to help constrain the uplift and offset
histories of the fans in the Karakax Valley.  This will also provide a way to compare
quantitatively fans in NW China with the SW U.S.<BR>
<BR>
Further in the future, two new areas of study may develop: Monitoring the evolution of oases, and Determination
of paleolake shoreline elevations.  Field observations indicate that the oases of
the southern Taklamakan Desert enjoy a marginal existence. Extreme vigilance is necessary to protect the oases from erosion by desertification and moving dunes.  The past
history of the Silk Road is further proof that the area is susceptible to climatic
shifts. Radar and other remote sensing techniques may be used to monitor the health
of the oases and to search for changes in the land brought about by climate changes. This
will be explored using historical remote sensing data sets. A graduate student at
Caltech is currently interested in this project.<BR>
<BR>
As discussed earlier, the new DEMs produced by interferometric
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
provide data that
may be used to map accurately shoreline levels from past lakes in western Tibet.
Accurate maps may be used to deduce climate changes through water-balance models,
and to observe tectonic tilts, if present. Scientists at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IRSA">IRSA</a> 
are interested in this project,
which could be combined with results from recent French expeditions to the area.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, as this project winds down, an effort will be made to archive all the remote
sensing, field, and laboratory results onto one or more recordable CD-ROMs so that
future researchers will be able to reconstruct these important data sets.<BR>

Alluvial Fan Evolution in the Western Great Basin<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Describe systematic morphologic changes with surface age in terms of multiparameter
radar backscatter for dated chronosequences on alluvial fans at one or two sites
in the Western Great Basin.  Compare these changes to chemical weathering patterns

<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Summary of Activities Since February 1995<BR>
<BR>
Organized field trip and field workshop in Death Valley, California.  This was attended
by members of various science teams.<BR>
<BR>
Made combined measurements of roughness, close-up
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VNIR">VNIR</a> 
multispectral images, and field
spectrometer data in Death Valley, designed to test joint SAR/VNIR analysis of roughness.<BR>
<BR>
Fifty low altitude (1:1000 scale) aerial photographs obtained over alluvial fans in
the Stovepipe Wells area of Death Valley.<BR>
<BR>
Roughness estimates obtained at two spatial scales using stereo photography:  The
subcentimeter to meter scale, and the 10's cm to 10's meters scale.  Available roughness
spectra now span four orders of magnitude in length scale at ten sites in Death Valley.<BR>
<BR>
Developed and installed software designed to simulate natural rough surfaces and to
calculate the radar backscatter from them.  The solutions use complete solutions
of Maxwell's equations.  This software complements our currently available radiosity
models which calculate
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VNIR">VNIR</a> 
reflectance for the same rough surfaces, including the effects
of multiple scattering interactions.<BR>
<BR>
Collected samples from alluvial fan surfaces of various ages in Death Valley.  In
conjunction with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#LLNL">LLNL</a> 
we will be dating the ages of the surfaces.<BR>
<BR>
Currently participating in field work in China with

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
scenes over Death Valley, one over Owens Valley,
two over the Amazon Basin, and one over Hawaii.  Requested and obtained a number
of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a>

<BR>
Negotiations with Bruce Jakosky on submission of three papers to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
special of

<BR>
Two manuscripts are in preparation for

<BR>
We will be presenting invited talks at the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IEEE">IEEE</a> 
conference in Toulouse, France on
&quot;Retrieval of bio- and geophysical parameters from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data for land applications&quot;.
We have also been invited to present a talk at the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
workshop at the University
of New South Wales, Australia in November 1995.<BR>
<BR>
Requested and obtained day/night flights of the C130 aircraft to collect

photography over Death Valley and Owens Valley.<BR>
<BR>
We have made considerable progress towards our goal of using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images to recover
roughness and moisture information for desert chronosequences. We have begun to understand
what parameters of surface roughness description are important in controlling radar backscatter, and hence how we might expect to be able to invert
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data for roughness
information.  Admittedly, some of our progress has consisted of discovering and documenting
unanticipated, but inherent complexities.  We have, however, shown that joint analysis of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VNIR">VNIR</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images is feasible and improves quantitative roughness
recovery.  We have explored the possibility of ground water correction using g-ray
data and we have explored the use of apparent thermal inertia to correct desert scenes
for dielectric changes other than those due to soil moisture.  We have collected a large
quantity of field data in Death Valley, Owens Valley, Hawaii, China and Australia
for the purposes of documenting roughness, dielectric, spectral characteristics,
and age of surfaces.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Since February, we have advanced our efforts to evaluate the techniques of determination
of surface roughness from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VNIR">VNIR</a> 
data.  Our interest is in the joint use
of data types as well as their separate use.  In addition, within the last month,
day/night pair
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TIMS">TIMS</a> 
data, as well as NS-001, have been taken over Death Valley and
Owens Valley at our request (C130 flights).  We will be examining the joint use of

   <a href="Acronyms.html#TIMS">TIMS</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
in determination of the ground dielectric constant by taking advantage
of a physical relationship between thermal inertia and dielectric constant.  The availability
of these data mean that we will be able to bring three independent data types to
bear on the problem of remote determination of roughness and dielectric constant.
We are particularly interested in the use of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#FIR">FIR</a> 
filters, a generalization of the linear
mixing approach, for analysis of these combinations and types of data.  Our field
measurements (Figure 1) and the semi-empirical models of Dubois et al., and J. C.
Shi, will be used to test our approach and we will also be evaluating the success of these
models.  In the Winter of 94/95 we commissioned low altitude stereo aerial photographs
to be taken over Death Valley alluvial fans at a scale of 1:1000 (Figure 1).  We
now have roughness results from these photographs which overlap in spatial scale with roughness
determinations made on the ground using close-up stereo photography (Figure 2).
Data delineating roughness on the alluvial fans, and covering four orders of magnitude of spatial scale, now exist for ten sites in the Stovepipe Wells area (Figures
1 &amp; 2).  These measurements are to be used in evaluating the success of inversions
of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#VNIR">VNIR</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TIMS">TIMS</a> 
data for dielectric and roughness.  Close-up stereo photographs
have also been obtained at eight sites in the Owens Valley and twenty sites on the flanks
of Kilauea Volcano on the Island of Hawaii.  Roughness determinations will soon be
available from these sites.<BR>
<BR>
Collections of rock samples have been made for dating purposes at sites in Death Valley:
- we propose to date the exposure of fan surfaces using cosmogenic Be10  techniques
(Bierman et al., in press) and are doing this in conjunction with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#LLNL">LLNL</a>. 
  The purpose of these measurements is to establish the connection between surface age and roughness
on alluvial fans and thus to facilitate the use of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data to map relative age of
alluvial fans on a regional scale. We are currently participating in field work in
China with Tom Farr and will again be processing samples for the dating of fan surfaces
in the Kunlun area for which
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data has been obtained.<BR>
<BR>
In order to provide a theoretical/modeling basis for the individual and joint use
of different types of data we have started running backscatter simulations on our
Dec alpha computers.  Rough surfaces with the characteristics of field measured surfaces
are simulated and the backscatter calculated using a complete solution of Maxwell's equations
(Figure 3a).  We now also have the ability to calculate the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VNIR">VNIR</a> 
reflectance of these
same surfaces using a radiosity model to take into account multiple scattering interactions (Figure 3b).  The radiosity model is also used to simulate
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IR">IR</a> 
emission.
We can thus examine the response of surfaces of varying roughness at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VNIR">VNIR</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#IR">IR</a>, 
 and
radar wavelengths, and under differing illumination and viewing geometry's.  Our
preliminary backscatter simulations have shown that the parameters of surface power spectrum
(slope and offset) are inadequate and that the phase information contained in the
Fourier Transform is perhaps more important (Figure 3a).  This means that inversions
of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data for slope and offset of surface power spectra are highly nonunique unless
a third parameter, describing the degree of correlation of the phase of the surface,
is introduced.  This phase component really defines the shapes of elements of the
surface (for example, the cobbles on alluvial fans in Death Valley) and these elements
are the scattering elements of the surface.  What might be required is that an initial
assumption, based on field knowledge, defines the type of surface (shape/phase characteristic) after which a relation between slope and offset for that type of surface can
be used.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
We will be extending the efforts described above.  This will involve further development
of the integration and joint analysis of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#VNIR">VNIR</a>, 
 and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IR">IR</a> 
data to determine roughness
parameters and dielectric constant.  With regard to radar backscatter and surface roughness we will examine the response of radar to important aspects of real surfaces
that have hither to been ignored.  We will examine the ability to invert
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data
for these and other parameters.  We will expand our simulation and modeling effort
to include
   <a href="Acronyms.html#2-D">2-D</a> 
(surface) backscatter calculations to be made on a super computer in Hawaii.
We will be working with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#TIMS">TIMS</a>, 
 NS-001, and Landsat
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TM">TM</a> 
data in various
settings in Death Valley, Owens Valley, Hawaii, Australia and China.  These regions will be used to test the applications we develop.  We will determine age dates on
many geologic surfaces of interest in Death Valley, Owens Valley, and China and hence
better determine the relationship between age and backscatter in these regions.
We anticipate a minimum of three publications and three abstracts per year for the next
two years.<BR>
<BR>

Development of a Technique to Relate Eolian Roughness to Radar Backscatter Using Multiparameter

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
Date<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
To develop a technique to obtain values of aeolian roughness for geologic surfaces
from values of surface roughness determined from calibrated L- and C-band, like-
and cross-polarized, multiple incidence angle radar data from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a>. 
<BR>
<BR>
To define the optimal combination of radar parameters from which aeolian roughness
can be derived.<BR>
<BR>
To gain an understanding of the physical processes behind the empirical relationship.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Field work in preparation for SRL - two sites in Death Valley were instrumented with
micrometeorology masts in preparation for the SRL missions.  Field work was also
conducted with JPL's calibration team to select appropriate sites for corner reflectors,
transceivers, and receivers.<BR>
<BR>
During the first SRL flight, field work was carried out in Death Valley combined with
an education outreach program.  High school students and teachers from two schools
in Arizona assisted with the field work.  The field work included measuring surface
roughness by means of electronic distance meters, laser profilers, and a surface template.<BR>
<BR>
As part of the second flight, field work was conducted at the Lunar dry lake site
in Nye county, Nevada, August 18-20, 1994.  A single micrometeorology mast was deployed
and field observations conducted.<BR>
<BR>
Following both flights, several impact crater sites modified by wind activity were
identified in the survey data set.  These include the three pretargeted sites:  Zhamanshin
(Kazakhstan), Roter Kamm (Namibia), and Wolf Creek (Australia).<BR>
<BR>
Additional sites fortuitously imaged include: Oasis structure, Libya; BP structure,
Libya; Auronga, Chad; Amguid, Algeria; Henbury and Spider structures in Australia.<BR>
<BR>
A workshop was held at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ASU">ASU</a> 
in March 1995.  The three-day workshop included investigators
from Iowa State University, Univ. Calif./Davis,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#GSFC">GSFC</a>, 
 Israel, Denmark, and Russia.
The first day was dedicated to discussing progress on the analysis of the data covering the impact crater sites.  The second day was dedicated to discussion on
aeolian processes, and the third day was devoted to planning future work and publications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>

<ol type=a>
<li>Extend testing of the correlation between aerodynamic roughness
 and radar backscatter
to new areas including desert sites in the Middle East
 and vegetated sites in Denmark.<BR>
<BR>
<li>Continue experiments in wind tunnels on the role of roughness on 
the threshold
wind speed and flux of particles.<BR>
<BR>
<li>Generate an aerodynamic roughness map from SRL data
 for a specific region and test
the regional variation.<BR>
<BR>
<li>Explore applications of radar-derived aerodynamic roughness
 to GCMs and sensible
heat flux.<BR>
<BR>
<li>Blumberg will be teaching a university class
 in Radar Remote Sensing at Ben Gurion
University of the Negev, Israel.  The class will be using SRL data.<BR>
</ol>

Analysis of data<BR>
<BR>
Our research involves photogeology and quantitative analysis of returned signals (backscatter
cross sections). Hence, our analysis has included the generation of images in print
form for several scenes in Death Valley, Denmark, Israel, and the impact craters named above.  We have also conducted quantitative analysis on several of these
scenes.  This required writing software and modifying code provided by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>. 
  Future
work will require further modification of the code to generate aerodynamic maps,

   <a href="Acronyms.html#RMS">RMS</a> 
height and dielectric constant maps.  Some of this is in progress and we are at the stage
of debugging. In the future we will request more scenes of desert sites in the Middle
East, Mojave, and Africa.<BR>

<BR>
During the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
mission, the Chinese airborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
campaign
 was carried out simultaneously
at the Beijing test site. The truck-based scatterometer measurement
 was performed
on the various kinds of land types. Meanwhile, the soil moisture
 and crop phenologic parameters were observed. In the Inner Mongolia
 test site, 12 corner reflectors
were deployed on the surface and in various depths of the sand sheets
 for penetration
study. <BR>
<BR>
<li>Analysis of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data and ground-truth data <BR>
<BR>
In the Inner Mongolia test site, the responses of the deployed corner
 reflectors were
analyzed on the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
images. The penetration depths
 through the sand sheet
of multi-frequency radar signals were calculated and
 explained. At the Beijing test
site, the truck-based scatterometer measurement was
 used for calibration of Chinese airborne
CASSAR and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
survey images over the Beijing site. The
 cross-calibration is going
on. The relations between soil moisture, plant
 water content, and CASSAR images were analyzed. At the
 Zhaoqing site of south China,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data proved to be useful
for geological exploration in subtropic areas with
 heavy vegetation cover. At the
Shandong site of the east China, an impact crater was
 identified on the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

images.  At the Kunlun site of west China, a joint field
 investigation was carried out with

   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>. 
 Using the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data, nine summit craters and
 calderas with various shapes and
types of lava flows have been detected in the northeast of
 Aksayqin Lake, west Kunlun.
At the Yanchi site of north-central China, the first-step
 field investigation for the
Great Wall has been done based on the analysis for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data. <BR>
<BR>
<li>SIR-C Interferometry<BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a>

and Multispectral Optical Remote Sensing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
The objectives of this research have evolved over time based on experience with the
data, definition of available
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
sites, and the availability of resources.  The
following summarizes the main objectives of the research.<BR>
<BR>
To develop a better understanding of the current geomorphic expression of rock surfaces
by determining the relationship between lithological variability, weathering, soil
development, and vegetation distribution.<BR>
<BR>
To use variation in radar backscatter as a function of wavelength and polarization
to characterize the geometry, and indirectly the composition of rock units.<BR>
<BR>
To compare radar characterization with visible/infrared characterization of surface
materials.<BR>
<BR>
To map the character and distribution of lithological variation with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
by
preparing detailed lithologic maps of selected sites.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Until 31 March 1995, this research was supported with the University of Colorado.
Effective 10 April 1995, this
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
research was transferred to Analytical Imaging
and Geophysics LLC (AIG), Boulder, Colorado.<BR>
<BR>
A Final Report was submitted on 31 March 1995.  This report summarized significant
results for research conducted at the University of Colorado.  The research at CU
concentrated on compiling and analyzing optical and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data sets, learning better
how to use
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data for geologic mapping, and establishing the framework for geologic analysis
using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a>. 
  This included much of the preparatory work for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a>, 
 including acquiring

   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASA">NASA</a> 
Airborne data and preparing multiple optical and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data sets for analysis
and use with the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data.  Data analyzed included Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging
Spectrometer (AVIRIS), Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS), and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
airborne

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
(AIRSAR).  Small sample data sets for a site near the northern Grapevine Mountains, California/Nevada, were georeferenced and combined analysis was performed. The

   <a href="Acronyms.html#AVIRIS">AVIRIS</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TIMS">TIMS</a> 
data provided detailed lithologic information in the form of mineral
maps and color composite images.  The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data were processed to color composite
images and a small perturbation model was also used to extract surface roughness values
from the data.  Several sessions of field mapping and verification were conducted.
Algorithms were developed that could be applied to the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data.  Preliminary
processing of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
data from the Death Valley Supersite included initial registration of
X-SAR to the fully polarimetric
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data, generation of gray scale and three frequency
color composite images, and trial inversion of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data to surface roughness.  Two field checks of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
processing results were conducted in January and March
1995.  Significant results are summarized below.<BR>
<BR>
-Research at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIG">AIG</a> 
from 10 April 1995 to present has concentrated on utilizing the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 

and X-SAR data from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
for geologic mapping.  Six two-month research
phases have been completed.<BR>
<BR>
-Research during Phase I (10 April to 31 May 1995) of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIG">AIG</a> 
contract concentrated
on analysis of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data for one area near Stovepipe Wells, California, the
&quot;Kit Fox Hills&quot; area and two areas at the north end of Death Valley National Park.

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR data from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#DT">DT</a> 
120.30 were processed to produce image-maps of these
sites as the basis for detailed lithologic mapping and field investigations.  Processing
included extraction of compressed data products from 8 mm tapes, synthesis of individual frequency and polarization images for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data, interactive viewing and analysis
of individual detected images and color composites, and generation of hard-copy images
for visual analysis. 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR data were co-registered using ground control points (GCPs) and color composite images were made utilizing the three frequencies.
JPL
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data were available for two of the above sites, the Kit Fox Hills area
and one of the northern Death Valley National Park sites.  Specific frequencies and
polarizations were also synthesized for these data and visual comparisons made to the
SRL-1
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data.  Both
   <a href="Acronyms.html#LANDSAT">LANDSAT</a> 
Thematic Mapper (TM) and Thermal Infrared Multispectral
Scanner (TIMS) data were available for the one northern Death Valley National Park site.  These were co-registered to the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data and used for combined
analysis.  Limited field reconnaissance was conducted for all sites during April
1995 in conjunction with a JPL-sponsored coordination meeting with other
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
investigators
conducting work at the Death Valley Supersite.<BR>
<BR>
-Research during Phase II (1 June - 31 July 1995) of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIG">AIG</a> 
contract concentrated
primarily on one area in Death Valley National Park.  For Death Valley,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and
X-SAR data from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#DT">DT</a> 
120.30 were processed to produce image-maps of these sites
as the basis for detailed lithologic mapping and field investigations.  The key results are
summarized in the significant results section below; additional results are described
in a manuscript submitted to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TGARS">TGARS</a>. 
  Processing was a continuation of work conducted
during Phase I and included synthesis of individual frequency and polarization images
for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data, interactive viewing and analysis of individual detected images and
color composites, and generation of hard-copy images for visual analysis.  A small
perturbation model was used to calculate the geophysical parameters &quot;RMS surface roughness&quot;
and &quot;Fractal Dimension.&quot;
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR data geometric corrections were refined
using additional ground control points (GCPs).  Images were coregistered with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPOT">SPOT</a>, 


   <a href="Acronyms.html#TM">TM</a>, 
 and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TIMS">TIMS</a> 
and map located (geo-located).  The combined data sets were used for integrated
analysis.<BR>
<BR>
Phase III (1 August - 30 September 1995) concentrated on one area in the Bighorn Basin,
Wyoming.  Data from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#DT">DT</a> 
51.31 were processed and analyzed to produce image maps
of portions of the Bighorn Basin near Greybull, Wyoming, as the basis for detailed
lithologic mapping and field investigations.  Processing and analysis included reading
of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data from distribution tape, synthesis of individual frequency and
polarization images for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data, interactive viewing and analysis of individual
detected images and color composites, and generation of hard-copy images for visual analysis.
The X-SAR data were registered to the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data using 20 manually-selected GCPs,
Delaunay Triangulation warping, and nearest neighbor resampling.  Both
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and
X-SAR data were further registered to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#LANDSAT">LANDSAT</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#TM">TM</a> 
images using 50 GCPs, Delaunay Triangulation,
and nearest neighbor resampling.  The images were used for digital analysis and manual
interpretation followed by field reconnaissance during September 1995.<BR>
<BR>
Phase IV (1 October - 30 November 1995) research concentrated on processing and analysis
for a portion of the Death Valley
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
Supersite. Survey data from both the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 

and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> 
sets were used to construct a mosaic covering the Death Valley
Supersite.  The purpose of this mosaic was to provide a regional overview of the site
as an aid to structural interpretation, and to assist in selection, processing, and
archiving of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data sets for precision processing.  Two precision
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

data sets were also processed and analyzed to produce image maps of portions of the
Death Valley Supersite during the Phase IV effort.  The effort using these products
during this phase consisted of: selection of the data sets, reading of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

data from distribution tapes, synthesis of individual frequency and polarization images
for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data, interactive viewing and analysis of individual detected images and
color composites, and generation of hard-copy images for visual analysis.  Both sets
of X-SAR data (SRL-1) and (SRL-2) were registered to the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data, and color-composite
images were made for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
data covering the same area.  The objective
of this work was to allow comparison of data from the two missions and assess the
effect of specific radar acquisition parameters on the geologic information content of the imagery.
Four
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AVIRIS">AVIRIS</a> 
scenes covering a subarea within the Death Valley Supersite were calibrated
to reflectance using the ATREM atmospheric model during Phase IV.  The data quality was assessed by interactive viewing, and preliminary analysis of individual
scenes was started.  Band 30 (0.66 mm) of all 4 scenes were map-referenced to allow
future production of standard image maps from the data.<BR>
<BR>
-Research conducted during Phase V was primarily a continuation of the Phase IV research
and concentrated on processing and analysis of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AVIRIS">AVIRIS</a> 
data for portions
of the Death Valley
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
Supersite.  The Survey data mosaic constructed during Phase IV was printed at 1:250,000 scale and used to identify areas for further analysis.
The precision
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data sets processed during Phase IV were map-referenced
during Phase V to produce high resolution image maps for comparison and combined
processing with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AVIRIS">AVIRIS</a> 
data.  1994
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AVIRIS">AVIRIS</a> 
data processed during Phase IV were map-registered
during Phase V and analysis products used to produce thematic image maps for comparison
to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
results.  1995
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AVIRIS">AVIRIS</a> 
data for the northern Death Valley site were calibrated to reflectance using the ATREM atmospheric model, the data quality was assessed
by interactive viewing, and mineral maps were made for sites previously analyzed
using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#LANDSAT">LANDSAT</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#TM">TM</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a>. 
<BR>
<BR>
Phase VI research consisted of work at a variety of sites.  Survey data from both
the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> 
sets were used to construct a mosaic covering the Bighorn
Basin, Wyoming Site.  The purpose of this mosaic was to provide a regional overview
of the site as an aid to structural interpretation, and to assist in selection, processing,
and archiving of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data sets for precision processing. 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR
data were co-registered for a site in northern Sonora, Mexico, and multifrequency-multipolarization analysis was conducted.  A digital elevation model derived by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
from

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data using interferometric methods was analyzed for a site at the southern
end of Death Valley (the Owlshead Mtns.).  The

<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Significant results of the research conducted under
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
Contract 958456 at the University
of Colorado include:<BR>
<BR>
Successful use of combined optical/SAR data to provide new insights for geologic mapping,
particularly of alluvial materials.  Mapping of selected locations within the Death
Valley
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
Supersite.<BR>
<BR>
Extraction of quantitative surface roughness using both
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
to establish
that under correct conditions  (low topographic relief, composition and weathering
characteristics closely linked, little surface moisture, and minimal vegetation cover), close associations do exist between lithology and fan roughness (e.g., hydrothermal
alteration of granitic material produced smoother fan that fan derived from unaltered
granite).<BR>
<BR>
Demonstrated, that in most cases, however, fan morphology and lithology are more closely
related to tectonics and fan age rather than directly to bedrock composition.<BR>

<BR>
Processing and analysis of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data for several sites in Death Valley National
Park, a regional study in the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, and study of one site in Sonora,
Mexico, indicate that the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data from both
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
are of high quality and useful for geologic mapping. Several test sites were analyzed in detail and field
reconnaissance verifies image processing and analysis results.<BR>
<BR>
Efforts towards
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
registration indicate that this is basically a non-issue
other than the time and effort involved to perform the picking of ground control
points.  The two
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
datasets can be co-registered to acceptable error limits using
standard image-to-image registration procedures available in many commercial remote sensing
packages. Registration of images synthesized from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
MLC and the X-SAR
   <a href="Acronyms.html#MLD">MLD</a> 

standard products is straightforward using ground control points. Registration of
slant-range images synthesized from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SLC">SLC</a> 
data is not as easy and errors are larger.
It would be better if future multifrequency

missions would deliver inherently
co-registered data sets to investigators.<BR>
<BR>
Registration of optical data sets to the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data is more difficult than coregistration
of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data, but still relatively easy.  Standard image processing systems can be
successfully used to perform the registrations. Because of the difference in the
physics, however (active vs passive), and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
artifacts such as layover and foreshortening
and radar shadow, it is not possible to achieve the low
   <a href="Acronyms.html#RMS">RMS</a> 
errors possible between

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data sets. Registration for digital analysis requires significantly more ground
control points to achieve the desired registration accuracy.<BR>
<BR>
Standard image processing procedures available in many commercial remote sensing packages
can be used effectively to extract useful geologic information from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

data.  Simple color composites provided sufficient detail to make predictions that require only limited field verification.  Some of the color distinctions required
for interpretation are very subtle.  Radar data simply do not make very colorful
images for many geologic environments.  This indicates that significant portions
of the information are present in grayscale images of individual bands, which could just as well
be used for the roughness interpretations.<BR>
<BR>
Combined SAR/Optical data sets provide the best way to fully analyze the geology using
remote sensing data sets.  For alluvial fans in Death Valley,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TM">TM</a> 
data are useful
for providing a general overview of the geology.  It does not adequately delineate
the fans. 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TIMS">TIMS</a> 
data are particularly well suited to determining composition of the fans
because of their ability to directly detect silica.  In one case two areas were effectively
separated corresponding to carbonates and silica.  Fans in the carbonate area, however, were not well separated using only the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TIMS">TIMS</a> 
data.  The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data were
not able to separate the two compositions.  They added significantly to the overall
analysis, however, because they were able to discriminate the smooth fans with the
same compositions (both quartzite and carbonate).  The combination of these three data
sets provides powerful tools for lithologic mapping.  The results of this research
show that the combination of optical remote sensing and radar data provides distinct
advantages for geologic mapping, particularly of alluvial materials. Insights obtained
during this research are being used to develop a model explaining the distribution
of fans in the northern end of Death Valley and their relationships to bedrock lithology
and tectonics.<BR>
<BR>
Standard multispectral image processing procedures available in commercially available
image processing systems were effective in extracting useful geologic information
from combined SAR/Optical data sets.  Simple color composites provided a wealth of
detail for visual interpretation and mapping.  Digital analysis and extraction of extended
spectral signatures using &quot;hyperspectral&quot; analysis procedures were more effective
in characterizing lithologic variability than the multispectral processing techniques.
A procedure typically used for analysis of imaging spectrometer data consisting of
a Maximum Noise Fraction (MNF) rotation and &quot;Pixel Purity Index (PPI)&quot; determination,
followed by visualization using n-Dimensional scatterplots was effective in defining
lithologic endmembers for subsequent classification and mapping.  These results were
also useful in assigning physical basis to colors presented on the color composites
generated using multispectral methods.<BR>
<BR>
In combination, these data sets provide complementary information that builds a picture
of the geology;

Paleodrainages of the Sahara, SIR-C<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Use
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data in a synoptic mode with other remotely sensed data, field, and
cartographic data to map relic Cenozoic drainage systems across the Sahara from the
Red Sea Hills, Egypt, to the Chad Basin and Atlantic Ocean.<BR>
<BR>
Demonstrate applicability of SIR data, used with Landsat,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPOT">SPOT</a> 
and high-altitude photographic
data, as a new, cost-effective remote geophysical tool for exploration geology.<BR>
<BR>
Produce a major report on the distribution of paleodrainages in the Sahara, their
relations to the basic tectonic elements of North Africa (basins and swells), and
their economic potential.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
CDs containing relevant Sahara &quot;Data Takes&quot; have now been received (two key CDs arrived
as recently as mid-September '95).  Most CDs containing survey data in areas of interest
have been distributed to our Co-I's.  A list of some 50 scenes we have selected for special processing has been submitted to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>, 
 primarily for sites in eastern
Libya, northern Sudan, and the Sinai Peninsula, where several promising examples
of sand-buried paleodrainage patterns are revealed by the L-band radar.  We estimate
that our total request for special processing will be about 250 scenes, when all of the inputs
are received from our foreign Co-I's.<BR>
<BR>
We have completed preliminary review of all the Saharan swaths received by the Paleodrainage
Team (to Sept. '95).  This was done on the PI's Pentium computer system which allowed
the production of enhanced and scaled survey images at the 1:500,000-scale, which were then registered to 1:500,000-scale Tactical Plot charts of North Africa,
provided to us by the U.S. Army Topographic Engineering Center, Ft. Belvoir, VA.
These charts show all of the visible (surface) drainage systems located by conventional
mapping system.  By comparing them with the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
radar images, because of the ability
of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
to image into the shallow subsurface in sand covered areas, we are able
to delineate previously unrecognized watercourses.  Our ultimate objective is to
produce a map at the largest practical scale (1:2,000,000?) showing the newly found drainages
against a background of those already mapped.  This map is expected to have broad
practical applications for water resources, mineral exploration, and land use in
several parts of North Africa.  This effort will also make use of the astronaut photography
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
data.  Extensive collaboration has taken place over the past eighteen months
with our foreign Co-I's and Collaborators, both by fax, e-mail, and in person before,
during and after the Uberlingen meeting.<BR>
<BR>
(1)  Data analysis plans and long range plans were discussed and an invitation was
extended to our group to participate in field work in the Sahara with the newly funded
German desert team under the direction of Dr. Stefan Kroepelin, University of Cologne, Germany.  New vehicles, equipment, base camp buildings, etc. are currently being
assembled as part of this new project, entitled &quot;Environmental and Cultural Change
in Arid Africa.&quot;  We intend to follow up on this opportunity at the earliest possible
time (probably Oct./Nov. '96).<BR>
<BR>
(2)  Also in Germany, Dr. Joachim Pachur, Free University of Berlin has agreed to
take the lead in investigating the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
coverage of the Wadi Kufra area in southeast
Libya.  We reported preliminary work on this river system at the Spring
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AGU">AGU</a> 
Meeting
in Baltimore.  A graduate student of Prof. Pachur (Mr. Frank Rottinger, who attended the
Uberlingen Meeting) who will do his Ph.D. on newly defined paleoriver systems in
the southern Sahara will be coming to our facility in Flagstaff this fall to begin
work with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data.  Both German groups have access to Libya whereas we do not and are
happy to defer to them.<BR>
<BR>
(3)  Data analysis planning with the French group at the University of Marseilles
also took place after the Uberlingen meeting and we had preliminary discussions about
their possible return to northeastern Chad for various Quaternary studies and visits
to key paleodrainage localities that are also presently out of reach of U.S. investigators
for political reasons.<BR>
<BR>
(4)  Bahay Issawi, former Director of the Egyptian Geological Survey, spent nine days
at the Sedona office of the P.I. and also visited the USGS offices in Flagstaff.
This time was spent relating the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data to regional geology of Egypt and preparing
the first draft of the paper submitted to the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IEEE">IEEE</a> 
Special Issue and demonstrating
various data analysis techniques for use in Egypt.  Meetings were also held in Flagstaff
with a representative of the Saudi Arabian
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
Paleodrainage Experiment.  Plans
for a special session on imaging radar results in Egypt were first formulated.  During
the time period we also spent much time revising the requirements for our experiment
in order to obtain the best mission plan for possible Sahara coverage consistent
with the needs of other experiments for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a>. 
  The overall plan was presented to all interested
geology investigators at the June 19, '94 Team Meeting at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>. 
<BR>
<BR>
(5)  Carol Breed and the P.I. attended the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
launch (at our own expense) where
we had the opportunity to discuss the merits of SIR with Dr. John Hansen, Director
of Research at the Topographic Engineering Center, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Ft. Belvoir, VA.  This led to further discussions, cartographic support, and a minor amount
of funding for a demonstration project by Carol Breed for the purpose of finding
desert water resources.  We also helped to prepare after the mission several PIO
captions (particularly SafSaf, Egypt) for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>.

Astronaut Crew (May 4-5) at our facility in Flagstaff on the
objectives of the Paleodrainage experiment and desert landforms in general.  This
was followed by an overnight field trip to the Painted Desert east of Flagstaff where
they gained visual experience with sand-filled river channels, wind erosion features,
sand sheets and sand dunes.  Later in the year (Sept. 23), we met with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
astronaut
Linda Godwin in Flagstaff to discuss preliminary results of the first flight and
to attend her lecture at Northern Arizona University where our SIR work was amply referenced.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
As explained above, we anticipate needing an additional 150 to 200 specially processed
segments of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data, in order to do justice to the data and to take advantage
of the field expertise of our foreign Co-I's and Collaborators.  This requirement
stems from the areal scope of the Saharan Paleodrainage Investigation, which covers an area
roughly equivalent to that of the USA.<BR>
<BR>
Prepare a synoptic map (as described above) of the newly defined
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
paleodrainages
of North Africa.<BR>
<BR>
Participate in the special conference on North African radar applications as part
of the EGSMA Centennial, and submit paper.<BR>
<BR>
Participate in a field campaign with the newly-formed German desert group (with direction
of S. Kroepelin).  Emphasis will be on radar response studies at Safsaf (in cooperation
with P.I. G.G. Schaber) and the applications of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data to hydrological and archaeological prospecting.  One of the key German radar experts has stated, during
training sessions for desert researchers, that the paleodrainage results were the
most significant of the entire mission.  We expect numerous publications to come
from this work, both in European and U.S. journals.<BR>
<BR>
We also anticipate close cooperation and multiple publications with our numerous French
colleagues.  These will not necessarily be limited to paleodrainage features, but
will also include studies of duricrusts (calcrete, gypcrete, ferricrete), and landscape evolution as a function of the interplay between running water and wind driven by
climate change in the Sahara.<BR>

Eruptive Styles Of Basaltic Shield Volcanoes From Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C)
and X-SAR Data<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
To provide a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of volcanic materials
on classic examples of balsaltic shield volcanoes in Hawaii, Reunion Island (Indian
Ocean) and Galapagos (Eastern Pacific).<BR>
<BR>
Interpret the preserved eruptive history of each volcano, draw contrasts between each
test site in terms of the role of the tectonic setting on basaltic volcanism, and
make inferences about the internal structure of the volcano and its magma chamber.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Since the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
mission (October 1994), we have recognized the importance of the repeat-orbit
phase of the mission for conducting new volcanological research with interferometric
radar data.  Over the last eight months we have therefore undertaken a vigorous program to develop our own interferometric
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
processing scheme at the University
of Hawaii through a close collaboration with Howard Zebker and Paul Rosen at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>. 

The processing scheme that we have developed is based on a program in use at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>, 

and on the mathematics outlined by Curlander (1991).  From raw
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data we can now construct
images, co-register repeat-pass images, produce interferograms between images, unwrap
interferogram phase, and minimize baseline uncertainties.  We have performed the mapping from interferometric phase to topography, and calibrated the topography to
produce digital elevation models.  Our ultimate processing goal, which we expect
to reach by the end of 1995, is to use repeat-pass interferometry to produce quantitative
phase correlation maps in order to describe surface change on volcanoes such as Kliuchevskoi
(Kamchatka).  Our interferometry work in Hawaii mirrors studies conducted at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>, 

and we have collaborated on one of their papers (Zebker et al., submitted to Science) on the surface changes due to the emplacement of new lava flows at Kilauea volcano
during
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
(see Fig. 1).<BR>
<BR>
For test data we have worked with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data for our &quot;Super Site&quot; on Isabela Island
(Galapagos).  Figs. 2 and 3 demonstrate our current capabilities to perform this
interferometry work, which allows us to go from the raw data to a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a>. 
  This
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 

is being used to study the relationship between lava flow widths and slopes (a good indicator
of changing lava flow rheology) as well as test our phase unwrapping algorithms for

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
via a comparison with the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TOPSAR">TOPSAR</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 
that was obtained as part of the 1993
South America deployment of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASA">NASA</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#DC-8">DC-8</a> 
aircraft.  As our
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
investigations advance
from algorithm development to scientific application, we shall concentrate on creating
images and DEMs for Kliuchevskoi, Taal (Philippines), the Virunga Chain (Zaire),
and Piton dela Fournaise (Reunion Island), and on deformation mapping of Kilauea and Kliuchevskoi.
For the Galapagos, by comparing DEMs from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data with pre- and post-eruption

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPOT">SPOT</a> 
images (together with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TOPSAR">TOPSAR</a> 
results), we will investigate topographic control of lava flows.<BR>
<BR>
As a parallel activity, we expect to be able to demonstrate within a few months a
fully-functional
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
processing scheme together with full satellite downlink capabilities
(using our own X-band ground station).  With the capability to process
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data,
and with the ability also to downlink ERS and JERS data, we will be in a good position
to support any future
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASA">NASA</a> 
radar missions, including any
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-3">SRL-3</a> 
or TOPSAT mission.
This university-based capability should be particularly useful as
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASA">NASA</a> 
attempts
to find low-cost methods for radar data reception and processing in order to fly these future
missions.<BR>
<BR>
We have obtained 11 data takes over Hawaii (including Mauna Loa, Kilauea and Haleakala
-- all places where we have on-going research), and 31 data takes over other volcanoes.
As part of this investigation, a total of 27 interferometric data sets have also been obtained or are requested, making 69 data requests in all.  Currently, we have
research underway using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data to investigate the relationship between extensional
tectonism and volcanism at Erta Ale (Ethiopia), the structure of Taal caldera and
the regional distribution of volcanic land forms in the Virunga volcanic chain.  The
Virunga chain includes Nyamuragira and Nyiragongo volcanoes, and gives us the opportunity
to study the radar scattering properties, the noise floor of the radar data, and
the radar system calibration in an area where the distribution of flow types and vegetation
is poorly known, thereby building on our experience with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data at Kilauea.
We have
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data for the Virunga Chain that were obtained at three different pulse
bandwidths and two look-directions, and have on order a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPOT">SPOT</a> 
multispectral image for
the same area.  In addition to describing the volcanology of this area, we will also
study the effects of different pulse bandwidths for mapping the numerous cinder cones
and lava flows in this rarely studied area.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
As we work through the radar interferometry data sets, we are starting to see some
fascinating new things.  Our paper (Zebker et al., submitted to <CITE>Science</CITE>
) shows for the first time how an orbital radar can be used to measure the daily change
in area of new lava flows on Kilauea volcano, Hawaii.  Such data provide new insights
into the eruption characteristics of the volcano, and the growth of lava flow fields.  By approximating the average thickness of the flow to 50 cm, we have estimated
an average effusion rate of ~2 cubic meters per second over the four-day observation
period.  Furthermore, the derivation of the phase correlation maps (needed to detect
new lava flow surfaces) also revealed some unexpected phenomena that we believe are
due to atmospheric moisture.  This was totally unexpected, and we plan to process
additional interferometry pairs as fast as we can in order to search similar phenomena
in different climatic settings.<BR>
<BR>
As a part of our efforts to educate the volcanology community on the value of orbital
radars, and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
in particular, we have published a general review (in <CITE>Earth Observation Quarterly</CITE>
) of radar interferometry in volcanology, and have a review article in press in <CITE>IEEE Trans. Geosci. Rem. Sen.</CITE>
The P.I. has also served on the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASA">NASA</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#NRC">NRC</a> 
Review Panel (John McElroy, Chair) advocating
a new
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASA">NASA</a> 
interferometric radar mission.  Invited papers on the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
results have
been given at the 1994 GSA meeting (Seattle) and the 1995 IUGG General Assembly (Boulder, CO).  Another review will be given at the All-Union special session on &quot;Radar
Interferometry&quot; at the Fall 1995
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AGU">AGU</a> 
meeting in San Francisco.<BR>
<BR>
Surface change at Kliuchevskoi volcano, Kamchatka, during the October 1994 eruption.
As luck would have it, there was a major explosive eruption of Kliuchevskoi volcano
five hours after the launch of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a>. 
  While most of the explosive activity took
place during the early parts of the mission, pyroclastic flows and mudflows were reported
during the repeat-orbit phase of the mission between October 7th - 10th.  We are
currently processing these interferometric data to search for surface change.  If
we find any, we will place these results into the general context of the eruption with the
aid of reports made by other volcanologists on the ground and images taken by the

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
crew during the mission.  This work is in an early phase, but will be submitted
to Bulletin Volcanology either as a complete study, or as a component of a paper on the
use of radar-derived digital elevation models and surface change detection.<BR>
<BR>
For our Galapagos Super Site, we have used the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data to help with the mapping
of Fernandina volcano, particularly in determining flow types.  The goal of this
project is to determine the long-term magma production rates and eruption patterns
of the volcano.  This is being done by mapping the distribution of flows of various relative
ages, mapping the distribution of eruptive vents, and by calculating the volumes
of the flows of these various ages.  Calculating the volumes requires knowledge of
the flow thicknesses, and this is where we are using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TOPSAR">TOPSAR</a> 
data.  So far only the volumes
of the youngest flows have been determined, and they total 25.5 cubic kilometers.
They have been preferentially erupted from the upper and lower SE and NW flanks.
One result of having the good topography is that it has highlighted the fact that there are
essentially no eruptive vents on the steeper slopes, which no doubt reflects some
aspect of the stress field within the volcanic edifice.  This work is being prepared
for publication in the special
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
issue of <CITE>J. Geophysical Research</CITE>
.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Our plans for the next two years are heavily focused on the analysis of the interferometry
data, both for the detection of surface change and atmospheric effects (i.e., analysis
of the phase correlation data) and on the derivation and analysis of the digital elevation models that we will produce.  We have a specific set of priorities and
collaborations planned for these studies and intend that each of these investigations
will result in a manuscript being submitted for publication:<BR>
<BR>
Kliuchevksoi volcano, Kamchatka (SRL-2 data takes 121.10, 137.10, 153.10 and 169.20,
all of which are in-hand).  We wish to study the later parts of the eruption, searching
for evidence of moving pyroclastic flows, mudflows, and the waning phases of the
eruption plume.  Quantitative decorrelation maps will be produced from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
data
collected on October 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th, 1994 to show how the flows may have
moved on a daily basis.  Through this study we hope to learn more about the emplacement
of these flows -- we expect to see changes not only at the leading edge but also in the
up-slope parts of the flow if the flow is a mudflow that remained fluid during to
the release of melt water from the snow-capped peak of the volcano, as suggested
from our inspection of the accompanying hand-held photography obtained by the crew of STS-68.<BR>
<BR>
Morphology and structure of the Virunga volcanic chain, Africa (SRL-2 data takes 154.90
and 170.90).  These data encompass virtually the entire Virunga volcanic field, including
the recently active Nyiragongo volcano of Zaire.  Parts of Nyamuragira volcano lie within the interferometry pair, and all parts of the volcano were imaged as part
of the multilook data (SRL-1
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DT">DT</a> 
58.60, 171.10, SRL-258.61 and 154.90).  We plan to
produce a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 
for the eastern area of the Virunga volcanic field, which includes
the Karisoke Research Center -- home of the endangered mountain gorillas -- and to use this

   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 
to study the distribution of the maar volcanoes in this area as a function of
elevation.  Here we wish to use the elevation data to help us remotely discriminate
between cinder cones (&quot;dry&quot; eruptions at relatively high elevations) and maar cones (&quot;wet&quot;
eruptions at lower elevations) close to nearby Lake Kivu; there are many dozens of
cones surrounding the main volcanoes and we hope to deduce some structural aspects
of this mono-genetic volcanic field through a study of cone volume and size of the summit
craters.  In addition, there are some unusually thick lava flows on some of the volcanoes
that can be seen in the multilook data; we want to measure their slopes on the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 
to help with rheological studies of flows.  Nyiragongo and Nyamuragira are characterized
by extremely fluid lava flows that can travel long distances very quickly, posing
an extreme hazard for nearby populated areas, such as Goma (and the surrounding Rwandan refugee camps).  Also, the formation of Lake Kivu has heightened the risk of
explosive activity due to magma/groundwater interactions.  Although volcanic hazards
mitigation is largely beyond the scope of this study,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data can provide the
basis for geologic maps of the region, particularly in otherwise accessible areas.  This
study will provide a regional context for field observations that can be used by
other investigators to further understand the past behavior and future risks in this
area.<BR>
<BR>
Structure of Taal volcano (SRL-2 data takes 126.30, 142.30, and 158.30 all of which
have already been requested).  In collaboration with Dr. Stephen Self (Univ. Hawaii)
and Dr. R. Punongbayan (Philippine Volcano Observatory), we plan to create a digital
elevation model of Taal volcano in order to investigate the structure of southwestern
Luzon island, Philippines.  Detailed knowledge of the topography will greatly aid
our analysis of the erosional characteristics of the ignimbrite sheets that dominate
the area surrounding Taal caldera.  Some areas of deeply eroded (steep slopes?) and other
areas of relatively shallow valleys (lower slopes?) can be identified in individual

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
images.  Our main study area is the Taal ignimbrite sheet north of the caldera,
which is extremely difficult to map on the ground due to dense vegetation and the lack
of roads.<BR>
<BR>
Piton de la Fournaise, Reunion Island was our third original
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
target.
During the last 3 months, we have been discussing with Jean-Francois Lenat (Center
for Volcanology Research, Clermont Ferrand, France) the possibility of detecting
changes in the large-scale morphology of the volcano between 1990 (when he produced a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 
of
the volcano using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPOT">SPOT</a> 
stereo data) and 1994 (the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
interferometry pair from
Data Takes 146.60 and 162.60, both already requested).  Because this volcano erupts
almost every year, there is a good possibility that we will be able to detect differences
in the volume of the summit crater and/or flank flows.  This will also be a valuable
test for comparing DEMs produced from photogrammetric data with DEMs derived via
interferometry methods.<BR>
<BR>
We have had several requests for producing digital elevation models of other volcanoes,
partly in support of our
   <a href="Acronyms.html#EOS">EOS</a> 
interdisciplinary investigation, and partly to assist
our colleagues in the international volcanology community.  Mt. Etna (SRL-2 data
takes 141.10 and 157.10 both requested) is a key area of interest for Dave Pieri and Vince
Realmuto (both at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>) 
 and Dave Rothery, John Murray and Bill McGuire (all in England).
Detailed knowledge of the topography of Etna is required for rheological studies of the numerous lava flows on the flanks, as well as for sulfur dioxide retrievals
using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TIMS">TIMS</a> 
data.  Ray Punongbayan is very interested in the production of a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 
of
Pinatubo (SRL-2 data takes 126.30, 142.30, and 158.30) because of the continuing
hazards due to lahars on this volcano.  Vesuvius (DT 130.40, 146.40, and 162.40 all requested)
is a high priority for Italian and German members of the X-SAR Team, since they wish
us to produce a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 
using our code that can then be compared to their result.  In
addition, we already have a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TOPSAR">TOPSAR</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 
for Vesuvius, and will take this opportunity
to compare our
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
topographic map with these aircraft measurements.<BR>

data analyses in Campania Test Site<BR>
<br><br>
<strong>OBJECTIVES</strong>
<BR>
<br>
The overall objective of this investigation is the evaluation of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data
collected over the Campania test site in geological analyses.<BR>
<BR>
Specific objectives include the following:<BR>
<BR>
To determine effective procedures to process
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data to extract information useful
in geological analyses, in particular lithology mapping;<BR>
To evaluate the relative utility of multifrequency quad-pol
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data in morpho-structural
analyses.<BR>
<BR>
In particular a processing algorithm based on a covariance matrix approach, which
permits us to take advantage of the polarization agility of dual-channel multifrequency

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a>, 
 has been developed. Unfortunately only one quad-pol single-look image was available so a great amount of work was carried out on dual-pol data which do not allow a
complete electromagnetic characterization of targets.<BR>
<BR>
<br>

<strong>PROGRESS</strong>
<P>The Picentini Mountains<P>
The Picentini mountains have been selected because of their very articulated morphology
and structure. The area is characterized by many geological formations and structural
typologies (faults, overthrusts, klippens, and tectonic windows). The geological
analysis of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images has been carried out locally (the selected area does not exceed
400 km<sup>2</sup>) 
so, for example, structural trends have not been considered. The study has been
focused on both geological details (e.g., the analysis of the limit between limestone
and dolomite of the Stella mountain) and structural lineament identification.<BR>

<P>The Phlegrean Fields<P>
The Phlaegrean Fields area offers the opportunity to study a morphology characterized
by several crateric rims having different ages and histories. For this area
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

data have been integrated by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a>

The Somma-Vesuvius complex<P>
Vesuvius a very interesting test site, which was observed during a number of spaceborne
and airborne remote sensing missions. For that reason we are able to compare the
results obtained using

data with those obtained using other

</ul>

Methodology<BR>
<BR>
Color and B/W images have been generated from both dual-pol (11x) and quad-pol (16x)
L- and C-band data takes and from fixed polarization X-band acquisitions respectively.<BR>
<BR>
Dual-pol data color images have been obtained by combining the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#HV">HV</a> 
and SPAN information
on three (Red, Green and Blue) 8-bit color planes. That combination is especially
helpful in the L-band where the cross-polarized return is mainly contributed by the high depolarization effect of dense vegetation. In such a way the green appearance
of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HV">HV</a> 
return facilitates the geologist to detect some variations in the lithology.<BR>
<BR>
A more sophisticated processing has been developed and applied to quad-pol data takes.
First and second order statistics of co-polarized and cross-polarized measurements
can be easily extracted from scattering matrix or Stokes scattering operator and
used to build a covariance matrix. If single-look data are available these statistics can
be computed assuming both a temporal average of values (single look) or assuming
a spatial average of values (multi look), the latter being less noisy. If HV=VH,
the covariance matrix (now 3x3) can be decomposed, according to Cloude, Van Zyl, and Castellano,
in the sum of three scattering mechanisms (the product of each eigenvector for its
transpose with opposite phase) weighted by the respective eigenvalues. Even though
the basis of such a decomposition is rotating in the target space for different targets
(when the eigenvalues change the eigenvectors rotate in a plane), it can be shown
that, if at a first approximation we assume a fixed basis of the decomposition, the
eigenvalues will differentiate among targets with a different  scattering behavior. In
addition three eigenvalues (normalized or not) can be represented on three color
planes for visual photo-interpretation.<BR>
<br>
Geology<P>
The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
images, generated as above mentioned, have been analyzed by using
photo-interpretation techniques and integrated with images of comparable spatial
resolution acquired by other sensors (ERS-1 ascending, descending and roll-tilt mode,

   <a href="Acronyms.html#JERS-1">JERS-1</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a>) 
. The results have been compared and/or integrated with geological sheets
and when possible with aerial photos, geological sheets and field checks.<BR>
<BR>
Brightness, color, texture, shading and pattern information is used for discriminating
among geological features and lithologies. Foreshortening/layover effects, in the
case of the Picentini mounts and of the Phlaegrean Fields, have been verified by
comparing
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images and geological cartographic profiles.<BR>
<BR>
<br>


<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<P></strong>
<P>Data Processing<P>
Tables 1 (L-band) and 2 (C-band) show some experimental results obtained by decomposing
the normalized covariance matrices computed over 9 sample windows (11x11 pixels).
Each target (Vesuvius cone, 1944 lava flow, pine forest and sea) has been selected
at most twice in order to check about the effects of slight different looking directions
and/or incidence angles. Sea samples have been extracted from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
images since
on these data the incidence angle ranges from 23&#176;  to about 58&#176;.<BR>
<BR>


For each sample have been computed the ratio HH/VV (second column), the ratio VV/HH
(third column), the third eigenvalue (fourth column), the module (fifth column) and
phase (sixth column) of correlation coefficient between co-polarized channels, the
first (seventh column) and second (eighth column) normalized eigenvalues. The target &quot;entropy&quot;,
here defined as the sum of the normalized eigenvalues, is reported in the last column.<BR>
<BR>


As can be noted, if the target is constituted by sand/ash as in the case of the Vesuvius
cone, the first eigenvalue represents more than the 70% and 80% of target entropy
for L-band and C-band respectively. These values suggest that, also for L-band scattering, the surface effect dominates the volumetric effect. A comparison made with P-band

   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data shows a probably more consistent volumetric scattering at these frequencies
(a value of 60% is typical on the Vesuvius cone). 
The analysis of 
<img src="/symbols/lambda.gif" alt="[Lambda]"><sub>3</sub>
(h in the Tables) 
confirms these remarks; the L-band (5-6 %) and C-band (12-13%) values
show clearly, for the latter, a higher depolarization effect suggesting that the
pyroclastic products of the Vesuvius cone are rougher at a centimeter scale than
at a decimeter scale.<BR>
<BR>


For concerns of the 1944 lava flows, the depolarization effect increases sensibly
with respect to the cone in the L-band as well as the C-band. The first eigenvalue
is now only 50-55% of target entropy while the second and third eigenvalues reach
about the 20-25%. It may be concluded that the roughness at a centimeter scale is comparable
to the roughness at a decimeter scale.<BR>
<BR>


Pine Forest data confirm that trend since the entropy increases and 
<img src="/symbols/lambda.gif" alt="[Lambda]"><sub>1</sub>
is still decreasing (40-45% in L-band and 45-50% in C-band).<BR>
<BR>


This decomposition of covariance matrix can be used also in the 
analysis of sea scattering.
Some investigations which have been carried out show that at 
low incidence angles
(23&#176;) the specular reflections largely dominate and 
target entropy is very low especially for L-band where the sea 
acts like a deterministic target and 
<img src="/symbols/lambda.gif" alt="[Lambda]"><sub>1</sub>
constitutes about the 98% of total entropy. 
As the incidence angle increases the entropy
increases as well and the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VV">VV</a> 
return becomes 
also up to three times the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a> 
return
(L-band at 58&#176;).<BR>
<BR>


Geology<br>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
images, because of the high incidence angle (about 50&#176;) clearly show the
differences between the western side of the Picentini mounts and the Avella mountains.
The first ones are characterized by a complex overlapping of structures while the
second ones are simply crossed by a normal fault. <BR>
<BR>
The following classes have been easily discriminated:<BR>
<BR>
1) Alluvium, pyroclastic products (ignimbrite campana), colluvium, flisch, and &quot;melange&quot;
of the sicilide unity;<BR>
<BR>
2) Carbonatic-dolomitic rocks of the &quot;Campano-Lucana&quot; platform;<BR>
<BR>
3) Bedded sands and conglomerate of the Altavilla unit.<BR>
<BR>
At low incidence angles (i.e., about 20-25&#176;) discrimination between conglomerates
and sands of the Altavilla unit, and the carbonatic formations is not possible. On
the investigated area, the differences between calcareous-dolomitic and alluvium/flisch
terrains are simply detected while the discrimination between flisch and alluvium is
a difficult task. On the Mai mountains (a part of Picentini mountains), some Trias-Giura
limits seems to be actually tectonic and not stratigraphic as pointed out in the
literature.<BR>
<BR>
In X-SAR imagery, the morphology of the Mounts Lattari stands out clearly as well
as the boundaries among carbonatic rocks, colluvium and alluvial fan and tuff or
eruptive volcanic products less or more pedogenized. The alluvial fan presents a
very thin texture while the Vesuvius 1944 lava flows are less evident.<BR>
<BR>
In the Somma-Vesuvius area, the limit between the products of pre-Mount Somma and
the undiversified pyroclastic products has been recognized by using differences of
intensity, color and texture which are due to changes of morphology, vegetation cover
and drainage pattern. Good discrimination is achieved among the characteristics of the
recent lavas, principal quarries, Mount Somma caldera rim, the drainage pattern and
the pyroclastic products of the Vesuvius cone.<BR>
<BR>
A detailed analysis of the Phlegrean Fields area requires the integration of data
acquired with different incidence angles and from different looking directions in
order to achieve a good detection of the crateric morphology and, in some cases,
for the detection of zones affected by volcano-tectonic collapses. This is the case of Mount
Gauro which is characterized by eastern and western crateric slopes slightly concave
toward the exterior, with the sides higher than the center. The east and west slopes
of the Gauro are related, according to some authors, to volcano-tectonic collapses following
explosive events that occurred about 5000 years ago.
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
images show a more
realistic morphology and the shadow distribution allows a good identification of
the heights of this crateric edge.<BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a> 
polarization allows a good characterization, in terms of tone and texture typologies,
of terrains and anthropic constructions while in the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HV">HV</a> 
images, the texture is more
homogeneous.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Research activities are still in progress. New sub-areas included in the Campania
test-site will be considered, especially for what concerns INSAR and DINSAR data
processing. For example, 16 corner reflectors have been already installed in the
area of Sannio-Matese and new installations are planned in the next months.<BR>
<BR>
Polarimetry<BR>
<BR>
Further investigations both theoretical and experimental will be carried out on quad-pol
data. <BR>
<BR>
In particular the following items are under study:
<ul type=circle>
<li>significance of eigenvector rotation and its potential
 for supervised/unsupervised
target identification and characterization;<BR>
<li>simulation of covariance matrices of some targets. Currently 
a model &quot;cloud of cylinders&quot;
with different distributions has been tested.<BR>
</ul>

Interferometry<BR>
<BR>
Since interferometric
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SLC">SLC</a> 
L-band and C-band data were not yet available for Vesuvius
or Etna, the work has been conducted on X-SAR
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SSC">SSC</a> 
products which include the Vesuvius
and a part of Matese area. Differential INSAR processing is under progress and the
results will be compared with those extracted from

Crew Training in Desert Geologic Processes<BR>
<BR>
In May of 1993 and May of 1994 Gerald Schaber, John F. McCauley and Carol Breed planned
and led two-day field trips into Northern Arizona and the Territory of the Navajo
Nation for the purpose of briefing and instructing the astronaut crews of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
in desert geologic processes and the scientific basis of the collaborative
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

Investigations of Schaber and McCauley.  These field trips, initiated at the request
of and coordinated through Dr. Tom Jones (Astronaut Office,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JSC">JSC</a>) 
, were considered by the crew members participating to be extremely helpful and instructive.  The
first field trip in May 1993 was so successful that Dr. Jones requested a repeat
for the crew of the second SRL mission.<BR>
<BR>
Mission Planning, Targeting Activities<BR>
<BR>
Between February 1994 and October, 1994 (SRL-2 mission) Carol Breed, Gerald Schaber
and J. McCauley were quite active in helping
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
Project personnel develop
complex mission targeting scenarios, especially for the numerous study sites of interest
in the Sahara, Namib, and Kalahari Deserts in Africa.  During this same time period,
this same team was also asked  by the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PI">PI</a> 
of the Saudi Arabia Investigation (Dr. A.
Dabbagh) to act as his representative with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
personnel in data-take planning and
targeting for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.<BR>

Data Acquired<BR>
<BR>
Numerous
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data takes were successfully acquired for the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PI">PI</a> 
over selected
sites in the Sahara, Namib and Kalahari Deserts of Africa during both
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
(April,
1994) and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
(October, 1994).  Some of the Sahara data takes were acquired for
joint use between this investigation and the Paleodrainage Investigation of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PI">PI</a> 
F. McCauley.
Overall, these data are of outstanding quality.  External ground based and/or airborne
radar interference patterns (especially at L-band,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HV">HV</a>) 
 are visible to various degrees on some of the images acquired over the northeastern Sahara (e.g., Egypt).
Because of the multiple passes required for the Death Valley Supersite, and other
mission planning and operations constraints, no SRL data could be acquired of the
Investigator's prime domestic test site at Jornada del Muerto NM. However, useful SRL data
were acquired of the PI's  domestic sand penetration study site located near Yuma,
Arizona.  A total of 22 standard processed
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR scenes have been specifically requested to date by the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PI">PI</a> 
for research by the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PI">PI</a> 
and his Co-I's and Collaborators:
eleven of Bir Safsaf and vicinity (Egypt); eight of Algeria/Tunisia sites; and one
each of sites in the Namib Desert (SW Africa), Yuma (AZ) and Death Valley (CA).
An updated listing of all Co-Investigators and Collaborators actively analyzing
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

data in collaboration with G. Schaber is given above.<BR>
<BR>
Since the first SRL mission (April 1994) the Principal Investigator (G. Schaber) has
focused almost exclusively on qualitative and quantitative analyses of fully processed
SRL-1
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
scenes of Bir Safsaf and vicinity (Egypt)--the prime radar penetration
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#EM">EM</a>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and

  A total of 10
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data takes
(data takes) were acquired of the Bir Safsaf study site during SRL missions 1 and
2 (April and October, 1994) (three in quadpol mode 16, three in mode 11X, one in
mode 8X, and three in interferometric mode 20X).  These data have been calibrated for radar
backscattering coefficients (Sigma 0) to  2.3 dB.  Several of the Bir Safsaf data
takes covered nearly identical image footprints for various reasons.  Image data
acquired on data takes 12.1 and 82.41 during
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
were purposely targeted slightly away from
the Bir itself in order to fill gaps in the data from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and to acquire additional
coverage.  An additional three
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
data takes that included Bir Safsaf were acquired in the &quot;interferometric mode&quot; at the same incidence angle (47.7 ) for the purpose
of obtaining topographic information.  The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
image of Bir Safsaf with the widest
swath width (48 km) was acquired during 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
data take 130.4.  This data take 130.4
was acquired in mode 11X, i.e., XVV, CHH, CHV, LHH, and LHV only.  Fully processed
X-SAR and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data requested for this site include 100-km long scenes from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 

data takes 2.1, 82.41, 98.3, 114.4 and 130.4. No
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
image scenes or interferometric
data from the Bir Safsaf Supersite have yet been requested for standard processing.<BR>

<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Progress on Studies of The Bir Safsaf (Egypt) Supersite<BR>
<BR>
The most complete and most significant research results to date for this investigation
center around the PI's analysis of data takes acquired over the Bir Safsaf Supersite
in southern Egypt.  Schaber et al. (1996) describe and illustrate how the X-, C-,
and L- band
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data each contribute unique types of significant paleoclimatic and geologic
information that is virtually obscured on conventional Landsat TM-type sensors by
the thin but pervasive cover of blow sand.  For example, the outstanding portrayals
of: (1) a NS-trending wind erosion pattern in the bedrock on only the X-band
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images,
(2) previously  poorly mapped granitoid stocks and complexly fractured granitic gneisses
and migmatites using C-cross polarization and L-band images, and (3) aggraded and blow-sand mantled, defunct, stream channels using all three
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
frequencies, document
to a degree heretofore unprecedented the considerable benefits of using multi-frequency
and polarimetric
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
imagery in geologic mapping and paleoclimatic studies of desert regions.<BR>
<BR>
Based on detailed field documentation carried out by the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PI">PI</a> 
and his colleagues (John
McCauley, Carol Breed) at Bir Safsaf following the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-A">SIR-A</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-B">SIR-B</a> 
missions (Schaber
et al., 1986), the observed differences in backscatter response are interpreted to
result primarily from: (1) increased &quot;radar imaging depth&quot; with increasing
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
wavelength
(i.e., decreasing frequency), (2) the sensitivities of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
signals of different wavelengths
and transmit/receive polarizations to different scales of micro-roughness both on the surface and within the shallow subsurface, (3) the existence on the surface
and in the shallow subsurface of iron oxides and other secondary deposits (e.g.,
calcite, gypsum, halite, etc.) with high dielectric permittivity, and (4) a combination
of these and other affects.  In simplest terms, the differences in geologic information
portrayed on SIR-C/X-
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images from the same data take are a direct result of the
specific
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
frequency and polarization mode used.  The effect of incidence angle
on discrimination of geologic features on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
images of the Bir Safsaf site was
investigated first by simple visual comparison of images from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
data takes 82.41
(22.5  incidence angle), 114.4 (46.2 ), and 130.4 (47.9 ); and subsequently by quantitative analysis of the mean and standard deviation of backscatter values for selected
geologic units.  The smaller incidence angle (or steeper antenna depression angle)
resulted in better overall image quality (in all polarization modes) for geologic
analysis than the images acquired at a larger incidence angle (or shallower depression angles).<BR>

All relevant
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR CD-ROMs from missions 1 and 2 containing data takes primarily
in Algeria and Tunisia, have been provided to Andre Simonin 
   (<a href="Acronyms.html#CNRS-IMAGEO">CNRS-IMAGEO</a>, 
 Paris)
(the PI's CO- I/Coordinator for the Northern Sahara).  Specially requested, fully
processed scenes thus far provided by the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PI">PI</a> 
(through
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>) 
 to Simonin include: Monastir,
Tunisia (2 tapes), Chott Gharsa, Tunisia, El Borma, Tunisia, Chott Djerid/DJ Asker,
Tunisia, Merkherrhane, Algeria (two tapes), and Tanezrouft, Algeria.  Scenes processed independently by the G-PAF but copies provided to Dr. Simonin include: Side El Hani,
Tunisia (two tapes); Mokine, Tunisia (two tapes); Nefta, Tunisia; Sahara/Algeria;
Quargla, Algeria, Touggourt, Algeria; and El Oued, Algeria. While awaiting the receipt
of the high resolution data, our Co-Is and Collaborators in Europe and North Africa
have been active in the field evaluating the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
Survey images.  For example,
in April, 1995, J.L. Ballais (U. Aix-Marseilles) completed a ground truth survey
over the entire study site at Chott Gharsa, Tunisia - an area in which he has over 20 years
of experience in geologic mapping.  Ballais collected (with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#GPS">GPS</a> 
location control)
samples, surface properties, topography, vegetation cover, etc.  His preliminary
correlation of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
survey data with ground truth at Chott Gharsa resulted in very high
expectations when comparing (in the near future) the fully processed
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images with
regard to geomorphology and geology in southern Tunisia--especially in synergy with
Landsat and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPOT">SPOT</a> 
data.<BR>
<BR>
At the Merkerrhane site in Algeria, Y. Callot (Univ. Tours) is presently conducting
a visual evaluation of a print of an X-SAR, fully processed scene of the Sebkras
Merkerrhane area.  J. Chorowicz and C. Chalah (LGST Lab. Univ. P &amp; M. Curie, Paris)
are pursuing the processing and interpretation of an
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
image over the Tanezrouft site
(Algeria) that they intend to compare with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR fully processed data.
They report that, compared to Landsat and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPOT">SPOT</a> 
images, the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
images reveal some
penetration of the sand sheets, allowing the interpretation of slightly buried structures.<BR>
<BR>
Mauritanian Sites<BR>
<BR>
Fully processed data will be provided by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
on a Mauritanian site to Dr. J. P. Deroin
(BRGM-Orleans) from data take 132.30 (Western Africa).  Evaluation of an
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
scene
and field survey have been conducted over this area in 1995 (Deroin and Simonin),
and will be presented  at the Toulouse meeting in October 1995.<BR>
<BR>
Progress on Namib Desert Studies (SW Africa)<BR>
<BR>
Co-Investigator Nick Lancaster (Desert Research Institute-Reno NV) reports the SRL

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images of the northern part of the Namib sand sea in southwest Africa provide
an enhanced view of Quaternary fluvial deposits in the region.  Previous studies
(e.g., Lancaster, 1984; Ward, 1987) used aerial photographs to map several generations of Pleistocene
fluvial deposits.  The extent of these deposits to the west was not fully defined
because they were covered by a thin aeolian sand cover.  SRL images show clearly
the extent of calcrete-cemented fluvial gravels in the area west and south of the Kuiseb
River.  These gravels extend much farther west than mapped by Ward (1987).  C- and
L-band
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a> 
polarized data provide the best images of these deposits, which have a
bright radar signature as a result of their rough surfaces.<BR>
<BR>
In the lower Tsondab River valley (also know as the Tsonab Flats) SRL images enable
identification of fluvial gravels between 5- to 10-m-high linear and crescentic dunes.
In many areas, the former meandering river channels can be accurately mapped, something that Lancaster (1984) was unable to achieve using aerial photographs.  In the
area south of the Kuiseb River, SRL images show that a dendritic drainage network
is developed on older calcrete-cemented gravels.  This drainage network is directed
from east to west and has never previously been identified as such. They were suggested to
be some form of patterned ground by Besier (1980) and Watson (1980). Ward (1987),
however, suggested that these features were macro-scale fractures developed during
diagenesis of the underlying Tertiary-age Tsondab Sandstone Formation.  The channels are imaged
as dark tones, suggesting that they are filled by thin aeolian or fluvial sands.
The amount of the network discernible on the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images changes with radar wavelength.  The best resolution of the channels and most complete network are obtained with
X-band data, followed by C-, and then L-band. This suggests that there is penetration
of the sands by longer wavelengths and gives a general impression of the depth of
sand cover in the channels, which increases with stream order.  Further studies are planned
to explore the full potential of the SRL data, now that full- resolution images are
available.  These studies will include comparison between radar and Landsat
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TM">TM</a> 
data
and estimates of the depth of radar penetration using information from past field studies
by Lancaster.  We plan to prepare at least one manuscript for submittal in early
1996.  Some of the results of this study will be presented at the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IGCP">IGCP</a> 
349 meeting
&quot;Desert margins&quot;... to be held in the United Arab Emirates in December, 1995.<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
Studies of the Precambrian Hamisana and Nakasib Structures, NE Sudan, in Arid
Regions of Low Relief and in the Subsurface<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
a) Develop techniques for optimizing structural analysis of basement trends in arid
regions with extremely subdued topography and/or thin aeolian cover.<BR>
<BR>
b) Apply results of (a) to map the southern extension of the Hamisana Shear Zone and
the western extension of Nakasib Suture.<BR>
<BR>
c) Apply results of (b) to constrain the roles of terrane accretion and strike-slip
re-organization for late Precambrian crustal evolution in NE Africa.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Our proposal called for evaluating the suitability of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
imagery for resolving
basement structures in hyperarid regions where visible and near-infrared imagery
revealed only sand covering.  Specifically, we proposed using the radar data to define
the southern extension of the Hamisana Shear Zone in NE Sudan.  This Precambrian basement
structure lies in the Sahara Desert, earth's most hyperarid environment.  We had
previously exhausted efforts to use conventional imagery to resolve the structure.
The study area that we originally proposed is shown as 'Original Proposed Study Area'
in Fig. 1.  In preparing for the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
experiments, field studies led us to
recognize that a parallel but more westerly structure was also important.  This is
the poorly exposed and consequently very poorly known Keraf Shear Zone.  Following preliminary
field studies which indicated that the Hamisana may terminate just south of its present
outcrop limit, and that the Keraf Shear Zone may be more important than previously thought, we redirected our efforts towards studying the Keraf.  This is a slight
change in direction that has been justified by subsequent discoveries resulting from
our interpretation of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
imagery.<BR>
<BR>
Prior to receiving the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data, we carried out a field program based on structural
interpretation of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-A">SIR-A</a> 
data over the northern part of the Keraf Shear Zone.  This
was done in order to better prepare us to interpret the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
images and to define the fundamental structural characteristics of the Keraf that were likely to
be so identified.  The location of this 'SIR-A pilot study' is shown in Fig. 1, and
the results of this investigation have been published (Schandelmeier et al., 1994;
Stern et al., 1993) or are now in press (Abdelsalam et al., in press).  We also took advantage
of the preparation phase to prepare an overview summarizing the sequence of events
and global significance of the tectonic evolution of the Arabian-Nubian Shield (Stern 1994).<BR>
<BR>
Progress in the Past 1.5 years<BR>
<BR>
Our experiment  continues to focus on using the multi-parameter characteristics of
the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
imagery to find, define, and interpret geologic features in hyperarid
regions, and to understand the extent to which the radar is resolving structure by
penetration through sand or back-scattering from subtle topographic expressions of structure.
Once the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data were acquired, we compiled
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and -2 survey data over
all of NE Sudan.   This involved obtaining reconnaissance L-band data takes (Alden prints) and compiling these with reference to known geologic structures. This comprehensive
data set was then studied to identify where further processing efforts and field
studies (ground-truth efforts) should be concentrated.   This work was completed
at the end of Spring 1995, and because the quality of the L-band Alden prints is very
similar to that of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-A">SIR-A</a>, 
 we were well prepared to interpret these images on the
basis of our pilot study in the northern Keraf Zone.  This phase of our study indicated
that the original focus - tracing the southern continuation of the Hamisana Shear Zone
- was not likely to be fruitful, and we switched our primary focus to the heretofore
unknown southern part of the Keraf Shear Zone, where we are confident that our original objectives can be attained.  This area is labeled 'New Area of Primary Concentration'
in Fig. 1.  The first and most exciting result to date was our discovery on the radar
imagery and subsequent ground verification of two previously unrecognized shear zones (which we have named 'Abu Hamed Shear Zone' and 'Abu Dis Shear Zone'; Fig. 2)
along the Nile north of Atbara.  This is the southern part of the Keraf zone, and
while its existence has been long suspected to lie in this region on the basis of
isotopic considerations, it was not until we examined the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
imagery that the location,
trend, and even the existence of this important lithospheric structure in this region
was demonstrated.<BR>
<BR>
This discovery was the result of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
imaging capabilities, and we are
now concentrating on understanding and exploiting this result.  We are convinced
that this discovery dramatically demonstrates the importance of radar to geological
studies in hyperarid, poorly known regions, among which the Sahara Desert is the type example.
After careful study, we conclude that almost none of the structures visible on the
radar images (Fig. 3) can be seen on images produced from a wide range of visible
and near infrared sensors.  We have studied Landsat
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TM">TM</a> 
images, Shuttle hand-held photography
(acquired during the April 1994 flight), and 1:80,000 air photos in efforts to discern
structures that are vividly revealed in the radar images.  We conclude that there is no way that the visible and near-infrared images could have been processed or
interpreted that could have resolved these structures.<BR>
<BR>
It is presently unclear how much of the radar's sensitivity to structure is the result
of penetration of sand drapes and how much is due to subtle variations in topography
and low, nearly-hidden outcrops.  Answering this question is an important part of
the work that remains to be done in the next two years.<BR>
<BR>
Just how spectacular the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
images of the area are is shown in Fig. 3, a very small
part of the region shown in Fig. 2.  This scene was processed at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#UTD">UTD</a>. 
 The radar images
show remarkable detail over the shear zone, revealing a complex, intensely folded
region to the east of the Abu Dis shear zone and a less intensely deformed region
to the west of the shear zone. We carried out three weeks of field studies in the
region last April.  This concentrated on refining our structural interpretations
of selected portions of the region shown in Fig. 3, and on understanding how much of the structure
is buried beneath dry, wind-blown sand (and how thick is this cover).  Our preliminary
estimate is that a variable thickness of sand covers a basement peneplain. Our preliminary estimate is that about 10-20% of the desert surface is  low basement outcrop
and the other 80-90% is 2-200 cm of windblown sand. The situation in the field is
shown in Fig. 4, as is how the region appears with visible and near-infrared imagery.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Our work is continuing, but we have prepared two abstracts on our results (Abdelsalam
et al., submitted; Stern et al., submitted) that will be presented at the 1995 national
meeting of the Geological Society of America meeting in November.  We are also preparing a manuscript (Stern et al., in prep.) that will be submitted to the special
volume of JGR-Green on geologic results from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and 2.  Another manuscript nearing
completion reports the results of our structural studies of southern Keraf Shear
Zone, based on interpretation of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data and field investigations (Abdelsalam
et al., in prep.). Several other publications are planned following completion of
our studies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Our top priority is completing the analysis of data sets that cover the 'New Area
of Primary Concentration' outlined in Fig. 2, and publication of these results.
We have all of the radar data sets that we need, and we are proceeding with the following
work plan: 1) Assembly of L-band total power image (black and white) over the entire
area outlined in Fig. 2.; 2) Generation of individual false-color L-, C-, and L/C
images for subscenes covering all of Fig. 2;  3) Coregistration of L-, C-, and X-band
data sets for selected parts of the region outlined in Fig. 2; and 4) Field checking of
results following final image processing.  Items 1 and 2 are well in hand, and these
tasks should be completed sometime in the next 2 months.  We place a very high value
on item 3.  One of the few disappointments of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
experiment has been the
scarcity of images that use all three wavelengths.  This is unfortunate for two reasons.
First, the international nature of the experiment means that a very real part of
the collaboration is reflected by the products that use both data sets, and the relative
lack of these products can all too easily be interpreted as indicating a lack of
true co-operation.  Second, the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
platform is unique in acquiring simultaneous
multi-wavelength data, and this aspect should be considered for future orbital radar
platforms.  Coregistration of all three wavelengths is a very high priority, and
this task is being carried out with S. Okonek and other scientists at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>. 
  An important
part of this effort will be comparing images produced from the three-wavelength coregistered
data with images produced using only L-, C-, and L/C.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, we require another 2- to 3-week field expedition to Sudan.  This is needed
in order to carry out GPS-controlled field checks of our structural interpretations,
collect a few samples for radiometric age determinations needed to constrain the
age of deformation, and to quantify the depth of sand cover and percentage of basement exposure.
This work will be the focus of our efforts during most of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#FY">FY</a> 
96.<BR>
<BR>
In late
   <a href="Acronyms.html#FY">FY</a> 
96 and early
   <a href="Acronyms.html#FY">FY</a> 
97, following completion of the primary tasks outlined
above, we will turn our attention to application of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data to another poorly
exposed region along the Nile in Sudan, shown as 'New Area of Secondary Concentration'
in Fig. 2.  The work plan for this area will be similar to that outlined above or
the Keraf area: 1) Assembly of L-band total power image; 2) Generation of detailed
false-color images, either coregistered X-, C-, and L-band data, or L-, C-, and L/C,
depending on the results of our study outlined above; and 3) Field work to verify and modify
interpretations and provide data regarding amounts and depths of sedimentary cover.
The data sets that we need to conduct this phase of the work are about half complete, and we expect to submit requests for another 10-15 precision products to both
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 

and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DLR">DLR</a>. 
<BR>
<BR>
Finally, in late
   <a href="Acronyms.html#FY">FY</a> 
97, we hope to apply our refined techniques to a study of the
Allaqi-Heiani suture.  This fundamental lithosphere structure in SE Egypt is poorly
known, but appears to be deflected by the northern extension of the Keraf Zone.
If time and funds allow, we would like to carry out the sorts of investigations outlined above
to studying this structure.  If this work moves forward, we expect to require another
20 precision products from both 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DLR">DLR</a>.

<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
To assess the utility of multipolarization multifrequency spaceborne radar for surficial
sediment mapping (lithology, rock weathering, and geochronology,) and groundwater
management (arid regimes) in a variety of Australian environments.<BR>
<BR>
To establish the utility of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
imagery for recognizing basement structures
(tectonics and geologic boundaries) by mapping drape-related fractures in overlying
surficial sediments.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Data acquired<BR>
<BR>
The Australian group was able to acquire data over several of its test sites during
the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
campaign of September 1993 and the two
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
missions. The principal purpose of each
site was as follows:<BR>
<BR>
<strong>AIRSAR<BR></strong>
<BR>
Pyramid Hill (Kerang) - Soil salinity mapping with dielectric constant measurements<BR>
Palm Valley - 3-Dimensional geological structural analysis  of the Palm Valley Gas
Field<BR>
Fowlers Gap - Studies of the regolith and geological mapping <BR>
Yass - Dryland salinity mapping in an area of moderate relief<BR>

Palm Valley - 3-Dimensional geological structural analysis  of the Palm Valley Gas
Field<BR>
plus<BR>
Northern Luzon, Philippines - geological, structural, and environmental mapping<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Pyramid Hill (Kerang) -  Inversion of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data has allowed for the mapping of the Complex Dielectric
Constants over the study region. Atypical wet soil conditions at the time of acquisition
meant that variations in the dielectric constant were due mainly to the imaginary
part of the complex constant, and hence due to salinity. The dielectric constant maps
provide the best available maps of soil  salinity for the region. The L-band-derived
image provides the best indication of surface salinity 
(<a href="gifs/taylor1.gif">Figure 1 (447K GIF)</a>).
 The dielectric
maps derived from C-, L- and P-band give indications of the extent of salinity at depth 
(<a href="gifs/taylor2.gif">Figure 2 (380K GIF)</a>)
 and can be combined
to give a color composite that clearly indicates the severity of salinity 
(<a href="gifs/taylor3.gif">Figure 3 (329K GIF)</a>).<BR>
<BR>
Comparison of the various available inversion techniques  shows that in this region of low relief, the small perturbation model discriminates saline areas well but underestimates the magnitude
of the dielectric constant. The semi-empirical method developed at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
provides the
best results. These may be compared qualitatively as follows:<BR>

Both the UNSW small perturbation inversion and the semi-empirical
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
inversion have been applied to several
of the available
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
scenes. Problems with modifying code to take appropriate account
of incidence angle have delayed the work. To date we have found that the dielectric maps give a good indication of the local soil moisture content 
(<a href="gifs/taylor5a.gif">Figure 5a (299K GIF)</a>).
 This
in turn is related to the recent irrigation history. Only on one data take 
   (<a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a>,

that was so visible on the

(<a href="gifs/taylor5b.gif">Figure 5b (316K GIF)</a>).
 Inversions of the small incidence angle images appear to give much noisier
maps of the dielectric constant than do the large incidence angle images. The

3 -Dimensional geological structural analysis  of the Palm Valley Gas Field<BR>
<BR>
We have developed software, VECTOR3D, using the Interactive Data Language (IDL), that
allows the elevation of any point along the trace of a geological feature visible
in the remotely sensed image to be derived from the integrated digital terrain data.
Several different methods are provided for the estimation of the dip and strike of the
inferred geological structure and for testing the reliability of the determination.
Additional  tools are provided for annotation of interpreted features, modeling of geological structures, and the estimation of the depth to particular modeled structures. <BR>

The Yass

op
an inversion algorithm which takes into account the topography, calculates local
incidence angle for each pixel, and hence might give more reliable estimates of the surface dielectrics. <BR>

Radar Investigations of Volcanism and Tectonism of the Northern Andes<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Increase understanding of the volcano-tectonic history of the Northern Andes of Colombia
and Ecuador by testing and extending the volcano-tectonic segmentation model proposed
by Hall and Wood (1985).<BR>
<BR>
Develop radar models for detecting and mapping pyroclastic and mudflow deposits at
Ruiz and other dangerous volcanoes of the Northern Andes.<BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
Radar Investigations of Volcanism and Tectonism of the Northern Andes was selected
for participation in the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
mission in 1988. We proposed a series of inter-related
multi-disciplinary investigations to generate new information to (a) characterize radar roughness, (b) determine the relation of volcanism and tectonism in a poorly
known volcanic arc, and (c) study hazards related to Ruiz volcano, Colombia and other
potentially active volcanoes of the Northern Andes.  Significant progress was made
on each of these tasks, and the eventual arrival of actual
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data has accelerated
our research efforts, with the first results now being presented at national meetings.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Discoveries came within minutes of examining the first
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
images provided to the
team. Examination of the first browse image of DT-80.10 from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
resulted in the
recognition of a very young volcano that was unknown to the international volcanological
community. Within minutes, two older possible calderas were found in other parts of
the first swath.  These discoveries resulted in
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASA">NASA</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
issuing a press release
image and caption of San Diego volcano in northern Colombia, and these first results
also were presented at the Geologic Society of America meeting in Seattle in fall, 1994
(Wood et al, 1994). Now that the easy results have been announced, the hard work
of detailed analysis and interpretation is well underway.<BR>
<BR>
Our team includes the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PI">PI</a> 
and Co-Is listed above and the students we are working with.
We are very proud that
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
funding has partially supported a number of graduate
students, one of whom is now a post-doctoral fellow (Austin); two more are completing
(Wessels) and starting (Gorman) PhD theses based on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data; and two others are undertaking
masters degree projects (Borysewicz and K. Williams).<BR>
<BR>
Radar Roughness Studies<BR>
<BR>
Theoretical and experimental study to improve modeling of  the mechanisms of radar
scattering have been completed; application to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data is just beginning. Field
measurements of the roughness spectrum at radar wavelength scales of millimeters
to meters were obtained at Mt. St. Helens using normal surveying and a specially-designed computer-controlled

   <a href="Acronyms.html#2-D">2-D</a> 
laser profilometer (Austin and England, 1993).  Specific conclusions include:<BR>
<BR>
The surface profile measurements at Mt. St. Helens and the resulting spectral estimates
show that some, but not all, volcanic debris flow terrains have a power-law roughness
spectrum over some range of spatial frequencies.  Low and high-frequency spectral
estimates from the primary debris flow surfaces seemed to conform to a single power
law from about 0.05 to 25 or 50 m-1.  It is expected that the intermediate-frequency
region (roughly 0.25 to 2 m-1) follows the same power law, but this cannot be verified
without additional surface profiles with a sampling  interval in the 12.5-cm range.
The flow surfaces that did not exhibit a power-law spectrum appeared to be part
of a fluvial plain; i.e. they were not volcanic.<BR>
<BR>
The one- and two-dimensional power-law fits to the spectral estimates derived from
the volcanic debris flow profiles yield spectral slopes between -2.31 and -2.51,
corresponding to surface fractal dimensions of 2.245 and 2.345.  Fractal dimensions
near 2.2 were cited by Mandelbrot and others as producing naturally realistic profiles.  We
found that spectra with slopes less than -2.0 could not have been measured using
spectral estimators like the periodogram that are sensitive to low-frequency, spectral
leakage.  The leakage problem may be responsible for the fixed values of -2.0 reported
in the literature.<BR>
<BR>
Three power-law surfaces were manufactured in a plastic dielectric to have fractal
dimensions of 2.100, 2.228, and 2.355.  The polarized radar backscatter cross-sections
were measured as a function of incidence angle for the three surfaces.  In all cases,
the scattering cross-sections decrease with incidence angle.  Greatest sensitivity
to spectral slope occurred for like-polarized cross-sections between 40 and 50 degrees
and for cross-polarized cross-sections between 45 and 50 degrees.<BR>
<BR>
None of the current theoretical models did a great job of explaining the backscatter
observations.  We explored a new theory, the Phased Wiener-Hermite model, but it
was no better than average among the models.  The best of the current theories was
the Small Perturbation (SP) model.  The shape of the responses were  correct though  absolute
amplitudes were  often offset by as  much as <BR>
5 dB.<BR>
<BR>
A major purpose of developing the new theoretical and field understanding of radar
roughness is to apply it to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data of volcanic regions in the Andes. During the
summer of 1995 we began to develop a roughness classification scheme for full-resolution,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
radar images of the Colombian Ruiz volcano.  Our candidate algorithms were
based upon combinations of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SP">SP</a> 
theory and our experimental observations. The early
versions appear to have worked in some areas, but not others.  We are now investigating
those cases where they failed.<BR>
<BR>
We expect the final classifier to be an empirical algorithm guided by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SP">SP</a> 
theory and
our experiments. Dr. Richard Austin, who is now a post-doctoral scientist in Australia,
is guiding the development of the algorithm through e-mail.  A senior-level engineering student spends a few hours per week testing algorithms on the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data.  We
expect to have a best estimate of a classifier by early 1996 and to have produced
a report by May 1996. The classified image will then be provided to the volcanologist
members of the team for geologic interpretation.<BR>
<BR>
Volcanic Geology and Tectonics Study: Stan Williams, Rick Wessels and Caitlin Gorman<BR>
<BR>
The Arizona component of our
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
team is focusing on studies of the tectonic controls
of volcanism and the detailed mapping of hazardous volcanoes. Their main geographic
area of interest is Colombia. Their initial interpretation of regional tectonics
of Northern Andes using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
survey data began in July of 1994, and since March
1995 new work has started on the full resolution data sets of specific areas.<BR>
<BR>
A major accomplishment by Wessels has been the assembly of a geo-referenced on-line
mosaic of twenty survey images over the active volcanic arc (covering 900 x 130 km).
This giant mosaic provides the absolutely best data set for regional volcano-tectonic
investigations of the Northern Andes. We are investigating how such a mammoth photo
image might be published. This is a case where looking at a compressed version or
a series of individual sections on a computer monitor is vastly inferior to having
the entire nearly 3 meter long hard copy rolled out on a table!<BR>
<BR>
Wessels has also compiled a mosaic of three high-resolution subscenes from two data
takes (computer processed, geo-referenced and  mosaicked) for structure/geomorphology
interpretation.  More scenes will be added to expand the  mosaic and the analysis.
Both the large survey mosaic and the high resolution one are base layers for geographic
information system (GIS) studies to aid regional interpretations. Additional layers
include structural field data, seismicity, published faults, geochemistry, geochronology and eruptive activity. Experiments are starting to merge
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data with Landsat

   <a href="Acronyms.html#TM">TM</a>, 
 scanned shuttle photographs and AIRSAR/TOPSAR data for detailed analyses. Early
results from this work will be  presented at the fall 1995 American Geophysical Union
meeting by Wessels.  The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
images are being used for geologic field research by Caitlin
Gorman and Wessels.<BR>
<BR>
Wessels will use subscenes of MLC products to document variations in active volcano
morphology related to regional fault geometry. The data will be used to precisely
measure orientations, areas, and vent locations.  MLC data will also be used to better
define previously unrecognized or poorly known volcanoes related to the faults.  Wessels
will also combine the regional information with individual volcano
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 
data from
the 1993 AIRSAR/TOPSAR flights.  The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR data received so far is very
good. X-SAR scenes will be requested of Galeras  and Cumbal volcanoes to combine with our
96.10
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data.  Full resolution
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data will also be requested for areas
south of the Ruiz-Tolima scene to carefully examine poorly known volcanoes along
the Palistina Fault.<BR>
<BR>
Wessels and collaborators plan several possible papers which will comprise part of
his dissertation:<BR>
<BR>
The interaction of transcurrent tectonics and continental arc volcanism in Colombia
and Ecuador. Overview for submission to Geology Summer 1996.  Modeling the role of

<BR>
Volcanic Geology and Tectonics Study: Chuck Wood, Pete Hall, Henry Borysewicz and
Kymbra Williams<BR>
<BR>
To gain experience in working with radar we acquired a Russian Almaz radar image of
part of the Northern Andes. The image was disappointing in resolution and signal
to noise. We also were fortunate in acquiring significant
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
images of Colombian
volcanoes during a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASA">NASA</a> 
flight to South America. Those images are being analyzed in association
with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data.<BR>
<BR>
In preparation for analyzing
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data, Hall continued field studies of Ecuadorian
volcanoes, providing a grounded framework for interpreting the future satellite images.
This work has culminated in major studies of the Plio-Quaternary volcanism in Ecuador (Hall and Beate, 1991) and the tephrochronology of Holocene volcanoes in Ecuador
(Hall and Mothes, 1994a). Hall has also coordinated the monitoring and evaluation
of hazardous volcanoes in Ecuador (e.g. Hall and Mothes, 1994b) and established programs
to mitigate future eruptions.
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
images are now being integrated into these types
of studies, and will be a major source of data for future investigations of volcanism,
tectonics and hazards by Hall and his colleagues. For example, an ongoing project
to map the geology and potential hazards of Cayambe volcano will now incorporate information
from high resolution
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
images.<BR>
<BR>
In 1993 Wood and Hall participated in a symposium on Galeras volcano which was organized
by Williams. Galeras is a good example of a volcano which is a great potential hazard,
for the city of Pasto (population 600,000) sits directly on the volcano's flanks. At the meeting, Wood presented a paper on the use of remote sensing to monitor active
volcanoes, and Hall is now planning on adding 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
images to the arsenal of data
used to evaluate threats from Ecuador's volcanoes.<BR>
<BR>
One of the original reasons for proposing to participate in
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
was the frustration
that we experienced when trying to assemble Landsat images of the Northern Andes
for our original synthesis of volcanism and tectonics (Hall and Wood, 1985). Because

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
has spectacularly
penetrated the cloud barrier, allowing a compilation of a new regional synthesis of the tectonic controls on volcanism in Ecuador and Colombia.  Thus our first
task, during Woods' recent three-week visit to Ecuador, was to closely examine the

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
images and Wessels mosaic, searching for additional unknown and little
known volcanoes and tectonic features. The directions of this new research - which will continue
for the next two years and will lead ultimately to a major revision of Hall and Wood
(1985) - include: <BR>
<BR>
1. Recognition of new volcanic structures in the northern Andes (many possible volcanoes
located in southern Colombia),<BR>
<BR>
2. Improved interpretation of the major fault distribution in Ecuador,<BR>
<BR>
3. Reconsideration of the major change in volcanism at the Galeras segmentation boundary,
from the multi-row, varied chemistry of the southern volcanoes to the single line
of Colombian volcanoes to the north.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
The acquisition of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data for nearly the entire 2000-km-long Northern Andes volcanic
arc provides an unique opportunity to examine how volcano distributions, sizes, and
types change through time. Wood, Hall and their students intend to catalog and characterize each major volcano in the arc, based on its morphology as displayed in the
radar images and available ancillary information. In particular, we wish to investigate
changes in the dip of the subducted Nazca slab (estimated from potassium values (K60) in volcanic rocks) with time. We will infer ages of volcanoes from their morphology
as  seen on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
images, calibrated by known radiometric dates. The inferred resulting
history of volcanic evolution will then be tied to changes in plate movements in
the central Pacific.<BR>
<BR>
In order to clearly understand what
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
images show, Borysewicz has initiated
a M.S. thesis comparing variations in radar brightness with known volcanic units
for a few Andean volcanoes that have been adequately mapped on the ground. Chimborazo,
Galeras and Cotopaxi volcanoes serve as ground truth and Borysewicz will examine the
effects of different polarizations, bands and look angles in identifying volcanic
lava flows, tephra deposits and debris avalanche deposits. <BR>
<BR>
One significant but intangible result of studying
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
images is that the new perspectives
raise numerous questions which initiate new directions for investigation. One major
such refocusing is due to the remarkable appearance of a suspected caldera beyond the southern extension of known Quaternary  volcanism  in  Ecuador.   The  5-km-wide
Quimsacocha  caldera  is  surrounded  by  a<BR>
~25-km- wide dark patch on the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
images, and the caldera rim is remarkably sharp.
These features suggest that the caldera and its associated andesitic ejecta may be
much younger than the proposed age of 11-15 million years. If so, the Northern Andes
volcanic arc extends further south than anyone knew, and there is a real problem explaining
why, tectonically. We are planning field work to collect samples for radiometric
dating, and also are re-examining earthquake data to better understand subduction
in this region.<BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
images provide the first consistent view of volcanoes throughout the entire
Northern Andes island arc. In order to make this valuable resource available to a
wider scientific and educational community Wood, Hall and K. Williams are preparing
a digital atlas of the best available
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a>, 
 Landsat,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPOT">SPOT</a> 
and ground images of each volcano
in Ecuador and Colombia. This annotated collection will also include existing geological
and chemical information as well as the images. This
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
based database will completely replace the 30-year-old Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World volume on
Ecuador and Colombia. Currently this compilation is part of Wood's NASA-funded Internet
homepage, VolcanoWorld. The URL to go directly to the Northern Andes is<BR>

a goal is that VW will ultimately include all

<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
The overall objectives of the experiment were to evaluate the capabilities of multidate,
multiparameter
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data to estimate soil moisture in an agricultural environment
for a variety of soil types in the spring and fall, develop models which provide
a better understanding on the relationships between soil moisture and texture, surface
roughness and radar frequency, polarization and incidence angle, evaluate the use
of a change detection approach for soil moisture monitoring and to gain a better
understanding of the information content of polarimetric data. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Temporal changes in
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a>, 
 C- and L-band radar backscatter over the Altona site in
relation to changing environmental conditions such as frost, rain and soil moisture
have been evaluated. In addition, the soil moisture model developed by J. C. Shi
has been applied to the data. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
The results indicate that environmental events such as frost and rain can be monitored.
However, care must be taken as some soil targets at high moisture contents may behave
as specular reflectors at longer wavelengths, such as L-band at large incidence angles which will mask soil moisture effects. The strongest correlation (rho=.84) with
soil moisture was obtained for the 0-2.5 cm soil profile at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a> 
polarizations and
was approximately the same at C- and L-band. All polarizations displayed a decrease
in soil moisture correlation with increasing soil profile depths. It was observed that soil
texture effects on the estimation of soil moisture from radar backscatter are relatively
small and can be neglected. Although the sensitivity to surface roughness is greater at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HV">HV</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VV">VV</a> 
than at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a> 
polarization, it is possible that roughness could be neglected
when measuring soil moisture over relatively short periods of time at a given site
without significantly reducing the sensitivity of the relationship between radar
backscatter and soil moisture. The L-band soil moisture model produced estimated values
which were in good agreement with the observed conditions.<BR>

Investigations of Snow Properties in Alpine Terrain<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Estimate snow-covered area and distribution of snow water equivalence over alpine
drainage basins.  Surface material may be trees that are taller than the snow depth,
brush, or grass that will be covered by the snow, soil, scree, talus, or bedrock,
or glacier ice.<BR>
<BR>
Estimate spectral albedo of snow cover.<BR>
<BR>
Model spatial distribution of snow surface energy exchange, melt rate, and snow metamorphism
intensively during two-to-four-week periods around
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
flights, and less
intensively during the rest of the snow season.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Our recent studies, using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data, have shown a significant improvement
in understanding and modeling backscattering and polarization properties as a function
of snow parameters.  Maps of snow-covered areas derived from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
now compare well with those derived from visible images, which require clear
weather and daylight. A better than 80% accuracy for both dry and wet snow covers
can be achieved when compared with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TM">TM</a> 
classification results.  We have developed
an accurate algorithm to retrieve snow-wetness, which indicates where and at what rate snow
is melting.  The tested results using C-band
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data indicated
that an accuracy of 2.5% can be achieved at 95% confidence interval. We have developed
an algorithm to estimate snow density and depth. The initial test showed very promising
results.  Thus, accurate information about the spatial and temporal distributions
of snow water equivalency and melting status of snow cover can be provided by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

for hydrological and climatic investigations and operations.<BR>
<BR>
Field Measurements<BR>
<BR>
During the first and second
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
missions in April and October 1994, we carried
out near-simultaneous field campaigns at three test sites: Mammoth Mountain in the
Sierra Nevada, California, the &Uuml;r&uuml;mqi River basin in the Tien Shan, China, and the
Echaurren basin in the Andes, Chile.<BR>
<BR>
At the Mammoth site, three corner reflectors were used for calibration.  We selected
three test sites near Mammoth Mountain based on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
passes.  For each data-take
we measured two snow-pits for the vertical profile of snow properties at each site: temperature, snow density, grain size and size distribution, free liquid water content,
and stratification.  In addition, we measured snow properties along two transects
that cross each site for information about spatial distribution. Those measurements
included snow depth, density, wetness, and surface roughness.<BR>
<BR>
At the Tien Shan site, five corner reflectors were used for calibration.  Snow properties
measurements included snow temperature, depth, and density.  At the Echaurren site,
we measured snow temperature, depth, density, particle size, and surface roughness.<BR>
<BR>
Microwave Modeling and Backscattering Response to Snow Parameters<BR>
<BR>
The main problem in estimating snow properties from remote sensing data is understanding
the links between the electromagnetic interactions in different parts of the spectrum
and the physical properties of the snow.  Modeling microwave backscattering from
snowpacks requires knowledge of snow characteristics and their dynamics to select
an appropriate model.  Both theory and field data show that microwave backscattering
coefficients are sensitive to parameters describing snow microstructure.<BR>
<BR>
Stereological methods, applied to images of sections cut from undisturbed snow, are
used to obtain accurate, unbiased estimates of snow microstructure parameters for
discrete scatterer modeling.  Our recent studies have found that the ice particle
size distribution in seasonal snow can be characterized as a log-normal distribution function.
The required parameters (the geometric mean diameter and standard deviation of particle
diameters) for fully describing the particle size variation and distribution can be directly measured by stereological variables.  The results show that in addition
to snow density and ice particle size, the particle size variation affects extinction
properties of dry snow.  The optically equivalent ice particle size for Rayleigh
scattering in a snowpack with grain size variations can be determined from the stereological
data.<BR>
<BR>
We have developed a polarimetric model that includes both surface and volume scattering
as well as the interaction terms between surface and volume.  Radiative transfer
models for dense media and the random media were used for the volume scattering.
The surface scattering models 
   (<a href="Acronyms.html#IEM">IEM</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPM">SPM</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#POM">POM</a>, 
 and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#GOM">GOM</a>) 
 were introduced to the radiative
transfer equations in order to evaluate the importance of the interactions between
the surface and volume scattering signals.<BR>
<BR>
Through
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data analyses and model simulations, we found that backscattering measurements
from dry snow are affected by three sets of parameters: (1) sensor parameters, (2)
snowpack parameters, and (3) ground parameters.  The relationships between backscattering signals and snow water equivalence can be either positive or negative, depending
on the snow physical parameters, ground surface parameters, and incidence angle.
In addition to snow density and ice particle size, size variation, snowpack stratification, and underlying ground conditions affect the interpretation of the observed
backscattering signals.  When the scattering signal from the snowpack is greater
than the signal from the ground (attenuated by the overlying snow), a positive correlation
is expected.  Otherwise, the correlation is negative.<BR>
<BR>
We also found that the relationship between the co-polarization signals at C-band
and snow wetness is controlled by the scattering mechanisms.  In addition to the
snow properties, the surface roughness and local incidence angle play an important
role in the relationships between the co-polarization signals and snow wetness.  This relationship
can be either positive or negative, depending on the snow properties, surface roughness,
and incidence angle.<BR>
<BR>
Snow Mapping<BR>
<BR>
Previously, snow in alpine regions has been mapped with conventional
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
imagery by
comparing a geocoded
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
image with a simulated image.  This method requires a compatible
digital elevation model (DEM) for generation of the simulated image, and that the

   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data be coregistered. The capability of a single-polarization
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
in mapping
snow-cover is limited to wet snow condition.  Single polarization SARs operating
at 5.3 GHz (C-band) can map wet snow and ice-free surfaces, but they poorly separate
glacier ice from snow and rock.<BR>
<BR>
Through evaluation of the characteristics of the backscattering and polarization response
of snow, we found that mapping snow in remote alpine regions by using intensity measurements
requires topographic information to obtain correct radiometric measurements and to reduce angular dependence for discrimination. Because the measurements of
polarization properties and of the ratios between different frequencies provided
by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
do not require topographic correction, an appropriable selection of
these measurements through evaluating the incidence angle dependence and separability between
different targets within the scene makes it possible to map snow covers without requiring
topographic information in remote alpine regions. Using this technique, we compared the coregistered
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TM">TM</a> 
classification results with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
classification results.
Accuracies better than 80% for wet snow-covered from pixel-by-pixel comparison can
be obtained for binary classification.  The major difference between
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TM">TM</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
binary classification results are due to the mixed pixel problem.  In addition,
we have found that
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
can map dry snow cover when multifrequency and multipolarization
data with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 
are used. This is in contrast with single-polarization SARs which are limited only to mapping wet snow cover. A similar accuracy can also be obtained.
Currently, we are evaluating the possibility of mapping dry snow cover without requiring
topographic information.  Thus,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
has comparable capability with the visible and near-infrared sensors to map both dry and wet snow covers.<BR>
<BR>
Snow Wetness<BR>
<BR>
From a verified backscattering model, we have developed an algorithm for retrieving
snow wetness using C-band polarimetric
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
imagery. Our algorithm is based on a first-order
scattering model, with consideration of both surface and volume scattering. At the regional scale, the inferred spatial distribution of snow wetness from two
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 

data-takes showed clear characteristics. Higher snow wetness was estimated on the
south slope than on the north slope, and the elevation dependence of snow wetness
was inferred. This agrees well with our knowledge of the characteristics of spatial distribution
of free liquid water content in snow. The comparison of SAR-derived snow wetness
with ground measurements indicated that the absolute error at 95% confidence interval
was 2.5%. Both regional and point measurement indicate that the inversion algorithm
performs well using C-band
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data and will prove useful for routine and
large-area snow wetness measurements if a multi-parameter spaceborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
becomes
available.<BR>
<BR>
Snow Water Equivalency<BR>
<BR>
Based on the numerical simulations of our polarimetric model for dry snow covered
conditions, we have developed a physical-based algorithm to estimate snow water equivalency
and the snowpack equivalent particle size.  This algorithm is based on the first-order backscattering model so that it should have less effect on the site-specific
problems.  It uses L-band co-polarization measurements to estimate snow density and
the underlaying surface dielectric and roughness properties.  Then, the backscattering
signals from the snow-ground interface at C- and X-band can be decomposed from the total
backscattering signals by estimation of the surface backscattering components from
the underlaying surface dielectric and roughness properties.  Finally, the snow depths
and snowpack equivalent particle sizes can be estimated from C- and X-band measurements.
This algorithm does not require a background image (without snow cover) so that the
problems due to mis-coregistration and the surface roughness properties change can
be avoided.  The current test results from two
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data takes over our Mammoth
test site showed the accuracies of 62 kg/m3, 38.1 cm and 19.8 cm for snow density,
depth, and water equivalence, respectively. Currently, we are testing this algorithm
over all data takes for dry snow cover at the Mammoth site.<BR>

Application of

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
to Hydrology<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Determine and compare soil moisture patterns within one or more humid watersheds using

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data, ground-based measurements, and hydrologic modeling.<BR>
<BR>
Use radar data to characterize the hydrologic regime within a catchment and to identify
the runoff producing characteristics of humid zone watersheds.<BR>
<BR>
Use radar data as the basis for scaling up from small scale, near-point process models
to larger scale water balance models necessary to define and quantify the land phase
of GCMs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
During the time since the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
missions, this project has received 13 processed

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
images from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
(April 11-18, 1994) of the primary hydrology supersite in
Chickasha, Oklahoma, as well as 10 X-SAR images  On three days, long strips (either
98 or 200 km) of the data takes covering the Washita watershed were also processed.
We have just now begun to receive processed scenes from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
mission in October,
with a total of 9 images logged in so far which cover a primary sampling site within
the Little Washita watershed.<BR>
<BR>
Data have also been received for the back up super site at Mahantango, PA.  We have
received the two scenes for April and three uncalibrated interferometric scenes from
the October mission.<BR>
<BR>
During both missions, and the week of the aborted August shuttle flight, extensive
ground data and aircraft data were collected at both the primary and secondary supersites.
The types and quantities of data collected at the two sites varied from mission
to mission but included extensive ground truth data (soil moisture, roughness, vegetation,
etc.), flux stations, radiosondes, weather stations, stream flow, and aircraft measurements
(C-130

vis-nir, and thermal).<BR>
<BR>
During the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
field experiment (April 6-16, 1994), field conditions were initially
dry, became wet as a result of a heavy rainstorm on the afternoon of 4/10/94 and
morning of 4/11/94, and then gradually dried down throughout the remainder of the
experimental period (a change in volumetric soil moisture of 15-20%). In contrast, during
the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
experiment (October 1-6, 1994), most of the watershed remained dry except
for localized rainfall in the northwest part of the watershed on the evening of 10/3/94
and in the northern part of the watershed on the evening of 10/4/94.<BR>
<BR>
Conditions at Mahantango in April were very wet with little change in soil moisture
between the two data takes.  During October, conditions were quite a bit better.
The area was initially dry for the first data take, followed by rain and a dry down
for the next standard data take and the consecutive days of the interferometric data takes.<BR>
<BR>
Estimation of soil moisture.   Initially we have focused on data collected on April
11, 12, and 15th. After registering the images, we made a land cover classification
that was needed for both the radar inversion models and the hydrological models.
The land cover classification combined the algorithm with classifications of urban, tall
vegetation, short vegetation and bare soil and the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NDVI">NDVI</a> 
estimation from a Thematic
Mapper image acquired April 1994. The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NDVI">NDVI</a> 
allows us to distinguish between active
short crops (like winter wheat) and pasture that is still in senescence.<BR>
<BR>
Following the classification, two estimation procedures were applied: an empirical,
regression similar to that described in Lin et al. (1994) and the inversion model
of Dubois et al. (1995). In addition, a distributed hydrological model was also used
to estimate soil moisture within the Little Washita for the April
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
mission period.<BR>
<BR>
We also cooperated with J. C. Shi of the University of California at Santa Barbara
(UCSB) to retrieve soil moisture from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data. Shi's approach is a combination
of the Integral Equation Model (IEM) and a statistical technique. Due to the complexity
of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IEM">IEM</a>, 
 Shi adopted the assumption that the random surface height is small and used
the Small Perturbation model to approximate
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IEM">IEM</a>. 
  The results from Shi's model for
an almost bare surface (a field with emerging corn and row structure) were quite
good, except for overestimates on two dry days, which may be attributed to the calibration
accuracy of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a>, 
 i.e., within 2 dB.  However, for the short vegetated fields, the
model tends to overestimate on dry days and underestimate on wet days. This may be
related to the Small Perturbation approximation of the model or to a vegetation attenuation
effect, although theoretical studies show that the attenuation is small at L band.<BR>
<BR>
Scaling of soil moisture.  This research has been initially carried out with remotely
sensed soil moisture collected during the Washita '92 field experiment. Results published
in Dubayah et al. (1995) indicate that the soil moisture exhibits multiscaling properties, namely log-log linearity of statistical moments as a function of scale,
and nonlinear dependence of scaling exponents with order moment.<BR>
<BR>
Truck radar experiments.  To complement the Shuttle radar data and provide an accurate
means of comparison of microwave data acquired at different spatial scales from different
platforms, NASA/GSFC's three-frequency, truck-mounted radar was deployed to the hydrology supersite near Chickasha during
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a>. 
 Designed and operated in conjunction
with George Washington University, the truck radar consists of L-, C-, and X-band
radars (1.6, 4.75, and 10 GHz) which approximate the L-, C-, and X-band radars on

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and the L- and C-radars on NASA/JPL's airborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
system. On each of eight days
of actual data collection the truck radar took measurements at three frequencies
(L, C, X), four polarizations 
   (<a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#HV">HV</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#VV">VV</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#VH">VH</a>) 
, and three angles (30, 40, 50 degrees)
for four test fields which each represented a typical surface cover found in the watershed
(pasture, alfalfa, new corn/bare, winter wheat). Calibrated field averages of truck
radar backscatter for each of these test fields have been compiled for L- and C-band
and are available for distribution; most of the X-band data were considered to be
marginal due to noise floor problems. Comparisons of truck radar,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a>, 
 and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 

L-band data indicate that for certain fields the three sensors were responding almost
identically to the soil moisture dry down (agreement generally to within 1 dB). In other
fields, there might be agreement in some channels but not in others (like vs. cross
polarization, for example). These differences are currently under investigation in
light of surface scattering, cross calibration, and viewing geometry considerations.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Cross-comparison of radar sensor response between the truck,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a>, 
 and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 

radars indicates a general agreement on the order of 1 dB for certain fields at L-band
(CVV for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a>) 
. For other fields and data channels there is a poorer match in sensor response which is currently under investigation.<BR>
<BR>
For a primary pasture test site measured by both
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and the truck radar, an LHH
radar sensitivity to soil moisture of 5-6 dB change in backscatter for a 11-12% change
in volumetric soil moisture was recorded.<BR>
<BR>
A soil moisture inversion procedure simplified from the Integral Equation Model produced
estimation errors of 2.8% volumetric soil moisture when applied to L-band
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 

and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data of the Little Washita watershed.<BR>
<BR>
An empirical algorithm based on scatterometer data has been developed for retrieving
soil moisture and the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#RMS">RMS</a> 
surface roughness.  The model has been tested using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 

and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data and the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#RMS">RMS</a> 
error in the soil moisture estimate was less than 3.5%.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Estimation of soil moisture.   We will continue to explore the role of radar data
for the estimation of soil moisture. Specifically, we plan to do the following research:<BR>
<BR>
(i) Extend the range of conditions for which
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data has been investigated to date.
This will be done by applying the same procedures used in Pauwels et al. (1995) to
the October 1994 field data. In addition, we have been collaborating with other
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 

soil moisture researchers in Italy and Belgium and anticipate a joint paper summarizing

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
soil estimation across a number of areas.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Test additional inversion algorithms, specifically J. C. Shi's and A. K. Fung's,
to the data collected at Chickasha. This work would be done in collaboration with

   <a href="Acronyms.html#GSFC">GSFC</a> 
and will provide important insights into the range of estimates provided by
radar inversion models.<BR>
<BR>
(iii) In conjunction with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
(J. van Zyl), we will continue to explore the usefulness
of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data for estimation of soil moisture at regional scales.
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
has extracted
an 800 km strip from the April 12 Chickasha ascending scene. We plan to do inter
comparisons between this radar data and rain radar data (to identify wet areas) and with
hydrological model derived soil moisture.<BR>
<BR>
(iv) The effect of moisture and surface roughness to surface scattering is nonlinear.
Instead of the current statistical approach of using polarization ratios to invert
soil moisture from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data, we will test a combination of neural network and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IEM">IEM</a>, 

a technique currently under development by A. K. Fung's group that we learned when
we attended
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IGARSS">IGARSS</a> 
in July. We will cooperate with A. K. Fung's students, K. S. Chen
and Y. C. Tseng, who now work at the Center for Space and Remote Sensing Research,
National Central University, Taiwan.<BR>
<BR>
Scaling soil moisture.  We plan to carry out similar scaling analyses with the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 

backscatter data and with derived soil moisture data. The objective of this work
is to determine a resolution appropriate for regional soil moisture estimation.
Extension of soil moisture estimation procedures from the scale of individual fields to the
scale of the entire watershed will be pursued in different ways including use of
a hydrological model for the watershed and comparison with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SSM/I">SSM/I</a> 
satellite microwave
data.  Processing of any
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SCANSAR">SCANSAR</a> 
data takes over the Little Washita watershed will be requested
in this regard.<BR>
<BR>
Active-Passive synergism.  Future research will include continuing development of
soil moisture inversion models utilizing
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data alone and also radar data in
combination with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ESTAR">ESTAR</a> 
passive microwave data and other remote sensing and meteorological
measurements.  Cross-calibration of sensor response for all mission conditions will be
a preliminary focus.<BR>
<BR>
Soil properties.  We also intend to try to use the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data sets to extract
information about the physical properties of the soils.  For this work, the relative
rate of change in soil moisture (drying) can be associated with the percents of sand, silt, and clay, and the two-day drying with the saturated hydraulic conductivity.<BR>
<BR>
Vegetation effects.  Based on our current work, one of our research plans for the
coming two years is to improve soil moisture retrieval algorithms with the goal of
removing vegetation effects.  This includes the following steps:<BR>
<BR>
(i)  We will extend the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IEM">IEM</a> 
term beyond the Small Perturbation approximation.  With
the application of neural networks, we hope it will improve the estimation of moisture
for sparse and short vegetated surfaces.  A second approach will be to apply a Rayleigh model to account for the attenuation effect of sparse and short vegetation when
generating a training data set for a neural network.<BR>
<BR>
(ii)  For dense and tall crops such as corn and fully grown winter wheat, the interactions
between the ground surface and the canopy should be accounted for when providing
a training data set to the neural network; existing vegetation scattering models
will be modified for this purpose.<BR>
<BR>
(iii)  A comparison of truck radar and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
results at C-band with radar data from

   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
over the Little Washita area on 4/12/94 (wet day) and 4/15/94 (dry day) will
be examined along with the L-band response to quantify vegetation effects through
a multifrequency approach.<BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
Analysis of Topography and Climate in the Central Andes<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Understand large-scale interactions between tectonic and climate-controlled erosional
processes that created the Andes.<BR>
<BR>
Determine the modern and Pleistocene snow-line altitudes and gradients in a poorly
known but critical latitude range of the central Andes, and interpret ice-age changes
in atmospheric circulation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Since the launch of the April mission our project has focused primarily on the analysis
of the enormous amount of new
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data for the Patagonian Icefields. The
North and South Patagonian Icefields represent 62% of the glacial area in the southern
hemisphere outside of Antarctica, with the South Patagonian Icefield (SPI) ranking
as the third largest ice mass on Earth after Antarctica and Greenland. Although little
studied, these glaciers are some of the most dynamic in the world, with annual precipitation exceeding 7 m in the accumulation areas and ablation rates as high as 6 cm/day
at sea level, allowing them to respond quickly to climatic variations. Monitoring
the response of these glaciers is important for the study of the regional climate
as well as the relationships between climate changes in the northern and southern hemispheres.
The new radar data will have a major impact on the understanding of these important
icefields and glaciers.<BR>
<BR>
Radar interferometry analysis of the San Rafael glacier, one of the fastest moving
glaciers in the world, has produced spectacular results revealing new information
regarding its flow characteristics.  The extremely fast velocities at the terminus
are not characteristic throughout its length and slow down by an order of magnitude up glacier.
Within the interior of the icefield the glacier acts as a well defined ice stream
with slower moving ice on its flanks.<BR>
<BR>
Analysis of the Patagonian
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data has lead us to new discoveries regarding
the spatial and temporal characterization of snow and ice conditions on the Patagonian
Icefields, and has demonstrated the utility of combining multitemporal
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
with meteorological and hydrological data to detect the effects of synoptic weather systems
and seasonal changes on snow and ice conditions.<BR>
<BR>
The Patagonian results have spawned collaborations with the Chilean and Japanese glaciologists
who have been responsible for much of the previous research on the icefields.  We
are planning to conduct a joint field trip with them to measure ice depth profiles and snow and ice conditions on the San Rafael glacier.  The ice depth measurements
will be made with an ice penetrating radar and are needed in order to use the ice
velocity measurements to calculate ice flux and test models of glacier flow.<BR>
<BR>
In April 1995 we received our first four
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TOPSAR">TOPSAR</a> 
scenes processed through the new
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 

integrated processor.  These four scenes cover two glacier sites in the Cordillera
Real, Bolivia and the Quelccaya Ice Cap, Peru.  The focus of our recent research
has been to assess the usefulness of this data for glaciological studies, especially as
a high resolution data source for detection of glacier change.  We are collaborating
with researchers at the Unidad de Glaciology Recursos Hedricos de Electroperu to
use
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TOPSAR">TOPSAR</a> 
data to update the glacial inventory of the Cordillera Blanca which was originally
done using aerial photographs taken in the 1950s and 60s.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Spaceborne Imaging Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) Glaciological Observations of the Patagonian
Icefields<BR>
<BR>
A mosaic of the North Patagonian Icefield and the northern half of the South Patagonian
Icefield (SPI) is being constructed from the 14
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
scenes acquired during
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a>. 

Because of the persistent cloud cover this is the first complete mosaic of the icefields since a series of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TM">TM</a> 
acquisitions in 1986.  Terminus position changes of 15
glaciers are determined and the spatial distribution of these changes correlated
with glacier characteristics including aspect, area, length, accumulation area/ablation
area ratio, equilibrium line altitude (ELA) and gradient.  Snowlines are mapped and compared
to previous estimates of ELAs.  Several ice divides on the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPI">SPI</a> 
are defined for the
first time.  Other previously undetected glacial features include: buried crevasses,
small icefalls, and ogives.  The complete set of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
data provides  a comprehensive
view of seasonal change for the northern
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPI">SPI</a>. 
<BR>
<BR>
Snow and Ice Conditions inferred from Scattering Mechanism Decomposition of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

images of the Patagonian Icefields<BR>
<BR>
The scattering mechanism decomposition technique of Cloude, modified for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data
by van Zyl and Rignot, is used to interpret the snow and ice conditions of the Patagonian
Icefields.  Several large areas on the icefields are dominated by a double bounce
scattering mechanism which has never been reported for a snow and ice target.  We
presently interpret this to be the result of subsurface refrozen ice on a 5 cm scale.
Inverse backscatter modeling together with the limited published field data will
be used to constrain the physical parameters of the snow and ice such as: grain size distribution,
snow wetness, density, surface roughness and the orientation and structure of subsurface
refrozen ice.  We hope to further constrain the snow and ice parameters with our own measurements from snow pits on the Patagonian Icefields.<BR>
<BR>
Ice Velocity and Surface Topographic Mapping of the Moreno Glacier area of the South
Patagonian Icefield from Spaceborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
interferometry<BR>
<BR>
Interferometric analysis similar to that done on the San Rafael Glacier will be applied
to the fast-moving Moreno Glacier and several slower glaciers in the area.  The glaciers
in the southern portion of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPI">SPI</a> 
act as a coalescence of individual glaciers rather than outlet glaciers draining a common icefield as they do on the NPI, therefore,
comparisons of the velocity and strain maps of this area with those of the San Rafael
area will illustrate the differences in flow characteristics of these two glacial regimes.<BR>
<BR>

Results from San Rafael Glacier Field Experiments<BR>
<BR>
If we are successful in obtaining ice depth profiles and characterizing the snow and
ice conditions on San Rafael Glacier during our planned trip to Chile then we will
be in the position to provide important ground validation results for both the San
Rafael interferometry results (Rignot, et al., 1995) and the Patagonian radar glacier zones
(Forster and Isacks, 1995).<BR>
<BR>
Mapping of Glacial Geomorphology in the Cordillera Real, Bolivia with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

images<BR>
<BR>
Various geomorphic features are easily identifiable on the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
images that
are not as evident on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VNIR">VNIR</a> 
images.  The extent of Pleistocene glaciation can be mapped
from moraine positions prominently displayed on the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images because of the enhancement of subtle topography  to the side-looking geometry.  Rock glaciers, talus and
bedrock outcrops can be distinguished through the variations in surface roughness.<BR>
<BR>
A comparison of DEMs generated from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
interferometry and  stereo pairs in the Cordillera
Real, Bolivia<BR>
<BR>
We have a unique opportunity to compare DEMs generated from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TOPSAR">TOPSAR</a> 
interferometry,

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPOT">SPOT</a> 
stereo pairs, and from aerial photograph stereo pairs for an area with extreme
relief for which we also have good ground control from 1:50,000 maps.  This will serve as a test for the accuracy and coverage of a spaceborne interferometer in
the presence of large topographic variations.<BR>
<BR>
Himalayan Radar Glacier Zones observed with SIR-C/X-SAR<BR>
<BR>
We will apply our interpretation of the Patagonian radar glacier zones to the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

data acquired over the Himalayan Glaciers.  The climatic setting in the Himalayans
is dominated by monsoonal and winter precipitation as opposed to the year-round precipitation in Patagonia.  We anticipate this to be reflected in the spatial and temporal
distribution of the radar glacier zones.  The seasonal changes induced by the 1994
monsoon season (mid-summer) should be recorded by the differences in the April and
October radar glacier zones.  Analysis of the radar zones will not be limited to relatively
flat areas (as they were in Patagonia) because we can correct the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data for radiometric
and geometric topographic influences with the high resolution
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 
available at Cornell.<BR>
<BR>
A multitemporal analysis of the Radar Glacier Zones in Patagonia and British Columbia
with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
and SIR-C/X-SAR<BR>
<BR>
Based on the Patagonian radar glacier zones defined from our
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
analysis
we are observing those zones as shown by  C-VV from a continuing series of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 

and 2
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
acquisitions of the Patagonian Icefields and British Columbia. These images
are correlated with elevation of the snow and ice surfaces and with weather conditions to
determine the dynamics of climate/glacier interactions over time scales of synoptic
weather to seasonal change.<BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#TOPSAR">TOPSAR</a> 
Data for Bolivia and Southern Peru<BR>
<BR>
Our research has focused primarily on assessing the geometric accuracy of the data
to determine if it can be used as part of a glaciological time series.  Glacier boundaries
are clearly discernible on the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
imagery and can be easily mapped.  Rectification of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TOPSAR">TOPSAR</a> 
data to other datasets is more problematic.  The glacier recession that
has occurred in the region over the past 30-40 years is measured in 10's of meters,
so accurate coregistration is required. The small footprint of a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TOPSAR">TOPSAR</a> 
scene has
hindered coregistration simply because there is often a limited number of good ground control
points that can be used to accurately define the transform.  In an attempt to improve
coregistration we have begun to focus on better visualization of the radar imagery.  We have also recently begun to integrate
   <a href="Acronyms.html#TOPSAR">TOPSAR</a> 
digital elevation data with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 

imagery to create stereo radar imagery.  This combination has resulted in dramatically
improved visualization of radar data. It offers several advantages over even geocorrected data in mountainous regions.  First and foremost it allows radar backscatter
signatures to be seen in their true landscape position.  This is crucial for proper
interpretation of geomorphic features such as moraines or debris left by retreating
glaciers as well as accurate mapping of the position of glacier termini.  Secondly, it allows
much better registration with other datasets as ground control points become much
easier to identify.  Lastly,  It also allows radar imagery to be used by a much wider
community.  Nonradar scientists can find using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data, especially in mountainous
regions, a frustrating task as layover and foreshortening render the landscape nearly
unrecognizable.  However, through the creation of stereopairs, radar data is presented
in a form identical to widely used aerial photographs that researchers, even in underdeveloped
countries, are familiar working with.  We intend to use this technique with the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 

that will be created for the Cordillera, Real region using SLR-2 data as well.<BR>

The Joint Analyses of Single- and Dual-Frequency/Experimental Dual-Polarization
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 

and X-SAR Measurements in Precipitation<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Determine the vertical and horizontal spatial distribution of hydrometeors in precipitating
clouds.<BR>
<BR>
Measure the spatial distribution of liquid water and ice in the clouds.<BR>
<BR>
Measure and determine the limits of measurement of the polarization characteristics
related to the shapes and orientations of hydrometeors in precipitating clouds.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
In spite of the severe constraint allowing only four nadir rolls during each mission,
we were able to collect limited data on one occasion through a rainband of Typhoon
Odille, on the first mission (Fig. 1), and much better data over tropical cyclone
Seth, on two occasions during the second mission (Fig. 2). Although we apparently lost
the best data take because of an error in the setting of radar parameters by the
operations center, we did end up apparently with one good data take through intense
convection and surrounding stratiform precipitation.  This alone is a remarkable achievement
with an estimated likelihood of success of less than 0.1% because of the spatial
and temporal variability of the precipitation and limited (8) number of Shuttle nadir
rolls during the two missions. We feel very lucky indeed and appreciate the hard work at
the operations center to make sure we got these data takes.<BR>
<BR>
While the focus of this research is on nadir data, other observations off-nadir through
rain clouds were also collected. Several instances of these were processed first.
While
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
side-looking images of rainstorms are interesting qualitatively, they are
not very useful for quantitative studies because of the large vertical extent of the
radar beam and because the geometry of the observations precludes unambiguous interpretation
of the data. It is for these reasons that our primary concern here is with the nadir data. However, the request for these data from the second mission was at the
bottom of the processing heap so that we are just now getting access to our
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 

data and are still awaiting the X-SAR data. A preliminary inspection of the qualitative
nature of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data are, nevertheless, encouraging and warrant detailed quantitative
analyses.<BR>
<BR>
In particular these data include a transition from convective to stratiform precipitation
clearly exhibiting a 'bright-band' associated with the melting layer (Fig. 2). The
region of convection is well suited to a dual-frequency (C-band and X-band) analysis for the quantitative estimation of rainfall. The software for rainfall estimation
is ready as demonstrated in Fig. 1.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, while waiting for access to the nadir data, we have made good use of
the time by using ancillary data and performing theoretical studies of benefit to
the upcoming analyses. In particular, an analysis of JPL/NASA
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ARMAR">ARMAR</a> 
(Airborne Rain
Mapping Radar) data collected at nadir shows that in heavier rain, the larger raindrops are
oscillating leading to the generation of linear depolarization (LDR) (Jameson and
Durden 1996). This not only has significant implications for ground-based polarization
measurements of precipitation but could also prove to be a useful new method for detecting
heavy rainfall from space. We will be looking for this signature in the upcoming
analysis of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data. Moreover, the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ARMAR">ARMAR</a> 
data clearly show enhanced
   <a href="Acronyms.html#LDR">LDR</a> 
associated with the melting level. Knowing the altitude of this melting level is important
in order to accurately retrieve rainfall measurements from space using either radar
or radiometers or a combination of the two technologies. These two features are illustrated in Fig. 3.<BR>
<BR>
Of much greater importance, perhaps, is a theoretical result having quite general
applicability to many types of radar, scatterometer, radiometric, and other types
of measurements.  Since at nadir we use the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
as a real aperture radar, we were
interested in the smoothing effects of the beam as well as the signal statistics of a spaceborne
radar passing through rapidly changing meteorological conditions. While investigating
this situation, we (see Jameson and Kostinski 1996) found the general result for
any instrument scanning through regions where the mean is changing while sampling,
that the amplitudes, in general, are not Rayleigh distributed, as illustrated in
Fig. 4.<BR>
<BR>
Consequently, the distributions of the intensities are not, in general, negative exponential.
This effect can lead to bias for some detectors (linear and logarithmic) and, more
importantly, can significantly increase the uncertainty of the estimate of, say, the mean intensity at times and locations where conditions are changing rapidly.
Moreover, it is shown that the beam filtering effect extends over twice the beam
width (for one estimate per beam width) thus considerably broadening the storm boundaries
and dimensions unless 'block' scanning is used.  Fortunately, the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
nadir
data are optimum in the sense that these problems are minimized.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
We anticipate accessing nadir data collected on data take 103 in mid-September and
will then request multiple polarization and multiple frequency data through interesting
segments. We should have these data within two months so that we can perform detailed quantitative analyses in November and December. The analysis software is ready (see
Fig. 1) and simply requires getting the data.  We hope to have a manuscript ready
by the end of January 1996.<BR>
<BR>
The first stage will be the processing and analysis of C-band data, especially looking
for the melting layer and for enhanced
   <a href="Acronyms.html#LDR">LDR</a> 
in heavier rain. The second stage will
be combining the C-band and X-SAR data to deduce a profile of rain through deep convection. This will be a first, if successful, and should generate one to two publications.
Finally, in the future, we would like to scan side-looking cloud images in order
to look for unusual data for possible analysis. These will have to be primarily at
small look angles in order to reduce the mixing of ground and rain signals. This may lead
to additional publications, depending on what is uncovered.<BR>

High Alpine
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
Experiment<BR>
<BR>
<BR>


<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
The High Alpine
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
Experiment is aimed at the development of methods and the demonstration
of applications of multifrequency polarimetric
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
for investigations of high alpine
environment with emphasis on snow and glacier applications. The main activities, including extensive field campaigns and data analysis, were related to the test
site &Ouml;tztal in the Central Alps of Austria which had been selected as
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

supersite for snow hydrology and glaciology. Complementary investigations on snow
applications were carried out in the region near Innsbruck, where different snow types than
at the high alpine site &Ouml;tztal were observed during
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
in April 1994. Valuable
glaciological information was derived from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data also for Viedma Glacier
and Moreno Glacier of the Southern Patagonian Icefield. On Moreno Glacier the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PI">PI</a> 
is leading
a glaciological research project involving field measurements and satellite data
analysis.<P>
<P>


<strong>PROGRESS<P></strong>
<P>
During the two
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
missions
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
(9 to 20 April 1994) and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
(30 September
to 10 October 1994) extensive field measurements were carried out on glaciers and
on ice-free parts of the test site. The measurements included:<P>
During both
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and SRL-2:<BR>
- deployment and geodetic measurement of corner reflectors (1.25 to 1.8 m leg length)
on glaciers,<BR>
- measurement of snow depth, density, grain size, dielectric constant, stratification,
temperature in snow pits,<BR>
-  surface roughness profiles of snow and ice,<BR>

Measurements throughout the year:<BR>
- hourly mean runoff of two basins in the central part of the test site,<BR>
- ice ablation and accumulation for determination of glacier mass balance,<BR>
- meteorological stations.<BR>
<BR>


During
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
the glaciers were covered by dry winter snow, the air temperature at
3000 m was below -10&#176; C,
 and snowfall was observed during several days.  At lower
elevations the
snow-structure was more complex, and the snowpack was partly humid. During
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
the
meteorological conditions changed drastically; the mean daily air temperature dropped
by 12&#176; C during the campaign, 
resulting in significant changes of snow properties
and backscattering signatures on the glaciers.<BR>
<BR>


All data, which had been acquired over the test site, were processed and delivered.
We obtained the following scenes:<P>

Polarimetric signatures and frequency dependence of backscattering of snow cover,
glaciers, and ice-free areas, including vegetated and un-vegetated terrain, were
investigated and related to field data of target properties.  The analysis included
investigations of angular behavior of backscattering properties and studies of temporal changes.
Significant short-term changes were observed over snow and ice during
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
at X-
and C-band, whereas the seasonal changes in snow and ice properties resulted in pronounced backscattering differences between
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
at all 3 frequencies. Supervised
and unsupervised methods were applied for classification, based on various combinations
of backscattering parameters.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<P></strong>
- During both
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
a near real time analysis was carried out over glaciers
to determine the accumulation and ablation areas and estimate glacier mass balance.<BR>
<BR>
- The signature analysis clearly demonstrates the importance of multifrequency and polarimetric
data for separating different snow and ice regimes on glaciers and for mapping accumulation
and ablation areas. L- or C-band co- and cross-polarized channels in combination with X-band were found to be of main importance for this application.<BR>
<BR>
- The maps of accumulation and ablation areas, derived from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a>, 

show low ratios of accumulation to ablation areas, and consequently significant loss
of mass during summer 1994 for all glaciers of the &Ouml;tztaler Alpen. Good agreement
was found for the mass balance estimated from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
data in comparison with field
measurements, carried out on two glaciers in the test site for the period 1 October
1993 to 30 September 1994.<BR>

Snow Studies in the Innsbruck Region<BR>
<BR>
The region surrounding Innsbruck was covered by the same swathes of the ascending
orbits as the test site &Ouml;tztal. During
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
the mountain slopes above Innsbruck
were covered by humid snow, an intense snowfall event was observed between
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DT">DT</a> 
46.1
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DT">DT</a> 
78.0. This enables studies of different snow conditions than at the high alpine site.
Snow properties and soil humidity were measured in the field.<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a>

Glacier Studies on the Southern Patagonian Icefield<BR>
<CITE><BR>
</CITE>
Glaciological and geodetic measurements have been made on two of the main glaciers,
Viedma Glacier and Moreno Glacier, of the Southern Patagonian Icefield which were
imaged by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a>. 
 Because emphasis of field activities during
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 

was on the test site &Ouml;tztal, the campaigns in Patagonia could not be carried out during the
shuttle flights. Nevertheless, the information obtained in the field during the campaigns
listed below, is of great importance for the analysis of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data.<BR>
<BR>
Measurements on Viedma Glacier (22 to 27 Feb. 1994):<BR>
-
   <a href="Acronyms.html#GPS">GPS</a> 
measurements of ground control points along the glacier boundary,<BR>
- documentation of surface roughness in the ablation area, including the volcanic ash
bands,<BR>
- collecting of ash samples and pumice stones from the ash bands on the glacier.<BR>
Measurements on Moreno Glacier (1 to 6 March 1994):<BR>
- measurement of ice motion and ablation at 4 stakes which had been drilled in  Nov. 1993.<BR>
Measurements on Moreno Glacier (14 to 30 November 1995):<BR>
- drilling of 19 stakes (10 m to 12 m deep) at various locations on the glacier, including
a  transverse profile (11 stakes) situated 10 km above the glacier terminus,<BR>
- measurement of the geodetic position of the stakes by means of differential 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#GPS">GPS</a>, 
<BR>
-
   <a href="Acronyms.html#GPS">GPS</a> 
measurements of ground control points along the glacier boundary,<BR>
- installation of an automatic meteorological station at the glacier terminus.<BR>
<BR>
Further field campaigns are planned on Moreno Glacier in March 1996 and November 1996.
The planned activities include re-measurement of stakes to determine ice motion and
ablation,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#GPS">GPS</a> 
measurements of glacier boundaries, ice thickness measurements along
the transverse profile, echo-sounding of the lake depth in front of the glacier.<BR>

The boundaries of Viedma Glacier and of the glacier dammed lake <CITE>Laguna Viedma</CITE>
were mapped from the X-SAR data. Extent and melting conditions of snow and ice areas
on the glacier were investigated. Interferometric analysis was carried out for the
region of Moreno Glacier, for X-SAR and L-band
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data.<BR>
<BR>
- A major change of the glacier dammed lake <CITE>Laguna Viedma</CITE>
was found by comparing the X-SAR images from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a>. 
  The lake area decreased
from 5.5 km<sup>2</sup> in April 1994 to 1.5 km<sup>2</sup> in October 1995 and the water level lowered considerably.  This outbreak of the
lake, after a long period of comparatively stable glacier position, may indicate
changing climatic conditions and the start of a major glacier retreat.<BR>
<BR>
- Good interferograms were obtained on Moreno Glacier from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
L-band data although
the glacier surface was melting.  No coherency was obtained over the glacier in the
X-SAR data, because backscattering at the shorter wavelengths is more affected by
melting. Ice velocities from the L-band interferogram show good agreement with the velocities
measured in the field.  From the interferogram a map of ice motion can be generated
over the whole glacier terminus, most parts of which are inaccessible due to crevasses.  Interesting features of the ice motion, including a secondary maximum of
velocity just above the calving front, have been identified which had not been known
so far.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
- Improvements of target classification and characterization in high Alpine regions,
including glaciers and ice-free areas.<p>
- Test of feasibility and accuracy of inversion procedures for snow wetness and for
dry snow using the &Ouml;tztal data set. The inversion procedures, which have been developed
for the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data of Mammoth by J.C. Shi, will be applied.<p>
- Studies of ice dynamic of Moreno Glacier, based on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
interferometry and on field
data. In addition to the campaign in Nov. 1995, the field activities planned for
1996 (ice thickness, motion, glacier boundaries) are of great significance for this
task.<p>
- Studies of morphologic characteristics and flow features of Viedma Glacier based on

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR data in combination with

The Orgeval
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
Experiment in April 1994 <BR>
<BR>

The area surveyed by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
included two monitored watersheds, M&eacute;larchez and
Orgeval, covering 5x5 km<sup>2</sup>
 of intensive agricultural plains east of Paris (France).  In April 94, the majority
of fields were bare soils, except for wheat (20 cm high).  During the 5 days of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 

passes, soil moisture remained high and constant 
(0.35cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>) 
over the watersheds and soil roughness and practices were the remaining variables.<BR>
<BR>
A detailed survey was done and a crop map generated (70 fields of more of one ha)
shown on Figure 1. Photography of soil surfaces was done over 50 bare fields.  Ten
fields (numbered one to 10) were intensively characterized and were representative
of the region's cultures (four of wheat, two of peas, three of corn, one ploughed field):
soil moisture and density data (gravimetric and neutronic), height profiles by pin-profilers,
penetrometer.  A
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPOT">SPOT</a> 
image (from June 1994 ) was used to assess the field boundaries.  The 70 fields were classified by roughness aspects (Table 1).<BR>
<BR>
The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images' incidence angles range from 
44&#176;
  to 
57&#176;.
 Simultaneously, several flights
of the copolar scatterometer
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERASME">ERASME</a> 
of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#CETP">CETP</a> 
( C- and X-bands ) were done in
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 

site direction and over the tested region, keeping flights perpendicular 
and parallel to the row directions over test fields. The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERASME">ERASME</a> 
incidence
 angles were from 
25&#176;
to 
50&#176;.
<BR>
<BR>
Intercomparison of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
cross-sections was done over natural targets, on fields
seen on the same incidence angle and the same view azimuthal angle.  The intercalibration
of the three radars was within 2 dB at maximum (Figures 2 and 3).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Polarimetric signatures in multiconfiguration conditions (three frequencies, L, C,
X, multi-incidence, and polarization ) were studied, following two approaches: <BR>
<BR>
- a global analysis of the ability of L- and C-band to discriminate (thanks to unsupervised
classification algorithms) the  polarimetric  signatures of  different land  cover
types, for  crop map elaboration in an early stage of plant growth.<BR>
<BR>
- the test  of  existing models of backscattering  over  agricultural  surfaces  and
the appro- priateness of surface descriptions.<BR>
<BR>
Mono-Band and Multi-Band Classification<BR>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
First, unsupervised mono-band mono-incidence classifications were performed on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a> 

and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HV">HV</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
images.  Cluster characteristics were determined using the fuzzy c-means
algorithm and then images were classified according to the Maximum A Posterior criterion.  The numbers of clusters were four for C-band classification and six for L-band
classification.  Then identification rates of the main cover land types were computed.
For each of the four land cover types: forest, wheat, ploughed land and seedling,
figure 4 shows the C-band and figure 5 shows the L-band identification rates versus incidence
angle, and the classification algorithm used: supervised (called &quot;svs&quot;) or unsupervised
(called &quot;nsvs&quot;), blind (subscript &quot;0&quot;) or MAP (subscript &quot;1&quot;). The main results are:<BR>
<BR>
a- regularization step (MAP classification) reduces classification errors;<BR>
b- L-band performs better in soil cover type discrimination than C-band;<BR>
c- identification rates in C-band increase with incidence angle (between 44&#176;  and 57&#176; );<BR>
d- ploughed land identification in L-band decreases with incidence angle.<BR>
<BR>
Then, complementarity and redundancy between L- and C-bands were studied in a quantitative
way. Figure 6 shows the redundancy rate (mutual information normalized by the image
entropy) between L- and C-band unsupervised classification results, versus incidence angle.  We found that redundancy increases when incidence angle increases between
44&#176;  and 57&#176; .  However at an incidence angle of 57&#176; , redundancy between L- and C-band
is only about 30%.<BR>
<BR>
Recalling that, in C-band, land cover identification rates are not as good as in L-band,
but increase with incidence angle, we may assume that the increase of redundancy
between L- and C-band versus incidence angle is mainly due to the increase of &quot;useful&quot; information (which is probably due to increase of contrast or reduction of speckle
noise) in C-band images.<BR>
<BR>
FInally, data fusion between L- and C-band was performed to improve identification
rates.  The aim of data fusion is to use redundancy between images to reduce classification
errors and to use complementarity to put in evidence new classes. The unsupervised multi-source classification algorithm used is based on Dempster-Shafer evidence
theory.  Figure 7 shows the identification rates obtained after data fusion, and
improvement in identification of land cover types clearly appears. <BR>
<BR>
The conclusion is that multi-band L and C can be successfully used to discriminate
the different land cover types.  Similar results were obtained with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data for
discrimination of the different culture types in Summer 1991.<BR>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
Backscattering modeling and surface description<BR>
<BR>
The main results are:<BR>
<BR>
- There is a systematic  azimuthal dependence of copolar radar cross sections 
   (<a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a>, 


   <a href="Acronyms.html#VV">VV</a>) 
  over the same field with the view angle towards the row direction in C- and
X-bands, as  well  for  smooth  fields of  peas  eroded by rains and for  rough
ploughed  fields. It  is  obtained by complementary view angles of targets with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERASME">ERASME</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

or
with fields  of  very  similar  roughness seen  by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
 for smooth fields.
The  mean  difference  between  perpendicular  and parallel direction  is about
2 dB, which is  large compared to dielectric constant variations occurring between
dry and  moist  soils  (Figure 8).  Points are from fields with incidence  angles between
25 to 57&#176; .   In L-band  the restricted number of cases prevents any conclusions.<BR>
<BR>
- The complementary use of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERASME">ERASME</a> 
scatterometer and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
allows study  in
copolarization of the variation of radar cross sections with incidence angle.  Over
the  10  test  fields, the  surface roughness  parameters  are deduced from  pin
profiler  data,  parallel and perpendicular to rows and  using the Shin  and Kong's 1984
quasi  periodic  description of agricultural soils.  Small spatial scale (clods)
and large  (rows) parameters  are  summed in Table 2  and localized in  ks/kl space
(k the wave number, s the r.m.s. h eights, l the length of correlation at small scale)
on Figure 9. In L-band, all test fields are  within
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IEM">IEM</a> 
validity range.  In C-band,
only smooth  ones (peas) are within. Most  other  ploughed fields are  out of  range.
Field W3 is  taken  for  eroded  smooth  soil, W2  for  smooth ones, and C9 for ploughed
ones, remaining within
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IEM">IEM</a> 
limits.<BR>
<BR>
Results of the comparison between
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IEM">IEM</a> 
simulations and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERASME">ERASME</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data are
shown  on Figures 10 and 11:<BR>
<BR>
- There is  in L-band  a good agreement for smooth fields and a 5-dB gap underestimation
by the model for the rough one.<BR>
<BR>
- The agreement in C-band remains good for smooth fields between 25 to 40&#176; .  For larger
incidence  angles  (40&#176;  to 57&#176; ), there is a  systematic  overestimation of  the
model.   It  is  more  pronounced  in  X-band  where  cross  sections  keep  decreasing  with  incidence  angle, even on the rougher C9  surface (-15 dB from  
25&#176;  to 57&#176; ),
as the model  gives a   flat response.<BR>
<BR>
To explain these differences, they must be analyzed in two directions, the physical
hypothesis of backscattering model, and also the adequacy of the surface used in
them. For smooth ones, the surface remains a randomly quasi-sinusoidal surface, with
a short range of spatial frequencies to describe it.  For very rough soils, surfaces become
discontinuous and other scattering models have to be considered, and soil-description
parameters to be defined.<BR>
<BR>

Surface Scattering Process<BR>
<BR>
The following activities are proposed.<BR>
<BR>
- Over  rough  surfaces, a  PHD  has   begun  in   1995  to  define   a new  description
of discontinuous surfaces and modeling in intensity in co- and cross-polarizations.
This work gathers at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#CETP">CETP</a> 
the remote sensing team of Dr. D. Vidal-Madjar and the
team of Pr  Lavergnat on Theoretical Electromagnetism.  Various ground surfaces are
studied and analyzed by geometrical image algorithms in collaboration with Dr. P.

M. Chapron of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ENSEA">ENSEA</a> 
(Ecole Nationale Superieure de l'Electronique et de ses Applications).<BR>
<BR>
- The quantification of azimuthal dependence of cross sections with rows. Two approaches
are foreseen.  The first one by analysis of surface description with a larger frequency
spectrum.  The second one by analysis of different databases, obtained over &quot;Pays de Caux&quot; in 1995 with a large multiplicity of radar configurations and completed
by the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
Orgeval campaign.  A polarimetric campaign over bare soils is
forecasted in 1997 with the two scatterometers of

<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Data Acquisition and Analysis<BR>
<BR>
Our test site is at the Little Washita watershed near Chickasha, Oklahoma, about 60
km southwest of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  During the first mission, a total of eleven
passes over the test site were made between April 11-17, 1994.  In the second mission, only nine passes over the test site were made between October 2-7, 1994, because
the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
operation was switched to the interferometry mode in the last three days
of the mission.  All the data acquired from the first mission have been processed
by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>, 
 and delivered to us for analysis.  There are a total of 11 passes, 5 ascending and
6 descending passes.  One of the passes was acquired in the wrong mode, and four
others belong to passes with high incidence angles  of 50 degrees, which are not
optimal for soil moisture estimation.  Data from the remaining six passes with incidence angles
between 28-50 degrees have been used for studying the temporal variations of soil
moisture in the watershed.  We have also begun to receive the processed data from
the second mission in October 1994.  The X-SAR data from the first mission were also requested
and we have received most of them.  These data will help classify vegetation cover
and improve soil moisture estimation from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
L-band data.<BR>
<BR>
During both missions, ground truth data of soil moisture and surface roughness were
collected for a number of selected fields in the watershed.  All the soil samples
have been processed and ready for
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data analysis.  Survey of the vegetation
cover was also made on about 70% of the entire test site - this information could be
combined with the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPOT">SPOT</a> 
image to validate classification of vegetation from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

data.  In addition, there were 43 rain gauges distributed quite uniformly over the
entire watershed roughly about 20 km by 40 km in area, which might be useful for comparing
with the soil moisture distribution estimated from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data.<BR>
<BR>
We emphasize analysis of the data acquired from the first mission, because there was
a moderate rainfall of about 2 cm over the entire watershed at the beginning of the
mission on April 10-11 and no rain throughout the rest of the mission.  The scenario
provides a chance to look at the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
response to the drying-down at the watershed.
During the second mission there was no significant rainfall in the test area, and
most of the region was dry to begin with; so we do not expect to see the change in
the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
signatures due to soil moisture.<BR>
<BR>


Retrieval Algorithms<BR>
<BR>
Most of previous studies on radar measurements of soil moisture dealt with the forward
problem, i.e., the examination of correlation between radar backscattter and soil
moisture.  Only in recent years were there attempts to invert the measured radar
parameters to soil moisture.  Currently, there are three different algorithms reported in
the literature for inversion of L-band
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
measurements to surface soil moisture,
all of them dealing with bare soils with surface roughness and soil moisture as retrieved
parameters.  The first of them is developed by the University of Michigan group (Oh
et al., 1992) based on the ground-based scatterometer measurements over bare fields
with different surface roughness.  The algorithm makes use of the ratios of measured
backscattering coefficients 

<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup>vv,
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup>hh,
and 
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup>hv

at L-band to estimate both soil moisture and surface roughness.  The second algorithm
is also empirical and developed by Pascale et al. (1995).  It is based on the same
scatterometer data set acquired by Oh et at. (1992) and
 uses only the measured 

<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup>vv,
and  
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup>hh

at L-band for the estimation of soil moisture and surface roughness.  The third
algorithm, developed by Shi et al. (1995), is based on a theoretical model for radar
backscattering from bare soils.  It can select any pair of quad-polarization measurements from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
or
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
measurements at L-band and make estimation of soil moisture
and surface roughness.  All three algorithms have been tested with the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data
and the results are summarized in the next section.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>


<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
When the algorithm of Oh et al. was applied to the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
L-band data for estimation
of soil moisture and surface roughness, difficulty arose because of the incomparability
between the measured ratios 

<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup>hh
/
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup>vv
and 
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup>hv
/
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup>vv.

  This is due to the fact that the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
measured s hv values are generally about
3-4 db higher than those measured by the University of Michigan ground-based scatterometer
system.  As a consequence, only a few percent of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
pixels fall in the category that the algorithm could provide a normal solution.  This difficulty is not shared
by the other two algorithms.  These results have been reported recently (Wang et
al., 1995).  In general, the soil moisture distribution estimated from either Dubois
et al.'s (1994) or Shi et al.'s algorithm over the period of April 11-17 shows a drying
down sequence as expected.  A comparison between the estimated soil moisture values
and those concurrently measured on the ground, however, shows that the algorithm
of Shi et al. gives very good estimation of soil moisture only for bare soils, while the
algorithm of Dubois et al. appears to be applicable to fields with short vegetation
cover as well.  The main reason for this difference is most likely due to the fact
that the algorithm of Dubois et al. deals strictly with 
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup>'s, 
while the algorithm of Shi et al. makes use of the phase information too; the
contribution from vegetation may have overshadowed that from soil moisture.<BR>
<BR>


When applying both algorithms of Dubois et al. and Shi et al. to the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
L-band
data for soil moisture estimation, it was found that a substantial number of pixels
could not have a normal solution, and this number appeared to be higher on drier
days.  These pixels are typically characterized by 

<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup>vv
<=
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup>hh.

To avoid this from happening some averaging procedure would have to be applied
to the data and the spatial resolution of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
measurements would suffer as
a result.  We are in the process of writing up an article for journal publication.
The article will present the first
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
results of soil moisture estimation over the Little
Washita Watershed and discuss the problems associated with the retrieval algorithms.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>


<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
We will attempt to perform a classification of vegetation cover, using the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

data, for the Little Washita Watershed.  This step is needed for soil moisture work,
because more than 80% of the watershed is covered with vegetation.  In addition,
the problem encountered in the estimation of soil moisture discussed above could also
be associated with the presence of vegetation.  For fields covered with vegetation
or wooded areas, 

<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup>vv

values could be close to or even smaller than those of 

<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif" alt="[Sigma]"><sup>0</sup>hh.

<BR>
<BR>


We will modify the currently available algorithms for estimation of soil moisture
over vegetated areas.  Most likely, this will be done empirically because the theoretical
models for different vegetation types are too complicated and may not be practical
for our main objective.  We hope to come up with a soil moisture map to cover more
than 80% of the watershed.<BR>

Differential Radar Interferometry<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Test differential radar interferometry as a new monitoring technique for remote sensing
of a forest site, a farm site, and a desert site.<BR>
<BR>
Generate topographic maps of test sites from radar data.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Fort Irwin Site<BR>
<BR>
We have acquired L- and C-band, single look, complex images of the Fort Irwin area
on three successive days of the second
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
flight.  The repeat-pass navigation
was superb, resulting in interferometer baselines with perpendicular components of
66 m and 28 m.<BR>
<BR>
The C-band interferogram enabled us to produce a digital elevation map accurate to
better than 8 m rms when compared to a careful survey of the area.  Most of this
error was caused by turbulent mixing of water vapor in the atmosphere.  The presence
of the water vapor was revealed by small inconsistencies in the two interferograms, which
were afforded by the three
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
passes.<BR>
<BR>
The rms, one-way time delay of the atmospheric turbulence was found to be 0.24 cm.
Identical results were found from the L-band data set.<BR>
<BR>
A paper describing these results has been accepted for publication in <CITE>Geophysical Research Letters</CITE>
.<BR>
<BR>
Gulf Stream Site<BR>
<BR>
The first and third leaf of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
C-band antenna were connected to separate receivers
in a mode which enabled front-back interferometry.   The shortness of the baseline
(4 m) notwithstanding, interferograms of the gulf stream area were able to image
the stream boundary directly.  The boundary is seen as a change in the line-of-sight
velocity.<BR>
<BR>
Preliminary results of this effort were presented at the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IGARSS">IGARSS</a> 
'95 meeting.  A journal
article is in work.<BR>
<BR>
Top of the Orbit Site<BR>
<BR>
Good interferometer fringes have been obtained of the Meade Glacier, along the Canadian-Alaskan
border. The fringes contain information on both the glacier motion and its topography.
At this time we have been able to separate out the part due to motion and to quantify the line-of-sight component.<BR>
<BR>
We are currently working on the motion-corrected topography.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
We plan to develop our technique of glacier study using three-pass radar interferometry
with the Meade Glacier observations and with other data sets along the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
repeat
tracks.<BR>
<BR>
We plan to do the same with respect to atmospheric limitations to the accuracy of
measuring small displacements and of measuring topography.  The Fort Irwin data represent
an extreme because of its desert environment.  Other areas will give more representative observations, and, perhaps, stronger limitations.<BR>
<BR>
We expect these plans to result in several more journal articles.<BR>

Radar Interferometric and Penetration Investigations using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
Data<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
To model, experimentally characterize, and verify penetration phenomena in hyperarid
and vegetated regions using the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
multiparameter radar system and groundbased
receivers.<BR>
<BR>
To invert measured radar backscatter as a function of frequency and polarization in
terms of geophysical parameters of the surface, subsurface and vegetation canopy
such as surface roughness, subsurface geomorphology, or tree height and density.<BR>
<BR>
To display subsurface and within-canopy features in an image format, thus easing the
interpretability of the results.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
We are currently involved in two study areas associated with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a>. 
  The first is
the study of penetration phenomena that relate radar backscatter data in vegetated
and hyperarid regions to geophysical factors of the surface cover.  The second involves
development of radar interferometry as a technique and is important for the future of
NASA's radar program, which is likely to contain a significant radar interferometry
component.<BR>
<BR>
Interferometric data are requested in raw signal sample format, which we process to
interferograms and subsequent topographic and deformation products.  We developed
a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
interferometric data processor which we run on workstation computers-- the
software includes the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
processing algorithms, interferogram generation software, baseline
estimation algorithms, and product generation code.<BR>
<BR>
The data for the penetration experiment are also obtained from the raw signal samples.
They are extracted using Fourier spectrum techniques and times series of amplitude
and phase fluctuations are produced.  These times series are then cross correlated
to infer the impulse response of sub-canopy radar reflectors as well as the attenuation
of the canopy.  These results must be related to parameters of the canopy to derive
the ability of the system to &quot;see&quot; under the trees.  This will be of significant
note in future topographic and other interferometric systems aimed at obtaining under-canopy
heights.<BR>
<BR>
Significant Results and Publications<BR>
<BR>
During the past year and one half, the most significant results have been those related
to radar interferometry.  We have quantified the performance of repeat pass spaceborne
interferometric topographic maps, and verified the results by comparison with existing maps.  We have also developed the three-pass surface deformation technique,
verified it against
   <a href="Acronyms.html#GPS">GPS</a> 
and field survey approaches, and compared results of two-pass
and three-pass analyses of earthquakes.<BR>
<BR>
We have also used
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
correlation measurements to track active lava flows at Kilauea,
and obtained the most precise estimates of flow volume and mass rates to date.<BR>
<BR>
For this work we developed a theory for the effects of atmospheric variability on
repeat-pass interferometric observations.  These are likely the limiting factors
in any practical deformation or repeat-pass topographic system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
The approach to completing the science studies as identified in the original proposal,
as well as the interferometric experiments that were added to the project science
plan, is a two-fold strategy.  Both sets of activities are in the data analysis phase,
that is, the mission and field deployment component of the studies is essentially
complete with the end of the planned flights of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
hardware.  The remaining
work concerns data processing, interferometric analysis, penetration analysis, verification with field measurements, and publication and reporting.<BR>
<BR>
Penetration study.  During the first and second
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
flights, special purpose portable
transmitters and receivers were deployed at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
supersites.  For flight 1, the
site was located at Raco, Michigan, and consisted of temperate forest trees.  For
flight 2, the site was located at Kilauea, Hawaii, and consisted of a rain forest region.
During shuttle overflights, ground receivers recorded the absolute level of radar
signals as they were propagated through and attenuated by the vegetation canopy.
In addition, coherent tone generators transmitted narrowband signals back up to the shuttle.
These signals are to be extracted from radar received echo waveforms.  In each instance
equipment was simultaneously placed under the canopy and also in an open area to provide a reference signal.<BR>
<BR>
For each overpass, the receiver measurements will be compared between equipment in
the open and in the canopy.  The resulting fluctuating power measurements will then
be related to models of scatter by the vegetation.  The transmitter measurements
will be extracted from the radar echoes and separated by frequency transform techniques.
A cross-correlation of the open and canopy transmitter signals then yields an effective
impulse response of the radar to targets hidden in the canopy independent of shuttle
motion.  This again will be related to scattering models of the canopy for both the
temperate and rain forest terrain types.<BR>
<BR>
Interferometer investigations. 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
collected two types of interferometric data.
These were data with a six-month temporal baseline collected during both flight
1 and flight 2, and data with a one-, two-, or three-day temporal baseline collected
wholly during flight 2.  We propose to investigate this data set using two types of analysis:
i) generation of topographic maps and ii) measurement of surface deformation.<BR>
<BR>
Since
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
is a multifrequency instrument, it offers the unique opportunity to compare
results at different frequencies.  Phenomenological differences in the scattering
behavior at 24 cm and 6 cm wavelength will comprise a major part of this investigation.<BR>
<BR>
We will process these data from the raw signal sample format, as delivered by the

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
ground data processing facility.  We will generate topographic maps of several
of the supersite areas at both frequencies, and compare them to conventionally derived
digital elevation models to assess their accuracy.  These will then be made available
to the science team to aid in other investigations.<BR>
<BR>
We also will examine the potential of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
to determine surface deformation.  The
principal data set here will be the six-month data as the centimeter-level motion
we are sensitive to will be much more apparent over six months than three days.<BR>
<BR>
A significant part of the latter study is to understand the effects of the atmosphere
on the received signals.  This will involve processing some of the 1, 2, and 3 day
data to look for apparent motion caused by atmospheric irregularities.  These interfering signals will be quantified and assessed for their impact in future space-based
radar systems.<BR>
<BR>
The benefits from these investigations will accrue from both sets of activities.
The penetration studies will aid in design of radar systems capable of imaging beneath
canopies, important for ecological studies as well as for target detection systems.
They also will provide new insights into the physics behind scattering from dense canopies.<BR>
<BR>
It has now been demonstrated that interferometric radar techniques benefit a wide
variety of Earth science investigations, including production of digital elevation
models of the Earth's surface, centimeter-scale surface deformation measurements
of coseismic displacement fields, and centimeter-per-day velocity maps of ice sheets and glaciers.
The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
experiments will give us the first quality set of multifrequency data
that can be used to examine phenomenological changes dependent on radar wavelength.
It also will permit the first full examination of the artifacts induced by atmospheric
interference.  This approach will enable the fastest and most thorough means to realize
the full potential of radar interferometry for geoscience applications.<BR>

Image Spectra with Ocean Wave
Spectra Derived from Buoys and Wave Production Models in the North Sea<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Carry out measurements of two-dimensional ocean wave spectra by a pitch and roll buoy
from the Forschungsplatform Nordsee (Germany Research Platform North Sea) and from
a ship of the German Hydrographic Office in the North Sea.  Collaborate with North
Sea oil rig operators to obtain wave spectra from these sites.<BR>
<BR>
A third generation wave prediction model (WAMODEL) will be applied to forecast and
hindcast  the  wave  fields in  the  North  Sea  from  the measured  wind history
during the <BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
overflight.  The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#WAMODEL">WAMODEL</a> 
has a resolution of 0.5 degree longitude and 0.25 degree
latitude.  This model (Komen and Zambreski, 1986; Bauer et al. 1988) seems to be
accurate in predicting two-dimensional ocean wave spectra in the North Sea and will
be refined for the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
mission.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
During both shuttle missions, experimenters at the University of Hamburg performed
experiments in the German Bight of the North Sea, off the island of Sylt. The aim
of these experiments was to investigate the radar signatures which are caused by
different surface films, i.e., by different monomolecular slicks consisting of artificial biogenic
substances and, on the other hand, by different mineral oils, i.e., heavy and light
(Diesel) fuel. The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data from both experiments were acquired and processed in different ways, i.e., performing different statistical analyses, during the
last months.  In addition to the experiments in the German Bight, Japanese scientists
under the leadership of Dr. H. Masuko performed similar surface film experiments
off the Japanese coast.  Here, a certain substance was deployed several times to get a reliable
set of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images with radar signatures for intercomparison and polarimetric studies.
X-SAR quicklook processor data tapes provided by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DLR">DLR</a>, 
 as well as the quicklook data on CD ROM provided by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
(L- or C-band), and I-PAF (X-band) after both shuttle
missions have been checked for features which could be of interest for oceanographic
studies. It turned out that in several parts of the world's oceans the water surface
was covered with surface films during the shuttle flights. However, only a few data
takes showing oil spills have been found (e.g., one large oil spill in the Baltic
Sea during the first shuttle mission). Therefore, a collection of interesting scenes
taken in different
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
modes (i.e., only like-polarization or full polarization mode) have
been ordered and are to be processed in the near future.  <BR>
<BR>
Another aim of the participation of the University of Hamburg in the shuttle missions
was to compare wave spectra obtained from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images at different radar bands
and polarizations with in-situ data from buoy measurements and spectra obtained from
a wave prediction model (WAM) provided by the European Center for Medium Range Weather
Forecast (ECMWF). For this purpose,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images from the North Sea test site have
been acquired and processed.  A
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
image taken during the first shuttle mission
over the northeast (NE) Atlantic shows a broad, dark band crossing the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
track. After watching
the videotape of this data take (96.3), scientists first thought that this dark band
was due to a mineral oil spill. However, it turned out that a strong atmospheric
(rain) front was responsible for this signature. The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images of this topic have been
ordered and processed. Other data takes of the NE Atlantic (adjacent in space and
time) have been checked for this front, however, such strong signatures have not
been found. Furthermore, bright signatures caused by strong rain cells have been found on

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images of the Tropical Pacific, the Mexican Gulf, and the Central Atlantic. They
will be processed and studied during the next months.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
The two slick experiments in the German Bight took place under different weather conditions:
During the first mission, on April 18, the weather was fine with a wind speed of
5 m/s, but during the second mission, on October 6, the weather was stormy, and the wind speed raised up to values of more than 10 m/s. Under these strong wind conditions,
surface slicks remain on the water surface only for a short time, because they are
rapidly washed down. However, most of the deployed surface films have been recognized as dark patches on the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images taken at this test site.  It turned out that
the surface wave damping behavior of one substance (oleyl alcohol), which was used
for both experiments, was different for the unlike wind conditions: Under strong
winds the measured reduction of the radar backscatter was lower and was comparable to one of
the other substances, especially mineral oil (one has to admit that, for environmental
reasons, the amount of mineral oil was kept very small, so that this oil spill obviously showed a damping behavior similar to that of the monomolecular surface films).
Significant differences between the surface films resulting from various statistical
processing have therefore not been found.  On the other hand, under low to moderate
wind conditions, the monomolecular slick deployed during the first experiment showed a
different damping behavior from a mineral oil spill that was found on a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
image
of the Baltic Sea. A characteristic damping maximum at C-band has been found which
can be explained by the Marangoni damping theory (which is applicable to monomolecular surface
films). This result is in agreement with the results obtained from the Japanese scientists
during their experiments (Masuko and Alpers, 1995). The mineral oil spill in the Baltic Sea showed a strong inhomogeneity, because of a drifting of the upper oil
layer, due to wind and surface currents. However, on the thick (windward) edge of
the spill, in particular, a different damping behavior was found, i.e., no damping
maximum at C-band, but an increasing radar contrast with increasing radar wave number (Gade
and Alpers 1995a) (Gade and Alpers 1995b).  Recent polarimetric studies of slick-free
and slick-covered water surfaces have shown that there are differences in the polarization signatures with respect to incidence angle, wind (i.e., surface roughness), and
slick coverage. In all cases, Bragg scattering seems to be the dominant scattering
mechanism, where the fraction of spatial scattering varies with incidence and slick
coverage.  The processing of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
image spectra, which was extensively done with the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 

airborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
(AIRSAR) images taken in 1991, was extended to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data taken
over the North Sea and showed distinct wave systems. The two-dimensional image spectra
processed from these
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images show unimodal wave systems and reproduce very well the
spectra obtained using the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#WAM">WAM</a> 
model, with respect to peak wavelength and direction.
This can be explained by the weak nonlinearity of the imaging of these ocean waves,
except for the cases of shallow water close to the coastline.  Further image spectra,
which were calculated on both sides of the atmospheric front over the Atlantic Ocean,
showed strong differences, although taken at a distance of only 25 km from each other: The obtained spectra were rotated, which was most pronounced for X-band and less
for L-band. This effect can be explained by the different dependence of the ocean
wave-radar modulation transfer function (MTF) on wind speed, which results in a different
imaging of the wave fields. This could be proved by simulations of wave spectra for
both sides of the front (Alpers et al. 1995a).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
The results on radar signatures of different ocean surface films are not yet sufficient
for any definitive statement on whether or not active radar techniques are capable
of discriminating between natural (biogenic) slicks and (manmade) mineral oil spills. Therefore, more
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
scenes showing surface slicks or mineral oil spills (e.g., oil
spills around oil drilling fields in the Arabian Sea west of Bombay) are to be studied
in the future. Special attention will be focused on polarimetric studies of these

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
scenes. New chemical insights into the morphology of monomolecular surface films
will be gained from laboratory experiments. Results will be presented at the next
International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) (Alpers et al. 1996)
and in a Ph.D. thesis (Gade 1996).<BR>
<BR>
Theoretical studies of the classification of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
image spectra, i.e., a new method
of the best fit between simulated and measured image spectra, will be published soon
in a Ph.D. thesis (Schmidt 1995).<BR>
<BR>
Taking advantage of the polarimetric capabilities of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
radar system, more
studies regarding the backscattering mechanism of the water surface (theoretical
as well as experimental) shall be done. For this purpose, some additional
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
scenes
may be ordered.  For studies of radar signatures of rain cells over the world's oceans, more

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
scenes shall be ordered to get reliable statistical results out of the huge amount
of such data.  First results coming out of these studies will be presented at the

   <a href="Acronyms.html#IGARSS">IGARSS</a> 
'96 Symposium (Alpers et al. 1996). The results may be extended by laboratory
experiments.  Several
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images were taken over the Wadden Sea in the German Bight
showing distinct dark and bright structures corresponding to underwater bottom topography or dry-fallen sandbanks. This interesting data set is worth being studied, and the
results will be compared with those obtained from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images and with theoretical
models for surface convergence (and the resulting radar backscatter).<BR>

Global Wave Forecasting in the Southern Ocean<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the potential value of spaceborne Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) for operational ocean wave monitoring and forecasting.<BR>
<BR>
This project complements the Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) investigation &quot;Optimization
of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
Parameters for Wave Spectra&quot; (PI: F. Monaldo, CI: R. Beal), with somewhat
overlapping tasks and similar goals, that is, the understanding and application of
spaceborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
to operational ocean wave monitoring and forecasting.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Using the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#APL">APL</a> 
real-time
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
processor with both the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
missions, we have
acquired a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
wave imaging and comparison data set more than two orders of magnitude
greater than in any previous U.S.
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
mission.  This SRL data set is all the more
unique and valuable, since it was acquired at both a low altitude and a low off-nadir
angle.  Both of these are necessary conditions for any future free flyer dedicated
to global ocean wave monitoring.  The data set for our SRL investigation consists
of:<BR>
<BR>
1) Over 100,000
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
Image Spectra over the Southern Ocean from the real-time
   <a href="Acronyms.html#APL">APL</a> 
SAR
Processor: 45,000 from April, and 55,000 from October.<BR>
<BR>
2) Eighteen precision, high resolution
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
imagery data-takes correlated by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>, 
 both
over the Southern Ocean and over the North Atlantic.<BR>
<BR>
3) Numerical wave model (WAM) nowcasts for the periods covering both April and October
missions, from both the U.S. Navy Fleet Numerical and Meteorological Center (Monterey)
and the European Centre for Medium Range Forecasting (ECMWF) (Reading).<BR>
<BR>
4) European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1)
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
derived wave spectra from the Max
Planck Institute covering the entire globe for the time intervals of both the April
and October missions.<BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#APL">APL</a> 
Processor
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
Data<BR>
<BR>
Aboard Endeavour, an APL-built processor correlated
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
imagery from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
C-band
HH-polarization signal and produced image spectra which were transmitted to the ground
in real time. More than 100,000 image spectra from the APL-processor were stored
from 120 data takes in
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and 126 data takes in
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a>. 
  The wave spectra cover most
of the Southern Ocean from 45S to 60S. The data set includes measurements where the
ocean significant wave height (SWH) varied from near zero to over 12 m, spanning
nearly the full range of naturally occurring sea states.<BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#WAM">WAM</a> 
Nowcasts<BR>
<BR>
During
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a>, 
 the Navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center
(FNMOC) retained the nowcast spectra made from their version of the operational
   <a href="Acronyms.html#WAM">WAM</a> 

forecast model. An analogous comparison model data set is also available from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ECMWF">ECMWF</a> 

through collaborators at the Max Planck Institute (Hamburg).<BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
Imagery<BR>
<BR>
Given the broad geographical coverage of data from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#APL">APL</a> 
processor, there are at
least 30 times in the Southern Ocean during each mission when
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
wave spectra
and APL-processor image spectra were located less than 50 km apart and acquired within
one hour of one another.  Loosening the colocation criteria only slightly will produce
more than 100 such comparisons sets.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Using real-time APL-processor data received at Johnson Space Center, we merged
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 

wave vector estimates over the Southern Ocean with wave vector forecasts from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#FNMOC">FNMOC</a>, 

and daily placed the combined products on a World Wide Web site. During the mission,
the site was visited more than 150 times by investigators from as far away as South Africa
and Australia. This effort demonstrated the potential of providing wave information
from spaceborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
quickly enough to be usefully assimilated into wave forecast
models.  The site<BR>
<BR>
<a href="ftp://fermi.jhuapl.edu/sirc/sirc.html">
ftp://fermi.jhuapl.edu/sirc/sirc.html</a>
<BR>
<BR>
currently shows recent data and analyses from the SRL missions. In the past year,
we have processed image spectra with only a simple
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
modulation transfer function.
Even these results show quality retrievals of wave direction and wavelength.  In
the future, we will employ more sophisticated retrieval schemes that may permit the accurate
measurement of ocean
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SWH">SWH</a> 
as well.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Given the totality of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
image spectra,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
spectra, and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#WAM">WAM</a> 
model estimates,
we intend to 1) make a definitive determination of what ocean wave parameters can
be extracted from spaceborne SARs and with what accuracy; 2) specify the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
satellite configuration that optimizes this retrieval; and 3) demonstrate, with a statistically
significant data set, the value of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
for improved global wave forecasting.<BR>
<BR>
We are currently collaborating with William Plant who, while a visiting scientist
at the Max Planck Institute this last year, applied nonlinear retrieval algorithms
to estimate wave spectra from coincident
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
data.  We expect to submit
a joint paper in the upcoming year, documenting the comparison of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
and SIR-C-derived
image spectra.<BR>
<BR>
We intend to make a systematic comparison, wave system by wave system, to ascertain
systematic differences between
   <a href="Acronyms.html#WAM">WAM</a> 
model wave estimates and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
measurements for
the entire Southern Ocean data set.  We will then determine whether these differences
are due to input wind field errors, model problems, and/or
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
wave imaging limitations.
We expect the results to form the major scientific and operational justification
for a low altitude wave monitoring
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
satellite.  Such a satellite would easily
fit into the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASA">NASA</a> 
&quot;Lightsat&quot; category, and would also be a candidate for the &quot;New Millennium&quot;
spacecraft announcement of opportunity.  Both the U.S. Navy and National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have strong interests in the improvement of
operational wave forecast products that would be possible with such a dedicated low altitude
free-flyer.  Moreover,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASA">NASA</a> 
should have an equally strong interest in the demonstration
of the advanced technology necessary to do the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
on-board processing and the real-time global dissemination of data to a worldwide user network.<BR>

A Study of the Potential of Multicomponent
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
Imagery for Agricultural and Forestry
Studies<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Develop the methods to fully exploit multicomponent
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data sets of agricultural
and forestry areas.<BR>
<BR>
Determine the radiometric information content of multicomponent
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
imagery of agricultural
and forested areas by developing backscatter models.<BR>
<BR>
Develop techniques for the derivation of specific target information from a multicomponent
data set, and consequently determine the optimum set of measurement parameters for
use in specifying future
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
missions.<BR>
<BR>
Develop improved image processing techniques for the extraction of specific image
attributes from these images.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
To date, the analysis team have received more than 50 
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
or X-SAR image products.
They cover three sites:<BR>
<BR>
<ul>
<ul>
Feltwell/Thetford in England<BR>
Tapajos in Brazil<BR>
Manaus
   <a href="Acronyms.html#CSAP">CSAP</a> 
in Brazil<BR>
</ul>
</ul>
<BR>
Generally, the data have been of a very high quality.  However, some problems have
been noted with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
antenna pattern corrections over Tapajos, and other artifacts
(e.g., nadir ambiguities and interference in certain data).  Feedback on these has
been given to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a>. 
<BR>
<BR>
The English data takes encompass agricultural and forestry research sites, while the
Brazilian sites cover areas of tropical forest and regeneration.<BR>
<BR>
Analysis is being conducted by GEC-Marconi Research Centre, primarily on the agricultural
site at Feltwell, by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#RSADU">RSADU</a> 
on Thetford Forest, Tapajos and Manaus, by the University
of Sheffield on Tapajos and Feltwell, and by the University of Swansea on Manaus.<BR>
<BR>
At GEC-Marconi Research Centre, imagery of the agricultural test site from both missions
has been ingested into a database.  Field-averaged mean backscatter levels have been
investigated to date, with particular attention given to examining differences between
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
observations early and late in the growing season, with previous
results from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
campaigns in 1989 and 1991 in the middle of the growing season.
Essentially the aim here has been to provide a clearer indication of the radar channels,
whether polarimetric or multifrequency, which are necessary for effective crop identification.
A preliminary investigation has also been undertaken of the accuracy of soil moisture
retrieval using the algorithm of Pascale Dubois.<BR>
<BR>
At
   <a href="Acronyms.html#RSADU">RSADU</a>, 
 Thetford Forest imagery from both missions are being entered into a long-
standing database which also contains various
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a>, 
 and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JERS-1">JERS-1</a> 
images of
the forest.  Comparisons are being made of the relationships between backscatter
cross sections as a function of forest biomass between the different sensors.  Over Tapajos,
only
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
imagery from the October mission is currently being analyzed, because
of the calibration problems with the April acquisition.  The October data have been
added to a Tapajos database containing
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JERS-1">JERS-1</a>, 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
satellite images, and images from the
Canadian
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAREX">SAREX</a> 
experiment.  Biomass change is, again, the focus of analysis, with
field data having been gathered in 1994 as part of a joint Brazil/UK ground experiment.
The Tapajos analysis is also being related to work on the Manaus
   <a href="Acronyms.html#CSAP">CSAP</a> 
site.  Along
with ground measurements for sample plots in the Manaus region made in 1993 and 1995,
an April scene is being used to validate the relationships between biomass and microwave backscatter derived at Tapajos.  The Sheffield team have started examining multipolarized
image segmentation, using the agricultural Feltwell area as a test site.  They also
have an interest in sites at Tapajos, although these were not ideally imaged by the selected Tapajos swath.<BR>
<BR>
Field work at Manaus has continued.  This year, the team from Swansea undertook a
further field campaign and collected data from 22 forests of different ages.  A preliminary
analysis of Manaus imagery has been undertaken.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Feltwell Agriculture<BR>
<BR>
The agricultural experiments at somewhat unconventional times of the growing season
have yielded some very clear and fascinating results.  With relatively little ground
cover by crops, we found the L-band channels of limited effectiveness in discriminating crop types.  This compares markedly with observations at the height of the growing
season made with the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a>. 
  Rather, we see polarimetric C-band observations as
the main source of discrimination.  Information contained in the HH-to-VV correlation
was of most apparent value.  The L- and C-band results have been backed up by simulations
using a second-order radiative transfer backscatter model.  It was also observed
that, under these conditions, C-VV and X-VV backscatter measurements were very highly
correlated.<BR>
<BR>
Initial attempts at using Dubois' algorithm for soil moisture retrieval have not proved
successful.  However, there is probably a need for more careful consideration of
the calibration status of the data before more firm conclusions are drawn.<BR>
<BR>
No open-literature publications have yet been made.  An account of the agricultural
discrimination work has been prepared for the British National Space Centre (GEC-Marconi
Research Centre Report MTR 95/51 by P. Wright et al.), and of the soil moisture retrievals for the European Space Agency (&quot;SAR Retrieval Algorithms for Land Applications&quot;
MTR 95/36, by R. Cordey et al).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thetford Forest<BR>
<BR>
The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
L-HH data over Thetford Forest support the conclusions already reached from

   <a href="Acronyms.html#JERS-1">JERS-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data and show a monotonic rise in backscatter with biomass density
up to 50-80 tonnes per hectare, with saturation being reached thereafter. The behavior of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
L-HV is currently being investigated to determine its dynamic range and
saturation point.<BR>
<BR>
Manaus<BR>
<BR>
Early results from the Swansea team are currently being written up for a letter in
the International Journal of Remote Sensing.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Across the various test sites, there remains a considerable program of work to be
undertaken.  The priority for the agricultural analysis is to find an appropriate
route to publication.  Presentation at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#PIERS">PIERS</a> 
(Innsbruck) is anticipated.  Elsewhere,
analysis programs are to be pursued.  Joint analysis of tropical forest biomass estimation
between the Tapajos and Manaus sites is planned at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#RSADU">RSADU</a>, 
 while the Swansea team
are to begin bringing optical data (Landsat) into their analyses.  The Sheffield
group plan to continue their studies with more detailed statistical analyses of the agricultural
imagery over Feltwell.<BR>
<BR>
Generally,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data have attracted much attention as a multiparameter satellite
data set and it is anticipated that the interest in the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#UK">UK</a> 
will continue to broaden
beyond the confines of the specific agricultural and forestry experiments reported
here.<BR>

Reconstruction of the Mesoscale Velocity Shear Seaward of Coastal Upwelling Regions
from the Refraction of the Surface Wave Field<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
The objective of this project is to study fronts that develop at the boundary between
cold water recently upwelled to the surface through Ekman divergence, and warmer
surrounding waters.  This specific objective was suggested by studying the small
scale structure of upwelling fronts (coastal, island, and equatorial) through shipboard surveys
and infrared satellite images.<BR>
<BR>
Constraints on the shuttle equator crossing imposed by other land sites precluded
a coverage of the area targeted in the initial
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
proposal, the California Current.
The site was then relocated to the Equatorial Pacific upwelling tongue, that can
be satisfactorily imaged for a wide range of longitudes of the equator crossing.<BR>
<BR>
Some limited data was nevertheless obtained over coastal upwelling off California
in 1989, using the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
in multifrequency mode, and over island upwelling off
Hawaii in 1990, using the radar in along-track interferometric mode.<BR>
<BR>
Aircraft Work<BR>
<BR>
Coastal Upwelling<BR>
<BR>
In summertime, the California Current is characterized by intense jets carrying cold
water from near shore upwelling towards offshore; they appear as cold filaments in
satellite infrared images of sea surface temperature.  These jets are delimited by
sharp thermal and velocity fronts, which are often convergent, and are subject to small-scale
instabilities.<BR>
<BR>
In previous shipboard surveys, clusters of surface drifters were deployed to measure
the horizontal velocity gradient across these filaments.  In the anticyclonic region,
the flow was generally nondivergent  with  a  shear of -0.3 f, but  at  the  cyclonic front, the flow was discontinuous at the <BR>
1 km resolution of the clusters, with a shear larger than 4.5 f, associated with a
cross-frontal surface convergence larger than 0.7 f, visible as a ~20 m-wide accumulation
of debris of seaweed, and sometime variations of surface roughness.<BR>
<BR>
A complete
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
survey of the filament rooted near Point Arena (northern California)
was acquired on 8 September 1989, using infrared images from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NOAA">NOAA</a> 
satellites
to guide the aircraft to features of interest.  The radar was illuminating the ocean
at C-, L- and P-bands, and was operated in polarimetric mode, including horizontal, vertical,
and cross-polarization at each wavelength.<BR>
<BR>
At all frequencies, the signatures of the thermal fronts appeared as bright delineations
in the radar images, presumably made visible where waves were undergoing refraction
by the current shear, resulting in increased amplitude. Several dark delineations,
often parallel to the front, were also observed, possibly corresponding to internal
waves radiating away from the front, made visible by biological films concentrated
along convergence zones, thus reducing the amplitude of Bragg-scattering waves.<BR>
<BR>
Island Upwelling<BR>
<BR>
The Hawaiian Islands present obstacles to the northeasterly trade winds, creating
calm regions in the lee. Sharp horizontal shear lines usually separate the 10-15
m/s trades from the calm regions.  These shear lines extend several island radii
downwind.<BR>
<BR>
The variations of wind stress along the cyclonic shear line to the northwest of the
Island of Hawaii, and the response of the ocean, were studied in August 1990 including
along-track interferometry in the L-band. Concurrent data were obtained from a ship
using a towed undulating
   <a href="Acronyms.html#CTD">CTD</a> 
(SeaSoar), an acoustic Doppler current profiler and satellite-tracked
drifting buoys, and from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NCAR">NCAR</a> 
Electra meteorological aircraft conducting boundary
layer flights.  Infrared images from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NOAA">NOAA</a> 
satellites, and 10-m resolution sun glint images from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SPOT">SPOT</a> 
satellite were also available.<BR>
<BR>
Backscatter intensities in the L- and C-band were strongly modulated by the variations
of surface wind stress, and showed that the cyclonic shear line was just a few tens-of-meters
wide, much narrower than the ~2 km height of the planetary boundary layer. There was a strong gradient coinciding with the shear line in the along-track phase
image, suggesting downwind surface flow in the trade wind regime, and a slight flow
towards shore in the calm lee; however this phase variation did not correspond to
detectable surface current variations in the acoustic Doppler current meter data.  The correlation
image showed high correlation in the lee, and much smaller correlation in the trade
wind regime, where white capping was frequent.<BR>
<BR>
Two effects of these wind stress variations on the upper ocean were observed during
the ship survey.  One-dimensionally, the mixed-layer depth was modulated by the wind
stress: outside the calm region, a deep mixed layer was observed, whereas in the
calm region, the mechanical energy provided by the wind was not sufficient to erode the
2-4 m warm buoyant layer resulting from solar heating. Intense diurnal warming was
observed at the surface and a thermal front coincided with the shear line observed
in the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images.  Two-dimensionally, the curl of the wind stress along the cyclonic shear
line induced upward Ekman pumping, spinning up a strong cyclonic eddy.<BR>
<BR>
Shuttle Radar work<BR>
<BR>
The surface front separating cold equatorial water from warmer tropical water at 2-7N
in the Central Pacific was studied twice for one week in April and October 1994 between
115W and 155W by the shuttle synthetic aperture radar imaging in L-, C- and X-bands, with supporting
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NOAA">NOAA</a> 
satellites infrared images.<BR>
<BR>
During the October flight (the peak of the equatorial upwelling season), zonal linear
features of enhanced backscatter intensity were observed at all wavelengths, and
corresponded closely to the thermal front seen in the infrared images.  On some data
takes, several linear features were found at different latitudes, suggesting that the
front may not have been unique. The motion of the front estimated from successive
daily images was consistent with the westward propagation found by previous studies.
In contrast, no fronts were observed in the images taken during the April flight, which
were dominated by the surface signature of rain cells.<BR>
<BR>
The front was also visible as brightness changes in
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AVHRR">AVHRR</a> 
images of the sun glint,
and photographs of the glint taken from the Space Shuttle show the equatorial front
as a quasi-linear feature, often darker than surrounding water.<BR>
<BR>
These observations are consistent with <CITE>in situ</CITE>
fR data collected during the Tropical Instability Wave Experiment in 1992 and 1995,
which indicated that the temperature front was 1.2 deg C over 1 km or less, and was
confined to the ~100-m-thick mixed layer.  Fine-structure was observed, suggesting
northward subduction of cold, high salinity equatorial water, beneath warmer less saline

   <a href="Acronyms.html#ITCZ">ITCZ</a> 
water.  A 40 km drifter array deployed on the cold side of the front became
aligned with the front in less than three days.  The velocity averaged over five
frontal crossings showed a 10 km-wide westward jet of 90 cm/s and a cross-frontal convergence
of 15 cm/s, both confined above the thermocline.<BR>
<BR>
During these cruises, white capping was frequently enhanced over a band ~100 m wide
near the front, presumably due to surface wave refraction by the velocity gradient.
Presumably, the linear features observed in the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images correspond to these bands
of enhanced wave breaking.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

An Investigation of the Imaging of Ocean Waves and Oil Slicks with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and X-SAR<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
To improve our understanding of ocean-wave imaging by synthetic-aperture radar (SAR).<BR>
<BR>
To test the assumptions of backscattering theory with regard to short-wave properties.<BR>
<BR>
To develop new techniques for retrieving ocean-wave spectra from multiparameter
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a>. 
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Multilook
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data have been acquired for all the orbits coinciding with buoy
measurements at the N. E. Atlantic site in the first mission (April 1994).  There
were no in-situ measurements during the second mission.  The April 1994 experiment
was successful, with many clear instances of the imaging of ocean swell waves at times
of buoy measurements, and some clearly imaged artificial oil slicks.  An initial
analysis of the wave imaging has been made, and a more detailed study of the mean
backscatter and backscatter statistics is currently in progress.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
An initial analysis was undertaken to assess the wavelengths and directions of the
dominant swell waves imaged on two orbits.  Good agreement was found with the simultaneous
buoy data, although the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data showed a small but significant rotation of the position of the spectral peak with changing radar frequency.  These results have been
reported at
   <a href="Acronyms.html#IGARSS">IGARSS</a> 
95.<BR>
<BR>
Further analysis has shown that the imaged wave modulations have a strong polarization
dependence close to the range direction, but not in the azimuth direction.  This
agrees with the expected strong polarization dependence of the tilting imaging mechanism.  Other initial results confirm the successful imaging of oleyl alcohol films deployed
during this experiment.<BR>
<BR>
However, the main thrust of our work has been the analysis of the mean backscatter
and backscatter statistics.  Empirical models of the mean backscatter have been tested.
There is very good agreement, to 1 dB (standard deviation), with the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
C-band
scatterometer model functions
   <a href="Acronyms.html#CMOD-3">CMOD-3</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#CMOD-4">CMOD-4</a>. 
  Theoretical models show some systematic
disagreements with radar frequency, pointing to a need to modify existing descriptions
of short-wave spectra.<BR>
<BR>
The single-look image statistics fit the K distribution, but all the multilook cases
fit the lognormal distribution.  Modelling of backscatter variances has been studied.
It has been found that the observed variances can be explained in terms of the contribution from resolved ocean waves.  We have applied wave-imaging theory to estimate
this contribution from our buoy data.  We find agreement with observations if the
hydrodynamical modulation is increased above the level predicted by the simple action-balance theory of Alpers &amp; Hasselmann.  This result agrees with tower-radar measurements.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
New Data Requests<BR>
<BR>
We now have all the multilook data-sets needed for comparison with our simultaneous
wave-buoy measurements at the N. E. Atlantic site in the first mission (April 1994).
We envisage a need for more single-look, complex scenes over this site, and the
images and raw data from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SCANSAR">SCANSAR</a> 
passes over the N. Atlantic.  We expect to define our
requirements when our present program of work finishes in February 1996.  We do not
have any immediate plans to study data from the second mission (October 1994) as
no in-situ measurements were made at our site.<BR>
<BR>
Future Work<BR>
<BR>
Our present work on the mean backscatter and backscatter statistics is scheduled to
finish in February 1996.  We are considering the possibility of follow-on work to
examine alternative ways of combining the simultaneous
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
channels to reduce
ocean-clutter false alarms in target detection.  Analysis of the imaged oil slicks by
DRA Winfrith is expected to commence in 1996.<BR>

Optimization of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
Parameters for Wave Spectra<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>OBJECTIVES<BR></strong>
<BR>
Maximize the amount of ocean wave information extracted from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
imagery.<BR>
<BR>
Determine those
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
parameters --- look angle, frequency, polarization, etc. --- which
produce highest fidelity ocean wave spectra.<BR>
<BR>
This project can be considered joint and involves collaboration from the Southern
Ocean experiment (PI: R. Beal, CI: F. Monaldo, T. Gerling), with largely overlapping
tasks and common goals, that is, the application of spaceborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
to operational
ocean wave monitoring and forecasting.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>PROGRESS<BR></strong>
<BR>
With both the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
missions, we have acquired a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
wave imaging and comparison
data set more than two orders of magnitude greater than in any previous U.S.
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 

mission.  The SRL data set is all the more unique and valuable to us, since it was
acquired at both a low altitude and low off-nadir angle.  These are both necessary
conditions for any future free flyer dedicated to global ocean wave monitoring.
The data set for our SRL investigation consists of:<BR>
<BR>
Over 100,000
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
Image Spectra over the Southern Ocean from the real-time
   <a href="Acronyms.html#APL">APL</a>

<BR>
Eighteen precision, high resolution

both over the Southern Ocean and over the North Atlantic.<BR>
<BR>

missions, from both the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#US">US</a>

and the European Centre for Medium Range Forecasting (ECMWF)(Reading).<BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
derived wave spectra from the Max Planck Institute covering the entire globe
for the time intervals of both the April and October missions.<BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#APL">APL</a> 
Processor
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
Data<BR>
<BR>
Aboard the Endeavour, an APL-built processor correlated
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
imagery from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 

C-band HH-polarization signal and produced image spectra which were transmitted to
the ground in real time. More than 100,000 image spectra from the APL-processor were
stored from 120 data takes in
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and 126 data takes in
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a>. 
  The wave spectra cover
most of the Southern Ocean from 45S to 60S. The data set includes measurements where
the ocean significant wave height varied from near zero to over 12 m, spanning nearly
the full range of naturally occurring sea states.<BR>
<BR>


   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASA">NASA</a> 
Precision, High-Resolution Data<BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
signal outside the southern oceans was acquired in the Northeast Atlantic supersite.
During
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a>, 
 20 and 18 data takes were acquired from the Northeast Atlantic,
respectively.  We now have, in house from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a>, 
 precision-processed multilook data from the following data takes:  19.20, 31.30, 35.30, 35.3, 47.10, 51.6, 63.10,
79.00, 83.40, 95.3.,110.0, 127.10, 131.5, 143.10.<BR>
<BR>
We plan to request a similar data set from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a>. 
  Unlike the first data set, we plan
to order single-look complex data to allow for the application of more advanced speckle
noise elimination strategies.<BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#WAM">WAM</a> 
Nowcasts<BR>
<BR>
During
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-1">SRL-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a>, 
 the Navy's Fleet Numerical Oceanography and Meteorology Center
(FNMOC) retained the nowcast spectra made from their version of the operational
   <a href="Acronyms.html#WAM">WAM</a> 

forecast model. An analogous comparison model data set is also available from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ECMWF">ECMWF</a> 

through collaborators at the Max Planck Institute (Hamburg).<BR>
<BR>

   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
Imagery<BR>
<BR>
Given the broad geographical coverage of data from the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#APL">APL</a> 
processor, there are at
least 30 times in each mission when
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
wave spectra and APL-processor image spectra
were located less than 50 km apart and acquired within one hour of one another.
Loosening the colocation criteria only slightly will produce more than 100 such comparisons
sets.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>SIGNIFICANT RESULTS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Using real-time APL-processor data received at Johnson Space Center, we merged
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 

wave vector estimates over the Southern Ocean with wave vector forecasts from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#FNMOC">FNMOC</a> 

and daily placed the combined products on a World Wide Web site. During the mission,
the site was visited more than 150 times by investigators from as far away as South Africa
and Australia. This effort demonstrated the potential of providing wave information
from spaceborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
quickly enough to be usefully assimilated into wave forecast
models.  The site<BR>
<BR>
<a href="ftp://fermi.jhuapl.edu/sirc/sirc.html">

</a><BR>
<BR>
currently shows recent data and analyses from the SRL missions. In the past year,
we have processed image spectra with only a simple
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
modulation transfer function.
Even these results show quality retrievals of wave direction and wavelength.  In
the future, we will employ more sophisticated retrieval schemes that may permit the accurate
measurement of ocean
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SWH">SWH</a> 
as well.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>FUTURE PLANS<BR></strong>
<BR>
Given the totality of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
image spectra,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
spectra and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#WAM">WAM</a> 
model estimates,
we intend to 1) make a definitive determination of what ocean wave parameters can
be extracted from spaceborne SARs and with what accuracy, 2) specify the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
satellite configuration which optimizes this retrieval, and 3) to demonstrate with a statistically
significant data set the value of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
for improved global wave forecasting.<BR>
<BR>
We are currently collaborating with William Plant, who while a visiting scientist
at the Max Planck Institute this last year, applied nonlinear retrieval algorithms
to estimate wave spectra from coincident
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
data.  We expect to submit
a joint paper in the upcoming year, documenting the comparison of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
derived
image spectra.<BR>
<BR>
We intend to extend our analysis to the North Atlantic, multipolarization and multifrequency
data set using the precision-processed
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data to confirm the relative contributions
of the various wave imaging mechanisms. In addition, we will use the data to test more sophisticated schemes to alleviate the effects of speckle noise in the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 

image.<BR>
<BR>
We intend to make a systematic comparison, wave system by wave system, to ascertain
systematic differences between
   <a href="Acronyms.html#WAM">WAM</a> 
model wave estimates and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
measurements for
the entire Southern Ocean data set.  We will then determine whether these differences
are due to input wind field errors, model problems and/or
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
wave imaging limitations.<BR>

<strong>1. Introduction</strong><BR>
<BR>
Remote sensing in agriculture has a number of inherent advantages with respect to
conventional data gathering methods since it can:<br>

<ul>
<li>Image a large area in a very short time.  
Thus the data possess a high degree of actuality
and have a high economic value.<BR>
<li>Provide area-wise information as compared
 to the traditional point-wise sampling techniques.
The ability to produce crop maps as
 well as statistics is considered particularly
important for crop studies at regional and local levels.<BR>
<li>Advance the distribution and timeliness of the
 thematic information that is essential
for the planning, policy making and management of agriculture.<BR>
<li>Act as a stratifier in that it can help stratify
 large regions according to land-use
or agroclimatological conditions.<BR>
</ul>

While active radar systems have demonstrated considerable potential in collecting
information over agricultural lands, the full-potential of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
systems has not yet
been realized due to the low dimensionality of the data recorded by existing earth-orbiting
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
systems such as
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JERS-1">JERS-1</a>. 
  These operate at a single frequency and polarization,
which limits their sensitivity to crop geometry and hence crop type, and condition.<BR>
<BR>
The two SIR-C/S-SAR shuttle missions provided the first opportunity to collect multi-frequency
multi-polarization images over a number of sites worldwide.  While the missions took
place at non-optimal times during the growing season (i.e. early and late) for agricultural applications in Europe, a number of images were taken over agricultural
areas characterized by distinct climatic conditions and soil types, different crop
types or similar crops but at different development stages and subject to varying
crop management practices.  The research at the Institut f&uuml;r Pflanzenbau has focused
so far on using this wealth of data in terms of the two basic aspects of agricultural
remote sensing; <CITE>the recognition of crop types</CITE>
over a large area on the basis of self-similar but distinct backscatter characteristics
for each crop of agricultural land-cover type and, <CITE>the mapping of the biophysical status</CITE>
of certain crop types.  Ground truth data was collected in three very different test
sites (Oberpfaffenhofen in southern Germany, Oltrepo Pavese in northern Italy, and
Matera in southern Italy) during the first mission and in two sites (Oberpfaffenhofen
again and Flevoland, Holland) during the second mission.  The general aim was therefore
to judge the sensitivity of the multi-dimensional
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
radar data to the biophysical
condition of crops and their utility for large scale agricultural inventories.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>2. Work in Crop Classification</strong><BR>
<BR>
So far classification work has focused mainly on data acquired during the April 1994
mission over the Oberpfaffenhofen test site, partially because better crop maps could
be compiled for this test site and partially because, until recently, data were lacking for the other test sites.  Two supervised classification methodologies have been
tested on a single full-polarimetric scene for the area; the maximum likelihood method
using the amplitude at the standard linear polarizations (X-VV, C-HH, -HV, -VV and
L-HH, -HV,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VV">VV</a>) 
 and the maximum contrast method which uses the complex covariance matrices
at C- and L-band.  Also the information content of each frequency/polarization feature
was evaluated by comparing the observed classification accuracy as a function of
features used in the classification process.  The following list summarizes the main
results so far.<BR>

<ul>
<li>Classification accuracies achieved for agricultural plots only (i.e. general land
cover categories such as urban areas, forested areas, water and road systems were
not considered) were quite high.  The main agricultural land cover types at this
time were ploughed and seedbed bare soil fields, winter barley, winter wheat, oilseed rape, meadows
and set-aside (fallow).  While there was some confusion between barley and wheat
fields due to their almost identical appearance at this time, average classification
accuracies, using the maximum likelihood classifier for the above categories, reached
80 to 90% in a number of cases -- depending on the frequency/polarization features used and the minimum field size considered.<BR>
<BR>
<li>By comparing the classification accuracies as a function of frequency/polarization
features used it was possible to derive a figure of merit for each feature and thus
assess which instrument configuration was most sensitive to agricultural features.
In general cross-pol polarizations contained more information than like-pol features and
L-band, with a higher between category dynamic range, was more useful than C-band.
Adding X-VV information to an L-band only and C-band only classification also improved
classification accuracies by 10.9 and 19.2% respectively.<BR>
<BR>
<li>The maximum likelihood classification methodology, using amplitude only images, proved
to be more robust than the maximum polarimetric contrast method, which uses both
amplitude images and information provided by the complex correlation coefficient
between
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HH">HH</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VV">VV</a> 
polarizations.  A plot of the complex correlation coefficient showed that
the latter contains little information on agricultural land cover type, except perhaps
to distinguish seedbed from the other categories.  This can be explained by the fact that crops at this time have little structure -- they are all more or less at a grasslike
stage -- and lack a distinct geometry.  It is expected that the HH-VV complex correlation
coefficient will play a more significant role when data taken during the second shuttle flight is analyzed since crops with significant structure such as corn,
sugar beet and potatoes were fully developed at that time.<BR>
<BR>
<li>The benefits of the added dimensionality of

data were demonstrated by
comparing the average classification accuracies as a function of the number of polarimetric
features used for the classification.  N.B. that these classification results (from a single image early during the growing season) compare favorably with multi-temporal

<STRONG>3. Mapping Crop Status<BR>
</STRONG>
<BR>
Much of the recent research has focused on quantifying the sensitivity of various
polarimetric features to the biophysical status of certain crop types.  A large database
was collected during the first and second missions containing the biophysical plant
parameters--biomass, height, water content, leaf area index, etc.--and soil parameters--density
and humidity--for a selected number of fields in each test area.  The suitability
of multi-parameter radar instruments such as SIR C/X-SAR was then judged by comparing ground measurements with the backscatter signatures for each field.  Initial results
are:<BR>
<BR>

<ul>
<li>No clear correlation between single channel backscatter features (single frequency,
single polarization) and crop biophysical parameters was observed.<BR>
<BR>
<li>The use of ratios, especially the L-HH/L-VV ratio, appear to be more promising.  The
L-HH/L-VV index appears to be sensitive to the presence of vegetation scattering
with respect to soil scattering. <BR>
<BR>
For relatively smooth seedbed fields, L-VV is greater than L-HH, as predicted by the
small perturbation model.  However as more vegetation is added on top (e.g., barely
early during the growing season) the interaction component which favors L-HH becomes
more important and the L-HH/L-VV ratio tends towards values greater than 1.  This is
illustrated at the end of this report.<BR>
</ul>

<BR>
<STRONG>4. Future Work<BR>
</STRONG>
<BR>
Over the last few months a nearly complete data set of reach test site has been delivered
by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#JPL">JPL</a> 
and the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DLR">DLR</a>, 
 posing a tremendous challenge to process and evaluate such large
data sets before the end of our project (December 1996).  However only a limited
number of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
scenes were taken in the full-polarimetric mode and since these allow
for a complete analysis of backscatter features, we will concentrate on using these
first, and move on to the other ones later.  Specific goals for next year are<BR>
<BR>

<ul>
<li>Inter-test site comparisons of classification results and backscatter signatures for
certain crop types.<BR>
<BR>
<li>Analysis of data collected during the second shuttle mission.<BR>
<BR>
<li>Classification of crop and land cover types in an unknown region (i.e., for which
no ground truth was collected by our institute).  Two candidate areas imaged during
the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
mission are:<BR>
<BR>

<ol type=1>
<li>Erdingen (west of Munich) where classification results can be compared to the official
agricultural statistics for the region.<BR>
<BR>
<li>Stra&szlig;bourg (France) in collaboration with SERTIT, who would provide us with the crop
maps after a classification of the area was carried out.<BR>
</ol>

Data on Montespertoli Test Site
</a></h1>
<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC2">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
Our analysis refers to Multi Look Complex (MLC) data, which have been
multilooked and usually resampled to a ground range projection. Two different
data products, depending on the polarization mode, have been provided by
NASA/JPL: quad-pol data, with 10 bytes per pixel, containing the information on
all polarization combinations and phase differences between polarizations;
dual-pol data, with 5 bytes per pixel, containing information only on two
polarization combinations and phase differences between them.  From the
software development point of view, it is important to point out that there are
many differences between
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
format data and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
format data, even if the
set of data by itself is very similar.  For X-SAR, the standard Multilook
Ground-range Detected (MGD) data products have been selected and were provided
by I-PAF.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Status
of data analysis
</a></h2>
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC4">The
Montespertoli test site
</a></h3>
<p>
The Montespertoli test site is located in Tuscany (Italy), a few kilometers
South East of Florence and has been selected as a
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
super-site. It is
a representative example of those Thyrrenian-Appennine slopes where bedrock is
made up of Plio-Pleistocene marine deposits and fluvial/lacustrine soft
sediments, which were intensively affected by geomorphological processes of
erosion and mass movements.  More than half of the site is hilly (the average
height is 250 m above the sea level), with some small forest areas, vineyards,
olive groves, agricultural fields, pastures, and small urban areas. The
remaining part is flat with alluvial wetlands of Pesa river, agricultural
fields and urbanization.  Two areas have been selected for ground truth
measurements:  a relatively flat area along the Pesa river, including
agricultural fields, which, depending on the season, may grow different crops
(mainly wheat, barley, alfalfa, colza, sorghum, sunflower and corn), bare
soils, and a small sub-basin of Virginio river.  The average field size is
about 4-5 ha.  The Montespertoli super-site was imaged on seven different days
with different incidence angles during both the April and October 1994
missions. Due to system limitations and compatibility with data takes over
other sites, fully polarimetric
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data were available only for four data
takes, i.e., 12, 13, 14, and 15 April, whereas dual-polarization data have been
provided for the remaining three.  A list of these data take segments is given
in Table 1.<p>

<a name="RTFToC5">Software

</a></h2>
<p>
The software developed and used for analyzing the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
data taken in the
course of the MAESTRO-1 and MAC-EUROPE '91 campaigns has formed the basis for
the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data analysis.  However, the mentioned differences between the

   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
and the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data formats and the fact that the previous software
had been developed under VMS and basic in a VAX environment, resulted in a
major effort to implement the adjourned algorithms in the recently available
UNIX/X-window Hp environment.  The main features of the developed software
include:<p>

<ol type=I>
<li>SAR data reading and image visualization;
<li>polygonal area selection with shifting capabilities;
<li>computation of average values of
   <ol type=A>
   <li>backscattering coefficients at each needed polarization state,
   <li>phase differences between polarizations,
   <li>correlation coefficients at relevant polarization states 
       within a chosen polygonal area;
   </ol>
<li>visualization of single or combined average values;
<li>creation of auxiliary input files.

<p>
A total of 98 polygonal areas (77 in the Pesa river sub-site and 21 in the
Virginio sub-site) have been constructed within the Montespertoli site.  Both
extensive and intensive ground truth data have been collected in correspondence
of the April and October periods of the Shuttle mission.  Data collections have
taken place on 7, 11, 13, 14 and 19 April and on 5 October, 1994.  Ground data
regard the soil and vegetation parameters which have a major effect on the
radar response of the surface, i.e.:<p>
<p>

<ol type=I>
<li>vegetation parameters:
   <ol type=A>
   <li>type of crop or grass
   <li>phenological state
   <li>fresh and dry weights
   <li>water content of leaves
   <li>water content of stalks and stems
   <li>leaf area index
   <li>cultivation geometry
   <li>dimensions of leaves
   <li>dimensions of stalks and stems;
   </ol>
<li>soil parameters:
   <ol type=A>
   <li>soil moisture profile (between 0 and 2.5 cm, 0 and 5 cm,
       and 5 and 15 cm)
   <li>soil density
   <li>soil surface rms roughness
   <li>soil roughness correlation length.
   </ol>

<a name="RTFToC6">Data
calibration and validation
</a></h2>
<p>
A first step consisted in the comparison of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
data with those taken by the

   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
on the same Montespertoli area in 1991 (MAC-Europe campaign), which
underwent calibration by means of corner reflectors and extensive validation.
At this stage of data analysis, backscattering values measured by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
L- and
C-band radar appear to be consistent with those of the MAC-Europe campaign.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC7">Data
analysis
</a></h2>
<p>
At present, the following quantities have been computed from the April
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 

data for each of the 98 polygonal areas selected within the Montespertoli
site:<p>

<ol type=I>
<li>backscattering coefficients at hh, hv, vv, rr, rl, 
    45 degree co-pol, 45 deg cross-pol;
<li>phase differences between hh and vv and hh and hv returns;
<li>conventional and new (circular polarizations and "scalar") correlation
coefficients 	for the fully polarimetric L- and C-band data.
</ol>

<p>
In the case of dual-polarized data, the computed quantities are consequently
and substantially reduced.  As far as SAR-X data are concerned, only a single
quantity can be computed from the radar data, i.e., the mean vv backscattering
coefficient. The computation of the X-band average values for the same surface
parcels for which the above L- and C-band quantities were obtained has been
carried out.  The request for the October mission data has been forwarded. <p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">Obtained
results
</a></h2>
<p>
The aforementioned large preparatory activity needed for the extensive and
systematic analysis of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data has absorbed a substantial fraction
of the manpower available for the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
project. At this stage, only
preliminary scientifically significant results have been obtained.  The L- and
C-band backscattering coefficients have been employed in a vegetation
discrimination scheme, and their link with arboreous and crop biomass has been
determined, thus establishing a further step towards the monitoring of
vegetation by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
sensors [1], [2]. It should be noted, however, that the
season of the flights was not favorable from this point of view, since only few
types of crops in spring and almost only bare soil in autumn were present.  A
study on the correlation with soil moisture content has also been undertaken
and results are now being obtained [5]. Inclusion of the April
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
and
October measurements into our backscattering database is planned to obtain
additional important multi-temporal information on the radar response to
vegetation and soil moisture [3], [4].<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC9">Future
activities and data requests
</a></h2>
As said, the October data have been requested and their analysis is planned to
follow the present April data study, adding relevant pieces of multi-temporal
information.  However, a real breakthrough in this field would be produced by
the availability of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data covering an extended period of time,
ideally one year, which would provide coverage of the whole cycle of growth of
vegetation and would span the entire hydrological cycle.  The possible launch
of a free-flier multifrequency radar, as already discussed by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#NASA">NASA</a>, 
 could
provide such a useful wealth of data of high interest for practical
applications of remote sensing technology.  Year-round systematic overflies of
the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
could partially replace the free-flier.<p>

1. Introduction<p>
<p>
Alenia Spazio has developed, on internal funds, a complete set of processing
tools to produce three-dimensional images of the observed area using two
complex images coming from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
sensors like
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a>. 
 This paper
describes the whole processing of the complex
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data to obtain  the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#3-D">3-D</a> 

representation of the image.<p>
<p>
In the frame of interferometric processing some steps have been pointed out:
the evaluation of range and azimuth shifts between the two images; the
filtering of the complex data in order to improve the coherence between the
images; the extraction and filtering of the interferogram; the phase
unwrapping; the phase-to-height conversion. <p>
<p>
The whole processing has been tested and applied to images coming from

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
(and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a>) 
 on Monte Etna in Sicily, in order to evaluate the
eventual differences between the two kinds of sensors in terms of radar
wavelength, baseline, and repetition time of the images.
<p>
<a name="RTFToC1">2.
Shift evaluation and images registration
</a>
<p>
The registration of the two
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SLC">SLC</a> 
images is done using the following procedures,
after the removal of the coarse misregistration carried out by estimating the
pixel shift with the cross-correlation on the amplitude images. For the fine
(sub-pixel) registration we use the technique proposed in Lin, et al., 1991. <p>
<p>
<center>
<IMG SRC="gifs/Bombaci.Edited1.gif" align=bottom>
(1)<p>
</center>
<p>
The fringe fluctuation function (1) has been improved with respect to the
original algorithm by introducing pixel by pixel a weight factor derived from
the correlation matrix between the two images. Fig. 1 shows the results
obtained with the fringe fluctuation algorithm applied to X-SAR images coming
from Monte Etna in Sicily, during the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SRL-2">SRL-2</a> 
mission.
<p>

Complex images filtering
</a>
<p>
The objective is to improve the correlation coefficient and so to reduce the
phase and height noise observing that one of the causes of phase noise is the
relative shift of the reflectivity spectra of the two images. This is
principally due to baseline decorrelation.
<p
<a name="RTFToC3">3.1
Baseline decorrelation
</a>
<p>
It is well known (Rodriguez and Martin, 1991)<sup> </sup>that the spectra of
the received signals represent different terrain reflectivity bands. This is
due to the different angle of view of each pixel on the ground with respect to
the two points of observation. Calling q1 the view angle of a pixel for the
first antenna (platform pass) and q2 the view angle of a pixel for the other
antenna (platform pass) it has been noted that the same spectral components of
the signal coming from one acquisition is shifted by a frequency fW with
respect to the other, being:<p>

<p>
The  behavior  of  frequency  shift  versus local  slope is  plotted in Fig. 2
for  X-SAR  images.<p>
One can observe that 

f<sub><img src="/symbols/Omega.gif" alt="[Omega]"></sub>

increases with increasing terrain local slope.
Let us call "blind angles" those angles which cause an infinite shift. Moreover
if the terrain slope exceeds the off-nadir angle (layover) the absolute value
of 

f<sub><img src="/symbols/Omega.gif" alt="[Omega]"></sub>

decreases and it becomes negative.<p>


<p>
As seen this spectral shift depends on baseline and local slope and it causes
that  part of each image spectrum, exactly 

f<sub><img src="/symbols/Omega.gif" alt="[Omega]"></sub>

 width, that is not common
in the two images. When, extracting the interferogram, the spectra correlation
is performed, the result is noisy because of the correlation of these
not-common parts: hence the cross-correlation presents the following three
contributions: a peak at the frequency of perfect alignment of the spectra, a
sequence due to a common band in adifferent position, and a sequence due to the
cross-correlation between the not- common bands.<p>

<p>
It is important to remember (Prati and Rocca, 1993)<sup> </sup> that this
spectral shift is the cause of the fringe generation. The interferogram, hence
is described by<p>

<p>
with Ry range resolution. So we do not have to remove this shift, but only to
filter the not common parts of the spectra.<p>
<p>
To do this, because of the dependency from terrain slope, it is necessary to
estimate the shift  in a sufficiently small portion of image in which a
constant slope is supposed. In the following the processing of one subimage is
described. <p>

<a name="RTFToC4">3.2
Range Filtering
</a>
<p>
It  is  necessary  to design  two  filters with the same bandwidth and
different central frequency. These will be obtained by realizing a real
high-pass filter H(f) with
<IMG SRC="gifs/Bombaci.Edited8.gif">
and shifting the filter once on
<IMG SRC="gifs/Bombaci.Edited9.gif">
and once on
<IMG SRC="gifs/Bombaci.Edited10.gif">.<p>
After having estimated the spectral shift the project of filters is performed:
the high pass
   <a href="Acronyms.html#FIR">FIR</a> 
filter is realized with the Parks McClellan technique.<p>
<p>
To determine the optimum filter the Golden Section algorithm has been used: it
seeks the maximum of a function to find, varying the stopband from zero to the
stopband at -31 dB, the optimum stopband that maximizes the correlation
coefficient 
<img src="/symbols/gamma2.gif" alt="[gamma]">. 
It is interesting to note that if the scene is supposed
to be white and uniform, the correlation coefficient between the two images
correspond to the correlation coefficient between the transmitted signal and
the 

f<sub><img src="/symbols/Omega.gif" alt="[Omega]"></sub>

shifted one. <p>
So, the maximum detection algorithm can determine the optimum stopband that
maximizes the correlation between the transmitted signal filtered with the
centre on f<sub>1</sub>
 filter and the same signal filtered with the centre on 
f<sub>2</sub> and
shifted by 

f<sub><img src="/symbols/Omega.gif" alt="[Omega]"></sub>

filter. <p>

<a name="RTFToC5">3.3
Azimuth Filtering
</a>
<p>
The results obtained applying the processing described before to X-SAR and

   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
images lead to some observations.<p>
<p>
The azimuth spectra of the X-SAR present two different Doppler centroids. In
this case there is a common and a not-common part of the azimuth spectra and so
in X-SAR images also an azimuth filtering is necessary.<p>
<p>
In this case the Doppler centroids have been estimated and with the Parks
McClellan method a high pass filter has been projected with N=127,

Phase unwrapping
</a>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC7">4.1
Bidimensional analytical approach
</a>
<p>
The phase unwrapping is based on the well known weighted least-mean square
estimation of the phase from the phase differences. It has been implemented on
a general purpose computer for testing (maps of up to 4096x4096 pixels have
been processed and unwrapped), and as a basis for a next implementation on a
parallel computer.<p>
<p>
Another very promising technique is based on direct integration of the Poisson
equation coming from the derivation (second derivative) of the complex
logarithm of the interferogram. With the second derivative operation we have
reduced the problem to a well known one. Now, we have to solve the Neumann
problem with non-homogeneous boundary conditions: the first derivative along
the boundary has been previously calculated. Techniques and s/w programs to
solve the above problem are widely described in the literature. We use the
Fourier method to solve the homogeneous problem and then add the particular
solution for the boundary conditions.<p>
<p>


Two major practical points are: i) the calculation of derivatives; ii) the
presence of noise (i.e. corrupted samples). In our implementation we use the
Savitzky-Golay (S-G) smoothing filters for both computing the derivatives and
smoothing noise. The characteristic of the S-G filter is to use 
<i>c<sub>n</sub></i>
coefficients that preserve higher moments: for each point 
<i>f<sub>i</sub></i>, 
the least
square fitted polynomial to all 
<i>n<sub>L</sub>+n<sub>R</sub></i>+1 
points is computed, and g<sub>i</sub> is
the value of that polynomial at position <i>i</i>..<p>


<p>
The S-G filter allows us to compute directly the filtered derivative, simply
taking the n<sup>th</sup> derivative of the fitted polynomial and dividing
<i>g<sub>i</sub></i> 
by 
<img src="/symbols/Delta.gif" alt="[Delta]">
<sup>n</sup> 
(<img src="/symbols/Delta.gif" alt="[Delta]">
is the stepsize).

<a name="RTFToC8">4.2
Global classification approach
</a>
<p>
Why do some algorithms find a lot of difficulties in doing what the human
brain-eye system does in a very easy way?  A try to understand the
interpretation mechanism of human visual inspection of interferometric fringes
leads to a new method for phase unwrapping.<p>
<p>
The fringes, after their generation, are examined by a continuity tester which
performs a segmentation of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#2-D">2-D</a> 
fringe map into homogeneous areas. These
bidimensional segments are then grouped into classes, the result of which is
defined as connected sets of pixels having the same phase ambiguity.<p>
<p>
Finally the discrete ambiguity problem is solved against classes which are
mapped into a ambiguity matrix.<p>
<p>
This algorithm has been implemented on a conventional HP Apollo RISC machine
and results are 10 times faster than others if applied to L-band
interferometric data (SIR-C). The only drawback is that non-contiguous regions
(e.g. islands within the sea) cannot be uniquely assigned to an ambiguity map,
but this is a common problem in the phase unwrapping matter.<p>

<a name="RTFToC9">5.
Phase to height conversion
</a>
<p>
Most of the methods suggested in the literature need the knowledge of at least
three points on the ground of which height, position in image, and absolute
phase is known. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of  a global
interferometric mission to produce
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 
of the whole Earth surface and
especially of those areas about which the topographic data are unknown, a
method that reduces the a priori information is developed. Fig.3 shows the
typical geometry, where h(i,j) is the height of the pixel in the object,

<img src="/symbols/rho.gif" alt="[rho]">(i,j) 

its slant range distance, q(i,j) the off-nadir angle from which it
is observed, H the platform height and Re the Earth radius at the observed
point. The idea is to refer the analysis to the interferometer axis: to this
the off-nadir angle is equal to the tilt angle, that is the baseline attitude
with respect to cross-track direction. Along this axis the interferometric
phase should be zero: the interferogram phases are referred to this zero point
in terms of variation with respect to different off-nadir angles. So, the
interferometric absolute phase can be written as<p>

Deriving (7) with  respect to 

<img src="/symbols/rho.gif" alt="[rho]">,
<img src="/symbols/theta.gif" alt="[theta]">,

and h with H'=H+Re and
substituting (6) we obtain every image pixel (i,j) slope behavior  toward the
interferometric phase and slant range increasing distance (as function of
off-nadir angle), where

<IMG SRC="gifs/Bombaci.Edited21.gif">

(j is the range coordinate and

In this way it is possible to reconstruct
the height in the whole image knowing information of just one ground control
point and the unwrapped phases<b>, </b>with the simple implementation of a
linear equation in which the constant term is given by the attitude of the
interferometric system and by the reference point height. Moreover implementing
the same procedure to the wrapped phase one can obtain the phase behavior
without a flat terrain contribution, so that it is possible to know the level
contour lines on the image. Fig. 4 shows the level contour lines referred to in
Fig. 1.  Fig. 5 shows the corresponding

Multifrequency (and Multibaseline) Interferometry.
</a>
<p>
The multifrequency capability of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
system has been used to
improve the achievable performances of the final interferometric product. Two
techniques have been used: the first one to help the processing of the low
correlated X-band data; the second to improve the final sensitivity by the
fusion of the L- and X-band DEM's.<p>
<p>
The unwrapping of the X-band interferogram is difficult due to: i) the low
level of correlation affecting large areas of the examined scene; ii) the quite
large baseline which results in very narrow fringes where the slope is steeper.
To help the unwrapping process the L-band interferogram is first unwrapped,
then it is scaled (according to the wavelength ratio), registered, and
subtracted from the X-band fringes. The result (delta fringes) is an
interferogran at X-band with a few wide fringes which are easily unwrapped; the
result is then added to the previously subtracted interferogram giving the
final X-band product. The processing can be improved by weighting the  "delta
fringes" with the correlation map before unwrapping; obviously the result is a
merging of the L-band (where the correlation is low) and X-band unwrapped
phases.<p>
<p>
The second technique (only partially tested) uses the multiresolution analysis
(via the wavelet decomposition) to perform the fusion between the L- and
X-band. The X-band  and the scaled L-band  unwrapped phases are firstly
decomposed using the wavelet decomposition, then a final image is composed
using the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#HF">HF</a> 
components of the X-band and the LF components of the L-band.<p>

<a name="RTFToC11">7.
Conclusions
</a>
<p>
All the processing has been developed in order to realize a massive parallel
technique for a following implementation on a parallel computer. The results
are very interesting especially as far as the coherence improvement and phase
unwrapping are concerned. The trend is that of a greater use of the
interferometric technique to classify radar images using low noise coherence
images and to use the low noise fringes to develop a differential
Interferometry to detect small changes in the earth's surface.<p>

Two problems have been studied: IFSAR image registration and phase unwrapping.<BR>
<BR>
As far as image registration is concerned, an innovative procedure has been developed
and implemented: the raw data couple is processed with respect to a common reference
point, thus assuming accurate automatic registration with no need of image interpolation procedures. However, the two images are deformed: one is stretched and the other
is compressed; but these deformations are efficiently accounted for with a scaling
procedure. Experiments on real data validated the procedure.<BR>

Coming to the phase unwrapping, an innovative procedure has been developed and implemented.
The procedure is based on the first Green's identity, is robust as far as noise is
concerned, and limits the spread of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#DEM">DEM</a> 
errors due to phase undersampling or low
signal to noise ratio. Experiments on real data validated the procedure. In addition,
new innovative procedures based on a variational formulation of phase retrieval is
under investigation. <BR>

Interferometry: Summary of the Research Activities at POLIMI
</a></h1>
<p>
<p>
From 1987, the research activities on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data processing at POLIMI have been
mainly devoted to problem solving for specific
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
missions. Many problems stem
from the fact that the available satellite missions (e.g., SEASAT,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a>, 


   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-2">ERS-2</a>, 
 Radarsat) have not been  designed for interferometrical applications.
<p>
<p>
Here is a summary of the POLIMI activities on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data processing with
<i>present activities</i> in italics and<b> most recent research</b> in bold.
<p>
<p>
*	<u>1 - Phase preserving focusing</u>. A focusing technique (w-k) that
preserves the phase of the scatterers has been introduced in 1987 and tested on
SEASAT data [1, 2, 3]. It is now the basic processing used at POLIMI and many
other sites to focus satellite and airborne
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images to be exploited for
interferometric applications [4]. A phase preserving test suggested by
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ESA">ESA</a> 

shows that the phase dispersion and the phase constant term introduced by the
<img src="/symbols/omega.gif" alt="[omega]">
-
<img src="/symbols/kappa.gif" alt="[kappa]">
focusing are less than 0.1 and 10<sup>-4</sup> degrees
respectively. <p>
<p>
*	<u>2 - Doppler Centroid ambiguity estimation</u>. A blind deconvolution
technique for DC ambiguity estimation in the case of the {\bf SIR-C/X-SAR} data
[5] has been developed as well as a technique for efficient focusing of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 

data with time and space varying DC [6].<p>
<p>
*	<u>3 - Interferogram generation</u>. A software code made in POLIMI for
interferogram generation [11,10] from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-2">ERS-2</a> 
images has been
extensively tested at ESA-ESRIN and then distributed via Internet. Its features
include: <p>
<p>
- image registration within the limit imposed by coherence (e.g., 1/50th of a
pixel for coherence better than 0.4), <p>
- coherence map generation; <p>
- azimuth and range local frequencies (linked to terrain slopes) estimation;<p>
- local spectral shift filtering [7,8]; <p>
- fringe generation and filtering. <p>
<p>
Recent and ongoing research activities: <p>
<p>
<b>(3 a) - Quick-look interferometric processing</b> for ERS data (i.e.,
generation of interferograms and coherence maps of a 30 x 100 km area with a
100 x 100 m resolution in about 8 minutes on a typical low-cost workstation).
<p>
<p>
<b>(3 b)</b> - Optimization of the <i>tradeoff between local spatial resolution
and phase noise</i> of the interferogram. <p>
<p>
<b>(3 c)</b> - Study of efficient and <i>phase preserving interpolators</i> for
image registration in case of single pass interferometry (e.g., the envisaged
3rd
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
mission) where the theoretical coherence is close to 1. <p>
<p>
*	<u>4 - Phase unwrapping</u>. Both local (i.e., ghost lines) and global (i.e.
Least Mean Squares) techniques have been developed, compared, and combined to
get the unwrapped phase with the minimum interaction with the operator [11].<p>
<p>
Recent and ongoing research activities: <p>
<p>
<b>(4 a)</b> - Phase unwrapping using <b>multibaseline interferometric
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 

images</b>. <p>
<p>
<b>(4 b)</b> - <b>3-D target reconstruction</b> (e.g., getting resolution in
foreshortening and layover areas)  using multibaseline images [13, 14, 16, 18].
<p>
<p>
*	<b><u>5 - Phase preserving ScanSAR focusing</u></b>. A technique has been
developed for efficient phase preserving ScanSAR focusing [15, 17]. The
technique has been tested on Radarsat data simulated using
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
data.
Repeat-pass ScanSAR interferometry has also been analyzed and simulated using

   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
data. <p>
<p>
Recent and ongoing research activities: <p>
<p>
(5 a) - <i>Use of Radarsat data</i>. <p>
<p>
(5 b) - Phase consistent <i>block mosaicking</i> both in azimuth and in range
(subswaths).<p>
<p>
*	<b><u>6 - Combination of ascending and descending satellite passes</u></b>.
Ascending and descending interferometric
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a> 
passes have been exploited to
overcome the problem of foreshortening and layover due to the steep off-nadir
angle [12]. Foreshortening areas in one pass are well imaged in the other if
not in shadow.<p>
<p>
*	<u>7 - Differential interferometry</u>. Differential interferometry for
centimetric terrain motion estimation has been tested in different situations:
a landslide in St. Etienne de Tinee, subsidence along the Adriatic coast in
Italy and in the area of Pozzuoli (Naples) [19]. From a methodological point of
view a criterion for image selection and methods for differential phase
generation that do not need phase unwrapping have been identified.<p>
<p>
Recent and ongoing research activities: <p>
<p>
<b>(7 a) Use of the interferometric quick look for image browsing</b>.  <p>
<p>
*	<b><u>8 - Interference cancellation</u></b>. A technique for e.m.
interference cancellation has been successfully tested on
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
P-band airborne
images. <p>
<p>
*	<u>9 - Future activity: </u><cite>X-SAR boom motion compensation</cite>. One
of the main problems envisaged for the next
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
mission is the effect
of the 60m boom oscillations on the single pass interferogram generation
(especially in X-band). We plan to develop techniques for estimating and
compensating these effects from the data themselves.

<P>1. State of the activity<P>
<BR>
The research activity at the Department of Information Engineering of the University
of Pisa (Italy) has been mainly concerned with the definition of suitable processing
procedures for estimating the two-dimensional sea wave spectrum from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images [1].<BR>
<BR>
Classical methods proposed in the literature rely on the definition of a suitable
analytical relationship between the sea-wave spectrum and the corresponding
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
image
spectrum. This relationship accounts for the main effects contributing to the image
formation process, as for instance velocity bunching, hydrodynamic phenomena, tilting
of the local sea surface normal. In the most general case, the function relating
the two-dimensional sea wave spectrum to
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
image spectrum is non-linear, rendering
the inversion procedure a very complicated task. A solution to this latter problem can be
obtained by resorting to an iterative technique, based on the minimization of a suitable
functional. To this end, a sea wave first guess spectrum is assumed; then, this estimate is upgraded at each iteration till convergence is obtained. It is important to
note that the convergence of the algorithm strongly depends on the first guess choice,
which, in order to guarantee the effectiveness of the procedure, must be not too
far from the actual sea wave spectrum. This guess is usually determined through hydrodynamic
models or buoy measurements.<BR>
<BR>
The availability of experimental data, contemporaneously recorded with in situ measurements,
is of fundamental importance for testing and validating the aforementioned techniques.
Moreover, this comparative analysis may also suggest optimization and extensions of these spectral estimation methods. <BR>
<BR>
<P>2. Significant results<P>
<BR>
At a first stage, these techniques are being applied to areas of the Mediterranean
Sea. The attention is mainly devoted to the tuscan and ligurian coasts and in particular
to La Spezia and Genoa Gulfs, where <CITE>in situ</CITE>
measurements are available for our research group. These two gulfs represented a
test-site during the last two
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
missions, but unfortunately no data relevant
to this test-site were recorded during the missions. However, comparisons between
experimental and numerical results have been performed using images recorded by the European
satellite
   <a href="Acronyms.html#ERS-1">ERS-1</a>. 
<BR>
<BR>
A considerable part of the activity is devoted to the definition of efficient inversion
algorithms making use of a numerical simulator previously implemented. This latter
numerical code allows reconstruction of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
raw signal received by the spaceborne radar sensor in the presence of specific values of physical parameters as, for instance,
local wind direction and intensity, and possible presence of swell. It can be used
in the framework of an iterative inversion algorithm to provide a more accurate estimate of the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
image spectrum generated from an assigned sea wave spectrum [2].
This evaluation is needed at each iteration step and is usually performed by an analytical
transform. The introduction of this numerical tool may allow us to gain a deeper
physical insight into several phenomena contributing to the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
image formation process.
It is important to note that this can be obtained at the expense of an increased
computational cost which is essentially due to the time-varying character of the
sea surface. This latter aspect makes  numerical modelling very cumbersome. The simulation
code implemented is capable of describing the case of a Real Aperture Radar (RAR)
system as well. Consequently, to the end of validating the simulator, numerical tests
have been carried out, comparing their outputs with experimental data presented in the
literature [3], [4].<BR>
<BR>
<P>3. Future developments and data request<P>
<BR>
Concerning the next
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
mission, the acquisition of images of the sea surface
by a two-antenna
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
system is of remarkable interest for the applications under
consideration. Significant improvements in the above estimation procedures could
be obtained with such a system [5]. By extending the numerical simulator implemented, the
experiment could be simulated <CITE>a priori</CITE>
to analyze the advantages of this operating configuration and to test the effectiveness
of processing techniques. Later on, during the next mission, an <CITE>in situ</CITE>
measurement campaign could be performed for validating both processing and numerical
simulation. For these reasons, we are strongly interested, for the future developments
of this research activity, in the acquisition of data relevant to the La Spezia and Genoa Gulf test sites during the next
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
mission in a two-antenna
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a>

1. State of the activity.<BR>
<CITE><BR>
</CITE>
Our activity is mainly concerned with the detection and characterization of marine
surface films by means of multifrequency
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a>. 
 The activity outline was contained
in the Proposal &quot;Marine
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images at three frequencies&quot; for the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
missions.
This study represents the extension to the remote sensing of the methodology we developed to
characterize sea surface films by means of in situ measurements. The methodology
requires:  wave height measurements inside and outside the film covered area, derivation
of the their power spectra to obtain the spectral ratio, the best fitting of the latter
with the theoretical damping ratio [1] for the extraction of the rheological parameters.
In the remote sensing based methodology the first two steps are substituted with
a suitable analysis of multifrequency
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data.<BR>
<BR>
As far as the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
data are concerned we considered the quick looks of the

   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data of the April and October '94 missions. We selected some scenes of the Northern
Sea containing some slicks. We are waiting for the digital data of the same images
in the L-, C- and X-bands in order to refine the model for the detection and characterization
of slicks we developed using SAR-580 and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
images.<BR>
<BR>
During the flights of SAR-580 (October 1990) and
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
(June 1991) we collected sea
truth data. We measured:  time series of wind and temperature, of sigma zero by using
L, S, C platform based scatterometers, and of instant wave height<STRONG> </STRONG>
(up to 26 Hz) by using a microwave gauge [2]<STRONG> </STRONG>
installed on platform or on board of a small boat.<BR>
<BR>
In the above mentioned proposal we inserted another objective regarding the derivation,
from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images, of the spatial structure of the wind stress over the sea surface
for different meteorological conditions. Wind stress produces the sea surface roughness which, interacting with the incoming e.m. waves via the Bragg resonance, is responsible
for the radar backscattering. A study carried out so far on the data of the SAR-580
campaign [3] provided evidence of the capabilities of this kind of analysis and the wealth of information about the surface boundary layer that may be extracted by
the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
images.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>2. Results and publications<P>
<P><STRONG><CITE><P>
</CITE></STRONG>
The data processing of the SAR-580 campaign allowed us:<BR>
<BR>
a) to affirm that the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
signal attenuation in presence of sea surface films is in
tight connection to the measured damping of the wave components in Bragg condition
[4, 5, 6, 7] and then, that the presence of sea surface films can be detected by
means of
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
imagery.<BR>
<BR>
b) to obtain wind stress spatial distributions.  It has been possible, by studying
the radar backscattering structures, to infer the wind direction and evaluate the
lifetime of the wind stress bursts that create them. Furthermore, by analyzing the
tail of the backscattering structures (connected to the Bragg wave damping), we derived the
translation velocity of the wind stress structures. Finally we designed a model for
the wind vector extraction from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
imagery. This model is an improvement of a previous
one [8].<BR>
<BR>
The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#AIRSAR">AIRSAR</a> 
campaign data processing demonstrated that the role of the backscattering
due to Bragg resonance in the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
signal is prevalent over other backscattering mechanisms
for incidence angles between 16 and 61 degrees with
   <a href="Acronyms.html#VV">VV</a> 
polarization. From the P, L, C bands images of this campaign, by extracting the corresponding Bragg components
for each incidence angle, we obtained a wide portion of the high frequency sea spectra
inside and outside the film covered areas. We observed the same spectral trends obtained with the wave gauge. Spectral ratios obtained from remote sensing and by means
of sea truth measurements are almost coincident. This demonstrates the possibility
of detection and characterization of surface films by means of multifrequency
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 

images [9].<BR>
<BR>
These results are reported in the references 3, 7, and 9.<BR>
<BR>
<P>3. Future activity<P>
<P><STRONG><CITE><P>
</CITE></STRONG>
Our aim is the application of the described methodologies to some 1994
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 

data in order to tune models and methodologies we developed using the data of the
preparatory flights. <BR>
<BR>
While waiting for the 1997
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
mission we plan to perform a preliminary measurement
campaign in the Mediterranean Sea.<BR>
<BR>
Aims of the campaign are the following:<BR>
a) evaluation of the amount of wind energy transferred to the sea inside and outside
the film;<BR>
b) investigation of the aspects of the energy transfer from shorter waves, directly
wind coupled, to longer ones (in Bragg condition) which are responsible for the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 

backscattering.<BR>
c) investigation about the damping effects in the marine environment caused by concentration
and breaking for adsorption and spreading films respectively. We also plan to make
some artificial slick and surface measurements with ground based scatterometers, high frequency wave meters and to collect surface water samples for physico-chemical
analysis.<BR>
d) improving of the performances of the L, S, C scatterometer with a new single multiband
antenna and testing of the new Ku band scatterometer. Tune-up of the new multi wire
interferential microwave probe (10 GHz) for the measurement of bi-dimensional sea
spectra in the gravito-capillary region useful for the understanding of the relation
between backscattering and wave azimuth and possible spectral frequency shifts due
to sea currents.<BR>
<BR>
Such a campaign will be conducted in collaboration with several research institutions
(Univ. Torino, Univ. Firenze, CNR-Torino, CNR-Venezia).<BR>
<BR>
Finally we plan a second campaign in the Mediterranean Sea during the
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C">SIR-C</a> 
flight
with collection of all the needed sea truth data.<BR>
<BR>
The use of the three-band images will also permit us to extend the research on the
wind stress. It will be possible to extract the wind speed from the comparison between
the backscattering intensities, and, thanks to the Bragg condition, to retrieve the
pattern of the high frequency part of the wave spectrum. A study about the tail of the
backscattering structures at the three bands will permit the evaluation of the translation
velocity of the atmospheric structures. The planned experimental campaign will be useful in order to match the information of the time structure with that of the
spatial structure. This study will permit us to obtain from
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data the spatial
picture of the marine surface layer as well as an estimate of the fraction of area
covered by the wind stress structures at different atmospheric regimes.<BR>

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<h2>SAR Interferometry and Surface Change Detection</h2>
<hr>
<p></p>

<b>Executive Summary</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>It is now possible to detect subtle changes in the Earth's land and ice
surfaces over periods of days to years with an unprecedented scale (global),
accuracy (millimeter-level) and reliability (round-the-clock, all-weather).
The technique involves interferometric phase comparison of successive synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) images.  SAR data from the Earth Resource Satellite-1
(ERS-1) have recently been used to measure ice stream velocity in Antarctica,
coseismic displacement associated with the Landers and other earthquakes in
California, and volcanic deformation on Mt. Etna, possibly preparatory to a
major eruption.  This is the first time that the velocity or displacement
fields associated with these phenomena have ever been captured with virtually
complete spatial coverage.  These pioneering studies have generated enormous
interest in the Earth science community because they point to an entirely new
way to study the surface of the Earth.  <p>
SAR interferometry can also generate very high-resolution topographic maps.  It
is the key technique in a space mission currently under study by NASA to
generate global high-resolution digital topographic data, with a horizontal
resolution of 30 m and height accuracy of several meters.  <p>
A workshop was held in Boulder, Colorado on February 3 and 4, 1994 to consider
existing and new applications of SAR interferometry and to recommend ways of
enhancing the collection and distribution of data.  This report summarizes the
discussion and conclusions of each group and resulting recommendations, which
include:<p>
(1)	Better collection and distribution of SAR interferometry and topography
data from existing systems and archives.<p>
(2)	More research on temporal decorrelation, a process that currently limits
the use of change detection with SAR interferometry in some areas.<p>
(3)	A dedicated SAR mission optimized for detection of changes on the Earth's
land and ice surfaces, to be launched by the turn of the century.  <p>

<title>Introduction - SAR Interferometry and Surface Change
Detection</title></head><body><b></b><p>
<h1>I. INTRODUCTION</h1>
<h2>SAR Interferometry and Surface Change Detection</h2>
<hr>
<b></b><p>
It is now possible to detect subtle changes in the Earth's land and ice
surfaces over periods of days to years with a scale (global), accuracy
(millimeters), and reliability (day or night, all weather) that are
unprecedented.  The technique involves interferometric phase comparison of
successive synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.  Recent examples illustrate
how SAR interferometry can be applied to the study of glaciers, earthquakes,
and volcanoes.  Goldstein et al. (1993) measured ice-stream velocity in
Antarctica using Earth Resource Satellite (ERS-1) SAR images taken six days
apart.  It was the first time ice-stream velocity had been measured directly
from space without ground control points.  Massonnet et al. (1993) measured
coseismic displacement associated with the Landers earthquake based on ERS-1
images taken several months apart.  More recent results suggest that the
changes are detectable in images taken up to 14 months apart (Massonnet et al.,
1994) even without preexisting topographic data (Zebker et al., 1994a).  These
were the first complete pictures of earthquake-related deformation of the
Earth's surface.  Massonnet et al. (1995) measured surface deforma-tion at Mt.
Etna, an active volcano, with SAR interferometry.  Since surface deformation
may give clues to future eruptions at active volcanoes, the ability to make
these measurements from space without ground control is a fundamental advance
in our monitoring capability.  These pioneering studies have generated enormous
interest in the Earth science community because they point to an entirely new
way to study the surface of the Earth.  <p>
SAR interferometry can also generate very-high-resolution topographic maps.  It
is the key technique in a space mission currently under study by NASA to
generate global high-resolution digital topographic data, with a 30-m
horizontal resolution and height accuracy of several meters.  Over longer time
scales of several years or more, high-resolution topographic data can also be
used for large-scale change detection by comparing elevations at different
times.  This technique allows changes in glaciers and ice margins to be
assessed over long periods and any catastrophic topographic change to be
measured (e.g., volcanic eruptions, landslides, and major floods).  <p>
Many scientists are unfamiliar with SAR interferometry and its potential new
applications, and its technical limitations need to be more fully explored.
Thirty-nine scientists representing a broad range of Earth science disciplines
met in Boulder, Colorado, on February 3-4, 1994 to consider existing and new
applications of SAR interferometry and recommend ways to enhance the collection
and distribution of data.  After some general sessions, which included a
tutorial on the technique and a description of existing and planned radar
missions, attendees divided into six discipline-specific groups (volcanoes;
earthquakes and faulting; mountain building and erosion; ice sheets and
glaciers; hydrology, ecosystem studies, and environmental monitoring; and
technology) to discuss applications and make recommendations.  Each group
drafted an initial set of recommendations at the workshop for general
discussion, then worked on more detailed plans for the next 12 months.  <p>
This report summarizes the discussion and conclusions of each group and
resulting recommendations.  It includes a discussion of the theory and practice
of SAR interferometry in the general areas of topographic mapping and change
detection, major scientific applications, errors and limitations of the
technique, and recommendations on collection and distribution of SAR
interferometry data using existing data systems.  Last but not least, it
includes a recommendation and scientific rationale for a dedicated SAR mission,
optimized to detect changes on the Earth's land and ice surfaces, to be
launched by the turn of the century.  <p>

<title>Basic Priciples - SAR Interferometry and Surface Change
Detection</title></head><body><b></b><p>
<h1> II. BASIC PRINCIPLES OF SAR INTERFEROMETRY</h1>
<h2>SAR Interferometry and Surface Change Detection</h2>
<hr>
<p>
A great deal of discussion at the workshop focused on what is actually
being measured by SAR interferometry--specifically, how topography is estimated
from interferometry, the relative sensitivity of measured radar phase to
topography and <i>changes</i> in topography, the time span for detecting a
useful surface change signal in a specific environment, and what happens to the
surface during "temporal decorrelation," that is changes in the Earth's surface
that make it difficult to compare "before" and "after" images.  Before focusing
on these questions, we first review some of the basic principles of SAR
interferometry.  Our discussion is necessarily short; where appropriate, we
refer the reader to more detailed material.<p>
For a review of the principles of imaging radar, see Jensen et al. (1977) or
Elachi (1980) and references therein.  Briefly, imaging radar is an active
illumination system, in contrast to passive optical imaging systems that
require the Sun's illumination.  The illumination direction is side-looking
with respect to the vehicle's direction of travel.  The brightness (amplitude,
<i>A</i>) of a reflected radar signal (echo) that has been transmitted from an
antenna mounted on an aircraft or spacecraft, backscattered from the surface of
the Earth, and received a fraction of a second later at the same antenna, is
measured and recorded to construct the image.<p>
If we consider an image to be a set of values <i>A</i>(<i>x,y</i>) where the
<i>x</i> coordinate is in the direction of platform motion and the <i>y</i>
coordinate is in the direction of illumination, then the value of <i>y </i>
(related to the radar range) and its resolution is based on the arrival time of
the echo and the timing precision of the radar, while the value of <i>x</i>
(related to the radar azimuth) and its resolution depends on the position of
the platform and the beam width of the radar.  Since beam width is inversely
related to antenna size, small (physically realizable) antennas tend to
generate large footprints and their corresponding images have poor azimuthal
resolution.  Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) takes advantage of the Doppler
history of the radar echoes generated by the forward motion of the vehicle to
synthesize a large antenna, enabling high azimuthal resolution in the resulting
image despite a physically small antenna.<p>
Even though the typical radar image displays only amplitude data, for our
purposes the most important aspect of SAR is that it is a <i>coherent</i>
imaging system, retaining both amplitude and phase information in the radar
echo during data acquisition and subsequent processing.  SAR interferometry
exploits this coherence, using the phase measurements to infer differential
range and range change in two or more SAR images of the same surface.  We first
examine estimation of topographic height from the differential range measured
by two radar antennas looking at the same surface, followed by a discussion of
<i>changes</i> in topography (displacement) based on range change in two or
more succesive SAR images.  <p>
Estimation of topographic heights with SAR has been discussed by Graham (1972),
Zebker and Goldstein (1986), Li and Goldstein (1990), Rodriguez and Martin
(1992), and Zebker et al. (1994b).  Consider two radar antennas, A1 and A2,
simultaneously viewing the same surface and separated by a baseline vector
<b>B</b> with length <i>B</i> and angle <img src="/symbols/alpha.gif">  with respect
to horizontal (<a href="Report1.gif"">Fig. 2.1</a>).  A1 is located at height <i>h</i> above some
reference surface.  The distance between A1 and the point on the ground being
imaged is the range <img src="/symbols/rho.gif">, while <img src="/symbols/rho.gif">+<img src="/symbols/delta.gif"><img src="/symbols/rho.gif">is the
distance between A2 and the same point.  <p>

Fig. 2.1.  Basic imaging geometry for SAR interferometry.  A1 and A2 represent
two antennas viewing the same surface simultaneously, or a single antenna
viewing the same surface on two separate passes.<p>
<p><hr>
In this example, one antenna both transmits and receives the radar signal,
while the second is receive-only.  The phase difference is sensitive to both
viewing geometry and the height of the point <i>z</i>  above the reference
surface (<i>h </i>= 0 in <a href="Report1.gif">Fig. 2.1</a>).  If viewing geometry is controllable or at
least knowable to sufficient accuracy, then the topography <i>z(y)</i> can be
inferred from the phase measurement to a precision of several meters, assuming
we can solve for the 2 <img src="/symbols/pi.gif"> ambiguity inherent in any phase measurement. <b>

Finally, the measured quantity is the phase difference <i>f</i> between the two
antennas, and is directly proportional to <i>dr</i>, with constant of
proportionality 2p/ <img src="/symbols/lambda.gif">:<p>

<p>
The phase <i><img src="/symbols/phi.gif"></i>  in Eq. (3) is the fractional phase (value 0-2<img src="/symbols/pi.gif">
radians) leading to an ambiguity in range.  Additional techniques, such as
"phase unwrapping," are required to solve for the integer number of wavelengths
and obtain absolute range (see Goldstein et al., 1988).  <p>
Equations (1)-(3) can be combined to express the unknown topography <i>z(y)</i>
in terms of the phase observable and the radar system parameters, as follows:<p>
(equation 4)
<p>
<i>	z</i> <i>(y)</i> = <i>h</i>  - {[(<img src="/symbols/lambda.gif"><i><img src="/symbols/phi.gif"></i> /

/2<img src="/symbols/pi.gif">)}<i>cos<img src="/symbols/theta.gif">	</i><p>
<p>
Height estimates are averaged over a surface resolution element of the radar
image (often termed a picture element or "pixel"), typically tens of meters in
diameter.  <p>
To obtain reasonably accurate height estimates, how well do we need to know the
viewing geometry?  The uncertainty in height, <img src="/symbols/sigma.gif">z, is related to
uncertainty in orientation angle, <img src="/symbols/sigmasubalpha.gif">, by<p>
(equation 5)
<p>
	<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif">z = <i><img src="/symbols/rho.gif"></i> <i>sin (<img src="/symbols/theta.gif">)</i> <img src="/symbols/sigmasubalpha.gif">	<p>
For a spacecraft system where <i><img src="/symbols/rho.gif"></i> is large (at least several hundred
kilometers), Eq. (5) shows that the attitude error <img src="/symbols/sigmasubalpha.gif"> must be
very small to achieve acceptable height accuracy.  For example, to achieve a
height accuracy of 2 m from a 500-km-altitude spacecraft with <i><img src="/symbols/theta.gif"></i>
= 30deg., the attitude error must be no more than about 1 arc sec.  For an
L-band radar system with <i><img src="/symbols/beta.gif"></i> =  1 km, this implies a relative
position measurement accuracy (i.e., knowledge of the position of one antenna
with respect to the other) of about 5 mm.  This accuracy is feasible with
modern spacecraft-tracking techniques, such as the Global Positioning System
(GPS).  Errors in the baseline orientation cause errors in absolute elevation,
e.g., with respect to the center of mass of the Earth, but the relative heights
within the radar swath are largely unaffected.  This implies that a few ground
control points can be used to calibrate absolute height estimates even in the
absence of arc-second attitude information.  <p>
Now consider a single-antenna SAR system that revisits the same position and
images the same area on the ground after several days or weeks--the so-called
repeat-pass approach.  Assuming there has been no significant change in the
surface between acquisition of the two images, we can perform an analysis
similar to the dual-antenna case and recover an estimate of topography with
essentially the same accuracy.  Again, the key is knowledge of the baseline
length and orientation (vector <b>B</b> in <a href="Report1.gif">Fig. 2.1</a>) between the two antenna
positions; only in this case, it is the same physical antenna in a different
position at a later time.  <p>
Estimating topography from repeat-pass observations is obviously more
challenging than from simultaneous observations.  However, if the aircraft or
spacecraft is accurately tracked so that its position and orientation are known
as a function of time, the problem is tractable.  The analysis is nearly
identical to the case illustrated in <a href="Report1.gif">Fig. 2.1</a> except that, since each antenna
now acts as both  transmitter  and receiver, there  is a factor of 2
difference in  Eq. (3) relating phase and round-trip differential range to
account for round-trip distance (i.e., <i>d<img src="/symbols/rho.gif"> </i> =
<img src="/symbols/lambda.gif"><i><img src="/symbols/phi.gif"></i> / 4<img src="/symbols/pi.gif">).  We can still perform a phase comparison
on a pixel-by-pixel basis between the two succesive SAR images to recover an
estimate of average height within each pixel with this repeat-pass approach.<p>
But what if the surface has changed?  Can we still recover topography?  Can we
determine how the surface has changed?  The answer to these questions depends
on the nature of the change.  In the case where the relative positions of the
radar scatterers within a pixel changes by amounts greater than the radar
wavelength, we are out of luck--phase coherence will not be maintained in the
second image relative to the first, and we cannot peform a pixel-by-pixel phase
comparison between the first and second image.  We cannot recover topography
with the single-antenna system, nor can we say anything quantitative about the
nature of the change, beyond stating that it has been larger than some minimum
value.  However, if we had the foresight and resources to acquire our first set
of data with a dual-antenna system (thereby obtaining topography on the first
pass), we could at least perform a differencing operation on two independent
height estimates, obtaining displacement information precise to the
several-meter level.  <p>
Now consider a second case, where the only surface change is a large-scale
<i>coherent</i> change common to several adjacent pixels.  By this we mean
that, within a given pixel, the position of radar scatterers has not changed to
any significant degree, but the ensemble of scatterers (i.e., the entire ground
surface within that pixel, as well as some adjacent ones) has moved up, down,
or sideways in some correlated fashion.  Now we are able to perform a phase
comparison of the two images.  The differential phase contains information on
the range change to the radar antenna, thus providing information on the
surface change, precise to a fraction of a radar wavelength, or to a few
millimeters to centimeters for typical radars.  As discussed in more detail
below, to measure surface displacement to this precision requires a relatively
accurate <i>a priori </i>estimate of topography in the region and information
on the position and orientation of the antennas during each image acquisition.
<p>
One measurement of phase change based on two successive images constitutes only
one component of the three-dimensional surface displacement vector,
specifically the compo-nent projected onto the spacecraft-pixel vector.  In
this respect, it differs from the three-dimensional vector measured by GPS
geodesy.  The great advantage of SAR is that the observations are acquired with
virtually complete spatial coverage, rather than the sparse observations
inherent in conventional (including GPS) geodesy.  In principle, all three
compo-nents of surface displacement could be obtained from space; in practice,
we are only likely to obtain at most two, if data from both the ascending and
descending passes of the satellite are available.  Additional information
(e.g., from ground observations) would normally be required to determine the
full three-dimensional displacement field.  In practice, one or two components
will be adequate for most applications.<p>
We have said that measurement of surface displacement with SAR interferometry
depends on the nature of the surface change.  In fact, the conditions under
which SAR interferometry gives useful information on surface change is a major
topic of current research.  We can restate two important necessary conditions
for detecting and measuring surface change with SAR:<p>
<p>
(1)	Changes between successive images must not be too large, specifically the
displacement gradient across a pixel must fall within some value.<p>
<p>
(2)	The radar-scattering characteristics within each pixel must remain similar
in the time between the two image acquisitions, specifically the
root-mean-square (rms) position of the surface scatterers within a pixel must
remain constant within a fraction, say 10 to 20%, of the radar wavelength.<p>
<p>
The first condition is unlikely to pose significant problems, at least in
theory.  When it is violated because natural phenomena generate large
displacements and displacement gradients (e.g., volcanic eruptions,
landslides), simple differencing of before and after topographic data should be
adequate to define the changes to the degree of accuracy required for their
study.  Of course, obtaining such topographic data may be quite challenging in
a practical sense.  <p>
The second condition is more problematic.  When this condition is not met, it
is termed temporal decorrelation (Zebker and Villasenor, 1992), and it
constitutes one of the major problems for SAR interferometry.  Temporal
decorrelation precludes or makes difficult the phase comparison of the two SAR
images.  Temporal decorrelation has been observed on time scales as short as a
few hours in vegetated areas experiencing windy conditions.  On the other hand,
the initial result for the Landers earthquake (Massonnet et al., 1993)
demonstrated phase correlation over several months in a desert area with no
storms.  Subsequent studies indicated that phase correlation could be obtained
in this arid region over a period of 14 months, from April 1992 to July 1993
(Massonnet et al., 1994).  Zebker et al. (1994) and Peltzer and Rosen (1995)
describe phase correlation between images taken approximately one year apart in
Eureka Valley, California, also an arid region.  Qualitatively, we know that
desert is better than dense forest, dry conditions are better than wet, and
long radar wavelength is better than short, but much work remains to be done in
understanding this phenomenon.  The Boulder workshop identified temporal
decorrelation as a high-priority research topic.  <p>
With this as background information, we are now in a position to quantify the
concepts and conditions for measuring surface change.  Consider again two radar
antennas observing the same ground swath as in <a href="Report1.gif">Fig. 2.1</a> but at different times,
as in the repeat-pass mode.  The measured phase at each point in each of the
two radar images is equal to the sum of a propagation part, proportional to the
round-trip distance, and a scattering part due to the interaction of the wave
with the ground.  If each pixel on the ground behaves the same for each
observation, calculating the difference in the phases removes dependence on the
scattering mechanism and gives a quantity dependent only on imaging geometry.
<p>
For the repeat-pass case, we can rearrange Eq. (3) to express the phase
observable <i><img src="/symbols/phi.gif"></i>  as<p>
(equation 6)
<p>
	<i><img src="/symbols/phi.gif"> = (4<img src="/symbols/pi.gif">/<img src="/symbols/lambda.gif">)d<img src="/symbols/rho.gif"></i>	<p>
<p>
or 2<img src="/symbols/pi.gif"> times the round-trip distance difference in wavelengths.
Rearranging Eq. (2a) but neglecting <i>d<img src="/symbols/rho.gif"> <img
src="/symbols/2sup2.gif"></i> which is
small, gives<p>
(equation 7)
<p>
<i>	d</i><img src="/symbols/rho.gif"> ~ <i>B </i>sin<i>(<img src="/symbols/theta.gif">-<img src="/symbols/alpha.gif">) +
<i>B</i><img src="/symbols/2sup2.gif">/2<img src="/symbols/rho.gif"></i>	<p>
<p>
For spaceborne geometries, we can make the parallel-ray approximation (Zebker
and Gold-stein, 1986), ignoring the second term on the right-hand side of Eq.
(7)<p>
(equation 8)
<p>
	<i>d</i><img src="/symbols/rho.gif"> ~ <i>B </i>sin<i>(q-a)</i> ~ <i>B</i>ll	<p>
<p>
where <i>B</i>ll is the component of the baseline parallel to the look
direction. <p>
If a second (denoted prime) interferogram is acquired over the same area,
sharing one orbit with the previous pair so that <i><img src="/symbols/rho.gif"></i> and
<i><img src="/symbols/theta.gif"></i> are unchanged, we can compare the interferogram phases with
each other.  This second interferogram is acquired with a different baseline
length <i>B' </i>and baseline orientation <i><img src="/symbols/alpha.gif">' </i> thus a different
<i>B</i>ll'.  Combining Eqs. (6) and (8), we obtain<p>
(equation 9)
<p>
	<img src="/symbols/phi.gif">' = (4<img src="/symbols/pi.gif">/<img src="/symbols/lambda.gif">) <i>B</i>ll'	<p>
<p>
The ratio of the two phases<p>
(equation 10)
<p>
	<i><img src="/symbols/phi.gif"></i>  <b>/</b> 
	<i><img src="/symbols/phi.gif"></i> ' =  <i>B</i>ll <b>/</b> <i>B</i>ll'
<p>
is just equal to the ratio of the parallel components of the baseline, i.e.,
independent of topography, since radar wavelength is constant.<p>
Now consider two interferograms acquired over the same region as before but at
different times, so that ground deformation (due to an earthquake or volcano
swelling) has displaced many of the resolution elements for the primed
interferogram in a coherent manner.  In addition to the phase dependence on
topography, this time there is an additional phase change due to the radar
line-of-sight component of displacement <i><img src="/symbols/Delta.gif"><img src="/symbols/rho.gif"></i>.<p>
In this interferogram, the phase <i><img src="/symbols/phi.gif"></i> ' is<p>
(equation 11)
<p>
	<i><img src="/symbols/phi.gif"></i> ' = (4<img src="/symbols/pi.gif">/<img src="/symbols/lambda.gif">) (<i><img src="/symbols/beta.gif"></i>ll<sup>'</sup> +
<i><img src="/symbols/Delta.gif"><img src="/symbols/rho.gif"></i> )<p>
<p>
The surface displacement <i><img src="/symbols/Delta.gif"><img src="/symbols/rho.gif"></i>  adds to the topographic phase
term, which could create confu-sion in the interpretation.  However, if the
data from the initial unprimed interferogram are properly scaled and subtracted
from the primed interferogram, we can obtain a solution dependent only on
<i><img src="/symbols/Delta.gif"><img src="/symbols/rho.gif"></i> , as follows: <p>
(equation 12)
<p>
	<i><img src="/symbols/phi.gif"></i> ' - (<i><img src="/symbols/beta.gif"></i>ll/<i><img src="/symbols/beta.gif"></i>ll<sup>'</sup>
)<i><img src="/symbols/phi.gif"></i>  = (4<img src="/symbols/pi.gif">/<i><img src="/symbols/lambda.gif"></i>)<i><img src="/symbols/Delta.gif"><img src="/symbols/rho.gif"></i> 	<p>
Since the quantity on the left is determined entirely by the phases of the
interferograms and the orbit geometries, the line-of-sight component of the
displacement <i><img src="/symbols/Delta.gif"><img src="/symbols/rho.gif"></i> is measurable for each point in the
scene.<p>
Knowledge of antenna baseline length <i>B</i> and orientation <img src="/symbols/alpha.gif"> implies
accurate knowledge of the orbital parameters of the spacecraft and spacecraft
orientation during each image acquisition.  However, current orbital systems
are not designed with interferometry specifically in mind and lack the
technology to provide the requisite data.  Massonnet et al. (1993) tested a
number of satellite passes before finding two with optimum characteristics,
then adjusted the orbital parameter estimates to minimize coseismic offset far
from the fault.  It is also possible to match displacement in the near field
with other geodetic data to obtain the necessary constraints.  In the future,
it is likely that orbital SAR systems will be specifically designed to
facilitate acquisition of interferometric data, and thus will include GPS and
other tracking techniques to provide accurate information on the position and
orientation of the platform.  <p>
It should be noted that optimum baseline length is a function of radar
wavelength and the desired result.  For surface change estimates, similar
imaging geometry in the before-and-after images is desirable, implying the
shortest possible baseline.  For topographic estimates, the baseline should be
neither too short (reducing sensitivity to surface height) nor too long
(causing geometric characteristics of the image to differ by too much and
preventing the phases of the two images to be compared interferometrically
because they are uncorrelated).  	Thus, an interferometer designed to recover
high-accuracy height estimates represents a compromise between these competing
effects.  Zebker and Villasenor (1992), Rodriguez and Martin (1992), and Zebker
et al. (1994b) discuss this and related design issues.  Briefly, for orbital
SARs, the correlation between radar echoes varies from unity (perfect
correlation) at zero baseline to zero (no correlation) at some critical
baseline, <i>Bc</i><p>
(equation 13)
<p>
	Bc = 
<IMG SRC="Report2.gif">
<p>
<p>
The optimum baseline length is less than <i>Bc</i> and can be determined by
minimizing the phase error, <img src="/symbols/sigmasubphi.gif"><p>
(equation 14)
<p>
	<img src="/symbols/sigmasubphi.gif"> =

<IMG SRC="Report4.gif">
<p>
<p>
and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the equivalent thermal SNR--it can contain,
for example, quantization noise terms.  For C-band (~6-cm wavelength) ERS-1 SAR
data, <i>Bc</i> is 1100 m, the optimum baseline is ~200 m, and antenna
separations of 100 to ~400 m can be used to obtain good height estimates.  <p>
It is important to assess the relative sensitivity of the phase measurement to
topography and displacement since the topography itself may be poorly known.
The relative sensitivity of the phase may be derived by differentiating Eq.
(11) with respect to height through <i>B</i>ll and displacement.  In the first
case, recalling that <i>B</i>ll<sup><i> </i></sup>= <i>B
</i>sin(<i><img src="/symbols/theta.gif">-<img src="/symbols/alpha.gif"></i>) in Eq. (8) and using <i>dz</i>  =
<i><img src="/symbols/rho.gif"></i>sin<i><img src="/symbols/theta.gif">d<img src="/symbols/theta.gif"></i>, obtained by differentiating Eq.
(1), we obtain:<p>
(equation 16)
<p>
<i>	d<img src="/symbols/phi.gif">' </i>= (4<img src="/symbols/pi.gif">/<img src="/symbols/lambda.gif">) <i>B</i> <i> </i>cos
(<i><img src="/symbols/theta.gif">-<img src="/symbols/alpha.gif"></i>)<i>d<img src="/symbols/theta.gif">	</i><p>

and<p>
(equation 17)
<p>
<i>	d<img src="/symbols/phi.gif">'</i>/<i>dz  </i>= (<i>B/<img src="/symbols/rho.gif"></i>) (4<img src="/symbols/pi.gif">/<img src="/symbols/lambda.gif">) [cos
(<i><img src="/symbols/theta.gif">-<img src="/symbols/alpha.gif"></i>)]<i>/ </i>sin<i><img src="/symbols/theta.gif">	</i><p>
<p>
For the displacement case, we have<p>
(equation 18)
<p>
<i>	d<img src="/symbols/phi.gif">'</i>/<i>d<img src="/symbols/Delta.gif"><img src="/symbols/rho.gif">  </i>= 4<img src="/symbols/pi.gif">/<img src="/symbols/lambda.gif">	<p>
<p>
Since <i>B</i>  (a few hundred meters) is much less than <i><img src="/symbols/rho.gif"></i>  (a few
hundred kilometers for a spacecraft system), it is evident from Eq. (17) that
<i>d<img src="/symbols/phi.gif">'</i>/<i>dz </i> is small.  Thus, the measured phase is much less
sensitive to topography (Eq. 17) compared to displacement<i> </i>(Eq. 18).
Comparing the two results numerically for the case of ERS-1, 1 m of
<i>topography</i> gives a phase signature of 4.3deg. (actually less than the
real noise limit of ~20deg., implying that ERS-1 is not sensitive to topography
at this level).  However, for the same pass pair, a 1-m surface
<i>displacement</i>  yields a phase signature of 12,800deg., or nearly 3000
times greater sensitivity.  Since we seek to measure 1-cm surface changes, this
implies that we require topographic data accurate to about 3000 x 1 cm, or
+/-30 m.  <p>
Massonnet et al. (1993) used a preexisting digital elevation model (DEM) in the
Mojave Desert that required only two satellite passes (one before, one after)
to measure coseismic offset.  The DEM for the Mojave region is representative
of digital topographic data in existence for most of the Northern Hemisphere
(90- by 120-m pixels, nominal vertical accuracy of 30 m); unfortunately, much
of it is classified and not available for scientific research.  Errors in the
DEM contributed about 9 mm of noise to the coseismic offset estimates obtained
by Massonet et al. (1993), where rms vertical errors in the topographic data
were estimated after the fact to be about +/-24 m.  Systematic errors in
selected areas can, of course, be much larger than this.  <p>
<a href="fig2.2.gif">Figure 2.2</a> shows an artifact of the estimated surface displacement in the
Landers earthquake study area (see next section) due to an approximate 250-m
systematic error in the topographic data.  Recall that this study area is a
"best case" example for topographic data because it is a well-mapped area in
the U.S. with relatively low relief.  Large systematic errors like this are
likely to be more common in areas of higher relief and throughout much of the
Southern Hemisphere. <p>

Feigl</i> [1995] attribute the feature to an error of ~250 m in the DEM.  One
fringe represents 28 mm of range change.<p>
<p><hr>
<p>
If high-quality DEMs are not available, the topographic data can be derived
indepen-dently by the SAR, although three passes are required (the first two
generate the height data, the third estimates the change).  Zebker et al.
(1994a) describe the estimation of the Landers coseismic displacement without
reference to<i> a priori </i> elevation data using the three-pass technique.
Adequate topographic data can also be obtained from TOPSAR, the NASA aircraft
SAR interferometry system (Zebker et al., 1992). <p>
At this time, topographic data of the appropriate quality for change detection
are not available for much of the Southern Hemisphere.  Thus, it will likely be
necessary to use the three-pass approach with ERS-1 and ERS-2 for those
observations to generate initial topographic data accurate enough for
interferometric change detection.  If one considers a space mission optimized
to exploit the change-detection capabilities of SAR interferometry, this
implies that the first part of the mission (the first 3-4 months) should be
devoted to acquisition of high-quality topographic data. <p>
Atmospheric effects are another source of systematic error in surface
displacement estimates from SAR interferometry because they change the
refraction index, through which the radar signal passes, and thus corrupt the
radar phase observable.  Tropospheric and ionospheric effects (<a
href="fig2.3.gif">Figs. 2.3</a> and
<a href="fig2.4.gif">2.4</a>) have both been identified in SAR interferometry images (Massonnet and
Feigl, 1995a).  Repetitive passes, such as afforded by ERS-1, are probably the
best way to separate atmospheric effects from true ground deformation.<p>

<title>Earthquake Studies - SAR Interferometry and Surface Change
Detection</title></head><body><b></b><p>
<h1> III. EARTHQUAKE STUDIES</h1>
<h2>SAR Interferometry and Surface Change Detection</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Each year, earthquakes cause thousands of deaths and billions of dollars
in property damage worldwide.  These numbers are bound to grow as populations
swell and are increa-singly concentrated along coast lines and mountain ranges,
which often represent tectonically active plate boundaries zones (Bilham,
1991).  Concerns about earthquake hazards have been formulated time and again
and documented in the U.S. and throughout the world.  Especially at risk are
critical facilities, such as conventional and nuclear power plants, hazardous
waste repositories, power transmission grids, transportation systems, schools,
hospitals, and so forth.<p>
The January 17, 1994 Northridge, California earthquake is now estimated to have
been the most costly seismic disaster in U.S. history.  It caused $20 billion
in immediate property damage and in lost business during the months that
followed.  Lost business was due to the reduced transportation infrastructure
(mainly bridge and freeway collapse) and associated delays, closed buildings
and factories, lost production, increased insurance rates, and the uncertainty
and loss of confidence by the business community.  Even a moderate event near
downtown Los Angeles during business hours, or a great earthquake along the San
Andreas Fault in southern California could lead to much more severe losses of
life and property, dealing a devastating blow to the socioeconomic structure of
the state of California.  The recent Kobe earthquake in Japan hints at the
magnitude of disaster when a large earthquake strikes an urban center.  With
over 5000 fatalities and damage estimates exceeding $100 billion, it may rank
as the most costly earthquake in modern history.<p>
Even though seismic zones have been fairly well mapped in this country and
worldwide over the past half century, society as a whole remains poorly
prepared.  Even California, which has fairly rigorous and well-enforced
building codes, has suffered devastating long-term economic losses from
moderate-size earthquakes in the last five years (Loma Prieta and Northridge).
One problem is that earthquakes occur infrequently in any given location,
confounding efforts to maintain a high level of preparedness.  While this is
largely a political/social problem, there are scientific issues as well.  <p>
In spite of decades of study and million of dollars of research funding, we do
not know in advance when or even where the next earthquake will strike.  In
some areas we know where they will probably occur, but in many places we do
not, either because the faults are hidden (such as the "blind thrusts"
associated with the<b> </b>1983 Coalinga, 1987 Whittier Narrows, or 1994
Northridge earthquakes) or because the tectonic regime is poorly understood
(such as the New Madrid seismic zone in the midwestern U.S.).  In some
instances, earthquakes strike where there is no historic record of any
significant seismicity--for example, the M = 4.6 earthquake near Reading,
Pennsylvania in January, 1994 and the September, 1993 earthquake near Killari,
India, which killed approximately 10,000 people.  In order to reduce the loss
of life and property in earthquakes, we need to learn as much as possible from
every earthquake that occurs.  This implies the need to study earthquakes on a
global basis, and also suggests the importance of space-based techniques.  <p>
SAR can provide high-resolution imagery of earthquake-prone areas,
high-resolution topographic data, and a high-resolution map of coseismic
deformation generated by an earthquake.  Of these, the last one is probably the
most useful, primarily because it is unique.  Other techniques are capable of
generating images of the Earth's surface and topographic data, but no other
technique provides high-spatial-resolution maps of earthquake deformation.  <p>
Crustal deformation is a direct manifestation of the processes that lead to
earthquakes. Consequently, it is one of the most useful physical measurements
we can make to improve estimates of earthquake potential.  <a
href="Report11.gif">Figure 3.1</a>
summarizes the temporal and spatial scales of deformation attached to various
earthquake-related processes.  In particular, it shows that the temporal scales
associated with the pre-, co-, and interseismic portions of the earthquake
cycle are very different.  <a h ref="Report12.gif">Figure 3.2 </a> compares the operative temporal and
spatial scales accessible through some of the techniques used to measure
deformation.  Space geodetic measurements initiated under NASA's Crustal
Dynamics Project (CDP) continue to be collected as part of a follow-on program,
named Dynamics of the Solid Earth (DOSE).  Many of these measure-ments span
tectonic plates and the plate boundary zones where strain accumulates and
earthquakes occur (e.g., Dixon, 1993).  In terms of hazard prevention,
preparedness, and/or relief, geodetic measurements can be used most directly to
assess the hazard of a given region. <p>
Unfortunately, current geodetic networks woefully undersample the deformation
field, especially in terms of spatial distribution.  A critical aspect of
crustal deformation is that, as we are able to refine our spatial sampling, we
find that deformation is spatially inhomogeneous, with most of the deformation
concentrated across relatively narrow zones.  Deformation also varies with
time, although the only well-documented time dependence to date is directly
associated with co- and postseismic phenomena.   In seismic zones, the spatial
density of points required to explain the sources of crustal deformation is
strongly influenced by the thickness of the elastic layer.  In the western
U.S., where the seismogenic zone extends to about 20 km, this translates into a
desired mean station spacing of no more than 10 km and probably less across
rapidly deforming basins and fault zones.  To shorten the time required to
estimate the  deformation  rate,  precise  repeated  measurements  are
required;  in some  cases,
where time dependence of strain accumulation is suspected, very frequent or
even continuous measurements are needed.  Better spatial sampling will allow
better resolution of short wave-length features of the deformation field.  It
will also help to solve the problem of nonunique-ness, inherent in estimating a
three-dimensional displacement field from two-dimensional surface
measurements.<p>

<p>
In summary, we need a global data set of densely sampled preseismic
observations to study earthquakes.  At the present time, no such data sets
exists, and no system is in place to provide it.  SAR interferometry has the
potential to provide that data set.  <p>
After an earthquake, SAR interferometry can be used to characterize the slip
that occurred at the surface (<a href="fig3.3a.gif>Fig. 3.3a</a>, <a
href="fig3.3b.gif">Fig.
3.3b</a>), slip from aftershocks (<a href="fig3.4.gif">Fig. 3.4</a>), and
slip distribution at depth. (<a href="fig3.5.gif">Fig. 3.5</a>).  In terms of disaster relief,
space-based observations--in the form of images or other data indicating areas
requiring the most attention--can also be used by relief workers.  SAR
interferometry has a potentially important role to play immediately after an
earthquake if processing times can be signficantly reduced.<p>

<p>
The most important scientific objective is to understand the earthquake cycle,
including the local peculiarities that arise because of different tectonic
environments.  Since earthquakes do not recur with sufficient frequency to
acquire the necessary data in a single location, we must resort to what might
be termed an "ergodic" hypothesis and study earthquakes worldwide, with the
idea of recognizing patterns associated with broad sets of geological and
tectonic circumstances, which presumably apply to other similar areas.<p>
An essential piece of information that still eludes us, even in thoroughly
studied and instrumented areas such as southern California, pertains to the
correct prediction of the locations of future earthquakes.  Satellite
observations can help in several ways.  First, remote sensing can help identify
subtle surface features that are not easily recognized from the ground  
(e.g., Blom et al., 1984).  Second, if the inhomogeneous character of surface
deformation can be explained, potentially dangerous geological structures can
be identified that might otherwise go undetected except through detailed
seismic imaging of the subsurface.  Perhaps the most important example pertains
to blind-thrust structures, which are difficult to recognize from surface
observations, yet give rise to damaging urban earthquakes such as the 1971 San
Fernando, 1985 Coalinga, 1987 Whittier Narrows, and 1994 Northridge events.  If
precise geodetic data can shed light on the spatial distribution of
accumulating strain--either through dense permanent GPS networks or SAR
interferometry images--then any hint that strain is accumulating faster in a
given area (e.g., Donnellan et al., 1993) would be important for devising
better observing strategies, selecting target areas for intensive geological
and geophysical study, and generally deploying our resources more
effectively.<p>
<p><hr>
<a href="fig3.3a.gif">Fig. 3.3a</a>.  Compare this observed coseismic interferogram for the Landers
earthquake [<i>Massonnet et al.</i>, 1993] with the synthetic interferogram in

<p><hr>
For these reasons, it is necessary to acquire dense temporal and spatial
sampling of crustal movements.  Satellite techniques are especially well suited
to this job.  Continuous GPS monitoring is a well-established technique that
allows precise determination of crustal defor-mation on spatial scales ranging
from a few to a few thousand kilometers, and in temporal scales as short as a
fraction of a day.  Although SAR interferometry techniques offer unparalleled
spatial coverage (to tens of meters), they do not currently allow dense
temporal sampling.  However, with appropriate selection of orbital parameters,
adequate distribution of ground-station facilities, and improved raw
data-storage capabilities on the spacecraft, these techniques provide
essentially global coverage, allowing us to sample all major exposed seis-mic
zones in the world.  Even marine seismic zones may be indirectly observable
with the SAR technique, in the sense that geodetic observations in coastal
regions experiencing seismic-cycle strain accumulation and release may help us
understand subduction-zone earthquake processes. <p>
Finally, an issue has only recently emerged as a critical one--the need for
properly georeferenced data sets at all stages.  The use of Geographical
Information Systems (GIS) is becoming commonplace in the Earth sciences, as
well as in all aspects of land use management.  It is playing an increasingly
important role in emergency management and disaster relief activities and
offers the potential for much improved efficiency.  Again, SAR imaging with
precise orbit determination and attitude control permit rapid, detailed,
accurately georeferenced, and repeated mapping of large areas of the Earth in
all weather, day or night, even under circumstances where ground access is
difficult or impossible.<p>

In summary, we need a long-term sustained program of observations capable of
capturing the spatial and temporal scales of the inter-, pre-, co-, and
postseismic portions of the earthquake cycle.  With the large range of scales
represented by <a href="Report11.gif">Fig. 3.1</a>, this will call for a very flexible combination of
systems. <p>
SAR interferometry offers geophysicists their first opportunity to measure
surface deformation with continuous spatial coverage, yielding a completely new
view of earthquake-related ground deformation.  In the case of Landers-related
surface deformation (Massonnet et al., 1993, 1994; Peltzer et al., 1993; Zebker
et al., 1994a), several features have been identi-fied that would be very
difficult, perhaps impossible, to detect on the ground.  In particular, there
is evidence for a small (a few millimeters), heretofore unsuspected, amount of
slip along the Garlock and Lenwood faults (<a href="fig3.6.gif">Fig. 3.6</a>).  In addition, surface
deformation patterns associated with individual Landers aftershocks can be seen
in certain interferograms (<a href="fig3.4.gif">Fig. 3.4</a>).  Such evidence could not be obtained from
ground measurements without considerable luck.   <p>
Several aspects of the technique are worth mentioning: <p>
(1)	There is no evidence that the technique is more difficult to apply in urban
areas.  In fact, the town of Victorville, California lies in the middle of the
fringe pattern published by Massonnet et al. (1993) (<a href="fig3.3a.gif">Fig. 3.3a</a>, <a href="fig3.3b.gif">Fig. 3.3b</a> ) and does not
cause any degradation in the fringe quality.  This bodes well for application
of the technique to urban areas elsewhere, such as the San Fernando Valley area
affected by the Northridge earthquake. <p>
(2)	Detection of surface offsets, seen as fringe offsets, benefits from the
considerable areal averaging one can perform in processing the image.  This
means it is possible to map small integrated offsets that are distributed
across a zone several hundred meters wide.  Such offsets might be detected with
ground-based GPS networks, but could not be mapped without extremely dense
deployments, which are not economic-ally feasible at present.  We have already
mentioned the small amount of slip across the Garlock fault, perhaps associated
with the Landers earthquake, but more important is the unanswered question of
whether there was an offset across the surface trace of the Santa Susana fault
associated with the Northridge earthquake. <p>
(3)	A combination of techniques may be helpful to facilitate data processing.
For instance, the presence of precisely located GPS receivers or accurate
topographic data within the SAR swath, could help calibrate the image and find
the interferometric fringes with more ease and reliability.<p>

black lines; the rupture of the Camp Rock fault segment mapped in the field is

with slip observed in the radar interferogram are shown as solid white lines.
These secondary faults include segments of the Garlock, Lenwood, Old Woman
(OW), and possibly the Upper Johnson Valley (UJV) faults.  One fringe
represents 28 mm of range change. <p>
<hr><p>
(4)	Most earthquake studies to date using SAR interferometry have focused on
the well-studied Landers event.  Peltzer and Rosen (1995) and Massonnet and
Feigl (1995b) describe surface deformation associated with the M = 6.1 Eureka
Valley earthquake, which occurred in a remote region of eastern California on
May 17, 1993 (<a href="fig3.7.gif">Figs. 3.7</a> and <a
href="fig3.8a.gif">3.8a</a>, <a href="fig3.8b.gif">3.8b</a>, and <a
href="fig3.8c.gif">3.8c</a>).  In the future, SAR interferometry is likely
to play an increasing role in the study of earthquakes in remote regions where
no other surface deformation data are available.  <p>
(5)	Imaging geometry may not be favorable for study of a particular earthquake,
resulting in low SNR.  However it is possible to "stack" several such images in
order to improve SNR (Massonnet and Feigl, 1995b;<a href="fig3.8a.gif"> Fig. 3.8a</a>, <a href="fig3.8b.gif">Fig. 3.8b</a>, <a href="fig3.8c.gif">Fig.
3.8c</a>).<p>
(6)	Not yet achieved is the detection of secular strain in tectonic regions.
Recent results using image pairs taken as long as 14 months apart suggest that
such a goal is attainable, but the technique is likely to be valuable only in
rare cases, e.g., in arid regions where deformation is rapid and concentrated
in relatively narrow zones.<p>

<p><hr>
<p>
<b>The Need for Global Coverage</b><p>
The damaging effects of earthquakes occur more or less randomly along the
seismic zones that girdle the planet.  Because they do not occur often enough
in any one place to allow us to collect a large sample over a short period of
time, a global approach is required for their study.  One can estimate the
number of "interesting" events anywhere in the world (i.e., those that can be
studied with surface geodetic techniques such as SAR interferometry) from the
numbers of shallow (less than 70-km depth) earthquakes.  Using the worldwide
catalog for the period 1970-1991, and making the approximation that 30 percent
are on land, we arrive at the following estimates of events that could be
studied from satellites: <p>
(1)	There are about ten great earthquakes per year worldwide (with a surface
wave magnitude greater than 7), so we can assume there are three on land.
These earthquakes would typically have slip in excess of ~1 m on faults longer
than about 25 km.  Most would have surface rupture. <p>
<p>
<p>
(2)	There are about 60 to 70 large earthquakes per year worldwide (with a
surface wave magnitude greater than 6), depending on whether the reported
maximum depth used is 40 or 70 km.  Let us assume that about 20 occur on land.
These earthquakes would typically have slip in excess of ~0.5 m on faults
longer than about 10 km.  Some, perhaps half, would have surface rupture. <p>
Only a few of these events would result in a disaster, but all would be of
essential scientific interest if we are to make significant progress in
understanding the earthquake cycle.  This means that broad-based multinational
cooperation is critical and global coverage is required.  Clearly, space-based
observations would be valuable.<p>
<p>
<b>Recommendations and Priorities</b><p>
(1)	The SAR interferometry technique delivers unparalleled spatial density, but
only in areas where suitable scenes are available.  In order to contribute
significantly to earthquake and natural-hazard studies, we need much better
global coverage than is available through existing spacecraft, with a focus on
tectonic areas and denser temporal sampling.  <p>
	We envision a SAR mission capable of two separate modes of operation:  (a) a
monitoring mode in which global coverage is offered to guarantee that "before"
pictures are available in all areas of interest with reasonable repeat times;
and (b) a rapid-response mode to allow acquisition of "after" pictures shortly
after an event of interest.  The latter mode may require considerable
maneuverability of the spacecraft.  We note that precise orbit control (using
GPS) is a critical ingredient to any successful SAR interferometry mission.<p>
(2)	In spite of recent spectacular successes, there is still a need to continue
developing SAR interferometry as a technique to support systematic studies of
the Earth.  Much of this effort can rely on existing spacecraft and aircraft
capabilities.  For instance, preliminary analyses indicate that L-band radar is
preferable for such studies since the constraints on the interferometric
baseline are not as rigid, the instrument is cheaper to build, the power
requirements are not as severe, the accuracy is about the same, and temporal
decorrelation is reduced.  However, a full demonstration of these advantages is
desirable.  In particular, selected test sites with differ-ent ground covers
should be examined over time with different frequen-cies  (L-, C-, and X-band)
to better understand temporal decorrelation.<p>
(3)	As soon as possible, priority areas should be established where existing
data are examined and new data are acquired with existing systems.  A high
priority should be given to acquiring and archiving preseismic data.<p>
(4)	Laser altimetery can complement these studies by providing relatively
high-precision (~10 cm) independent measurement of the vertical component of
displacement.<p>
(5)	Existing topographic data should be declassified to provide good worldwide
coverage, allowing change detection with two-pass interferometry. <p>
<p>
<b>Specific Space Missions</b><p>
Specific space missions, including missions already planned for the near
future, must be considered within the context of existing capabilities.
Spectacular as they are for earthquake studies, the ERS-1 data used by
Massonnet et al. (1993, 1994) have several shortcomings: <p>
(1)	Current orbit control is inadequate, making it difficult to obtain image
pairs suitable for interferometric processing and leaving the spacecraft
somewhat at the mercy of orbit fluctuations.  Also, with the failure of the
Precise Range and Range Rate Experiment (PRARE) system, orbit determination is
not as good as desired. <p>
(2)	The areas available for study are too restricted, reflecting limitations in
data-recording capability (i.e., there are none), distribution of ground
data-reception facilities, budgets for replicating additional ground stations,
and spacecraft operational limitations that preclude full-time SAR operation.<p>
(3)	For earthquake studies, an L-band radar would be preferable. <p>
The SIR-C instrument addresses some of these concerns, although the low orbit
inclination (&lt;57deg.) precludes global coverage.  Also, the short duration
of the flights precludes serious monitoring capability except as a "proof of
concept."  In particular, it may be difficult to separate tectonic changes from
atmospheric or other effects.  Radarsat has the disadvantage that it does not
incorporate a precise orbit-determination capability, so interferometric
processing will be difficult at best.  Also its C-band wavelength, while
adequate for many studies, again falls short of an optimum system for change
detection.<p>
In summary, existing systems, while useful, fall short of the ideal system for
monitoring the Earth's surface for earthquake-related deformation.<p>
<p>
<i>We therefore recommend that a dedicated SAR interferometry mission be
launched by the end of the century, operate in L-band, include a laser
altimeter, and offer global coverage.</i><p>

<title>GLOBAL VOLCANO MONITORING - SAR Interferometry and Surface Change
Detection</title></head><body><b></b><p>
<h1>IV.  GLOBAL VOLCANO MONITORING</h1>
<h2>SAR Interferometry and Surface Change Detection</h2>
<hr>
<p>
While many volcanoes experience periods of unrest and deformation that
do not culminate in major eruptions, it is likely that many (perhaps most) of
the world's volcanoes that actually do erupt experience significant preeruption
surface deformation (Newhall and Dzurisin, 1988;<b> </b>Thatcher, 1990; Shimada
et al., 1990).  Thus, precise monitoring of surface deformation could lead to
accurate predictions of volcanic eruption.  However, very few of the world's
active volcanoes are adequately monitored for ground deformation at the present
time.  Lack of resources is an important factor but, even when substantial
resources are available, it is often difficult or impossible to acquire the
needed information with available techniques without putting field crews at
significant risk.  <p>
SAR interferometry has the potential to provide the requisite data.  Detection
of volcanic deformation at Mt. Etna with SAR interferometry (Massonnet et al.,
1995) demonstrates that the technique can work at least under some
circumstances.  However, many questions remain before routine monitoring of the
world's active volcanoes with SAR interferometry can be considered.  In this
chapter, we address how surface deformation data can be used for the very
practical benefit of eruption prediction and to address even more fundamental
scientific problems bearing on understanding magmatic systems.  We also make
some recommendations aimed at improving the utility of SAR interferometry for
volcano studies.<p>
The existence of a large surface-strain signal presaging eruption suggests that
accurate measurements of surface strain can be inverted to study details of
critical preeruption magmatic processes.  Experience in Hawaii, Iceland, and
Long Valley illustrates the "state of the art" in using high-precision geodetic
data to track the motion of magma at depth.  At basaltic volcanoes, such as
Kilauea in Hawaii, decades of study have succeeded in mapping their shallow
magmatic plumbing systems, including the location, size, and capacity of
reservoirs only a few kilometers beneath the surface (e.g., Yang et al., 1992;
Dvorak, 1993).  By tracking the progressive tumescence of these reservoirs,
volcanologists can anticipate most eruptions.  Linde et al. (1993) document in
great detail the evolution of an eruption at Hekla volcano in Iceland over
several days.  They used borehole strainmeters to track a packet of magma,
detecting the deflation of a deep reservoir and the corresponding upward motion
of the magma in a conduit, culminating in a surface eruption.  <p>
Reservoirs comparable to those detected in Hawaii and Iceland have not been
identified beneath most other volcanoes, and we understand much less about
their eruption processes compared to these classic basaltic systems.  The more
petrologically evolved volcanoes, such as calc-alkaline island arc volcanoes or
caldera-forming continental rhyolitic centers, tend to generate explosive
eruptions--the kind we would most like to predict.  The andesitic-to-sili-ceous
character of these volcanoes leads to higher viscosity magmas and higher
concentrations of volatiles (e.g., water, carbon dioxide, and sulphur dioxide)
making them much more prone to erupt catastrophically.  At Long Valley, a
modern eruption has not yet occurred, but leveling and trilateration over the
last two decades have defined the locus of deformation associated with recent
magma movement and permitted modeling of the size, shape, orientation, and
depth range of the magmatic body including dyke-like intrusions coming from the
main magma chamber (Savage and Cockerham, 1984; Denlinger and Riley, 1984;
Rundle and Whitcomb, 1984; Savage, 1988; Vasco et al., 1988; Langbein et al.,
1989, 1993).  Newer GPS measure-ments have begun to provide high-accuracy
three-dimensional measurement of surface defor-mation (Dixon et al., 1993).
Continuous GPS measurements from two permanent stations installed in early 1993
and late 1994 on the resurgent dome are providing data relevant for rapid
assessment of a volcanic hazard in the region (Mao et al., 1994; Dixon et al.,
1995; <a href="Report19.gif">Fig. 4.1</a>).    <p>
<b>Key Questions</b><p>
<b></b>At any active volcano, some key questions need to be addressed:  Where
is the magma today that will explode to the surface during the next eruption?
How can its ascent be tracked to further our understanding of the magmatic
plumbing system, the physical and chemical pro-cesses that result in eruptions,
and provide advance warning that an eruption may be imminent?  What causes
temporal variations in strain and episodic eruptions?  Is it mainly related to
variable rates of magma recharging into the base of the magma chamber, or does
it reflect episodic trapping and release of volatiles exsolving from the magma
(e.g., Dzurisin et al., 1990).  For most volcanoes, even for ones that are
fairly well monitored, we are a long way from answering these questions.  <p>
A satellite-based SAR system holds a number of potential benefits over existing
ground-based deformation-monitoring techniques for addressing some of these
questions.  First, preexisting ground control is not necessary for useful SAR
measurements to be made.   Ground-based geodetic methods require baseline
measurements to be made against which future observations are compared.  This
requires volcanologists to anticipate which volcanoes will become active in the
near future, a task that is virtually impossible.  Given that there are about
1,000 potentially active volcanoes in the world, it is not possible in the
foreseeable future to monitor them all with ground-based methods.  In addition,
some of the most dangerous volcanoes are those with very long repose intervals
that can lull inhabitants  and  volcanologists 
alike into a false sense of security.  With existing technology it is likely
that dangerous volcanoes will continue to go unmonitored.  SAR interferometry
can provide the necessary background coverage.  <p>

vector between station CASA at Long Valley caldera in east-central California
and station Goldstone, 305 km south-southeast, between April and November of
1994.  Error bars are one standard error.  The best fit line through the data
points indicates uplift of CASA at a rate of 30.7+/-5.5 mm/yr with respect to
Goldstone, in agreement with other measures of deformation within
uncertainties. The weighted root-mean-square (wrms) scatter of indi-vidual data
points (representing 24 hours of data) is 12.3 mm.  From Dixon et al. (1995).
<hr><p>
Secondly, SAR provides contiguous coverage over a broad area, whereas existing
methods provide data only at a limited number of points on the ground.
Existing techniques grossly undersample the deformation field, while SAR
interferometry is capable of mapping the entire deforming region around an
active volcano.  This broad and detailed spatial coverage provides important
information on magma migration and other processes at depth, thereby improving
our understanding of volcanic processes (<a href="fig4.2.gif">Fig. 4.2</a>) and perhaps our ability to
predict and understand eruptions.  <p>
Third, volcanic crises typically pose great risks to personnel on the ground,
inhibiting the collection of necessary data.  Remote-sensing techniques allow
crucial data to be collected for eruption forecasting, while minimizing the
hazard to scientific investigators.  SAR-based deformation monitoring would
complement information from seismic, geochemical, and other monitoring methods,
where they are available.  It is worth noting that deformation is likely to
precede measurable seismic activity in many cases--e.g., a rock must be
stressed before it fails
--suggesting that deformation changes may be the first indicator of an
impending eruption.  Furthermore, many remote volcanoes have no local seismic,
geochemical, or other monitoring systems in place.  <p>
<hr>
<a href="fig4.2.gif">Figure 4.2</a><br>
<IMG SRC="Report20.gif"><p>
<hr><p>
<a href="Report21.gif">Figure 4.3</a> indicates one aspect of the problem.  If a relatively shallow magma
chamber is the source of unrest, as is typical of many active volcanoes, then
surface deformation will be concentrated relatively close to the top of the
volcano--precisely the area that is most difficult to reach and most likely to
be dangerous in the event of an eruption.  Clearly, the ability to remotely
sense deformation would be an enormous boon to volcano studies.  <p>
Systematic monitoring of ground deformation at potentially hazardous volcanoes
around the globe should be our long-term goal.  SAR interferometry has the
potential to warn of impending eruptions, mitigating the impact on lives and
property.  For this reason, we strongly endorse a series of projects over the
next few years to test the suitability of SAR interferometry for volcano
monitoring and to determine requirements for future satellite missions, partly
or wholly dedicated to volcano monitoring.  We envision a global system in
which SAR images will be acquired and interpreted on a time scale useful for
forecasting eruptions, reducing loss of life and increasing our understanding
of volcanic processes. <p>

displacement rate vs. horizontal distance from the center of deformation.  For
a shallow (5-km in this example) deformation source that is typical of many
volcanoes, deformation decreases rapidly with increasing distance from the
source.  <p><hr>
<p>
While SAR interferometry holds tremendous potential for volcano monitoring,
there are important questions that need to be addressed in the next few years
before a worldwide moni-toring system can be designed and implemented or data
from it properly interpreted.  For example, can we reliably identify artifacts
that might be misinterpreted as volcanic deformation?  These artifacts could be
due to atmospheric effects (e.g., troposphere or ionopshere; <a
href="fig2.3.gif">Figs. 2.3</a> and <a href="fig2.4.gif">2.4</a>)
or bad topographic data (<a href="fig2.2.gif">Fig. 2.2</a>), all of which may yield quasiregular areas
of "pseudo-deformation" crudely analogous to expected volcanic deformation
patterns.  Early results from two flights of NASA's space shuttle in 1994
suggested rapid rates of volcanic deformation in Hawaii based on SAR
interferometry.  Later research failed to confirm the high rates, and suggested
that the anomalies were most likely associated with water vapor variation in
the troposphere.  Several approaches are available to identify artifacts and,
with more experience, we believe they will not pose a critical problem, at
least when repetitive coverage is available.  For example, multiple images of
the same area may allow discrimination of true volcanic deformation from
atmospheric effects, the latter being highly variable in both space and time.
Data from short-term missions, such as the Shuttle, will continue to pose
problems in interpretation.   <p>
A critical question is whether or not SAR images obtained at different times
from heavily vegetated or snow-covered volcanoes can be correlated, so that
interferograms that measure ground deformation can be constructed.  Results to
date suggest that coherent interferograms can be obtained in arid and semiarid
areas over months to years.  Much less is known about the time scales over
which surfaces decorrelate in other areas.  Many active volcanoes are covered
by snow and ice, at least seasonally.  Other volcanoes have significant
vegetation cover that may inhibit or preclude correlation of SAR images.  It is
presently unknown whether multipass SAR interferometry can be done on these
volcanoes, so a vigorous attempt to answer this crucial question is the highest
priority for study. <p>
There are a number of possible ways to overcome the surface decorrelation
problem.  First, some volcanic deformations are so large that useful
information can be obtained by differencing DEMs obtained by interferometry.
Space-based SAR can provide 10- to 30-m horizontal resolution and 1- to 3-m
vertical accuracy.  Before its 1980 eruption, parts of the north flank of Mt.
St. Helens moved as much as 2.6 m horizontally and 0.07 m vertically each day.
In these situations, useful data can be obtained even if there is total surface
decorrelation between SAR images acquired at different times.  For this method
to succeed, it is beneficial if the SAR system is capable of determining a DEM
with a single pass--either by having a dual antenna system or tandem
satellites.  <p>
Unfortunately, all volcanoes cannot be counted on to deform as rapidly as Mt.
St. Helens.  Also, it would be nice to have more warning of an eruption,
perhaps by studying the smaller precursor strain events that seemed to precede
the meters-per-day deformation at Mt. St. Helens.  To maximize opportunities to
measure small amounts of deformation, it will be important to determine the
rates of surface decorrelation on a variety of volcanic surfaces.  Minimizing
the time between passes will limit surface decorrelation.  This goal implies a
dedicated space mission optimized for change detection, including wide-swath,
high-accuracy knowledge of orbit parameters, and perhaps two (or more)
spacecraft.  Other alternatives include placing radar corner reflectors or
transponders on the ground or focusing on the bare flanks and tops that often
characterize some parts of active volcanoes.  The problem with the last two
suggestions, however, is that we lose the broad spatial coverage. <p>
<b>Experiments Needed to Address Key Questions</b><p>
The working group recommends that data be obtained from existing systems [i.e.,
ERS-1, the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite  (JERS-1), Topographic SAR
(TOPSAR)] to examine the question of surface decorrelation on volcanic
surfaces.  It is important that a number of different types of volcanoes be
studied--basaltic shields, stratovolcanoes, silicic calderas, and active lava
domes, and that a variety of climactic zones be investigated--arid regions,
snow- and ice-covered terrain, and rain forest.  Some form of deformation
monitoring is already underway at a number of volcanoes that we are suggesting
for study (below).  This list is not intended to be complete in any sense.  To
study these areas, we recommend the use of both satellite- and aircraft-based
SAR instruments and other techniques to assess the suitability of SAR
interferometry for volcano monitoring.  <p>
The group recommends obtaining the necessary technological support to obtain
data that will prove (or disprove) the utility of SAR interferometry for
eruption forecasting.  This  support includes installation of an ERS-1 ground
receiving station in Hawaii and selected other locations, improvements in
real-time navigation and control for the NASA DC-8 to extend the capability of
the TOPSAR instrument to perform repeat-pass interferometry, and support for
the required improvements in image processing.<p>
<b>(1)	Hawaii.</b>  The group strongly endorses the proposal to install a
ground receiving station for ERS-1 in Hawaii (scheduled for operation in 1995).
This would allow SAR images to be obtained from Hawaii 's two most active
volcanoes, Kilauea and Mauna Loa, as well as the rest of the Big Island where
surface conditions vary from arid desert to lush rain forest.  Both Kilauea and
Mauna Loa are known to be actively deforming.  Current rates of horizontal
deformation on the south flank of Kilauea are 10 cm/yr (Owen et al. 1995; <a
href="fig4.4.gif">Fig.
4.4</a>).  Since both volcanoes are currently being studied with a variety of
ground-based geodetic methods (leveling, tiltmeters, and GPS), ground truth is
available for comparison to SAR results.  It is worth noting that this effort
is much more concentrated on Kilauea than on Mauna Loa, partly for logistical
reasons that would not be a factor in SAR studies of this largest of Earth's
volcanoes.  <p>
	The upper slopes of Mauna Loa and the southwest flank of Kilauea are extremely
dry and devoid of vegetation, providing an ideal environment for SAR
interferometry.  Parts of Mauna Loa's lower slopes and Kilauea's east rift
zone, however, are largely covered by tropical rain forest.  Thus, two
different environments, one ideal, the other difficult for SAR interferometry,
can be examined on two nearby active volcanoes. <p>

earthquakes (0-5 km) are in red and intermediate-depth earthquakes (5-15 km) in
purple.  GPS velocities are based on measurements between 1990 and 1993.
Largest displacement is approximately 12 cm/yr.  Error ellipses at 95%
confidence.  From Owen et al. (1995).<p>
<hr>
<b>(2)	Augustine.</b>  This youthful island arc volcano is likely to produce
the next eruption in Cook Inlet, Alaska, probably within this decade.  On the
basis of the historical record at Augustine, the eruption will likely threaten
both coastal communities on mainland Alaska and commercial air traffic in the heavily
traveled  air  lanes  above.  The  upper  slopes  of  Augustine  are  devoid
of vegetation, but heavily snow covered during winter.  Augustine therefore
provides an oppor-tunity to test the feasibility of SAR interferometry under
conditions that prevail at many of the world's volcanoes, plus the likelihood
of capturing an eruption within the next few years.   Augustine is currently
monitored with a network of about eight seismometers, three permanent GPS
stations, and three electronic tiltmeters.  Augustine's geologic history is one
of vigorous dome growth for several eruptive episodes, followed eventually by
collapse of the steep volcanic edifice.  Many of the resulting debris
avalanches have reached the sea and generated tsunamis, most recently in 1883.
At least 11 such events have occurred during the past  2,000 years, with repeat
intervals of 150 to 200 years.  The 1883 tsunami caused wave run-up as high as
10 m over 100 km from the volcano.  <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>(3)	Aniakchak.</b>  This 10-km caldera formed at the summit of an andesitic
stratovolcano, part of the Aleutian island arc, during a very large eruption
about 3400 years ago.  Since then, the volcano has produced numerous eruptions,
including a series of violent explosions and formation of a lava dome in 1931.
Each of the postcaldera eruptions has produced magma that is chemically similar
to that erupted during the caldera-forming event, which suggests that a large
reservoir of silicic magma still exists in the upper crust beneath the
caldera--as well as the potential for another catastrophic caldera-forming
eruption.  High geothermal heat flux keeps the caldera free of permanent ice
and snow, so that essentially year-round observations by remote sensing may be
possible.  Currently, Aniakchak is not being monitored.  The U.S. Geological
Survey plans to establish a leveling traverse across the caldera during summer
1994. <p>
<b>(4)	Long Valley.</b>  At this restless caldera, intensive monitoring
programs already exist: subweekly geodimeter observations, continuous
tiltmeters, continuous GPS observations (<a href="Report19.gif">Fig. 4.1</a>), static GPS networks, and
leveling.  In addition, both TOPSAR and ERS-1 data exist that could be used to
test multiple-pass SAR for deformation detection.  The Inyo volcanic system
adjacent to the Long Valley caldera has erupted repeatedly during the last
40,000 years, most recently about 550 years ago.  Future eruptions will
threaten the Mammoth Lakes community and interstate travel though the area.<p>
<b>(5)	Misti, Peru.</b>  The city of Arequipa (pop. ~800,000) is built on the
southwestern flanks of this active volcano.  A fuming dome in the summit crater
of this  volcano shows periodic variation in the intensity of fumarolic
activity.  Recent mapping of this volcano shows a past history of episodic
explosive activity, as well as more recent lahar and mudflow hazard.  This is a
very dangerous volcano on which no current monitoring is being undertaken.  The
aridity of the region and its high altitude (base elevation ~3000 m) makes
Misti a very good target for SAR interferometry.  <p>
<b>(6) 	Sabancaya, Peru.</b>  Some 70 km to the north of Arequipa is Sabancaya,
which has been in eruption since 1989.  During this time, mudflows and ash have
been a constant hazard to the 30,000 inhabitants that live 15 km away and 2 km
below the volcano. In 1992, an earthquake (M 5.2) destroyed a village and
commu-nications just north of the volcano.  A rudimentary three-station seismic
network has been in episodic operation since 1990, but there is a real need for
an early warning system.  Like Misti, the aridity of the region makes this a
very good target for deformation studies using SAR interferometry.<p>
Of course there are many other possible targets around the globe, including
volcanoes that have the potential to erupt explosively putting nearby
populations at risk, that can be studied with existing data.<p>
<b>Recommendations</b><p>
(1)	Perform research to assess the impact of temporal decorrelation on
SAR-based monitoring of volcanic deformation in a variety of environments.<p>
(2)	Install a ground receiving station in Hawaii for ERS data, and use it to
assess ground deformation and temporal decorrelation. <p>
(3)	Pursue a space mission for global monitoring and eruption forecasting of
active volcanoes.  Assuming moderate success in the first recommen-dation, SAR
interferometry holds the greatest promise for providing the requisite data. <p>

<title>HYDROLOGY, ECOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING,

Detection</title></head><body><b></b><p>
<h1>V.  HYDROLOGY, ECOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING,
AND GLOBAL CHANGE</h1>
<h2>SAR Interferometry and Surface Change Detection</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The topics described in this chapter span an enormous variety and are
too numerous to discuss in any detail here.  Instead, we briefly describe a few
sample applications and their corresponding data requirements.  In many cases,
the changes of interest are quite subtle or take place over very long times,
and SAR interferometry may not be sensitive to them.  On time scales of years
to decades, meter-level or greater changes in topography may occur, but these
are not the primary "observable" for many of the studies described here.  Of
far greater importance is an accurate, high-resolution description of the
existing surface character and topography.  Thus, SAR has an important role to
play by generating high-resolution all-weather images, while the critical role
of SAR interferometry is generating high-resolution topographic data.<p>
Together, elevation, slope, and aspect (north vs. south facing) exert enormous
control on surface hydrology and ecosystems.  Especially in high-relief
terrain, topography influences intercepted solar radiation, precipitation and
runoff, evaporation, snow ablation, soil moisture, and vegetation type and
health.  Even in low-relief terrain, topography has signficant influence on
soil moisture.  Energy and mass-flux conditions determine the dominant types of
vegetation and their succession, and these fluxes are affected by topography
through combined influences of elevation, slope, aspect, and roughness.
Calculation of accurate short- and long-wavelength exchanges in mountainous
areas requires accurate information on neighborhood topography, including
distribution of local horizons for shading, scattering, and reradiation
estimates.  Topographic parameters determine the exposure of a landscape to
weather and sunlight at a given latitude and, thus, determine its microclimate.
By feedback mechanisms, vegetation itself influences energy and mass fluxes,
affecting not only local environment but also regional and global climate.
Thus, topography is a key element in the study of complex ecosystems.<p>
Existing topographic data are deficient in one or more respects for many of the
applications described in this chapter.  This is especially true outside of
North America, western Europe, and Australia, but even high-resolution digital
topographic data within North America may have tens of meters of error (Pike
and Thelin, 1989; <a href="fig2.2.gif">Fig. 2.2</a>), causing problems with the differencing
calculations necessary to derive slope and aspect.  For large regional and
global studies, the problem is compounded by the different vertical--and to a
lesser extent horizontal--data used, as well as differences in the original map
data from which most digital data are generated (e.g., different map
projections, styles, and accuracies).  This issue has been covered by several
recent reports (e.g., Burke and Dixon, 1988; Mueller and Zerbini, 1989; Rundle,
1990) and we will not reiterate it here, save to update or refine some of the
requirements for topographic data for the specific studies discussed below.  <p>
We also note that the Global Topography Mission, currently under study by NASA,
would alleviate the major deficiencies in the global topographic data base, and
we endorse that mission.  In the meantime, high-resolution topographic data
could be generated in some areas using data from ERS-1 and ERS-2, as well as
NASA's TOPSAR aircraft, all of which should be pursued.  Release of topographic
data currently embargoed by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) should also be
vigorously pursued.  Although the accuracy of such data is often exaggerated,
it is all that is available in many regions.  Since the current plan for the
Global Topography Mission includes the use of a laser altimeter, we have called
out applications that would benefit from those data as well where
appropriate.<p>
<b>Basin and Landform Evolution</b><p>
<b></b>Landforms and stream-channel network geometry vary over a broad range of
spatial scales.  Space-based topographic data will enable us to acquire a basic
description of features with broad spatial scales, such as entire drainage
networks, that have been poorly served by the available data.  The ability to
accurately detect <i>changes</i> in topography will be especially useful for
studying geomorphic processes, such as progressive sedimentation or trenching
of alluvial fans, broad floodplain sedimentation patterns and delta exten-sion,
formation and movement of large dune fields, and large-scale development of
gullies--e.g., the type rapidly forming in steep, intensively cultivated
terrains in Asia, Africa, and South America.  <p>
The combination of landforms and stream networks in any region partially
controls hydrologic mass fluxes, such as water and sediment discharge in stream
and rivers.  What has not yet been achieved, but is possible in principle with
accurate space-based data, is a complete mass balance of fluxes of both water
and sediment through a drainage basin.  High-accuracy topographic and
topographic change data are the keys to assessing the sediment component.  The
extent of vertical lowering (related to the volume of material removed) can be
estimated with accurate topographic change data monitored over years to
decades.  Flow paths through the watershed can be accurately mapped from
high-resolution digital topographic data, while ancillary measurements of
stream sediment transported into the ocean complete the mass balance.  In this
way, subcontinental-scale erosion and depositional cascade can be assessed. <p>
The physical variables that determine runoff and sediment transport include
climate, vegetation, soil, and slope.  Landforms and channel network geometry,
readily calculated from DEM data (Marks et al., 1984) contain fundamental
signatures of these parameters.  Paleohydrologic analyses of river channels can
provide indicators of past climates and, therefore, of climate change (Bull,
1991).  Most of the empirical research on this topic has been limited to small
basins because of the extensive field work required.  As the use of
high-resolution satel-lite imagery becomes widespread, theoretical advances are
possible, including spatial analyses of channels and slopes .  The scaling
invariance observed in net-work geometries appears to reflect peak flows in the
channels and sediment flows that connect channel slopes and peak flows.
Careful tests of these theories will require a large data set from different
climates and spatial scales.  The combined topography and surface change
aspects of SAR interferometry, especially a space-based system, offer the
spatial coverage needed as well as the opportunity to get direct measurements
of a system in which a peak flow has recently occurred.  These data can test
our ability to see the long-term changes in network geometry that may result
from climate change.  They can also provide scientists with before-and-after
images of peak discharge events in stream geometry to help define those changes
and the stability of those changes over periods of several years after peak
discharge.<p>
<p>
<b>	Requirements</b>.  Horizontal: 10 to 100 m;  Vertical: 5 cm to 5 m; <p>
	Sampling: 5 days to annually;  Rate of change: days to years.<p>
<b>Stream Channel Evolution, Basin Flooding</b><p>
Stream channels respond on short time scales to regional events, such as
changes in discharge during flooding, and to local changes, including increased
runoff from urbanization.  Thus stream-channel geometry is a sensitive
indicator of change within a watershed.  As areas become increasingly
developed, the rate and volume of runoff increases since infiltration is
reduced and fewer plants are available to store and use the surface water.
This increase in runoff results in faster occurring, more frequent, and more
extensive flooding.  In turn, this change in stream dynamics produces an
enlargement of the stream channel because of increased erosion of the channel
during times of high discharge and lesser amounts of in-channel deposition
between flood events.  <p>
Predictions for the Midwestern floods during the summer of 1993 were based on a
detailed knowledge of that area's hydrological conditions and near-stream
topography.  For most of the Earth, such predictions are not possible because
key hydrologic parameters are not known and cannot be determined because of
logis-tical or financial limitations.  A combination of SAR images and laser
altimeter data should allow measurement of flood areas and river heights,
critical parameters for short-term flood assessment as well as longer term
understanding.  During the flight of any single spacecraft, there will probably
be extreme, peak discharge events on at least a small percentage of the world's
major rivers, providing a short-term assessment of changes caused by increased
or decreased flow, as well as intermediate-term recovery of the system towards
an equilibrium state.  Regardless of local weather, a series of SAR images may
itself be a great benefit, allowing observation of stream channel changes on a
frequent basis during flooding events. <b> </b><p>

<b>	Requirements</b>.  Horizontal: 10 to 100 m;  Vertical: 5 cm to 1 m; <p>
	Sampling: daily to annually;  Rate of change: days to years.<p>
<b>Soil Moisture</b><p>
<b></b>Soil moisture controls plant growth, the hydrological behavior of the
soil, and the ability of the soil to resist erosion.  Lower amounts of humus
and plant root structure in areas of sparse vegetation make these soils
especially vulnerable to wind erosion during periods of lower soil moisture.
The Sahel region in Africa illustrates the sensitivity to climatic variations,
ground water withdrawal, and overgrazing.  Seasonal changes in the Sahel
reflect the changing availability of water and show the effects of both short-
and long-term changes in the near-surface water budget.  Signifi-cant areas of
the western U. S. are characterized by semiarid conditions and show a similar
vulnerability to reduced soil moisture and increased erosion.  <p>
Soil moisture is strongly influenced by local topography, and the predilection
for saturation following rainfall events can be easily calculated from
high-resolution digital topographic data (O'Loughlin, 1986).  The amount of
moisture stored in the upper soil layer changes the dielectric constant of the
material and thus may affect the SAR return.  In fact, there is some evidence
that SAR can be used to monitor changes in soil moisture, at least in the
uppermost horizon.  The spatial and temporal coverage permitted by satellites
makes this a promising approach for measuring short-term, seasonal, and
long-term variations in soil moisture and for determining how these variations
affect primary productivity and erosion rates.<p>
<p>
<b>	Requirements</b>.  Horizontal: 10 to 30 m;  Vertical: 2 to 10 cm; <p>
	Sampling: 5 days to annually;  Rate of change: days to months.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Canopy Structure, Seasonal Changes, and Logging Impacts</b><p>
<b></b>Forests are crucial sinks and stores of carbon dioxide (CO2) and provide
a habitat for a wide variety of species.  Forests worldwide are being destroyed
or reduced by clear-cutting or selective cutting.  As a response to resulting
changes in sunlight and available nutrients, forested areas and plant species
within them experience changes in growth patterns and species distribution.
Secondary growth is vitally important to the long-term viability of these
forests because of its role in controlling soil erosion and related loss of
nutrients and its water absorption capability.  <p>
A laser altimeter is a possible complement to any space-based SAR system.
Together they can acquire data that could prove very useful for vegetation
monitoring.  The structure of the return laser altimeter pulse is partly a
result of the reflectivity of plants near the canopy top (<a
href="fig5.1a.gif">Fig. 5.1a</a>,<a href="Report23.gif"> Fig 5.1b</a>, and <a
href="Report24.gif">Fig 5.1c</a>).  Combined
laser altimetry and SAR imagery and interferometry can show areas of
clear-cutting as well as estimates of the rates of regrowth where extensive
logging has occurred.  As an example, the flanks of Mt. St. Helens have been
logged repeatedly, and areas of newest cutting and regrowth have been detected
with this approach.  A satellite-based system incorporating this technology
could provide global information on the gross style of vegetation cover and,
perhaps more importantly, changes in that cover. <p>

<b>Crustal Motion from Solid Earth Tides, Atmospheric Fluctuations, </b><p>
<b>and Tidal Loading</b><p>
<b></b>Both the solid Earth and the oceans respond to gravity perturbations
caused by the tidal potential of the Sun and the Moon.  For the solid Earth,
there is a well understood elastic component (the solid Earth tide), and a less
well understood component due to ocean-tidal loading of near-shore areas.
Ocean tides are reasonably well modeled by the laws of hydrodynamics (Parker,
1991).  These directly load the crust and induce a second-order gravitational
potential perturbation at the same tidal frequency.  The total effect of
ocean-tide loading produces distortions in the crust of up to 15 cm, especially
over continental areas near seas or oceans with strong ocean tides, such as the
European continental shelf (<a href="fig5.2.gif">Fig. 5.2</a>) and Patagonia.  The details of ocean-tide
loading, especially in areas of complex tidal regimes, are not well known at
present.  Typical wavelengths associated with tidal loading range from 50 to
2000 km.  Shorter wavelength response can also be expected near resonant seas
or bays (e.g., 
the Bay of Fundy, Gulf of Tonkin).  The signal magnitude, combined with
moderate wave-lengths, suggests that this phenomenon should be detectable with
SAR interferometry.<p>

Fluctuations in the atmosphere also load the solid Earth.  Though the
corresponding spectrum is continuous (from a few hours to several months), the
response mechanism of the solid Earth is the same as for tidal loading.  The
vertical ranges are a few centimeters, with typical scales corresponding to the
structures of the atmospheric pressure high and lows (100 to 1000 km) (see
references in Kakkuri, 1991, and VanDam et al., 1994).<p>
These various crustal deformations are very difficult to separate from each
other using conventional observing systems.  The tremendous spatial sam-pling
offered by differential SAR interferometry would permit true improve-ment,
rather than mere confirmation, of existing models.<p>

<b>Shoreline and Estuarine Processes</b><p>
<b></b>Coastal areas are a small percentage of total continental area, but are
very important economically.  We focus on two processes where high-resolution
topographic data and SAR imagery have an important role to play, namely coastal
erosion and the biological and geological processes taking place in tidal and
estuarine areas.<p>
Near-shore waves and currents redistribute sand and other materials along
coastlines.  These processes change the shore on a variety of time scales.
Storm surges are an important influence on the near-shore sand budget and can
cause large and rapid changes in shoreline.  Every year, storm surges remove
thousands of tons of sand over one to several days from beaches along the east
coast of the U. S.  More gradual changes over years to decades are also
effective at modifying the shoreline.  Seasonal changes in beach geometry are
well docu-mented, while longer term erosional and depositional cycles are less
well understood.  All these processes remove material from beaches and deposit
it both offshore and in navigable inlets.  Short- and long-term monitoring of
shorelines would allow a better understanding of the complex processes shaping
this economically important interface between land and ocean.  Even repeated
SAR images by themselves could be useful for studying these processes.  <p>
Near-shore topography is important in studies of shoreline biological and
geological processes, especially in estuaries and wetlands.  The water or soil
moisture available to support biological activity is affected not only by the
tidal changes in water level, but also by the microtopography, which can change
on time scales of days to months.  High spatial resolution is required to map
the subtle variations that influence the biologic and geologic processes of
interest.<p>
<p>
<b>	Requirements</b>.  Horizontal: 10 to 30 m;  Vertical: 5 to 30 cm; <p>
	Sampling: 5 days to annually;  Rate of change: days to months.<p>
<b>Subsidence</b><p>
<b></b>Many major cities are located in areas undergoing subsidence as a result
of withdrawal of ground water, oil or gas, and other minerals.  Several meters
of subsidence over several decades are not uncommon.  Examples of cities with
significant problems include Houston, Mexico City, Maracaibo, and Katmandu.
High rates of subsidence can have a major impact on flood control, utility
distribution, and water supply.  Subsidence is also a result of natural
processes such as limestone or marble dissolution that forms karst topography.
In western Pennsylvania, an underground coal fire has burned for many years
causing localized subsidence and threatening a much wider region with similar
risks.  Successive SAR images in urban areas over periods of several months may
be able to detect subsidence directly.  The surface structure of many parts of
urban areas remains unchanged over several years, suggesting that
interferometry over several years may be possible.  Subsidence rates of several
centimeters per year or more may be occurring in affected cities and should be
detectable.<p>
<p>
<b>	Requirements</b>.  Horizontal: 10 to 50 m;  Vertical: 2 cm to 2 m; <p>
	Sampling: monthly to annually;  Rate of change: months to decades.<p>
<b>Permafrost Conditions</b><p>
Permafrost areas are especially vulnerable to ecological damage because
biological productivity is low, rates of plant replace-ment or regrowth are
low, and root density is low, permitting rapid soil erosion.  Most areas of
permafrost have a lichen covering that serves as a critical food resource near
the base of the food chain.  Lichen cover is virtually the only biological
retardant for soil erosion and one that is easily destroyed.  Increasing
development pressures on these areas is common, often due to underlying mineral
wealth.  This is especially true in the former Soviet Union where the need for
hard currency is driving a development boom.  Destruction of the lichen or
other sparse plant life can lead to extensive damage to the ecosystem through
promotion of soil erosion, loss of primary productivity, and destruction of the
matted structure of the existing soil.<p>
Because of its sensitivity to ground cover and soil moisture, SAR imaging can
provide temporal sampling of permafrost areas under different weather
conditions to investigate seasonal changes as well as the impact of human
activities on plants and soil structure in permafrost areas.  SAR
interferometry may also prove to be useful.  The change in dielectric constant
of water prevents easy correlation of SAR images across the freezing point of
water.  However, preliminary results suggest that images can be correlated from
one period of freeze or thaw to the next (Zebker at al., 1994c).  Further
research into this possibility is important.<p>
<p>
<b>	Requirements</b>.  Horizontal: 10 to 30 m;  Vertical: 2 to 10 cm; <p>
	Sampling: monthly to annually;  Rate of change: weeks to decades.<p>
<p>
<b>Recommendations:</b><p>
<b></b>(1)	Questions concerning temporal decorrelation using available TOPSAR,
ERS-1, JERS-1, and SIR-C data need to be addressed.  The critical ques-tion for
a dedicated satellite mission for surface change detection concerns the
geographic and temporal breadth of its applicability.  Studies of grass-lands,
glaciated areas, and urbanized areas should be included. <p>
(2)	The ability to acquire, process, and interpret existing or soon-to-be
avail-able data (TOPSAR, ERS, JERS-1,SIR-C, Radarsat) needs to be improved.  In
particular, an expansion of processing capabilities for SAR data is crucial.
This should be accomplished by broadening SAR activi-ties at JPL, and by
preparing a portable version of the processing software to enable university
investigators and other groups to exploit SAR inter-ferometry.  Similarly,
Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) should be encouraged to continue and expand
their efforts to use laser altimetry in combination with SAR to study
topography and surface change.<p>
(3)	NASA should continue promoting the release of existing Defense Mapping
Agency (DMA) Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED).  <p>
(4)	JPL should investigate the technical possibility, trade-offs, and financial
implications of achieving 10-m horizontal resolution with a space-based SAR.
An increase in resolution from 30 to 10 m will greatly widen the applicability
of space-based data.<p>
(5)	Experiments combining multispectral SAR, laser altimetry, and ground truth
studies should be pursued to produce a better understanding of the TOPSAT
mission prior to final design.  We urge SIR-C, TOPSAR,    ERS-1, JERS-1, and
Goddard laser altimetry to coordinate their efforts to achieve this goal.<p>
(6)	We encourage the establishment of a science working group to help guide
future efforts related to the research goals listed above and the mission goals
listed below.  This group should include engineers, operational managers, and
scientists.<p>
(7)	NASA should seriously consider the dual-satellite L-band SAR mission for
launch in the 2000-2002 time frame.  The dual-satellite scenario presents the
greatest opportunity to accomplish the scientific goals presented in this and
previous reports. <p>
(8)	NASA should investigate a wide range of orbital scenarios to optimize
change detection for the extended portion of this mission.  These sce-narios
should optimize temporal coverage for large sections of the land surface, allow
response to specific events detected from SAR or other data, and provide polar
coverage.  <p>

<title> TOPOGRAPHY, TECTONICS, AND EROSION - SAR Interferometry and Surface Change
Detection</title></head><body><b></b><p>
<h1>VI.  TOPOGRAPHY, TECTONICS, AND EROSION</h1>
<h2>SAR Interferometry and Surface Change Detection</h2>
<hr>
<p>
<p>
Perhaps the most basic question we need to answer is "Why does landscape take
the form it does?"  Global digital elevation data are vital for addressing this
fundamental scientific issue.  We actually know much less about the surface
topography of the Earth than of Venus, due to the recent success of the
Magellan mission and the fact that two-thirds of the Earth is covered with
water.  Surprisingly, though, even the Earth's continents are less well
surveyed than Venus.  The need for global digital topographic data has been
nicely summarized in previous reports (Dixon and Burke, 1988; Mueller and
Zerbini 1989; Rundle, 1990), although little has been said about the need to
use these data to study erosional processes.  Accordingly, this is the focus of
this chapter. <p>
The Earth's topography ultimately reflects a balance between two competing
mecha-nisms, tectonics and erosion (see discussion in Harrison, 1994).
Continental denudation rates are controlled primarily by topographic relief or
slope, precipitation, climate, vegetation, and rock type.  Obviously, there are
many interrelationships between these factors.  For instance, topography can
produce microclimates that vary spatially over relatively short distances and
have an indirect effect on erosion rates through its control of climate.
Likewise, topography can control vegetation, with similar indirect effects on
the erosion rate.  <p>
Denudation rates from individual river drainage basins can vary by orders of
magnitude, but we are far from understanding the reason for this large
variation.  Currently, the only published explanation for the variation in 45
major river drainage basins (Milliman and Meade, 1983)<b> </b>involves the use
of average elevation as a proxy for the topographic control of denudation rate
(Pinet and Souriau, 1988).  Obviously, this does not explain very much of the
natural variation in denudation rate.  The classical model for erosion supposes
that the erosion rate is dependent on average elevation with a denudation rate
of 0.1 every million years (0.1/My).  This model gives an exponential decay of
elevation with a time constant of about 50 My.  A better job can be done by
assuming that the denudation rate is dependent on average elevation and
precipitation, but even this is a very simple-minded model of the immense
complexity with which topography controls the erosion rate.  Even after
allowing for both precipitation and average elevation, there remains
considerable variation in the 45 drainage basins' erosion rates that is not
explained in this simple model.  Much of this variation can be attributed to
the fact that average elevation is only a poor proxy for the way topography
controls the erosion rate.  <p>
Erosion tends to be catastrophic and localized.  Local erosional events such as
land-slides decorrelate the topography sufficiently to prohibit the use of
differential radar interfero-metry to study topographic change.  On the other
hand, local changes may be large and observable by simple differencing of
"before" and "after" DEMs. <p>
The first priority is to obtain an accurate, high-resolution global DEM that
can produce an accurate slope map.  These data allow us to assess how
topographic erosion control actually works.  Previous study groups have
suggested that 1- to 3-m vertical accuracy and 25- to 30-m horizontal
resolution is appropriate for many studies, although a 10-m horizontal
resolution data set would yield important new information.  For example, 10-m
horizontal resolution and 1-m accuracy for the primary DEM model would better
describe the surface spacing and size of important geomorphologic features,
especially hill slope variations in arid and temperate regions and river
terraces.  It would also have new commercial and engineering applications, as
well as geologic applications, e.g., potential identification of buried active
faults. <p>
Differential interferometry may not be able to detect major or minor erosional
events because of the previously mentioned decorrelation problem.  However,
there are several oppor-tunities for studying the balance between erosion and
uplift by investigating fold-and-thrust belts formed by subduction.  Belts in
Taiwan, Zagros, the Himalayas, and Papua, New Guinea are possible targets.
Determining the net uplift rates in these tectonically active areas would
provide a better idea of the time scales involved in mountain building. <p>
Models have been proposed in which there is a balance between denudation and
uplift.  If uplift does not occur, erosion will cause the topography to decay
after a few hundred million years.  This model was first proposed by Wise
(1974).  A modern example of the denudation/ uplift balance is the island of
Taiwan, as described by Dahlen and Barr (1989) and Barr and Dahlen (1989).
Taiwan is very active seismically and has a high average elevation.  Its
mechanical erosion rate is huge, more than six times the highest rate in the
world's other 45 river drainage basins.  Its chemical denudation rate is also
exceedingly high.  Taiwan's average erosion rate is about 3.9 mm/yr, with
higher rates over the central mountain belt--an average of about 5.5 mm/yr.
Uplift rates have been measured at several spots around the coast, and they
cluster close to 5 mm/yr.  Thus, Taiwan is an excellent place to study the
denudation/uplift balance because the uplift rates are in the correct
measurement range for differential radar interferometry.  One model of the
denudation/uplift balance makes the erosion rate linearly dependent on
elevation; if this is the case, the uplift rate along the ridge of the central
mountain belt would be considerably greater than the 5.5 mm/yr average quoted
above.  <p>
Taiwan is a natural laboratory for the study of erosion and uplift.  For SAR
interferometry, the only drawback is that much of the island is vegetated,
which could preclude direct uplift measurement due to temporal decorrelation.
However, radar corner cube reflectors could be used at selected locations to
give a series of point measurements.  While areas such as Zagros and the
Himalayas are drier and less vegetated, their uplift rates are lower and
measurable amounts of uplift would take longer to occur. And although the
uplift rates in Papua, New Guinea on the Huon peninsula may be even faster than
in Taiwan, they also suffer from the problem of vegetation.<p>
Because of isostasy (the general equilibrium of the Earth's crust maintained by
a yielding flow of rock material beneath the surface under gravitational
stress), high erosion rates over significant horizontal areas (i.e., distances
comparable to or greater than the regional isostatic compensation distance) can
effectively suck up material from the lower crust and/or upper mantle.  This
signal could easily be studied in Taiwan since the erosion rates are high and
detailed erosion rates have been calculated for various parts of the island.
<p>
Although earthquakes were already treated in an earlier section, we note here
that detailed geomorphic studies using primarily topographic data have yielded
significant advances, including the location of active faults, especially where
these faults are buried.  While geodetic methods may indicate that a region is
deforming, detailed geomorphic studies help to determine which fault is active
and point to promising sites for paleoseismic studies, a critical technique for
determining recurrence intervals.  In addition, detailed geomorphic data, when
combined with geochronology, can give a very accurate picture of long-term slip
rates.  <p>
These data are important because current topography is a direct reflection of
both tectonic (mainly constructional) and erosive (mainly destructive)
processes.  In areas where erosion rates are low and/or rates of tectonic
processes are high, it is possible to more quantitatively relate the observed
surface topography to the tectonics (e.g., Isacks, 1988).  One of the more
exciting prospects for high-resolution, high-accurancy digital topographic data
is that they can be inverted--either by themselves or with other geophysical
data--to constrain unknown tectonic processes of interest.  This application
would extend the use of digital topographic data far beyond its traditional
uses of comparing combined data sets or using statistics to quantify land
forms.  <p>
The basic idea is to pose a tectonic model in a form that predicts the
topography numerically, then test the model and constrain its parameters by
numerical comparison with the data.  The technique's power has been illustrated
by recent work on analogous marine data, namely sea-floor tectonic fabric
digitally imaged by acoustic systems like Gloria, Seabeam, or Seamarc (Shoberg
et al., 1991; Shoberg and Stein, 1994).  Obvious targets for land studies
include continental fold-and-thrust belts, such as the eastern Andes (Isacks,
1988), and continental extension zones, such as Afar (e.g., Acton et al.,
1991).<p>

<title>GLACIERS AND ICE SHEETS - SAR Interferometry and Surface Change
Detection</title></head><body><b></b><p>
<h1> VII.  GLACIERS AND ICE SHEETS </h1>
<h2>SAR Interferometry and Surface Change Detection</h2>
<hr>
<p>
<p>
Ice sheets, ice streams, floating ice shelves, and mountain glaciers together
constitute the cryosphere, an integral and dynamic part of Earth's
land-ocean-atmosphere system.  The cryosphere is sensitive to changes in mean
ambient temperature and precipitation on a wide range of time scales, thus
various components of the cryosphere are senstitive monitors of climate change.
While some components (e.g., the polar ice sheets) respond very slowly to
climate change, with response times of hundreds to thousands of years, other
components (e.g., mountain glaciers) respond rapidly, on the order of seasons
to decades.  This wide range of response complicates the definition and
implementation of appropriate monitoring strategies.  One feature common to
virtually all glaciers and ice sheets is that they occur in remote areas,
making satellite observations crucial. <p>
Although the polar regions are remote, they play a critical role in the Earth's
climate, ocean, and atmosphere system.  For example, it is widely known that
global warming could melt the Antarctic or Greenland ice sheets and lead to a
rise in sea level, with major impact on all coastal communities.  Less well
known is the fact that sea level could rise very quickly due to accleration of
ice discharge into the oceans.  The West Antarctic ice sheet is believed to
have an unstable character and holds sufficient ice volume to raise sea level
by 6 m (Alley and Whillans, 1991).  Consideration of dynamic response times
(Oerlemans, 1989) suggests that this could happen catastrophically, perhaps
over time scales a short as 100 years. <p>
Topographic data are basic to glacier and ice sheet research, because surface
topography directly reflects the driving and resisting forces that affect ice
motion (e.g., gravitational acceleration in the direction of surface gradient
and bedrock topography, respectively).  Unfortunately, no high-resolution
topographic maps exist of Greenland, Antarctica, and most mountain glaciers.
While lower resolution coverage exists, it is inadequate for many applications.
Much work is needed to acquire high-quality observations and to make the data
available to the scientific community in a standardized format.  Clearly,
satellite techniques have many advantages for acquiring complete high-accuracy
topographic data in the polar regions.  Images by themselves, whether optical
or SAR, are very useful for visualizing features, but quantitative elevation
data are needed for most scientific applications.  <p>
As soon as possible, we must determine whether total ice mass is stable,
shrinking, or growing.  High-resolution elevation data are critical to
determining total ice volume and ice extent and, when repeated after one or
several years, allow an estimate of the rate and nature of changes.  Monitoring
of the margins may be important in early detection of changes (van der Veen,
1991).  SAR interferometry has proven capable of detecting the grounding line
that separates floating from grounded ice in Antarctica, and should be very
sensitive to any changes (Goldstein et al., 1993; also see cover image).  If
height data are used to assess changes, it is important that basic elevation
data be as accurate as possible (at least 1-m accuracy, preferably 20 cm or
better) to enable accurate assessment of the rate of change after several years
of measurements. <p>
High-resolution elevation data are also important to the study of mountain
glaciers.  Because they are much smaller in volume than polar ice sheets,
mountain glaciers are much more responsive to climate change on short (10-100
year) time scales.  Mountain glaciers probably play a major role in sea-level
change (Meier, 1984, 1990), so repeated global measurement of glacier
topography is an important long-term goal.  At present, uncertainties in the
mass balance of mountain glaciers are sufficiently large that quantitative
modeling of their role in sea-level rise is difficult.  However, available data
are good enough to indicate that mountain glacier wastage plays a major
(probably dominant) role in sea-level rise.  The following is summarized from a
recent National Academy of Sciences report (Sea Level Change, NAS, 1990).<p>
The current rate of sea-level rise is estimated to be about 1.5 to 2.0 mm/yr,
with large contributions from the melting of mountain glaciers (~0.5 mm/yr) and
thermal expansion of the oceans.  The Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets
apparently contribute little to current sea-level rise, but this could change
in the near future.  Available data for several mountain glaciers suggest that
they are wasting at a rate sufficient to cause their disappearance within
several hundred years, and that the maximum melt rate has not yet occurred,
assuming present trends continue.  <p>
It is important to realize that there are several weaknesses in available data.
First, the number of mountain glaciers monitored is too small to be
representative, and there are good arguments to suggest that local variability
is large.  Secondly, due to their remote location, the data base is
particularly weak in the three regions containing the largest number of
mountain glaciers (the mountains bordering the Gulf of Alaska, Central Asia,
and Patagonia).  Finally, much of the data for ice mass change actually are
derived from length change, and the two quantities are only weakly correlated.
Changes in elevation are more directly related to mass change.  <p>
All three weaknesses can be remedied by space-based elevation measurements.
Since seasonal changes are large, monitoring elevation on a seasonal basis
would separate seasonal from longer term trends.  Meier (1990) suggests that
the magnitude of seasonal change may be correlated with longer term trends.
Thus, a short (2- to 3-year) space mission could yield data useful for
evaluating longer term trends, even in the absence of follow-on missions.  <p>
<b>Coverage Issues</b><p>
<b></b>One advantage of remote-sensing technology is that it enables study of
large regions of our planet that we know very little about.  One weakness in
the current ensemble of satellite data is that many satellite missions do not
cover polar regions, or provide only partial coverage.  Satellite missions
typically leave a gap of 8deg. latitude or more at the poles.  For example,
ERS-1 coverage extends to 82deg., while Geosat and Seasat extend only to
72deg..  Radarsat is planned to have a polar phase, but no altimetry
measurements are planned.  Clearly there is a need for satellite missions that
are better configured for polar studies.<p>
Satellite-based SAR interferometry has two important roles to play in polar
studies.  First, SAR interferometry can provide complete high-resolution
high-accuracy topographic data.  Second, repeat-pass interferometry can be used
to measure ice flow and assess other changes.  The cover image (from Goldstein
et al., 1993) shows the first direct measurement of ice flow velocity from
space without ground control. <p>
Much work remains before the full potential of this technique can be exploited.
Pilot studies involving SAR interferometry over snow and ice are required.
Specific questions must be answered:  How precise are SAR interferometry
measurements of height and ice velocity over snow and bare ice?  What are the
effects of scattering and penetration on the fidelity of interferograms, and
how does this depend on radar frequency?  What is the range of
correlation/decorrelation behavior over the range of microenvironments
characterizing the world's glaciers and ice sheets.  For example, the data
presented by Goldstein et al. (1993) on the Rutford ice stream was one of 12
examples tried; only two cases provided meaningful results.  Presumably,
changes in snow/ice surface conditions, including snowfall, blowing snow,
melting, and other temperature-related changes, affect the scattering and
reflectivity of the surface.  For mountain glaciers, high relief, high spatial
variability, and rapid temporal variation may complicate the acquisition and
interpretation of SAR interferometry data.  <p>
High-resolution topographic data can provide important secondary information
including surface roughness and scattering properties.  Using spatial
statistics, this information can be exploited to characterize morphological
prototypes, describe scaling properties, and derive classification maps (e.g.,
Herzfeld 1993; Herzfeld et al., 1993).  Repeated mapping missions, even in the
absence of correlation, can be used to assess large-scale changes through the
differencing of elevation measurements.  Examples include the advance/retreat
of glaciers, location of ice shelves (Partington et al., 1987), thickening and
thinning of glaciers, iceberg calving, ice-ocean interaction, motion of sea
ice, iceberg tracking, land subsidence, surges, and glacier velocity.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Recommendations:</b><p>
(1)	Pursue research aimed at better understanding of the temporal decorrelation
of SAR interferometry in polar regions and temperate mountain glaciers.<p>
(2)	Pursue a space-based SAR interferometry mission, ensuring polar coverage,
and acquire an accurate high-resolution global DEM.  The mission should include
a laser altimeter.  If feasible, use SAR interfero-metry data from this mission
to compute a global velocity field for the Earth's glaciers and ice caps, and
to compute changes in glacier and ice sheet elevation on seasonal to longer
time scales.  <p>

DATA-COLLECTION SYSTEM - SAR Interferometry and Surface Change
Detection</title></head><body><b></b><p>
<h1> VIII.  TECHNOLOGY: EXISTING AND PLANNED 
DATA-COLLECTION SYSTEM</h1>
<h2>SAR Interferometry and Surface Change Detection</h2>
<hr>
<p>
In this chapter, we begin by summarizing scientific requirements for digital
topographic data and surface change detection.  We review the characteristics
of existing topographic data sets and summarize their deficiencies.  Next, we
examine existing or planned space systems that have the potential to generate
topographic data, and suggest that all of these are weak in one or more key
aspects for the generation of high-resolution global topographic data and,
especially, surface change data.  Finally, we summarize the current state of
design studies for a space-based SAR system that has been optimized to collect
global high-resolution elevation data at meter-level accuracy and surface
change monitoring at centimeter-level accuracy. <p>
<p>
<b>Summary of Requirements</b><p>
<b></b>Farr et al. (1995) and Zebker et al. (1994b) reviewed the horizontal and
vertical resolution requirements for topographic data for various scientific
applications.  <a href="Report27.gif">Figure 8.1</a> emphasizes the wide range of these requirements (over
several orders of magnitude).  Nevertheless, some common features stand out.
First, some disciplines require very high-resolution topographic data with
horizontal resolution of only a few tens of meters (approximately the same as
current space-based imaging systems) and vertical accuracy of a few meters or
better.  High horizontal-resolution data with high vertical accuracy
automatically satisfy all lower resolution and accuracy requirements and thus
are highly desirable.  High vertical accuracy (a few tens of centimeters) over
the polar ice sheets is particularly important to enable mass balance studies.
<p>
Secondly, while high-resolution data are generally required only in specific
regions, these can be located anywhere on the globe, meaning that the data
should be obtainable anywhere.  Since this is virtually the same as a global
requirement, it emphasizes the desirability of space-based data acquisition. <p>
The third requirement is multitemporal coverage.  Even in the absence of
centimeter-level change-detection with SAR interferometry, high-quality
topographic data can detect meter-level changes over years to decades as long
as its accuracy is sufficient and acquired in a reasonably synoptic manner.
Clearly, a piecemeal data set acquired over many years makes change detection
difficult except on much longer time scales.  Thus, we need to acquire global
elevation data quickly, ideally in 1 year or less, as opposed to building up a
data base over 5 to 10 years, as might be feasible with stereo-optical systems.

<p>
The Boulder meeting concentrated on scientific requirements for change
detection via SAR interferometry, producing recommendations on appropriate
vertical and temporal resolutions.  <a href="Report29.gif">Figure 8.2</a> summarizes these concepts, along
with applications achievable by simple differencing of DEMs.  <p>
<a href="Report29.gif">Figure 8.2</a>.<b> </b>also shows current technology that could be used in these
studies.  It is feasible to acquire a near-synoptic global DEM in 3 months with
SAR interferometry.  For change detection via simple differencing of succesive
DEMs, the vertical change resolution is related to the vertical error of
successive DEMs, <img src="/symbols/sigma.gif">1 and <img src="/symbols/sigma.gif">2, and is just (<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif">1 +
<img src="/symbols/sigma.gif">2)<sup>1/2 </sup>assuming that <img src="/symbols/sigma.gif">1 + <img src="/symbols/sigma.gif">2 indicate true
accuracy and are not biased by systematic error.  At current levels of accuracy
for regional continental-scale data sets (15 to 30 m or worse; e.g., <a
href="fig2.2.gif">Fig. 2.2</a>),
change-detection accuracy is limited to tens of meters or worse, perhaps
several hundred meters, which is clearly inadequate for most applications.  In
the future, successive DEMs may be acquired from space several years apart from
platforms with much higher tracking accuracies, and better vertical accuracy
should be achievable.  We urge vertical accuracies no worse than 1 to 3 m for
any future global topographic mapping system and note that this requirement is
readily met with a dedicated space-based SAR interferometer.<p>
SAR interferometry can provide centimeter-level change detection over periods
shorter than several years, depending on local conditions.  The longest periods
(1 to perhaps several years) will be possible in deserts, while detection
periods will likely be much more limited in humid vegetated areas.  It is
important to note that differential interferometry requires a high-quality DEM
before centimeter-level changes can be detected.  <p>
<p>
<b>Currently Available Digital Topographic Data </b><p>
<b></b>Even though a substantial amount of digital topographic data is
available, global coverage is very inconsistent.  Many different mapping
organizations around the world produce and distribute elevation data, which
vary widely in scale, accuracy, format, datum, distribution policy, copyright,
royalty restrictions, and price.  Wolf and Wingham (1992) surveyed 352 mapping
organizations from 64 countries in their report on the status and availability
of the world's digital elevation data. Their report lists 50 different
topographic data sets, both raster elevation models and digitized contours,
that vary widely in resolution and coverage.  Data with a horizontal resolution
of better than 500 m are publicly available for only 10 percent of the global
land surface.  Some of the currently available global data sets are briefly
described below (see also Gesch, 1994).<p>
<p><hr>
<IMG SRC="Report29.gif"><p>
<p>
<a href="Report29.gif">Fig. 8.2.</a>  Temporal and spatial resolution requirements for surface change
measurements for a number of scientific disciplines.  Lower right-hand panel
shows existing and planned capability.  Note that SAR interferometry meets all
known requirements.<p><hr><p>
(<b>1)	ETOPO5.</b>  This is the highest resolution topographic data set with
global coverage that is publicly available (<Report27.gif">Fig. 8.1</a>).  The ETOPO5 data set has
elevations posted every 5 arc minutes (approximately 10 km) for all land and
sea floor surfaces.  It is distributed without restriction by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through its National Geophysical
Data Center (NGDC).  ETOPO5 was assembled from numerous sources having
disparate data and ellipsoid references, and the vertical accuracy is poorly
known.  The NGDC is updating ETOPO5 with improved source data and
documentation; the planned release date for the new version is 1995 (Row and
Hastings, 1994).<p>
<p>
<b>(2)	Digital Chart of the World (DCW). </b> The Defense Mapping Agency (DMA)
produced the DCW, a vector data base, by digitizing the 270 maps in the
1:1,000,000-scale Operational Navigation Chart (ONC) series, which represents
the largest scale base map source having near global coverage.  The U.S.
Geological Survey's (USGS) EROS Data Center (EDC) is processing the DCW
hypsography data to produce raster data at a grid spacing of 30 arc seconds
(approximately 1 km). Although many applications require a horizontal
resolution better than 1 km (<a href="Report27.gif">Fig. 8.1</a>), this data set will be useful for many
studies that require global or regional coverage at resolutions higher than
that currently provided by ETOPO5.  It will also serve as an interim global
data set until higher resolution global data become available.<p>
<p>
<b>(3)	Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED).  </b>DMA has produced DTED for
much of the global land surface, with coverage concentrated in the Northern
Hemisphere (Jenson and Larson, 1993).  DTED production continues, with
completion of a global data set anticipated in about 10 years.  These data have
a 3-arc-sec (approximately 90-m) elevation spacing.  For locations poleward of
50deg. north or south latitude, the longitude spacing between adjacent
elevation posts increases.  Accuracy requirements for DTED are 130-m horizontal
and +/-30-m vertical (Defense Mapping Agency, 1986) (<a
href="Report27.gif">Fig. 8.1</a>).<p>
	The DTED database is useful as a source of topographic information for some
Earth science applications, but access to data for areas outside the United
States is limited to Department of Defense organizations within the U.S.
Government.  Restrictions are also placed on the publication of derived
products and research results.  Distribution is also limited by international
agreements imposed by foreign governments who have cooperated with DMA on DTED
production (<i>Space News</i>, 1993).  Advocating the needs of the scientific
community, the USGS has initiated a series of discussions with DMA aimed at
facilitating the release and distribution of DTED, or generalizations of DTED,
to civilian scientists.  However, success so far has been very limited, and the
severity of the existing restrictions should not be downplayed.  One U.S.
scientist involved in an unapproved distribution scheme is currently being
prosecuted by the government and faces up to 10 years in prison (<i>EOS:
Transactions,</i> American Geophysical Union, vol. 75, p. 586, 1994).  <p>
<p>
<b>Current Capabilities</b><p>
<b></b>Only a space-based technique is able to provide an accurate, consistent,
Earth-center-of-mass-referenced global digital topographic data set.  Neither
the synoptic view nor controlled geometry of a space platform are attainable by
airborne or ground techniques, while problems of air space restrictions
disappear with a space platform.  <p>
<a href="Report27.gif">Figure 8.1</a> and Table 8.1 summarize the capabilities of several space-based
stereo-optical methods currently under evaluation for measurement of global
digital topographic data.<b>  </b>These include Syst&egrave;me Probatoire
d'Observation de la Terre (SPOT), the JERS-1 Optical System (OPS), the Advanced
Visible and Near-Infrared Radiometer (AVNIR) on the Japanese Advanced Earth
Observing System (ADEOS), and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and
Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) on NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS). <p>
Panchromatic SPOT images acquired with 10-m pixels have been used since 1986 to
produce DEMs of specific sites (e.g., Day and Muller, 1989).  The cross-track
pointing capability of SPOT allows the second image of the stereo pair to be
acquired as little as 2 days after the first.  The cross-track look angle can
be up to +/-27deg., resulting in base-to-height ratios of 0 to 1.  With
suitable ground control points (GCPs), SPOT DEMs at 30-m spacing typically
achieve 10- to 20-m RMS horizontal and vertical errors (Table 8.1; Muller and
Eales, 1990; Theodossiou and Dowman, 1990; Sasowsky et al., 1992). <p>
JERS-1 OPS data have also been used in an experimental manner to produce DEMs
(Shimada et al., 1992).  With its nadir and 15.33deg. forward-looking sensors,
OPS acquires near-simultaneous stereo coverage with a base-to-height ratio of
0.3.  Nominal pixel size of the images is 18 by 24 m.  Vertical error, with
GCP, was found to be 60-m RMS.  AVNIR, the proposed 1995 follow-on to OPS, will
have cross-track stereo capability only, looking from +/-40deg., for a
base-to-height ratio of 0.6.  Its nominal 8-m image pixel size may allow more
accurate DEMs to be produced, provided it has good satellite position and
attitude data, and GCPs are available. <p>
ASTER, an EOS instrument planned for 1998, would have both along-track and
cross-track modes with errors estimated from 15- to 20-m vertical and 8- to
15-m horizontal, using GCPs. <p>
Without GCP, these stereo-optical missions cannot achieve even the vertical
accuracies shown in <a href="Report27.gif">Fig. 8.1 </a> and Table 8.1.<b> </b> Further, truly global
coverage is unlikely, even with a space mission, because of orbital limitations
and the requirement for two cloud-free scenes with compatible imaging geometry.
For these reasons, stereo-optical data would likely be acquired in a piecemeal
fashion, slowly building up coverage from a variety of missions with different
orbits, tracking accuracies, illumination conditions, and correspondingly
different ground height accuracies.  <p>
Likewise, the existing inventory of topographic data has been produced from a
variety of data sets with a potpourri of horizontal and vertical datums,
accuracies, formats, map projections, and resolutions, making it nearly
impossible to produce a uniform data set or to assess the accuracy of the
resulting derived product.  From this discussion, it should be clear why 250-m
height errors still reside in existing digital data bases in supposedly
well-mapped areas of the U.S. (<a href="fig2.2.gif">Fig. 2.2</a>).  Space-based stereo-optical data
would likely suffer from the same lack of consistency when one attempts to
integrate it into a global data set.  <p>
	Perhaps the major constraint on any stereo-optical approach is the existence
of clouds in the Earth's atmosphere.  Several studies have been conducted in
the past two decades to determine the actual coverage that can be expected from
orbital photography, using data from Landsat, various manned orbital flights,
weather satellites, high-altitude aircraft, and ground observations (e.g.
Warren et al., 1986; Hahn et al., 1987; Minnis, 1989).  Using these data,
Harding et al. (1994) derived the climatological probability for a nadir
cloud-free line of sight as a function of latitude (<a href="Report30.gif">
Fig. 8.3</a>).  This figure
implies that a long period of time would be required to obtain two optical
images of some areas of the Earth, particularly if the images were acquired at
separate times, as in the case of SPOT and other cross-track stereo imagers. <p>
Laser altimetry can provide high-resolution surface-elevation measurements and
detection of elevation change through time along profiles or narrow swaths.
Range to the surface is estimated by precise measurement of the round-trip
travel time of short-duration pulses of laser radiation (Krabil et al., 1984;
Bufton, 1989; Bufton et al., 1991).  Geolocated surface elevations are obtained
by combining the range data with platform position and pointing knowledge.  In
current aircraft implementations, position knowledge from kinematic GPS
trajectory solutions and pointing knowledge from inertial navigation
instrumentation yield elevation accuracies of  ~10 cm for surfaces  of  low
slope  and meter-level  results  for  steeply 
sloped surfaces.  From orbital platforms, arc-second-level pointing knowledge
from current-generation star cameras combined with GPS tracking should yield
similar elevation accuracies.<p>

<p>
<a href="Report30.gif">Fig. 8.3</a>.  The annual climatological probability of a nadir cloud-free line of
sight (CPncflos) for laser altimetry or stereo-optical imaging depends on
latitude and season.  This plot shows the probability averaged over one year.<p>
<p><hr>
<p>
Laser altimetry has the unique capability of measuring the vertical
distribution of surfaces within a single ground-resolution element (i.e., laser
footprint).  This result is achieved by digitizing the complex, time-varying
return pulse energy (waveform) that comes from the reflection of a single laser
pulse from multiple targets at varying heights within the footprint.  This
waveform is a measure of the vertical distribution of vegetation canopy
components (foliage, stems, branches), if present, and ground slope and
roughness, weighted by projected area, reflectivity, and the spatial
distribution of laser energy across the footprint.  Example applications
include measurement of Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheet elevations (Thomas et
al., 1992; Blankenship et al., 1993), outlet glacier strains and shape changes
due to surge events (Garvin and Williams, 1993; Garvin et al., in revision),
and the structural properties of vegetation canopy, such as tree height and
biomass (Aldred and Bonnor, 1985; Nelson et al., 1988 a,b).<p>
SAR interferometery is the most promising approach for acquiring global,
high-resolu-tion elevation data.  By providing its own illumination at a
wavelength long enough to penetrate clouds and rain, a SAR interferometer could
provide a global, uniformly high-quality topo-graphic data set.  A space-based
SAR, supplemented by a laser altimeter, could meet virtually every scientific
requirement identified to date for high-resolution digital topographic data. <p>
Several spaceborne radars have provided interferometric data over the last few
years, providing some useful data for assessment purposes.  These have all
employed the repeat-pass technique since they were all single platforms. The
most useful interferometer so far has been the European Space Agency's ERS-1
satellite, which produced thousands of radar images for a variety of
applications.  Interferometry was in its infancy when ERS-1 was designed, so
there are shortcomings in its use for DEM generation and change detection.  The
primary short-coming is orbit control.  A study by Solaas (1994) has determined
that only about 13% of ERS-1 repeated orbits are suitable for generation of a
DEM.  Although ERS-1 has been joined by ERS-2, there are no plans yet in place
to optimize either satellite for interferometry. <p>
JERS-1, a Japanese SAR, operates at a longer wavelength than ERS-1, so the
orbit control requirement is not as stringent.  However, it was not designed
for interferometry either, so very few scenes have been processed so far. <p>
In October 1994, the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C / X-Band Synthetic Aperture
Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) instrument flew a second time on Shuttle Endeavour.  As
part of the observa-tions, passes were planned to repeat the earlier April
orbits at the beginning and end of the mission.  Preliminary results indicate
that orbit control was excellent and many SAR interfero-metry images were
collected, containing the first multiwavelength (X, C, L) repeat-pass data and
allowing a comparison of wavelength effects in DEM generation and change
detection. <p>
The Canadian Space Agency plans to launch Radarsat in 1995. Once again, it was
not designed with interferometry in mind, so it is unknown how well its orbit
will be controlled. As with ERS-1, its relatively short wavelength will make
interferometry possible, but challenging. <p>
All of these repeat-pass demonstrations suffer from temporal decorrelation,
which limits their use to short repeat intervals or desert areas.  As this is
also a major problem for the generation of a global DEM from SAR
interferometry, it led to the development of the TOPSAT design (Zebker et al.,
1994; Farr et al., 1995).  NASA has been studying a global topography mission
for several years, and the current design of TOPSAT is also ideal for change
detection.  TOPSAT is a dual-spacecraft system, each equipped with an L-band
(24-cm wavelength) SAR, a multibeam laser altimeter, and a GPS receiver for
high-accuracy orbital tracking.  The two spacecraft will orbit about 1 km apart
to form the interferometer baseline, acquiring   high-resolution,
high-accuracy   topographic   data   over  the  entire  globe  within<p>
3 months.  With a total life span of 3 years, there will be ample opportunuty
to detect and quantify subtle surface changes.  The topographic data will be
nearly global in extent, and have high horizontal resolution (30 m) and
vertical accuracy (3 m or better).  The laser altimeter will make elevation
measurements of very high vertical accuracy (&lt; 1 m in low-relief terrain),
as well as vegetation height and surface roughness measurements in selected
areas.  The GPS receivers will be used for accurate (~10 cm) spacecraft
tracking to ensure that the data are acquired in a consistent
Earth-center-of-mass reference frame. <p>
The TOPSAT project has performed detailed studies of the twin-spacecraft
approach (<a href="fig8.4.gif">Fig. 8.4</a>; Table 8.2, 8.3).  The orbit studied to date allows access
nearly to the poles, but since the baseline distance between the two spacecraft
changes as a function of latitude, it limits operation of the SAR
interferometer to between 70deg. N and 70deg. S latitude.  This limitation is
because the baseline, which is at its maximum of 2 km at the equator, decreases
to the minimum usable (about 700 m) at those latitudes (Vincent, 1993).  Above
those latitudes, the laser altimeter will play a primary role.  In an extended
mission, however, the baseline could be increased to allow interferometric data
to be acquired up to 82deg. N and S.  The laser altimeter would obtain accurate
elevation data essentially to the poles, filling in the gap left by the SAR.
<p>
The laser altimeter on TOPSAT is a multibeam design with a distributed array of
five lasers, providing continuous measurements in a narrow swath directly
beneath the spacecraft.  Vertical accuracy will be ~20 cm over low-slope
regions, including the polar regions where the near-polar orbit of TOPSAT
allows dense spatial sampling, decreasing to several meters in high-relief
terrain.  The operating wavelength of the laser is 1.06 um.  The laser pulse
trans-mitter uses efficient solid-state sources with demonstrated lifetimes
adequate for a several-year mission.  Optical backscatter from the Earth's
surface is collected by a telescope and a detector array.  On-board
digitization of the return waveform at the nanosecond level permits assess-ment
of subpixel surface roughness and vegetation height (Harding et al., 1994b;
Blair et al., 1994) (<a href="fig5.1a.gif">Fig. 5.1a</a>,
<a href="Report23.gif">Fig. 5.1b</a>, and <a href="Report24.gif">Fig. 5.1c</a>).  Each laser beam is approximately 30 m in
diameter, and total swath width is 150 m per spacecraft.  Because the two
spacecraft have ground tracks that are separated by      2 km at the equator to
0 near the poles, the two swaths will generally be separated by a small amount.
In addition, subsequent passes of the pair of spacecraft are currently planned
to be about 30 km apart at the equator, again decreasing to 0 near the poles.
Poleward of 70deg. latitude, because the laser altimeter swaths converge, the
coverage increases to more than 15%. <p>

<p>
<b>Technical Challenges</b><p>
<b></b>Current problems in the derivation of DEMs from SAR interferometry
include the effects of steep slopes and vegetation cover.  Slopes that are
steeper than the radar look angle will "layover," a condition in which the top
of the slope is imaged over the lower slope, causing loss of information in
that area.  In addition, steep slopes facing away from the radar will either
have a lower SNR, causing large errors in phase-difference determination, or
will be in shadow, causing loss of data.  These problems have analogs in the
stereo-optical domain in shadows and distortions away from the principal point,
but are exacerbated by the relatively larger look angles (about 30deg. for
TOPSAT) in radar systems.<p>
Another problem shared by SAR and optical techniques is the measurement of
topography in vegetated regions.  Both techniques sense the top of dense
canopies, while most users want to learn the height of the underlying ground
surface.  As will be discussed below, the multibeam laser altimeter (MBLA) may
be used for corrections in selected areas. <p>
For any surface elevation measurement from space, the largest source of
systematic error is due to uncertainty in platform position and orientation.
The laser and radar systems measure in different look directions.  Because the
effect of orientation errors depends in part on look direction, and because
many points on the Earth's surface will be measured at least once by each
system, the systematic errors in the two measurements will be largely
independent.  In effect, each system can provide tie points to help understand
and remove the effect of attitude errors in the other system.  (Note that the
conservative performance estimates in Table 8.2<b> </b>have not assumed this
synergism nor any resulting reduction in systematic error due to platform
orientation.)  Table 8.3 summarizes the accuracy requirements for platform
position and orientation for a typical mission in terms of both control and
knowledge for the L-band system, such that 3-m vertical accuracy in the height
estimate is obtained on a 10deg. slope.<p>
Once the TOPSAT mission has mapped the Earth at least once (~3 months), the
spacecraft enters the change-detection phase of its mission.  Change detection
critically depends upon the extent of temporal decorrelation.  Limited data are
available to assess the statistics of temporal decorrelation.  Zebker and
Villasenor (1992) found that the floor of Death Valley was very stable at
L-band over 18 days, while a forested area in Oregon dropped to 60% correlation
over a similar time period.  Massonnet et al. (1994) found that, even at
C-band, the Mojave Desert decorrelated very little over a 14-month period.
Permafrost areas have been noted to lose and then regain correlation as they go
through cycles of freezing and thawing (Zebker et al., 1994b). It therefore
appears that forested areas and areas subject to freezing soils may retain
correlation for up to one month and that desert areas may retain correlation
for change detection for 1 or more years.  This limitation is shown in <a
href="Report29.gif">Fig.
8.2</a>, along with the requirements of the various groups that contributed to this
report.  Additional work needs to be done to better characterize the
environmental limits on temporal decorrelation, in order to make better
decisions on its use in any but an exploratory mode.  <p>
<b>Technology Group Recommendations:</b><p>
(1)	Continue design studies on a topographic mission optimized to include a
surface change-detection capability in addition to obtaining a global
high-resolution topographic map.  Long-wavelength SAR interferometry is the
best approach.  A multibeam laser altimeter provides synergistic informa-tion;
including this instrument in the mission should be investigated.<p>
(2)	Further near-term studies are required to quantify the effects of temporal
decorrelation in repeat-pass interferometry studies, particularly for urban
areas and areas covered by vegetation, snow, and ice. <p>
(3)	Research is needed on ways to achieve a 10-m horizontal resolution DEM with
1-m vertical accuracy at reasonable cost.<p>
(4)	Research is needed on ways to extend mission life time economically to
maximize the opportunity for change studies.<p>
(5)	Beam steering and orbit flexibility need to be investigated as ways of
monitoring targets of opportunity from space.<p>
(6)	Orbit-change options need to be reviewed to optimize sampling strategy and
target flexibility while retaining global coverage.<p>

<title>SUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS - SAR Interferometry and Surface Change
Detection</title></head><body><b></b><p>
<h1>IX. SUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS</h1>
<h2>SAR Interferometry and Surface Change Detection</h2>
<hr>
<p>
There was general agreement in the workshop that SAR interferometry
holds great promise as a change-detection tool in the fields of earthquake
studies, volcano monitoring, and glacier and ice-stream flow studies.  In a
number of other fields, such as hydrology, geomor-phology, and ecosystem
studies, generating an accurate, globally consistent DEM with SAR
interferometry would be a major advance by itself.  <p>
The following recommendations are common to most of the groups, and are
summa-rized from the preceding chapters:<p>
(1)	Pursue research aimed at better characterizing and understanding temporal
decorrelation in a variety of environments.<p>
(2)	Pursue the use of an aircraft platform for change detection, to supplement
existing spaceborne techniques and provide more coverage prior to a dedicated
mission.<p>
(3)	Pursue declassification of existing topographic data to provide good
worldwide coverage, and enhance the feasibility of change detection with
two-pass SAR interferometry.  In particular, NASA should continue its efforts
to promote the release of DMA  DTED data.<p>
(4)	Expand the capabilities for SAR processing, by preparing a portable version
of the software to enable university and other investigators to exploit SAR
interferometry.<p>
(5)	Add a ground receiving station for SAR data in Hawaii to enable
interfero-metric monitoring of the inflation/deflation of Mauna Loa and Kilauea
and the deformation associated with a large potential landslide on the flank of
Kilauea and to study temporal decorrelation in a wide variety of environments
within a single area.  Explore the establishment of similar stations in other
regions of the globe to facilitate regional studies with existing space
systems. <p>
(6)	Pursue engineering studies to assess the feasibility and cost of obtaining
a global topographic data set with 10-m spatial resolution.<p>
(7)	Establish an advisory group of scientists, engineers, and operations
managers to guide future efforts and assess accomplishments related to the
research goals listed above and the mission goals listed below. <p>
(8)	Pursue a dedicated space mission aimed at long-term monitoring of active
earthquake zones, volcanoes, and other surface change phenomena, such as
glaciers and ice sheets, and acquisition of a global DEM.  Surface change
should be measurable to 1 cm or better, and the DEM should have horizontal
resolution of 30 m or better and vertical accuracy of 3 m or better.  To
optimize the mission for interferometric change detection, it should include a
longer wavelength radar, e.g., L-band (24-cm wave-length), and have wide swath
width (100 km or more), long duration (3 years or more), dual antennas (for
same-pass acquisition of high-resolu-tion high-accuracy topographic data), and
possibly include multiple spacecraft (to enhance spatial coverage with rapid
revisit times).  At least one phase of the mission should include full polar
coverage.<p>
<p>
<i>A twin spacecraft L-band system, such as NASA's proposed TOPSAT mission, can
meet these requirements.  This mission should be launched as soon as
possible.</i><p>

<H1>Jerusalem and the Dead Sea</H1> 
<P>
This space radar image shows the area surrounding the Dead Sea 
along the West Bank between Israel and Jordan.  This region is of 
major cultural and historical importance to millions of  Muslims, 
Jews and Christians who consider it the Holy Land. The yellow 
area at the top of the image is the city of  Jericho.  A portion 
of the Dead Sea is shown as the large black area at the top right 
side of the image. The Jordan River is the white line at the top 
of the image which flows into the Dead Sea. Jerusalem, which lies 
in the Judaean Hill Country, is the bright, yellowish area shown 
along the left center of the image.  Just below and to the right 
of Jerusalem is the town of Bethlehem.  The city of Hebron is the 
white, yellowish area near the bottom of the image. The area 
around Jerusalem has a history of more than 2,000 years of 
settlement and scientists are hoping to use these data to unveil 
more about this region's past.  The Jordan River Valley is part 
of an active fault and rift system that extends from southern 
Turkey and connects with the east African rift zone. This fault 
system has produced major earthquakes throughout history and some 
scientists theorize that an earthquake may have caused the fall 
of Jericho's walls. The Dead Sea basin is formed by active 
earthquake faulting and contains the lowest place on the Earth's 
surface at about 400 meters (1,300 feet) below sea level.  It was 
in caves along the northern shore of the Dead Sea that the Dead 
Sea Scrolls were found in 1947.  The blue and green areas are 
generally regions of undeveloped hills and the dark green areas 
are the smooth lowlands of the Jordan River Valley.  This image 
is 73 kilometers by 45 kilometers (45 miles by 28 miles) and is 
centered at 31.7 degrees north latitude, 35.4 degrees east 
longitude.  North is toward the upper left. The colors are 
assigned to different radar frequencies and polarizations as 
follows: red is L-band, horizontally transmitted and vertically 
received; green is L-band, horizontally transmitted and 
horizontally received; and blue is C-band, horizontally 
transmitted and vertically received. The image was acquired by 
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar 
(SIR-C/X-SAR) on October 3, 1994 onboard the space shuttle 
Endeavour. SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the German, Italian 
and United States space agencies, is part of NASA's Mission to 
Planet Earth.  Each flight of SIR-C/X-SAR collected data at more 
than 400 sites around the globe.  The science team is using 
images like this one to help answer various scientific questions 
about the condition of ecosystems, the extent of snow and ice 
packs, geologic activity such as volcanoes and earthquakes, and 
measurement of ocean waves and currents.

Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) 
is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. The radars illuminate Earth with 
microwaves allowing detailed observations at any time, regardless of weather 
or sunlight conditions. SIR-C/X-SAR uses three microwave wavelengths:  L-band 
(24 cm), C-band (6 cm) and X-band (3 cm).  The multi-frequency data will be 
used by the international scientific community to better understand the global 
environment and how it is changing. The SIR-C/X-SAR data, complemented by 
aircraft and ground studies, will give scientists clearer insights into those 
environmental changes which are caused by nature and those changes which are 
induced by human activity.  SIR-C was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory. X-SAR was developed by the Dornier and Alenia Spazio companies for 
the German space agency, Deutsche Agentur fuer Raumfahrtangelegenheiten 
(DARA), and the Italian space agency, Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI), with 
the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt fuer Luft und Raumfahrt e.v.(DLR), the major 
partner in science, operations, and data processing of X-SAR.

<H1>Reunion Island</H1> 
<P>
This radar image shows the volcanic island of Reunion, about 700 
km (434 miles) east of Madagascar in the southwest Indian Ocean.  
The southern half of the island is dominated by the active 
volcano, Piton de la Fournaise.  This is one of the world's most 
active volcanoes, with more than 100 eruptions in the last 300 
years.  The most recent activity  occurred in the vicinity of  
Dolomieu Crater, shown in the lower center of the image within a 
horseshoe-shaped collapse zone.  Recent lava flows appear in 
shades of red, purple and orange.  Light green areas are heavily 
vegetated forest, while much of the purple area near the coast is 
farmland.  The radar illumination is from the left side of  the 
image and dramatically emphasizes the precipitous cliffs at the 
edges of  the central canyons of the island.  These canyons are 
remnants from the collapse of formerly active parts of the 
volcanoes that built the island. This image was acquired by the 
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X- Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-
C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on October 5, 1994.  
The image is centered at 21.2 degrees south latitude, 55.6 
degrees east longitude.  The area shown is approximately 50 km by 
80 km (31 miles by 50 miles).  North is toward the upper right.  
Colors are assigned to different frequencies and polarizations of 
the radar as follows:  red  is L-band horizontally transmitted, 
vertically received; green is L-band horizontally transmitted, 
vertically received; and blue is  C-band horizontally 
transmitted, vertically received. SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of 
the German, Italian and United States space agencies, is part of 
NASA's Mission to Planet Earth.

<H1>Boston, Massachusetts</H1> 
<P> 
This radar image of the area surrounding Boston, Mass., shows how a spaceborne 
radar system distinguishes between densely populated urban areas and nearby 
areas that are relatively unsettled. The bright white area at the right center 
of the image is downtown Boston. The wide river below and to the left of the 
city is the Charles River in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood.  The dark green 
patch to the right of the Back Bay is Boston Common.  A bridge across the 
north end of Back Bay connects the cities of  Boston and Cambridge.  The light 
green areas that dominate most of the image are the suburban communities 
surrounding Boston.  The many ponds that dot the region appear as dark 
irregular spots.  Many densely populated urban areas show up as red in the 
image due to the alignment of streets and buildings to the incoming radar 
beam. North is toward the upper left. The image was acquired on October 9, 
1994, by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-
C/X-SAR) as it flew aboard the space shuttle Endeavour. This area is centered 
at 42.4 degrees north latitude, 71.2 degrees west longitude.  The area shown 
is approximately 37 km by 18 km (23 miles by 11 miles).  Colors are assigned 
to different  radar frequencies and polarizations as follows: red is L-band 
horizontally transmitted, horizontally received; green is L-band horizontally 
transmitted, vertically received; blue is C-band horizontally transmitted, 
vertically received. SIR-C/X-SAR, a cooperative mission of the German, Italian

<H1>Owens Valley, California</H1>   
<P> 
This is a three-dimensional perspective view of Owens  
Valley, near the town of Bishop, California that was created  
by combining two spaceborne radar images using a technique  
known as interferometry. Visualizations like this one are  
helpful to scientists because they clarify the relationships  
of the different types of surfaces detected by the radar and  
the shapes of the topographic features such as mountains and  
valleys.  The view is looking southeast along the eastern  
edge of  Owens Valley.  The White Mountains are in the  
center of the image, and the Inyo Mountains loom in the  
background.  The high peaks of the White Mountains rise more  
than 3,000 meters (10,000 feet) above the valley floor.  The  
runways of the Bishop airport are visible at the right edge  
of the image. The meandering course of the Owens River and  
its tributaries appear light blue on the valley floor. Blue  
areas in the image are smooth, yellow areas are rock  
outcrops, and brown areas near the mountains are deposits of  
boulders, gravel and sand known as alluvial fans.  The image  
was constructed by overlaying a color composite  radar image  
on top of  a digital elevation map. The radar data were  
taken by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic  
Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) on board the space shuttle  
Endeavour in October 1994.  The digital elevation map was  
produced using radar interferometry, a process in which  
radar data are acquired on different passes of the space  
shuttle.  The two data passes are compared to obtain  
elevation information. The elevation data were derived from  
a 1,500-km-long (930-mile) digital topographic map processed  
at JPL. Radar image data are draped over the topography to  
provide the color with the following assignments: red is L- 
band vertically transmitted, vertically received; green is  
C-band vertically transmitted, vetically received; and blue  
is the ratio of C-band vertically transmitted, vertically  
received to L-band vertically transmitted, vertically  
received. This image is centered near 37.4 degrees north  
latitude and 118.3 degrees west longitude.  No vertical  
exaggeration factor has been applied to the data.  SIR-C/X- 
SAR, a joint mission of the German, Italian, and the United  
States space agencies, is part of NASA's Mission to Planet  
Earth.

<H1>Saline Valley, Calif.</H1>  
<P>
This is a three-dimensional perspective view of Saline  
Valley, about 30 km (19 miles) east of the town of   
Independence, California created by combining two spaceborne  
radar images using a technique known as interferometry.  
Visualizations like this one are helpful to scientists  
because they clarify the relationships of the different  
types of surfaces detected by the radar and the shapes of  
the topographic features such as mountains and valleys.  The  
view is looking southwest across Saline Valley.  The high  
peaks in the background are the Inyo Mountains, which rise  
more than  3,000 meters (10,000 feet) above the valley  
floor.  The dark blue patch near the center of the image is  
an area of sand dunes.  The brighter patches to the left of  
the dunes are the dry, salty lake beds of Saline Valley.   
The brown and orange areas are deposits of  boulders, gravel  
and sand known as alluvial fans.  The image was constructed  
by overlaying a color composite radar image on top of a  
digital elevation map.   The radar image was taken by the  
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar  
(SIR-C/X-SAR) on board the space shuttle Endeavour in  
October 1994.  The digital elevation map was produced using  
radar interferometry, a process in which radar data are  
acquired on different passes of the space shuttle.  The two  
data passes are compared to obtain elevation information..   
The elevation data were derived from a 1,500-km-long (930- 
mile) digital topographic map processed at JPL. Radar image  
data are draped over the topography to provide the color  
with the following assignments:  red is L-band vertically  
transmitted, vertically received; green is C-band vertically  
transmitted, vetically received; and blue is the ratio of C- 
band vertically transmitted, vertically received to L-band  
vertically transmitted, vertically received. This image is  
centered near 36.8 degrees north latitude and 117.7 degrees  
west longitude.  No vertical exaggeration factor has been  
applied to the data.  SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the  
German, Italian, and the United States space agencies, is  
part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth.

<H1>Karakax Valley, China 3-D View</H1>
<P>This three-dimensional perspective of the remote Karakax
Valley in the northern Tibetan Plateau of western China was 
created by combining two spaceborne radar images using a 
technique known as interferometry. Visualizations like this are 
helpful to scientists because they reveal where the slopes of the 
valley are cut by erosion, as well as the accumulations of gravel 
deposits at the base of the mountains.  These gravel deposits, 
called alluvial fans, are a common landform in desert regions 
that scientists are mapping in order to learn more about Earth's 
past climate changes. Higher up the valley side is a clear break 
in the slope, running straight, just below the ridge line.  This 
is the trace of the Altyn Tagh fault, which is much longer than 
California's San Andreas fault.  Geophysicists are studying this 
fault for clues it may be able to give them about large faults. 
Elevations range from 4000 m (13,100 ft) in the valley to over 
6000 m (19,700 ft) at the peaks of the glaciated Kun Lun 
mountains running from the front right towards the back. Scale 
varies in this perspective view, but the area is about 20 km (12 
miles) wide in the middle of the image, and there is no vertical 
exaggeration.  The two radar images were acquired on separate 
days during the second flight of the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-
C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space 
shuttle Endeavour in October 1994.  The interferometry technique 
provides elevation measurements of all points in the scene.  The 
resulting digital topographic map was used to create this view, 
looking northwest from high over the valley. Variations in the 
colors can be related to gravel, sand and rock outcrops. This 
image is centered at 36.1 degrees north latitude, 79.2 degrees 
east longitude. Radar image data are draped over the topography 
to provide the color with the following assignments:  Red is L-
band vertically transmitted, vertically received; green is the 
average of L-band vertically transmitted, vertically received and 
C-band vertically transmitted, vertically received; and blue is 
C-band vertically transmitted, vertically received.  SIR-C/X-SAR, 
a joint mission of the German, Italian and United States space 
agencies, is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth.

<H1>Oil Slicks</H1> 
<P>
This is a radar image of an offshore drilling field about 150 km 
(93 miles) west of  Bombay, India, in the Arabian Sea.  The dark 
streaks are extensive oil slicks surrounding many of the drilling 
platforms, which appear as bright white spots.  Radar images are 
useful for detecting and measuring the extent of oil seepages on 
the ocean surface, from both natural and industrial sources. The 
long, thin streaks extending from many of the platforms are 
spreading across the sea surface, pushed by local winds. The 
larger dark patches are dispersed slicks that were likely 
discharged earlier than the longer streaks, when the winds were 
probably from a different direction. The dispersed oil will 
eventually spread out over the more dense water and become a 
layer which is a single molecule thick. Many forms of oil, both 
from biological and from petroleum sources, smooth out the ocean 
surface, causing the area to appear dark in radar images.  There 
are also two forms of ocean waves shown in this image.  The 
dominant group of large waves (upper center) are called internal 
waves. These waves are formed below the ocean surface at the 
boundary between layers of warm and cold water and they appear in 
the radar image because of the way they change the ocean surface. 
Ocean swells, which are waves generated by winds, are shown 
throughout the image but are most distinct in the blue area 
adjacent to the internal waves.  Identification of waves provide 
oceanographers with information about the smaller scale dynamic 
processes of the ocean.  This image was acquired by the 
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-
C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on October 9, 1994. 
The colors are assigned to different frequencies and 
polarizations of the radar as follows:  Red is L-band vertically 
transmitted, vertically received; green is the average of  L-band 
vertically transmitted, vertically received and C-band vertically 
transmitted, vertically received; blue is C-band vertically 
transmitted, vertically received. The image is located at 19.25 
degrees north latitude and 71.34 degrees east longitude and 
covers an area 20 km by 45 km (12.4 miles by 27.9 miles). SIR-
C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the German, Italian and United States 
space agencies, is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth.

<H1>Weddell Sea/ScanSAR</H1> 
<P>
Two radar images are shown in this composite to compare the size of a 
standard spaceborne radar image (small inset) to the image that is 
created when the radar instrument is used in the ScanSAR mode (large 
image).  The predominant image shows two large ocean circulation 
features, called eddies, at the northernmost edge of the sea ice pack 
in the Weddell Sea, off Antarctica. The eddy processes in this region 
play an important role in the circulation of the global ocean and the 
transportation of heat toward the pole. The large image is the first 
wide-swath, multi-frequency, multi-polarization radar image ever 
processed. To date, no other spaceborne radar sensors have obtained 
swaths exceeding 100 kilometers (62 miles) in width. This 
developmental image was produced at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
by the Alaska SAR Facility's ScanSAR processor system, using radar 
data obtained on October 5, 1994, during the second flight of the 
Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-
SAR) onboard the space shuttle Endeavour.  The image is oriented 
approximately east-west, with a center location of around 56.6 
degrees south latitude and 6.5 degrees west longitude. Image 
dimensions are 240 km by 350 km (149 miles by 218 miles). The smaller 
image inset (upper right edge) was obtained by SIR-C/X-SAR on October 
6, 1994, and covers a portion of  the same ice features that are 
shown in the large image.  The inset image dimensions are 18 km by 50 
km (11 miles by 31 miles). The ocean eddies have a clockwise (or 
cyclonic) rotation and are roughly 40 km to 60 km (25 miles to 37 
miles) in diameter.  The dark areas are new ice and the lighter green 
areas are small sea-ice floes that are swept along by surface 
currents; both of these areas are shown within the eddies and to the 
south of the eddies.  First year seasonal ice, typically 0.5 meter to 
0.8 meter (1.5 feet to 2.5 feet) thick, is shown in the darker green 
area in the lower right corner.  The open ocean to the north is 
uniformly bright and appears blue, due to high winds making the 
surface rough. The colors in both images were obtained using the 
following radar channels: red is C-band vertically transmitted and 
vertically received; green is L-band horizontally transmitted and 
vertically received; and blue is L-band vertically transmitted and 
vertically received.  The ScanSAR processor is being designed for 
implementation in 1996 at NASA's Alaska SAR Facility, located at the 
University of Alaska, Fairbanks, and will produce digital images from 
the forthcoming Canadian RADARSAT satellite, since its C-band 
horizontally transmitted, horizontally received polarization radar 
routinely obtains data over a considerable range of swath-widths and 
resolutions, including the important wide-swath (300 km to 500 km/186 
miles to 310 miles) mode.

<H1>Central Sumatra, Indonesia</H1> 
<P>
This is a radar image of the central part of the island of 
Sumatra in Indonesia that shows how the tropical rainforest 
typical of this country is being impacted by human activity. 
Native forest appears in green in this image, while prominent 
pink areas represent places where the native forest has been 
cleared. The large rectangular areas have been cleared for palm 
oil plantations.  The bright pink zones are areas that have been 
cleared since 1989, while the dark pink zones are areas that were 
cleared before 1989. These radar data were processed as part of 
an effort to assist oil and gas companies working in the area to 
assess the environmental impact of  both their drilling 
operations and the activities of the local population.  Radar 
images are useful in these areas because heavy cloud cover and 
the persistent smoke and haze associated with deforestation have 
prevented usable visible-light imagery from being acquired since 
1989.  The dark shapes in the upper right (northeast) corner of 
the image are a chain of lakes in flat coastal marshes. This 
image was acquired in October 1994 by the Spaceborne Imaging 
Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard the 
space shuttle Endeavour.  Environmental changes can be easily 
documented by comparing this image with visible-light data that 
were acquired in previous years by the Landsat satellite. The 
image is centered at 0.9 degrees north latitude and 101.3 degrees 
east longitude.  The area shown is 50 kilometers by 100 
kilometers (31 miles by 62 miles). The colors in the image are 
assigned to different frequencies and polarizations of the radar 
as follows: red is L-band horizontally transmitted, horizontally

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Sakura-jima Volcano, Japan</TITLE>
<H1>Sakura-jima Volcano, Japan
</H1> 
<P> 
The active volcano Sakura-jima on the island of Kyushu, Japan is shown
in the center of this radar
image. The volcano occupies the peninsula in the center of Kagoshima
Bay, which was formed by the
explosion and collapse of an ancient predecessor of today's volcano. The
volcano has been in near
continuous eruption since 1955. Its explosions of ash and gas are
closely monitored by local
authorities due to the proximity of the city of Kagoshima across a
narrow strait from the volcano's
center, shown below and to the left of the central peninsula in this
image. City residents have grown
accustomed to clearing ash deposits from sidewalks, cars and buildings
following Sakura-jima's
eruptions. The volcano is one of 15 identified by scientists as
potentially hazardous to local
populations, as part of the international "Decade Volcano" program. The
image was acquired by the
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR)
onboard the space

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Teide Volcano</TITLE>
<H1>Teide Volcano</H1> 
<P> 
This radar image shows the Teide volcano on the island of Tenerife in
the Canary Islands. The Canary
Islands, part of Spain, are located in the eastern Atlantic Ocean off
the coast of Morocco. Teide has
erupted only once in the 20th Century, in 1909, but is considered a
potentially threatening volcano
due to its proximity to the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, shown in
this image as the purple and white
area on the lower right edge of the island. The summit crater of Teide,
clearly visible in the left
center of the image, contains lava flows of various ages and roughnesses
that appear in shades of
green and brown. Different vegetation zones, both natural and
agricultural, are detected by the radar
as areas of purple, green and yellow on the volcano's flanks. Scientists
are using images such as this to
understand the evolution of the structure of Teide, especially the
formation of the summit caldera and
the potential for collapse of the flanks. The volcano is one of 15
identified by scientists as potentially
hazardous to local populations, as part of the international "Decade
Volcano" program. The image
was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture
Radar
(SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard the space shuttle Endeavour on October 11, 1994.
SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint
mission of the German, Italian and the United States space agencies, is
part of NASA's Mission to
Planet Earth. The image is centered at 28.3 degrees North latitude and
16.6 degrees West longitude.
North is toward the upper right. The area shown measures 90 kilometers
by 54.5 kilometers (55.8
miles by 33.8 miles). The colors in the image are assigned to different
frequencies and polarizations
of the radar as follows: red is L-band horizontally transmitted,
horizontally received; green is
L-band horizontally transmitted, vertically received; blue is C-band
horizontally transmitted,
vertically received.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Harvard forest</TITLE>
<H1>Harvard forest
</H1> 
<P> 
This is a radar image of the area surrounding the Harvard Forest in
north-central Massachusetts that
has been operated as a ecological research facility by Harvard
University since 1907. At the center of
the image is the Quabbin Reservoir, and the Connecticut River is at the
lower left of the image. The
Harvard Forest itself is just above the reservoir. Researchers are
comparing the naturally occurring
physical disturbances in the forest and the recent and projected
chemical disturbances and their effects
on the forest ecosystem. Agricultural land appears dark blue/purple,
along with low shrub vegetation
and some wetlands. Urban development is bright pink; the yellow to green
tints are
conifer-dominated vegetation with the pitch pine sand plain at the
middle left edge of the image
appearing very distinctive. The green tint may indicate pure pine
plantation stands, and deciduous
broadleaf trees appear gray/pink with perhaps wetter sites being pinker.
This image was acquired on September 30, 1994 by
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the
space shuttle Endeavour. SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the German,
Italian and the United States
space agencies, is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. The image is
centered at 42.50 degrees
North latitude and 72.33 degrees West longitude and covers an area of 53
kilometers 63 by kilometers
(33 miles by 39 miles). The colors in the image are assigned to
different frequencies and polarizations
of the radar as follows: red is L-band horizontally transmitted and
horizontally received; green is
L-band horizontally transmitted and vertically received; and blue is
C-band horizontally transmitted
and horizontally received.

<TITLE>SRL-2 San Francisco</TITLE>
<H1>SIR-C image of San Francisco, California</H1> 
<P> 
This image of San Francisco, California shows how the radar distingishes
between
densely populated urban areas and nearby areas that are relatively
unsettled.
Downtown San Francisco is at the center and the city of Oakland is at the
right
across the San
Francisco Bay. Some city areas, such as the South of Market, called the SOMA
district in San Francisco, appear bright red due to the alignment of streets
and
buildings to the incoming radar beam.  Various bridges in the area are also
visible including the Golden Gate Bridge (left center) at the opening of
San
Francisco Bay, the Bay Bridge (right center) connecting San Francisco and
Oakland, and the San Mateo Bridge (bottom center).  All the dark areas on
the
image are relatively smooth water: the Pacific Ocean to the left, San
Francisco
Bay in the center, and various reservoirs.  Two major faults bounding the
San
Francisco-Oakland urban areas are visible on this image.  The
San Andreas fault, on the San Francisco peninsula, is seen in the lower left
of
the image.  The fault trace is the straight feature filled with linear
reservoirs which appear dark.  The Hayward fault is the straight feature on
the
right side of the image between the urban
areas and the hillier terrain to the east.  The image is about 42 kilometers
by
58 kilometers (26 miles by 36 miles) with north toward the upper right.
This
area is centered at 37.83 degrees north latitude, 122.38 degrees east
longitude.
<p>
The image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic
Aperture (SIR-C/X-SAR)
imaging radar when it flew aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on October 3,
1994. SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the German,  Italian and the United

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Central Java, Indonesia</TITLE>
<H1>Central Java, Indonesia
</H1> 
<P> 
The summits of two large volcanoes in Central Java, Indonesia are shown
in the center of this radar image. Lava flows of
different ages and surface roughness appear in shades of green and
yellow surrounding the summit of Mt. Merbabu (mid-center)
and Mt. Merapi (lower center). Mt. Merapi erupted on Novemeber 28, 1994
about six weeks after this image was taken. The
eruption killed more than 60 people and forced the evacuation of more
than 6,000 others. Thousands of other residents were put
on alert due to the possibility of volcanic debris mudflows, called
lahars, that threatened nearby towns. Mt. Merapi is located
approximately 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Yogyakarta, the capital
of Central Java. The older volcano at the top of the
image is unnamed. Lake Rawapening is the dark blue feature in the upper
right. The light blue area southeast of the lake is the
city of Salatiga. Directly south of Salatiga and southeast of Mt. Merapi
is the city of Boyolali. Scientists are studying Mt.
Merapi as part of the international "Decade Volcanoes" project, because
of its recent activity and potential threat to local
populations. The radar data are being used to identify and distinguish a
variety of volcanic features. This image was acquired on
October 10, 1994 by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space
shuttle Endeavour.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - West Texas scanSAR</TITLE>
<H1>West Texas scanSAR
</H1> 
<P> 
his radar image of the Midland/Odessa region of West Texas, demonstrates
an experimental technique, called ScanSAR, that allows scientists to
rapidly image
large areas of the Earth's surface. The large image covers an area 245
kilometers by 225 kilometers (152 miles by 139 miles). It was obtained
by the Spaceborne
Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR- C/X-SAR) flying
aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on October 5, 1994. The smaller inset
image is a
standard SIR-C image showing a portion of the same area, 100 kilometers
by 57 kilometers (62 miles by 35 miles) and was taken during the first
flight of SIR-C
on April 14, 1994. The bright spots on the right side of the image are
the cities of Odessa (left) and Midland (right), Texas. The Pecos River
runs from the top
center to the bottom center of the image. Along the left side of the
image are, from top to bottom, parts of the Guadalupe, Davis and
Santiago Mountains. North is
toward the upper right. Unlike conventional radar imaging, in which a
radar continuously illuminates a single ground swath as the space
shuttle passes over the
terrain, a Scansar radar illuminates several adjacent ground swaths
almost simultaneously, by "scanning" the radar beam across a large area
in a rapid sequence. The
adjacent swaths, typically about 50 km (31 miles) wide, are then merged
during ground processing to produce a single large scene. Illumination
for this L-band
scene is from the top of the image. The beams were scanned from the top
of the scene to the bottom, as the shuttle flew from left to right. This
scene was acquired
in about 30 seconds. A normal SIR- C image is acquired in about 13
seconds. The ScanSAR mode will likely be used on future radar sensors to
construct regional
and possibly global radar images and topographic maps. The ScanSAR
processor is being designed for 1996 implementation at NASA's Alaska SAR
Facility,
located at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and will produce digital
images from the forthcoming Canadian RADARSAT satellite.
