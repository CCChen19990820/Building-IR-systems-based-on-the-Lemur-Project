<A NAME="COAL">COAL</A>
</H4>
<P>
By the time white settlers arrived in Texas, indigenous tribes had been burning coal for many millennia. Between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago, tribal groups near Lake Lewisville were using lignite to heat their homes and cook their food. Archaeological sites in Bastrop County contain burned lignite dating back 5,000 years. Throughout the early 1800s settlers utilized coal they found on the surface and by 1850, small scale mining had begun. 
<P>
Today, Texas leads the nation in coal consumption by a large margin. In 1993, Texas used 96 million tons of coal. By comparison, Indiana, the number two coal-consuming state, used about 60 million tons of coal.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#53">(53)</A> Nearly 95 percent of the coal consumed in Texas was used to generate electricity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#54">(54)</A> 
<P>
Texas mines produce two-thirds of the coal consumed in the state. Some 56 million tons of lignite are mined in Texas annually. The sixth and twelfth largest coal mines in America are located in Texas. The Martin Lake and Monticello mines, both owned by Texas Utilities Mining Co., together produce nearly 25 million tons of lignite per year.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#55">(55)</A> 
<P>
Texas has more than 24 billion tons of lignite that can be recovered through conventional strip mining methods. At current rates of production, Texas' coal supply will last about 400 years.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#56">(56)</A> In addition, the state contains another 35 billion tons of coal in deep reserves. All told, the state's coal deposits contain the energy equivalent of more than 100 billion barrels of oil. 
<P>
Coal consumption in Texas is rising faster than any other form of energy. By 2030, the state's coal consumption is expected to be about 180 million tons per year, twice as much as the state consumed in 1990.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#57">(57)</A> However, the state's appetite for coal has caused serious pollution problems around the state. Five of the top ten sources of air pollution in the state are coal-fired electric power plants.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#58">(58)</A> Studies have linked elevated selenium levels in a number of East Texas Lakes with nearby coal-fired power plants.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#59">(59)</A> 
<P>
Burning coal also produces sulfur dioxide, an air pollutant that can cause acid rain. Acid rain poses a serious threat to East Texas lakes, which have little ability to counter acidic input.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#60">(60)</A> In addition to the air quality problems presented by coal consumption, strip mining presents a range of problems. Since 1982, more than 52,000 acres of land in the state has been strip mined for lignite.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#61">(61)</A> Adequate reclamation of strip mined property is expensive and time consuming. Often, sites are re-planted with just one type of plant material. Biologists point out that the resulting monoculture does not support a diversity of wildlife.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#62">(62)</A> In addition, the strip mined land can be subject to subsidence and erosion.

<A NAME="ELECTRICITY">ELECTRICITY</A>
</H4>
<P>
The Texas economy is changing. The service sector and light manufacturing companies are growing rapidly. The new, high-technology companies rely on computers and the microchip to speed information and products to consumers. But the emerging information economy depends on electric power. So do our air conditioners, answering machines, personal computers, microwave ovens, tape recorders and a panoply of other consumer products.
<P>
The burgeoning Texas economy and the state's rapidly growing population have caused a surge in demand for electricity. From 1970 to 1990, electricity consumption in Texas more than doubled.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#63">(63)</A> Without a change in the pattern of consumption or major conservation efforts, the demand for electricity in Texas will require utilities to build 90 new power plants over the next 15 years.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#64">(64)</A> These new plants could increase the state's electrical capacity by almost 25 percent.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#65">(65)</A> 
<P>
Texas produces and consumes more electricity than any other state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#66">(66)</A> In 1991, Texans paid $14 billion for electricity while consuming 241 million megawatt hours of electricity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#67">(67)</A> Twenty-seven electric utilities are currently operating 312 generating stations in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#68">(68)</A> These facilities have a combined net capacity of 60,687 megawatts. Of the 27 utilities, nine are investor-owned, five are electric cooperatives, five are federal or state agencies and eight are owned by municipalities. 
<P>
Much of the new demand for electric power is coming from the residential sector, where electricity consumption is growing rapidly. In 1970, electricity accounted for 32 percent of the energy needs in the average home. By 1990, electricity supplied 54 percent of residential energy needs. By the year 2000, that figure is expected to rise to 56 percent and by the year 2030, electricity may supply 61 percent of all home energy needs.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#69">(69)</A> 
<P>
In 1992, Texas residents paid about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#70">(70)</A> The Public Utilities Commission of Texas estimates that by the year 2000, consumers will be paying 10.4 cents per kilowatt hour.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#71">(71)</A> In addition to the rising cost of electricity, Texas is facing environmental problems caused by electricity production. Texas is the country's largest consumer of coal (more than 90 million tons per year), and the power plants that burn coal pump millions of tons of carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide (which can cause acid rain), nitrogen oxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere every year. (See Air Chapter for further discussion.)
<P>
In 1977, natural gas accounted for 86 percent of the fuel used to generate electric power in Texas. But in 1978, Congress passed the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act, which required utilities to phase out the use of natural gas as a boiler fuel by 1990. Designed as a response to perceived natural gas shortages, this requirement was later repealed when new gas supplies were discovered. However, by then, many Texas utility companies had begun developing coal supplies, which were viewed as a way to diversify their power-generation base. Today, about 40 percent of all the electricity consumed in Texas is derived from the burning of natural gas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#72">(72)</A> Half of the state's electricity is derived from burning coal. The balance comes from nuclear power, hydropower and renewables. 
<P>
In 1990, electric power generation in the state produced 66 percent of the total sulfur dioxides, 37 percent of total nitrogen oxides and 35 percent of all the carbon dioxide emitted into the air in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#73">(73)</A> As noted above, coal-fired power plants have been linked to acidification in several East Texas lakes. The same lakes have also been contaminated by selenium, a heavy metal linked to the coal-fired power plants. 
<P>
The question of global warming has also not been fully assessed. Scientists from around the world believe that carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere will cause a gradual warming of the Earth, which could have catastrophic effects on agriculture and coastal zones. Fossil fuel-fired electric power plants produce millions of tons of CO2 per year. (See section on air). Some environmental groups favor new regulations that would change the way Texas' electric utilities operate. Called integrated resource planning, the program would encourage utilities to increase efficiency programs. In addition, it would require utilities to take into account the cost of the pollutants that they emit. Many other states, including Nevada, Oregon and New York have adopted similar regulations. But thus far, the Texas Legislature has not required Texas power producers to factor efficiency and pollution issues into their decision-making process. 
<P>
Advances in efficiency could help slow the demand for electricity. High efficiency appliances, lights and motors could go a long way toward reducing Texas' demand for electricity. (See efficiency section below).

In 1977, natural gas accounted for 86 percent of the fuel used to generate electric power in Texas. Increasing use of coal, lignite and nuclear power during the 1980s reduced reliance on natural gas to less than 40 percent of total generation by 1991. Because of its clean burning characteristics, however, gas is expected to increase its share to 42 percent by 2002.

<A NAME="COGENERATION">Cogeneration </A>
</H4>
<P>
Electricity is inherently inefficient to produce. Up to two-thirds of the heat energy in a fuel source is lost while making electric power. Cogeneration is a process that generates electricity and heat at the same time. Cogeneration units are up to 50 percent more efficient than standard power plants.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#74">(74)</A> Industrial users were among the first to embrace cogeneration because it allows large industrial plants to generate electricity while using the heat for industrial processes. In addition, cogeneration units are advocated by some energy analysts because they are cheaper to build than large power units.
<P>
Between 1980 and 1992, the amount of electricity derived from cogeneration has increased tenfold.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#75">(75)</A> Texas now gets more than 7,300 megawatts of power from cogeneration plants. At present, 80 percent of the state's cogeneration plants are operated by petrochemical and chemical producers along the Gulf Coast. 
<P>
Federal regulations require local utilities to purchase excess power from cogeneration facilities. And because of its efficiency, cogeneration is expected to increase. By 2005, some 10,000 megawatts of cogeneration capacity are predicted to be available in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#76">(76)</A>

<H4>TEXAS ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION BY SECTOR</H4>
<IMG SRC="c.econsumpt.gif" BORDER=4 ALIGN=middle ALT="Bar Chart of Electricity Consumption by Sector">
</center>
<P>
Utilities in Texas sold $14.7 billion worth of electricity to 7.7 million customers in 1992. Texas' 59,000 industrial users, only one percent of all customers, provided one-quarter of all revenues and used more than one-third of all power sold.
<P>
Total electricity consumed in 1992: 239.4 trillion kilowatt hours. One kilowatt hour equals the energy consumed by ten 100 watt light bulbs burning for one hour.

<H4>
<A NAME="NUCLEAR">Nuclear Power</A>
</H4>
<P>
In 1942, Dr. Enrico Fermi assembled enough uranium to cause a nuclear fission reaction. Nine years later, in 1951, the first electric power was produced from the atom, when an experimental reactor lit up four light bulbs in a laboratory experiment. Today, more than half of all Texans rely on nuclear power as one of their sources of electricity. But the debate continues over how successful Texas' experiment with nuclear power has been. 
<P>
Texas now has 4,802 megawatts of installed nuclear power capacity coming from two plants: the 2,300-megawatt Comanche Peak project in Somervell County and the 2,502-megawatt South Texas Project in Matagorda County. The combined cost of constructing the two facilities was $15.6 billion.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#77">(77)</A> Part of the reason the plants were so expensive was that construction took many years longer than expected. The two units at Comanche Peak were under construction longer than any nuclear plant now operating in the U.S. Comanche Peak Unit Two got a construction permit in December of 1974, but did not begin operating until August of 1992.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#78">(78)</A> 
<P>
Concerns about safety and construction procedures have also hampered the South Texas Project in Matagorda County. The project got underway in 1975 and began generating power in 1988. It ran ten months before a fire caused the reactor to be shut down for six weeks.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#79">(79)</A> The plant was closed for most of 1993 after Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors discovered problems with maintenance, security and management at the plant. The facility came back on-line in February of 1994, only to shut down a few days later due to a faulty water pump. The plant is now re-opened but under close scrutiny by the NRC to prevent further problems. 
<P>
In 1992, the South Texas Project and Comanche Peak generated nearly 24.5 billion kilowatt hours of electricity, which accounted for more than 10 percent of all the electricity consumed in the state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#80">(80)</A> While the two plants are the only nuclear generating stations in Texas, many state residents consume electricity from nuclear plants located in other states. For instance, El Paso residents may get power from the Palo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona. Many East Texas residents use Louisiana's River Bend nuclear plant for electricity. In all, about 10 million Texans rely on utilities that produce nuclear power.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#81">(81)</A> 
<P>
Some anti-nuclear groups continue to advocate shutting down the nuclear plants immediately. They argue the move would save money for ratepayers over the long term because nuclear plants pose safety problems that could be very expensive to resolve. For instance, an accident like the one that occurred at the Chernobyl plant in the former Soviet Union could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. In addition, they say the long-term storage costs of radioactive waste are too expensive. 
<P>
However, nuclear power proponents point out that when operated correctly, nuclear plants emit little or no carbon dioxide. And they say that the plants will save ratepayers money over the long term because the fuel costs for nuclear power plants are far less than fuel costs for conventional fossil fuel plants. 
<P>
Disposing of radioactive waste from nuclear plants does present a difficult long-term problem. Texas used to send its low-level radioactive waste to a facility in Barnwell, South Carolina. However, that facility has reached its capacity. Low level radioactive waste is now stored above ground at each facility. The state of Texas plans to locate a low-level nuclear waste disposal site in Hudspeth County, but many local residents oppose the project. And even if the facility is approved, it will not open until the late 1990s.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#82">(82)</A> 
<P>
Under Texas law, low-level radioactive waste is defined as waste having a half life of 35 years. By law, all nuclear waste other than used fuel rods from power plants is classified as "low-level." These waste include items such as workers' discarded gloves and paper booties, as well as radioactive cooling water pipes and valves. These waste must be kept isolated for hundreds, if not thousands, of years in areas that are arid, geologically stable, and can be secured for centuries.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#83">(83)</A> Low-level storage facilities must monitor disposal sites for at least 350 years to assure that the waste returns to background levels of radioactivity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#84">(84)</A> 
<P>
A nuclear reactor produces about 30 tons of high-level and low-level radioactive material per year that must be stored safely.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#85">(85)</A> The most dangerous of these waste are spent fuel rods. The highly radioactive fuel rods are even more problematic than low-level waste. The U.S. Department of Energy has proposed a final storage site for the fuel rods at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. However, the site is still being investigated for its suitability and even if it is approved, it will not be ready to accept the spent fuel rods until 2010 at the earliest.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#86">(86)</A> 
<P>
Decommissioning, or shutting down the power plants, presents another long-term problem for the nuclear power industry. Shutting down Texas' nuclear plants will likely cost consumers several billion dollars. The exact cost of decommissioning the plants is unknown because none of the large generators has been decommissioned yet. However, state officials estimate that disposing of low-level waste from a decommissioned plant could cost up to $250 million.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#87">(87)</A> Labor costs and other costs could make the final cost several times that figure. Indeed, the few power plants that have been shut down have cost as much to decommission as they did to construct.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#88">(88)</A> 
<P>
No new nuclear power plants have been ordered in recent years. But new regulations under the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 could make it easier for utilities to build new nuclear generating stations.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#89">(89)</A> Before any new plants are built, however, the public will have to be convinced that viable waste disposal options are available for radioactive waste. In addition, citizens will have to be convinced that the plants are safe, cost competitive and that the mistakes of earlier projects will not be repeated. 
<H4>
<A NAME="URANIUM">Uranium</A>
</H4>
<P>
The nuclear power industry depends on uranium. For decades, Texas was a leading producer of this heavy, silvery-white element which can also be made into nuclear weapons. In the mid-1970s when the price of uranium was more than $40 per pound, nearly a dozen companies were operating some 35 uranium-mining sites in seven South Texas counties. Today, with the price at about $10 per pound, only a handful of companies continue to produce uranium in the state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#90">(90)</A> 
<P>
Uranium used to be strip mined with technology similar to that used in coal mining. These uranium strip mine operations created large areas requiring remediation. Large tailings ponds have been created to contain the radioactive materials. These ponds, located in Karnes and Live Oak Counties, may pose a long-term threat to surface water and subsurface aquifers because they are subject to leakage. Federal law requires the tailings ponds, which contain materials that will remain radioactive for more than 1,600 years, to be covered, so that rainwater does not mix with the radioactive waste. However, these pond coverings may be eroded over time by water and wind, which could allow radium to escape into the atmosphere. The ponds must be monitored for centuries to assure that they are properly containing the radioactive waste. 
<P>
Today, most uranium mining is done with injection wells, which pump fluid through the geologic formations where the mineral is found. Production wells then bring the uranium-bearing solution to the surface. Called "solution mining" or "in-situ" mining, this method causes relatively little disturbance of the surface. However, this process can contaminate groundwater, which must then be disposed of by injection into deep formations below fresh water aquifers.

</H4>
<P>
With its fertile soil, sunny weather and strong winds, Texas holds great promise for renewable energy. Wind energy, solar power, biomass and hydropower could play large roles in the state's energy mix. However, at present, the state derives only about 0.4 percent of its total energy demand from renewable sources.
<H4>
<A NAME="WIND">Wind</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas residents have been harnessing the stiff Texas breeze for decades. Before electrification, rural residents relied on windchargers for electricity. Similar to windmills, these units turned wind energy into electric energy, which was used to charge batteries that powered electric lights and other devices. Rural residents also relied on windmills to pump water. Today, many windmills have been replaced by electric water pumps, but some 80,000 windmills continue to pump water for rural agricultural users in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#101">(101)</A>
<P>
Wind could provide Texas with vast amounts of electricity. Studies have shown that up to 136,000 megawatts of electricity - more than twice the state's total generating capacity - could be generated in Texas if all the state's wind resources could be captured.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#102">(102)</A> Unlike fossil fuel-fired power plants, wind-energy plants do not create carbon dioxide or other air pollutants. 
<P>
Wind farms in California have proven wind can be a reliable energy source. California now gets 1,600 megawatts of power from 17,000 wind turbines and the state is developing 1,500 megawatts of new wind power.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#103">(103)</A> Although California leads the world in wind-energy production, Texas has almost 20 times more wind-energy potential than California. <A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#104">(104)</A> 
<P>
Several utilities have taken note of Texas' wind-energy potential and numerous projects are underway in West Texas. Some 250 megawatts of wind-generated electricity will come on-line in 1995.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#105">(105)</A> While wind-energy shows great potential, several hurdles must be cleared before it will become a major energy source in the state. First, all of the planned wind units will be in the rural areas of West Texas, far from the urban and industrial areas where electric demand is highest. To capture all of these wind resources, new transmission lines will have to be built. No reliable estimates are available regarding the cost of building these new power lines. 
<P>
Second, wind farms can threaten wildlife. For reasons still not clear to biologists, the wind turbines have killed many birds of prey. But wind energy promoters say the bird mortality problem can be solved. 
<P>
The new class of wind turbines can generate power for as little as five cents per kilowatt hour, slightly more than the cost of coal-fired power plants. But when external costs, like air pollution are figured in, wind may be a cheaper power source than either fossil-fuel or nuclear plants.

<H4>
<A NAME="SOLAR">Solar</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas' solar energy potential far exceeds its wind energy potential. If the 262,000 square miles of Texas were covered with solar cells, the state would generate 550 quadrillion Btu's of electrical energy every year. That is equal to one and a half times the total energy used in the world.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#106">(106)</A> Obviously, the state won't ever be paved with solar cells, but Texas could easily incorporate solar power into the fuel mix. 
<P>
Texans already rely on photovoltaic cells to power highway lights, railroad switches, weather stations, outdoor lighting, gate openers and many other devices. Cheaper to install in remote areas than conventional power lines, photovoltaics are gaining popularity as evidenced by their increasingly common application in rural parts of the Third World. 
<P>
Some Texas utilities are looking at increased use of the solar cells as a low-cost, non-polluting source of power generation. For example, the city of Austin electric utility operates two photovoltaic stations that generate 450 kilowatts of electric power - enough to supply 50 to 100 homes. The Austin utility is the largest solar power producer in the state. 
<P>
As the price of producing photovoltaics continues to decline, solar cells could become a more common source of power. For example, utility companies in California have begun installing photovoltaic systems on residential rooftops. 
<P>
Solar water heaters could decrease demand for natural gas and electricity. In use for decades, solar water heaters are relatively inexpensive and can heat water for household use or provide space heating during winter months. To cut electricity usage, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District has financed the installation of solar water heaters on its customers' rooftops. Some 1,800 residents in the California town have now installed the units, which are providing hot water at a cost far lower than electrical heating units.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#107">(107)</A> 
<P>
Thermal solar power generators also offer great promise. Already installed in California, these systems use reflective mirrors to concentrate sunlight, which then heats oil or water to generate steam. That steam then drives a turbine which generates electricity. This technology is now being tested in West Texas.

<H4>
<A NAME="HYDRO">Hydro</A>
</H4>
<P>
The stored energy of water has been used by humans for centuries. Streams and rivers were dammed or re-routed to provide power for milling grain or cutting lumber. Today, dams are an important part of the Texas economy, providing water for irrigation and recreation as well as electricity for industrial and residential use. 
<P>
Dams in Texas provide 529 megawatts of electric generating capacity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#108">(108)</A> While that is only a fraction of the state's total electric needs, these hydropower facilities are non-polluting and provide reliable power. However, expanding the state's hydropower base may be difficult, as dams can adversely affect aquatic habitat and free-flowing streams. 
<H4>
<A NAME="BIOMASS">Biomass</A>
</H4>
<P>
Three communities in Texas - Center, Cleburne and Carthage - are using municipal solid waste to generate electricity. (However, this is not a perfect technology. See <I>Municipal Solid Waste </I>Chapter.) Half of the lumber companies and three-fourths of the paper companies in Texas burn wood waste to generate power.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#109">(109)</A> Texas generates huge amounts of plant and animal waste that could be utilized for thermal power generation. Every year, Texas produces some two quadrillion Btu's of energy in the form of agricultural waste, municipal waste and energy crops.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#110">(110)</A> If all that energy could be recovered, it would be enough to generate two-thirds of all the electricity used in Texas. State agencies are now examining how biomass might be used to generate electricity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#111">(111)</A>
<P>
As a large grain-producing state, Texas may be able to use some of its farm production to make ethanol and methanol, which can be used as a motor fuel. They can also be combined with gasoline. Ethanol is an alcohol-based fuel made from fermenting grains and sugars. Methanol can be produced from municipal solid waste, crop residues, natural gas or coal. However these fuels have drawbacks. Methanol is highly toxic. Ethanol contains less heat energy than gasoline. Thus, vehicles running on ethanol get about 30 percent fewer miles per gallon than similar gasoline-powered vehicles. Both methanol and ethanol emit gases that are suspected carcinogens.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#112">(112)</A> These drawbacks could limit the use of these fuels. 
<P>
Increased use of biomass as an energy source has only recently gained attention. But this resource could play a larger role in Texas' renewable energy mix.

<A NAME="SAFELY">INDUSTRIAL</A> SOLID WASTE: WHERE TO SAFELY PUT IT?
</H4>
<P>
Industrial solid waste can be managed either on-site - at the facility where it is generated - or off-site at commercial facilities. Whether on-site or off-site, industrial solid waste can be disposed of through the use of municipal and industrial wastewater facilities; land disposal facilities such as landfills, waste pits - principally for petroleum exploration waste - and deep underground injection wells; and incineration or waste-to-energy facilities like cement kilns. A variety of treatment, recycling and other management options also exist for many types of industrial waste. 
<P>
About 96 percent of hazardous waste and 99 percent of Class 1 waste were managed on site (at the facility where the waste is generated) in 1991. The majority of on-site management is through wastewater treatment facilities, which consist of storage and treatment tanks as well as more complex wastewater treatment.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#46">(46)</A> Once the level of hazardous waste is decreased to a certain level by treatment, the water is then discharged, either through a publicly-owned (wastewater) treatment works or from the industrial facility itself. Besides on-site waste-water facilities, most of the other waste managed on-site was injected underground into deep wells.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#47">(47)</A>

<I>Maquiladoras</I> are manufacturing plants located in Mexico which import at least 75 percent of their raw materials, assemble them in Mexico and export a finished product, usually to the U.S. In 1991, 673 <I>maquiladoras </I>were located along the Texas-Mexico border.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#53">(53)</A> Most of these <I>maquiladoras </I>are at least partially owned by U.S. corporations and use U.S. raw materials to make products such as semiconductors, electronic components, chemicals and auto parts. 
<P>
Under both Mexican law and a U.S.-Mexico agreement, the waste from production must also be returned to the country from which the raw materials were imported.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#54">(54)</A> Despite this requirement, however, Texas commercial facilities reportedly only treated 1,800 tons of hazardous waste from Mexico in 1991.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#55">(55)</A> While little is known about the actual amount of hazardous waste generated in maquila plants, evidence suggests that the volume of hazardous waste is many times higher than what is returned. The World Bank, for example, estimated that 80 percent of the hazardous waste is not repatriated, but remains stored on-site or is otherwise illegally disposed of in Mexico.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#56">(56)</A>
<P>
A new hazardous waste tracking system, called HAZTRAKS, was implemented in 1993 by the Environmental Protection Agency to better track how much hazardous waste was being imported from Mexico and to also help determine if hazardous waste regulations were being violated. The computer system uses the "cradle-to-grave" hazardous waste manifests to record the waste from its initial generation and transport to its disposal. EPA officials are sent manifests from U.S. Customs about a week after the shipments cross the border, while the final manifests finally reach HAZTRAKS some six months after the border crossing. In addition, Mexico has provided information to the system from its import and export guides filed by companies with its government.
<P>
Mexico also currently has a ban on the import of hazardous waste for disposal. However, the country does allow the import of waste if it is used to recycle or recover valuable materials. For example, cement kiln facilities are allowed to import hazardous waste if they use it to help power their production process. This recycling exemption on the ban of hazardous waste is controversial. In 1991, Texas industries shipped about 25,224 tons of hazardous waste to commercial management facilities for recycling in Mexico.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#57">(57)</A>

WHAT ARE "TOXICS" AND WHERE DO THEY GO?
</th></tr><tr><td>
All major manufacturing industries must report their releases and transfers of more than 300 individual toxic chemicals and 20 toxic chemi-cal compounds - chemicals which have been determined to be harmful to humans and/or the environment - to both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. Of these specific chemicals, 123 are defined as carcino-gens based on work-place standards, while chemicals like ozone depleters may affect the environment more directly than humans.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#60">(60)</A> 
<P>
Texas facilities released 381 million pounds of these toxic chemicals in 1993 to the air, water and land -- both above and below the ground -- while transferring another 91 million pounds to other authorized facilities for treatment, storage and disposal.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#61">(61)</A> Texas is the second largest volume producer of toxic chemical releases and the largest producer of releases and transfers in the country.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#62">(62)</A> However, it should be noted that Texas is also the second largest state in terms of population, and has the largest concentration of certain types of industries such as chemicals and petroleum refining. 
<P>
From 1987 to 1993, Texas showed a 23.2 percent reduction in on-site releases and off-site transfers.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#63">(63)</A> In fact, Texas industries have reduced toxic productions faster than industries in other states. However, interpreting these numbers is difficult. Each year there are a different number of facilities reporting. The amount of toxic releases and transfers is affected by the amount of production and general economic conditions. Still, most major companies have significantly reduced toxic releases over the last five years (see section on waste minimization and source reduction).

<A NAME="EXPORTS">EXPORTS</A>, IMPORTS AND COMMERCIAL TREATMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE
</H4>
<P>
Only 4 percent of hazardous waste in Texas was treated off-site in 1991. That year, 4,414,400 tons of hazardous waste were treated at domestic wastewater facilities; 470,000 tons were treated at commercial facilities in Texas; 315,300 tons were sent out-of-state to commercial facilities; and another 201,300 tons went to other "captive" facilities owned by the same company.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#48">(48)</A> More than 40 percent of Texas-generated hazardous waste which went to commercial treatment facilities was exported to other states.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#49">(49)</A> Texas imported about the same amount of hazardous waste as it exported. Most of the imported hazardous waste went to commercial deep-well injection facilities.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#50">(50)</A>
<P>
In addition to these hazardous waste, in 1991 Texas facilities sent 613,700 tons of Class 1 non-hazardous waste - out of 103 million tons generated - to commercial facilities.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#51">(51)</A> There are just a few facilities in the state which manage only non-hazardous industrial waste commercially. For example, 398,000 tons of industrial waste were sent to either in-state or out-of-state landfills in 1991.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#52">(52)</A> Contaminated soils and solids, asbestos materials and PCB contaminated materials made up about 67 percent of the "non-hazardous" industrial waste. Most of the remainder was shipped to a commercial injection well.
<P>
Is there enough space available to take care of all of these waste? In most cases, yes. In a 1994 report on commercial capacity, the TNRCC found that there would be sufficient space to manage Texas waste in 1995, except in the following categories:
<P>
<OL>
	<LI>  Recovery technologies - zinc recovery and carbon filter regeneration;
	<P>
	<LI>  Treatment and destruction technologies, such as reduction and neutralization of inorganic compounds, biological treatment and carbon adsorption, among others; 
	<P>
	<LI>  Landfills for non-hazardous industrial waste and for some treated hazardous waste.
</OL>
<P>
The report found that Texas was lacking in some technologies to recycle and destroy hazardous waste, yet (with the exception of landfilling) had enough disposal capacity for waste that can't be destroyed or recycled. It also noted that a limited number of facilities may be available nationally to manage these waste streams.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#58">(58)</A> In late 1994, a new hazardous waste landfill in Andrews County was permitted, which should provide additional capacity by 1996.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#59">(59)</A>

These extra pounds were not included due to the companies' misunderstanding over whether ammonia sulfate had been delisted in 1993.

	<LI><A NAME="46">"Federal</A> support programs focus on four crops that account for 65 percent of total herbicide use - corn, cotton, soybeans and wheat. Commodity payments to those farmers enrolled in the programs are tied to the "...average acreage they planted in the program crop for the past five years. The result is that farmers cannot practice crop rotation without losing part of their base acreage and thereby reducing their income support payments." In addition, commodity set-aside programs, where acreage is left idle, unfortunately encourage more intensive cultivation and increased use of pesticides on remaining acreage to maximize profit. Moreover, "...fruits and vegetables rely on grading standards; cosmetic standards are generally used as a proxy for quality, resulting in increased pesticide application to control unsightly but inconsequential pest damage."

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+3>Practical Tips for Choosing</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>the Right College</FONT><P>
by Miriam Weinstein<BR> 
editor, Making A Difference College Guide: Outstanding Colleges to Help You 
Make A Better World<BR>
</CENTER>

<P>
<font size=+1>



What should you look for in a college if you want to use your education to find
meaningful work and to make a better world?  There are several different aspects you may
want to investigate follow. 
<P>
Does the college have a mission statement? Read it -
some talk about turning out educate d students, others talk about turning out
compassionate citizens. Quaker and Mennonite  colleges have long-standing
concerns for peace and social justice. 
<P>
Look at the majors offered. If the school
does not have an environmental studies department, you may well wonder what day
and age the school is living in. Do note that some colleges  have a geography or
biology major that is quite akin to environmental studies. Check further by
giving the career office a call - and see what lines  of work students are g oing
in to.
<P>
Look for majors such as urban planning, public health, forestry, social work,
peace studies,  conservation biology, women's studies, ethnic studies, or
science, technology & values. Consider a school with enough  relevant majors to
be sure it really ca res about preparing you for meaningful work. 
<P>
Next, get a
hold of the catalog. Look at  the required courses (if any.) Are they English 1,
Economic 1, and Political Science 1? Or are there interdisciplinary freshman and
sophomore seminars and courses such as "Moral and Ethical Decisions in Public
Life", "Prejudice, Discrimination and Responsibility,"  or "World Hunger" 
offered? While many outstanding colleges might not  offer seminars such as these,
you will see that interdisciplinary education is very prominent, and that often
you can design an major of your own choosing. 
<P>
Look at the contents of the
courses in the majors that  sound of interest to you. Courses in the economics
department give a lot of insight into the spirit of a college. Do you find mo
stly business oriented courses on "International Investment," "Macroeconomics
101," "Money, Credit and Banking" or  "Economics of Natural Resources,"
"Economics of Health," " Political Economy, "  "Economics of Labor." You have
just learned whether the c ourses offer a relevant social analysis. 
<P>
The
religious studies department can also be very telling - how many of the worlds
religions are incorporated - and in what depth? Now you've glimpsed if the
school's perspective is global, and how sensitive it is to today's increasingly
multicultural society. 
<P>
Does the school have an explicit concern for the
environment, reflected in a high percentage of environmentally related courses?
If it lists an environmental major - but the catalog just cross-references you to
other departments, I think you can justifiably be concerned about the importance
of the department to the administration.
<P>
Does the school have a strong service ethic?  The national rate of community
service at colleges is still under 5%. At a "Making A Difference" college, you
will usually  find  at least 30% of students doing community service. 
<P>
How
supportive is the colleg e -- is there a well-funded office coordinating and
promoting service? Is it staffed 5 hours a week or 40?  Even more essential,
does the school offer service-learning programs -  a blossoming new area in higher
education, where students go out into the re al world, and do real work, at the
request of local communities, and integrate their learning and their work while 
receiving full credit. So, for a course in  say "Economics of Poverty" you
might work with children at a school in a low-income neighborh ood.
<P>
Does the college offer or is it affiliated with international service-learning
programs which enable you to receive credit for working in poor countries at the
local level  - living with villagers rather than in dorms, and helping to design
a sustainable agricultural system,  or build a water cistern so  children can
attend school. 
<P>
This is also called experiential education  - and it's considered
the most effective form of learning because it makes your learning vital, and
engaged in the real world - wit h you as an active participant. You may easily
forget what you read in a textbook, you won't so quickly forget being out "in the
field"  working in a health clinic in the mountains of Ecuador. 
<P>
Does the school have a strong internship program? Internships not only give you
job experience so necessary today, but enable you to see if the field you are
considering working in is really a good fit. Many students find a job offer
waiting for them upo n graduation from agency  for which they worked.
<P>
If you think that spending your life trying to make a better world means a life
of financial struggle, think again. Not only can graduates find interesting
employment opportunities, with good starting salaries, in some fields the
employment opportunities are way above average. 
<P>
In today's job market you are as
likely to get as high a starting salary in  policy planning or gerontology (the
study of the elderly) as in law! 
<P>
Forest engineering graduates find 100%
employment - while civil engineers are having a tough time finding any placement.
 Furthermore, when your work is personally meaningful to you, you will be happier
. 
<P>
Personal satisfaction is something which no high salary can buy. Law students
are turning increasingly to public interest law instead o f corporate law - not
only because it's where the jobs are today, but also because it's where their
hearts are. Non-profits are hiring all over the country - and some of them even
help repay a students college loans.
<P>
For
many top students there seems to be an automatic thought process about which
colleges to apply to: either your local college or state university, or the most
selective big name schools. Consider looking further - the best education for you
may be found elsewhere. Often it is to your advantage to be a big fish in a
medium or small bowl, rather than a medium fish is a big bowl. 
<P>
At universities
and prestigious institutions, professors are hired for their research. While they
may be brilliant in their fields, being a brilliant researcher hasn't yet been
shown to correlate with being a brilliant professor. And if you are at a
university, these professors seldom teach on the undergraduate level.
<P>
Check out
the size of freshman lecture halls at universities - they can be from 100 to even
400 students, and frequently taught by graduate students. And accessible
professors? Well - maybe if you are the star student. On the other hand,
universities can offer a mind-boggling array of majors, greater opportunities to
participate in advanced res earch (although usually for graduate students) and
vast resources.
<P>
Many of the lesser known colleges may offer
you more of what you are looking for. Small classes (sometimes 8 to 10 students,)
accessible professors hired for their teaching ability, an administration and
faculty that share your values, and an innovative, caring and responsive
institution. At a small  or medium size college (and I define medium as under
3,000 students, small as under 1,000 students) you are unlikely to fall through
the cracks. 
<P>
Be aware that if you are considering graduate school, you'll find
they are often more interested in the person who graduates at the top of the
class than the person in the middle - regardless of the institution.
<P>

ndrei Zot&#248;v is near the end of his 3-week tour of Central Texas.  On this night,
10 Russian students and their leader, Vadim Kalinin, have prepared a traditional
five-course Russian meal for their host families in Austin.  The students whirl
about the kitchen with great purpose and our GreenBeat reporter waits for Andrei
to finish his duties before he can step outside to discuss his involvement with
the Russian environmental program.

"Before the breakup of the Soviet Union," says Andrei, "my father was a
scientist.  I had alway thought I would be one as well. Now scientists make very
little money so my father has taken another job where he is only a manager.  This
change was very hard for my family, I lost sense of what I might do with my own
life."

I met Vadim while at Obninsk College (equivalent to a U.S. high school). He is
one of the first formal environmental teachers in all of Russia.  He started an
environmental club and I joined.  We have taken many trips and seen many
interesting things about the natural world.  This has given me a way of seeing
that is more (Andrei gestures in circles he searches for the English word),
Ecological."

"Now I plan to become an environmental scientist."  says Andrei.  "After college
I hope to attend the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology."<P>

<H5>Texas Environmental Almanac, Chapter 6, Air 
Quality, Page 2</H5>

<P>
<H4>
<A NAME="CLEAN">THE 1990 FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT
</A></H4>
<P>
With the passage of the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act, Congress toughened national efforts to control air pollution. The 1990 Act addressed some new areas in the field of air pollution control. For the first time, Congress took measures to reduce airborne toxics, acid rain and the depletion of the ozone layer. It strengthened efforts to reduce urban air pollution, in part by imposing new restrictions on mobile sources (cars) and it adopted new market-based approaches to pollution control.
<P>
<B>Criteria Pollutants.</B> The 1970 and 1977 Federal Clean Air Acts required that local metropolitan areas be evaluated by state agencies and the Environmental Protection Agency to determine whether they meet air-quality standards for five pollutants: ozone, carbon monoxide, total suspended particulate matter, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. By the time the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act was passed, lead had been added as a criteria pollutant (October, 1978) and particulate matter less than 10 microns in diamter, known as PM10, replaced total suspended particulates (July, 1987). 
<P>
In areas determined not to meet standards for any criteria pollutant, the state air pollution control agency (the TNRCC in Texas) has the responsibility to work with local county and city governments and regional planning commissions to develop and enact a plan to clean up the air. 
<P>
Some 96 metropolitan areas in the U.S. did not meet the standards for ozone as of April, 1993.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#10">(10)</A> Under the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act, all but 10 of these cities must meet ozone standards by 1999 at the latest, and all but Los Angeles, CA - the most heavily polluted city - must comply by 2007. (Los Angeles has until 2010). Similarly, if an area does not meet federal standards for other criteria pollutants, a plan must be developed and implemented to reduce emissions of those pollutants.
<P>
<B>Airborne Toxics. </B>The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act added additional protections against air toxics by ordering the EPA to identify industries that release toxic chemicals and requiring major sources of these chemicals to install "maximum achievable control technology" by the year 2003. Sources other than major sources would be required to install less costly forms of control. There are currently 189 compounds identified by Congress and the EPA as toxic. Compounds may be added or deleted from the list through a petition process. Despite these improvements, there is still debate about whether these control technology levels will be stringent enough to protect those living near industries that emit hazardous air pollutants. For example, some environmental groups have faulted the Act for not putting more stringent controls on certain toxic emissions from large industrial sectors such as utilities - which often release mercury and cadmium emissions - and steel manufacturers - which often release carcinogenic compounds from coke ovens.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#11">(11)</A>
<P>
<B>Acid Rain.</B> Emissions of sulfur dioxide - one of the gases that produces acid rain - are subject to stronger controls and monitoring. Power plants will be limited to 8.9 million tons per year of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2000, down from 19 million tons per year emitted in 1980. This reduction will be accomplished in two phases, with the 110 "dirtiest" utilities (those with the most emissions) - most of which are in the Midwest - accounting for most of the cuts by 1995. By 2000, the remaining major utilities, including those in Texas, must also reduce sulfur dioxide emissions.
<P>
<B>Atmospheric Ozone. </B>Ozone can be helpful or harmful to humans and the environment depending on where it is. High above the earth in the stratosphere, an ozone layer protects life on earth from harmful ultra-violet radiation from the sun. At ground level, though, ozone is a harmful constituent of smog. The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act phased out the production of certain chemicals that may deplete the stratospheric ozone layer and regulated the disposal of other possible ozone-depleting substances. For example, methyl chloroform, a solvent widely used in such products as automobile brake cleaner and fabric spot removers, must be phased out by 1996.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#12">(12)</A> Freon, the refrigerant used in the majority of air conditioning units, is also being phased out.
<P>
<B>Mobile Sources.</B> The Federal Clean Air Act imposed reductions in the amount of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides present in tailpipe exhaust for all 1994 vehicles and required that these standards be maintained for 100,000 miles. The Act also dictated the sale of only "reformulated" gasoline, which reduces volatility and toxic components and increases oxygen content, in the cities with the highest levels of ground-level ozone pollution and the sale of gasoline with a higher oxygen content in those cities that exceed standards for carbon monoxide. In Texas, the reformulated gasoline requirements apply to Houston, while oxygenated fuel requirements apply in El Paso. In cities where ozone pollution exceeds standards, the Federal Act requires consumers have their car or vehicle tailpipe emissions tested. Vehicles that do not meet the emission standards they were built to meet would have to be repaired. 
<P>
Finally, the Act encouraged the development and sale of alternative fuels such as ethanol, liquified petroleum gas and natural gas by requiring manufacturers to begin producing such cars for sale - starting with the manufacture of 500,000 of these clean-fuel cars for sale in Southern California in 1999.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#13">(13)</A> The Act also required private and government owners of large fleets of cars to purchase certain alternative fuel vehicles for their fleets in those cities with the most severe ozone problems (see section on Mobile Sources).
<P>
<B>Using the Market to Control Pollution.</B> The 1990 Clean Air Act significantly changed the government's approach to controlling air pollution, embracing for the first time a market-based strategy designed to give companies incentives to comply. 
<P>
Here's how the system works. Under Title IV of the Clean Air Act, each of the 110 electric utilities with the most sulfur dioxide emissions is granted a set number of pollution "allowances," based on its historical fuel use. An allowance is equivalent to one ton of sulfur dioxide emissions. Each utility may emit sulfur dioxide up to the limit imposed by its allowances. However, if a utility emits less than its allotted amount by being more efficient, using a lower-sulfur fuel or using a renewable energy source like solar or hydroelectric power, it may sell its unused allowances to another utility as "pollution credits." Conversely, if a utility cannot stay within the limits imposed by its allowances, it can buy pollution credits from a less polluting utility. The system has two major advantages: it rewards companies that pollute less and yet it is flexible enough to accommodate companies which can not meet the standard of pollution control.  
<P>
In addition to the allowances granted to companies based upon historical fuel use, 300,000 allowances (about 2.8 percent of the nearly 11 million tons of sulfur dioxide emitted each year) are placed in a special "Energy and Renewable Energy" reserve to reward companies for adopting new efficiency measures or renewable energy projects. These reserve allowances can either be sold directly by the company or be auctioned through the Chicago Board of Trade. On March 29, 1993, buyers at the Chicago Board of Trade paid $21.4 million for the right to emit 150,010 tons of sulfur dioxide.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#15">(15)</A> 
<P>
In 2000, a second phase of the program will extend "basic" allowances to all electric-steam utilities generating more than 25 megawatts. These two phases should help reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from 19 million to 8.9 million tons per year between 1985 and 2010.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#16">(16)</A> 
<P>
In theory, the market-based approach is designed to reduce pollution in the most cost-effective manner. The traditional "command and control" approach usually employed in environmental legislation would have required two different companies to reduce emissions in the same way. The market system permits Company A to reduce emissions to meet the requirements for both emitters and then sell some of these allowances to Company B at a lower price than would be needed for B to reduce pollutants. 
<P>
Still, there are potential flaws in this "free trade" system. For example, the allowance program assumes that reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions will be of equal benefit to human health and the environment regardless of where they are made. This is not always true; some areas of the country are more prone to acid rain than others. The Adirondack Council, the local governing structure of the famous state park in upstate New York, has protested the fact that New England utilities will be allowed to sell pollution credits to Midwestern utilities, whose pollution is the source of acid rain already damaging Northeastern forests, lakes and rivers.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#17">(17)</A>

<TABLE BORDER=5 WIDTH="85%">
<TR><TH>Market Incentives in Texas</th></tr>
<tr><td>Texas is actively developing a variety of market-based mechanisms to reduce air pollution, including ozone, nitrogen oxide and pollution from cars. A few of these programs are described below.
<P>
<B>Emission Reductions Credit Banking Program. </B>Under the Federal Clean Air Act, any major new source of emissions in those areas that do not meet ozone standards -  Houston/Galveston/Brazoria, Dallas/Fort Worth, El Paso and Beaumont/Port Arthur - must be more than offset by the reduced emissions from existing sources. For example, in order for a new industry that emits 50 tons per year of either nitrogen oxide or volatile organic compounds to locate in the El Paso area, there must be a corresponding reduction of 60 tons per year of those pollutants within El Paso. 
<P>
<B>"Emission reduction credits"</B> are seen as a flexi-ble alternative that allows growth to occur while still reducing overall pollution as required by the Clean Air Act. Under Texas' "Emissions Reductions Banking Rule," adopted in 1993, sources of VOCs and nitrogen oxide emissions receive emission reduction credits if they reduce emissions below the level required by law, either through a permanent reduction in emissions or by closing an emission source. These reduction credits are certified by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) and recorded or "deposited" in the Emissions Reductions Bank. A company can then sell its credits to companies within the same non-attainment area to new industries arriving in the area that need offsets for new permits or expansion of existing facilities.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#14">(14)</A> 
<P>
<B>Nitrogen Oxide Trading. </B>In Houston/Galveston and Beaumont/Port Arthur, all major sources of nitrogen oxide such as utilities and petroleum refineries are required to achieve specific reductions in emissions by May 31, 1997 using "Reasonably Available Control Technology" (RACT). Under a new rule passed by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, rather than meeting this 1997 compliance deadline through RACT, a source could instead continue to emit previous levels of emissions by buying emission credits. For example, a source with multiple emission units could trade across units to achieve allowable emission levels even if some individual units did not comply. Or, two different facilities could trade among themselves so that the total emissions averaged out to the compliance level of emissions for the area. Under the Nitrogen Oxide RACT rule, however, a company could not use emission credits to increase pollution, only to meet the RACT emission limits. 
<P>
<B>Alternative Fuels Program. </B>Under a new rule adopted by the TNRCC, vehicles using conventional fuels in a private or public fleet which needs to comply with Clean Air Act requirements could be converted or scrapped in favor of vehicles using cleaner fuels not currently required by regulation. The resulting decrease in emissions would generate mobile emission reduction credits, which could be sold to other fleet operators unable to comply with fleet regulations.

<H4><A NAME="NATIONAL">NATIONAL</A> AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
</H4>
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act contained other market-based approaches to pollution control. The EPA may now issue allowances to companies for the manufacture of chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that deplete atmospheric ozone even though the manufacture of these chemicals is being phased out. The Act also has provisions that allow one facility's reductions in ozone-forming pollutants or toxic chemicals to offset increased emissions at another facility. Texas has embraced several of these new market-based approaches in its effort to reduce pollution.
<P>
How these efforts will ultimately improve air quality is still unknown. The EPA says that 90 million Americans live in cities that are non-attainment for at least one of the six main air pollutants targeted by the Federal Clean Air Act.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#18">(18)</A> In addition, there are possible global problems -  such as ozone depletion and global warming -  which may defy strictly national solutions. Other "air" issues, such as indoor air pollution, are not addressed by the Federal Clean Air Act at all.
<P>
Moreover, none of the changes mandated by the law come cheaply. Industries large and small will feel the effects of the Federal Clean Air Act. For example, in areas of the state not meeting ozone standards, tough new emission standards will require businesses to install expensive pollution control equipment. These businesses will also have to apply for new federal operating permits. In some sectors, such as electric utilities and petroleum refineries, these requirements have already led to some job losses. Even small businesses like dry cleaners, bakeries and printers will have to install new equipment to control emissions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. Because the Federal Clean Air Act greatly expanded the scope of government regulation, the government's cost of monitoring and enforcing air-quality law has also increased.  
<P>
These anticipated economic impacts were the main source of opposition to the bill. Still, the Act will create new markets for alternative fuels, pollution control equipment and new services, thus creating new jobs. And supporters believe that the economic value of the Act's public-health benefits - measured in fewer sick days, hospitalizations and deaths - will more than offset initial economic costs.

With 18 million cars on its roads, 442 electric utility generators using gas, oil, coal and other sources of fuel, 60 percent of the nation's petrochemical production, 25 percent of the nation's refining capacity and a population of more than 18 million people, Texas must grapple with the full range of clean air issues. The state consistently ranks at or near the top of the list in air toxic emissions, reflective of the disproportionate amount of petrochemical production relative to the rest of the country. Half of the state's population lives in "non-attainment" cities, which do not meet federal standards for clean air.
<P>
This chapter discusses air quality in Texas, outlining the problems and summarizing the efforts to deal with it. It is divided into six sections:
<P>
<B><OL>
	<LI>  National Ambient Air Quality Standards
	<P>
	<LI>  Clean Air Act Compliance in Texas
	<P>
	<LI>  Other Air Quality Issues
	<P>
	<LI>  Mobile Sources
	<P>
	<LI>  Major Stationary Sources 
	<P>
	<LI>  Small Businesses and Minor Stationary Sources
</OL>
</B><P>
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Acts set forth air quality standards for six pollutants: ozone (03), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), respirable particulate matter (PM10) and lead (Pb). The Environmental Protection Agency has determined an allowable limit for each of these pollutants that is intended to protect the public from exposure to dangerous levels. These national standards are known as the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
<P>
One set of standards, called primary standards, is designed to protect human health. Another set, called secondary standards, is designed to protect the environment and limit property damage. Any area of a city that exceeds a standard causes the entire metropolitan area to be in violation. Since the EPA began regulating these pollutants, levels of all have declined. Most emissions have shown a modest decline. The exception is lead, which showed a sharp decline (90 percent) between 1982 and 1991. This dramatic reduction is due largely to the phase out of leaded gasoline which began in the 1970s. Today, the most abundant single pollutant is carbon monoxide, accounting for about 50 percent of total emissions by weight. 
<P>
At monitoring stations around the state, the four gaseous criteria pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO, and O3) are monitored continuously, with one-hour averages measured each hour, every day. PM10 and lead are measured at least once every six days for a 24-hour averaging period, although some sites in Texas are monitored more frequently. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, local governmental agencies and some private organizations monitor for criteria pollutants (see box in text on monitoring).

<H4>
<A NAME="OZONE">A. OZONE</A>
</H4>
<P>
In the upper atmosphere, ozone (O3), an oxygen molecule with three, rather than two, oxygen atoms, forms a layer that filters out ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Concern about the thinning of the atmospheric ozone layer has led to bans on the use of certain chemicals, such as chlorinated fluorocarbons, that may destroy ozone. 
<P>
Though atmospheric ozone helps sustain life, ozone formed near the ground may adversely affect plants, animals and humans. Ozone is produced when reactive hydrocarbons known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) combine with nitrogen oxides in the presence of sunlight. Ozone problems are most common in the hot summer months because the warm air and sunlight speed ozone formation. 
<P>
Volatile organic compounds are emitted from a wide variety of sources. These include automobiles and other vehicles (referred to as "mobile sources" in the Federal Clean Air Act); refineries and chemical manufacturing plants ("major stationary sources"); paint shops and dry cleaners ("minor" or "area sources"); recreational boats, ships, barges, lawn and garden equipment, aircraft, and locomotives ("off-road mobile sources"); and plants and trees ("biogenics"). Yes, even trees contribute to VOCs (see box in text). Nitrogen oxide comes from some of the same sources - automobiles, boats, trains and planes, and refineries - as well as from service stations, home heating and cooling units, wastewater treatment plants, power plants and forest fires. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has estimated both the amount and the sources of VOCs and NOx released into the atmosphere in major Texas metropolitan areas.
<P>
<B>Non-Attainment Areas.</B>
<P>
Four metropolitan areas in Texas have exceeded the national standards for ozone often enough to be currently classified as non-attainment areas. They are: Houston/Galveston/Brazoria, Beaumont/Port Arthur, Dallas/Fort Worth and El Paso. The Houston/Galveston/Brazoria metropolitan area reports the highest numbers of days exceeding ozone standards in Texas. In general, Texas cities have shown a decline over the past 10 years in the number of days exceeding national standards. Other large Texas cities like Austin, San Antonio and Corpus Christi have met the ozone standard since the early 1980s. Still, in both 1993 and 1994, Corpus Christi exceeded the one-hour ozone standards on one occassion, and Austin and San Antonio approached it.
<P>
<B>Health and Environmental Effects of Ozone.</B>
<P>
High levels of ozone - including levels above the 0.125 parts per million standard - can have serious human health effects. Ozone reacts with lung tissue and can cause breathing problems. The risk of asthma may be increased and people may cough and have chest pains. For unknown reasons, about 10 to 20 percent of the population, sometimes referred to as "responders," is especially sensitive to high ozone concentrations. This group, along with people with pre-existing respiratory diseases and people who exercise outdoors, are particularly at risk from high ozone levels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#20">(20)</A> 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">A 1988 study for the American Lung Association estimated that if ozone standards had been met throughout the United States in 1983, 49.9 million cases of adverse health symptoms and 1.9 million asthma attacks would have been eliminated.

<P>
High ground levels of ozone can also have negative environmental effects. It is believed to affect crop and forestry production by damaging the cell walls of plants. In 1987, the East Texas Intensive Research Site was established near Nacogdoches to investigate how pollutants affect the development of one- to four-year-old short leaf pines along coastal plains. The study subjected some trees to persistent exposure to ozone and the trees showed loss of needles, stunted growth and fewer stems.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#21">(21)</A>

<tr><th>DO TREES POLLUTE?</th></tr>
<tr><td>
Do trees pollute? In the early 1980s, then-President Ronald Reagan and some noted scientists attracted attention when they confirmed that trees themselves are a possible source of some types of air pollution. Trees do contribute to the formation of ozone by releasing volatile organic compounds such as isoprene, monoterpene and alpha-pinene. 
<P>
Under Title 1 of the Federal Clean Air Act, states are required to estimate how much trees and plants contribute to VOC production for those areas that exceed ozone standards. The sources of these VOCs, known collectively as "biogenics," include forests, crops, lawn grasses and other vegetation. The more vegetation an area has, the more these biogenics will contribute to overall VOC levels. For example, biogenics are estimated to account for 22 percent of all VOCs emitted in the woody Houston/Galveston area, but only 12 percent in the arid El Paso area.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#19">(19)</A> Of course, biogenic sources are natural sources of air pollution and no one is suggesting that trees be cut to reduce pollution. In fact, the air quality benefits of biogenics far outweigh the costs since plants produce oxygen, filter the air and prevent erosion. Biogenic sources are not figured into the calculation of how much an area must reduce VOC emissions.

<A NAME="SULFUR">B. SULFUR DIOXIDE</A> AND NITROGEN OXIDES - THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF ACID RAIN
</H4>
<P>
Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are gases released when fossil fuels are burned. When these gases react with water in the atmosphere, sulfuric acid and nitric acids can form and fall as rain, commonly referred to as "acid" rain. In areas with little precipitation, the acids may become incorporated into dust and smoke and fall to the ground as "dry" acid.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#22">(22)</A> Acid rain can harm or kill fish by making lakes and rivers more acidic, i.e. by lowering the pH. It can also damage buildings, stone and monuments as well as crops and forests. Studies indicate that acid rain can also reduce crop yields both by damaging foliage and by causing minerals to leach from the soil.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#23">(23)</A>  While adverse affects have been reported in the Northeast, no harmful effects have been documented in Texas. This is because of two factors: 1) the strongly alkaline soils characteristic of much of the state; and 2) the absence of a snow pack melt common in more northern states.
<P>
Both nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide have been linked to the formation of acid rain and acidic lakes. Pinpointing the cause of acid rain is difficult, primarily because of multiple emission sources and complex meteorology. Rain can become acidic as a result of water reacting with nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. But other factors, such as acidic waste runoff and naturally high acidic levels in lakes or streams, may also contribute to acidity. In 1991, the Texas Air Control Board, later the TNRCC, and the federal government began monitoring the acidity (pH) of rain at 15 different sites. In general, the pH was lower - more acidic - in rainfall collected in East Texas.
<P>
Nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides have other harmful effects in addition to their ability to form acid rain deposition. At high levels, nitrogen oxides are known to cause lung damage and other respiratory illness, particularly in children and people suffering from asthma.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#24">(24)</A> In Texas, nitrogen dioxide has never exceeded the national standard set in 1973. It does, however, contribute to the formation of ozone (see previous section). 
<P>
High concentrations of sulfur dioxide in the air may cause difficulty in breathing and a choking sensation. Children, the elderly, asthma sufferers and people with chronic lung and heart disease are particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of sulfur dioxide. 
<P>
Unlike nitrogen oxide - which is mainly the result of automobile and utility emissions - sulfur dioxide is emitted chiefly from industrial sources like power plants using sulfur-containing fuel, metallic-ore smelting facilities, wood and paper industrial processors and oil and gas refineries. 
<P>
Sulfur dioxide levels in Texas vary across the state. The Houston/Galveston/Texas City area, the Beaumont/Port Arthur area, and the El Paso metropolitan area have shown the highest levels of SO2 measured in the state.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#25">(25)</A> While most areas in the state do not exceed or even approach the air quality standards for SO2, tests conducted between 1985 and 1989 by the Houston Regional Monitoring Network, a private organization, showed sulfur dioxide levels in excess of national standards 13 times in the industrial district of the Houston Ship Channel.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#26">(26)</A> Cooperative action between local industries, the TNRCC and the EPA has resulted in a voluntary reduction in SO2 emissions in the local area and no violations have been recorded since 1990.

<A NAME="CARBON">C. CARBON MONOXIDE</A>
</H4>
<P>
A colorless, odorless gas, carbon monoxide results from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, most often in motor vehicles and power plants. Carbon monoxide can interfere with the blood's ability to carry oxygen to the heart, brain and other tissues. People with heart disease and unborn or newborn children are especially susceptible to carbon monoxide poisoning.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#27">(27)</A> The area in Texas where the highest levels of CO are measured is El Paso, but even here, the NAAQS has not been exceeded more than 10 times per year. Carbon monoxide has also been identified as a possible precursor to the formation of ozone.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#28">(28)</A>
<P>
Unlike ozone, carbon monoxide levels usually rise with colder weather, when atmospheric conditions are more stable. In Texas, only El Paso has consistently exceeded the eight-hour standard for carbon monoxide concentrations. Most notably, however, levels measured in recent years are lower than those measured ten years ago. Dallas exceeded standards twice in 1985, while Houston exceeded standards nine times between 1974 and 1986. No other exceedences in these two cities have since been recorded due to state and federal efforts to control carbon monoxide emissions. According to the 1990 EPA data base, El Paso ranked 5th in the nation, behind Steubenville, Ohio; Provo, Utah; Los Angeles, California; and Las Vegas, Nevada for levels of eight-hour concentrations of carbon monoxide.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#29">(29)</A> However, 1994 data places El Paso behind eleven other U.S. cities.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#30">(30)</A>
<P>
El Paso is a special case because it shares a common airshed with Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, Mexico and is affected by that city's air pollution. A special section later in this chapter -  "Sharing Air Along the U.S. - Mexico Border" -  highlights some of these issues. In Texas, the levels and sources of carbon monoxide vary by location.

<A NAME="PARTICULATE">D. PARTICULATE MATTER</A>
</H4>
<P>
The category of air pollutant called "respirable particulate matter" includes liquids, hydrocarbons, soots, dusts, acids from aerosols and smoke particles that are smaller than 10 microns in diameter. This 10-micron size limit has led to the abbreviation of respirable particulate matter as "PM 10." These tiny particles make up about 55 percent of the total mass of suspended particles in air pollution, and come from the burning of fuels by industry, power plants and motor vehicles; from refuse incinerators; from dust created by construction, agriculture and unpaved roads; and from natural sources such as wind erosion.
<P>
While the nose can filter out larger particulates, PM10 can penetrate deep into the lungs. The further a particle penetrates and the higher the concentration, the more likely it is to cause wheezing, nose and throat irritation, bronchitis and lung damage. Chemicals such as toxic compounds attached to PM10 emissions can increase the potential for adverse effects. Groups at high risk include children, the elderly and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions like asthma and emphysema. Beyond these health hazards, PM10 reduces visibility and can discolor clothing and property.
<P>
In 1987, the Environmental Protection Agency revised its air quality standards for PM10, allowing a maximum of 150 micrograms per cubic meter on a 24-hour basis, or 50 micrograms per cubic meter as an annual average. Previously, the EPA had no specific standard for PM10, instead relying on a standard for all particulate matter, including particulate matter larger than 10 microns. The EPA estimates that adherence to these new standards will save 3,600 lives, reduce lost work days by 190,000 days and "reduced-activity" days, when people work less efficiently because of ill health, by 910,000 days.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#31">(31)</A>
<P>

Still there has been considerable debate about whether these levels adequately safeguard human health and some studies have suggested that standards should be strengthened.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#32">(32)</A> A recent study, which controlled for the effects of smoking, found that mortality risks are more strongly associated with concentrations of respirable particles and sulfates - the combination of sulfur dioxide with air - than with other common air pollution problems such as ozone or sulfur dioxide.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#33">(33)</A> 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">Another study tracked 552,138 men and women across the United States from 1982 to 1989 and evaluated the effects of particulate air pollution - including sulfates and fine particulate matter less than 2.5 microns - on mortality. The study found an association between mortality due to cardiopulmonary diseases and particulate matter air pollution.
	<P>

Arden Pope III, Micheal Thun, Mohan Namboodiri, Douglas Dockery, John Evans, Frank Speizer and Clark Heath, Jr., "Particulate Air Pollution as a Predictor of Mortality in a Prospective Study of U.S. Adults," </I>American Journal of Respiratory Critical Care Medicine<I>, Vol. 151 (1995): 669 - 674.</I>
</UL>
<P>
While the EPA is currently reviewing the Federal PM10 standard, some states have already adopted a more stringent standard. For example, the state of California, after reviewing studies on morbidity and mortality from PM10 exposure, adopted a state air-quality standard for particulate matter of 50 micrograms over 24 hours. 
<P>
In Texas, only El Paso County has repeatedly exceeded both the 24-hour and annual standards set in 1987 for PM10. Other areas have occasionally exceeded this standard. In 1992, there were two exceedences out of 337 samples in El Paso. In 1993, there were none, while in 1994, there were two exceedences.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#34">(34)</A> In El Paso, particulate matter levels rise during winter months, due mainly to combustion of wood and other fuels for heating. 
<P>
El Paso is also impacted by particulate matter drifting from Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez in Mexico. Common sources of this particulate matter include unpaved roads and industrial combustion processes such as the incineration of garbage, including tires, without adequate controls. However, without adequate emissions inventories and ambient air quality monitoring in Ciudad Juarez to record air quality over time, it is difficult to determine if emissions are going down. TNRCC, the Environmental Defense Fund and others are working with Mexican environmental officials to address these needs.

<A NAME="LEAD">E. LEAD</A>

<P>
Between 1982 and 1991, air emissions of lead in the United States were reduced from 52,000 to 5,000 tons per year, largely as a result of the country's phase-out of leaded gasoline.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#35">(35)</A> Nevertheless, lead continues to pose a public health threat, in part because of its persistence in the environment. Lead poisoning can lead to retardation in cognitive development in children, reduce mental ability and damage nerves and organs like livers and kidneys. It also may interfere with the creation of blood and raise blood pressure, leading to cardiovascular disease.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#36">(36)</A> Because lead accumulates in the body organs, bones and blood, even chronic exposure to small amounts can be harmful to both human and animal life. Besides leaded gasoline, sources of lead pollution in the air include metal smelters and the manufacture and reclamation of lead batteries. Children and pregnant women are most at risk from exposure to high lead levels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#37">(37)</A>
<P>
In Texas, outside air pollution from lead is now limited to a handful of areas. In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, citizens were concerned about the number of lead smelters and battery plants in the area, but most of these facilities were shut down in the mid-1980s. Suspected health problems from exposure to high lead levels continue to concern Dallas-area residents. However, monitors show no exceedences at this time. In the city of Frisco in Collin County, ambient air levels of lead have exceeded national standards in an area of approximately one-half mile near a major battery plant. However, the last exceedences for lead national standards were in 1987.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#38">(38)</A> Although lead exposure concerns had been raised over a 1.5-mile square surrounding an old battery reclamation plant in San Antonio, the site is currently designated as "unclassified" by the EPA until further monitoring can confirm the levels of lead in the air. 
<P>
In the early and mid-1980s, several monitoring sites in the city of El Paso violated national standards for lead. However, the closing of a lead smelter plant in 1985 and the phase-out of leaded gasoline have brought levels in El Paso to within the allowable limit since 1986. Generally speaking, lead is not a big problem in ambient air in Texas. Thus, there is a greater potential for lead exposure in individual households because of the possible presence of peeling lead-based paint.

<tr><th>AIR QUALITY MONITORING: HOW MUCH DO WE KNOW?
</th></tr><tr><td>
If you can't always see it, taste it, or maybe even smell it, how do you know air pollution is there? Texas' extensive monitoring network strives to answer that question by measuring concentrations of ambient air pollutants. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission operates more than 80 permanent monitoring sites located across the state. In addition, six local governmental entities and four private organizations monitor the six criteria pollutants at other stations in an effort to pinpoint local problems. Many of these stations also monitor air toxics. 
<P>
Despite the presence of these monitors in the major metropolitan areas, federal requirements and citizen concern about the health effects of toxics are generating a demand for more and better air-quality monitoring. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has invested about $1.5 million a year since 1992 to expand and operate its air toxics monitoring network. The agency plans to add 29 new toxic air monitoring stations by the end of 1995. Despite the large volume of toxics released each year into the air by Texas industries, ambient air toxics monitoring by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has not identified them as a significant public health risk.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#39">(39)</A> Air toxics selected for monitoring were those emitted in the largest quantities from multiple sources. While it is not possible to monitor for all chemical compounds emitted, the results of monitoring currently conducted are considered indicative of broad-based public exposure to other compounds by the TNRCC. Some monitoring methods collect average samples of toxics, and thus, higher peak concentrations would not be quantified, although they would be represented as part of the average itself.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#40">(40)</A> 
<P>
To complement its monitoring system, the TNRCC is investing in a more complete toxics monitoring network and expanding its use of mobile monitoring equipment, which includes a self-contained mobile laboratory, sampling vans and an air toxics response trailer.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#41">(41)</A>

<A NAME="ACT"><H4>FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT COMPLIANCE IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
Under Title 1 of the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act, any area that violates National Ambient Air Quality Standards for any of the six criteria pollutants as few as once per year and as often as four times over a three-year period is classified as a "non-attainment area." Texas currently has four such areas, encompassing 17 counties. Victoria County and portions of Bexar County have been designated "unclassified" because their monitoring data for ozone and lead, respectively, have not been adequate to measure pollution levels precisely. The Houston Ship Channel in the Houston metropolitan area had been proposed as a non-attainment area for sulfur dioxide. However, recent cooperative activities by the TNRCC, EPA and industries in the area resulted in the submission of an attainment demonstration to the EPA.
<P>
Non-attainment areas for ozone, CO and PM10 are classified according to the severity of their air pollution. Each area is included in a State Implementation Plan (SIP) designed by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission to bring the area into compliance. Different areas may have different deadlines for complying with the SIP plan, depending upon the severity of their air pollution problem. If a non-attainment area fails to comply with air pollution standards by the deadline, the Environmental Protection Agency may extend the deadline, but impose more stringent requirements to meet the standards. If there is a failure to develop a proper State Implementation Plan or a failure to implement the plan, the Environmental Protection Agency may develop a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for the area and may impose sanctions for non-compliance including the loss of federal highway funds, bans or stiffer limits on further industrial expansion and the loss of federal Air Pollution Control Program grant funds. 
<P>
The economic costs of non-attainment are substantial. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission estimates that it will cost $200 billion to bring Texas' four ozone non-attainment areas into compliance.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#42">(42)</A> By 1996, the four ozone non-attainment areas must reduce levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by 15 percent, net of growth, from 1990 levels. This net reduction requirement means that before any new sources of VOCs can be allowed to operate, reductions must be made in existing sources to offset the new emissions. Thus, the actual total reduction is significantly higher than 15 percent. 
<P>
Once volatile organic compounds are reduced by 15 percent by 1996, serious and severely polluted areas - which include Houston, El Paso and Beaumont - will still be required to reduce either volatile organic compounds and/or nitrogen oxides an average of 3 percent each year for three years, or until standards are met. Thus, future economic growth and reductions in air pollution are linked together. 
<P>
The State Implementation Plan is also requiring consumers, small businesses and major industries in non-attainment areas to radically alter their activities. For example, in non-attainment areas, the following programs, many of which are still undergoing refinement, are being required:
<UL>
<LI> Under the state's most recent plan to control ozone pollution, automobile owners would be required to have emissions from their vehicles tested every two years. Vehicles that do not meet emission standards would have to be repaired at the owner's expense. However, in 1995, the Texas Legislature passed a statewide moratorium on inspections to reconsider the program. Still, some sort of vehicle emission testing will likely be required in non-attainment areas.
<P><LI> Service stations are required to install equipment to control gasoline vapors at the pump and as fuel is being unloaded into storage tanks. Most stations were to comply by 1994; smaller stations that were built before 1992 and sell less than 10,000 gallons of gasoline per month are exempt. 
<P><LI> The Houston/Galveston area residents will have to use only reformulated gasoline, a cleaner-burning fuel.
<P><LI> The Houston/Galveston area must reduce the number of cars and trucks commuting to and from work through an employer trip reduction program. The program has been delayed six months by actions of the Legislature and Governor, however.
<P><LI> El Paso residents will have to use oxygenated gasoline to reduce carbon monoxide emissions.
<P><LI> Specific industries will be required to install pollution-control equipment beyond what is required under current regulations.
<P><LI> Small businesses like dry cleaners, paint shops, printers and autobody shops will have to install pollution-control equipment.
<P><LI> In El Paso, Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston/Galveston, industrial wastewater systems will be required to cover wastewater treatment areas and route the vapors through a control device.
<P><LI> All new or expanding major industries in a non-attainment area must apply for non-attainment source review permits, which are more stringent than attainment area permits, known as prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) permits.
<P><LI> The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has designated five other metropolitan areas as "near non-attainment" areas. These areas are: Austin, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Victoria, and the Tyler/Longview/Marshall area. They are called near non-attainment because they have on occasion exceeded standards, because they were once non-attainment areas but have since come into compliance, or because of their potential for future growth. In 1993, for example, both Tyler/Longview/Marshall and Corpus Christi exceeded ozone standards for a single day - not enough to cause the cities to go out of compliance, but cause for concern. The state and local officials are working on voluntary programs in these and other cities to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds.
</UL>
<P>
Because the Clean Air Act limits growth in non-attainment areas by requiring that existing companies offset any new emissions, new industries may be inclined to locate in cities without immediate pollution problems. This growth could cause an increase in emissions of VOCs and nitrogen oxides in these cities, and could cause them eventually to exceed federal air-quality standards. 
<P>
The criteria pollutants covered by the Federal Clean Air Act are not the only pollutants. Air toxics, greenhouse gases, ozone-depleting chemicals and a wide variety of indoor air particulates are also of great concern.

<A NAME="BINATION">*</A><center>
<table border=5 width="85%">
<tr><th>ACHIEVING CLEAN AIR IS A BINATIONAL PROBLEM FOR EL PASO
</TH></TR><TR><TD>
El Paso is the only city in Texas in violation of national standards for both respirable particulate matter and carbon monoxide. The city is also designated as a "serious" non-attainment area for ozone. El Paso has been in compliance with national standards for nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and, since 1986, with lead standards. 
<P>
El Paso and other cities along the Texas/Mexico border face unique pollution problems because environmental standards differ on the two sides of the border. In fact, air pollution originating in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, Mexico - which lies in a desert valley across the Rio Grande River from El Paso - may contribute as much or more to overall air pollution in El Paso than pollution originating on the U.S. side of the border. These two cities, along with Sunland Park, New Mexico, share a common airshed in a valley characterized by the Rio Grande River and surrounding moun-tain peaks. Temperature inversions in the area contribute to air pollution problems. 
<P>
A 1990 joint study by the EPA, Texas Air Control Board, El Paso City/County Health Department and Mexican authorities found that the highest concentrations of particulate matter occurred in urban Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez and in the mountain pass along the border.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#43">(43)</A> The principle sources of carbon monoxide, particulate matter and ozone in the area include motor vehicles, industries located in the airshed and open burning of domes-tic and agricultural waste. 
<P>
A problem specific to the area is the large number of vehicles waiting to enter or exit the United States from Mexico. The El Paso - Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez border crossing is one of the busiest crossings along the border. Each vehicle crossing the border, about 40 percent of which have Mexican license plates, must wait at least 10 minutes at the border while their paperwork is processed. Vehicles at idle produce higher emissions. Mexican vehicles, because they are older and often have less stringent maintenance and emission controls, tend to be higher emitters.
<P>
If the TNRCC can prove that pollution emanating from outside the United States prevents El Paso's compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for any of the criteria pollutants - ozone, carbon monoxide and particulate matter - then the city will not bump up to a severe non-attainment area if the attainment deadlines are not met. This dispensation would also keep the city from suffering federal sanctions including the loss of federal highway funds and construction grants. However, El Paso will still have to adopt stringent pollution control rules to comply with the FCAA.
<P>
For the past two years, state and local officials, environmental groups and business interests from the U.S. and Mexico have been working on the concept of an International Air Quality Management District encompassing the two cities and surrounding areas. Under one proposal, the District would coordinate monitoring and set caps on emissions within the airshed, while also allowing for flexibility to meet these standards. For example, rather than investing in expensive pollution con-trol equipment, new businesses in El Paso might offset their emissions by instead investing in a similar facility in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, or helping pave Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez streets.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#44">(44)</A>

<P>
Air toxics is a term which describes a broad group of non-criteria pollutants including NESHAP pollutants (hazardous air pollutants regulated by National Emission Standards established and enforced by the EPA), workplace pollutants, state-regulated pollutants, toxics compounds covered by the Toxics Release Inventory Program and other toxic pollutants addressed by the Federal Clean Air Act. While total emissions of these compounds are small compared to the criteria air pollutants - they are usually measured in pounds, not tons - their potential impact on human health can be great, especially for individuals living near a source of emissions or a spill release. Upon inhalation, air toxics are brought into the lungs, where some are readily absorbed into the blood stream. Some air toxics can also irritate sensitive tissues in the eyes, throat and nose. Some may cause cancer in humans. Others may cause reproductive dysfunctions, birth defects or nervous system disorders. 
<P>
The 1986 Superfund Authorization and Renewal Act requires businesses to report all releases into the air, water, or ground of more than 300 toxic chemicals and 20 toxic chemical compounds. These data are compiled into the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). Recently, the EPA added an additional 286 chemicals to the list of chemicals which must be reported by manufacturing industries.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#45">(45)</A> Texas leads the nation in air toxics releases, accounting in 1992 for about 7.5 percent of all toxic air emissions nationwide.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#46">(46)</A> However, between 60 percent and two-thirds of the nation's petrochemical capacity occurs in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#47">(47)</A>
<P>
Industrial toxics emissions are just part of total toxic air emissions. In 1991, the Texas Air Control Board estimated that these releases accounted for only 18 percent of total toxic air emissions, while mobile sources - automobiles, motorcycles, pickups, vans and trucks -  accounted for 24 percent. "Area sources" - dry cleaners, solvent and paint shops and wastewater treatment plants among others - emit up to three times the amount of toxics emitted statewide by major industries.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#48">(48)</A> Still, the contribution of total air toxic emissions of each of these categories - industrial, mobile and area sources - varies widely with location.
<P>
The EPA has had the authority to set standards for hazardous air pollutants since 1970. Because of sparse medical data, however, the EPA has faced numerous legal challenges in adopting regulatory measures. Through 1993, the list of NESHAPS - national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants- stood at seven, and included the following chemicals: asbestos, beryllium, arsenic, mercury, benzene, vinyl chloride and radionuclides. 
<P>
In 1990, the new Federal Clean Air Act directed the EPA to control industrial emissions for 189 toxic chemicals with potential effects ranging from chronic respiratory effects to cancer to reproductive dysfunctions. The EPA must designate control-technology standards for 174 types of facilities that emit one or more of the 189 listed hazardous air pollutants. Standards for 39 sources were due by November, 1994.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#49">(49)</A> In some cases, EPA will establish the specific type of technology to be used to limit releases of pollutants; in others, industry will have flexibility in determining which type of technology they use to meet emission requirements.  
<P>
For those compounds not classified as criteria pollutants or with national emission standards (NESHAPs), air toxicologists and regulators at the TNRCC have conducted site-specific reviews of predicted or actual impacts for potential adverse effects. "Effects Screening Levels" (ambient air concentration guidelines, or ESLs) are used to gauge the potential of toxics air emissions associated with expansion of an existing facility or construction of a new facility to cause adverse health or welfare effects.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#50">(50)</A> 
<P>
Screening levels are set to protect against health effects, odor nuisance, effects on vegetation or corrosive effects, and are set to protect the more sensitive members of the general public. If, during the permit review process, the TNRCC determines that proposed emissions may result in exposure of the general public outside of the facility to concentrations of air pollutants at levels above these screening levels, the Commission may either deny the permit or require pollution control equipment as a permit provision.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#51">(51)</A> 
<P>
These health-based screening levels are controversial. Since each screening level is based upon the effects of a single chemical, simultaneous exposure to several air pollutants (each of which may have a similar effect on health) may not be adequately addressed.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#52">(52)</A> The Toxicology and Risk Assessment Section at the TNRCC are aware of this potential for additive effects, but believe that the ESLs are conservative enough to protect against this effect in the vast majority of cases. In special cases, additional review is conducted as needed.
<P>
Another criticism is that ESLs do not address specifically the potential accumulation in the environment, over time, of compounds like DDTs, PCBs and metals. Although many toxics can degrade or be washed out of the environment in a short time, a few compounds are not readily degraded, and may accumulate in the tissue of lower organisms, then eventually in fish, birds and even mammals such as humans. In the review of impacts of these chemicals, this potential is considered.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#53">(53)</A> 
<P>
While Texas keeps an extensive air toxic emission inventory - how many pounds are actually emitted in the air - there is much less data on levels of toxics in the ambient air. In 1992, the TNRCC established the Community Air Toxics Monitoring Program, a network of 15 monitoring sites that will eventually expand to 50 sites.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#54">(54)</A> The 15 sites have analyzed air samples for 19 volatile organic compounds. In both 1992 and 1993, benzene, a human carcinogen, was the only compound consistently detected at levels above the effects screening levels, and was detected at eight of the 15 sites.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#55">(55)</A> 
<P>
The TNRCC determined, however, that the benzene measurements that exceeded the 24-hour ESLs would not increase the risk of short term adverse health effects. The TNRCC further concluded that, while long-term exposure to benzene at levels significantly greater than the annual ESL may increase the lifetime risk of developing leukemia or affect the formation of blood, measured levels of benzene have significantly decreased over the past 10 years.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#56">(56)</A> 
<P>
Benzene is a constituent of gasoline; it is released from cars during refueling and is a component of car exhaust. Benzene is also released during industrial refining processes and from benzene storage tanks. In Texas, the counties along the Gulf Coast have the greatest number of sources of benzene because of the large number of petrochemical companies and petroleum refineries.
<P>
Another compound - 1,2 dibromoethane - exceeded its screening levels at two sites in Houston, and at sites in El Paso and Midlothian during the monitoring period running from October 1992 through September 1993.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#57">(57)</A> It is released to the atmosphere primarily through its use as a pesticide and as a fuel additive for gasoline. The manufacture of 1,2 dibromoethane has declined in recent years because its use as a fumigant has been banned and because the decline in lead-content of gasoline has resulted in a decline in its use as a fuel additive. While 24-hour concentrations did exceed the established ESL standards at these sites, they were not high enough to result in acute health effects according to TNRCC criteria. Nonetheless, yearly screening levels were exceeded.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#58">(58)</A>
<P>
The TNRCC, partly in response to legislative and citizen concerns about potential health effects of air toxics, has initiated special purpose studies at several sites around Texas. For example, after noticing high levels of arsenic in ambient air analyses in El Paso, the state initiated a special study in 1993 near the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO). The Vilas Elementary School, about two miles southwest of the plant, was the site chosen for the study. The study showed that arsenic levels consistently exceeded both the annual and 24-hour screening levels. By comparing test results to levels measured when the ASARCO plant was shut down for a strike in 1980, the state concluded that the high arsenic levels were because of plant activity. During a permit hearing, the company agreed to reduce arsenic emissions by a factor of ten.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#59">(59)</A>

<H4>
<A NAME="GREEN">GREENHOUSE EFFECT</A>
</H4>
<P>
One reason the earth is warm enough to support life is that carbon dioxide and other gases in the upper atmosphere act as a kind of transparent umbrella, allowing sunlight to pass through, then trapping the heat below. This intricate but natural process is known as the greenhouse effect. 
<P>
With increased burning of coal, oil, and natural gas over the past century and with the destruction of much of the earth's forest cover, the greenhouse effect may be intensifying. The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, some of which is used by trees and other vegetation during photosynthesis and some of which is absorbed by the oceans. When vast amounts of carbon dioxide are being produced and less is being used by plants, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases. This accumulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (methane, ozone, nitrous oxides, and chlorofluorocarbons) in earth's atmosphere may be causing the average temperature around the globe to rise, a phenomenon referred to as "global warming."
<P>
The environmental implications of global warming are serious. Higher average temperatures could hasten melting of the polar ice caps, raising sea levels and distorting rainfall patterns. Coastal cities and plant and animal habitat could be destroyed. An alteration of climate could also reduce crop production. However, there may also be some benefits derived. 
<P>
Scientists like James Hansen, of NASA's Goddard Institute, believe that the Earth is already experiencing an enhanced greenhouse effect. For example, six of the hottest years in recorded history occurred in the last decade.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#60">(60)</A> And studies have shown a correlation between the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and a rise in global temperature.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#61">(61)</A>
<P>
There is considerable debate about the phenomenon of global warming. Critics like Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology believe while carbon dioxide accumulation may lead to warming climates, the actual impacts of warming will be mitigated by other factors. For instance, the increase in soot, sulfuric acid and particulate matter in the atmosphere, which help scatter light away from the earth, may be counteracting temperature increases that would otherwise occur from the accumulation of greenhouse gases. Still other scientists believe that temperature fluctuations are a normal occurence, attributable to such events as sun spots, and that techniques for measuring temperature are not accurate enough to permit scientists to design proper models of global temperature. Other scientists have developed climactic models which indicate a movement toward a severe cooling period. 
<P>
Overall, global temperatures have increased about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the last 130 years. But the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the World Meteorological Society have both projected that by the year 2050, the average surface temperature will increase an additional 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#62">(62)</A> The effects of these increases would be felt unevenly around the globe, with temperature changing less at the equator than at higher latitudes.
<P>
To delay or prevent global warming, world and national leaders have called for a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, to be accomplished through a shift away from the use of oil, gas and coal and toward the use of more renewable energy sources like solar power.
<P>
In Texas, climatic changes predicted as a result of global warming could profoundly alter how Texans live and work. In Dallas, for example, if IPCC predictions are true, the number of days when the temperature reaches 100 degrees F could increase from 19 to 78 per year by 2050. In central Texas, average temperatures could go up five degrees during the same period.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#63">(63)</A> Water levels would also be affected. Rainfall would decline in most areas and the hotter temperatures would increase the rate of evaporation, resulting in a reduced water supply. Coastal areas would likely face more intense rainfall, however, as clouds forming from increased evaporation of ocean waters gave rise to more violent storms. Low-level areas along the coast would be subject to more flooding from increased rainfall and rising sea levels.
<P>
Texas may, however, also derive some positive benefits from warmer annual temperatures. One of these effects is that milder winters may reduce the risk of freezes which cripple citrus crops.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#64">(64)</A> 
<P>
Although there are currently no guidelines or limits in international law relating to greenhouse gases other than CFCs, there is growing awareness that the problem must be addressed. Many of the nations that are signatories to the Montreal Protocol are currently discussing the possibility of an international "law of the atmosphere" that would establish limits on the release of several greenhouse gases<B>.</B><A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#65">(65)</A> 
<P>
With only 5 percent of the world's population, the United States produces 23.4 percent of the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels. Texas alone produces more carbon dioxide than either the United Kingdom or Canada.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#66">(66)</A> The state emitted an estimated 550 million metric tons in 1988 from all sources.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#67">(67)</A>
<P>

Texas depends heavily on fossil fuels both to power cars and to generate electricity. Texas utilities, for example, contributed 159 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 1991, or about 30 percent of all greenhouse gases emitted. Without major changes in how Texas produces its energy, these levels are expected to continue. For a full discussion of energy use and energy policy in Texas, see the section entitled "Energy."

	<LI>  Most of the sun's energy reaches the Earth.  (The ozone layer shields the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.) 
	<LI>  About 30 percent of the energy is reflected back into space. 
	<LI>  Burning of fossil fuels and deforestation increase carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Added to this are chloroflourocarbons (man-made gases used in spray cans, refrigerants and insulations) and methane (from landfills, farming and swamps).

<A NAME="STRATO">DECREASING STRATOSPHERIC OZONE</A>
</H4>
<P>
Chlorinated fluorocarbons, or CFCs is the name given to a family of chemicals developed in 1928 by DuPont under the name Freon. Today, CFCs are used for refrigeration and air conditioning, as well as in the manufacture of aerosol sprays, computer chips, and many other products. When released into the air, these chemicals eventually rise to the stratosphere where they are broken down by sunlight. This degradation process releases chlorine, which damages the layer of atmospheric ozone that absorbs most of the sun's ultraviolet-B radiation. The destructive influence of CFCs high in the atmosphere is significant: a single chlorine atom can lead to the destruction of more than 100,000 ozone molecules.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#68">(68)</A>
<P>
Destruction of the ozone layer appears to be increasing. In the spring of 1985, British scientists found a hole about the size of the continental U.S. in the ozone layer over the Antarctica. This hole has reappeared each spring when meteorological conditions facilitate the breakdown in ozone. In 1992, satellite images recorded global ozone levels 4 percent lower than normal. Meanwhile, the concentration of CFCs measured in the atmo-sphere continues to climb.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#69">(69)</A> Use of other "ozone-depleters" like halons, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and hydrochloroflourocarbons (HCFCs) has also been on the rise.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#70">(70)</A> The high levels of ultraviolet-B radiation reaching the earth as a result of ozone depletion have been shown to increase the incidence of skin cancer and cataracts in humans. This radiation also adversely affects the environment. 
<P>
Because of the danger CFCs pose to the ozone layer, the Clean Air Act requires a phase-out of the production of CFCs and halons by the year 2000. Interim substitutes, such as HCFCs, will also be eventually phased out. In Texas, major industries still release millions of pounds of ten chemicals EPA has identified as ozone-depleters. Still, most CFCs do not come from industrial sources but rather from refrigerants, automobile air conditioning and solvents in oil-based paints.

<A NAME="INDOOR">INDOOR AIR POLLUTION</A>
</H4>
<P>
The air we breathe indoors, whether at home, in our cars or at work, may represent a bigger pollution problem than outdoor air pollution. With people spending up to 90 percent of their time indoors, the quantity and severity of health problems related to indoor air quality has probably increased over the last 10 years.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#71">(71)</A> For example, in a December 1989 report, the EPA compared the risks of 20 different environmental problems and found that indoor air pollution posed the greatest health risk, though it had the least amount of federal money dedicated to it.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#72">(72)</A>
<P>
The severity of indoor air pollution is aggravated by the fact that new buildings are being built more tightly to save money spent on heating and cooling. Because these tightly sealed, more energy efficient buildings prevent the exchange of outside/inside air, they reduce the amount of fresh air in a building. At the same time, people are using more and more irritating products such as hair sprays, pesticides and cleaning detergents. The combination of a lack of ventilation and heavy use of such materials can be dangerous. In Texas, the Department of Health's Indoor Air Quality Branch is responsible for responding to indoor air-quality complaints, providing on-site investigations, educating the public about indoor air quality health problems and suggesting methods to alleviate indoor air quality problems.
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> During FY 1992, the Texas Department of Health's Indoor Air Quality Branch received over 3,000 requests for information, responded to indoor air-quality complaints from 124 schools, buildings and residences, and performed more than 257 on-site investigations, including 130 private residences. For more information, please call the Occupational Health Division at the Department of Health at 512-834-6600.

<P>
The American Lung Association has estimated that indoor air pollution costs businesses over $100 billion dollars a year because of death, sick days, direct medical costs, loss of productivity and damage to materials and equipment. The Environmental Protection Agency projects that 3,500 to 6,500 deaths a year are the result of the effects of indoor air pollutants.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#73">(73)</A> The causes of these deaths include cancer and coronary heart disease caused by exposure to radon, paints, solvents and second-hand tobacco smoke. 
<P>
Indoor air pollution is suspected to be one of the leading causes of health problems largely because of seven pollutants: environmental tobacco smoke, volatile organic compounds, radon, microorganisms, pesticides, asbestos and lead. In 1989, EPA Administrator William K. Reilly asked an independent team of scientists known as the Science Advisory Board to assess and compare different environmental risks using recent scientific data. The group found that indoor air quality problems from environmental (second-hand) tobacco smoke, radon and six volatile organic compounds often found indoors in solvents, paints and gasoline products represented one of four problems posing "relatively high human health risks."<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#74">(74)</A>
<P>
Radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas, is responsible for an estimated 10 percent of lung cancer deaths. This colorless, odorless gas occurs everywhere at low levels, but it becomes a concern when it is trapped in buildings with little ventilation. Radon gas may enter homes built on soils or rocks containing high levels of uranium, which is the most common source of the gas, or through cracks or other openings in basements or ground floors. Studies by the EPA indicate that as many as 10 percent of U.S. homes may have elevated radon levels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#75">(75)</A> A 1992 study by the TDH monitored indoor air for radon in about 2,700 homes across Texas. The TDH found four areas with a high potential for radon: the West Texas Panhandle Region; the Big Bend area; the Llano Uplift area; and inland from the coastal bend in South Texas.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#76">(76)</A>
<P>
Microorganisms - bacteria, viruses and fungi - can cause serious illnesses such as Legionnaire's Disease, asthma, influenza and other infectious diseases.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#77">(77)</A> These microorganisms can grow in humid buildings, as well as in bedding or the litter of household pets, and without proper ventilation, can easily infect occupants. More subtle health effects, commonly known as "sick building syndrome," include headaches, irritation of eyes, nose and respiratory tract, loss of memory, fatigue and drowsiness. An EPA survey of office workers across the nation found that 19 percent of respondents sometimes had difficulty performing work because of poor indoor air quality.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#78">(78)</A>
<P>
Indoor exposure to pesticides, asbestos and lead all affect human health, particularly the health of young children. The practice of sanding or open-flame burning of lead-based paints, which were in common use before 1978, emits compounds that can impair mental and physical development in both fetuses and young children. Using 1990 census data, the EPA determined that 3.5 million homes in Texas contain some lead-based paint. Based upon these figures, the EPA estimates that 1,949,696 children six years old or under have the potential to be exposed to lead poisoning.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#79">(79)</A> 
<P>
Pesticides in the home or office can irritate eyes, nose and throat and may damage the central nervous system or may even lead to an increased risk of cancer. According to an EPA survey, nine out of ten U.S. households have used pesticides.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#80">(80)</A> Chlordane, dieldrin and other chemicals used to kill termites have been banned or their indoor use severely restricted in part because they remain active for such long periods. Also, several types of asbestos products, made from a mineral fiber used as an insulator and fire-retardant, have been banned by the EPA because they can cause chest and lung cancer as well as a condition known as asbestosis, an irreversible lung scarring which can be fatal.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#81">(81)</A> Elevated concentrations of asbestos can occur indoors when asbestos-containing materials are disturbed by remodeling or demolition activities.
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">  An EPA study indicates that nearly 90 percent of most people's exposure to pesticides occurs indoors.

Today's automobile produces approximately 90<B> </B>percent less pollution than cars built in the 1960s.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#82">(82)</A> Leaded gasoline has been phased out, and government-mandated manufacturing improvements, like the catalytic converter and the fuel injector, have significantly reduced tailpipe emissions. However, the benefits of these improvements have been largely offset by several factors: a rapid expansion in the number of cars on the roads, an increase in the number of miles driven each day and changes in the composition of gasoline. (As lead has been phased out, refineries have made up for the loss in octane with changes in the gasoline formula that make auto fuel more likely to release smog-forming VOCs into the air.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#83">(83)</A>) As a result, motor vehicle use still contributes significantly to air pollution, accounting for a quarter of the CFCs in the air, 70 percent of the carbon monoxide and more than a third of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides emitted in the United States.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#84">(84)</A> 
<P>
In Texas, vehicles also account for 24 percent of all air toxics, and most of the air-borne cancer-causing compounds like butadiene and benzene.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#85">(85)</A> When toxic emissions from service stations, auto body shops and the gasoline refinery and tire manufacturing industries are added in, motor vehicles' contribution to toxic emissions in Texas climbs to 45 percent.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#86">(86)</A>
<P>
There are three obvious ways to reduce pollution from cars: produce lower-emission vehicles, reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled and convert vehicles to cleaner, alternative fuels like natural gas, propane and electricity. 
<P>
The Federal Clean Air Act requires states to develop a plan to bring non-attainment areas into compliance with national air quality standards. These plans must include a mobile sources component. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has submitted a plan to the Environmental Protection Agency for the state's four ozone non-attainment areas: El Paso, Houston/Galveston/Brazoria, Dallas/Fort Worth and Beaumont/Port Arthur.

<tr><th>NEW HIGHWAY VEHICLE PROGRAMS MANDATED BY CLEAN AIR ACT OF 1990 - INCLUDED IN TEXAS' STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.
</TH></TR><TR><TD>
REFORMULATED FUEL: Houston/Galveston/Brazoria. Use fuels that are 15 percent cleaner (1995). Use fuels that are 25 percent cleaner (2000). Fuel distributors must sell gasoline that has been reformulated to produce lower hydrocarbon emissions, increasing fuel costs by 3 to 5 cents per gallon in affected areas.
<P>
OXYGENATED FUEL: El Paso. Use fuels with 2.7 percent oxygen content during "high CO" season (1992). Gasoline sold between October 1 and March 31 must have a minimum oxygen content of 2.7 percent. El Paso's program has reduced carbon monoxide emissions by 17 percent with minimal effect on fuel prices.
<P>
TEXAS ALTERNATIVE FUEL FLEET PROGRAM: Non-attainment areas. A percentage of new vehicles in commercial fleets must meet clean-fueled vehicle standards (30 percent by 1998, 50 percent-1999, 70 percent-2000). Applies to private/commercial and government fleets with 15 or more vehicles. Alternative fuels may include CNG, LNG, ethanol, methanol or electric. Legislation has expanded this to any fuel that can be used to meet the standards, including reformulated fuels.
<P>
VEHICLE INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE: Non-attainment areas. High-tech emissions testing, evaporative system checks (General public, 1995). Applies to all gasoline powered vehicles registered or operating in the non-attainment areas. Odd model year vehicles test in odd years, even model in even years. Legislation allowing the Governor to negotiate greater consumer convenience and flexibility has recently passed.
<P>
EMPLOYER TRIP REDUCTION: Houston. Employers must adopt plans to reduce work-related trips by 25 percent (Submit plans, 1994; compliance, 1996) Program modifications are being considered to provide market-based incentives and minimize employer compliance liability.

<A NAME="TIGHT"><H4>TIGHTER TAILPIPE EMISSION STANDARDS 
</A></H4><P>
Cutting emissions from auto tailpipes may be the most direct method to reduce air pollution. The Pechan Study, sponsored by the Northeastern States for Coordinated Air Use Management, concluded that cutting emissions from mobile sources is more economical than reducing emissions from industry. Of course this relationship does not hold for all industries and all areas. But in areas of Texas where mobile sources contribute significantly more VOCs and nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere than industries do, reducing vehicle emissions may be the most economical way to fight urban pollution.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#87">(87)</A>
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">  According to a recent study, cutting smog-forming pollution from vehicles costs about $500 per ton through a vehicle-emissions program; reducing the same amount of pollution in major industries costs from $2,000 to $10,000 per ton, according to the EPA. 
	<P><I>Source: Sam Howe Verhovek, "Texas Joins Parade of States Colliding with Clean Air Act," </I>The New York Times<I>, February 14, 1995.</I>
</UL>

<P>
Under the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act, pollution-control equipment (fuel injectors and catalytic converters) on all 1994 cars must last for 100,000 miles, rather than the 50,000 miles required by previous Federal Clean Air Acts. In addition, engines for diesel trucks must be designed to reduce particulate releases by 90 percent. Buses will have to make similar reductions. Finally, the Act requires the automobile industry to produce vehicles that emit 35 to 50 percent less VOCs, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide than current vehicles.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#88">(88)</A> At least 500,000 of these Low Emission Vehicles (LEVs) must be manufactured for sale in California by 1999.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#89">(89)</A> New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Maine are considering requiring the sale of these vehicles to meet ozone standards. 
<P>
New regulations adopted by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission require that, beginning September 1998, an increasing percentage of all vehicles bought or leased by all mass transit and all other fleets with 15 or more vehicles must meet or exceed the LEV tailpipe emissions standards. By 2002, 90 percent of all new vehicle purchases must meet these standards. The program affects all private and public fleets in three non-attainment areas: El Paso, Houston/Galveston/Brazoria and Beaumont/Port Arthur. To meet these standards, vehicles can either use alternative fuels such as propane, natural gas, ethanol, methanol, or electricity, reformulated gasoline or diesel fuels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#90">(90)</A>

An alternative measure that would directly reduce vehicle emissions would be to reduce the number of vehicles driven and miles traveled. In the 1980s, urban traffic grew more than roadway capacity throughout the country, leading to congested traffic. The traditional response to traffic congestion has been to build more highways. But this expansion inevitably provides an incentive for more people to drive cars and encourages increases in vehicle miles traveled. 
<P>
<UL>

<P>
Both the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act and the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) have emphasized transportation planning that encourages car-pooling and the use of public transportation. ISTEA, if fully funded, will funnel an additional $385 million in federal funds to Texas each year between 1992 and 1997. Moreover, the ISTEA-required planning process relies heavily on local Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to help distribute these funds. Each MPO must certify that its use of federal funds will result in fewer emissions or better air quality.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#91">(91)</A> Still, the Texas Department of Transportation estimates that only 5 percent of federal, state and local highway funds is being specifically earmarked to mitigate congestion and improve air quality. 
<P>
Texas has more motor vehicles than any state except for California, and in Texas, as in the nation as a whole, the number of cars driven and miles traveled have grown exponentially in recent decades.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#92">(92)</A> With more than 18 million cars registered to Texas drivers, traffic congestion has become a problem in cities all over Texas. Congestion causes travel delays and wastes fuel. It also decreases fuel efficiency and increases dangerous vehicle emissions. In Houston, traffic grew by 75 percent between 1970 and 1980. In 1990, Houston was among the 10 most congested cities in the U.S.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#93">(93)</A> The TNRCC notes that increased traffic speeds monitored in recent years suggests congestion improvements.

The Federal Clean Air Act mandates an Employer Trip Reduction (ETR) Program in severe and extreme non-attainment areas. This program requires employers with more than 100 employees at a worksite to offer those employees incentives to stop driving to and from work alone. In Houston, total miles driven in commuting trips must be reduced and passenger occupancy increased by 25 percent through ETR efforts. The Legislature recently approved a six-month delay in the program to help make it more flexible.

<A NAME="PUSHING">PUSHING FOR ALTERNATIVE FUELS
</A></H4>
<P>
A third way to reduce pollution from cars is to change to cleaner-burning fuels. Recognizing Texas' vast potential as an "alternative energy" state, the Texas Legislature created its own "plan" for alternative fuels by passing legislation in 1989.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#94">(94)</A> The legislation requires state agencies, school districts with more than 50 buses and all mass transit authorities to purchase only those new vehicles capable of running on alternative fuels. By September 1, 1994, state agencies and mass transit authorities must have converted 30 percent of their fleets to alternative fuel. By 1996, 50 percent must be converted and by 1998, 90 percent. School districts have a slightly more flexible schedule: by September 1, 1997, 50 percent of their buses must be converted and 90 percent must be using an approved alternative fuel by 2001. Private fleets of more than 15 vehicles in Houston/Galveston/Brazoria, El Paso and Beaumont/Port Arthur are subject to these same requirements as part of the state's plan to meet the Clean Air Act. By 1998, 30 percent of the vehicles are required to use alternative fuels. 
<P>
The alternative fuels currently approved for use in Texas by the TNRCC are: natural gas, liquid petroleum gas (propane), methanol, ethanol and electricity. Industry groups and some legislators have proposed including both low-sulfur diesel and reformulated gasoline as alternative fuels. Under a revised plan not yet approved by the EPA, the TNRCC will allow use of these fuels for local governments, private fleets and smaller school districts providing they meet tough emission standards.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#95">(95)</A> The certification of alternative-fueled vehicles to specific low emission vehicle standards is necessary to quantify emission reductions. 
<P>
Alternative fuels have two advantages over conventional fuels: price and cleanliness. One disadvantage is that alternative-fuel vehicles cannot travel as far without refueling. For example, a gasoline-fueled vehicle able to travel 100 miles would only travel 85 miles on propane and 31 miles on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) because the alternative fuels have lower energy content.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#96">(96)</A> However, improvements in automobile manufacturing technologies are increasing gas mileage for propane, methanol and natural gas vehicles.
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">  A test conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency on a propane-fueled car revealed that net carbon monoxide emissions were 93 percent less, hydrocarbons 73 percent less and nitrogen oxides 53 percent less than federal emission standards for gasoline. 
	<P><I> Source: Information provided by Alternative Fuels Division, Texas Railroad Commission, Alternative Fuels Research and Education Division.</I>

</UL>
<P>
<P>
New technology alternative-fueled vehicles can be substantially cleaner than today's gasoline-powered vehicles. Compressed natural gas (CNG)-powered vehicles are cleaner because they use a closed-loop system - there is no evaporation or escape of uncombusted gas before it reaches the tailpipe. A diesel-fueled bus emits as much particulate matter as 500 natural gasoline-powered automobiles.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#97">(97)</A>
<P>
Propane - or Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) - is another cleaner burning alternative fuel. Like CNG, the fuel system in a propane-powered vehicle is a closed-loop system, meaning there are no evaporative emissions. In addition, propane-powered vehicles emit even less nitrogen oxides than vehicles using natural gas. Another significant advantage of both CNG and propane use is that both fuels eliminate the need for underground storage tanks. Texas has had nearly 15,000 reported cases of leaks from petroleum underground storage tanks - leaks that often contaminate soil and water.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#98">(98)</A>
<P>
Several companies in Texas have been promoting electric vehicle (EV) technology. Electrosource, an Austin-based company, is developing a lead-acid electric battery that is expected to last 50,000 miles. The battery would also allow cars to travel between 100 and 150 miles before recharging.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#99">(99)</A> The Chrysler Corporation plans to test the new electric battery on a fleet of mini-vans. Still, the limited number of miles these vehicles can travel before recharging and the time needed to recharge are obstacles to their widespread acceptance.
<P>
The conversion of vehicles to alternative fuels might be beneficial to the Texas economy, which sits atop 27.5 percent of known natural gas reserves in the continental U.S.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#100">(100)</A> Initially viewed by the oil industry as a costly waste product, natural gas has now become an important source of energy in Texas and the world. Propane is the most widely used alternative fuel in Texas, the U.S. and the world, and Texas produces more propane than any other state. More than 60 percent of propane comes from natural gas production; the remainder is derived from crude oil during the refining process. Texas oil and natural gas refineries produced about 5.6 billion gallons of propane in 1992.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#101">(101)</A> 
<P>
Most propane is used as a raw material in the production process at petrochemical plants; however, about 10 percent is used for transportation fuel. Farmers and ranchers in Texas have long relied on propane to fuel agricultural vehicles and rural Texans have used it for heating and cooking for some 50 years.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#102">(102)</A>
<P>
At present, the major obstacles to the use of alternative fuels is the lack of an infrastructure for distributing them to consumers, and a range limitation considering the distances between towns in West Texas and the Panhandle. Unlike regular gasoline or diesel fuels, there is not a CNG refueling station on every corner. As of April 1994, Texas had 73 filling stations for natural gas refueling and about 1,200 propane refueling stations.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#103">(103)</A> 
<P>
Another obstacle to the use of alternative fuels is the cost of converting old vehicles to run on an alternative fuel. The price tag for converting an average car to propane, which includes replacement of the fuel system and installation of new electronics, is about $2,000.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#104">(104)</A> Ford officials have estimated that natural gas vehicles currently cost $3,500 to $6,000 more to manufacture than conventional vehicles. In 1983, the Garland Independent School District invested $241,000 to convert 65 school buses and 12 support vehicles to natural gas and to install refueling facilities. This expenditure aver-aged out to about $3,500 per vehicle. In general, it is cheaper to convert a vehicle to propane than to natural gas. Despite these conversions costs, converting vehicles may be economical for some fleets in the long run because propane and natural gas are cheaper than gasoline and because maintenance costs are generally lower over a 3- to 5-year period. The city of Garland saved more than $100,000 in the first two years alone in fuel and maintenance costs.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#105">(105)</A>
<P>

	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">  By 2002, it is estimated that about one million vehicles in Texas could be running on propane or natural gas.

</UL>
<P>
Since alternative fuels legislation went into effect in 1991, about 80 percent of the vehicles that have converted to alternative fuels have converted to propane.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#106">(106)</A> As of July, 1994, there were 30,453 alternative fuel vehicles registered with the Comptroller's Motor Fuel Tax Section. This total does not include several thousand alternative-fueled vehicles operated by counties and school districts, which are not taxed.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#107">(107)</A> At present, 39 school districts are using propane to fuel their vehicles.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#108">(108)</A>

In 1993, 100 facilities in Texas emitted more than 18,000 tons of particulate matter, 924,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, 746,000 tons of nitrogen oxides, 169,000 tons of VOCs, and 455,000 tons of carbon monoxide into the atmosphere.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#109">(109)</A> Together, these 100 facilities produced more criteria pollutants than the total produced by the remaining 5,900 facilities reporting to the state's "Emissions Inventory."<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#110">(110)</A> In 1990, the major industries in Texas also released more air toxics than any other state. By 1992, Louisiana had the highest amount of total toxic releases, but Texas had the highest amount of toxic air releases, totaling 157.5 million pounds of some 300 chemicals.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#111">(111)</A> However, between 1987 and 1993, total releases of air toxics in Texas declined by 40 percent, from 236.8 to 141.9 million pounds.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#112">(112)</A>
<P>
For these reasons -  the emission of criteria air pollutants and toxics - these industrial facilities, which the Federal Clean Air Act calls "major stationary sources," are often the focus of state and citizen efforts to reduce air pollution. In fact, major industry bears the administrative burden of obtaining permits and, particularly in the non-attainment areas, must reduce emissions significantly. This section takes a look at three categories of major-stationary-source air pollution: manufacturing, combustion and mechanical facilities. 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">  Despite the large amount of effort spent by the state in issuing permits, violations of permits and state air quality regulations are fairly common. In the ten year period between September 1982 and August 1992, there were more than 23,000 violations issued by the Texas Air Control Board. Over this period, around 3,400 violations were for failure to obtain a permit prior to construction or operation of a facility.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#113">(113)</A> Other common violations included nuisance violations, violating the conditions of a permit, creating a traffic hazard, failing to report upset air emissions and violating federal toxics emission standards. Most of these toxic emission standard violations were violations of the asbestos demolition or renovation standards which did not result in significant air emissions.

<A NAME="PERMIT">*</A><center>
<table border=5 width="85%">
<tr><th>WHO MUST OBTAIN A PERMIT IN TEXAS?</TH></TR><TR><TD>
One way the state of Texas regulates air emissions is through a permitting process. Under the Texas Clean Air Act of 1971, most new or expanding industries that will emit air contaminants must obtain a permit from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission before any construction is begun. Such permits require that the facility install "best available control technology." Some facilities are exempt from the pre-construction permit requirement if they meet conditions set out in the state's "standard exemption" list, which covers small businesses like dry cleaners, auto body shops and paint shops.
<P>
As of April 1994, Texas had issued 20,928 state permits in both attainment and non-attainment areas. Some 14,000 are still active.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#114">(114)</A> This construction permitting process is divided into non-attainment review for sources located in non-attainment areas and prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) review in attainment areas. Permits in non-attainment areas are generally more stringent. It is important to note that air pollution sources which were operating before 1972 and have not expanded are not required to have a state permit; these are known as "grandfathered" facilities. 
<P>
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act created a new category of permits: operating permits. These permits are required of all major stationary sources which emit air pollutants. The purpose of federal operating permits is to codify all applicable requirements at a site and provide an enforcement and compliance tool. For example, a petroleum refinery operation may have 100 to 200 different rules, regulations, permits and variances governing the operation of their facility. A Title V permit would codify them all. Thus, construction permits would be incorporated into an operating permit. The TNRCC projects that there will be 8,100 federal operating permits issued at some 3,000 sites in Texas during the five years after the Texas program receives EPA approval.

<A NAME="MANU">MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas' major industries are concentrated along the Gulf Coast and in major metropolitan areas like Dallas-Fort Worth, El Paso, Midland-Odessa, San Antonio and Austin. The amount and type of pollution varies widely by region. For example, Corpus Christi's major industries - oil and gas refineries, pipelines, and chemical companies - contribute an estimated 41 percent of total volatile organic compounds and 62 percent of nitrogen oxides emitted in the Corpus Christi area every day. In Austin, major industries - mainly electronics manufacturers - only contribute 1 percent of the area's total VOC emissions and 14 percent of nitrogen oxides emissions.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#115">(115)</A> Not surprisingly, much of the concern over industrial air pollution has been along the Gulf Coast.
<P>
Toxic air emissions from these industries are a major concern of citizen groups around the state. Federal law requires manufacturing industries with more than nine employees to submit data on releases of more than 300 toxic chemicals and 20 chemical compounds. Harris, Jefferson and Galveston counties are among the top ten emitters of toxics per year in the country.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#116">(116)</A> 
<P>
Many of these toxics have been linked to both cancer and birth defects. In 1992, the chemicals known to cause, or suspected of causing birth defects - categorized as either developmental toxins or heritable mutagens by the EPA - which were released into the environment in the greatest amount included toluene, xylene, methyl ketone and trichloroethylene. Most of these releases were through the air.
<P>
There are, at present, no state or federal regulations specifying acceptable ambient concentrations for air toxics, as there are for the criteria pollutants. For example, only one of the top 15 toxic chemicals released in Texas, benzene, has been the subject of a national air quality standard. By comparison, five of these 15 toxic chemicals have maximum contaminent level standards established under the Safe Drinking Water Act.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#117">(117)</A> However, the air permitting requirement that new permitted facilities use best available control technology (BACT) limits toxic emissions considerably. Also, the 1990 Clean Air Act will impose new standards on industries identified as sources of 189 major toxic compounds. In addition, the TNRCC has developed a system to evaluate concentrations of more than 1,500 chemicals, including the top 15 toxic chemicals, emitted by permitted facilities. Guideline concentrations called ESLs, previously described, are used to evaluate not only proposed emissions but also ambient air monitoring data. 
<P>
Toxic air emissions reported to both the state's Emissions Inventory as well as under the Toxics Release Inventory Program do not include "upset" emissions. Defined as accidental, unplanned air pollution releases, thousands of upsets a year contribute pollutants to the state's atmosphere. Under state regulations, companies are required to report their upsets to the TNRCC. But the information in these reports is sketchy: a 1992 Sierra Club survey of upset emissions in nine Texas counties revealed that companies do not always report or even know in some cases how much or what type of chemical was emitted.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#118">(118)</A> According to this study, of 8,857 upset reports in 1991, 80 percent did not list the quantity of compound released, and 38 percent did not report the type of chemical released.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#119">(119)</A> Such accidents and failure or inability to report accurate upset emissions make it extremely difficult to assess the full impact of industrial toxic emissions on public health. In addition, because the state does not set levels or limits on upset emissions - by definition they are unplanned events - the data these reports do contain are not used to help set emission limits.

<P>
A second category of major stationary sources is made up of facilities that burn material for energy, waste disposal or both. Utilities, waste incinerators, industrial boilers and cement kiln facilities are the major examples. Because these facilities burn materials at very high temperatures, they emit chemicals and gases that sometimes result in dangerous chemical reactions. For example, sulfur dioxide is one of the principal compounds emitted from electric utilities. When hot, a small portion of sulfur dioxide emissions can combine with oxygen to form sulfates, which in turn can combine with water particles to form sulfuric acid. This acid falls to the earth as acid rain.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#120">(120)</A> Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, both of which contribute to the formation of acid rain, and carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, are the major pollutants resulting from combustion. Heavy metals are also emitted by some combustion facilities. Coal-burning facilities can emit mercury and cadmium. Cement kilns and incinerators for hazardous waste and municipal waste can all emit chromium, manganese and lead. 
<P>
Texas has 27 major electric utilities operating 312 generating stations.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#121">(121)</A> About half of the state's electricity is derived from coal, about 40 percent comes from natural gas, and the remainder comes from hydroelectric power, nuclear power and renewable energy sources.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#122">(122)</A> Electric utilities that use coal as their combustible material pump millions more tons of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere than do those using natural gas or a combination of petroleum and natural gas.
<P>
In 1990, the generation of electric power produced 35 percent of all the carbon dioxide and 66 percent of all the sulfur dioxide emitted in the state.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#123">(123)</A> In fact, the four facilities in Texas which released the largest volume of criteria pollutants are all coal-fired electric power plants.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#124">(124)</A> Emissions from power plants contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain. 
<P>
Under the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act, in order to combat acid rain formation, sulfur dioxide emissions must be reduced by 10 million tons below 1980 levels and nitrogen oxide emissions must be cut by 2 million tons by the year 2000. In a first phase, the nation's largest 110 utilities (none of them located in Texas) must achieve the greatest share of sulfur dioxide reduction by the end of 1995. In a second phase, all other major utilities, including those in Texas, must reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. The Clean Air Act also caps the amount of sulfur dioxide utilities can emit in 2000, and places controls on nitrogen oxide emissions as well. Major utilities in Texas will soon be required to continuously monitor and report their emissions and, like major industries, will also be required to obtain a federal operating permit.
<P>
Waste incinerators are another source of combustion-generated air pollutants. Both municipalities and industries sometimes incinerate a variety of waste as a means to reduce their volume and to generate energy. Public opposition to such facilities expressed at permit hearings has raised awareness about the air pollution that can result from these facilities, particularly hazardous waste incinerators, which burn waste that are defined as hazardous because they are toxic, flammable, corrosive and/or reactive. There are currently 32 permitted hazardous waste incinerators in Texas. Harris County, with 13 facilities, has more hazardous waste facili-ties than any other county in the United States. Jefferson County, with five, is among the top ten.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#125">(125)</A> These facilities are operated by large corporations, chiefly to dispose of their own waste. Three of the facilities presently operating in Texas are commercial waste incinerators, accepting liquid waste from both in-state and out-of-state generators.
<P>
Cement plants are combustion facilities on a smaller scale. Some burn hazardous waste to fire their kilns. In 1991, citizen groups in Midlothian, near Dallas, expressed concerns about health effects from the burning of hazardous waste in cement kilns and the dumping of cement-kiln ash in quarries. Two of the three cement kiln plants in the Midlothian area were burning waste-derived fuels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#126">(126)</A> A third had previously burned tires to generate energy and was seeking a permit to continue burning them. Responding to citizen concerns, the Texas Air Control Board monitored community air for particulate matter, metals, sulfur compounds, air toxics and other compounds. Monitors were located downwind of the major facilities in the area. Tests conducted over a two-year period indicated that no adverse health effects are expected to result from exposure to the monitored levels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#127">(127)</A>

Industries that rely on mechanical processes include: metal smelters, grain elevators, foundries, steel manufacturers, wood processors, cotton gins, asphalt batching operations, concrete and cement batching operations, paper mills, sand blasting operations and oil and gas rigs. These industries are another major category of stationary sources that can pollute the air. Cotton gins, for example, may lead to heavy emissions of particulate matter. In 1990, air sampled around a cotton gin in the Lower Rio Grande Valley showed respirable particulate matter was being emitted in high levels, although not in violation of standards applicable to agricultural sources.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#128">(128)</A> Lead smelters are of particular concern to citizens living near them and to environ- mental groups. As an air pollutant, lead is emitted in particles so small that 50 percent might remain in the lungs if breathed by humans.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#129">(129)</A> However, tests conducted by the Texas Air Control Board in response to citizen complaints found that levels of lead in the ambient air near the smelters were below national air quality standards.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#130">(130)</A> Any lead smelters built after 1987 must be at least 3,000 feet from the nearest residence.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#131">(131)</A>

<A NAME="AREA"><H4>AREA SOURCES</A>
</H4>

"Area sources" are small, stationary sources that usually do not emit large amounts of criteria pollutants or toxics. Most of these sources will not require a federal operating permit at this time. However, the EPA will eventually require all such area sources to obtain a federal operating permit. Important area sources include dry cleaners, printers, machine shops, service stations, wastewater treatment plants, auto painting, repair shops and consumers who use household consumer items. While these "small" businesses and consumer activities individually do not contribute large amounts of pollution to the atmosphere, taken collectively they emit more of some types of pollutants than do some individual large industries. For example, area sources account for 58 percent of all toxic emissions in Texas, or about three times as much as large industries combined, although emissions do not occur in the concentrations they do with major industries.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#132">(132)</A> In many cities in Texas, area sources contribute more VOCs to smog formation than do major stationary sources.
<P>
For these reasons, the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act broadened the scope of federal regulation to include areas sources. The Federal Clean Air Act has had an immediate impact on small busi-ness owners.

<P>
Even with the increased regulations, most small businesses will not be required to get a state permit. Instead, new businesses will simply have to meet the provisions of the state's standard exemption list and any general permit developed as part of the federal operating permit program. The standard exemption specifies requirements or conditions, including installation of pollution control equipment, that will allow a business to comply with air-quality laws without going through the costly permit process. In some cases, such as cement plants and asphalt plants, a standard exemption must be applied for and issued by the state. In other cases, the exemption can just be claimed by a business, which must then be prepared, if asked, to demonstrate its conformity with the conditions of the exemption.

<tr><th>HOW DOES THE FCAA IMPACT SMALL BUSINESS?
</TH></TR><TR><TD>The Federal Clean Air Act is likely to impact more than 55,000 businesses in Texas with fewer than 100 employees. Over the next five to seven years, the Environmental Protection Agency will be developing specific rules for small businesses to reduce their generation of toxic waste, their use of ozone-depleting chemicals and, in non-attainment areas, their emissions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. While these regulations are still being formulated, the EPA has pinpointed 23 industries it is most likely to regulate in the next five years.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#133">(133)</A> 
<P>
The state estimated costs for the approximately 20,593 small businesses most likely to be affected by the Federal Clean Air Act -  and for which reliable cost data was available - to be more than $1 billion, most of it for capital equipment, to comply with Federal Clean Air Act regulations over the next five years.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#134">(134)</A> In the four non-attainment areas alone, the cost to businesses for obtaining a federal operating permit and installing pollution control equipment is expected to total $505 million. All existing sources, regardless of location, that emit more than 10 tons per year of any of the 189 toxic pollutants or 25 tons per year of any combination of these 189 chemicals for which the EPA is developing rules must install control technology which is at least equivalent to the average of the top 12 percent for that industry. New sources must install the best proven technology for that industry.

<A NAME="AGRI">SPECIAL CASE: AGRICULTURE</A>
</H4>
<P>
While much of the concern about air pollution is focused on industrial and urban sources, people living in rural areas can also face nuisance odors and toxic air pollution. Air-borne pesticides are a concern in some rural areas. A recent study estimated that only 10 to 15 percent of pesticides sprayed from crop dusters reach their intended source. The remaining 85 to 90 percent can drift up to 20 miles.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#135">(135)</A> (For a full discussion of pesticides use and their health effects in Texas, see the section entitled Pesticides).
<P>
Other agricultural activities that can result in emissions of air contaminants such as odors and particulate matter include cotton gins, cotton seed oil mills, hide tanning, seed cleaning, sugar mills, sugar cane and crop residue burning, feed-mills, smokehouses and concentrated animal feeding operations or CAFOs. CAFOs are areas in which animals such as poultry, hogs or cows are concentrated in a relatively small area for egg-laying, stabling, sleeping, milking or feeding purposes. Sometimes, animal waste from these operations is collected in ponds, which can release both odors and methane gas (one of the greenhouse gases). Other animal waste is placed in manure mounds or applied as fertilizer to the land, which also can lead to odor nuisances. CAFOs and other agricultural activities are more likely to contribute air pollutants such as particulate matter to the atmosphere during hot, dry weather. For example, feedlot dust can result when cattle activity increases around dusk. Odor problems, on the other hand, usually occur following significant precipitation.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#136">(136)</A>

<P>
Large CAFOs are typically required to obtain air permits, while smaller CAFOs are usually exempt from the permitting process. Regardless of size, all CAFOs must be operated in a manner that does not result in either dust or nuisance odor problems. While quantitative measurement standards for odors have not been developed, odors from CAFOs in rural areas are a controversial issue.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#137">(137)</A> Numerous odor and dust complaints have been filed with the field offices of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission over the years. If the TNRCC confirms an odor or dust problem either in response to a citizen complaint or as a result of investigation it can issue a notice of violation. If the problem is not corrected after the notice of violation, the state can begin formal enforcement action, which may include administrative fines. 
<P>
However, the perception and reaction to an odor can be highly subjective, and different field offices have interpreted the authority to issue notices of violation differently. Because of recent court cases concerning the regulation of CAFOs and because of the complexities often surrounding alleged nuisance conditions associated with these types of operations, new policies are being developed to assure consistency in the TNRCC's regulatory process.

<A NAME="OIL"><H4>OIL </H4></A>
<P>
Texas has been producing oil for more than 110 years. Ever since the first wells in Brown County began producing oil for medicinal purposes and lubrication, oil has been a precious commodity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#23">(23)</A> 
<P>
More than a quarter of all the known oil deposits in the U.S. are in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#24">(24)</A> Yet, less than a third of the 190 billion barrels of oil beneath Texas have been produced. Some 129 billion barrels of oil remain, but much of that oils lies deep beneath the surface, making production difficult and expensive.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#25">(25)</A> 
<P>
Texas has the largest share of crude oil reserves in the nation. And the state's oil has provided a reliable source of tax revenue. Since 1930, Texas has collected more than $17 trillion in oil taxes.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#26">(26)</A> The state's oil reserves have also spawned a vast refining and petrochemical industry; two-thirds of America's petrochemical production occurs in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#27">(27)</A> 
<P>
Twenty-three percent of all the oil produced in the U.S. comes from Texas fields.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#28">(28)</A> Much of the oil produced in Texas comes from older wells with declining production. These so-called "stripper" wells produce 10 barrels of oil or less per day. But they are critically important to the state's economy because they are so numerous. In 1992, 70 percent of the 192,292 oil wells in Texas were stripper wells.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#29">(29)</A> Because stripper wells produce little oil and cost more to operate than other wells, producers and regulators have argued that tax incentives are needed to keep these wells in operation. The average daily production per Texas oil well is fewer than nine barrels. By contrast, the average oil well in Saudi Arabia produces about 6,000 barrels per day.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#30">(30)</A> 
<P>
Oil production in the state peaked in 1972 at 3.4 million barrels per day. Twenty years later, production had fallen by more than half, to 1.68 million barrels per day. This drop in production has forced the country to rely more on imported oil. 
<P>
Ever since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries shocked the world in the late 1970s by raising prices, Americans have worried about the consequences of relying on imported oil. However, this concern has faded as oil prices have fallen. At present, half of all the oil consumed in the U.S. is imported.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#31">(31)</A> By the year 2010, the U.S. could be importing 70 percent of its oil.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#32">(32)</A> This increasing reliance on imported oil could have dire consequences for America. As demonstrated by the Persian Gulf War, protecting foreign oil supplies in the Mideast and elsewhere is a costly undertaking and success is not guaranteed. Texas oil producers have long argued that stimulating the domestic oil business would have lasting benefits for the domestic economy. They advocate tax incentives to encourage oil producers to drill new wells and bring marginal wells back into production. 
<P>
Texas oil producers face increased costs of environmental compliance. The American Petroleum Institute estimates that the oil industry will be spending $20 billion per year on environmental compliance by the year 2000, an increase of 250 percent over 1992.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#33">(33)</A> Environmental costs and declining domestic oil reserves have forced American oil producers and multi-national oil companies to go overseas to develop new sources of petroleum. In 1985, the major oil companies spent 37 percent of their exploration dollars outside of the U.S. By 1991, that figure had nearly doubled.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#34">(34)</A> 
<P>
Beyond use of oil as fuel, oil exploration and production itself can have serious potential environmental consequences. For example, the Railroad Commission of Texas must deal with thousands of abandoned oil wells. Unplugged and abandoned oil wells can cause serious groundwater contamination problems, particularly in areas with naturally occurring saline groundwater. Unplugged or improperly plugged wells are vertical pipelines that can allow deep brine water reservoirs to contaminate shallow fresh water aquifers. And in many areas around the state, rural residents have been forced to abandon their water wells due to salt water contamination caused by abandoned oil wells or unlined saltwater disposal pits.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#35">(35)</A> By plugging wells as required by Railroad Commission of Texas regulations, oil producers can prevent the migration of saline water from deep aquifers into shallow fresh water aquifers. 
<P>
Some surface water supplies are also threatened by unplugged wells. Two studies by the Lower Colorado River Authority found that saltwater from unplugged oil wells along the river are causing an increase in salinity levels.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#36">(36)</A> About 1.5 million oil wells have been drilled in Texas, yet less than a third of them have been plugged.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#37">(37)</A> 
<P>
In addition, hundreds of production sites, littered with abandoned tanks, spilled oil, drilling pads and oilfield equipment await remediation and cleanup. (See Water Section). Using money from a surcharge on new drilling permits, the agency has plugged several thousand abandoned wells and cleaned up a number of abandoned production sites.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#38">(38)</A> However, this effort is just beginning and it could take many decades to clear up problems caused by past negligence or lack of enforcement.

<H4>
<A NAME="GAS">NATURAL GAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Natural gas was once considered a useless waste product of the oil production process. Oil producers burned off this gas or vented it into the atmosphere in order to dispose of it. Today, some energy analysts are calling natural gas the "prince of the hydrocarbons."<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#39">(39)</A> 
<P>
Texas consumes more natural gas than any other state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#40">(40)</A> In 1993, Texas consumed 3.4 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), almost twice as much as California, the number two consumer.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#41">(41)</A> Texas produces about 5.5 Tcf of gas every year, which accounts for 25 percent of total U.S. domestic gas production. The state has about 36 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves, or about one-quarter of total U. S. domestic gas reserves.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#42">(42)</A> This wealth of natural gas has contributed nearly $15 trillion in tax revenue to state coffers since 1930.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#43">(43)</A> 
<P>
Natural gas is becoming increasingly important as a source of revenue. From 1985 through 1990, Texas collected more tax revenue from natural gas than from oil.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#44">(44)</A> 
<P>
New uses for natural gas are causing consumption to increase. The fuel can now be used to power air conditioners and is gaining popularity in the transportation sector. Compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG) offer clean-burning alternatives to fleet owners, who must convert large portions of their vehicles to alternative fuels in order to comply with Clean Air Act regulations. Natural gas is also being used more by utilities for power generation. 
<P>
While new uses for gas may help the state over the long term, Texas is depleting its natural gas reserves faster than those reserves are being replaced by new discoveries.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#45">(45)</A> Since 1965, the state's gas reserves have been steadily decreasing.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#46">(46)</A> 
<P>
In 1981, Texas energy producers brought 5,454 natural gas wells into service. By 1991, the number of gas wells brought on-line had fallen to 1,471.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#47">(47)</A> This decline in exploration could have negative long-term effects on Texas, which continues to need vast amounts of natural gas for residential, commercial and industrial uses.

<A NAME="LIQUIFIED">LIQUIFIED PETROLEUM GAS</A> (LPG)
</H4>
<P>
Most consumers know LPG as butane or propane. These liquids are removed from oil and gas during the refining process. A flexible fuel, LPG can be used for everything from burning weeds to powering farm tractors. Propane is second only to natural gas in terms of heat content. One-third of the nation's propane is produced in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#48">(48)</A>
<P>
New concerns about clean air will also likely stimulate consumption of LPG in Texas. Texas used 12.2 billion gallons of LPG in 1990, most of which was consumed by the petrochemical industry.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#49">(49)</A> LPG also plays an important role in rural areas, which often do not have natural gas lines. Millions of rural Texans rely on propane and butane for cooking and water heating. In the commercial sector, LPG powers forklifts and other industrial equipment. The market for LPG will likely be stimulated by its increased use as a motor vehicle fuel. 
<P>
By 2002, federal law will require about one million vehicles in Texas to be fueled by alternative fuels like propane or natural gas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#50">(50)</A> (See Air Section for further discussion.) Propane will likely be the fuel of choice for many operators because converting vehicles to LPG costs about half as much as converting to compressed natural gas (CNG). In addition, LPG-powered vehicles can travel much farther between fueling stops than comparable CNG-powered vehicles. Thus far, nine out of ten Texas school buses that have converted to alternative fuels have switched to propane.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#51">(51)</A> In all, more than 30,000 propane-fueled vehicles are in use in Texas, with some 1,200 propane dealers providing refueling services.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#52">(52)</A> This network of refueling centers gives propane-powered vehicles another advantage over CNG. Only a handful of refueling stations in Texas supply CNG to the public. 
<P>
With its flexibility and availability, LPG will continue to be a major energy source for many years to come.

<A NAME="COAL">COAL</A>
</H4>
<P>
By the time white settlers arrived in Texas, indigenous tribes had been burning coal for many millennia. Between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago, tribal groups near Lake Lewisville were using lignite to heat their homes and cook their food. Archaeological sites in Bastrop County contain burned lignite dating back 5,000 years. Throughout the early 1800s settlers utilized coal they found on the surface and by 1850, small scale mining had begun. 
<P>
Today, Texas leads the nation in coal consumption by a large margin. In 1993, Texas used 96 million tons of coal. By comparison, Indiana, the number two coal-consuming state, used about 60 million tons of coal.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#53">(53)</A> Nearly 95 percent of the coal consumed in Texas was used to generate electricity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#54">(54)</A> 
<P>
Texas mines produce two-thirds of the coal consumed in the state. Some 56 million tons of lignite are mined in Texas annually. The sixth and twelfth largest coal mines in America are located in Texas. The Martin Lake and Monticello mines, both owned by Texas Utilities Mining Co., together produce nearly 25 million tons of lignite per year.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#55">(55)</A> 
<P>
Texas has more than 24 billion tons of lignite that can be recovered through conventional strip mining methods. At current rates of production, Texas' coal supply will last about 400 years.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#56">(56)</A> In addition, the state contains another 35 billion tons of coal in deep reserves. All told, the state's coal deposits contain the energy equivalent of more than 100 billion barrels of oil. 
<P>
Coal consumption in Texas is rising faster than any other form of energy. By 2030, the state's coal consumption is expected to be about 180 million tons per year, twice as much as the state consumed in 1990.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#57">(57)</A> However, the state's appetite for coal has caused serious pollution problems around the state. Five of the top ten sources of air pollution in the state are coal-fired electric power plants.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#58">(58)</A> Studies have linked elevated selenium levels in a number of East Texas Lakes with nearby coal-fired power plants.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#59">(59)</A> 
<P>
Burning coal also produces sulfur dioxide, an air pollutant that can cause acid rain. Acid rain poses a serious threat to East Texas lakes, which have little ability to counter acidic input.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#60">(60)</A> In addition to the air quality problems presented by coal consumption, strip mining presents a range of problems. Since 1982, more than 52,000 acres of land in the state has been strip mined for lignite.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#61">(61)</A> Adequate reclamation of strip mined property is expensive and time consuming. Often, sites are re-planted with just one type of plant material. Biologists point out that the resulting monoculture does not support a diversity of wildlife.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#62">(62)</A> In addition, the strip mined land can be subject to subsidence and erosion.

<A NAME="ELECTRICITY">ELECTRICITY</A>
</H4>
<P>
The Texas economy is changing. The service sector and light manufacturing companies are growing rapidly. The new, high-technology companies rely on computers and the microchip to speed information and products to consumers. But the emerging information economy depends on electric power. So do our air conditioners, answering machines, personal computers, microwave ovens, tape recorders and a panoply of other consumer products.
<P>
The burgeoning Texas economy and the state's rapidly growing population have caused a surge in demand for electricity. From 1970 to 1990, electricity consumption in Texas more than doubled.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#63">(63)</A> Without a change in the pattern of consumption or major conservation efforts, the demand for electricity in Texas will require utilities to build 90 new power plants over the next 15 years.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#64">(64)</A> These new plants could increase the state's electrical capacity by almost 25 percent.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#65">(65)</A> 
<P>
Texas produces and consumes more electricity than any other state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#66">(66)</A> In 1991, Texans paid $14 billion for electricity while consuming 241 million megawatt hours of electricity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#67">(67)</A> Twenty-seven electric utilities are currently operating 312 generating stations in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#68">(68)</A> These facilities have a combined net capacity of 60,687 megawatts. Of the 27 utilities, nine are investor-owned, five are electric cooperatives, five are federal or state agencies and eight are owned by municipalities. 
<P>
Much of the new demand for electric power is coming from the residential sector, where electricity consumption is growing rapidly. In 1970, electricity accounted for 32 percent of the energy needs in the average home. By 1990, electricity supplied 54 percent of residential energy needs. By the year 2000, that figure is expected to rise to 56 percent and by the year 2030, electricity may supply 61 percent of all home energy needs.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#69">(69)</A> 
<P>
In 1992, Texas residents paid about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#70">(70)</A> The Public Utilities Commission of Texas estimates that by the year 2000, consumers will be paying 10.4 cents per kilowatt hour.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#71">(71)</A> In addition to the rising cost of electricity, Texas is facing environmental problems caused by electricity production. Texas is the country's largest consumer of coal (more than 90 million tons per year), and the power plants that burn coal pump millions of tons of carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide (which can cause acid rain), nitrogen oxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere every year. (See Air Chapter for further discussion.)
<P>
In 1977, natural gas accounted for 86 percent of the fuel used to generate electric power in Texas. But in 1978, Congress passed the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act, which required utilities to phase out the use of natural gas as a boiler fuel by 1990. Designed as a response to perceived natural gas shortages, this requirement was later repealed when new gas supplies were discovered. However, by then, many Texas utility companies had begun developing coal supplies, which were viewed as a way to diversify their power-generation base. Today, about 40 percent of all the electricity consumed in Texas is derived from the burning of natural gas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#72">(72)</A> Half of the state's electricity is derived from burning coal. The balance comes from nuclear power, hydropower and renewables. 
<P>
In 1990, electric power generation in the state produced 66 percent of the total sulfur dioxides, 37 percent of total nitrogen oxides and 35 percent of all the carbon dioxide emitted into the air in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#73">(73)</A> As noted above, coal-fired power plants have been linked to acidification in several East Texas lakes. The same lakes have also been contaminated by selenium, a heavy metal linked to the coal-fired power plants. 
<P>
The question of global warming has also not been fully assessed. Scientists from around the world believe that carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere will cause a gradual warming of the Earth, which could have catastrophic effects on agriculture and coastal zones. Fossil fuel-fired electric power plants produce millions of tons of CO2 per year. (See section on air). Some environmental groups favor new regulations that would change the way Texas' electric utilities operate. Called integrated resource planning, the program would encourage utilities to increase efficiency programs. In addition, it would require utilities to take into account the cost of the pollutants that they emit. Many other states, including Nevada, Oregon and New York have adopted similar regulations. But thus far, the Texas Legislature has not required Texas power producers to factor efficiency and pollution issues into their decision-making process. 
<P>
Advances in efficiency could help slow the demand for electricity. High efficiency appliances, lights and motors could go a long way toward reducing Texas' demand for electricity. (See efficiency section below).

In 1977, natural gas accounted for 86 percent of the fuel used to generate electric power in Texas. Increasing use of coal, lignite and nuclear power during the 1980s reduced reliance on natural gas to less than 40 percent of total generation by 1991. Because of its clean burning characteristics, however, gas is expected to increase its share to 42 percent by 2002.

<A NAME="COGENERATION">Cogeneration </A>
</H4>
<P>
Electricity is inherently inefficient to produce. Up to two-thirds of the heat energy in a fuel source is lost while making electric power. Cogeneration is a process that generates electricity and heat at the same time. Cogeneration units are up to 50 percent more efficient than standard power plants.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#74">(74)</A> Industrial users were among the first to embrace cogeneration because it allows large industrial plants to generate electricity while using the heat for industrial processes. In addition, cogeneration units are advocated by some energy analysts because they are cheaper to build than large power units.
<P>
Between 1980 and 1992, the amount of electricity derived from cogeneration has increased tenfold.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#75">(75)</A> Texas now gets more than 7,300 megawatts of power from cogeneration plants. At present, 80 percent of the state's cogeneration plants are operated by petrochemical and chemical producers along the Gulf Coast. 
<P>
Federal regulations require local utilities to purchase excess power from cogeneration facilities. And because of its efficiency, cogeneration is expected to increase. By 2005, some 10,000 megawatts of cogeneration capacity are predicted to be available in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#76">(76)</A>

<H4>TEXAS ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION BY SECTOR</H4>
<IMG SRC="c.econsumpt.gif" BORDER=4 ALIGN=middle ALT="Bar Chart of Electricity Consumption by Sector">

<P>
Utilities in Texas sold $14.7 billion worth of electricity to 7.7 million customers in 1992. Texas' 59,000 industrial users, only one percent of all customers, provided one-quarter of all revenues and used more than one-third of all power sold.
<P>
Total electricity consumed in 1992: 239.4 trillion kilowatt hours. One kilowatt hour equals the energy consumed by ten 100 watt light bulbs burning for one hour.

<H4>
<A NAME="NUCLEAR">Nuclear Power</A>
</H4>
<P>
In 1942, Dr. Enrico Fermi assembled enough uranium to cause a nuclear fission reaction. Nine years later, in 1951, the first electric power was produced from the atom, when an experimental reactor lit up four light bulbs in a laboratory experiment. Today, more than half of all Texans rely on nuclear power as one of their sources of electricity. But the debate continues over how successful Texas' experiment with nuclear power has been. 
<P>
Texas now has 4,802 megawatts of installed nuclear power capacity coming from two plants: the 2,300-megawatt Comanche Peak project in Somervell County and the 2,502-megawatt South Texas Project in Matagorda County. The combined cost of constructing the two facilities was $15.6 billion.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#77">(77)</A> Part of the reason the plants were so expensive was that construction took many years longer than expected. The two units at Comanche Peak were under construction longer than any nuclear plant now operating in the U.S. Comanche Peak Unit Two got a construction permit in December of 1974, but did not begin operating until August of 1992.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#78">(78)</A> 
<P>
Concerns about safety and construction procedures have also hampered the South Texas Project in Matagorda County. The project got underway in 1975 and began generating power in 1988. It ran ten months before a fire caused the reactor to be shut down for six weeks.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#79">(79)</A> The plant was closed for most of 1993 after Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors discovered problems with maintenance, security and management at the plant. The facility came back on-line in February of 1994, only to shut down a few days later due to a faulty water pump. The plant is now re-opened but under close scrutiny by the NRC to prevent further problems. 
<P>
In 1992, the South Texas Project and Comanche Peak generated nearly 24.5 billion kilowatt hours of electricity, which accounted for more than 10 percent of all the electricity consumed in the state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#80">(80)</A> While the two plants are the only nuclear generating stations in Texas, many state residents consume electricity from nuclear plants located in other states. For instance, El Paso residents may get power from the Palo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona. Many East Texas residents use Louisiana's River Bend nuclear plant for electricity. In all, about 10 million Texans rely on utilities that produce nuclear power.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#81">(81)</A> 
<P>
Some anti-nuclear groups continue to advocate shutting down the nuclear plants immediately. They argue the move would save money for ratepayers over the long term because nuclear plants pose safety problems that could be very expensive to resolve. For instance, an accident like the one that occurred at the Chernobyl plant in the former Soviet Union could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. In addition, they say the long-term storage costs of radioactive waste are too expensive. 
<P>
However, nuclear power proponents point out that when operated correctly, nuclear plants emit little or no carbon dioxide. And they say that the plants will save ratepayers money over the long term because the fuel costs for nuclear power plants are far less than fuel costs for conventional fossil fuel plants. 
<P>
Disposing of radioactive waste from nuclear plants does present a difficult long-term problem. Texas used to send its low-level radioactive waste to a facility in Barnwell, South Carolina. However, that facility has reached its capacity. Low level radioactive waste is now stored above ground at each facility. The state of Texas plans to locate a low-level nuclear waste disposal site in Hudspeth County, but many local residents oppose the project. And even if the facility is approved, it will not open until the late 1990s.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#82">(82)</A> 
<P>
Under Texas law, low-level radioactive waste is defined as waste having a half life of 35 years. By law, all nuclear waste other than used fuel rods from power plants is classified as "low-level." These waste include items such as workers' discarded gloves and paper booties, as well as radioactive cooling water pipes and valves. These waste must be kept isolated for hundreds, if not thousands, of years in areas that are arid, geologically stable, and can be secured for centuries.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#83">(83)</A> Low-level storage facilities must monitor disposal sites for at least 350 years to assure that the waste returns to background levels of radioactivity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#84">(84)</A> 
<P>
A nuclear reactor produces about 30 tons of high-level and low-level radioactive material per year that must be stored safely.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#85">(85)</A> The most dangerous of these waste are spent fuel rods. The highly radioactive fuel rods are even more problematic than low-level waste. The U.S. Department of Energy has proposed a final storage site for the fuel rods at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. However, the site is still being investigated for its suitability and even if it is approved, it will not be ready to accept the spent fuel rods until 2010 at the earliest.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#86">(86)</A> 
<P>
Decommissioning, or shutting down the power plants, presents another long-term problem for the nuclear power industry. Shutting down Texas' nuclear plants will likely cost consumers several billion dollars. The exact cost of decommissioning the plants is unknown because none of the large generators has been decommissioned yet. However, state officials estimate that disposing of low-level waste from a decommissioned plant could cost up to $250 million.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#87">(87)</A> Labor costs and other costs could make the final cost several times that figure. Indeed, the few power plants that have been shut down have cost as much to decommission as they did to construct.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#88">(88)</A> 
<P>
No new nuclear power plants have been ordered in recent years. But new regulations under the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 could make it easier for utilities to build new nuclear generating stations.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#89">(89)</A> Before any new plants are built, however, the public will have to be convinced that viable waste disposal options are available for radioactive waste. In addition, citizens will have to be convinced that the plants are safe, cost competitive and that the mistakes of earlier projects will not be repeated. 
<H4>
<A NAME="URANIUM">Uranium</A>
</H4>
<P>
The nuclear power industry depends on uranium. For decades, Texas was a leading producer of this heavy, silvery-white element which can also be made into nuclear weapons. In the mid-1970s when the price of uranium was more than $40 per pound, nearly a dozen companies were operating some 35 uranium-mining sites in seven South Texas counties. Today, with the price at about $10 per pound, only a handful of companies continue to produce uranium in the state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#90">(90)</A> 
<P>
Uranium used to be strip mined with technology similar to that used in coal mining. These uranium strip mine operations created large areas requiring remediation. Large tailings ponds have been created to contain the radioactive materials. These ponds, located in Karnes and Live Oak Counties, may pose a long-term threat to surface water and subsurface aquifers because they are subject to leakage. Federal law requires the tailings ponds, which contain materials that will remain radioactive for more than 1,600 years, to be covered, so that rainwater does not mix with the radioactive waste. However, these pond coverings may be eroded over time by water and wind, which could allow radium to escape into the atmosphere. The ponds must be monitored for centuries to assure that they are properly containing the radioactive waste. 
<P>
Today, most uranium mining is done with injection wells, which pump fluid through the geologic formations where the mineral is found. Production wells then bring the uranium-bearing solution to the surface. Called "solution mining" or "in-situ" mining, this method causes relatively little disturbance of the surface. However, this process can contaminate groundwater, which must then be disposed of by injection into deep formations below fresh water aquifers.

<A NAME="EFFICIENCY">ENERGY EFFICIENCY</A>
</H4>
<P>
Energy efficiency means you get more work from the same amount of energy. For instance, one gallon of gasoline can take you 30 miles in one car, while another, less efficient car, will take you only half as far. Energy efficiency saves consumers money, requires no compromise in lifestyle, reduces air pollution and contributes to economic growth. 
<P>
Over the past two decades, Texas' energy consumption per dollar of gross state product has declined. In 1970, the state consumed 40,000 Btu's per dollar of gross state product. It fell to 27,000 Btu's per dollar in 1990. By the year 2020, forecasters project it will fall to 15,000 Btu's per dollar of GSP.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#91">(91)</A> 
<P>
Federal regulations forced automobile manufacturers to increase the efficiency of the vehicles they produce. The result: between 1978 and 1990, the average vehicle increased fuel economy from 18 mpg to 27.5 mpg. Despite these increases in performance, the amount of energy used in Texas' transportation sector nearly doubled between 1970 and 1991 because there are more cars on the road and Texans are driving more miles per year.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#92">(92)</A> 
<P>
From 1982 to 1992, the 12 largest utilities in Texas spent about $408 million per year on energy efficiency programs. During the same time period, they spent nearly $1 billion a year on nuclear power alone.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#93">(93)</A> One of the most serious efforts at conservation in the state has been undertaken by the City of Austin, which has spent about $60 million on projects like home insulation, providing rebates to customers who install energy retrofits and attend educational workshops. The effort is now saving the city 190 megawatts of generating capacity per year, or about one-tenth of the city's installed electrical capacity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#94">(94)</A> If other utilities in the state began implementing aggressive programs like the one used by the Austin utility, Texas ratepayers would save billions of dollars per year while reducing pollution. 
<P>
Studies have shown that the state could avoid building any new electric generating plants over the next 15 years if Texas embraced conservation and a comprehensive set of energy efficiency technologies.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#97">(97)</A> 
<P>
Cooling units offer the greatest potential gains in efficiency. One third of all the electricity used by Texas residential customers is used for air conditioning. That is almost three times the national average.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#98">(98)</A> Also, a study by the University of Texas Center for Energy Studies found that replacing old refrigerators with high efficiency models offers the greatest single savings in electrical consumption. The reason is simple: refrigerators run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
<P>
Increasing the efficiency of air conditioners, heaters, motors and lighting units will also save vast amounts of energy. One study found that cooling, heating and lighting in buildings accounts for 73 percent of peak electric demand in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#99">(99)</A> The same study discerned that almost half of the electricity consumed in Texas buildings could be saved if efficiency measures were employed.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#100">(100)</A>

</th></tr><tr><td>
<B>1. Make sure your air conditioner is efficient.</B>It should have an SEER* rating of at least 11. If your unit is 10 or more years old, chances are it is inefficient (compared to today's high-efficiency models) and is costing you much more than it should.
<p>
<B>2. Get a properly sized unit. </B>If you replace your old air conditioner, buy one that is the correct size. If it is too small or too large for your house, you will have trouble staying comfortable, and it will cost more to operate.
<p>
<B>3. Insulate walls and attic. </B>Utilities recommend that insulation with an R-30** value be used in your attic. If you are building a home, walls should have insulation rated at R-15. In an existing home, wall insulation should be brought up at least to R-11 if feasible. If your house is on piers, floor insulation should be R-19. Good insulation can pay for itself in just a few years.
<p>
<B>4. Close up those air leaks. </B>You can save 10 to 30 percent on air conditioning costs with a well-sealed house. Weatherstrip or caulk around doors, windows, outlets, switch plates and plumbing outlets.
<p>
<B>5. Raise your thermostat setting. </B>By raising your thermostat setting just one degree, you can save as much as 14 percent on your cooling costs. A setting of 78 degrees is recommended.
<p>
<B>A reminder: </B>A dirty filter can cause your air conditioner to work harder and can lead to equipment breakdowns. Utilities suggest changing or cleaning your filters at least once a month. During the hottest part of summer, every two weeks is a good idea.

<tr><th>SAVING WATER
</th></tr><tr><td>
Saving water saves electricity. Water utilities spend millions of dollars per year on electricity which is used to treat and deliver water. A study by Southern California Edison found that fully 10 percent of the electricity it generates is used to treat, heat and pump water to homes and businesses.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#95">(95)</A> 
<p>
Utilities around the country have found that when customers save water, it reduces the amount of water a utility must pump, which in turn, saves electricity. To maximize these savings, many utilities are distributing faucet aerators, efficient shower heads, low-flow toilets and other water saving devices to customers at no charge. 
<p>
Some cities pay residents to replace old fixtures. New York City pays rebates up to $240 for each toilet replaced with a new 1.6 gallon model. San Antonio, Austin and El Paso offer rebates to residential customers who install low-flow toilets. Utility officials in Austin estimate that 2 percent of the electricity generated by the city is used solely for pumping and treating water. 
<p>
Efficient irrigation systems also offer substantial energy savings. In Oregon, rural utilities are offering low-interest loans to farmers who replace their old irrigation equipment with high-efficiency pumps and more efficient irrigation systems. Farmers in the region are now saving 20 to 25 percent on their water and electricity bills.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#96">(96)</A> 
<p>
Many Texas cities and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission are promoting drought-tolerant landscaping, called xeriscaping, to help conserve water. Use of this landscaping technique will help conserve electricity as well.

<A NAME="RENEWABLE">RENEWABLE ENERGY</A>
</H4>
<P>
With its fertile soil, sunny weather and strong winds, Texas holds great promise for renewable energy. Wind energy, solar power, biomass and hydropower could play large roles in the state's energy mix. However, at present, the state derives only about 0.4 percent of its total energy demand from renewable sources.
<H4>
<A NAME="WIND">Wind</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas residents have been harnessing the stiff Texas breeze for decades. Before electrification, rural residents relied on windchargers for electricity. Similar to windmills, these units turned wind energy into electric energy, which was used to charge batteries that powered electric lights and other devices. Rural residents also relied on windmills to pump water. Today, many windmills have been replaced by electric water pumps, but some 80,000 windmills continue to pump water for rural agricultural users in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#101">(101)</A>
<P>
Wind could provide Texas with vast amounts of electricity. Studies have shown that up to 136,000 megawatts of electricity - more than twice the state's total generating capacity - could be generated in Texas if all the state's wind resources could be captured.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#102">(102)</A> Unlike fossil fuel-fired power plants, wind-energy plants do not create carbon dioxide or other air pollutants. 
<P>
Wind farms in California have proven wind can be a reliable energy source. California now gets 1,600 megawatts of power from 17,000 wind turbines and the state is developing 1,500 megawatts of new wind power.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#103">(103)</A> Although California leads the world in wind-energy production, Texas has almost 20 times more wind-energy potential than California. <A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#104">(104)</A> 
<P>
Several utilities have taken note of Texas' wind-energy potential and numerous projects are underway in West Texas. Some 250 megawatts of wind-generated electricity will come on-line in 1995.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#105">(105)</A> While wind-energy shows great potential, several hurdles must be cleared before it will become a major energy source in the state. First, all of the planned wind units will be in the rural areas of West Texas, far from the urban and industrial areas where electric demand is highest. To capture all of these wind resources, new transmission lines will have to be built. No reliable estimates are available regarding the cost of building these new power lines. 
<P>
Second, wind farms can threaten wildlife. For reasons still not clear to biologists, the wind turbines have killed many birds of prey. But wind energy promoters say the bird mortality problem can be solved. 
<P>
The new class of wind turbines can generate power for as little as five cents per kilowatt hour, slightly more than the cost of coal-fired power plants. But when external costs, like air pollution are figured in, wind may be a cheaper power source than either fossil-fuel or nuclear plants.

<H4>
<A NAME="SOLAR">Solar</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas' solar energy potential far exceeds its wind energy potential. If the 262,000 square miles of Texas were covered with solar cells, the state would generate 550 quadrillion Btu's of electrical energy every year. That is equal to one and a half times the total energy used in the world.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#106">(106)</A> Obviously, the state won't ever be paved with solar cells, but Texas could easily incorporate solar power into the fuel mix. 
<P>
Texans already rely on photovoltaic cells to power highway lights, railroad switches, weather stations, outdoor lighting, gate openers and many other devices. Cheaper to install in remote areas than conventional power lines, photovoltaics are gaining popularity as evidenced by their increasingly common application in rural parts of the Third World. 
<P>
Some Texas utilities are looking at increased use of the solar cells as a low-cost, non-polluting source of power generation. For example, the city of Austin electric utility operates two photovoltaic stations that generate 450 kilowatts of electric power - enough to supply 50 to 100 homes. The Austin utility is the largest solar power producer in the state. 
<P>
As the price of producing photovoltaics continues to decline, solar cells could become a more common source of power. For example, utility companies in California have begun installing photovoltaic systems on residential rooftops. 
<P>
Solar water heaters could decrease demand for natural gas and electricity. In use for decades, solar water heaters are relatively inexpensive and can heat water for household use or provide space heating during winter months. To cut electricity usage, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District has financed the installation of solar water heaters on its customers' rooftops. Some 1,800 residents in the California town have now installed the units, which are providing hot water at a cost far lower than electrical heating units.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#107">(107)</A> 
<P>
Thermal solar power generators also offer great promise. Already installed in California, these systems use reflective mirrors to concentrate sunlight, which then heats oil or water to generate steam. That steam then drives a turbine which generates electricity. This technology is now being tested in West Texas. 
<P><P>

<H4>
<A NAME="HYDRO">Hydro</A>
</H4>
<P>
The stored energy of water has been used by humans for centuries. Streams and rivers were dammed or re-routed to provide power for milling grain or cutting lumber. Today, dams are an important part of the Texas economy, providing water for irrigation and recreation as well as electricity for industrial and residential use. 
<P>
Dams in Texas provide 529 megawatts of electric generating capacity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#108">(108)</A> While that is only a fraction of the state's total electric needs, these hydropower facilities are non-polluting and provide reliable power. However, expanding the state's hydropower base may be difficult, as dams can adversely affect aquatic habitat and free-flowing streams. 
<H4>
<A NAME="BIOMASS">Biomass</A>
</H4>
<P>
Three communities in Texas - Center, Cleburne and Carthage - are using municipal solid waste to generate electricity. (However, this is not a perfect technology. See <I>Municipal Solid Waste </I>Chapter.) Half of the lumber companies and three-fourths of the paper companies in Texas burn wood waste to generate power.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#109">(109)</A> Texas generates huge amounts of plant and animal waste that could be utilized for thermal power generation. Every year, Texas produces some two quadrillion Btu's of energy in the form of agricultural waste, municipal waste and energy crops.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#110">(110)</A> If all that energy could be recovered, it would be enough to generate two-thirds of all the electricity used in Texas. State agencies are now examining how biomass might be used to generate electricity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#111">(111)</A>
<P>
As a large grain-producing state, Texas may be able to use some of its farm production to make ethanol and methanol, which can be used as a motor fuel. They can also be combined with gasoline. Ethanol is an alcohol-based fuel made from fermenting grains and sugars. Methanol can be produced from municipal solid waste, crop residues, natural gas or coal. However these fuels have drawbacks. Methanol is highly toxic. Ethanol contains less heat energy than gasoline. Thus, vehicles running on ethanol get about 30 percent fewer miles per gallon than similar gasoline-powered vehicles. Both methanol and ethanol emit gases that are suspected carcinogens.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#112">(112)</A> These drawbacks could limit the use of these fuels. 
<P>
Increased use of biomass as an energy source has only recently gained attention. But this resource could play a larger role in Texas' renewable energy mix.

<A NAME="SAFELY">INDUSTRIAL</A> SOLID WASTE: WHERE TO SAFELY PUT IT?
</H4>
<P>
Industrial solid waste can be managed either on-site - at the facility where it is generated - or off-site at commercial facilities. Whether on-site or off-site, industrial solid waste can be disposed of through the use of municipal and industrial wastewater facilities; land disposal facilities such as landfills, waste pits - principally for petroleum exploration waste - and deep underground injection wells; and incineration or waste-to-energy facilities like cement kilns. A variety of treatment, recycling and other management options also exist for many types of industrial waste. 
<P>
About 96 percent of hazardous waste and 99 percent of Class 1 waste were managed on site (at the facility where the waste is generated) in 1991. The majority of on-site management is through wastewater treatment facilities, which consist of storage and treatment tanks as well as more complex wastewater treatment.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#46">(46)</A> Once the level of hazardous waste is decreased to a certain level by treatment, the water is then discharged, either through a publicly-owned (wastewater) treatment works or from the industrial facility itself. Besides on-site waste-water facilities, most of the other waste managed on-site was injected underground into deep wells.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#47">(47)</A>

<I>Maquiladoras</I> are manufacturing plants located in Mexico which import at least 75 percent of their raw materials, assemble them in Mexico and export a finished product, usually to the U.S. In 1991, 673 <I>maquiladoras </I>were located along the Texas-Mexico border.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#53">(53)</A> Most of these <I>maquiladoras </I>are at least partially owned by U.S. corporations and use U.S. raw materials to make products such as semiconductors, electronic components, chemicals and auto parts. 
<P>
Under both Mexican law and a U.S.-Mexico agreement, the waste from production must also be returned to the country from which the raw materials were imported.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#54">(54)</A> Despite this requirement, however, Texas commercial facilities reportedly only treated 1,800 tons of hazardous waste from Mexico in 1991.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#55">(55)</A> While little is known about the actual amount of hazardous waste generated in maquila plants, evidence suggests that the volume of hazardous waste is many times higher than what is returned. The World Bank, for example, estimated that 80 percent of the hazardous waste is not repatriated, but remains stored on-site or is otherwise illegally disposed of in Mexico.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#56">(56)</A>
<P>
A new hazardous waste tracking system, called HAZTRAKS, was implemented in 1993 by the Environmental Protection Agency to better track how much hazardous waste was being imported from Mexico and to also help determine if hazardous waste regulations were being violated. The computer system uses the "cradle-to-grave" hazardous waste manifests to record the waste from its initial generation and transport to its disposal. EPA officials are sent manifests from U.S. Customs about a week after the shipments cross the border, while the final manifests finally reach HAZTRAKS some six months after the border crossing. In addition, Mexico has provided information to the system from its import and export guides filed by companies with its government.
<P>
Mexico also currently has a ban on the import of hazardous waste for disposal. However, the country does allow the import of waste if it is used to recycle or recover valuable materials. For example, cement kiln facilities are allowed to import hazardous waste if they use it to help power their production process. This recycling exemption on the ban of hazardous waste is controversial. In 1991, Texas industries shipped about 25,224 tons of hazardous waste to commercial management facilities for recycling in Mexico.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#57">(57)</A>

WHAT ARE "TOXICS" AND WHERE DO THEY GO?
</th></tr><tr><td>
All major manufacturing industries must report their releases and transfers of more than 300 individual toxic chemicals and 20 toxic chemi-cal compounds - chemicals which have been determined to be harmful to humans and/or the environment - to both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. Of these specific chemicals, 123 are defined as carcino-gens based on work-place standards, while chemicals like ozone depleters may affect the environment more directly than humans.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#60">(60)</A> 
<P>
Texas facilities released 381 million pounds of these toxic chemicals in 1993 to the air, water and land -- both above and below the ground -- while transferring another 91 million pounds to other authorized facilities for treatment, storage and disposal.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#61">(61)</A> Texas is the second largest volume producer of toxic chemical releases and the largest producer of releases and transfers in the country.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#62">(62)</A> However, it should be noted that Texas is also the second largest state in terms of population, and has the largest concentration of certain types of industries such as chemicals and petroleum refining. 
<P>
From 1987 to 1993, Texas showed a 23.2 percent reduction in on-site releases and off-site transfers.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#63">(63)</A> In fact, Texas industries have reduced toxic productions faster than industries in other states. However, interpreting these numbers is difficult. Each year there are a different number of facilities reporting. The amount of toxic releases and transfers is affected by the amount of production and general economic conditions. Still, most major companies have significantly reduced toxic releases over the last five years (see section on waste minimization and source reduction).

<P>
Only 4 percent of hazardous waste in Texas was treated off-site in 1991. That year, 4,414,400 tons of hazardous waste were treated at domestic wastewater facilities; 470,000 tons were treated at commercial facilities in Texas; 315,300 tons were sent out-of-state to commercial facilities; and another 201,300 tons went to other "captive" facilities owned by the same company.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#48">(48)</A> More than 40 percent of Texas-generated hazardous waste which went to commercial treatment facilities was exported to other states.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#49">(49)</A> Texas imported about the same amount of hazardous waste as it exported. Most of the imported hazardous waste went to commercial deep-well injection facilities.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#50">(50)</A>
<P>
In addition to these hazardous waste, in 1991 Texas facilities sent 613,700 tons of Class 1 non-hazardous waste - out of 103 million tons generated - to commercial facilities.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#51">(51)</A> There are just a few facilities in the state which manage only non-hazardous industrial waste commercially. For example, 398,000 tons of industrial waste were sent to either in-state or out-of-state landfills in 1991.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#52">(52)</A> Contaminated soils and solids, asbestos materials and PCB contaminated materials made up about 67 percent of the "non-hazardous" industrial waste. Most of the remainder was shipped to a commercial injection well.
<P>
Is there enough space available to take care of all of these waste? In most cases, yes. In a 1994 report on commercial capacity, the TNRCC found that there would be sufficient space to manage Texas waste in 1995, except in the following categories:
<P>
<OL>
	<LI>  Recovery technologies - zinc recovery and carbon filter regeneration;
	<P>
	<LI>  Treatment and destruction technologies, such as reduction and neutralization of inorganic compounds, biological treatment and carbon adsorption, among others; 
	<P>
	<LI>  Landfills for non-hazardous industrial waste and for some treated hazardous waste.
</OL>
<P>
The report found that Texas was lacking in some technologies to recycle and destroy hazardous waste, yet (with the exception of landfilling) had enough disposal capacity for waste that can't be destroyed or recycled. It also noted that a limited number of facilities may be available nationally to manage these waste streams.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#58">(58)</A> In late 1994, a new hazardous waste landfill in Andrews County was permitted, which should provide additional capacity by 1996.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#59">(59)</A>

<H4><A NAME="NATURAL">NATURAL SCIENCE 101</A>
</H4>
<P>
Soil is the material that is formed from rocks and decaying plants and animals; it makes up the outermost layer of the earth. There are at least 70,000 kinds of soil in the United States. Topsoil is considered the most productive soil layer. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, natural processes can take 500 years to form one inch of topsoil.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#1">(1)</A>

<H4><A NAME="CROPLAND">CROPLAND EROSION</A></H4>
Though concern for soil erosion in the United States dates back to the days of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, the federal government did not take action to address the problem until 1933. The dust storms of the 1930s, particularly in Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado and Kansas, resulted in tremendous crop and farm loss and thousands of unemployed farmers.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#2">(2)</A> This brought Presidential and Congressional attention to issues of soil erosion. 
<P>
One of the first steps Congress took was to create the Civilian Conservation Corps, which put unemployed men, including farmers, to work planting trees and building erosion control dams. In 1935, the Soil Conservation Service was established within the United States Department of Agriculture and began to work directly with farmers around the country creating soil and water conservation districts. Soil and Water Conservation Districts are political subdivisions of the state, governed by a board of directors elected by resident landowners of the district. Some of the soil erosion correctives recommended in the 1930s included crop rotation, contour plowing, planting tree rows and leaving marginal lands as pasture land. These practices were credited with arresting soil erosion for a time.  
<P>
Texas enacted its own Soil Conservation Laws in 1939, resulting in the establishment of the Texas Soil and Water Conservation Board. The Board coordinates the activities of the local soil and water conservation districts, which numbered 213 in 1994. 
<P>
In the 1970s, an increase in worldwide demand for farm commodities led the U.S. government to create new crop subsidy incentives to persuade farmers to plant "fencerow to fencerow." Farmers eager to increase production put marginal lands into production and discontinued the practice of crop rotation. To combat the depletion of overused soils, farmers had to increase their use of chemical fertilizers. By the mid 1980s, new federal action was needed to confront the problem of soil erosion. The current Food Security Act of 1985 (aka the 1985 Farm Bill) contains two major features, informally called the "sodbuster" programs, that address soil erosion. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) pays farmers to take highly erodible land out of production for 10 years. The Conservation Compliance Provision (CCP) requires farmers with highly erodible land to implement approved conservation plans by December 31, 1994, to be eligible for any federal farm program benefits.      
<P>
Large scale loss of soil from erosion results in at least two major environmental problems. First, cropland becomes less productive because the soil left after erosion loses its fertility and is unable to supply plants with necessary nutrients. The soil's ability to retain water is also greatly diminished. These changes, in turn, result in higher production costs, including the costs for the increased use of petrochemical-based fertilizers. Second, soil erosion by water causes sedimentation in waterways which threatens aquatic life and hinders the water flow. Soil erosion by water also carries polluting agricultural chemicals into rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs. According to a 1989 study conducted by the National Academy of Sciences, 350 to 400 million acres of agricultural land are estimated to account for more than 50 percent of suspended sediments deposited in surface waters in the United States.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#3">(3)</A>  
<P>
Experts recognize the difficulty in accurately assessing costs of soil erosion, but the USDA has estimated that the offsite costs to society of erosion in the United States are between $2 billion and $8 billion annually, and the direct onsite farm cost is estimated at $1 billion to $18 billion per year.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#4">(4)</A>  The United States Department of Agriculture, however, has expressed doubts about the reliability of these estimates.

<H4>
<A NAME="CONDITIONS">CONDITIONS IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Of the 32 million acres of cropland in Texas, more than 12.8 million acres or 40 percent are classified as highly erodible.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#5">(5)</A>  With an average loss of 14 tons of soil per acre annually, Texas is one of the eight worst states for soil erosion rates.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#6">(6)</A>    
<P>
Water erosion is the primary concern for the central and eastern parts of Texas. Wind erosion is the primary concern in far west Texas and the High Plains region. Both wind and water are concerns in the Rolling Plains and southern parts of the state.
<P>
The Federal and State agencies that have major responsibility for the well-being of our soil are:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>The Consolidated Farm Service Agency, formerly known as the USDA Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Services.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#7">(7)</A> This is the USDA's state-level administrative arm. Since the 1930s, Texas and other states have received federal monies under the Agricultural Conservation Program for direct assistance to producers. Under this program, the Consolidated Farm Service Agency distributes approximately $13 million federal dollars annually to Texas producers to assist them in implementing 15 to 20 best management practices. These practices include terracing, ponds, wells, irrigation and agriculture waste facilities. In 1993, approximately $164,000,000 was distributed to Texas farmers under the Conservation Reserve Program.
	<P>
	<LI>The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, formerly the Soil Conservation Service. This service is responsible for all soil and water conservation programs, the Wetlands Reserve program and other programs related to natural resources conservation. Through a memorandum of understanding with local Soil Conservation Districts, the Service assists agricultural producers, on a voluntary basis, in designing site-specific conservation management plans. 
	<P>
	<LI>The Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board. This is a state agency with a five member Board elected by delegations from the soil conservation districts. The Board coordinates the activities of the Soil and Water Conservation Districts, develops a statewide conservation plan and is the lead agency for designing site-specific programs to abate non-point source pollution resulting from agriculture and silviculture. In fiscal year 1994, the Board received a state appropriation of $5,200,586. Almost $2 million of this was targeted for the non-point source pollution programs. For fiscal year 1995, the Board was appropriated $7,319,298, of which approximately $4,035,187 is targeted for non-point source pollution programs.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#8">(8)</A>
	<P>
	<LI>The Soil and Water Conservation Districts. There are 213 soil conservation districts in Texas. Most districts conform to county boundary lines. Each district has an elected board of directors made up of district landowners. Among other activities, the local Soil Conservation District Board coordinates the technical assistance to producers provided by USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. The districts also prepare long-range soil and water conservation plans for the area.   
	<P>
	<LI>The Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, formerly the Texas A&amp;M Extension Service. This Service provides a link between agricultural producers and agricultural research. Through county offices, it provides educational programs and materials to producers, farm workers and homeowners on such subjects as the proper use of agricultural chemicals, new agricultural technology and conservation practices.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> Natural resource experts have divided Texas into 11 major land resource areas, based on similar soils, vegetation, climate and land uses. These are often referred to as "ecoregions." 
</UL>
<P>
Soil erosion levels vary among types of soil, and, of course, some erosion is natural and inevitable. The amount of soil erosion that most cropland can tolerate without reducing production is termed by the United States Department of Agriculture the "T" factor. In Texas, the "T" factor for most cropland is about five tons per acre per year.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#10">(10)</A>  Most Texas cropland can lose five tons of soil a year for an indefinite period of time without production being affected. The objective of conservation practices is to bring erosion down to or below this "T" factor.    
<P>
According to the Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board, total gross sheet and rill erosion within Texas averages about 229 million tons annually. This is an average annual rate of 1.36 tons per acre. Gross gully and stream erosion averages about 98 million tons annually, or an average rate of 0.58 tons per acre.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#11">(11)</A>
<P>
Soil erosion by water is a problem on about 24.3 million acres of Texas cropland and grassland.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#12">(12)</A> Figures are not available on the number of acres on which wind erosion has a large impact.

<TR><TH> SEDIMENTATION
</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>
Sedimentation is usually the end result of the erosion process. When a soil particle is detached and transported by water to a new site of deposit, it is referred to as sediment. The soil particle might be temporarily deposited several times before it reaches its end destination.

<A NAME="EROSION">CROPLAND EROSION AND SURFACE WATER</A>
</H4>
<p>
Cropland erosion has impacts on more than agricultural production. According to studies conducted by the USDA in 1987, agriculture accounts for more than "50 percent of suspended sediments from all sources discharged in surface waters" and greater proportions in predominantly agricultural regions.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#13">(13)</A> Findings of a nationwide study conducted from 1974 to 1981 concluded that surface water sediment deposition was "significantly related to cropland erosion within basins. It was not closely related to estimates of total basin erosion from forest land, pasture land or range land."<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#14">(14) </A> 
<p>
The increased murkiness in the water caused by sediment loading decreases light for submerged aquatic vegetation. As a result, both aquatic vegetation and species that depend on aquatic vegetation for breeding and food can decline.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#15">(15)</A> The relationship between sediment and nutrient runoff from agricultural lands and their effects on estuaries is discussed in the water chapter. Sediment loading can also fill reservoirs, clog navigable waterways, reduce recreational use of waters and increase operating costs of water-treatment facilities.  
<p>
Some sediment deposits can be beneficial, however. For example, the replenishment of beaches is dependent upon sediment deposits from rivers. 
<p>
The USDA estimates that putting 30 to 40 million acres of highly erodible U.S. cropland out of production and into the Conservation Reserve Program will reduce sediment delivery to surface waters by as much as 200 million tons per year.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#16">(16)</A>
<p>
Texas has no data that show whether various erosion control strategies have reduced sedimentation in Texas surface waters. The Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board states that "soil erosion and sediment production continue to be major problems in Texas," though it speculates that there has been significant improvement in the last few decades.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#17">(17)</A> The Board, lead agency for non-point source pollution from agriculture, has recommended expanded stream and reservoir sedimentation studies, stating that past studies have been incomplete.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#18">(18)</A>
<p>
According to the Texas Water Development Board, sediment buildup in reservoirs has not caused a major water supply problem to date, but the agency continues to monitor the situation. The TWDB studies show that Lake Buchanan in Central Texas does have noticeable amounts of sediment as does Lake Corpus Christi.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#19">(19)</A>   
<p>
In Texas, average annual sediment yields - that portion of the total eroded soil that reaches a reservoir - vary from one land resource area to another and vary within land resource areas. According to a USDA study, sediment yields have varied from a low of 0.6 acre-foot per square mile at a site west of Lampasas to a high of 8.60 acre-feet per square mile at a site northeast of Bowie in Montague county.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#20">(20)</A>

<A NAME="ABATEMENT">SOIL EROSION ABATEMENT PROGRAMS</A>
</H4>
<p>
One of the best treatments for highly erodible land is to take it out of production and plant grass cover.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#21">(21)</A> To speed this practice along, the 1985 Farm Bill's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was formulated to provide financial incentives to farmers who voluntarily take highly erodible cropland and other environmentally fragile land (e.g., wetlands, wildlife habitat) out of production for ten years. This means no haying, grazing or harvesting of the land. Though there is a 25 percent cap per county on the amount of land that can be eligible, the program does provide farmers with the opportunity to receive $40 per acre per year rental fee to retire land and a 50/50 cost-share payment to plant a permanent soil-conserving cover.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#22">(22)</A> 
<p>
Cropland retired under the CRP was eroding at 13 tons per acre per year. After taking it out of production and establishing coverage, the rate of erosion is 2 tons per year.  
<p>
With 4.2 million acres - 12 percent of all cropland - in the Conservation Reserve Program, Texas has more land in the program than any other state.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#23">(23)</A> (Due to the amount of cropland in production, Texas, of course, has more potential acres to be in the CRP.)      
<p>
In 1993, Texas producers received $164 million in rental fees, and approximately $100 million in cost sharing from the inception of the program in 1986 to 1993 in return for taking more than 4 million acres out of production and converting it to grass. The average one-time cost share for establishing grass cover is $25 per acre. More than 80 percent of the CRP acreage is in the High Plains and Rolling Plains. Reduced erosion - an estimated 22 percent reduction on U.S. cropland since 1985 - is not the only benefit of the Conservation Reserve Program. Environmental benefits include improvement in air and water quality and an increase in wildlife habitat for game and nongame birds, mammals and reptiles. Soil conservation specialists in Terry and Lubbock counties report a noticeable reduction in wind erosion and change in air quality as well as an increase in wildlife since cropland has been enrolled in the CRP.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#24">(24)</A>  The Environmental Working Group notes that the CRP has saved the state 144.8 million tons of soil annually.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#25">(25)</A> 
<p>
The <I>Wall Street Journal </I>reports that the CRP program has its critics. The average age of landowners participating in the program is 64, leading some to believe that it is a "welfare plan" for retired farmers. Others complain that too much good farmland has been allowed in the CRP program. Meanwhile, there are residents of the Texas Panhandle who complain that taking 20 percent of the Plains farmland out of production has devastated related businesses, such as cotton gins and seed, pesticide and equipment dealers.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#26">(26)</A> There has also been criticism about the high cost of the CRP. CRP proponents suggest, however, if farmers who are currently enrolled in the CRP were growing rice, cotton, grains and other crops eligible for income supports, their deficiency payments would be equal to, if not more than, the CRP costs.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#27">(27)</A> In addition, the USDA estimates the CRP's environmental benefits at between $6 billion and $13 billion over the life of the contracts.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#28">(28)</A> 
<p>
Unless extended, the CRP program will begin to phase out in 1995. Much of the acreage now enrolled in the CRP will revert to row crop and forage production. A study conducted by Texas Tech University's Department of Agricultural Economics found that, in 55 counties in the Plains, economic considerations will encourage farmers to return 64 percent of the land to crop production unless the CRP is extended.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#29">(29)</A>  This is not just the prediction for Texas; according to the Soil and Water and Conservation Society the return of CRP land to production will occur nationwide.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#30">(30)</A> A revised CRP program that targets truly erodible land for inclusion might be presented to Congress in 1995.  
<p>
The other major erosion-abatement provision created by the 1985 Food Security Act is the Conservation Compliance Provision. This provision required farmers who had highly erodible land and who wanted to retain eligibility for government program benefits to implement a conservation plan and have it approved by the Soil Conservation Service by December 31, 1994.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#31">(31)</A>   
<p>
Conservation tillage is one good example of mature conservation practices.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#32">(32)</A>  According to the Conservation Technology Information Center, a not-for-profit organization that provides research on soil conservation, 22.4 percent (4,482,961 acres) of Texas cropland is in conservation tillage.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#33">(33)</A> Conservation tillage is expected to increase as a means to meet the requirements of the conservation compliance provision, but experts suggest that continued research is needed to better understand its effects and to determine which types of crops respond best.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#34">(34)</A>

	<LI><A NAME="24">The Soil</A> and Water Conservation Society reports that, since 1985, 36.5 million acres--about 8 percent of all U.S. cropland --has been enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Plan. The original enrollment target was 40 to 45 million acres. The direct costs for setting aside 36.5 million acres is estimated to be $19.2 billion over the life of the contracts. This does not include administrative costs or savings on commodity-price and income-support programs. Environmental benefits are estimated to be between $6 billion and $13.6 billion over the life of the contracts.

Deficiency payments are based on the difference between the target price and market price, which ever difference is less. The target price is set by Congress and the USDA. The target price is based on the national average cost of producing a crop. Farmers are eligible to receive a deficiency payment if the market price fails to reach the target price.

Though producers with highly erodible land must have a conservation plan under the conservation compliance policy by December 31, 1994, the conservation plan requirements do not require producers to take highly erodible land out of production. This issue will most likely be addressed in the 1995 Farm Bill.

Quality, Page 3</H5>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="NATIONAL">NATIONAL</A> AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
</H4>
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act contained other market-based approaches to pollution control. The EPA may now issue allowances to companies for the manufacture of chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that deplete atmospheric ozone even though the manufacture of these chemicals is being phased out. The Act also has provisions that allow one facility's reductions in ozone-forming pollutants or toxic chemicals to offset increased emissions at another facility. Texas has embraced several of these new market-based approaches in its effort to reduce pollution.
<P>
How these efforts will ultimately improve air quality is still unknown. The EPA says that 90 million Americans live in cities that are non-attainment for at least one of the six main air pollutants targeted by the Federal Clean Air Act.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#18">(18)</A> In addition, there are possible global problems -  such as ozone depletion and global warming -  which may defy strictly national solutions. Other "air" issues, such as indoor air pollution, are not addressed by the Federal Clean Air Act at all.
<P>
Moreover, none of the changes mandated by the law come cheaply. Industries large and small will feel the effects of the Federal Clean Air Act. For example, in areas of the state not meeting ozone standards, tough new emission standards will require businesses to install expensive pollution control equipment. These businesses will also have to apply for new federal operating permits. In some sectors, such as electric utilities and petroleum refineries, these requirements have already led to some job losses. Even small businesses like dry cleaners, bakeries and printers will have to install new equipment to control emissions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. Because the Federal Clean Air Act greatly expanded the scope of government regulation, the government's cost of monitoring and enforcing air-quality law has also increased.  
<P>
These anticipated economic impacts were the main source of opposition to the bill. Still, the Act will create new markets for alternative fuels, pollution control equipment and new services, thus creating new jobs. And supporters believe that the economic value of the Act's public-health benefits - measured in fewer sick days, hospitalizations and deaths - will more than offset initial economic costs.

With 18 million cars on its roads, 442 electric utility generators using gas, oil, coal and other sources of fuel, 60 percent of the nation's petrochemical production, 25 percent of the nation's refining capacity and a population of more than 18 million people, Texas must grapple with the full range of clean air issues. The state consistently ranks at or near the top of the list in air toxic emissions, reflective of the disproportionate amount of petrochemical production relative to the rest of the country. Half of the state's population lives in "non-attainment" cities, which do not meet federal standards for clean air.
<P>
This chapter discusses air quality in Texas, outlining the problems and summarizing the efforts to deal with it. It is divided into six sections:
<P>
<B><OL>
	<LI>  National Ambient Air Quality Standards
	<P>
	<LI>  Clean Air Act Compliance in Texas
	<P>
	<LI>  Other Air Quality Issues
	<P>
	<LI>  Mobile Sources
	<P>
	<LI>  Major Stationary Sources 
	<P>
	<LI>  Small Businesses and Minor Stationary Sources
</OL>
</B><P>
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Acts set forth air quality standards for six pollutants: ozone (03), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), respirable particulate matter (PM10) and lead (Pb). The Environmental Protection Agency has determined an allowable limit for each of these pollutants that is intended to protect the public from exposure to dangerous levels. These national standards are known as the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
<P>
One set of standards, called primary standards, is designed to protect human health. Another set, called secondary standards, is designed to protect the environment and limit property damage. Any area of a city that exceeds a standard causes the entire metropolitan area to be in violation. Since the EPA began regulating these pollutants, levels of all have declined. Most emissions have shown a modest decline. The exception is lead, which showed a sharp decline (90 percent) between 1982 and 1991. This dramatic reduction is due largely to the phase out of leaded gasoline which began in the 1970s. Today, the most abundant single pollutant is carbon monoxide, accounting for about 50 percent of total emissions by weight. 
<P>
At monitoring stations around the state, the four gaseous criteria pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO, and O3) are monitored continuously, with one-hour averages measured each hour, every day. PM10 and lead are measured at least once every six days for a 24-hour averaging period, although some sites in Texas are monitored more frequently. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, local governmental agencies and some private organizations monitor for criteria pollutants (see box in text on monitoring).

<A NAME="OZONE">A. OZONE</A>
</H4>
<P>
In the upper atmosphere, ozone (O3), an oxygen molecule with three, rather than two, oxygen atoms, forms a layer that filters out ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Concern about the thinning of the atmospheric ozone layer has led to bans on the use of certain chemicals, such as chlorinated fluorocarbons, that may destroy ozone. 
<P>
Though atmospheric ozone helps sustain life, ozone formed near the ground may adversely affect plants, animals and humans. Ozone is produced when reactive hydrocarbons known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) combine with nitrogen oxides in the presence of sunlight. Ozone problems are most common in the hot summer months because the warm air and sunlight speed ozone formation. 
<P>
Volatile organic compounds are emitted from a wide variety of sources. These include automobiles and other vehicles (referred to as "mobile sources" in the Federal Clean Air Act); refineries and chemical manufacturing plants ("major stationary sources"); paint shops and dry cleaners ("minor" or "area sources"); recreational boats, ships, barges, lawn and garden equipment, aircraft, and locomotives ("off-road mobile sources"); and plants and trees ("biogenics"). Yes, even trees contribute to VOCs (see box in text). Nitrogen oxide comes from some of the same sources - automobiles, boats, trains and planes, and refineries - as well as from service stations, home heating and cooling units, wastewater treatment plants, power plants and forest fires. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has estimated both the amount and the sources of VOCs and NOx released into the atmosphere in major Texas metropolitan areas.
<P>
<B>Non-Attainment Areas.</B>
<P>
Four metropolitan areas in Texas have exceeded the national standards for ozone often enough to be currently classified as non-attainment areas. They are: Houston/Galveston/Brazoria, Beaumont/Port Arthur, Dallas/Fort Worth and El Paso. The Houston/Galveston/Brazoria metropolitan area reports the highest numbers of days exceeding ozone standards in Texas. In general, Texas cities have shown a decline over the past 10 years in the number of days exceeding national standards. Other large Texas cities like Austin, San Antonio and Corpus Christi have met the ozone standard since the early 1980s. Still, in both 1993 and 1994, Corpus Christi exceeded the one-hour ozone standards on one occassion, and Austin and San Antonio approached it.
<P>
<B>Health and Environmental Effects of Ozone.</B>
<P>
High levels of ozone - including levels above the 0.125 parts per million standard - can have serious human health effects. Ozone reacts with lung tissue and can cause breathing problems. The risk of asthma may be increased and people may cough and have chest pains. For unknown reasons, about 10 to 20 percent of the population, sometimes referred to as "responders," is especially sensitive to high ozone concentrations. This group, along with people with pre-existing respiratory diseases and people who exercise outdoors, are particularly at risk from high ozone levels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#20">(20)</A> 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">A 1988 study for the American Lung Association estimated that if ozone standards had been met throughout the United States in 1983, 49.9 million cases of adverse health symptoms and 1.9 million asthma attacks would have been eliminated.

<P>
High ground levels of ozone can also have negative environmental effects. It is believed to affect crop and forestry production by damaging the cell walls of plants. In 1987, the East Texas Intensive Research Site was established near Nacogdoches to investigate how pollutants affect the development of one- to four-year-old short leaf pines along coastal plains. The study subjected some trees to persistent exposure to ozone and the trees showed loss of needles, stunted growth and fewer stems.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#21">(21)</A>

<tr><th>DO TREES POLLUTE?</th></tr>
<tr><td>
Do trees pollute? In the early 1980s, then-President Ronald Reagan and some noted scientists attracted attention when they confirmed that trees themselves are a possible source of some types of air pollution. Trees do contribute to the formation of ozone by releasing volatile organic compounds such as isoprene, monoterpene and alpha-pinene. 
<P>
Under Title 1 of the Federal Clean Air Act, states are required to estimate how much trees and plants contribute to VOC production for those areas that exceed ozone standards. The sources of these VOCs, known collectively as "biogenics," include forests, crops, lawn grasses and other vegetation. The more vegetation an area has, the more these biogenics will contribute to overall VOC levels. For example, biogenics are estimated to account for 22 percent of all VOCs emitted in the woody Houston/Galveston area, but only 12 percent in the arid El Paso area.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#19">(19)</A> Of course, biogenic sources are natural sources of air pollution and no one is suggesting that trees be cut to reduce pollution. In fact, the air quality benefits of biogenics far outweigh the costs since plants produce oxygen, filter the air and prevent erosion. Biogenic sources are not figured into the calculation of how much an area must reduce VOC emissions.

<A NAME="SULFUR">B. SULFUR DIOXIDE</A> AND NITROGEN OXIDES - THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF ACID RAIN
</H4>
<P>
Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are gases released when fossil fuels are burned. When these gases react with water in the atmosphere, sulfuric acid and nitric acids can form and fall as rain, commonly referred to as "acid" rain. In areas with little precipitation, the acids may become incorporated into dust and smoke and fall to the ground as "dry" acid.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#22">(22)</A> Acid rain can harm or kill fish by making lakes and rivers more acidic, i.e. by lowering the pH. It can also damage buildings, stone and monuments as well as crops and forests. Studies indicate that acid rain can also reduce crop yields both by damaging foliage and by causing minerals to leach from the soil.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#23">(23)</A>  While adverse affects have been reported in the Northeast, no harmful effects have been documented in Texas. This is because of two factors: 1) the strongly alkaline soils characteristic of much of the state; and 2) the absence of a snow pack melt common in more northern states.
<P>
Both nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide have been linked to the formation of acid rain and acidic lakes. Pinpointing the cause of acid rain is difficult, primarily because of multiple emission sources and complex meteorology. Rain can become acidic as a result of water reacting with nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. But other factors, such as acidic waste runoff and naturally high acidic levels in lakes or streams, may also contribute to acidity. In 1991, the Texas Air Control Board, later the TNRCC, and the federal government began monitoring the acidity (pH) of rain at 15 different sites. In general, the pH was lower - more acidic - in rainfall collected in East Texas.
<P>
Nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides have other harmful effects in addition to their ability to form acid rain deposition. At high levels, nitrogen oxides are known to cause lung damage and other respiratory illness, particularly in children and people suffering from asthma.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#24">(24)</A> In Texas, nitrogen dioxide has never exceeded the national standard set in 1973. It does, however, contribute to the formation of ozone (see previous section). 
<P>
High concentrations of sulfur dioxide in the air may cause difficulty in breathing and a choking sensation. Children, the elderly, asthma sufferers and people with chronic lung and heart disease are particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of sulfur dioxide. 
<P>
Unlike nitrogen oxide - which is mainly the result of automobile and utility emissions - sulfur dioxide is emitted chiefly from industrial sources like power plants using sulfur-containing fuel, metallic-ore smelting facilities, wood and paper industrial processors and oil and gas refineries. 
<P>
Sulfur dioxide levels in Texas vary across the state. The Houston/Galveston/Texas City area, the Beaumont/Port Arthur area, and the El Paso metropolitan area have shown the highest levels of SO2 measured in the state.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#25">(25)</A> While most areas in the state do not exceed or even approach the air quality standards for SO2, tests conducted between 1985 and 1989 by the Houston Regional Monitoring Network, a private organization, showed sulfur dioxide levels in excess of national standards 13 times in the industrial district of the Houston Ship Channel.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#26">(26)</A> Cooperative action between local industries, the TNRCC and the EPA has resulted in a voluntary reduction in SO2 emissions in the local area and no violations have been recorded since 1990.

<A NAME="CARBON">C. CARBON MONOXIDE</A>
</H4>
<P>
A colorless, odorless gas, carbon monoxide results from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, most often in motor vehicles and power plants. Carbon monoxide can interfere with the blood's ability to carry oxygen to the heart, brain and other tissues. People with heart disease and unborn or newborn children are especially susceptible to carbon monoxide poisoning.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#27">(27)</A> The area in Texas where the highest levels of CO are measured is El Paso, but even here, the NAAQS has not been exceeded more than 10 times per year. Carbon monoxide has also been identified as a possible precursor to the formation of ozone.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#28">(28)</A>
<P>
Unlike ozone, carbon monoxide levels usually rise with colder weather, when atmospheric conditions are more stable. In Texas, only El Paso has consistently exceeded the eight-hour standard for carbon monoxide concentrations. Most notably, however, levels measured in recent years are lower than those measured ten years ago. Dallas exceeded standards twice in 1985, while Houston exceeded standards nine times between 1974 and 1986. No other exceedences in these two cities have since been recorded due to state and federal efforts to control carbon monoxide emissions. According to the 1990 EPA data base, El Paso ranked 5th in the nation, behind Steubenville, Ohio; Provo, Utah; Los Angeles, California; and Las Vegas, Nevada for levels of eight-hour concentrations of carbon monoxide.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#29">(29)</A> However, 1994 data places El Paso behind eleven other U.S. cities.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#30">(30)</A>
<P>
El Paso is a special case because it shares a common airshed with Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, Mexico and is affected by that city's air pollution. A special section later in this chapter -  "Sharing Air Along the U.S. - Mexico Border" -  highlights some of these issues. In Texas, the levels and sources of carbon monoxide vary by location.

<A NAME="PARTICULATE">D. PARTICULATE MATTER</A>
</H4>
<P>
The category of air pollutant called "respirable particulate matter" includes liquids, hydrocarbons, soots, dusts, acids from aerosols and smoke particles that are smaller than 10 microns in diameter. This 10-micron size limit has led to the abbreviation of respirable particulate matter as "PM 10." These tiny particles make up about 55 percent of the total mass of suspended particles in air pollution, and come from the burning of fuels by industry, power plants and motor vehicles; from refuse incinerators; from dust created by construction, agriculture and unpaved roads; and from natural sources such as wind erosion.
<P>
While the nose can filter out larger particulates, PM10 can penetrate deep into the lungs. The further a particle penetrates and the higher the concentration, the more likely it is to cause wheezing, nose and throat irritation, bronchitis and lung damage. Chemicals such as toxic compounds attached to PM10 emissions can increase the potential for adverse effects. Groups at high risk include children, the elderly and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions like asthma and emphysema. Beyond these health hazards, PM10 reduces visibility and can discolor clothing and property.
<P>
In 1987, the Environmental Protection Agency revised its air quality standards for PM10, allowing a maximum of 150 micrograms per cubic meter on a 24-hour basis, or 50 micrograms per cubic meter as an annual average. Previously, the EPA had no specific standard for PM10, instead relying on a standard for all particulate matter, including particulate matter larger than 10 microns. The EPA estimates that adherence to these new standards will save 3,600 lives, reduce lost work days by 190,000 days and "reduced-activity" days, when people work less efficiently because of ill health, by 910,000 days.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#31">(31)</A>
<P>

Still there has been considerable debate about whether these levels adequately safeguard human health and some studies have suggested that standards should be strengthened.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#32">(32)</A> A recent study, which controlled for the effects of smoking, found that mortality risks are more strongly associated with concentrations of respirable particles and sulfates - the combination of sulfur dioxide with air - than with other common air pollution problems such as ozone or sulfur dioxide.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#33">(33)</A> 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF">Another study tracked 552,138 men and women across the United States from 1982 to 1989 and evaluated the effects of particulate air pollution - including sulfates and fine particulate matter less than 2.5 microns - on mortality. The study found an association between mortality due to cardiopulmonary diseases and particulate matter air pollution.
	<P>

Arden Pope III, Micheal Thun, Mohan Namboodiri, Douglas Dockery, John Evans, Frank Speizer and Clark Heath, Jr., "Particulate Air Pollution as a Predictor of Mortality in a Prospective Study of U.S. Adults," </I>American Journal of Respiratory Critical Care Medicine<I>, Vol. 151 (1995): 669 - 674.</I>
</UL>
<P>
While the EPA is currently reviewing the Federal PM10 standard, some states have already adopted a more stringent standard. For example, the state of California, after reviewing studies on morbidity and mortality from PM10 exposure, adopted a state air-quality standard for particulate matter of 50 micrograms over 24 hours. 
<P>
In Texas, only El Paso County has repeatedly exceeded both the 24-hour and annual standards set in 1987 for PM10. Other areas have occasionally exceeded this standard. In 1992, there were two exceedences out of 337 samples in El Paso. In 1993, there were none, while in 1994, there were two exceedences.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#34">(34)</A> In El Paso, particulate matter levels rise during winter months, due mainly to combustion of wood and other fuels for heating. 
<P>
El Paso is also impacted by particulate matter drifting from Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez in Mexico. Common sources of this particulate matter include unpaved roads and industrial combustion processes such as the incineration of garbage, including tires, without adequate controls. However, without adequate emissions inventories and ambient air quality monitoring in Ciudad Juarez to record air quality over time, it is difficult to determine if emissions are going down. TNRCC, the Environmental Defense Fund and others are working with Mexican environmental officials to address these needs.

<A NAME="LEAD">E. LEAD</A>
</H4>
<P>
Between 1982 and 1991, air emissions of lead in the United States were reduced from 52,000 to 5,000 tons per year, largely as a result of the country's phase-out of leaded gasoline.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#35">(35)</A> Nevertheless, lead continues to pose a public health threat, in part because of its persistence in the environment. Lead poisoning can lead to retardation in cognitive development in children, reduce mental ability and damage nerves and organs like livers and kidneys. It also may interfere with the creation of blood and raise blood pressure, leading to cardiovascular disease.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#36">(36)</A> Because lead accumulates in the body organs, bones and blood, even chronic exposure to small amounts can be harmful to both human and animal life. Besides leaded gasoline, sources of lead pollution in the air include metal smelters and the manufacture and reclamation of lead batteries. Children and pregnant women are most at risk from exposure to high lead levels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#37">(37)</A>
<P>
In Texas, outside air pollution from lead is now limited to a handful of areas. In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, citizens were concerned about the number of lead smelters and battery plants in the area, but most of these facilities were shut down in the mid-1980s. Suspected health problems from exposure to high lead levels continue to concern Dallas-area residents. However, monitors show no exceedences at this time. In the city of Frisco in Collin County, ambient air levels of lead have exceeded national standards in an area of approximately one-half mile near a major battery plant. However, the last exceedences for lead national standards were in 1987.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#38">(38)</A> Although lead exposure concerns had been raised over a 1.5-mile square surrounding an old battery reclamation plant in San Antonio, the site is currently designated as "unclassified" by the EPA until further monitoring can confirm the levels of lead in the air. 
<P>
In the early and mid-1980s, several monitoring sites in the city of El Paso violated national standards for lead. However, the closing of a lead smelter plant in 1985 and the phase-out of leaded gasoline have brought levels in El Paso to within the allowable limit since 1986. Generally speaking, lead is not a big problem in ambient air in Texas. Thus, there is a greater potential for lead exposure in individual households because of the possible presence of peeling lead-based paint.

<tr><th>AIR QUALITY MONITORING: HOW MUCH DO WE KNOW?
</th></tr><tr><td>
If you can't always see it, taste it, or maybe even smell it, how do you know air pollution is there? Texas' extensive monitoring network strives to answer that question by measuring concentrations of ambient air pollutants. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission operates more than 80 permanent monitoring sites located across the state. In addition, six local governmental entities and four private organizations monitor the six criteria pollutants at other stations in an effort to pinpoint local problems. Many of these stations also monitor air toxics. 
<P>
Despite the presence of these monitors in the major metropolitan areas, federal requirements and citizen concern about the health effects of toxics are generating a demand for more and better air-quality monitoring. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has invested about $1.5 million a year since 1992 to expand and operate its air toxics monitoring network. The agency plans to add 29 new toxic air monitoring stations by the end of 1995. Despite the large volume of toxics released each year into the air by Texas industries, ambient air toxics monitoring by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has not identified them as a significant public health risk.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#39">(39)</A> Air toxics selected for monitoring were those emitted in the largest quantities from multiple sources. While it is not possible to monitor for all chemical compounds emitted, the results of monitoring currently conducted are considered indicative of broad-based public exposure to other compounds by the TNRCC. Some monitoring methods collect average samples of toxics, and thus, higher peak concentrations would not be quantified, although they would be represented as part of the average itself.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#40">(40)</A> 
<P>
To complement its monitoring system, the TNRCC is investing in a more complete toxics monitoring network and expanding its use of mobile monitoring equipment, which includes a self-contained mobile laboratory, sampling vans and an air toxics response trailer.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#41">(41)</A>

<H5>Texas Environmental Almanac, Chapter 9, Industrial Waste, Page 1
</H5>

<A NAME="SINCE">Since</A> the industrial revolution, industrial and mining operations have been accompanied by a problem: industrial waste which may be toxic, ignitable, corrosive or reactive. If improperly managed, this waste can pose dangerous health and environmental consequences. In the United States, the amount of hazardous waste generated by manufacturing industries in the country has increased from an estimated 4.5 million tons annually after World War II to some 57 million tons by 1975.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#1">(1)</A> By 1990, this total had shot up to approximately 265 million tons.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#2">(2)</A> This waste is generated at every stage in the production process, use and disposal of manufactured products. Thus, the introduction of many new products for the home and office -  computers, drugs, textiles, paints and dyes, plastics - also introduced hazardous waste, including toxic chemicals, into the environment. These, too, must be managed with extreme care to avoid adverse environmental or human health impacts. The EPA estimated in 1980 that more than 70,000 different chemicals were being manufactured in the U.S., with some 1,000 new chemicals being added each year.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#3">(3)</A> The human health and environmental impacts of many of these chemicals are largely unknown.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#4">(4)</A> 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> <I>While tens of thousands of industrial chemicals are used in the United States and have the potential to enter the food supply through air, water and soil pollution, no law requires federal agencies to monitor environmental contaminants in food.</I>

</UL>
<P>
Before substantial state and federal regulation began in the late 1970s, most industrial waste was disposed of in landfills, stored in surface impoundments such as lagoons or pits, discharged into surface waters with little or no treatment or burned. Mismanagement of industrial as well as "hazardous" waste has resulted in polluted groundwater, streams, lakes and rivers as well as damage to wildlife and vegetation.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#5">(5)</A> Meanwhile, high levels of toxic contaminants have been found in animals and humans, particularly those, like farm workers and oil and gas workers, who are continually exposed to such waste streams.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#6">(6)</A> 
<P>
Today, three major federal laws and one state law guide management of hazardous waste and other industrial waste in Texas:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>  <B>Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act, </B>enacted in 1969 and last amended in 1993. This act authorizes a full state regulatory program for solid waste including industrial and hazardous waste under the jurisdiction of what today is called the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (formerly the Texas Water Commission). It sets out various permitting and enforcement authorities and restricts the location, design and operation of hazardous waste management facilities. 
	 <P>
	<LI>  <B> Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976</B>. As re-authorized in 1984 by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments, this federal law creates a step-by-step management approach restricting and controlling the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste onto the land; mandates a permitting system to assure the safe management of all hazardous waste; and implements a system to track hazardous waste as it moves "cradle-to-grave," from the point of generation to disposal. The 1984 amendments also banned hazardous waste which could threaten human health and the environment from land disposal without prior treatment. 
	 <P>
	<LI>  CERCLA, the Comprehensive Emergency Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, amended in 1986 as the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act (SARA). This federal law created a $1.6 billion "Superfund" to address spills of hazardous waste and clean up of old, abandoned hazardous waste sites.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#7">(7)</A> The Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act provided an additional $12.1 billion.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#8">(8)</A> Title III of SARA, the Emergency Planning and Community-Right-to-Know Act of 1986, requires major industries to report releases, transfers and recycling of toxic chemicals to the Environmental Protection Agency as part of the Toxics Release Inventory Program. 
	 <P>
	<LI>  Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, amended in 1986. This act, along with RCRA, protects groundwater sources of potable water and regulates underground injection of industrial and hazardous waste.

<H4>
<A NAME="WHAT">INDUSTRIAL</A> AND HAZARDOUS WASTE: WHAT IS IT?
</H4>
<P>
According to EPA estimates, manufacturing, mining and agricultural industries, along with commercial and domestic sources in the U.S., generate about 8 billion tons of waste each year, about 265 million tons of which were hazardous in 1990 under RCRA.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#9">(9)</A> That same year, municipal solid waste - what is picked up at our homes, businesses and institutions - made up only 196 million tons, or around 2.5 percent of all generated waste.
<P>
Industrial solid waste - which may be solid, liquid or gases held in containers - is divided into hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Hazardous waste may result from manufacturing or other industrial processes. Certain commercial products such as cleaning fluids, paints or pesticides discarded by commercial establishments or individuals can also be defined as hazardous waste. While RCRA does provide a general definition of hazardous waste, the hazardous waste "definition" has been further refined through regulations (see box). 
<H4>
<A NAME="NON">NON-HAZARDOUS</A> INDUSTRIAL WASTE
</H4>
<P>
Non-hazardous industrial waste are those that do not meet the EPA's definition of hazardous waste - and are not municipal waste. Waste determined to be hazardous are regulated by hazardous waste rules established pursuant to RCRA's Subtitle C requirements, while other non-hazardous waste fall under RCRA's Subtitle D solid waste management requirements. 
<P>
Under Texas regulations, non-hazardous waste generated by industrial facilities are categorized as Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3 waste (see box). Class 2 and Class 3 waste are considered less harmful to the environment or human health than Class 1 waste. While industries do have to report the type of waste they produce, they do not have to report how much of Class 2 and 3 waste they generate or how they dispose of them. However, municipal solid waste landfills do have to report the receipt of all industrial waste, including Class 2 and 3 waste.

<H4>
<A NAME="HIERARCHIES">INDUSTRIAL CHOICES</A>: HIERARCHIES OF INDUSTRIAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT
</H4>
<P>
As in the case of municipal solid waste, Texas and the EPA have created a hierarchy or a set of priorities for how best to manage industrial solid waste, whether non-hazardous or hazardous.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#64">(64)</A> In decreasing order of preference, these priorities are:
<P>
<OL>
	<LI>  Source Reduction;
	<P>
	<LI>  Reuse or Recycling of Waste;
	<P>
	<LI>  Treatment to Neutralize Hazardous Characteristics;
	<P>
	<LI>  Treatment to Reduce Hazardous Characteristics; 
	<P>
	<LI>  Underground Injection; and
	<P>
	<LI>  Land Disposal.
</OL>
<P>
Thus, never producing the waste is the top priority while land disposal is the least preferred alternative. Each of the methods used to dispose of waste presents challenges for the environment and human health. These challenges are reviewed in the remainder of the chapter. 
<P>
<B>Source Reduction and Waste Minimization</B>
<P>
The best means to get rid of waste is to reduce the amount generated at the source, a process known as source reduction. Waste minimization activities such as reusing and recycling seek to return the waste stream into a production process or alternative use, thus leading to both economic and environmental benefits. 
<P>
The source reduction and waste minimization approach - often called pollution prevention - has become popular in recent years. Traditional approaches to managing waste have relied on regulatory measures like RCRA, which set up management techniques to control waste at the "end-of-the-pipe." But these technologies are not fail-safe. Pollution may still occur. For example, studies showed that even the best clay-lined landfills eventually may fail and pollute groundwater.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#65">(65)</A> Newer plastic-lined landfills have experienced similar problems.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#66">(66)</A> And accidents may happen. Furthermore, using an incineration plant rather than a landfill just results in toxics being released into the air instead of the ground. Finally, public opposition to siting almost any type of hazardous waste commercial facility has significantly increased the costs and resources to build such facilities.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#67">(67)</A>
<P>
The pollution prevention approaches emphasize reducing the environmental and financial costs associated with managing hazardous waste. Pollution prevention is based on two concepts:
<P>
<OL>
	<LI>  The production of waste results in both loss of energy from the production process and loss of valuable resources; and
	 <P>
	<LI>  Once the waste is produced, money, manpower, and additional materials must be spent to manage the waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#68">(68)</A>

DEFINITIONS AND APPROACHES TO WASTE REDUCTION
</th></tr><tr><td>
<B>Source Reduction</B> as applied by Texas law means reducing the amount of any hazardous or non-hazardous substance entering any waste stream or released into the environment prior to recycling, treatment and/or disposal; 
<P>
<B>Waste Minimization</B> means a practice that reduces the environmental or health hazards associated with hazardous waste, pollutants or contaminants. Examples may include reuse, recycling, neutralization and detoxification. 
<P>
<B>Source Separation </B>keeps hazardous waste from non-hazardous waste, preventing all the waste from being managed as hazardous waste. It does not necessarily reduce the total volume of waste, only its hazardous components.
<P>
<B>Recycling and Re-use</B><I> </I>is the process of removing a substance from a waste and returning it to productive use. Recycling can happen at a plant, where the waste is re-used within the production process itself. Waste can also be recovered off-site. 
<P>
A third form of recycling is to send the waste to another industry through an inter-industry exchange. The most common materials recycled in Texas are used solvents, zinc and other metals and acids.
<P>
<B>Substitution of Raw Materials </B>replaces a raw material that results in hazardous waste with one that results in less hazardous waste or none at all.
<P>
<B>Manufacturing Process Changes </B>consist of either eliminating a process that produces waste or changing the process so that a waste is no longer produced.
<P>
<B>Substitution of Products </B>means eliminating the use of a hazardous material. For example, by substituting creosote-preserved wood posts with concrete posts, no hazardous waste will leach from the posts.

<B><A NAME="REDUCTION">Hazardous</A> Waste Reduction Programs in Texas</B>
<P>
Texas has relied on voluntary programs to encourage source reduction activities. These programs include:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>  Waste Reduction Policy Act of 1991. This act requires that facilities that generate more than 100 kilograms a month of hazardous waste or that release toxic chemicals under the Toxics Release Inventory Program develop: 1) a waste minimization and source reduction plan; 2) an executive summary of the plan which must be available for public viewing; and 3) an annual progress report. 
	 <P>
	By 1997, an estimated 10,000 companies must submit source reduction and waste minimization plans to the TNRCC.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#69">(69)</A> The largest 600 companies have already presented their plans, projecting that more than 36 millions tons of hazardous waste will not be generated by 1997 because of source reduction.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#70">(70)</A> While companies are required to submit the plans, how they choose to reduce pollution, and whether in fact they do at all, is strictly voluntary.
	<P>
	<LI>  Texas Clean Industries 2000. This voluntary program was begun in 1992. Industries which join this program commit to carry out a plan to reduce hazardous or toxic waste by 50 percent from 1987 levels by the year 2000.
	 <P>
	<LI>As of March, 1995, 132<B> </B>companies had joined the Texas Clean Industries 2000 program. Membership includes 29 of the top 50 hazardous waste generators. According to the TNRCC, these industries have pledged to reduce their 1987 levels of hazardous waste by 57 percent by the year 2000.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#71">(71)</A> This amounts to pledged reductions of 29 million tons of hazardous waste (or more than 20 percent of total hazardous waste generation).

	<LI>  In 1993, the state's voters approved a constitutional amendment known as <I>Proposition Two</I>, which grants property tax exemptions for pollution control equipment. The TNRCC is charged with implementing this program, which will allow companies installing pollution control equipment or making manufacturing process changes to submit an application to take this equipment off the tax rolls. One of the purposes of Proposition Two is to encourage voluntary source reduction programs through tax incentives (see box).
	 <P>
	 Through its Office of Pollution Prevention and Recycling, the TNRCC has instituted a variety of other source reduction and waste minimization programs including:

POLLUTION CONTROL TAXES IN TEXAS
</th></tr><tr><td>


In 1993, the Texas State Legislature and voters of Texas approved a constitutional amendment known as Proposition 2. This measure allows new property and equipment used for pollution control to be moved off the tax roles. With such a property-tax exemption, the state gives an incentive for companies to meet and in some cases go beyond environmental rules, regulations or statutes. 
<P>
Under rules adopted in 1994 to implement Proposition 2, companies can apply to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission to have pollution control property - a facility, device, or method used to control, reduce, measure or prevent pollution -  designated as such. Once such a positive determination is made, the company would then qualify for a property-tax exemption from the local tax assessor. The property must have been installed after January 1, 1994, thus keeping on the tax rolls any pollution control equipment previously subject to property taxes. Examples of new equipment eligible for a Proposition 2 exemption include a scrubber put on an industrial smokestack to meet rules under the Federal Clean Air Act; a dechlorination system in an industry's wastewater plant; or even a change in an industry's production process to prevent the release of a toxic chemical. 
<P>
Supporters of Proposition 2 - which included both small and large businesses and some environmental groups -  say the measure will promote voluntary compliance with environmental regulations while preserving jobs as the costs of doing business are lessened. Thirty-three other states offer similar incentives to businesses, and supporters argued that without the measure, industries might prefer locating in another state.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#77">(77)</A> Finally, many felt the proposal is fair since not having an exemption would put a financial burden on companies, forcing them both to add often expensive equipment because of federal and state regulations, as well as paying taxes on that equipment. 
<P>
Opponents, including some state environmental groups as well as local tax assessor associations, fear the proposal will result in a massive giveaway of property tax revenue to large corporations. Ultimately, they point out the tax breaks will be at the expense of local school districts, cities and special districts, particularly in the most industrialized areas of the state, such as Harris County, Jefferson County, Dallas/Fort Worth, Corpus 
<P>
Christi and El Paso. While environmental regu-lations can sometimes be costly, opponents of Proposition 2 argued that the law gives every business a tax break to comply with environmental laws, whether or not the business has demonstrated any economic hardship. Thus, opponents maintained that keeping the environment clean is quite simply a cost of doing business, and businesses should not be given incentives to merely comply with the law. 
<P>
In the program's first year, TNRCC approved 752 requests from companies to have their pollution control certified for a total of $1.1 billion dollars.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#78">(78)</A> Provided their local tax assessors concur with the valuation, industry in Texas will not have to pay property taxes on this equipment.

<B><A NAME="REUSE">Recycling and Reuse of Hazardous Waste</A></B>
<P>
A variety of industrial waste can be recycled for use as products. There are three ways in which industrial waste recycling occurs: at the facility itself (on-site recycling), at commercial facilities which gather waste streams from several companies (off-site recycling), and when the waste products from one company are used as inputs in the production process of another company. In 1991, for example, some 232,700 tons of hazardous waste were recycled on-site by major industries in Texas or at commercial recycling facilities. About 13 percent of all Texas-generated hazardous waste treated at commercial facilities was recycled in 1991.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#75">(75)</A> 
<P>
Most industrial recycling of hazardous waste involves three types of processes: solvent recovery; metals recovery; and other organic chemical recovery (including waste oil recovery and non-solvent organic recovery). The state has projected there will be a deficit in commercial capacity for some types of metal recovery such as mercury and zinc in 1995.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#76">(76)</A> In fact, in 1991, there were no zinc recovery facilities in Texas, while some 57,400 tons of zinc and zinc-constituent hazardous waste were exported to Mexico for recycling.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#79">(79)</A> 
<P>
Off-site recycling of some hazardous materials is difficult because of the dangerous nature of the chemicals themselves. Unlike some municipal waste such as aluminum which are fairly easy to recycle, some hazardous chemicals are prone to ignite and be reactive. In addition, the fear that industries have of accidents and spills during transportation or recycling operations - and the resulting liability -  can sometimes present an obstacle to the recycling of hazardous materials off-site.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#80">(80)</A>
<P>
Transportation costs to move a waste to another company for recycling purposes are another obstacle. For many products, it is far simpler to dispose of the waste on-site than to exchange it with another company or recycle it. 
<P>
There is also considerable debate about just what recycling is. Under Texas' Waste Reduction Policy Act, companies that burn their hazardous waste for energy recovery in boilers and industrial furnaces can count the waste as "recycled."
<P>
This approach has been criticized by some environmental groups who argue that using waste as fuel is really a method of disposal and pollution is often created in the burning of hazardous waste. In the Clean Texas Program, companies can meet part of their 50 percent reduction goal by burning waste to recover energy on-site; however, companies can not burn waste off-site in cement kilns or other off-site "waste-to-energy" plants to meet their reduction goals.
<P>
There are several key aspects of the Texas program for recycling of hazardous waste: 
<P>
In 1987, the Legislature created the Resource Exchange Network for Eliminating Waste (RENEW). This program aids in the recycling of waste by matching companies that have commodities, by-products, surplus materials or waste with other businesses that can use these same materials as process inputs. RENEW, run by the TNRCC, serves as an information clearinghouse, classifying waste by categories. In 1990, RENEW helped 14 companies disposing industrial solid waste negotiate a transfer to those using them for production, for a total of 416 tons.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#81">(81)</A> In Fiscal Year 1993, RENEW helped negotiate 23 transfers of industrial solid waste, totaling 202,291 tons.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#82">(82)</A> In all, 140 exchanges have been made, saving $679,000 in disposal costs.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#83">(83)</A>
<P>
In addition, the Office of Pollution Prevention and Recycling at TNRCC has assisted companies with on-site visits and workshops to push for recycling as well as source reduction. A special focus has been helping businesses develop in-house recycling programs. 
<P>
<B>Innovative Technology: Neutralizing and Destroying Hazardous Characteristics of Hazardous Waste</B>
<P>
A variety of new and emerging technologies can neutralize and, in some cases, even destroy the hazardous characteristics of industrial waste. One new encouraging technology is known as supercritical water oxidation. The process is simple, but expensive. Water is heated, pressurized and mixed with organic compounds, which dissolve. Later, oxygen gas is added to the mix and harmful substances are burned away. What's left is harmless. This gigantic pressure cooker, unfortunately, is very expensive, although a team at the University of Texas at Austin has developed a working water oxidizer.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#84">(84)</A> 
<P>
Other technologies currently being used in the Texas market include:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>  <B>Bio-remediation. </B>This process uses microorganisms bred to have an appetite for hydrocarbons to "eat" oil spills. One firm in Texas has also developed a strain of bacteria that has also demonstrated success consuming heavy metals.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#85">(85)</A>
	 <P>
	<LI>  <B>Carbon adsorption. </B>This is a process in which toxic substances adhere to a specially treated carbon surface.
	 <P>
	<LI>  <B>Dechlorination. </B>This process chemically replaces chlorine with hydrogen or hydroxide ions, leaving chlorinated substances non-toxic.
	 <P>
	<LI>  <B>Neutralization. </B>This process either makes an acid substance less so by adding alkaline substances, or makes a basic substance more acidic by adding acid. 
	 <P>
	<LI>  <B>Oxidation. </B>This process adds oxygen to substances such as sulfurs, phenols or cyanides, rendering them non-hazardous. 
	 <P>
	<LI>  <B>Precipitation. </B>This process separates solids from a liquid waste so that the solid portion can be managed more safely. 
	 <P>
	<LI>  <B>Vitrification. </B>This refers to any process which uses electricity to encase products in glass. For example, electric currents can be introduced into contaminated soils at such high voltages that the soil "turns" to glass.

<A NAME="RADIOACTIVE">RADIOACTIVE</A> WASTE
</H4>
<P>
Since the splitting of the atom, both uranium and plutonium have been used to create bombs, provide medical supplies and furnish energy. Not surprisingly, these uses create waste management problems: what do you do with materials which stay radioactive for tens of thousands of years? The disposal of most radioactive materials is regulated under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, as well as by a radioactive material licensing program established by the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978. While some states are subject to direct control by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Texas also has its own laws and regulations relating to the use of radioactive materials and radioactive waste disposal. Radioactive waste can be divided into four categories (see box).
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> <I>Nickel-59, a low-level radioactive waste, has a half-life of 75,000 years - in 75,000 years it will be half as radioactive as today - and will stay radioactive for upwards of 750,000 years. Humans in their present form have roamed the earth for 100,000 years.

<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=3 WIDTH="95%"><TR><th>WHAT IS RADIOACTIVE WASTE?
</th></tr><tr><td>
<B>Low-Level Radioactive Waste: </B>All tools, instruments, pipes, syringes, paper, water, soils and protective clothing such as gloves contaminated with radioactive materials can be considered low-level radioactive waste. Definitions vary by state; nationwide, the standard is any radioactive waste less than 100 nanocuries per gram of transuranics. Nationwide, about 80 percent of low-level radioactive waste by volume is from nuclear power plants. Low-level "fuel-related" radioactive waste such as sludges, resins and evaporator bottoms from cleaning the large volumes of water used at nuclear power reactors, and clothes, paper and filters contaminated by radioactive waste make up one category of nuclear-generated waste. Low-level "neutron-activated waste" from the intense bombardment of reactor parts with radioactive neutrons is a second category of low-level radioactive waste. Finally, hospitals and other medical facilities also produce low-level radioactive waste.
<P>
There is a significant difference between the hazards associated with different types of low-level radioactive waste. While medical waste remains hazardous for less than an average of eight months, low-level radioactive waste from nuclear power plants can remain radioactive for thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#16">(16)</A> About 1.4 million cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste were disposed of in the U.S. in 1991 - enough to fill about 280 box-cars.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#17">(17)</A> The last existing U.S. commercial low-level radioactive dump site (in South Carolina) closed in July of 1994.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#18">(18)</A> 
<P>
<B>High-Level Radioactive Waste:</B> Radioactive material that results from the reprocessing of nuclear fuel; from spent fuel rods removed from nuclear power reactor (a machine that splits atoms to make radioactive heat to boil water used for electricity generation); and from nuclear weapons. High-level radioactive waste is currently being stored on-site at weapon manufacturing plants and power plants around the nation until a permanent disposal site can be located.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#22">(22)</A>
<P>
<B>Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material</B>: Uranium and phosphate mining and a number of other industrial activities also generate mountains of radioactive waste referred to as "tailings," which are one example of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (NORM). Tailings are the radioactive soil and sand left on the ground after uranium ore has been crushed and processed for its radioactivity. These waste contain uranium and radium as well as a number of toxic chemicals. Increased incidence of cancer in some mine workers has been associated with their exposure to these waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#23">(23)</A>
<P>
In addition, coal power production, oil and gas exploration and production, fertilizer production and water treatment can all produce NORM waste. For example, the insides of oil extraction pipes may be coated with radium, or radium may be brought up to the surface while drilling for oil.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#24">(24)</A> NORM waste are managed apart from other radioactive and toxic waste.

<H4><A NAME="DISPOS">DISPOSAL</A> AND GENERATION OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE
</H4><P>
In Texas, low-level radioactive waste associated with power plants, industries, hospitals and research connected with the University of Texas System and mining amounts to about 20,000 cubic feet per year.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#10">(10)</A> By volume, about a third of this low-level radioactive waste comes from Texas' two nuclear power reactors: the South Texas Project in Matagorda County, and the two-unit Comanche Peak Project in Somervell County.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#11">(11)</A> 
<P>
By the amount of radioactivity - as measured in a radioactivity scale known as curies - nuclear power plants account for at least 70 percent of the state's low-level radioactive waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#12">(12)</A> While most waste produced in Texas stays radioactive less than 100 years, about 1 percent - again associated with power plants - will remain hazardous for thousands and even hundreds of thousands of years.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#13">(13)</A>
<P>
Federal and state definitions differ. In Texas, low-level radioactive waste includes radioactive waste that has a half-life of 35 years or less and fewer than 10 nanocuries per gram of transuranics, as well as waste with half-lives of more than 35 years if special criteria for the disposal of the waste are established by the TNRCC.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#14">(14)</A> These special criteria have been met by the TNRCC for some waste. The federal definition is more lenient since it considers any radioactive waste that has less than 100 nanocuries per gram low-level.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#15">(15)</A> In 1995, the Texas Legislature considered changing Texas regulations so that state and federal definitions of low-level radioactive waste would be the same.

Texas' nuclear plants - as well as many of the universities and industries - sent their waste to a low-level radioactive facility in Barnwell, South Carolina until July of 1994, when the facility closed. Since the closing of the facility, the two nuclear plants have stored their nuclear waste on-site in above-ground facilities, while hospitals and universities have either stored it on-site or sent it to a centralized storage facility in Fort Stockton.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#19">(19)</A> 
<P>
A proposed compact between Texas, Vermont and Maine contemplates the disposal of low-level radioactive waste from these three states in a proposed underground cement bunker landfill in Hudspeth County, Texas, seven miles from the town of Sierra Blanca. In 1981, the Texas Legislature created the Low Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority to develop a state site to manage LLRW. In 1992, the Waste Disposal Authority approved the Hudspeth County site. The site must be permitted by the TNRCC before it can begin operation, scheduled for 1996. If permitted, it would take waste for 30 years, although under the compact the state would maintain supervision for 100 years. 
<P>
Proponents of the site include state and university officials, the utility industry and others. They argue that it would be far superior than the present policy of storing the waste on-site at locations throughout the state, with limited state supervision.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#20">(20)</A> The areas where low-level radioactive waste are presently being stored tend to be more prone to flooding and natural disasters, raising the possibility that radioactive waste could leach from the storage areas. Finally, proponents point out that the Hudspeth County site is technologically superior to any site presently operated in the country. 
<P>
Local and state environmental groups have opposed the project on several grounds. They argue that nuclear power plants should store their own waste in above-ground storage units because it would prevent traffic mishaps and make power plants themselves responsible. A centralized storage facility could take care of less-radioactive industrial and university waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#21">(21)</A> Other stated reasons for the groups' opposition include concerns related to the geologic stability of the proposed site, which lies near aquifers Texas shares with Mexico, how large it needs to be and whether, if it is the first new low-level waste site in the U.S., it will eventually have to take waste from around the country. 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> <I>Only 1.4 million cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste was generated in 1990 nationwide, while experts of the nuclear waste disposal industry in the late 1970s were predicting as much as 5 million cubic feet by that date.

</UL>
<P>
In addition to low-level radioactive waste, Texas' two nuclear power plants also produce spent fuel rods and other high-level nuclear waste, which is stored in pools of water at the reactors. By 1990, the nation's nuclear plants had produced more than 20,000 tons of high-level radioactive waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#25">(25)</A> In addition, while taking apart the nation's nuclear arsenal, tons of plutonium will be stored at the Pantex nuclear weapons plant some 16 miles northeast of Amarillo. About 2,000 nuclear weapons will be dismantled there each year and stored at the plant site.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#26">(26)</A>
<P>
Other radioactive waste such as those generated by uranium mining, phosphate mining, oil and gas production and many other industries are not proposed to go to the LLRW site. These materials have not received the attention or regulation that other radioactive waste have. 
<P>
Uranium is used by the nuclear power industry. Texas has been a leading producer of this mineral, which can also be used to make nuclear weapons. Uranium used to be strip-mined much like coal mining. This mining process results in "tailings," left over radioactive material from the processing of uranium, as well as the need for the remediation of areas that have been mined. These tailing materials have been placed in ponds, which often have neither natural nor synthetic liners. Some ponds have leaked, contaminating soils and subsurface aquifers, as well as emitted radioactive gases into the atmosphere.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#27">(27)</A>
<P>
While no uranium strip-mines are currently operating in Texas, three companies are involved in reclamation projects at five different uranium mining sites.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#28">(28)</A> In addition, four tailing ponds in Karnes and Live Oak Counties are being closed and covered to prevent further contamination of subsurface aquifers or radioactive waste emissions. Three of the sites - run by Chevron, Exxon and Conoco - are being supervised by the TNRCC, while the Department of Energy is supervising clean up of a fourth tailing pond in an area which produced uranium for the defense industry.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#29">(29)</A>
<P>
Recently in Texas, uranium mining has been limited to 22 sites which use injection wells rather than a uranium strip mining operation. The injection process does not result in tailings. However, only two of these sites were mining as of September 1994, with the others closing down operations as the demand for uranium decreased.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#30">(30)</A> These "in-situ" or "solution" mines are considered by state agency regulators to present less environmental problems than strip-mines because liquids are pumped underground to dislodge uranium which is then pumped out through wells. Temporary settling ponds which store water, sand and precipitate and drilling liquids must be lined, but not covered.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#31">(31)</A> However, spills, accidents and leaks can still occur at such facilities. 
<H4>
<A NAME="WHY">WHY DO</A> WE CARE ABOUT HAZARDOUS WASTE?

<P>
Over the last five years, Texans and their industries have produced at least 60 million tons of hazardous waste every year.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#32">(32)</A> Although there are plenty of places to put our industrial waste, none of the management or disposal alternatives is fail-safe. Among state officials and the public, serious concerns about both commercial management of industrial waste and on-site industrial management of waste remain:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>  Hazardous and many "non-hazardous" industrial waste are inherently dangerous to human health and the environment no matter how they are managed;

	 <P>
	<LI>  Abandoned oil and gas and water wells located near a hazardous waste injection well might provide possible avenues for hazardous waste injected underground to seep up to the surface or into underground drinking water supplies;<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#35">(35)</A>
	 <P>
	<LI>  The specific health effects of many toxic substances are not well understood, and past experience with toxics such as dioxin has shown us that some toxic chemicals can accumulate in the environment for many years before their worst effects are revealed.
	 <P>
	<LI>  The continued disposal of "non-hazardous" industrial waste at both municipal solid waste landfills and industrial solid waste facilities and at oil and gas exploration and production sites is not as highly regulated as hazardous waste disposal. In fact, municipal solid waste landfills are more highly regulated than non-hazardous industrial solid waste disposal sites, which often do not require permits, groundwater monitoring, liners or leachate collection systems despite the dangerous waste they may contain. 
	 <P>
	<LI>  Thousands of abandoned industrial waste sites in Texas will require public management and clean-up well into the 21st century.

<H4>
<A NAME="PRODUCES">INDUSTRIAL</A> SOLID WASTE IN TEXAS: WHO PRODUCES IT?
</H4>
<P>
Historically, Texas has ranked first in the nation in total hazardous waste generated, due to the state's large size and industrial base.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#36">(36)</A> Industries in Texas reported producing between 60 and 65 million tons of hazardous waste each year between 1986 and 1990. However, a new EPA rule known as the Toxicity Characteristic rule caused many waste that were previously considered non-hazardous to also be defined as hazardous. For example, the rule made large volumes of wastewater stored in surface impoundments and holding ponds subject to regulation as hazardous waste if they contained toxic levels of certain chemicals such as benzene, lead and arsenic. The new rule forced industries to discontinue the use of surface impoundments for holding and treating these large volumes of waste, and begin treating them in wastewater treatment tanks and facilities. Because of this rule, which expands the universe of waste considered dangerous, the amount of hazardous waste from 1990 to 1991 doubled.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#37">(37)</A> By 1993, preliminary data showed that Texas industries generated about 180 million tons of hazardous waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#38">(38)</A>
<P>
Thus, in 1991, while 17 million Texans discarded about 21 million tons of municipal waste in the state, some 7,000 businesses, commercial institutions and industries produced 139 million tons of "hazardous" waste. These economic sectors - along with the oil and gas exploration and development industry -  also produced another 103 million tons of Class 1, "non-hazardous" waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#39">(39)</A> Finally, solid waste generators were not required to report millions of tons of Class 2 and Class 3 industrial waste to the TNRCC, although municipal solid waste facilities were required to report any reception of these waste.
<P>
In 1992, Texas led the nation in the amount of toxic chemicals released on-site and transferred off-site. This information is from the Toxic Release Inventory Program, which requires major manufacturing companies to report to the Environmental Protection Agency their toxic releases and transfers (see box).<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#40">(40)</A>
<P>
In 1991, more than 80 percent of the industrial hazardous waste generated in Texas was from facilities in Harris, Galveston, Brazoria, Nueces and Harrison counties.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#41">(41)</A> By 1993, these five counties still accounted for 80 percent of all hazardous waste generated (see <I>Counties </I>section for a full list).<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#42">(42)</A> Most hazardous waste in Texas is generated by two industrial sectors: petroleum refining and chemicals and allied products. For example, in 1987, these two industrial classifications accounted for 76 percent of all waste generated. By 1991, they accounted for more than 93 percent.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#43">(43)</A> Most of the increase is due to the new wastewater rule since these industries produce large volumes of wastewater.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#44">(44)</A> 
<P>
The top 25 producers of hazardous waste in Texas generated about 90 percent of all hazardous waste in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#45">(45)</A> It should be noted that volume - how much you produce - does not necessarily correspond to how hazardous the waste stream is to human health and the environment. Some methods of disposal and some types of hazardous waste are potentially more damaging than others.

<A NAME="SAFELY">INDUSTRIAL</A> SOLID WASTE: WHERE TO SAFELY PUT IT?
</H4>
<P>
Industrial solid waste can be managed either on-site - at the facility where it is generated - or off-site at commercial facilities. Whether on-site or off-site, industrial solid waste can be disposed of through the use of municipal and industrial wastewater facilities; land disposal facilities such as landfills, waste pits - principally for petroleum exploration waste - and deep underground injection wells; and incineration or waste-to-energy facilities like cement kilns. A variety of treatment, recycling and other management options also exist for many types of industrial waste. 
<P>
About 96 percent of hazardous waste and 99 percent of Class 1 waste were managed on site (at the facility where the waste is generated) in 1991. The majority of on-site management is through wastewater treatment facilities, which consist of storage and treatment tanks as well as more complex wastewater treatment.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#46">(46)</A> Once the level of hazardous waste is decreased to a certain level by treatment, the water is then discharged, either through a publicly-owned (wastewater) treatment works or from the industrial facility itself. Besides on-site waste-water facilities, most of the other waste managed on-site was injected underground into deep wells.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#47">(47)</A>

<I>Maquiladoras</I> are manufacturing plants located in Mexico which import at least 75 percent of their raw materials, assemble them in Mexico and export a finished product, usually to the U.S. In 1991, 673 <I>maquiladoras </I>were located along the Texas-Mexico border.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#53">(53)</A> Most of these <I>maquiladoras </I>are at least partially owned by U.S. corporations and use U.S. raw materials to make products such as semiconductors, electronic components, chemicals and auto parts. 
<P>
Under both Mexican law and a U.S.-Mexico agreement, the waste from production must also be returned to the country from which the raw materials were imported.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#54">(54)</A> Despite this requirement, however, Texas commercial facilities reportedly only treated 1,800 tons of hazardous waste from Mexico in 1991.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#55">(55)</A> While little is known about the actual amount of hazardous waste generated in maquila plants, evidence suggests that the volume of hazardous waste is many times higher than what is returned. The World Bank, for example, estimated that 80 percent of the hazardous waste is not repatriated, but remains stored on-site or is otherwise illegally disposed of in Mexico.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#56">(56)</A>
<P>
A new hazardous waste tracking system, called HAZTRAKS, was implemented in 1993 by the Environmental Protection Agency to better track how much hazardous waste was being imported from Mexico and to also help determine if hazardous waste regulations were being violated. The computer system uses the "cradle-to-grave" hazardous waste manifests to record the waste from its initial generation and transport to its disposal. EPA officials are sent manifests from U.S. Customs about a week after the shipments cross the border, while the final manifests finally reach HAZTRAKS some six months after the border crossing. In addition, Mexico has provided information to the system from its import and export guides filed by companies with its government.
<P>
Mexico also currently has a ban on the import of hazardous waste for disposal. However, the country does allow the import of waste if it is used to recycle or recover valuable materials. For example, cement kiln facilities are allowed to import hazardous waste if they use it to help power their production process. This recycling exemption on the ban of hazardous waste is controversial. In 1991, Texas industries shipped about 25,224 tons of hazardous waste to commercial management facilities for recycling in Mexico.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#57">(57)</A>

WHAT ARE "TOXICS" AND WHERE DO THEY GO?
</th></tr><tr><td>
All major manufacturing industries must report their releases and transfers of more than 300 individual toxic chemicals and 20 toxic chemi-cal compounds - chemicals which have been determined to be harmful to humans and/or the environment - to both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. Of these specific chemicals, 123 are defined as carcino-gens based on work-place standards, while chemicals like ozone depleters may affect the environment more directly than humans.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#60">(60)</A> 
<P>
Texas facilities released 381 million pounds of these toxic chemicals in 1993 to the air, water and land -- both above and below the ground -- while transferring another 91 million pounds to other authorized facilities for treatment, storage and disposal.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#61">(61)</A> Texas is the second largest volume producer of toxic chemical releases and the largest producer of releases and transfers in the country.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#62">(62)</A> However, it should be noted that Texas is also the second largest state in terms of population, and has the largest concentration of certain types of industries such as chemicals and petroleum refining. 
<P>
From 1987 to 1993, Texas showed a 23.2 percent reduction in on-site releases and off-site transfers.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#63">(63)</A> In fact, Texas industries have reduced toxic productions faster than industries in other states. However, interpreting these numbers is difficult. Each year there are a different number of facilities reporting. The amount of toxic releases and transfers is affected by the amount of production and general economic conditions. Still, most major companies have significantly reduced toxic releases over the last five years (see section on waste minimization and source reduction).

<A NAME="EXPORTS">EXPORTS</A>, IMPORTS AND COMMERCIAL TREATMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE
</H4>
<P>
Only 4 percent of hazardous waste in Texas was treated off-site in 1991. That year, 4,414,400 tons of hazardous waste were treated at domestic wastewater facilities; 470,000 tons were treated at commercial facilities in Texas; 315,300 tons were sent out-of-state to commercial facilities; and another 201,300 tons went to other "captive" facilities owned by the same company.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#48">(48)</A> More than 40 percent of Texas-generated hazardous waste which went to commercial treatment facilities was exported to other states.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#49">(49)</A> Texas imported about the same amount of hazardous waste as it exported. Most of the imported hazardous waste went to commercial deep-well injection facilities.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#50">(50)</A>
<P>
In addition to these hazardous waste, in 1991 Texas facilities sent 613,700 tons of Class 1 non-hazardous waste - out of 103 million tons generated - to commercial facilities.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#51">(51)</A> There are just a few facilities in the state which manage only non-hazardous industrial waste commercially. For example, 398,000 tons of industrial waste were sent to either in-state or out-of-state landfills in 1991.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#52">(52)</A> Contaminated soils and solids, asbestos materials and PCB contaminated materials made up about 67 percent of the "non-hazardous" industrial waste. Most of the remainder was shipped to a commercial injection well.
<P>
Is there enough space available to take care of all of these waste? In most cases, yes. In a 1994 report on commercial capacity, the TNRCC found that there would be sufficient space to manage Texas waste in 1995, except in the following categories:
<P>

The report found that Texas was lacking in some technologies to recycle and destroy hazardous waste, yet (with the exception of landfilling) had enough disposal capacity for waste that can't be destroyed or recycled. It also noted that a limited number of facilities may be available nationally to manage these waste streams.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#58">(58)</A> In late 1994, a new hazardous waste landfill in Andrews County was permitted, which should provide additional capacity by 1996.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#59">(59)</A>

<B><A NAME="BURNING">Reducing Hazardous Characteristics of Waste: Burning</A></B>
<P>
Incineration is preferred to landfilling and underground injection in the state's hazardous waste management hierarchy. It reduces and may, in some cases, eliminate hazardous characteristics of waste. In the case of waste-to-energy facilities, it may also provide energy for use in other production processes. However, the burning of hazardous waste in incinerators, boilers and industrial furnaces (BIFS) and in cement kilns - which burn waste to produce cement - increases the amount of toxics released to the air (see <I>Air </I>chapter). In addition, the ash produced by burning hazardous waste may still be a threat to human health and the environment because it may contain such compounds as lead, uranium and arsenic. Finally, the variety of waste streams received at commercial incineration facilities makes it harder to control the burning process, leading to problems with explosions and toxic plumes.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#86">(86)</A> For these reasons, a number of citizen-based and environmental groups in Texas have been vocally opposed to both the current operation of hazardous waste burning facilities as well as permitting additional facilities.
<P>
In the past, some facilities mixed hazardous waste or used oil with fuel to augment the heating value of fuels and reduce waste disposal costs, while at the same time avoiding regulation of waste disposal.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#87">(87)</A> Until 1986, some utilities, industries, commercial facilities, schools, government institutions and apartment and home owners across the country used hazardous waste and used oil for energy recovery purposes.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#88">(88)</A> Today, non-industrial facilities - homes, apartments, schools - are not allowed to burn hazardous waste or used oils containing toxics. Industrial facilities using hazardous waste or used oil must comply with certain standards and register with both the EPA and the state.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#89">(89)</A> 
<P>
In 1991, more than one million tons of hazardous waste were incinerated or burned for energy or thermal recovery at on-site boilers and industrial furnaces and industrial facilities in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#90">(90)</A> An additional 200,000 tons were burned at commercial facilities. There is an increasing reliance on the burning of waste; 28 percent of Texas-generated hazardous waste processed and treated off-site was burned.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#91">(91)</A>
<P>
Incineration has increased in Texas in large part because of imports of hazardous waste from out-of-state facilities as well as an increase in commercial capacity at cement kilns.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#92">(92)</A> There has also been an increase in demand as a result of the federal land disposal rules, which require treatment of hazardous waste before land disposal. As land disposal has decreased, incineration and deep-well injection of waste have increased. Hazardous waste imported from out-of-state industries for incineration by Texas facilities increased from 31,000 to nearly 65,000 tons between 1989 and 1991.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#93">(93)</A>
<P>
There are currently two commercial cement kilns that use hazardous waste fuels operating in Midlothian, in Ellis County, as well as 32 permitted hazardous waste incineration facilities throughout the state.
<P>
Despite their similarities, cement kilns currently do not have to meet the same standards as commercial waste incinerators.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#94">(94)</A> Cement kilns are currently operating under interim regulations which permit them to burn liquid hazardous waste in proximity to populations without the same safety and monitoring standards as commercial incinerators. For example, the plants in Midlothian are located upwind of population centers and near prime agricultural areas. A state task force has recommended applying the same standards to all commercial facilities, including cement kilns, which burn hazardous waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#95">(95)</A>
<P>
Incinerator and cement kiln operators are facing new environmental hurdles which will make their operations more costly. First, the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act is requiring these operators to install costly pollution control equipment to bring toxic air emissions into compliance (see <I>Air</I> chapter). 
<P>
Second, in 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that incinerator ash -  what remains after either industrial or municipal waste is burned -  must be tested to determine if it's hazardous. Incinerator ash can contain some amounts of toxic metals such as lead, arsenic and cadmium. Previously, incinerator ash resulting from the burning of waste at hazardous waste incinerators was defined as hazardous waste, while ash that resulted from municipal solid waste incinerators or cement kiln incinerators did not have to be managed as hazardous waste. Now, all ash found to be hazardous will have to be managed as hazardous waste. The ruling will prevent the current practice of disposing of incinerator ash from the cement kiln industry in quarries. Costs could increase significantly for both municipal waste burners and cement kilns using hazardous waste fuels (see <I>Municipal Waste</I> chapter for more details).<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#96">(96)</A>

<B><A NAME="UNDERGROUND">Underground Injection of Hazardous Waste</A></B>
<P>
The state's fifth-preferred method of managing hazardous waste is disposal in underground injection wells. The disposal of waste in deep geological formations is controversial. Texas officials believe injection wells, when operated correctly, are safe; however, many environmental groups are concerned about the heavy reliance on this technology, particularly the commercial facilities which must manage a wide variety of hazardous waste. Texas injects more liquid hazardous waste underground than any other state.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#97">(97)</A>
<P>
In the 1930s, oil and gas exploration and production companies began injecting saltwater by-products back into the oil-producing underground strata. The first manufacturing industry to use this same technique to inject industrial hazardous waste underground in Texas was DuPont, which began a waste injection operation in 1953. Most underground injection wells in Texas inject the waste into oil-producing formations.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#98">(98)</A> 
<P>
The 1984 amendments to RCRA prohibited land disposal, including underground injection, of certain types of hazardous waste without pre-treatment. However, if an operator of the injection well can prove the waste will not migrate from the injection zone for 10,000 years, the company can inject hazardous waste into wells without pre-treatment. 
<P>
Texas regulates the injection of hazardous waste through permits. About 200 permits to operate injection wells disposing of hazardous or non-hazardous waste have been granted in Texas since 1961; 117 of these wells are currently permitted.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#99">(99)</A> Most are located in the coastal area and dispose of waste associated with the petrochemical industry; nine of these 117 are commercial facilities. 
<P>
In 1991, almost 15 million tons of hazardous waste - about 11 percent of all hazardous waste generated -  were injected underground in Texas, mostly at on-site facilities owned by companies.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#100">(100)</A> In addition, about 12,500 injection wells used for oil and gas waste are currently permitted by the Railroad Commission of Texas to inject millions of tons of saltwater and other waste underground (see <I>Water</I> <I>Quality</I> chapter for a full discussion).<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#101">(101)</A> 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> <I>Hazardous waste must be in liquid form before it can be injected underground. Of the 11.5 billion gallons of hazardous waste injected nationwide in 1983, EPA estimates that only 4 percent by weight were toxic contaminants; the remainder was water.</I> 
	<P>
	<I>Source: General Accounting Office, </I>Hazardous Waste: Controls Over Injection Well Disposal Operations <I>(Washington, DC: U.S. General Printing Office, 1987), 11.</I>
</UL>
<P>
Experts and local state officials agree that waste disposal through properly constructed and operated injection wells is safer and less likely to contaminate surface water or potable groundwater than are landfills and other forms of land treatment.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#102">(102)</A> For example, injection of hazardous waste into aquifers that serve or could serve as groundwater supplies for communities is not allowed. However, there are several pathways by which waste injected underground could contaminate water resources:<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#103">(103)</A>
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>  Injection of waste above aquifers containing drinkable water;
	 <P>
	<LI>  Leakage of waste through inadequate confining beds;
	 <P>
	<LI>  Leakage of waste through confining beds due to hydraulic fracture or faults;
	 <P>
	<LI>  Displacement of saline water into a potable aquifer;
	 <P>
	<LI>  Upward migration of waste liquid from the injection zone along the outside of well casing;
	 <P>
	<LI>  Escape into potable aquifers due to well-bore failures; and 
	 <P>
	<LI>  Vertical migration and leakage to land and aquifers through abandoned oil, gas and other wells.
</UL>
<P>
Because the areas in which deep well injection of hazardous waste is practiced in Texas are precisely those areas with a long history of oil and gas production, there are many possible routes for vertical migration of hazardous waste to the surface. State and federal regulations require those seeking to inject industrial and hazardous waste to survey existing wells within their injection area. Still, the possibility exists that old oil and gas wells may not be located or were not adequately plugged, or that migration could occur outside of the injection zone.  
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> <I>The Railroad Commission of Texas reported that in 1993, there were 367,188 oil and gas wells registered by the state, about 90,000 of which were inactive. An estimated 1.58 million wells have been drilled in Texas over the past 80 years, less than a quarter of which are estimated to have been properly plugged. Many of these wells are potential vehicles for the migration of saltwater and hazardous waste injected underground. Source: Railroad Commission of Texas, </I>Oil Well Counts by County as of September 1993<I> and </I>Gas Well Counts by County as of September 1993 <I>(Austin: RCT, 1994).</I>
</UL>
<P>
In Texas, the only confirmed case where injected hazardous waste contaminated underground drinking water occurred near Beaumont, Texas in 1975 before more stringent well design standards were enacted.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#106">(106)</A> Soil contamination has also resulted from an industrial injection operation when gas apparently formed within the well, causing the waste to "blow out," spreading waste into the air and over the land.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#107">(107)</A> Spills at the surface during the handling of the waste prior to injection can also contaminate soils and groundwater prior to injection and have occurred in Texas. 
<P>
More likely is contamination resulting from the injection of saltwater and other oil and gas production waste. Injectors of these kinds of waste are regulated by the Railroad Commission of Texas, rather than the TNRCC and EPA (see the Water Quality chapter for a more complete description of oil and gas waste). There have been dozens of recorded cases of contamination from injection of saltwater during oil and gas production in Texas. In 1993, for example, there were two cases of oil and gas saltwater waste from injection wells contaminating groundwater.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#108">(108)</A>
<P>
Acidic chemicals such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid are commonly injected in Texas. Opponents of injection wells have argued that these acidic chemicals have the potential to eat away formations and wells and migrate upward to contaminate groundwater.

MONITORING INJECTION WELLS
</th></tr><tr><td>
The TNRCC emphasizes prevention of leaks rather than after-the-fact groundwater monitoring to assure that no leaks have ocurred in hazardous waste wells. In most cases, no groundwater monitoring is required for hazardous waste injection wells. Instead, operators of industrial hazardous waste injection wells are required to perform an annual mechanical integrity test of the well casing. A space between the tubing in which the waste is injected and a second casing is filled with a pressurized anti-corrosive fluid. Since the pressure of the fluid within the well is known, any drop in pressure would indicate a leak in either the tubing or casing. 
<P>
The usefulness of monitoring wells to detect leakages is hotly debated. There have been cases where groundwater monitoring wells have detected contamination above an injection zone that was not identified by monitoring the pressure within the injection well itself.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#104">(104)</A> In addition, environmental groups are concerned that hazardous waste could migrate beyond the injection zones over the long-term, a problem that could only be detected by groundwater monitoring.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#105">(105)</A>

<B><A NAME="FILLING">Landfilling Hazardous Waste in Texas</A></B>
<P>
At the bottom of the TNRCC's hierarchy of hazardous waste management methods is land disposal, be it landfills, surface impoundment, land treatment units or waste piles. Landfills are controversial for a simple reason: past and present experience has shown that such facilities can eventually leak hazardous materials which can contaminate both the nearby soil and surface and groundwater.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#109">(109)</A> 
<P>
For example, in 1993, the Industrial and Hazardous Waste Division of the TNRCC reported that, between 1989 and 1993, 456 different hazardous waste land disposal sites had contaminated groundwater with either hazardous or other industrial contaminants.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#110">(110)</A> The vast majority of these contamination cases occurred at industrial facilities along the Gulf of Mexico.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#111">(111)</A> 
<P>
Texas does not utilize landfills for its hazardous waste as much as some states. Less than 1 percent of hazardous waste managed on-site, and only 18 percent of Texas-generated hazardous waste disposed of off-site at commercial facilities was managed at landfills or other land disposal facilities.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#112">(112)</A> There is currently only one commercial landfill receiving hazardous waste in Texas, although another has been permitted recently.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#113">(113)</A> About 80 percent of Texas-generated waste which was landfilled went to other states.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#114">(114)</A> In addition, 398,000 tons of Class 1 non-hazardous industrial waste were landfilled in Texas and in other states in 1991.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#115">(115)</A> These non-hazardous waste included asbestos materials, contaminated soils from abandoned waste sites and PCB-contaminated materials. 
<P>
New land-disposal restrictions have prevented some types of waste from being disposed of in landfills, further decreasing the demand for this technology.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#116">(116)</A> In addition, clean-up of abandoned hazardous waste sites under the Superfund program is now emphasizing clean-up of contaminated soils on-site rather than shipping them off-site, which also has reduced the amount of waste landfilled.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#117">(117)</A> Finally, increasing land disposal costs because of RCRA regulations, as well as public opposition and lawsuits over the health impacts of toxic waste dumping, have shifted waste management strategies away from land disposal. 
<P>
Despite more stringent regulations and permitting requirements, not all disposal of industrial waste into landfills or surface impoundments is closely monitored or requires a permit (see box). For example, industrial facilities do not need a permit to dispose of Class I non-hazardous waste at the facility where it is produced. Thus, most on-site facilities that manage non-hazardous industrial waste do not meet the same strict standards as do facilities which manage hazardous waste or even municipal waste landfills.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#118">(118)</A> Yet much Class I waste, including oil and gas waste from exploration and materials containing asbestos and low levels of PCBs, is toxic and potentially dangerous to human health and the environment.
<P>
Commercial waste management facilities are more highly regulated and more of a concern to state officials than on-site landfills. While managers of on-site waste management facilities are extremely familiar with their facility's waste stream, commercial facilities receive waste from tens and sometimes hundreds of industries. Thus, the potential for comingling of different waste streams that react, explode or ignite is much higher. Treatment or disposal of this mixed waste can be much more difficult.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#119">(119)</A>

DUMPING NEAR THE BORDER: MEXICO'S RESPONSE
</th></tr><tr><td>

Controversial plans to locate hazardous and radioactive waste facilities near the border have generated opposition from a new source: Mexico. Mexico is concerned that such facilities could contaminate both the Rio Grande which divides Texas from Mexico, as well as underground aquifers that traverse both sides of the border. 
<P>
For example, a proposal to build a 600-acre hazardous waste and PCB landfill near Dryden, about 15 miles from the border, was opposed by the City of Del Rio, the U.S. National Park Service, the adjacent Mexican state of Coahuila and many others. Chemical Waste Management eventually withdrew its permit application after the executive director of the TNRCC and the Environmental Protection Agency concluded that the company had failed to demonstrate that it could adequately monitor groundwater underneath the proposed site. 
<P>
The Federal Government of Mexico sent several diplomatic notes to the U.S. State Department protesting this landfill and a second for radioactive materials proposed by Texcor near Brackettville. Mexico cited Article 2 of the La Paz Agreement - an environmental agreement signed by the U.S. and Mexico in 1983. Both governments agreed to protect a strip 62 miles wide on each side of the border from environmental degradation. The TNRCC rejected the Texcor landfill application in 1993.

<A NAME="PROPER">ENFORCING</A> PROPER MANAGEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE
</H4>
<P>
About 12,000 facilities are subject to industrial and/or hazardous waste regulations.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#120">(120)</A> In 1993, 480 facilities or industries were cited for being out of compliance with some type of industrial waste regulation. Violations include operating without a permit; not storing waste safely; not monitoring groundwater; not determining if a waste is hazardous; and violating land disposal restrictions.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#121">(121)</A>
<P>
If a company does not take adequate measures to remedy the problem cited in a violation, the TNRCC can seek penalties and an order requiring the company to take specific action. Most of these orders, however, are handled through a negotiation process known as an "Agreed Order." Between 1986 and April of 1994, the TNRCC issued 360 industrial waste agreed orders, requiring companies and facilities to pay nearly $11 million in fines. Because these agreements can sometimes involve a series of remedial actions as well as penalties, it can often take a year or more to fully resolve these situations.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#122">(122)</A>

</th></tr><tr><tD>
Superfund sites are dangerous not just because of what they contain but also because of where they are often located: near population centers. The RSR Lead Smelter in West Dallas operated from at least 1936 to 1984 as a secondary lead smelter operation, turning old lead batteries and other materials into lead. West Dallas residents were possibly exposed to dangerous levels of lead, as well as arsenic and cadmium.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#132">(132)</A> The legacy of hazardous waste from this facility has left irreversible health effects -  mainly due to lead poisoning -  among African Americans and Latinos living in the vicinity of the facility. 
<P>
For example, a 1985 report by the Centers for Disease Control, a federal health agency, found that children living near the RSR smelter had increased blood lead levels. A 1981 EPA study showed that lead levels in soil samples taken from people's backyards and school playgrounds near the smelter averaged nine times higher than those in soil samples taken from another area of West Dallas.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#133">(133)</A> Lead can cause serious and permanent kidney and brain damage at high levels. Even in small amounts, lead can lead to learning disabilities, emotional disturbances and attention disorder among children.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#134">(134)</A> 
<P>
Lawsuits brought by both the residents and the Texas Attorney General's Office resulted in the closing of the plant in 1984 and a $3.8 million clean-up which culminated in 1986. However, following the discovery of high lead blood levels in residents, and "hot spots" that were never properly tested or monitored, a community group called the West Dallas Coalition for Environmental Justice brought a class action suit in 1991 against the EPA in federal court. As a result, the EPA listed part of a 13-square-mile area of West Dallas as a Superfund site in 1993, and a remedial investigation to determine the extent of lead contamination has begun.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#135">(135)</A>
<P>
Residents and community and environmental groups continue to point to other polluting facilities in the area as contributing to the health problems of residents. In fact, right across the street from the old facility, the RSR Corporation continues to operate a battery crushing and lead fabrication plant. Petroleum storage facilities, an asphalt plant, a fertilizer producer, steel mills and asbestos plants are all located in this same area. Although West Dallas comprises about 15 percent of the popula-tion of Dallas County, the area produces more than 40 percent of the county's toxic air pollution.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#136">(136)</A>

<A NAME="KEEP">RESTRICTED</A> AREAS: KEEP OUT
</H4>
<P>
Long before RCRA and the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act were passed to regulate the storage and disposal of hazardous waste, manufacturing industries, the national defense industry and the oil and gas exploration and production industry were producing and disposing of hazardous waste. Many of these waste disposal sites, as well as production facilities, have closed down, been abandoned or changed ownership several times, often without the new owners fully understanding what they have inherited. Not surprisingly, these abandoned and near-abandoned waste sites have contaminated groundwater and surface water and caused adverse human health effects. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) was passed by Congress in 1980 to provide funding to clean up these facilities and waste sites. Since then, Congress has twice reauthorized CERCLA, increasing funding from $1.6 billion to $12.1 billion.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#123">(123)</A> These funds are to be used to help clean up abandoned and closed hazardous waste sites which are placed by the Environmental Protection Agency on a "National Priorities List."<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#124">(124)</A>
<P>
As of May 1993, there were 1331 dump sites on the national Superfund list, as well as many thousands of sites which are of a lesser priority.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#125">(125)</A>  Industrial solvents are present at 87 percent of Superfund sites; inorganic compounds, including lead, at 87 percent; and pesticides at 50 percent of the sites.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#126">(126)</A> All told, 41 million people live within four miles -  and 4.6 million people live within one mile - of one of these top priority dump sites.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#127">(127)</A> Millions more live near other abandoned sites.
<P>
By the end of 1993, there were 30 sites in Texas on the National Priority List. In addition, the Texas Legislature amended the Solid Waste Disposal Act in 1985 to create the State Superfund Program. If a site is not eligible for the national list, it can become part of the State Superfund Program. As of March 1995, there were 42 sites on the State Superfund Registry. Finally, there are another 2,300 closed or abandoned sites which are being screened for Superfund eligibility.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#128">(128)</A> Sixty sites have already been determined as eligible for either the state or federal Superfund list, and that number may increase to 150 over the next 20 years.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#129">(129)</A> Most of the abandoned waste and production facility sites in Texas are related to the production of oil and gas or the chemical industry.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#130">(130)</A>
<P>
Unfortunately, the federal Superfund program has not resulted in the expected rapid restoration of abandoned dump sites. Nationwide, on average it has taken about 2.5 years for the first stages of the clean-up process to begin.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#131">(131)</A> During this phase, the Superfund program attempts to locate responsible parties - those who actually produced, transported or disposed of hazardous waste in an unsafe manner - and make them pay for remediation and restoration. This often results in long legal battles. If the responsible parties are unable or unwilling to fund clean-up, or if they can't be found, the federal government will pay.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#141">(141)</A> As of March 1994, only 224 of the 1331 sites on the National Priorities List had been cleaned up, costing an average of $30 million each, much of the cost in legal fees.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#142">(142)</A> 
<P>
In Texas, the state Superfund program has also had its share of problems. Until 1991, the state did not have a reliable mechanism in place to fund its Superfund efforts. By January 1995, restoration had begun on only two of the 42 sites on the State Superfund Registry.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#143">(143)</A> However, most of these sites are in various stages of investigation, and some have qualified for emergency, short-term removals prior to long-term remediation and closure efforts. The State Superfund program is funded by fees on lead batteries and on tonnage deposited at hazardous and industrial solid waste facilities.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#144">(144)</A> The state spent a total of $22.13 million in FY 1993 and FY 1994 to begin the clean-up process at those sites where a responsible party cannot be held accountable.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#145">(145)</A> 
<P>
An estimated $172 million in federal funds will be spent in Texas at national Superfund sites between 1992 and 1995.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#146">(146)</A> At one site - the Sikes Disposal Pits in Harris County -  nearly $80 million from the federal Superfund will be spent to manage and dispose of soils and sludges contaminated with petrochemical waste from the 1960s.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#147">(147)</A> 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> <I>The State Auditor, in a 1992 review of the state Superfund program, estimated that at current levels of funding it would take more than 25 years to clean up all the sites on the state and national lists and those sites expected to be added in the near future. </I>

<P>
Abandoned hazardous waste sites are an important priority because of their potential to cause serious environmental harm and risks to human health. All of the state and federal sites are subject to groundwater monitoring. The TNRCC has confirmed that 25 of the sites on the federal Superfund list and thirteen of the state-listed sites have already contaminated groundwater with such poisons as arsenic, lead, chromium and PCBs.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#148">(148)</A> Groundwater contamination has also been confirmed at an additional 38 abandoned waste sites that are not on either the state or federal Superfund list.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#149">(149)</A>

TOXICS AND BIRTH DEFECTS
</th></tr><tr><td>
Are hazardous and toxic waste responsible for an unusually high number of birth defects recorded in the late 1980s and early 1990s along the southern Texas-Mexico border? While the answers are far from conclusive, many community and environmental groups, as well as scientists, believe that certain types of birth defects are linked to exposure to pollution from industrial facilities. The controversy along the border dates back to April 1991, when three women at one hospital in Brownsville, Cameron County, Texas, gave birth to infants with anencephaly, a rare birth defect in which babies are born with either incomplete or missing brains and skulls. 
<P>
Following this unexpected event and public outcry it generated, the Texas Department of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control conducted a joint study to identify cases of both anencephaly and other birth defects known collectively as Neural Tube Defects (NTDs) and search for causes. A total of 68 NTDs were discovered among pregnancies conceived in Cameron County from 1986 to 1991, about twice the rate in the United States during the same time period. 
<P>
Moreover, in 1990 and 1991, the rate was nearly 27 per 10,000 births, about six times the national average.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#137">(137)</A> High rates were also found in other counties along the border.
<P>
The CDC/Department of Health report concluded that the causes of these high NTD rates could not be determined.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#138">(138)</A> However, recent evidence has pointed to toxics, notably organic solvents, as possible candidates that could be investigated further. Some studies have pointed to a link between the occurrence of NTDs and certain occupations, such as painters, in which the parents are exposed to solvents.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#139">(139)</A> Moreover, environmentalists point to the rapid industrialization in Matamoros, Mexico as a potential source of high levels of toxic emissions to water and air.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#140">(140)</A>
<P>
Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the amounts and types of waste released by the primarily U.S-owned companies operating on the Mexican border. In the United States companies are required to report this information under Superfund Right-to-Know Legislation; in Mexico, there is no such requirement.

<p>
A one-page manifest must accompany every waste shipment. The resulting paper trail documents the waste's progress through treatment, storage and disposal. A missing form alerts the generator to investigate, which may mean calling in the state agency or EPA.

<A NAME="GETTING">GETTING </A>WASTE FROM POINT A TO POINT B
</H4>
<P>
Millions of tons a year of hazardous waste pass along Texas highways, rivers, coastal waters and railways, potentially exposing Texas residents to accidental spills and releases. Transportation of these hazardous waste is highly regulated. Any transporter shipping hazardous or Class 1 industrial non-hazardous waste must carry what is known as a Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest. This manifest lists both the generator and waste disposal facility, and an EPA identification number.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#150">(150)</A> Only facilities which have a permit from the TNRCC and an EPA identification number are authorized to manage hazardous waste.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#151">(151)</A> 
<P>
In Texas, regulation of oil and hazardous waste spills is divided among a myriad of state and federal agencies. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission is the state's lead agency to respond to inland oil spills, all hazardous substance spills and all other spills under the state's Hazardous Substances Spill Prevention and Control Act.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#152">(152)</A> The Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act, passed by the State Legislature in 1991, designated the Texas General Land Office the state's lead agency for response to oil spills that threaten or enter coastal waters.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#153">(153)</A> Finally, the Railroad Commission of Texas is charged with regulating spills or discharges from exploration, development, or production of oil, gas and geothermal resources.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#154">(154)</A> The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has a role in all three programs in assessing damages to natural resources. 
<P>
By law, transporters and generators must report any spills or accidents in route. In fiscal year 1993, TNRCC received 4,896 reports of spills by transporters and generators of hazardous and oil waste. Of these spills, about 99 percent were cleaned up voluntarily by the responsible parties, and 1 percent (73) required state funds for clean-up.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#155">(155)</A> About $3.4 million were spent to respond to and clean-up these accidents. Most accidents occur on highways.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#156">(156)</A>
<P>
In addition to these transportation-related spills, millions of gallons of oil and gas and other chemical products are spilled from oil and gas production facilities, barges, pipelines and platforms. The Railroad Commission receives reports of more than 5,000 oil spills annually related to oil and gas production, exploration and development.<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#157">(157)</A> The General Land Office responded to 1,304 spills into coastal waters of the state in 1993. Cleaning up 45 of these sites cost $150,000. Funds generated from a fee assessed on all crude oil loaded or unloaded in Texas ports were used for those oil spill clean-ups in which a responsible party cannot be identified (see "Coastal Waters" section, <I>Water Quality </I>chapter).<A HREF="NOTES9.HTML#158">(158)</A>

These extra pounds were not included due to company misunderstanding over whether ammonia sulfate had been delisted in 1993.

Note: El Paso represents a special case. The graphic only shows sources from within the El Paso County area, where an estimated 88 tons of NOx and 90 tons of VOCs are released into the atmosphere -  a relatively low amount compared to Texas' other cities. However, El Paso shares the border with Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, which has a significant influence on air quality in Mexico. A special section later in this chapter - "Sharing Air Along the U.S. -Mexico Border" - will highlight some of these issues.
<P>
Stationary/Area Sources: Major industrial sources (petroleum storage and petrochemical facilities, major manufacturing plants, gasoline pipelines, power plants) and area minor industrial sources (gasoline stations, dry cleaners, oil and gas production, small coating and painting operations, small print shops, landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, consumer commercial solvent use).
<P>
Mobile Sources: Off-road (recreational boats, agricultural, construction, industrial equipment, lawn and garden equipment, airplanes) and on-road (highway vehicles, both gasoline and diesel).

<A NAME="WILD">WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY</A>
</H4>

Judging by the attention that U.S. environmental protection laws are being given today, it would seem that the country's focus on wildlife protection has just begun. In fact, faced with diminished wildlife species due to unregulated hunting and to the "civilizing" of the frontier, the United States began legislatively protecting wildlife and habitats in the 19th century. For example, in 1894, Congress prohibited hunting in Yellowstone National Park. At the same time, the documentation of species loss resulted in the enactment of game laws at both the state and national levels. 
<P>
For the most part, the laws and regulations governing wildlife treat animals, birds and fish as harvestable resources, much like trees: you can only take so much at one time, leaving just enough to continue the reproduction process. 
<P>
The following acts have been significant in federal wildlife legislation:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>In 1900, the Lacy Act authorized activities to protect, preserve, and restore game and other wild birds. 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1903, the Pelican Island National Refuge was established as the first federally protected habitat.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#1">(1)</A>  
	<P>
	<LI>In 1916, the National Park Service Organic Act set up the national park system to provide public recreational areas and to conserve ecologically sensitive acreage.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#2">(2)</A>  
	<P>
	<LI>In 1918, the Migratory Bird Act prohibited the hunting of all migratory and insect-eating birds except as specifically allowed under federal regulations. 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1937, the Pittman-Robertson Act imposed excise taxes on hunting equipment, such as rifles, shotguns and ammunition, to support state wildlife conservation programs. 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1958, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act was established to identify adverse effects on wildlife of water resource development projects while those projects are in their proposal stage. The legislation is incorporated in the 404 section of the Clean Water Act.
	<P>
	<LI>In 1972, the Marine Mammal Protection Act banned the killing and importing of whales and nearly all other marine mammals. 
</UL>
<H4>
<A NAME="ENDANGERED">ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT</A>
</H4>
<P>
Many authorities believe the most far-reaching legislation protecting wildlife and habitat has been the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). Though more than 20 years old, this legislation remains controversial.
<P>
In enacting the Endangered Species Act, Congress addressed the question of why we should spend money to save non-human species. In the preamble to the ESA, Congress stated that "species of fish, wildlife and plants are of aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational and scientific value to the Nation and its people."<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#3">(3)</A> Scientists, conservationists and others concerned with the disappearance of wildlife have argued that all living things are part of a web in which each living creature plays a vital role: the loss of one can be detrimental to the whole. Moreover, conservationists and others agree that the smallest creature - even a slug - could benefit mankind by yielding scientific knowledge, even cures for diseases. They point out that it was a fungus that produced penicillin, the bark of the Yew tree holds a possible cure for some forms of cancer, and an Asian viper might contain a stroke prevention medicine. Plants and small creatures also benefit agriculture: farmers use insects, plants and other animals as alternatives to synthetic chemicals for pest and predator control. Aside from these utilitarian and anthropocentric reasons to preserve earth's species, many believe that every creature has intrinsic value and a right to live no matter what its relationship to humankind or its economic value.

<P>
The key elements of the Endangered Species Act are:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>Congress requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), an agency of the Interior Department, to devise a process for listing species that are endangered or threatened. 
	<P>
	<LI>USWFS must identify critical habitat of the species. Critical habitat is considered to be any ecosystem that, if altered or destroyed, would lead to species extinction or would hinder the recovery of a species. 
	<P>
	<LI>The Act also sets out requirements that prohibit "the taking, possession, transportation or sale of any species designated as threatened or endangered without a permit." "Take" under the Endangered Species Act includes killing, capturing, harming, and harassing. Harm includes modifying habitat to the point that the species' breeding, feeding, or sheltering is impaired.
	<P>
	<LI>Under the Endangered Species Act, any federal agency whose actions might affect an endangered species or its habitat must consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The federal agency must review its own actions to see if those actions might affect endangered species or its habitat. In the review process, the acting federal agency may ask for comments from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. For projects occurring in Texas, the acting federal agency can ask the Fish and Wildlife Service to review its proposed actions to see if those actions might affect endangered species or its habitat. 
	<P>
	<LI>Non-federal actions require approval of the Fish and Wildlife Service where there is a "take" of endangered species, provided such "taking" is incidental to and not the purpose of the activity. For example, if a private landowner wants to build a shopping center on land that has been determined to have an endangered species or its habitat, the landowner must get a permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#4">(4)</A> 
</UL>
<H4>
<A NAME="CRITICAL">CRITICAL HABITAT DESIGNATION</A>
</H4>
<P>
In addition to listing species as "endangered" or "threatened," the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can also designate critical habitats, that is, habitat necessary to recover the endangered species. "Critical habitat consists of those areas of land, water, and air space that an endangered or threatened species needs to survive and recover. Critical habitat may be one or more large geographic areas, or just a small area depending on the needs and distribution of the species."<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#5">(5)</A> There are a number of steps the Service must take before a critical habitat designation is made: 1) wildlife biologists identify the areas of importance to the species; 2) the Service analyzes the economic and other impacts of designating the area as a critical habitat; 3) the Service prepares a list of proposed areas and publishes it in the Federal Register and formally notifies federal, state and county governments and citizens seeking their comments; 4) after the public review period, the Service makes necessary changes; and, finally, 5) the Service officially designates the critical habitat.
<P>
Designating a critical habitat has two dominant impacts. Federal agencies must consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service if any of their activities affect the critical habitat, such as building a highway or reservoir. Because the Endangered Species Act prevents any federal action that adversely affects critical habitat, the activity contemplated might have to be altered. The same holds true for any activity or project that requires a federal permit or involves federal funding. The second impact is to make people aware that the area is important to the survival of an endangered species.
<P>
"Designation of critical habitat does not provide for federal government review of private land use, unless the landowner is planning a project that requires a federal permit or uses federal funds." <A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#6">(6)</A> However, the protection afforded the "taking" of an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act are not changed by the designation of critical habitat.
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> Though the permitting process has been available since 1982, the first permit was not issued in Texas until 1992. Because of population growth patterns and the location of endangered species and critical habitats in Central Texas, the USFWS located in Austin is the only Texas office that has furnished incidental-taking permits. It has not denied any request for incidental-taking permits, though all the permits require some form of mitigation activities. 
<P>

</UL>
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> Relying on English common law, the federal Endangered Species Act has treated plant species as different from wildlife. Plants are considered to be a part of the real estate on which they grow, and thus they are legally treated as a part of private property. Animals, however, are part of the public trust and not owned by the property owner. 
</UL>
<P>
The Endangered Species Act has received its share of criticism from both environmentalists and landowners. Environmentalists claim that high profile species (what some call the "charismatic megafauna" or the "cuddly factor"), such as the bald eagle and grizzly bear, receive disproportionate funding for recovery while plants and invertebrates disappear. Some ESA detractors also suggest the Act is a crisis-based approach to species protection because it was designed to save species already on the verge of extinction, rather than foster a strategy that protects habitat. According to these critics, habitat or ecosystem management would provide a preventive approach to species protection. Meanwhile, others worry that the population of a species gets fundamentally reduced while the species waits to be listed as endangered. For example, the golden-cheeked warbler was identified as endangered in 1976 but was not listed by the Service until 1990. Others note that the Endangered Species Act has been more successful in recovery of species on public lands than on private lands. In the United States, 51 percent of endangered and threatened species are found on private lands. 
<P>
Some private landowners, who in Texas own approximately 97 percent of the land, argue that the Endangered Species Act has burdened them with the major responsibility of protecting endangered species without any compensation. These landowners claim that the Endangered Species Act lowers property values, and because of a cumbersome permit process, their ability to sell their property is hindered. Some private landowners further assert that the ESA is an assault on the Fifth Amendment private property right.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#7">(7)</A> Farmers and ranchers who oppose the ESA claim they have been the best stewards of the land and can manage it in an ecologically sound manner without federal guidance.
<P>
Regrettably, in Texas and elsewhere, the Endangered Species Act has become the target for special interest debate when in fact, it should be, as one adherent stated, "a common interest debate."<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#8">(8)</A> Both landowners and conservationists do seem to agree that species - not just endangered species - and habitat protection is important and cannot be achieved solely through government regulations. In Texas and across the country, states, municipalities, conservation groups, and landowners are proceeding to fashion new cooperative approaches and economic incentives for wildlife and habitat protection that address the concerns of both conservationists and landowners. Because 95 percent of the land in the United States (97 percent in Texas) is privately held, most approaches consider the interests of private landowners in preserving wildlife habitat. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department have programs that provide rural landowners with technical assistance on how to preserve wetlands and enhance other types of wildlife habitats. These ideas will be discussed later in this section.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#9">(9)</A>

<A NAME="CONSERVATION">WILDLIFE HABITAT CONSERVATION ACTIVITIES AND ACQUISITIONS
</A></H4>
<P>
There are a number of on-going public-private partnerships and country-to-country cooperative arrangements aimed at preserving the rich wetlands found in Texas. Landowner participation in these efforts is voluntary, however, and their success will depend on this participation increasing. 
<P>
The North American Waterfowl Management Plan was signed in 1986 by the Canadian and United States governments. Mexico has also signed an agreement to assist in this effort. The plan's goal is to preserve 6 million acres of wetlands and to increase North America's waterfowl population to more than 100 million birds by the year 2000. Partnerships of public and private organizations work toward the goal of wetland preservation by purchasing or leasing wetlands or using conservation easements. Farm owners are provided economic incentives to strengthen wildlife habitats. Two of the nine joint ventures currently underway are targeting the playa lakes of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Colorado and the Gulf of Mexico coast stretching from Texas to Alabama. 
<P>
Other public and private initiatives being carried out to protect, maintain, manage and restore wildlife habitat in Texas include the following:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>Texas Parks and Wildlife and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation are assisting eight landowners in the Texas Panhandle and South Plains to enhance wildlife habitat. The projects are cost-shared, 50-50, by the landowner and the foundation.
	<P>
	<LI>The Texas Department of Transportation is purchasing bottomland hardwood acreage as potential mitigation banking credits. In other words, foreseeing that it might in the future destroy wetlands during highway construction, the Department of Transportation is purchasing bottomland hardwoods to compensate and substitute for any acreage it might destroy. (See focus piece on Mitigation for further discussion.) 
	<P>
	<LI>The Wetlands Reserve Program of the 1990 Farm Bill offers landowners payments for restoring and protecting wetlands on their property. In 1994, $66.75 million was allocated to 20 states, including Texas, to enroll 75,000 acres. Under the program, owners of farm wetlands voluntarily sell permanent easements of farmed wetlands that were converted to farmland prior to December 23, 1985 (prior to the enactment of the 1985 Farm Bill). Farmers get a lump sum equaling no more than the fair market price of the farmland and a cost share payment to assist them in implementing a wetland restoration plan. As of July 1994, Texas had no Wetland Reserve participants; however, approximately 20 Texas farmers have submitted offers to the national Agriculture Stabilization Conservation Service office and are awaiting determination.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#41">(41)</A>
	<P>
	<LI>U.S. Fish and Wildlife, Texas Parks and Wildlife, Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service and Ducks Unlimited created the Texas Prairie Wetlands Project to provide technical assistance and financial incentives to farmers and ranchers interested in improving or restoring wetland habitats along the Gulf Coast. Through January 1994, 4,901 acres of wetland projects had been completed or were under construction for 30 landowners. Another 132 landowners controlling 1,231,023 acres had received on-site technical assistance.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#42">(42)</A>
	<P>
	<LI>Since 1976, Texas Parks and Wildlife biologists have provided technical assistance on ecosystem management to private landowners with 100 acres or more. During fiscal year 1993, 625 technical assistance agreements, representing 6.2 million acres, had been signed between landowners and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
	<P>
	<LI>* Mitigation efforts are also helping to offset the destruction of valuable wildlife habitat. The exact acreage of wildlife habitat that has been preserved through mitigation is difficult to determine because there is no monitoring of the process. (See focus segment on <I>Mitigation</I> for further explanation of this process.) 
</UL>
<P>
The table on page 130 shows wildlife acreage in Texas that the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) plans to acquire in the near future.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#43">(43)</A> The majority of planned acquisitions are additions to existing wildlife sanctuaries. They do not represent new refuges. The term "remaining" refers to those acres that USFWS plans to acquire if granted Congressional appropriations to do so.
<H4>
<A NAME="INFORMATION">INFORMATION AND INCENTIVES FOR WILDLIFE HABITAT PROTECTION
</A></H4>
<P>
Many resource planners, environmentalists and landowners are looking toward a community planning process and various financial and tax incentives for private landowners as the means of habitat preservation. With 97 percent of all land held privately, an incentives approach seems reasonable. The following are some ideas that have been compiled by the Defenders of Wildlife, a national environmental organization: <A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#44">(44)</A> 
<P>
<UL>
	
	<LI>Tax Incentives and Disincentives - 
	<P>
<OL>
		<LI>Local and state property taxes paid on lands providing habitat for endangered, threatened and candidate species and for significant biodiversity would be offset by an annual federal tax credit. Landowners would develop a Habitat Management Plan in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
		<P>
		<LI>Federal tax credits for expenses assumed for improving or creating new habitat for endangered, threatened and candidate species.
		<P>
		<LI>Income tax deductions for revenue from lands managed to support endangered species.
		<P>
		<LI>Tax penalties for converting wildlife habitat to some other use.
		<P>
		<LI>Prohibition on the use of federal subsidies and tax benefits for activities causing the loss or degradation of endangered species habitat.
</OL>
<P>
	<LI>Endangered Species Act's Habitat Conservation Plan - Section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act provides for residential and commercial development within an area that has endangered or threatened species habitat whenever a habitat conservation plan is submitted and accepted by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. As of 1994, eight habitat conservation plans - the majority in California - have been accepted by the Service. The Balcones Canyonlands Habitat Conservation Plan is in the process for the Austin area. 
	<P>
	<LI>Cooperative Conservation Plan - rural agricultural landowners, who are not interested in developing their land, with contiguous or nearly contiguous property would be able to form cooperatives to accomplish the same goals as the ESA Habitat Conservation Plan without having to participate in an ESA Habitat Conservation Plan. The cooperative would operate as a wildlife management cooperative.
	<P>
	<LI>Habitat Transaction Method - The objective is to preserve habitats sufficient to sustain species and/or populations addressed by a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP). A process is established for measuring the conservation value of all the land in the planning area covered by the HCP. Any landowner who agrees to conserve or restore habitat within the planning area receives credits based on the conservation value that the landowner adds to the reserve system. Landowners who receive credits for conservation actions may either use the credits to develop elsewhere within the planning area or sell the credits to any other landowner who needs credits to compensate for project impacts.
	<P>
	<LI>Biodiversity Trust Fund - This proposal suggests that the "takings" provision of the Endangered Species Act be complemented and eventually replaced by a biodiversity trust fund. The trust fund would provide landowners with incentives to protect endangered and threatened species and ecosystems. As author Randall O'Toole envisions it, 10 percent of all public land user fees would be dedicated to the fund each year. A board of trustees nominated by the President and other Cabinet officials would administer the fund. The fund must improve biodiversity or protect endangered or threatened species. Eligible activities for funding include purchase of land, purchases of conservation easements, paying landowners to use certain habitat preservation practices and paying "bounties" to landowners whose land provides breeding habitat for threatened or endangered species.

</H4>
<P>
In 1993, Governor Ann Richards formed the Governor's Task Force on Nature Tourism in Texas. The Task Force is charged with helping local communities and private landowners develop passive wildlife programs to conserve both wildlife habitat and to stimulate economic growth through environmentally based tourism. The Executive Director of Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Executive Director of the Texas Department of Commerce co-chair the task force. 
<P>
The U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service reports that Americans spent $18 billion in 1991 on wildlife-related travel items. During that same year, Texans spent nearly $1 billion dollars on food, lodging and expenses for various wildlife-viewing activities. In Southeast Texas near Houston, a study conducted in 1992 at High Island bird sanctuary concluded that 6,000 bird watchers spent about $1.2 million to see songbirds.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#45">(45)</A> 
<P>
Though nature tourism holds the promise for economic development for local communities, it also has the potential to damage the very environments and the local communities meant to benefit. Several books have been written on how to minimize the threats that nature tourists have on natural areas and habitats. Two are: Policies for Maximizing Nature Tourism's Ecological and Economic Benefits, written by Kreg Lindberg and published by the World Resources Institute and Nature Tourism: Managing for the Environment, edited by Tensie Whelan and published by Island Press.

<A NAME="HABITAT">WILDLIFE AND HABITAT PROTECTION LEGISLATION IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas has a legislative history of species and habitat protection. According to author Robin Doughty, due to over-hunting, the decline of deer, turkey and fur-bearing animals in Texas was noticeable by the 1830s and 40s.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#10">(10)</A> A decline in certain bird species was also documented at this time. In response, the Texas Legislature enacted game laws. Game laws are still prevalent today and are used to prevent the demise, or in some cases, to control the proliferation of specific species.
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>In 1860, the first game law in Texas provided closed season for the hunting of quail on Galveston Island; this act did not attempt to provide for wildlife protection statewide but was aimed at protecting the quail of Galveston Island, which were being over-hunted.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#11">(11)</A>
	<P>
	<LI>In 1879, Governor Oran M. Roberts created the first state institution for the conservation of animals. The State Fish Commissioner was appointed to improve the conditions of freshwater fish species and marine organisms that were being heavily exploited as a food resource and also were being affected by water pollution.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#12">(12)</A> 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1903, under the Act to Preserve and Protect the Wild Game, Wild Birds and Wild Fowl, the state established a five-year closed season for the hunting of antelope, mountain sheep, and pheasants and ended commerce in wild animal meat, skins and plumage. 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1907, a law authorized the new Game, Fish and Oyster Commissioner to sell hunting licenses to finance enforcement of game laws. (In 1910, however, the Texas Legislature appropriated the fund for other purposes and little enforcement took place.)
	<P>
	<LI>In 1925, a state law was passed to establish game preserves on privately held land.
	<P>
	<LI>In l973, The Texas Legislature enacted a state Endangered Species Act, which was amended in l981, 1985 and l987. The Act gave the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) the authority to establish a list of fish, wildlife and plants endangered or threatened with statewide extinction. Once listed, these species are afforded protection and are eligible for restoration efforts. 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1983, The Texas Legislature established a Special Non-game and Endangered Species Fund to support non-game and endangered species research and management. The Fund receives money from fines, the sale of posters, stamps, and decals and from private donations. Also, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shares a portion of the money it receives from the federal excise tax on hunting equipment with the states to support non-game and endangered species research and management.
	<P>
	<LI>In 1991, the 72nd Legislature adopted a bill adding wildlife management to the list of "agricultural uses" which qualified otherwise taxable open land for special appraisal valuation for property tax purposes. Though the Attorney General must still address some unanswered questions regarding the interpretation of this bill, essentially farmers who take land out of production and return it to a natural state for the purpose of wildlife management may be taxed according to the land's productivity value rather than its market value. In other words, the land retains its "agricultural use" property-tax status. 
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> In the state Endangered Species Act, there is no state criterion for protecting wildlife species from indirect take (e.g., destruction of habitat or unfavorable management practices). The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department does have a Memorandum of Understanding with every state agency to conduct a thorough environmental review of state initiated and funded projects, such as highways, reservoirs, land acquisition and building construction, to determine the potential impact on state endangered or threatened species.

Surveys conducted separately by Texas A&amp;M University and Rice University reflect Texans' strong concern for wildlife. A 1989 Texas A&amp;M survey revealed that 93 percent of Texans believe that endangered species should be protected.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#13">(13)</A> A Rice University poll conducted in December 1994 showed that 56 percent of those surveyed were willing to spend more tax monies to set aside and protect wilderness areas for endangered species in Texas; 37 percent were against spending more tax monies. Sixty-one percent of those surveyed agreed that "when humans change the natural environment, by building dams or clearing forests, it often can have disasterous results." Moreover, 64 percent of those interviewed agreed with the following view: "Some restrictions on property rights are justified to protect important aspects of the environment, such as wetlands or endangered species."<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#14">(14)</A>
<P>
A nationwide poll conducted in May 1994 found Americans surveyed supported setting aside more land for conservation and making landowners abide by rules to protect plants and animals. The poll indicated that 66 percent of those interviewed stated that they were more concerned with the environment than they had been a few years ago. Some 65 percent of those interviewed said more land should be set aside for conservation purposes.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#15">(15)</A>

<A NAME="FISH">FISH AND WILDLIFE CONDITIONS IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Known for its ecological diversity, Texas is the home of 5,500 plant species, 425 of which only occur in Texas. Of 1,100 vertebrate species in Texas, 60 are found nowhere else in the world. With 540 bird species, Texas has more than any other state in the U.S.
<P>
As of December 1, 1993, the federal government listed 629 U.S. plant and animal species as endangered and 189 as threatened. Four hundred and ninety-five foreign only (not found in the United States) plant and animals species are endangered and 38 foreign only plant and animal species are threatened. In the future, it is expected that 3,000 species may need to be listed as endangered and threatened.
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> There are 75 federally listed and proposed species in Texas: 27 plants; 48 birds, mammals, reptiles, fish, amphibians, arachnids and insects. There are 151 state listed species in Texas: 25 plants, 126 animals. 
	<p><I>Source: Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. </I>
	<I>Information furnished by the Resource Protection Division. Austin, Texas. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Texas State Office, 1995 listing.</I>
</UL>
<P>
Extinction of animal species in Texas has increased dramatically since the turn of the century. Prior to 1900, three species were known to have disappeared. Between 1901-1958 four species are known to have disappeared. From 1959 to the present, ten species have disappeared. Of these 17 species, six are globally extinct. 
<P>
The extinction rate in Texas of plant species is difficult to ascertain. The survival of plant species has become a public concern only recently, and inventories are limited.
<P>
Texas has the third highest number of listed endangered and threatened species of any state. Florida and Hawaii are number one and number two. Besides those species currently listed as endangered and threatened, there is evidence to indicate that another 305 species in Texas are candidates for the endangered and threatened lists.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#18">(18)</A> 
<P>
According to the American Fisheries Society's endangered species committee, Texas is one of the most hazardous places in the United States for a fish species. The state has lost six species of fish - four since 1980.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#19">(19)</A>  In 1994, 29 fish species are listed as endangered or threatened. 
<P>
Interestingly, concern for the decline in freshwater fish species in the mid 1800s in Texas spurred the state's first conservation institution - the Fish Commissioner. Because the Fish Commissioner had limited resources and authority, however, the office did little to improve conditions for fish species. Instead, the Fish Commissioner attempted to compensate for the decline in native species by introducing European carp to Texas.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#20">(20)</A>

<P>
The Federal Endangered Species Act requires states to design a recovery program for each listed species. In Texas, the legislature delegated this responsibility to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The American alligator is the only endangered species on the Texas list that has ever been removed from the endangered list because of successful recovery activities.
<P>
Some of the methods used in recovery programs include research on the reproductive habits and ecology of rare species, examination of the taxonomic relationship of rare species to their environment and each other to determine appropriate survival and management strategies, assistance to landowners to improve wildlife habitat, and the purchase, where funds are available, of wildlife habitats. Texas Parks and Wildlife receives enough money to study only one in 10 endangered species.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#22">(22)</A> 
<P>
Though scientists understand the importance of habitat to the life of a species, they are just beginning to determine what constitutes livable space for a species. Biologists do know, however, that the loss of one species in an ecosystem can sometimes threaten the balance of the entire ecosystem and may cause its demise. For instance, Texas Parks and Wildlife speculates that the extirpation of the Black-footed Ferret may have contributed to problems managing prairie dog populations.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#23">(23)</A>

<P>
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department is responsible for investigating any pollution that may affect fish and wildlife in Texas.
<P>
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's regional offices for pollution response received a total of 402 fish kill and pollution complaint calls in 1992.

According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the majority of calls reporting pollution and fish kills originate in areas of high urban and industrial development. This is due both to the increased pressure on the environment in these areas as well as the larger number of people who observe and report problems. The upper Texas coastal area (Houston-Port Arthur/Beaumont) normally has the highest number of incidents for each year. Other regions that have a significant number of reports are the regions that include Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, the Corpus Christi area and the Lower Rio Grande Valley.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#24">(24)</A>

LOSS OF FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT
</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>
<B>Springs and Spring Runs
</B></TD></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: Due to their unique characteristics (constant temperature, clear water and in some cases isolation from connecting watercourses), these habitats are natural settings for many rare and unusual species. Status: A significant number of Texas springs have gone dry from man's activities. Over pumping of groundwater for irrigation and human use has led to lowering of groundwater tables and decreased or ceased spring discharge (the Edward's Aquifer is one example). Texas historically had 281 major springs. By 1973 only 2 of 4 very large and 17 
of 31 large springs were still flowing. Future: Increasing pressures on groundwater and aquifers will continue to impact existing springs, affecting associated flora and fauna.
</TD></TR><TR><Td>
<B>Bottomland Hardwoods
</B></Td></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: Texas' most diverse terrestrial habitat. An estimated 16 million acres of riparian (river/stream associated) habitat existed in early Texas. Status: More than 60 percent has been lost to agricultural conversion, timber production, urban/industrial development and reservoir construction. Future: Additional water development, new technologies in the use of hardwood pulp, and forestry practices threaten this habitat, especially in East Texas.
</TD></TR><TR><Td>
<B>Coastal Wetlands</B>
</Td></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: The most important estuarine habitat since 90 percent of commercially and recreationally important species depend on these wetlands. One-third of all endangered species occur here and millions of waterfowl overwinter in this habitat. Status: Some 53 percent of all USA wetlands have been lost to dredge and fill for development, subsidence and agricultural conversion. Texas has lost more than 50 percent of its original 1.2 million acres. Thirty-five percent of losses have occurred since 1950. Almost half of Texas estuarine areas are closed, or conditionally closed, to shellfish harvest because of pollution. Future: Coastal development, loss of freshwater inflows and sea level rise threaten remaining wetlands.
</TD></TR><TR><Td>
<B>South Texas Brushlands
</B></Td></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: A unique habitat where more than 500 vertebrate species and more than 260 species of woody plants occur. Numerous endangered species including the ocelot and jaguarundi are found here. Status: Since the 1920s, more than 95 percent of the original brushlands have been converted to agricultural and urban use. Future: Restoration of brush and acquisition of remaining habitat is key to maintaining this unique ecosystem.
</TD></TR><TR><Td>
<B>Texas Prairie
</B></Td></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: More than 20 million acres of tallgrass communities once covered the Texas Blacklands Prairie, the Fort Worth Prairie, the Feyette Prairie and the Coastal Prairie. Status: Of the 12.6 million acres of the Blacklands Prairie, fewer than 100,000 acres (less than 10 percent) of native sod exist today. A million acres of Coastal Prairie have been urbanized by Houston. Endangered species such as the Attwater's prairie chicken are on the edge of extinction because of such losses. Future: Continued losses to this habitat is expected. Restoration, cooperative actions and private landowners will be key to saving these prairie habitats.

<H4>
<A NAME="LOSS">THE LOSS OF WILDLIFE HABITAT 
</A></H4>
<P>
Today the overwhelming majority of losses of and threats to wildlife, plants and natural communities are a direct result of habitat alteration or destruction, caused by urbanization, timber production, reservoirs and agriculture.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#25">(25)</A> According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the following are examples of habitat loss in Texas: 
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>All but a fraction of the prairies of central and coastal Texas have been converted to farmland, and as a result the Attwater's Prairie Chicken is on the brink of extinction and Texas Prairie Dawn, a plant of the coastal prairies, is now rare.
	<P>
	<LI>River bottom hardwood forests in Texas have been reduced from 16 to six million acres and longleaf pine forests have nearly all been cut-over. As a result of these changes, Texas Trailing Phlox and many other plants are rare, the Ivory-billed Woodpecker is gone from Texas, and the Red-cockaded Woodpecker is threatened with the same fate.
	<P>
	<LI>The original grasslands of South Texas have been lost to brush invasion, the grassland-dependent Aplomado Falcon disappeared from Texas, the Slender Rush-Pea is endangered, and the South Texas Ambrosia has become rare.
	<P>
	<LI>Sub-tropical woodlands of the Rio Grande Valley have been converted to farmlands and citrus plantations, resulting in near-extinction of the Ocelot in Texas and increasing rarity for many plants, such as the Texas Ayenia.
	<P>
	<LI>Ground water pumping in West Texas and dam construction throughout the state have modified springs and rivers so that species such as the Amistad Gambusia and Phantom Shiner are extinct, and many other species, such as the Puzzle Sunflower, are rare.
	<P>
	<LI>* Urbanization and land clearing in the Texas hill country have destroyed and fragmented woodland habitat of the endangered Golden-cheeked Warbler, along with several rare plants.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#26">(26)</A> 
</UL>
<P>
Another indication of ecological change is the documentation that marine and brackish fishes have invaded the lower Rio Grande basin as a result of high salinity, which in turn is forcing out freshwater fish.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#27">(27)</A> 
<P>
Texas has 133 million acres of wildlife habitat remaining. This includes springs, bottomland hardwoods, coastal wetlands, south Texas brush lands, and Texas prairies. Ninety-seven percent of the land in Texas is privately held. Therefore, the continued existence of wildlife habitat is very much in the hands of the private sector. 
<P>
Wildlife habitat in Texas is broken into eight categories:<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#28">(28)</A> 
<P>
<OL>
	<LI><B>Grasses</B>, 32 percent - herbs, grasses, forbs and grasslike plants are dominant
	<P>
	<LI><B>Brush</B>, 20 percent - woody plants, most less than nine feet tall, are dominant
	<P>
	<LI><B>Shrub</B>, 15 percent - individual wood plants generally less than nine feet tall and widely scattered throughout arid region
	<P>
	<LI><B>Parks</B>, 13 percent - home to woody plants mostly equal to or greater than nine feet tall, dominant and growing as clusters 
	<P>
	<LI><B>Forest</B>, 13 percent - deciduous or evergreen trees dominant; most taller than 30 feet with closed crowns
	<P>
	<LI><B>Woods</B>, 6 percent - woody plants mostly nine to 30 feet tall with closed crowns; midstory usually lacking
	<P>
	<LI><B>Swamps</B>, less than 1 percent - deciduous or evergreen trees with varying heights within inundated or almost inundated sites
	<P>
	<LI><B>Marsh</B>, less than 1 percent - emergent herbaceous plants dominant in inundated areas, woody vegetation lacking or nearly so.

To encourage people to make environmentally-sound choices about where to live and do business in the Austin area, the Hill Country Foundation has developed a color map which includes text and graphics illustrating geologic and natural history of Travis County and parts of Williamson and Hays Counties. The map includes information on endangered species habitat areas, watersheds, aquifer recharge zones, 100-year flood plains, school district boundaries and location of major employers. The Hill Country Foundation has produced a creative tool to help citizens and businesses manage urban growth in environmentally sensitive areas. The map is being made available to the real estate and business communities to be used as a corporate relocation tool. Maybe other communities will join in this approach. <P>Contact: Hill Country Foundation, 1800 Guadalupe, Austin, Texas 78701.

<A NAME="MANAGE">WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREAS IN TEXAS
</A></H4>
<P>
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department owns and/or leases approximately 700,000 acres for wildlife management areas. 
<P>
The funds used for acquisition and operation of state wildlife management areas is derived from an excise tax on hunting equipment and from hunting stamps. No general revenue is used.
<P>
In Texas, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages 18 national wildlife refuges, totaling 417,000 acres. 
<H4>

<A NAME="WETLANDS">WETLANDS: CRITICAL HABITATS
</A></H4>
<P>
Wetlands ecosystems are second only to the rain forests in the number of wildlife and plant species that depend on them for feeding and habitat. 
<P>
Wetlands are defined "as areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions."<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#29">(29)</A> Wetlands include marshes, swamps, bogs, and shallow lakes and can include floodplains and mudflats.
<P>
Among their many valuable functions, which include filtering pollutants and preventing erosion and flooding, wetlands are the breeding, feeding and nesting grounds for many endangered species and plants and for non-endangered wildlife and natural communities. 
<P>
In recognizing the tremendous importance of wetlands, the federal government established a national goal of "no overall net loss of wetlands." The Clean Water Act of 1972 is the law that has had the greatest impact upon wetlands. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers for any dredging or filling into waters of the United States. This includes both terrestrial and coastal wetlands. 
<P>
In Texas in 1993, of the 1,510 Section 404 permits issued for dredging and filling wetlands, 733 were found in coastal areas. Only 20 to 30 inland permits are issued a year and those are usually for reservoirs that significantly affect wetlands.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#30">(30)</A> This does not indicate that inland wetlands are less threatened by human activities, however. The 404 permit process is discussed in the <I><A HREF="../QualityCh2p1.html">Water Quality</A></I> chapter.

<A NAME="PROTECT">PROTECTING WETLANDS IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Though Texas has lost one-half of its coastal wetlands and 60 percent of its terrestrial wetlands in the last 200 years, there is no state law to protect wetlands. In the coastal management legislation of 1991, Texas legislators did incorporate a no-net-loss of wetlands <I>policy </I>for <I>state-owned </I>land. Though this is a positive step, the majority of wetlands are on private lands. 
<P>
Three state agencies have significant roles in wetland protection: the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and the Texas General Land Office. Among federal agencies, the Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have significant responsibility for wetland protection. 
<P>
There are two major types of wetlands in Texas: inland/terrestrial wetlands and Coastal wetlands. Inland wetlands include bottomland hardwood forests in East Texas and riparian vegetation and playa lakes (shallow lakes) in West Texas. A discussion of coastal wetlands, including salt and freshwater marshes, is found in the section on water resources. 
<P>
Interior wetlands account for 80 percent of the total wetland acreage in Texas. Texas has lost 60 percent of its most valuable inland wetlands: the riparian communities.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#31">(31)</A> Most of the inland wetlands are on privately held properties. 
<P>
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has been assigned as the lead agency to develop a state wetlands conservation plan. Though the plan will be statewide in scope, it will focus on inland wetlands, since the Texas General Land Office is developing a coastal wetlands plan. According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, conserving wetlands will depend on acquisition, cooperative agreements, education and technical assistance.

<A NAME="BOTTOM">BOTTOMLAND FORESTED WETLANDS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Bottomland hardwood systems are the most diverse Texas ecosystems. Bottomland wetlands are plant communities that have been created as a result of the actions of creeks, rivers and flood plains. The bottomland hardwood forest is a part of a system that starts at a river's headwaters and ends in an estuary at the ocean. Trees found in the bottom-land hardwood forests include bald cypress, pecan, oaks, elm, cottonwood and hackberry. These hardwoods, particularly old-growth hardwoods (50 to 100 years old), contribute to the biodiversity of the wetland system. They also provide food and shelter for wildlife.
<P>
At least 189 species of trees and shrubs, 42 woody vines, 75 grasses and 802 herbaceous plants occur in Texas bottomlands. Bottomland systems also support 116 species of fish, 31 species of amphibians, 54 species of reptiles, 273 species of birds and 45 species of mammals.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#32">(32)</A> Seventy-four species of threatened and endangered animals depend directly on bottomland hardwood systems. Over 50 percent of all the neotropical songbirds that are not listed as endangered or threatened are associated with bottomland hardwood forests. Thirty-one water species (mallards and wood ducks), eastern wild turkey, swamp rabbit, gray squirrel and 11 species of furbearers depend on bottomland hardwoods.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#33">(33)</A> 
<P>
These bottomland systems also play a vital role in maintaining water quality. By serving as a depository for sediments, wastes and pollutants from runoff, these bottomland forests enhance the water quality of bays and estuaries which lie at the lower end of these riparian corridors. Some pollutants are transformed into less harmful substances by microbiological agents in the floodplain.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#34">(34)</A> Bottomlands also play a critical role in containing floodwaters when rivers overflow. 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> Forested wetland systems support fish and wildlife populations that are an integral part of the state's $4.2 billion hunting and fishing industry.
</UL>
<P>
In the 18th century, Texas had approximately 16 million acres of hardwood bottomland riparian corridors. Today, the state has 5.9 million acres of bottomland hardwoods -  a 63 percent loss of bottomland hardwood. This acreage currently comprises 3 percent of the total land area of the state.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#35">(35)</A> The majority of bottomland hardwood acres are found in East Texas; only about one million acres are scattered through the western portion of the state.
<P>
Both the Texas Forest Service and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department recognize that there has been a steady decline in bottomland hardwood forests since the early 19th century.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#36">(36)</A> Texas Parks and Wildlife shows that losses of bottomland hardwoods are continuing in Texas at the rate of about 12 percent per decade.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#37">(37)</A> Reservoirs, development and agriculture threaten bottomland hardwood. But hardwood pulp (ground-up wood fiber) consumption is responsible for the recent upward trend in exploitation of bottomland ecosystems in Texas. Pulpwood consumption in the U.S. is expected to more than double from 82 million tons in l986 to 173 million tons by 2040, and pulpwood demand worldwide has further stimulated increased consumption of hardwoods. This demand is fueled by the demand for high quality computer paper, white cardboard shipping cartons and other paper products, such as six-pack soda carriers, which require a higher hardwood fiber component.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#38">(38)</A> In the U.S., Texas ranks seventh in pulpwood consumption by manufacturing industries.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#39">(39)</A>

<H4><A NAME="PLAYA">PLAYA LAKES</A></H4>
<P>
Texas playa lakes - shallow, circular basins - are the wintering wetland habitat for millions of waterfowl that migrate from as far north as Canada. There are 20,000 playa lakes located in 37 counties of the Texas Panhandle and South Plains. The total area of playa basins has been estimated at 296,000 acres. Fifteen million birds annually migrate through these playas in the fall and spring on their way to and from wintering habitat on the Gulf Coast and farther south.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#40">(40)</A> Ducks, geese and sandhill cranes also use these playas as winter havens. The majority of these oases of wildlife habitat are located within intensively cultivated, privately held farmland. Precipitation and irrigation runoff contribute to the development of these wetlands. Land use practices and changes in irrigation methods intended to limit runoff are reducing the capacity of playas to provide food and water for waterfowl.

<TR><TH> SEDIMENTATION
</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>
Sedimentation is usually the end result of the erosion process. When a soil particle is detached and transported by water to a new site of deposit, it is referred to as sediment. The soil particle might be temporarily deposited several times before it reaches its end destination.

<A NAME="EROSION">CROPLAND EROSION AND SURFACE WATER</A>
</H4>
<p>
Cropland erosion has impacts on more than agricultural production. According to studies conducted by the USDA in 1987, agriculture accounts for more than "50 percent of suspended sediments from all sources discharged in surface waters" and greater proportions in predominantly agricultural regions.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#13">(13)</A> Findings of a nationwide study conducted from 1974 to 1981 concluded that surface water sediment deposition was "significantly related to cropland erosion within basins. It was not closely related to estimates of total basin erosion from forest land, pasture land or range land."<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#14">(14) </A> 
<p>
The increased murkiness in the water caused by sediment loading decreases light for submerged aquatic vegetation. As a result, both aquatic vegetation and species that depend on aquatic vegetation for breeding and food can decline.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#15">(15)</A> The relationship between sediment and nutrient runoff from agricultural lands and their effects on estuaries is discussed in the water chapter. Sediment loading can also fill reservoirs, clog navigable waterways, reduce recreational use of waters and increase operating costs of water-treatment facilities.  
<p>
Some sediment deposits can be beneficial, however. For example, the replenishment of beaches is dependent upon sediment deposits from rivers. 
<p>
The USDA estimates that putting 30 to 40 million acres of highly erodible U.S. cropland out of production and into the Conservation Reserve Program will reduce sediment delivery to surface waters by as much as 200 million tons per year.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#16">(16)</A>
<p>
Texas has no data that show whether various erosion control strategies have reduced sedimentation in Texas surface waters. The Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board states that "soil erosion and sediment production continue to be major problems in Texas," though it speculates that there has been significant improvement in the last few decades.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#17">(17)</A> The Board, lead agency for non-point source pollution from agriculture, has recommended expanded stream and reservoir sedimentation studies, stating that past studies have been incomplete.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#18">(18)</A>
<p>
According to the Texas Water Development Board, sediment buildup in reservoirs has not caused a major water supply problem to date, but the agency continues to monitor the situation. The TWDB studies show that Lake Buchanan in Central Texas does have noticeable amounts of sediment as does Lake Corpus Christi.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#19">(19)</A>   
<p>
In Texas, average annual sediment yields - that portion of the total eroded soil that reaches a reservoir - vary from one land resource area to another and vary within land resource areas. According to a USDA study, sediment yields have varied from a low of 0.6 acre-foot per square mile at a site west of Lampasas to a high of 8.60 acre-feet per square mile at a site northeast of Bowie in Montague county.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#20">(20)</A>

</H4>
<p>
One of the best treatments for highly erodible land is to take it out of production and plant grass cover.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#21">(21)</A> To speed this practice along, the 1985 Farm Bill's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was formulated to provide financial incentives to farmers who voluntarily take highly erodible cropland and other environmentally fragile land (e.g., wetlands, wildlife habitat) out of production for ten years. This means no haying, grazing or harvesting of the land. Though there is a 25 percent cap per county on the amount of land that can be eligible, the program does provide farmers with the opportunity to receive $40 per acre per year rental fee to retire land and a 50/50 cost-share payment to plant a permanent soil-conserving cover.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#22">(22)</A> 
<p>
Cropland retired under the CRP was eroding at 13 tons per acre per year. After taking it out of production and establishing coverage, the rate of erosion is 2 tons per year.  
<p>
With 4.2 million acres - 12 percent of all cropland - in the Conservation Reserve Program, Texas has more land in the program than any other state.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#23">(23)</A> (Due to the amount of cropland in production, Texas, of course, has more potential acres to be in the CRP.)      
<p>
In 1993, Texas producers received $164 million in rental fees, and approximately $100 million in cost sharing from the inception of the program in 1986 to 1993 in return for taking more than 4 million acres out of production and converting it to grass. The average one-time cost share for establishing grass cover is $25 per acre. More than 80 percent of the CRP acreage is in the High Plains and Rolling Plains. Reduced erosion - an estimated 22 percent reduction on U.S. cropland since 1985 - is not the only benefit of the Conservation Reserve Program. Environmental benefits include improvement in air and water quality and an increase in wildlife habitat for game and nongame birds, mammals and reptiles. Soil conservation specialists in Terry and Lubbock counties report a noticeable reduction in wind erosion and change in air quality as well as an increase in wildlife since cropland has been enrolled in the CRP.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#24">(24)</A>  The Environmental Working Group notes that the CRP has saved the state 144.8 million tons of soil annually.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#25">(25)</A> 
<p>
The <I>Wall Street Journal </I>reports that the CRP program has its critics. The average age of landowners participating in the program is 64, leading some to believe that it is a "welfare plan" for retired farmers. Others complain that too much good farmland has been allowed in the CRP program. Meanwhile, there are residents of the Texas Panhandle who complain that taking 20 percent of the Plains farmland out of production has devastated related businesses, such as cotton gins and seed, pesticide and equipment dealers.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#26">(26)</A> There has also been criticism about the high cost of the CRP. CRP proponents suggest, however, if farmers who are currently enrolled in the CRP were growing rice, cotton, grains and other crops eligible for income supports, their deficiency payments would be equal to, if not more than, the CRP costs.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#27">(27)</A> In addition, the USDA estimates the CRP's environmental benefits at between $6 billion and $13 billion over the life of the contracts.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#28">(28)</A> 
<p>
Unless extended, the CRP program will begin to phase out in 1995. Much of the acreage now enrolled in the CRP will revert to row crop and forage production. A study conducted by Texas Tech University's Department of Agricultural Economics found that, in 55 counties in the Plains, economic considerations will encourage farmers to return 64 percent of the land to crop production unless the CRP is extended.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#29">(29)</A>  This is not just the prediction for Texas; according to the Soil and Water and Conservation Society the return of CRP land to production will occur nationwide.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#30">(30)</A> A revised CRP program that targets truly erodible land for inclusion might be presented to Congress in 1995.  
<p>
The other major erosion-abatement provision created by the 1985 Food Security Act is the Conservation Compliance Provision. This provision required farmers who had highly erodible land and who wanted to retain eligibility for government program benefits to implement a conservation plan and have it approved by the Soil Conservation Service by December 31, 1994.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#31">(31)</A>   
<p>
Conservation tillage is one good example of mature conservation practices.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#32">(32)</A>  According to the Conservation Technology Information Center, a not-for-profit organization that provides research on soil conservation, 22.4 percent (4,482,961 acres) of Texas cropland is in conservation tillage.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#33">(33)</A> Conservation tillage is expected to increase as a means to meet the requirements of the conservation compliance provision, but experts suggest that continued research is needed to better understand its effects and to determine which types of crops respond best.<A HREF="NOTES5.HTML#34">(34)</A>

<H5>Texas Environmental Almanac, Chapter 6, Air 
Quality, Page 4</H5>
<P>

<A NAME="ACT"><H4>FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT COMPLIANCE IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
Under Title 1 of the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act, any area that violates National Ambient Air Quality Standards for any of the six criteria pollutants as few as once per year and as often as four times over a three-year period is classified as a "non-attainment area." Texas currently has four such areas, encompassing 17 counties. Victoria County and portions of Bexar County have been designated "unclassified" because their monitoring data for ozone and lead, respectively, have not been adequate to measure pollution levels precisely. The Houston Ship Channel in the Houston metropolitan area had been proposed as a non-attainment area for sulfur dioxide. However, recent cooperative activities by the TNRCC, EPA and industries in the area resulted in the submission of an attainment demonstration to the EPA.
<P>
Non-attainment areas for ozone, CO and PM10 are classified according to the severity of their air pollution. Each area is included in a State Implementation Plan (SIP) designed by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission to bring the area into compliance. Different areas may have different deadlines for complying with the SIP plan, depending upon the severity of their air pollution problem. If a non-attainment area fails to comply with air pollution standards by the deadline, the Environmental Protection Agency may extend the deadline, but impose more stringent requirements to meet the standards. If there is a failure to develop a proper State Implementation Plan or a failure to implement the plan, the Environmental Protection Agency may develop a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for the area and may impose sanctions for non-compliance including the loss of federal highway funds, bans or stiffer limits on further industrial expansion and the loss of federal Air Pollution Control Program grant funds. 
<P>
The economic costs of non-attainment are substantial. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission estimates that it will cost $200 billion to bring Texas' four ozone non-attainment areas into compliance.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#42">(42)</A> By 1996, the four ozone non-attainment areas must reduce levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by 15 percent, net of growth, from 1990 levels. This net reduction requirement means that before any new sources of VOCs can be allowed to operate, reductions must be made in existing sources to offset the new emissions. Thus, the actual total reduction is significantly higher than 15 percent. 
<P>
Once volatile organic compounds are reduced by 15 percent by 1996, serious and severely polluted areas - which include Houston, El Paso and Beaumont - will still be required to reduce either volatile organic compounds and/or nitrogen oxides an average of 3 percent each year for three years, or until standards are met. Thus, future economic growth and reductions in air pollution are linked together. 
<P>
The State Implementation Plan is also requiring consumers, small businesses and major industries in non-attainment areas to radically alter their activities. For example, in non-attainment areas, the following programs, many of which are still undergoing refinement, are being required:
<UL>
<LI> Under the state's most recent plan to control ozone pollution, automobile owners would be required to have emissions from their vehicles tested every two years. Vehicles that do not meet emission standards would have to be repaired at the owner's expense. However, in 1995, the Texas Legislature passed a statewide moratorium on inspections to reconsider the program. Still, some sort of vehicle emission testing will likely be required in non-attainment areas.
<P><LI> Service stations are required to install equipment to control gasoline vapors at the pump and as fuel is being unloaded into storage tanks. Most stations were to comply by 1994; smaller stations that were built before 1992 and sell less than 10,000 gallons of gasoline per month are exempt. 
<P><LI> The Houston/Galveston area residents will have to use only reformulated gasoline, a cleaner-burning fuel.
<P><LI> The Houston/Galveston area must reduce the number of cars and trucks commuting to and from work through an employer trip reduction program. The program has been delayed six months by actions of the Legislature and Governor, however.
<P><LI> El Paso residents will have to use oxygenated gasoline to reduce carbon monoxide emissions.
<P><LI> Specific industries will be required to install pollution-control equipment beyond what is required under current regulations.
<P><LI> Small businesses like dry cleaners, paint shops, printers and autobody shops will have to install pollution-control equipment.
<P><LI> In El Paso, Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston/Galveston, industrial wastewater systems will be required to cover wastewater treatment areas and route the vapors through a control device.
<P><LI> All new or expanding major industries in a non-attainment area must apply for non-attainment source review permits, which are more stringent than attainment area permits, known as prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) permits.
<P><LI> The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission has designated five other metropolitan areas as "near non-attainment" areas. These areas are: Austin, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Victoria, and the Tyler/Longview/Marshall area. They are called near non-attainment because they have on occasion exceeded standards, because they were once non-attainment areas but have since come into compliance, or because of their potential for future growth. In 1993, for example, both Tyler/Longview/Marshall and Corpus Christi exceeded ozone standards for a single day - not enough to cause the cities to go out of compliance, but cause for concern. The state and local officials are working on voluntary programs in these and other cities to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds.
</UL>
<P>
Because the Clean Air Act limits growth in non-attainment areas by requiring that existing companies offset any new emissions, new industries may be inclined to locate in cities without immediate pollution problems. This growth could cause an increase in emissions of VOCs and nitrogen oxides in these cities, and could cause them eventually to exceed federal air-quality standards. 
<P>
The criteria pollutants covered by the Federal Clean Air Act are not the only pollutants. Air toxics, greenhouse gases, ozone-depleting chemicals and a wide variety of indoor air particulates are also of great concern.

<tr><th>ACHIEVING CLEAN AIR IS A BINATIONAL PROBLEM FOR EL PASO
</TH></TR><TR><TD>
El Paso is the only city in Texas in violation of national standards for both respirable particulate matter and carbon monoxide. The city is also designated as a "serious" non-attainment area for ozone. El Paso has been in compliance with national standards for nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and, since 1986, with lead standards. 
<P>
El Paso and other cities along the Texas/Mexico border face unique pollution problems because environmental standards differ on the two sides of the border. In fact, air pollution originating in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, Mexico - which lies in a desert valley across the Rio Grande River from El Paso - may contribute as much or more to overall air pollution in El Paso than pollution originating on the U.S. side of the border. These two cities, along with Sunland Park, New Mexico, share a common airshed in a valley characterized by the Rio Grande River and surrounding moun-tain peaks. Temperature inversions in the area contribute to air pollution problems. 
<P>
A 1990 joint study by the EPA, Texas Air Control Board, El Paso City/County Health Department and Mexican authorities found that the highest concentrations of particulate matter occurred in urban Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez and in the mountain pass along the border.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#43">(43)</A> The principle sources of carbon monoxide, particulate matter and ozone in the area include motor vehicles, industries located in the airshed and open burning of domes-tic and agricultural waste. 
<P>
A problem specific to the area is the large number of vehicles waiting to enter or exit the United States from Mexico. The El Paso - Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez border crossing is one of the busiest crossings along the border. Each vehicle crossing the border, about 40 percent of which have Mexican license plates, must wait at least 10 minutes at the border while their paperwork is processed. Vehicles at idle produce higher emissions. Mexican vehicles, because they are older and often have less stringent maintenance and emission controls, tend to be higher emitters.
<P>
If the TNRCC can prove that pollution emanating from outside the United States prevents El Paso's compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for any of the criteria pollutants - ozone, carbon monoxide and particulate matter - then the city will not bump up to a severe non-attainment area if the attainment deadlines are not met. This dispensation would also keep the city from suffering federal sanctions including the loss of federal highway funds and construction grants. However, El Paso will still have to adopt stringent pollution control rules to comply with the FCAA.
<P>
For the past two years, state and local officials, environmental groups and business interests from the U.S. and Mexico have been working on the concept of an International Air Quality Management District encompassing the two cities and surrounding areas. Under one proposal, the District would coordinate monitoring and set caps on emissions within the airshed, while also allowing for flexibility to meet these standards. For example, rather than investing in expensive pollution con-trol equipment, new businesses in El Paso might offset their emissions by instead investing in a similar facility in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, or helping pave Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez streets.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#44">(44)</A>

<P>
Air toxics is a term which describes a broad group of non-criteria pollutants including NESHAP pollutants (hazardous air pollutants regulated by National Emission Standards established and enforced by the EPA), workplace pollutants, state-regulated pollutants, toxics compounds covered by the Toxics Release Inventory Program and other toxic pollutants addressed by the Federal Clean Air Act. While total emissions of these compounds are small compared to the criteria air pollutants - they are usually measured in pounds, not tons - their potential impact on human health can be great, especially for individuals living near a source of emissions or a spill release. Upon inhalation, air toxics are brought into the lungs, where some are readily absorbed into the blood stream. Some air toxics can also irritate sensitive tissues in the eyes, throat and nose. Some may cause cancer in humans. Others may cause reproductive dysfunctions, birth defects or nervous system disorders. 
<P>
The 1986 Superfund Authorization and Renewal Act requires businesses to report all releases into the air, water, or ground of more than 300 toxic chemicals and 20 toxic chemical compounds. These data are compiled into the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). Recently, the EPA added an additional 286 chemicals to the list of chemicals which must be reported by manufacturing industries.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#45">(45)</A> Texas leads the nation in air toxics releases, accounting in 1992 for about 7.5 percent of all toxic air emissions nationwide.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#46">(46)</A> However, between 60 percent and two-thirds of the nation's petrochemical capacity occurs in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#47">(47)</A>
<P>
Industrial toxics emissions are just part of total toxic air emissions. In 1991, the Texas Air Control Board estimated that these releases accounted for only 18 percent of total toxic air emissions, while mobile sources - automobiles, motorcycles, pickups, vans and trucks -  accounted for 24 percent. "Area sources" - dry cleaners, solvent and paint shops and wastewater treatment plants among others - emit up to three times the amount of toxics emitted statewide by major industries.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#48">(48)</A> Still, the contribution of total air toxic emissions of each of these categories - industrial, mobile and area sources - varies widely with location.
<P>
The EPA has had the authority to set standards for hazardous air pollutants since 1970. Because of sparse medical data, however, the EPA has faced numerous legal challenges in adopting regulatory measures. Through 1993, the list of NESHAPS - national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants- stood at seven, and included the following chemicals: asbestos, beryllium, arsenic, mercury, benzene, vinyl chloride and radionuclides. 
<P>
In 1990, the new Federal Clean Air Act directed the EPA to control industrial emissions for 189 toxic chemicals with potential effects ranging from chronic respiratory effects to cancer to reproductive dysfunctions. The EPA must designate control-technology standards for 174 types of facilities that emit one or more of the 189 listed hazardous air pollutants. Standards for 39 sources were due by November, 1994.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#49">(49)</A> In some cases, EPA will establish the specific type of technology to be used to limit releases of pollutants; in others, industry will have flexibility in determining which type of technology they use to meet emission requirements.  
<P>
For those compounds not classified as criteria pollutants or with national emission standards (NESHAPs), air toxicologists and regulators at the TNRCC have conducted site-specific reviews of predicted or actual impacts for potential adverse effects. "Effects Screening Levels" (ambient air concentration guidelines, or ESLs) are used to gauge the potential of toxics air emissions associated with expansion of an existing facility or construction of a new facility to cause adverse health or welfare effects.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#50">(50)</A> 
<P>
Screening levels are set to protect against health effects, odor nuisance, effects on vegetation or corrosive effects, and are set to protect the more sensitive members of the general public. If, during the permit review process, the TNRCC determines that proposed emissions may result in exposure of the general public outside of the facility to concentrations of air pollutants at levels above these screening levels, the Commission may either deny the permit or require pollution control equipment as a permit provision.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#51">(51)</A> 
<P>
These health-based screening levels are controversial. Since each screening level is based upon the effects of a single chemical, simultaneous exposure to several air pollutants (each of which may have a similar effect on health) may not be adequately addressed.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#52">(52)</A> The Toxicology and Risk Assessment Section at the TNRCC are aware of this potential for additive effects, but believe that the ESLs are conservative enough to protect against this effect in the vast majority of cases. In special cases, additional review is conducted as needed.
<P>
Another criticism is that ESLs do not address specifically the potential accumulation in the environment, over time, of compounds like DDTs, PCBs and metals. Although many toxics can degrade or be washed out of the environment in a short time, a few compounds are not readily degraded, and may accumulate in the tissue of lower organisms, then eventually in fish, birds and even mammals such as humans. In the review of impacts of these chemicals, this potential is considered.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#53">(53)</A> 
<P>
While Texas keeps an extensive air toxic emission inventory - how many pounds are actually emitted in the air - there is much less data on levels of toxics in the ambient air. In 1992, the TNRCC established the Community Air Toxics Monitoring Program, a network of 15 monitoring sites that will eventually expand to 50 sites.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#54">(54)</A> The 15 sites have analyzed air samples for 19 volatile organic compounds. In both 1992 and 1993, benzene, a human carcinogen, was the only compound consistently detected at levels above the effects screening levels, and was detected at eight of the 15 sites.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#55">(55)</A> 
<P>
The TNRCC determined, however, that the benzene measurements that exceeded the 24-hour ESLs would not increase the risk of short term adverse health effects. The TNRCC further concluded that, while long-term exposure to benzene at levels significantly greater than the annual ESL may increase the lifetime risk of developing leukemia or affect the formation of blood, measured levels of benzene have significantly decreased over the past 10 years.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#56">(56)</A> 
<P>
Benzene is a constituent of gasoline; it is released from cars during refueling and is a component of car exhaust. Benzene is also released during industrial refining processes and from benzene storage tanks. In Texas, the counties along the Gulf Coast have the greatest number of sources of benzene because of the large number of petrochemical companies and petroleum refineries.
<P>
Another compound - 1,2 dibromoethane - exceeded its screening levels at two sites in Houston, and at sites in El Paso and Midlothian during the monitoring period running from October 1992 through September 1993.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#57">(57)</A> It is released to the atmosphere primarily through its use as a pesticide and as a fuel additive for gasoline. The manufacture of 1,2 dibromoethane has declined in recent years because its use as a fumigant has been banned and because the decline in lead-content of gasoline has resulted in a decline in its use as a fuel additive. While 24-hour concentrations did exceed the established ESL standards at these sites, they were not high enough to result in acute health effects according to TNRCC criteria. Nonetheless, yearly screening levels were exceeded.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#58">(58)</A>
<P>
The TNRCC, partly in response to legislative and citizen concerns about potential health effects of air toxics, has initiated special purpose studies at several sites around Texas. For example, after noticing high levels of arsenic in ambient air analyses in El Paso, the state initiated a special study in 1993 near the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO). The Vilas Elementary School, about two miles southwest of the plant, was the site chosen for the study. The study showed that arsenic levels consistently exceeded both the annual and 24-hour screening levels. By comparing test results to levels measured when the ASARCO plant was shut down for a strike in 1980, the state concluded that the high arsenic levels were because of plant activity. During a permit hearing, the company agreed to reduce arsenic emissions by a factor of ten.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#59">(59)</A>

<A NAME="GREEN">GREENHOUSE EFFECT</A>
</H4>
<P>
One reason the earth is warm enough to support life is that carbon dioxide and other gases in the upper atmosphere act as a kind of transparent umbrella, allowing sunlight to pass through, then trapping the heat below. This intricate but natural process is known as the greenhouse effect. 
<P>
With increased burning of coal, oil, and natural gas over the past century and with the destruction of much of the earth's forest cover, the greenhouse effect may be intensifying. The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, some of which is used by trees and other vegetation during photosynthesis and some of which is absorbed by the oceans. When vast amounts of carbon dioxide are being produced and less is being used by plants, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases. This accumulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (methane, ozone, nitrous oxides, and chlorofluorocarbons) in earth's atmosphere may be causing the average temperature around the globe to rise, a phenomenon referred to as "global warming."
<P>
The environmental implications of global warming are serious. Higher average temperatures could hasten melting of the polar ice caps, raising sea levels and distorting rainfall patterns. Coastal cities and plant and animal habitat could be destroyed. An alteration of climate could also reduce crop production. However, there may also be some benefits derived. 
<P>
Scientists like James Hansen, of NASA's Goddard Institute, believe that the Earth is already experiencing an enhanced greenhouse effect. For example, six of the hottest years in recorded history occurred in the last decade.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#60">(60)</A> And studies have shown a correlation between the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and a rise in global temperature.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#61">(61)</A>
<P>
There is considerable debate about the phenomenon of global warming. Critics like Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology believe while carbon dioxide accumulation may lead to warming climates, the actual impacts of warming will be mitigated by other factors. For instance, the increase in soot, sulfuric acid and particulate matter in the atmosphere, which help scatter light away from the earth, may be counteracting temperature increases that would otherwise occur from the accumulation of greenhouse gases. Still other scientists believe that temperature fluctuations are a normal occurence, attributable to such events as sun spots, and that techniques for measuring temperature are not accurate enough to permit scientists to design proper models of global temperature. Other scientists have developed climactic models which indicate a movement toward a severe cooling period. 
<P>
Overall, global temperatures have increased about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the last 130 years. But the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the World Meteorological Society have both projected that by the year 2050, the average surface temperature will increase an additional 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#62">(62)</A> The effects of these increases would be felt unevenly around the globe, with temperature changing less at the equator than at higher latitudes.
<P>
To delay or prevent global warming, world and national leaders have called for a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, to be accomplished through a shift away from the use of oil, gas and coal and toward the use of more renewable energy sources like solar power.
<P>
In Texas, climatic changes predicted as a result of global warming could profoundly alter how Texans live and work. In Dallas, for example, if IPCC predictions are true, the number of days when the temperature reaches 100 degrees F could increase from 19 to 78 per year by 2050. In central Texas, average temperatures could go up five degrees during the same period.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#63">(63)</A> Water levels would also be affected. Rainfall would decline in most areas and the hotter temperatures would increase the rate of evaporation, resulting in a reduced water supply. Coastal areas would likely face more intense rainfall, however, as clouds forming from increased evaporation of ocean waters gave rise to more violent storms. Low-level areas along the coast would be subject to more flooding from increased rainfall and rising sea levels.
<P>
Texas may, however, also derive some positive benefits from warmer annual temperatures. One of these effects is that milder winters may reduce the risk of freezes which cripple citrus crops.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#64">(64)</A> 
<P>
Although there are currently no guidelines or limits in international law relating to greenhouse gases other than CFCs, there is growing awareness that the problem must be addressed. Many of the nations that are signatories to the Montreal Protocol are currently discussing the possibility of an international "law of the atmosphere" that would establish limits on the release of several greenhouse gases<B>.</B><A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#65">(65)</A> 
<P>
With only 5 percent of the world's population, the United States produces 23.4 percent of the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels. Texas alone produces more carbon dioxide than either the United Kingdom or Canada.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#66">(66)</A> The state emitted an estimated 550 million metric tons in 1988 from all sources.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#67">(67)</A>
<P>

Texas depends heavily on fossil fuels both to power cars and to generate electricity. Texas utilities, for example, contributed 159 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 1991, or about 30 percent of all greenhouse gases emitted. Without major changes in how Texas produces its energy, these levels are expected to continue. For a full discussion of energy use and energy policy in Texas, see the section entitled "Energy."

<H4>HOW THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT WORKS</H4>
<IMG SRC="g.greenhouse.gif" BORDER=4 ALIGN=middle ALT="Graphic of Greenhouse Effect">
</center><P>
<OL>
	<LI>  Most of the sun's energy reaches the Earth.  (The ozone layer shields the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.) 
	<LI>  About 30 percent of the energy is reflected back into space. 
	<LI>  Burning of fossil fuels and deforestation increase carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Added to this are chloroflourocarbons (man-made gases used in spray cans, refrigerants and insulations) and methane (from landfills, farming and swamps). 
	<LI>  Together, these gases form a "blanket" which traps energy, thus warming the Earth.

<A NAME="STRATO">DECREASING STRATOSPHERIC OZONE</A>
</H4>
<P>
Chlorinated fluorocarbons, or CFCs is the name given to a family of chemicals developed in 1928 by DuPont under the name Freon. Today, CFCs are used for refrigeration and air conditioning, as well as in the manufacture of aerosol sprays, computer chips, and many other products. When released into the air, these chemicals eventually rise to the stratosphere where they are broken down by sunlight. This degradation process releases chlorine, which damages the layer of atmospheric ozone that absorbs most of the sun's ultraviolet-B radiation. The destructive influence of CFCs high in the atmosphere is significant: a single chlorine atom can lead to the destruction of more than 100,000 ozone molecules.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#68">(68)</A>
<P>
Destruction of the ozone layer appears to be increasing. In the spring of 1985, British scientists found a hole about the size of the continental U.S. in the ozone layer over the Antarctica. This hole has reappeared each spring when meteorological conditions facilitate the breakdown in ozone. In 1992, satellite images recorded global ozone levels 4 percent lower than normal. Meanwhile, the concentration of CFCs measured in the atmo-sphere continues to climb.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#69">(69)</A> Use of other "ozone-depleters" like halons, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and hydrochloroflourocarbons (HCFCs) has also been on the rise.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#70">(70)</A> The high levels of ultraviolet-B radiation reaching the earth as a result of ozone depletion have been shown to increase the incidence of skin cancer and cataracts in humans. This radiation also adversely affects the environment. 
<P>
Because of the danger CFCs pose to the ozone layer, the Clean Air Act requires a phase-out of the production of CFCs and halons by the year 2000. Interim substitutes, such as HCFCs, will also be eventually phased out. In Texas, major industries still release millions of pounds of ten chemicals EPA has identified as ozone-depleters. Still, most CFCs do not come from industrial sources but rather from refrigerants, automobile air conditioning and solvents in oil-based paints.

<A NAME="INDOOR">INDOOR AIR POLLUTION</A>
</H4>
<P>
The air we breathe indoors, whether at home, in our cars or at work, may represent a bigger pollution problem than outdoor air pollution. With people spending up to 90 percent of their time indoors, the quantity and severity of health problems related to indoor air quality has probably increased over the last 10 years.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#71">(71)</A> For example, in a December 1989 report, the EPA compared the risks of 20 different environmental problems and found that indoor air pollution posed the greatest health risk, though it had the least amount of federal money dedicated to it.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#72">(72)</A>
<P>
The severity of indoor air pollution is aggravated by the fact that new buildings are being built more tightly to save money spent on heating and cooling. Because these tightly sealed, more energy efficient buildings prevent the exchange of outside/inside air, they reduce the amount of fresh air in a building. At the same time, people are using more and more irritating products such as hair sprays, pesticides and cleaning detergents. The combination of a lack of ventilation and heavy use of such materials can be dangerous. In Texas, the Department of Health's Indoor Air Quality Branch is responsible for responding to indoor air-quality complaints, providing on-site investigations, educating the public about indoor air quality health problems and suggesting methods to alleviate indoor air quality problems.
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> During FY 1992, the Texas Department of Health's Indoor Air Quality Branch received over 3,000 requests for information, responded to indoor air-quality complaints from 124 schools, buildings and residences, and performed more than 257 on-site investigations, including 130 private residences. For more information, please call the Occupational Health Division at the Department of Health at 512-834-6600.

<P>
The American Lung Association has estimated that indoor air pollution costs businesses over $100 billion dollars a year because of death, sick days, direct medical costs, loss of productivity and damage to materials and equipment. The Environmental Protection Agency projects that 3,500 to 6,500 deaths a year are the result of the effects of indoor air pollutants.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#73">(73)</A> The causes of these deaths include cancer and coronary heart disease caused by exposure to radon, paints, solvents and second-hand tobacco smoke. 
<P>
Indoor air pollution is suspected to be one of the leading causes of health problems largely because of seven pollutants: environmental tobacco smoke, volatile organic compounds, radon, microorganisms, pesticides, asbestos and lead. In 1989, EPA Administrator William K. Reilly asked an independent team of scientists known as the Science Advisory Board to assess and compare different environmental risks using recent scientific data. The group found that indoor air quality problems from environmental (second-hand) tobacco smoke, radon and six volatile organic compounds often found indoors in solvents, paints and gasoline products represented one of four problems posing "relatively high human health risks."<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#74">(74)</A>
<P>
Radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas, is responsible for an estimated 10 percent of lung cancer deaths. This colorless, odorless gas occurs everywhere at low levels, but it becomes a concern when it is trapped in buildings with little ventilation. Radon gas may enter homes built on soils or rocks containing high levels of uranium, which is the most common source of the gas, or through cracks or other openings in basements or ground floors. Studies by the EPA indicate that as many as 10 percent of U.S. homes may have elevated radon levels.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#75">(75)</A> A 1992 study by the TDH monitored indoor air for radon in about 2,700 homes across Texas. The TDH found four areas with a high potential for radon: the West Texas Panhandle Region; the Big Bend area; the Llano Uplift area; and inland from the coastal bend in South Texas.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#76">(76)</A>
<P>
Microorganisms - bacteria, viruses and fungi - can cause serious illnesses such as Legionnaire's Disease, asthma, influenza and other infectious diseases.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#77">(77)</A> These microorganisms can grow in humid buildings, as well as in bedding or the litter of household pets, and without proper ventilation, can easily infect occupants. More subtle health effects, commonly known as "sick building syndrome," include headaches, irritation of eyes, nose and respiratory tract, loss of memory, fatigue and drowsiness. An EPA survey of office workers across the nation found that 19 percent of respondents sometimes had difficulty performing work because of poor indoor air quality.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#78">(78)</A>
<P>
Indoor exposure to pesticides, asbestos and lead all affect human health, particularly the health of young children. The practice of sanding or open-flame burning of lead-based paints, which were in common use before 1978, emits compounds that can impair mental and physical development in both fetuses and young children. Using 1990 census data, the EPA determined that 3.5 million homes in Texas contain some lead-based paint. Based upon these figures, the EPA estimates that 1,949,696 children six years old or under have the potential to be exposed to lead poisoning.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#79">(79)</A> 
<P>
Pesticides in the home or office can irritate eyes, nose and throat and may damage the central nervous system or may even lead to an increased risk of cancer. According to an EPA survey, nine out of ten U.S. households have used pesticides.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#80">(80)</A> Chlordane, dieldrin and other chemicals used to kill termites have been banned or their indoor use severely restricted in part because they remain active for such long periods. Also, several types of asbestos products, made from a mineral fiber used as an insulator and fire-retardant, have been banned by the EPA because they can cause chest and lung cancer as well as a condition known as asbestosis, an irreversible lung scarring which can be fatal.<A HREF="NOTES6.HTML#81">(81)</A> Elevated concentrations of asbestos can occur indoors when asbestos-containing materials are disturbed by remodeling or demolition activities.

<A NAME="COAL">COAL</A>
</H4>
<P>
By the time white settlers arrived in Texas, indigenous tribes had been burning coal for many millennia. Between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago, tribal groups near Lake Lewisville were using lignite to heat their homes and cook their food. Archaeological sites in Bastrop County contain burned lignite dating back 5,000 years. Throughout the early 1800s settlers utilized coal they found on the surface and by 1850, small scale mining had begun. 
<P>
Today, Texas leads the nation in coal consumption by a large margin. In 1993, Texas used 96 million tons of coal. By comparison, Indiana, the number two coal-consuming state, used about 60 million tons of coal.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#53">(53)</A> Nearly 95 percent of the coal consumed in Texas was used to generate electricity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#54">(54)</A> 
<P>
Texas mines produce two-thirds of the coal consumed in the state. Some 56 million tons of lignite are mined in Texas annually. The sixth and twelfth largest coal mines in America are located in Texas. The Martin Lake and Monticello mines, both owned by Texas Utilities Mining Co., together produce nearly 25 million tons of lignite per year.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#55">(55)</A> 
<P>
Texas has more than 24 billion tons of lignite that can be recovered through conventional strip mining methods. At current rates of production, Texas' coal supply will last about 400 years.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#56">(56)</A> In addition, the state contains another 35 billion tons of coal in deep reserves. All told, the state's coal deposits contain the energy equivalent of more than 100 billion barrels of oil. 
<P>
Coal consumption in Texas is rising faster than any other form of energy. By 2030, the state's coal consumption is expected to be about 180 million tons per year, twice as much as the state consumed in 1990.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#57">(57)</A> However, the state's appetite for coal has caused serious pollution problems around the state. Five of the top ten sources of air pollution in the state are coal-fired electric power plants.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#58">(58)</A> Studies have linked elevated selenium levels in a number of East Texas Lakes with nearby coal-fired power plants.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#59">(59)</A> 
<P>
Burning coal also produces sulfur dioxide, an air pollutant that can cause acid rain. Acid rain poses a serious threat to East Texas lakes, which have little ability to counter acidic input.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#60">(60)</A> In addition to the air quality problems presented by coal consumption, strip mining presents a range of problems. Since 1982, more than 52,000 acres of land in the state has been strip mined for lignite.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#61">(61)</A> Adequate reclamation of strip mined property is expensive and time consuming. Often, sites are re-planted with just one type of plant material. Biologists point out that the resulting monoculture does not support a diversity of wildlife.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#62">(62)</A> In addition, the strip mined land can be subject to subsidence and erosion.

<A NAME="ELECTRICITY">ELECTRICITY</A>
</H4>
<P>
The Texas economy is changing. The service sector and light manufacturing companies are growing rapidly. The new, high-technology companies rely on computers and the microchip to speed information and products to consumers. But the emerging information economy depends on electric power. So do our air conditioners, answering machines, personal computers, microwave ovens, tape recorders and a panoply of other consumer products.
<P>
The burgeoning Texas economy and the state's rapidly growing population have caused a surge in demand for electricity. From 1970 to 1990, electricity consumption in Texas more than doubled.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#63">(63)</A> Without a change in the pattern of consumption or major conservation efforts, the demand for electricity in Texas will require utilities to build 90 new power plants over the next 15 years.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#64">(64)</A> These new plants could increase the state's electrical capacity by almost 25 percent.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#65">(65)</A> 
<P>
Texas produces and consumes more electricity than any other state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#66">(66)</A> In 1991, Texans paid $14 billion for electricity while consuming 241 million megawatt hours of electricity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#67">(67)</A> Twenty-seven electric utilities are currently operating 312 generating stations in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#68">(68)</A> These facilities have a combined net capacity of 60,687 megawatts. Of the 27 utilities, nine are investor-owned, five are electric cooperatives, five are federal or state agencies and eight are owned by municipalities. 
<P>
Much of the new demand for electric power is coming from the residential sector, where electricity consumption is growing rapidly. In 1970, electricity accounted for 32 percent of the energy needs in the average home. By 1990, electricity supplied 54 percent of residential energy needs. By the year 2000, that figure is expected to rise to 56 percent and by the year 2030, electricity may supply 61 percent of all home energy needs.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#69">(69)</A> 
<P>
In 1992, Texas residents paid about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#70">(70)</A> The Public Utilities Commission of Texas estimates that by the year 2000, consumers will be paying 10.4 cents per kilowatt hour.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#71">(71)</A> In addition to the rising cost of electricity, Texas is facing environmental problems caused by electricity production. Texas is the country's largest consumer of coal (more than 90 million tons per year), and the power plants that burn coal pump millions of tons of carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide (which can cause acid rain), nitrogen oxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere every year. (See Air Chapter for further discussion.)
<P>
In 1977, natural gas accounted for 86 percent of the fuel used to generate electric power in Texas. But in 1978, Congress passed the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act, which required utilities to phase out the use of natural gas as a boiler fuel by 1990. Designed as a response to perceived natural gas shortages, this requirement was later repealed when new gas supplies were discovered. However, by then, many Texas utility companies had begun developing coal supplies, which were viewed as a way to diversify their power-generation base. Today, about 40 percent of all the electricity consumed in Texas is derived from the burning of natural gas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#72">(72)</A> Half of the state's electricity is derived from burning coal. The balance comes from nuclear power, hydropower and renewables. 
<P>
In 1990, electric power generation in the state produced 66 percent of the total sulfur dioxides, 37 percent of total nitrogen oxides and 35 percent of all the carbon dioxide emitted into the air in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#73">(73)</A> As noted above, coal-fired power plants have been linked to acidification in several East Texas lakes. The same lakes have also been contaminated by selenium, a heavy metal linked to the coal-fired power plants. 
<P>
The question of global warming has also not been fully assessed. Scientists from around the world believe that carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere will cause a gradual warming of the Earth, which could have catastrophic effects on agriculture and coastal zones. Fossil fuel-fired electric power plants produce millions of tons of CO2 per year. (See section on air). Some environmental groups favor new regulations that would change the way Texas' electric utilities operate. Called integrated resource planning, the program would encourage utilities to increase efficiency programs. In addition, it would require utilities to take into account the cost of the pollutants that they emit. Many other states, including Nevada, Oregon and New York have adopted similar regulations. But thus far, the Texas Legislature has not required Texas power producers to factor efficiency and pollution issues into their decision-making process. 
<P>
Advances in efficiency could help slow the demand for electricity. High efficiency appliances, lights and motors could go a long way toward reducing Texas' demand for electricity. (See efficiency section below).

Because of its clean burning characteristics, however, gas is expected to increase its share to 42 percent by 2002.

<A NAME="COGENERATION">Cogeneration </A>
</H4>
<P>
Electricity is inherently inefficient to produce. Up to two-thirds of the heat energy in a fuel source is lost while making electric power. Cogeneration is a process that generates electricity and heat at the same time. Cogeneration units are up to 50 percent more efficient than standard power plants.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#74">(74)</A> Industrial users were among the first to embrace cogeneration because it allows large industrial plants to generate electricity while using the heat for industrial processes. In addition, cogeneration units are advocated by some energy analysts because they are cheaper to build than large power units.
<P>
Between 1980 and 1992, the amount of electricity derived from cogeneration has increased tenfold.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#75">(75)</A> Texas now gets more than 7,300 megawatts of power from cogeneration plants. At present, 80 percent of the state's cogeneration plants are operated by petrochemical and chemical producers along the Gulf Coast. 
<P>
Federal regulations require local utilities to purchase excess power from cogeneration facilities. And because of its efficiency, cogeneration is expected to increase. By 2005, some 10,000 megawatts of cogeneration capacity are predicted to be available in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#76">(76)</A>

<H4>TEXAS ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION BY SECTOR</H4>
<IMG SRC="c.econsumpt.gif" BORDER=4 ALIGN=middle ALT="Bar Chart of Electricity Consumption by Sector">
</center>
<P>
Utilities in Texas sold $14.7 billion worth of electricity to 7.7 million customers in 1992. Texas' 59,000 industrial users, only one percent of all customers, provided one-quarter of all revenues and used more than one-third of all power sold.
<P>
Total electricity consumed in 1992: 239.4 trillion kilowatt hours. One kilowatt hour equals the energy consumed by ten 100 watt light bulbs burning for one hour.

<H4>
<A NAME="NUCLEAR">Nuclear Power</A>
</H4>
<P>
In 1942, Dr. Enrico Fermi assembled enough uranium to cause a nuclear fission reaction. Nine years later, in 1951, the first electric power was produced from the atom, when an experimental reactor lit up four light bulbs in a laboratory experiment. Today, more than half of all Texans rely on nuclear power as one of their sources of electricity. But the debate continues over how successful Texas' experiment with nuclear power has been. 
<P>
Texas now has 4,802 megawatts of installed nuclear power capacity coming from two plants: the 2,300-megawatt Comanche Peak project in Somervell County and the 2,502-megawatt South Texas Project in Matagorda County. The combined cost of constructing the two facilities was $15.6 billion.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#77">(77)</A> Part of the reason the plants were so expensive was that construction took many years longer than expected. The two units at Comanche Peak were under construction longer than any nuclear plant now operating in the U.S. Comanche Peak Unit Two got a construction permit in December of 1974, but did not begin operating until August of 1992.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#78">(78)</A> 
<P>
Concerns about safety and construction procedures have also hampered the South Texas Project in Matagorda County. The project got underway in 1975 and began generating power in 1988. It ran ten months before a fire caused the reactor to be shut down for six weeks.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#79">(79)</A> The plant was closed for most of 1993 after Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors discovered problems with maintenance, security and management at the plant. The facility came back on-line in February of 1994, only to shut down a few days later due to a faulty water pump. The plant is now re-opened but under close scrutiny by the NRC to prevent further problems. 
<P>
In 1992, the South Texas Project and Comanche Peak generated nearly 24.5 billion kilowatt hours of electricity, which accounted for more than 10 percent of all the electricity consumed in the state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#80">(80)</A> While the two plants are the only nuclear generating stations in Texas, many state residents consume electricity from nuclear plants located in other states. For instance, El Paso residents may get power from the Palo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona. Many East Texas residents use Louisiana's River Bend nuclear plant for electricity. In all, about 10 million Texans rely on utilities that produce nuclear power.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#81">(81)</A> 
<P>
Some anti-nuclear groups continue to advocate shutting down the nuclear plants immediately. They argue the move would save money for ratepayers over the long term because nuclear plants pose safety problems that could be very expensive to resolve. For instance, an accident like the one that occurred at the Chernobyl plant in the former Soviet Union could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. In addition, they say the long-term storage costs of radioactive waste are too expensive. 
<P>
However, nuclear power proponents point out that when operated correctly, nuclear plants emit little or no carbon dioxide. And they say that the plants will save ratepayers money over the long term because the fuel costs for nuclear power plants are far less than fuel costs for conventional fossil fuel plants. 
<P>
Disposing of radioactive waste from nuclear plants does present a difficult long-term problem. Texas used to send its low-level radioactive waste to a facility in Barnwell, South Carolina. However, that facility has reached its capacity. Low level radioactive waste is now stored above ground at each facility. The state of Texas plans to locate a low-level nuclear waste disposal site in Hudspeth County, but many local residents oppose the project. And even if the facility is approved, it will not open until the late 1990s.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#82">(82)</A> 
<P>
Under Texas law, low-level radioactive waste is defined as waste having a half life of 35 years. By law, all nuclear waste other than used fuel rods from power plants is classified as "low-level." These waste include items such as workers' discarded gloves and paper booties, as well as radioactive cooling water pipes and valves. These waste must be kept isolated for hundreds, if not thousands, of years in areas that are arid, geologically stable, and can be secured for centuries.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#83">(83)</A> Low-level storage facilities must monitor disposal sites for at least 350 years to assure that the waste returns to background levels of radioactivity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#84">(84)</A> 
<P>
A nuclear reactor produces about 30 tons of high-level and low-level radioactive material per year that must be stored safely.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#85">(85)</A> The most dangerous of these waste are spent fuel rods. The highly radioactive fuel rods are even more problematic than low-level waste. The U.S. Department of Energy has proposed a final storage site for the fuel rods at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. However, the site is still being investigated for its suitability and even if it is approved, it will not be ready to accept the spent fuel rods until 2010 at the earliest.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#86">(86)</A> 
<P>
Decommissioning, or shutting down the power plants, presents another long-term problem for the nuclear power industry. Shutting down Texas' nuclear plants will likely cost consumers several billion dollars. The exact cost of decommissioning the plants is unknown because none of the large generators has been decommissioned yet. However, state officials estimate that disposing of low-level waste from a decommissioned plant could cost up to $250 million.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#87">(87)</A> Labor costs and other costs could make the final cost several times that figure. Indeed, the few power plants that have been shut down have cost as much to decommission as they did to construct.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#88">(88)</A> 
<P>
No new nuclear power plants have been ordered in recent years. But new regulations under the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 could make it easier for utilities to build new nuclear generating stations.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#89">(89)</A> Before any new plants are built, however, the public will have to be convinced that viable waste disposal options are available for radioactive waste. In addition, citizens will have to be convinced that the plants are safe, cost competitive and that the mistakes of earlier projects will not be repeated. 
<H4>
<A NAME="URANIUM">Uranium</A>
</H4>
<P>
The nuclear power industry depends on uranium. For decades, Texas was a leading producer of this heavy, silvery-white element which can also be made into nuclear weapons. In the mid-1970s when the price of uranium was more than $40 per pound, nearly a dozen companies were operating some 35 uranium-mining sites in seven South Texas counties. Today, with the price at about $10 per pound, only a handful of companies continue to produce uranium in the state.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#90">(90)</A> 
<P>
Uranium used to be strip mined with technology similar to that used in coal mining. These uranium strip mine operations created large areas requiring remediation. Large tailings ponds have been created to contain the radioactive materials. These ponds, located in Karnes and Live Oak Counties, may pose a long-term threat to surface water and subsurface aquifers because they are subject to leakage. Federal law requires the tailings ponds, which contain materials that will remain radioactive for more than 1,600 years, to be covered, so that rainwater does not mix with the radioactive waste. However, these pond coverings may be eroded over time by water and wind, which could allow radium to escape into the atmosphere. The ponds must be monitored for centuries to assure that they are properly containing the radioactive waste. 
<P>
Today, most uranium mining is done with injection wells, which pump fluid through the geologic formations where the mineral is found. Production wells then bring the uranium-bearing solution to the surface. Called "solution mining" or "in-situ" mining, this method causes relatively little disturbance of the surface. However, this process can contaminate groundwater, which must then be disposed of by injection into deep formations below fresh water aquifers.

<A NAME="RENEWABLE">RENEWABLE ENERGY</A>
</H4>
<P>
With its fertile soil, sunny weather and strong winds, Texas holds great promise for renewable energy. Wind energy, solar power, biomass and hydropower could play large roles in the state's energy mix. However, at present, the state derives only about 0.4 percent of its total energy demand from renewable sources.
<H4>
<A NAME="WIND">Wind</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas residents have been harnessing the stiff Texas breeze for decades. Before electrification, rural residents relied on windchargers for electricity. Similar to windmills, these units turned wind energy into electric energy, which was used to charge batteries that powered electric lights and other devices. Rural residents also relied on windmills to pump water. Today, many windmills have been replaced by electric water pumps, but some 80,000 windmills continue to pump water for rural agricultural users in Texas.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#101">(101)</A>
<P>
Wind could provide Texas with vast amounts of electricity. Studies have shown that up to 136,000 megawatts of electricity - more than twice the state's total generating capacity - could be generated in Texas if all the state's wind resources could be captured.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#102">(102)</A> Unlike fossil fuel-fired power plants, wind-energy plants do not create carbon dioxide or other air pollutants. 
<P>
Wind farms in California have proven wind can be a reliable energy source. California now gets 1,600 megawatts of power from 17,000 wind turbines and the state is developing 1,500 megawatts of new wind power.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#103">(103)</A> Although California leads the world in wind-energy production, Texas has almost 20 times more wind-energy potential than California. <A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#104">(104)</A> 
<P>
Several utilities have taken note of Texas' wind-energy potential and numerous projects are underway in West Texas. Some 250 megawatts of wind-generated electricity will come on-line in 1995.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#105">(105)</A> While wind-energy shows great potential, several hurdles must be cleared before it will become a major energy source in the state. First, all of the planned wind units will be in the rural areas of West Texas, far from the urban and industrial areas where electric demand is highest. To capture all of these wind resources, new transmission lines will have to be built. No reliable estimates are available regarding the cost of building these new power lines. 
<P>
Second, wind farms can threaten wildlife. For reasons still not clear to biologists, the wind turbines have killed many birds of prey. But wind energy promoters say the bird mortality problem can be solved. 
<P>
The new class of wind turbines can generate power for as little as five cents per kilowatt hour, slightly more than the cost of coal-fired power plants. But when external costs, like air pollution are figured in, wind may be a cheaper power source than either fossil-fuel or nuclear plants.

<H4>
<A NAME="SOLAR">Solar</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas' solar energy potential far exceeds its wind energy potential. If the 262,000 square miles of Texas were covered with solar cells, the state would generate 550 quadrillion Btu's of electrical energy every year. That is equal to one and a half times the total energy used in the world.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#106">(106)</A> Obviously, the state won't ever be paved with solar cells, but Texas could easily incorporate solar power into the fuel mix. 
<P>
Texans already rely on photovoltaic cells to power highway lights, railroad switches, weather stations, outdoor lighting, gate openers and many other devices. Cheaper to install in remote areas than conventional power lines, photovoltaics are gaining popularity as evidenced by their increasingly common application in rural parts of the Third World. 
<P>
Some Texas utilities are looking at increased use of the solar cells as a low-cost, non-polluting source of power generation. For example, the city of Austin electric utility operates two photovoltaic stations that generate 450 kilowatts of electric power - enough to supply 50 to 100 homes. The Austin utility is the largest solar power producer in the state. 
<P>
As the price of producing photovoltaics continues to decline, solar cells could become a more common source of power. For example, utility companies in California have begun installing photovoltaic systems on residential rooftops. 
<P>
Solar water heaters could decrease demand for natural gas and electricity. In use for decades, solar water heaters are relatively inexpensive and can heat water for household use or provide space heating during winter months. To cut electricity usage, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District has financed the installation of solar water heaters on its customers' rooftops. Some 1,800 residents in the California town have now installed the units, which are providing hot water at a cost far lower than electrical heating units.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#107">(107)</A> 
<P>
Thermal solar power generators also offer great promise. Already installed in California, these systems use reflective mirrors to concentrate sunlight, which then heats oil or water to generate steam. That steam then drives a turbine which generates electricity. This technology is now being tested in West Texas.

<H4>
<A NAME="HYDRO">Hydro</A>
</H4>
<P>
The stored energy of water has been used by humans for centuries. Streams and rivers were dammed or re-routed to provide power for milling grain or cutting lumber. Today, dams are an important part of the Texas economy, providing water for irrigation and recreation as well as electricity for industrial and residential use. 
<P>
Dams in Texas provide 529 megawatts of electric generating capacity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#108">(108)</A> While that is only a fraction of the state's total electric needs, these hydropower facilities are non-polluting and provide reliable power. However, expanding the state's hydropower base may be difficult, as dams can adversely affect aquatic habitat and free-flowing streams. 
<H4>
<A NAME="BIOMASS">Biomass</A>
</H4>
<P>
Three communities in Texas - Center, Cleburne and Carthage - are using municipal solid waste to generate electricity. (However, this is not a perfect technology. See <I>Municipal Solid Waste </I>Chapter.) Half of the lumber companies and three-fourths of the paper companies in Texas burn wood waste to generate power.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#109">(109)</A> Texas generates huge amounts of plant and animal waste that could be utilized for thermal power generation. Every year, Texas produces some two quadrillion Btu's of energy in the form of agricultural waste, municipal waste and energy crops.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#110">(110)</A> If all that energy could be recovered, it would be enough to generate two-thirds of all the electricity used in Texas. State agencies are now examining how biomass might be used to generate electricity.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#111">(111)</A>
<P>
As a large grain-producing state, Texas may be able to use some of its farm production to make ethanol and methanol, which can be used as a motor fuel. They can also be combined with gasoline. Ethanol is an alcohol-based fuel made from fermenting grains and sugars. Methanol can be produced from municipal solid waste, crop residues, natural gas or coal. However these fuels have drawbacks. Methanol is highly toxic. Ethanol contains less heat energy than gasoline. Thus, vehicles running on ethanol get about 30 percent fewer miles per gallon than similar gasoline-powered vehicles. Both methanol and ethanol emit gases that are suspected carcinogens.<A HREF="NOTES7.HTML#112">(112)</A> These drawbacks could limit the use of these fuels. 
<P>
Increased use of biomass as an energy source has only recently gained attention. But this resource could play a larger role in Texas' renewable energy mix.

<A NAME="HABITAT">WILDLIFE AND HABITAT PROTECTION LEGISLATION IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Texas has a legislative history of species and habitat protection. According to author Robin Doughty, due to over-hunting, the decline of deer, turkey and fur-bearing animals in Texas was noticeable by the 1830s and 40s.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#10">(10)</A> A decline in certain bird species was also documented at this time. In response, the Texas Legislature enacted game laws. Game laws are still prevalent today and are used to prevent the demise, or in some cases, to control the proliferation of specific species.
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>In 1860, the first game law in Texas provided closed season for the hunting of quail on Galveston Island; this act did not attempt to provide for wildlife protection statewide but was aimed at protecting the quail of Galveston Island, which were being over-hunted.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#11">(11)</A>
	<P>
	<LI>In 1879, Governor Oran M. Roberts created the first state institution for the conservation of animals. The State Fish Commissioner was appointed to improve the conditions of freshwater fish species and marine organisms that were being heavily exploited as a food resource and also were being affected by water pollution.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#12">(12)</A> 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1903, under the Act to Preserve and Protect the Wild Game, Wild Birds and Wild Fowl, the state established a five-year closed season for the hunting of antelope, mountain sheep, and pheasants and ended commerce in wild animal meat, skins and plumage. 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1907, a law authorized the new Game, Fish and Oyster Commissioner to sell hunting licenses to finance enforcement of game laws. (In 1910, however, the Texas Legislature appropriated the fund for other purposes and little enforcement took place.)
	<P>
	<LI>In 1925, a state law was passed to establish game preserves on privately held land.
	<P>
	<LI>In l973, The Texas Legislature enacted a state Endangered Species Act, which was amended in l981, 1985 and l987. The Act gave the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) the authority to establish a list of fish, wildlife and plants endangered or threatened with statewide extinction. Once listed, these species are afforded protection and are eligible for restoration efforts. 
	<P>
	<LI>In 1983, The Texas Legislature established a Special Non-game and Endangered Species Fund to support non-game and endangered species research and management. The Fund receives money from fines, the sale of posters, stamps, and decals and from private donations. Also, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shares a portion of the money it receives from the federal excise tax on hunting equipment with the states to support non-game and endangered species research and management.
	<P>
	<LI>In 1991, the 72nd Legislature adopted a bill adding wildlife management to the list of "agricultural uses" which qualified otherwise taxable open land for special appraisal valuation for property tax purposes. Though the Attorney General must still address some unanswered questions regarding the interpretation of this bill, essentially farmers who take land out of production and return it to a natural state for the purpose of wildlife management may be taxed according to the land's productivity value rather than its market value. In other words, the land retains its "agricultural use" property-tax status. 
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> In the state Endangered Species Act, there is no state criterion for protecting wildlife species from indirect take (e.g., destruction of habitat or unfavorable management practices). The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department does have a Memorandum of Understanding with every state agency to conduct a thorough environmental review of state initiated and funded projects, such as highways, reservoirs, land acquisition and building construction, to determine the potential impact on state endangered or threatened species.

<A NAME="PUBLIC">PUBLIC OPINION: WHO IS LISTENING?</A>
</H4>
<P>
Surveys conducted separately by Texas A&amp;M University and Rice University reflect Texans' strong concern for wildlife. A 1989 Texas A&amp;M survey revealed that 93 percent of Texans believe that endangered species should be protected.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#13">(13)</A> A Rice University poll conducted in December 1994 showed that 56 percent of those surveyed were willing to spend more tax monies to set aside and protect wilderness areas for endangered species in Texas; 37 percent were against spending more tax monies. Sixty-one percent of those surveyed agreed that "when humans change the natural environment, by building dams or clearing forests, it often can have disasterous results." Moreover, 64 percent of those interviewed agreed with the following view: "Some restrictions on property rights are justified to protect important aspects of the environment, such as wetlands or endangered species."<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#14">(14)</A>
<P>
A nationwide poll conducted in May 1994 found Americans surveyed supported setting aside more land for conservation and making landowners abide by rules to protect plants and animals. The poll indicated that 66 percent of those interviewed stated that they were more concerned with the environment than they had been a few years ago. Some 65 percent of those interviewed said more land should be set aside for conservation purposes.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#15">(15)</A>

<A NAME="FISH">FISH AND WILDLIFE CONDITIONS IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Known for its ecological diversity, Texas is the home of 5,500 plant species, 425 of which only occur in Texas. Of 1,100 vertebrate species in Texas, 60 are found nowhere else in the world. With 540 bird species, Texas has more than any other state in the U.S.
<P>
As of December 1, 1993, the federal government listed 629 U.S. plant and animal species as endangered and 189 as threatened. Four hundred and ninety-five foreign only (not found in the United States) plant and animals species are endangered and 38 foreign only plant and animal species are threatened. In the future, it is expected that 3,000 species may need to be listed as endangered and threatened.

<P>
Extinction of animal species in Texas has increased dramatically since the turn of the century. Prior to 1900, three species were known to have disappeared. Between 1901-1958 four species are known to have disappeared. From 1959 to the present, ten species have disappeared. Of these 17 species, six are globally extinct. 
<P>
The extinction rate in Texas of plant species is difficult to ascertain. The survival of plant species has become a public concern only recently, and inventories are limited.
<P>
Texas has the third highest number of listed endangered and threatened species of any state. Florida and Hawaii are number one and number two. Besides those species currently listed as endangered and threatened, there is evidence to indicate that another 305 species in Texas are candidates for the endangered and threatened lists.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#18">(18)</A> 
<P>
According to the American Fisheries Society's endangered species committee, Texas is one of the most hazardous places in the United States for a fish species. The state has lost six species of fish - four since 1980.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#19">(19)</A>  In 1994, 29 fish species are listed as endangered or threatened. 
<P>
Interestingly, concern for the decline in freshwater fish species in the mid 1800s in Texas spurred the state's first conservation institution - the Fish Commissioner. Because the Fish Commissioner had limited resources and authority, however, the office did little to improve conditions for fish species. Instead, the Fish Commissioner attempted to compensate for the decline in native species by introducing European carp to Texas.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#20">(20)</A>

<P>
The Federal Endangered Species Act requires states to design a recovery program for each listed species. In Texas, the legislature delegated this responsibility to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The American alligator is the only endangered species on the Texas list that has ever been removed from the endangered list because of successful recovery activities.
<P>
Some of the methods used in recovery programs include research on the reproductive habits and ecology of rare species, examination of the taxonomic relationship of rare species to their environment and each other to determine appropriate survival and management strategies, assistance to landowners to improve wildlife habitat, and the purchase, where funds are available, of wildlife habitats. Texas Parks and Wildlife receives enough money to study only one in 10 endangered species.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#22">(22)</A> 
<P>
Though scientists understand the importance of habitat to the life of a species, they are just beginning to determine what constitutes livable space for a species. Biologists do know, however, that the loss of one species in an ecosystem can sometimes threaten the balance of the entire ecosystem and may cause its demise. For instance, Texas Parks and Wildlife speculates that the extirpation of the Black-footed Ferret may have contributed to problems managing prairie dog populations.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#23">(23)</A>

<p>

According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the majority of calls reporting pollution and fish kills originate in areas of high urban and industrial development. This is due both to the increased pressure on the environment in these areas as well as the larger number of people who observe and report problems. The upper Texas coastal area (Houston-Port Arthur/Beaumont) normally has the highest number of incidents for each year. Other regions that have a significant number of reports are the regions that include Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, the Corpus Christi area and the Lower Rio Grande Valley.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#24">(24)</A>

LOSS OF FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT
</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>
<B>Springs and Spring Runs
</B></TD></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: Due to their unique characteristics (constant temperature, clear water and in some cases isolation from connecting watercourses), these habitats are natural settings for many rare and unusual species. Status: A significant number of Texas springs have gone dry from man's activities. Over pumping of groundwater for irrigation and human use has led to lowering of groundwater tables and decreased or ceased spring discharge (the Edward's Aquifer is one example). Texas historically had 281 major springs. By 1973 only 2 of 4 very large and 17 
of 31 large springs were still flowing. Future: Increasing pressures on groundwater and aquifers will continue to impact existing springs, affecting associated flora and fauna.
</TD></TR><TR><Td>
<B>Bottomland Hardwoods
</B></Td></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: Texas' most diverse terrestrial habitat. An estimated 16 million acres of riparian (river/stream associated) habitat existed in early Texas. Status: More than 60 percent has been lost to agricultural conversion, timber production, urban/industrial development and reservoir construction. Future: Additional water development, new technologies in the use of hardwood pulp, and forestry practices threaten this habitat, especially in East Texas.
</TD></TR><TR><Td>
<B>Coastal Wetlands</B>
</Td></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: The most important estuarine habitat since 90 percent of commercially and recreationally important species depend on these wetlands. One-third of all endangered species occur here and millions of waterfowl overwinter in this habitat. Status: Some 53 percent of all USA wetlands have been lost to dredge and fill for development, subsidence and agricultural conversion. Texas has lost more than 50 percent of its original 1.2 million acres. Thirty-five percent of losses have occurred since 1950. Almost half of Texas estuarine areas are closed, or conditionally closed, to shellfish harvest because of pollution. Future: Coastal development, loss of freshwater inflows and sea level rise threaten remaining wetlands.
</TD></TR><TR><Td>
<B>South Texas Brushlands
</B></Td></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: A unique habitat where more than 500 vertebrate species and more than 260 species of woody plants occur. Numerous endangered species including the ocelot and jaguarundi are found here. Status: Since the 1920s, more than 95 percent of the original brushlands have been converted to agricultural and urban use. Future: Restoration of brush and acquisition of remaining habitat is key to maintaining this unique ecosystem.
</TD></TR><TR><Td>
<B>Texas Prairie
</B></Td></TR><TR><TD>
Habitat: More than 20 million acres of tallgrass communities once covered the Texas Blacklands Prairie, the Fort Worth Prairie, the Feyette Prairie and the Coastal Prairie. Status: Of the 12.6 million acres of the Blacklands Prairie, fewer than 100,000 acres (less than 10 percent) of native sod exist today. A million acres of Coastal Prairie have been urbanized by Houston. Endangered species such as the Attwater's prairie chicken are on the edge of extinction because of such losses. Future: Continued losses to this habitat is expected. Restoration, cooperative actions and private landowners will be key to saving these prairie habitats.

<H4>
<A NAME="LOSS">THE LOSS OF WILDLIFE HABITAT 
</A></H4>
<P>
Today the overwhelming majority of losses of and threats to wildlife, plants and natural communities are a direct result of habitat alteration or destruction, caused by urbanization, timber production, reservoirs and agriculture.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#25">(25)</A> According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the following are examples of habitat loss in Texas: 
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>All but a fraction of the prairies of central and coastal Texas have been converted to farmland, and as a result the Attwater's Prairie Chicken is on the brink of extinction and Texas Prairie Dawn, a plant of the coastal prairies, is now rare.
	<P>
	<LI>River bottom hardwood forests in Texas have been reduced from 16 to six million acres and longleaf pine forests have nearly all been cut-over. As a result of these changes, Texas Trailing Phlox and many other plants are rare, the Ivory-billed Woodpecker is gone from Texas, and the Red-cockaded Woodpecker is threatened with the same fate.
	<P>
	<LI>The original grasslands of South Texas have been lost to brush invasion, the grassland-dependent Aplomado Falcon disappeared from Texas, the Slender Rush-Pea is endangered, and the South Texas Ambrosia has become rare.
	<P>
	<LI>Sub-tropical woodlands of the Rio Grande Valley have been converted to farmlands and citrus plantations, resulting in near-extinction of the Ocelot in Texas and increasing rarity for many plants, such as the Texas Ayenia.
	<P>
	<LI>Ground water pumping in West Texas and dam construction throughout the state have modified springs and rivers so that species such as the Amistad Gambusia and Phantom Shiner are extinct, and many other species, such as the Puzzle Sunflower, are rare.
	<P>
	<LI>* Urbanization and land clearing in the Texas hill country have destroyed and fragmented woodland habitat of the endangered Golden-cheeked Warbler, along with several rare plants.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#26">(26)</A> 
</UL>
<P>
Another indication of ecological change is the documentation that marine and brackish fishes have invaded the lower Rio Grande basin as a result of high salinity, which in turn is forcing out freshwater fish.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#27">(27)</A> 
<P>
Texas has 133 million acres of wildlife habitat remaining. This includes springs, bottomland hardwoods, coastal wetlands, south Texas brush lands, and Texas prairies. Ninety-seven percent of the land in Texas is privately held. Therefore, the continued existence of wildlife habitat is very much in the hands of the private sector. 
<P>
Wildlife habitat in Texas is broken into eight categories:<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#28">(28)</A> 
<P>
<OL>
	<LI><B>Grasses</B>, 32 percent - herbs, grasses, forbs and grasslike plants are dominant
	<P>
	<LI><B>Brush</B>, 20 percent - woody plants, most less than nine feet tall, are dominant
	<P>
	<LI><B>Shrub</B>, 15 percent - individual wood plants generally less than nine feet tall and widely scattered throughout arid region
	<P>
	<LI><B>Parks</B>, 13 percent - home to woody plants mostly equal to or greater than nine feet tall, dominant and growing as clusters 
	<P>
	<LI><B>Forest</B>, 13 percent - deciduous or evergreen trees dominant; most taller than 30 feet with closed crowns
	<P>
	<LI><B>Woods</B>, 6 percent - woody plants mostly nine to 30 feet tall with closed crowns; midstory usually lacking
	<P>
	<LI><B>Swamps</B>, less than 1 percent - deciduous or evergreen trees with varying heights within inundated or almost inundated sites
	<P>
	<LI><B>Marsh</B>, less than 1 percent - emergent herbaceous plants dominant in inundated areas, woody vegetation lacking or nearly so.

To encourage people to make environmentally-sound choices about where to live and do business in the Austin area, the Hill Country Foundation has developed a color map which includes text and graphics illustrating geologic and natural history of Travis County and parts of Williamson and Hays Counties. The map includes information on endangered species habitat areas, watersheds, aquifer recharge zones, 100-year flood plains, school district boundaries and location of major employers. The Hill Country Foundation has produced a creative tool to help citizens and businesses manage urban growth in environmentally sensitive areas. The map is being made available to the real estate and business communities to be used as a corporate relocation tool. Maybe other communities will join in this approach. <P>Contact: Hill Country Foundation, 1800 Guadalupe, Austin, Texas 78701.

<A NAME="MANAGE">WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREAS IN TEXAS
</A></H4>
<P>
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department owns and/or leases approximately 700,000 acres for wildlife management areas. 
<P>
The funds used for acquisition and operation of state wildlife management areas is derived from an excise tax on hunting equipment and from hunting stamps. No general revenue is used.
<P>
In Texas, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages 18 national wildlife refuges, totaling 417,000 acres. 
<H4>

<A NAME="WETLANDS">WETLANDS: CRITICAL HABITATS
</A></H4>
<P>
Wetlands ecosystems are second only to the rain forests in the number of wildlife and plant species that depend on them for feeding and habitat. 
<P>
Wetlands are defined "as areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions."<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#29">(29)</A> Wetlands include marshes, swamps, bogs, and shallow lakes and can include floodplains and mudflats.
<P>
Among their many valuable functions, which include filtering pollutants and preventing erosion and flooding, wetlands are the breeding, feeding and nesting grounds for many endangered species and plants and for non-endangered wildlife and natural communities. 
<P>
In recognizing the tremendous importance of wetlands, the federal government established a national goal of "no overall net loss of wetlands." The Clean Water Act of 1972 is the law that has had the greatest impact upon wetlands. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers for any dredging or filling into waters of the United States. This includes both terrestrial and coastal wetlands. 
<P>
In Texas in 1993, of the 1,510 Section 404 permits issued for dredging and filling wetlands, 733 were found in coastal areas. Only 20 to 30 inland permits are issued a year and those are usually for reservoirs that significantly affect wetlands.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#30">(30)</A> This does not indicate that inland wetlands are less threatened by human activities, however. The 404 permit process is discussed in the <I><A HREF="../QualityCh2p1.html">Water Quality</A></I> chapter.

<A NAME="PROTECT">PROTECTING WETLANDS IN TEXAS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Though Texas has lost one-half of its coastal wetlands and 60 percent of its terrestrial wetlands in the last 200 years, there is no state law to protect wetlands. In the coastal management legislation of 1991, Texas legislators did incorporate a no-net-loss of wetlands <I>policy </I>for <I>state-owned </I>land. Though this is a positive step, the majority of wetlands are on private lands. 
<P>
Three state agencies have significant roles in wetland protection: the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and the Texas General Land Office. Among federal agencies, the Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have significant responsibility for wetland protection. 
<P>
There are two major types of wetlands in Texas: inland/terrestrial wetlands and Coastal wetlands. Inland wetlands include bottomland hardwood forests in East Texas and riparian vegetation and playa lakes (shallow lakes) in West Texas. A discussion of coastal wetlands, including salt and freshwater marshes, is found in the section on water resources. 
<P>
Interior wetlands account for 80 percent of the total wetland acreage in Texas. Texas has lost 60 percent of its most valuable inland wetlands: the riparian communities.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#31">(31)</A> Most of the inland wetlands are on privately held properties. 
<P>
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has been assigned as the lead agency to develop a state wetlands conservation plan. Though the plan will be statewide in scope, it will focus on inland wetlands, since the Texas General Land Office is developing a coastal wetlands plan. According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, conserving wetlands will depend on acquisition, cooperative agreements, education and technical assistance.

<A NAME="BOTTOM">BOTTOMLAND FORESTED WETLANDS</A>
</H4>
<P>
Bottomland hardwood systems are the most diverse Texas ecosystems. Bottomland wetlands are plant communities that have been created as a result of the actions of creeks, rivers and flood plains. The bottomland hardwood forest is a part of a system that starts at a river's headwaters and ends in an estuary at the ocean. Trees found in the bottom-land hardwood forests include bald cypress, pecan, oaks, elm, cottonwood and hackberry. These hardwoods, particularly old-growth hardwoods (50 to 100 years old), contribute to the biodiversity of the wetland system. They also provide food and shelter for wildlife.
<P>
At least 189 species of trees and shrubs, 42 woody vines, 75 grasses and 802 herbaceous plants occur in Texas bottomlands. Bottomland systems also support 116 species of fish, 31 species of amphibians, 54 species of reptiles, 273 species of birds and 45 species of mammals.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#32">(32)</A> Seventy-four species of threatened and endangered animals depend directly on bottomland hardwood systems. Over 50 percent of all the neotropical songbirds that are not listed as endangered or threatened are associated with bottomland hardwood forests. Thirty-one water species (mallards and wood ducks), eastern wild turkey, swamp rabbit, gray squirrel and 11 species of furbearers depend on bottomland hardwoods.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#33">(33)</A> 
<P>
These bottomland systems also play a vital role in maintaining water quality. By serving as a depository for sediments, wastes and pollutants from runoff, these bottomland forests enhance the water quality of bays and estuaries which lie at the lower end of these riparian corridors. Some pollutants are transformed into less harmful substances by microbiological agents in the floodplain.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#34">(34)</A> Bottomlands also play a critical role in containing floodwaters when rivers overflow. 
<P>
<UL>
	<IMG SRC="../FYI.GIF"> Forested wetland systems support fish and wildlife populations that are an integral part of the state's $4.2 billion hunting and fishing industry.
</UL>
<P>
In the 18th century, Texas had approximately 16 million acres of hardwood bottomland riparian corridors. Today, the state has 5.9 million acres of bottomland hardwoods -  a 63 percent loss of bottomland hardwood. This acreage currently comprises 3 percent of the total land area of the state.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#35">(35)</A> The majority of bottomland hardwood acres are found in East Texas; only about one million acres are scattered through the western portion of the state.
<P>
Both the Texas Forest Service and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department recognize that there has been a steady decline in bottomland hardwood forests since the early 19th century.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#36">(36)</A> Texas Parks and Wildlife shows that losses of bottomland hardwoods are continuing in Texas at the rate of about 12 percent per decade.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#37">(37)</A> Reservoirs, development and agriculture threaten bottomland hardwood. But hardwood pulp (ground-up wood fiber) consumption is responsible for the recent upward trend in exploitation of bottomland ecosystems in Texas. Pulpwood consumption in the U.S. is expected to more than double from 82 million tons in l986 to 173 million tons by 2040, and pulpwood demand worldwide has further stimulated increased consumption of hardwoods. This demand is fueled by the demand for high quality computer paper, white cardboard shipping cartons and other paper products, such as six-pack soda carriers, which require a higher hardwood fiber component.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#38">(38)</A> In the U.S., Texas ranks seventh in pulpwood consumption by manufacturing industries.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#39">(39)</A>

Since Mitsubishi set up its company in 1992, the price of a cord of hardwood in East Texas has risen from $4.00 to $11.00. Source: Texas Forest Service.

<H4><A NAME="PLAYA">PLAYA LAKES</A></H4>
<P>
Texas playa lakes - shallow, circular basins - are the wintering wetland habitat for millions of waterfowl that migrate from as far north as Canada. There are 20,000 playa lakes located in 37 counties of the Texas Panhandle and South Plains. The total area of playa basins has been estimated at 296,000 acres. Fifteen million birds annually migrate through these playas in the fall and spring on their way to and from wintering habitat on the Gulf Coast and farther south.<A HREF="NOTES4.HTML#40">(40)</A> Ducks, geese and sandhill cranes also use these playas as winter havens. The majority of these oases of wildlife habitat are located within intensively cultivated, privately held farmland. Precipitation and irrigation runoff contribute to the development of these wetlands. Land use practices and changes in irrigation methods intended to limit runoff are reducing the capacity of playas to provide food and water for waterfowl.

<FONT SIZE=+1>The Centre for Renewal in Public Policy is an independent, non-profit,
charitable organization dedicated to addressing important, but often
over-looked, questions relevant to public policy formulation in Canada.  The Centre is committed 
to producing first class publications and hosting educational events that raise key questions
in a way that will be helpful for scholars, professionals, politicians, bureaucrats and citizens 
from all walks of life.  The Centre for Renewal in Public Policy is made up of leaders who, while they represent a
broad variety of political and religious affiliations, all share a belief in the importance of the Jewish and Christian traditions as living traditions.</FONT><BR><BR>

<H2>BOOK REVIEW</H2>

<H4>Emberley, P.C. and Newell, W.R. (1994): Bankrupt Education: The Decline of
Liberal Education in Canada.</H4>

<P><I>-Reviewed by Roxanne McDiarmid, Ed. D.</I></P>

<P>A clarion call to Canadian consciousness is being sounded by Peter C.
Emberley and Waller R. Newell in their book Bankrupt Education: The Decline
of Liberal Education in Canada.  They register deep concern for fact that
in direct opposition to the inspirational guidelines and organizational
structures for liberal education in Canadian schools and universities,
constituted by Canada's founding politicians and educators, a massive
restructuring initiative to disrupt those footings is currently being
foisted upon a largely unsuspecting Canadian public.</P>

<P>Premised on an ideology of victimization, unanswerable allegations of
systemic racism and classism, allow the reformers a virtual open court in
which to hurl their process of endless alterations and renovations.  The
authors describe how in Ontario, in 1992 for example, the Ministry of
Education issued directives to school boards to develop and put in place
Ministry approved anti-racism and ethno-cultural equity policies in short
order.  Immediately behind this posturing followed two new policy documents
which appear intended to divest Ontario schools of every last remnant of
the liberal education for which many senior citizens now yearn.</P>

<P>The initiatives focused on The Transition Years: Grades 7,8, and 9, and
were marked by the features of de-streaming of students, learning outcomes
with their accompanying benchmark assessment procedures, and The Common
Curriculum.  The Core programme content of The Common Curriculum was
organized into four integrated subject modules: namely, Language; Arts;
Self and Society; and Mathematics, Science and Technology; all of which was
intended to promote self-actualization, rather than fine character and
citizenship as liberal education had offered in the past.</P>

<P>Based  upon assumptions of enlightened entitlement, and propelled by
convictions of logical self-certainty, resourcefulness, creativity and
adaptability, today's student, Emberley and Newell explain, is expected to
be a self-directed learner at the centre of his or her universe.  The "new"
students are to use their 'innate' set of linguistic and thinking skills to
problem-solve their way through the 'holism' of this system, which they are
to believe is their real world (pp. 44-45).  The authors contend however,
that The Common Curriculum is not a balanced curriculum because it does not
harmonize identity with difference as did that which characterized the soul
of a liberally educated person.  Nor does The Common Curriculum succeed,
they claim, in trying to conjoin universal skill with self-empowerment and
ethno-cultural identities, because here it simply bypasses the institutions
normally understood to mediate between the real world and the individual.
The actual result, the authors suggest, reflects a bland homogeneity
distinguished only by mediocrity.</P>

<P>Emberley and Newell advise that by gnostic insistence on the superiority
of their 'new' ideas over all traditional practice, today's social
reformers are merely the 1990s version of progressive activists with
similar agendas from earlier decades.  For example: 'values education' in
the 1960s, 'enriched courses' in the 1970s, and 'back-to-basics' in the
1980s.  Emberley discusses this rationale in depth in his recent book,
Values Education and Technology: The Ideology of Dispossession.<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></P>

<P>Over the past thirty years, Emberley and Newell tell us, 'child-centred
and process-orientated' concepts of teaching and learning have been putting
students in Canada at an ever-increasing disadvantage when they enter
university, by having failed to equip learners with the basic skills of
reading, writing and analytical self-distance.  In addition, by publicizing
censorious views of university management, teaching and research practices,
the reconstructionists attempt to erode the public's confidence in the
aspiration to impartiality, the very purpose for which the university was
founded.  True independent-mindedness is the highest ideal of
liberal education the authors remind us, and thus indispensable to a
university's identity (p. 67).</P>

<P>Lying at the root of the reformers' relentless negation of education for
reality, is their general fear and abandonment of standards of merit.
Emberley and Newell  believe that rewarding and encouraging merit in
individuals contributes naturally to the development of a just,
hierarchical society.  It promotes a genuine intellectual diversity that
prepares dutiful citizens and leaders for the community.  Germane to the
constitution of the Canadian confederation was our unique history in the
accommodation of the duties and rights of individuals, to be ensured by an
education toward those goals.</P>

<P>Bankrupt Education provides the readers with an encapsulated odyssey of
liberal education's history and heroes of the Western tradition.  A glimpse
is given of that wider window into the world, which was modified over
centuries to remain vital in its goal to seek a truly judicious balance in
the learner, between the human longing for wholeness and its relation to
the principles of a just and satisfying political order.  By the reading of
great books, the liberal student learned first through Plato's Socratic
soul-craft, the arts of physical fitness and dialectical speech, and then
from Aristotle's civic paideia  the need for citizens to understand
themselves in the immediacy of their everyday communal lives.  The study of
gymnastics, mathematics, poetry, art and drama, originated this curriculum.
Later, the study of works by poets like Dante and Shakespeare expanded the
student's horizons while maintaining local patriotism, the classical virtue
of which would be further enriched by Biblical studies and Augustine's
distinctive Christian teaching of humility in God's Love.  The traditional
teacher-student relationship of instruction and debate promised to ensure
the continuance of this heritage.</P>

<P>Characterized by the questioning of tradition and practice, liberal
learning increasingly disquieted established orders of knowledge in Europe
from the Middle Ages, as it continually sought to reconcile immediacy with
transcendence.  Gradually, the previously integrated human soul became
wrenched apart with the advancement of the modern self-evident logic
developed in Cartesian mathematical thinking. The idyllic idealism of
Enlight-enment philosophies allowed the erotic longings of the heart to
escape into a world of Rousseauean dreams while they longed to be free of
the severity of the analytical mind.  In today's schooling, where
infatuation with information from these disparate perceptions reigns
supreme, therapeutic group encounters of self-disclosure now masquerade as
teaching and learning classrooms.</P>

<P>Most important for Canadian students, the authors advise, is that they
learn through a broad reading of historical and philosophical works, that
the first principles of revolutionary optimism for individual freedom
emanated from the opposing extremes of formalism and romanticism, and
animated the founders of the United States.  By contrast, Canada's
constitution was established on principles informed by precedent and
tradition.  It issues from a cardinal concern for the common good,
requiring renewal by an education in appreciation of organic ties.  United
in their dedication to oppose scientism, utilitarianism, empiricism and
pragmatism, the architects of Canadian education insisted that the common
sense endowed to human beings would be improved through the learning of
virtue, so that moral principle and public duty must take precedence over
individual rights and autonomy.</P>

<P>Consequently, if Canada is to survive the increasing universalization and
atomization which are presently putting the  nation-state at peril on a
global scale, Emberley and Newell advise that we must restore Canadian
liberal education.  The best promise for sustaining the distinctive
Canadian capacity to harmonize cultural difference with genuine human
longing for a higher Unity rests with a very different education curriculum
than the one currently offered.<BR></P>

"de-moralization" of society, in both senses of the term. We are

'de-moralized' because we are no longer able to think of our lives (much

less live them) in moral terms. And we are demoralized - that is, defeated,

discouraged, dismayed - by the effects of the revolutionary,

counter-cultural ideas that enchanted us only thirty years ago.</P>



<P>Despite the expectation raised by her sub-title, "From Victorian Virtues

to Modern Values", Himmelfarb does not exactly offer a history of the last

hundred years of moral reflection. Instead, all seven chapters are devoted

to vignettes, stories and historical narrative concerning Victorian

Britain, with occasional sidelong glances at the U.S.A. in the same period.

Victorian attitudes to the poor, to Jews and to women are all canvassed,

but mainly Himmelfarb is interested by what we would call their 'family

values'. What she calls 'modern values', and the de-moralized society that

goes with them, are discussed only in the prologue, epilogue and postscript

of the book.</P>



<P>It is surprising that so uneven an allotment of pages turns out so well,

but two things work in the author's favour. First, she is aided by her

obvious mastery of the Victorian period, which enables her to pick the most

telling examples and apposite illustrations of her main contentions. Next,

the portrait of Victorian times is not painted for its own sake, but rather

in the way that the deeds of a    virtuous older sister might be praised in

the hearing of a wayward child. Thus the focus of the book turns out to be

contemporary North America after all, even when it is most concerned with

Victorian Britain.</P>



<P>No comment is necessary, for example, when prominent Victorians refer to

the Queen as "the head of  morality" or praise the Royal Family's "salutary

influence" on the nation's morals. Likewise, our feminist 'herstorians',

prepared to reject the entire past as a time of unrelieved oppression, will

no doubt appreciate the unspoken message tucked away in a footnote:

"Throughout the nineteenth century more novels were published by women

(under their own names) than by men."</P>



<P>And so it goes throughout the book. The picture of Victorians as

materialistic, hypocritical, overly acquisitive, and sexually repressed

gives way to a more balanced account of more believable people. They turn

out to be men and women to whom giving is as important as gaining, who

sought (and often found) sexual satisfaction in marriage, and whose

hypocrisy is more in the eye of the twentieth century beholder (comparing

their deeds with our thoughts) than in any documentable weakness of their

own. Himmelfarb shows us people for whom admiration would be more fitting

than scorn.</P>



<P>Those who find this approach to Kulturkritik too subtle may wish to turn

immediately to the epilogue, where the knockout blows are quickly struck.

The illegitimacy rate in London's poorest quarter was under 3% in 1900

and had not risen above 5% by 1960. By 1992 it had reached 32%. Similar

figures apply in the United States, except that for blacks they must be

roughly doubled. Homicide and violent crime have followed a similar upward

path, as have drug addiction and alcoholism, especially among the young.</P>



<P>Take a walk through the older part of your town and compare those grand

Victorian houses with the cheap vaults in which middle class people store

themselves today. That will put you in the proper frame of mind for reading

Himmelfarb's book, something everyone who can exercise moral influence upon

our sick society should be sure to do.<BR></P>

<A NAME=Noll><H4>Mark A. Noll: The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans,

1994). 279 pp, $28.00 (Can.)</H4>



<P><I>-Reviewed by Professor Graeme Hunter</I></P>



<P>"The search for a Christian mind is not, in the end, a search for mind, but

a search for God." On this surprising note Mark Noll ends his timely

exhortation to Evangelicals to think. It is surprising because Noll seems

to have been telling us with exemplary clarity up to that point that

evangelicals have a different problem: They have already and indisputably

found God; their problem is that they have found Him without engaging their

minds. The real message of Noll's book therefore seems to be twofold:

First, evangelicals can no longer afford to do without their minds. Second,

some of them, like Noll himself, are beginning to realize that.</P>



<P>Mark Noll is the McManis Professor of Christian Thought at Wheaton

College, and so has a vested interest in multiplying thinking evangelicals.

That he also has the capacity to do so is demonstrated by this learned,

lucid book. The manifold intellectual failings and few successes of recent

evangelicalism, documented here with both passion and attention to detail,

make a sad story, but not a hopeless one. Noll describes his book as "an

epistle from a wounded lover". He convincingly argues that it is in the

interest of the whole Church to see a Christian mind develop in the

spiritually dynamic, numerically strong,     but intellectually sluggish

giant of evangelicalism.</P>



<P>When Charles Malik opened the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College in

1980, he asked his audience a couple of provocative questions. "Who among

the evangelicals can stand up to the great secular or naturalistic or

atheistic scholars on their own terms of scholarship or research? Who among

the evangelical scholars is quoted as a normative source by the greatest

secular authorities on history or philosophy or psychology or sociology or

politics?" Any informed reader will easily supply Malik's implied answer.</P>



<P>The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind documents the scandalous fact that

there is almost no evangelical mind. The Christians most in need of

intellectual awakening continue in the soundest sleep. Yet the book itself

is evidence that their torpor may be ending. Noll is an evangelical writer

who knows his craft as well as his subject and he gives a reasoned,

compelling account of the history and current state of the evangelical

constituency within North American Protestantism.</P>



<P>The mental complacency of today's evangelicals apparently derives from the

intellectual successes of their ancestors. In the middle of the last

century Protestant thinkers found themselves broadly in sympathy with the

major intellectual currents of their day. They were empiricists in science,

common-sensical in philosophy, intuitivists in morality, and biblicists in

dogma. In social matters they were pragmatic and activist, viewing the

world with the expansive confidence which we now see as typical of their

age.</P>



<P>It didn't last, however.  When the dominant scientific paradigms changed,

many Protestant intellectuals either couldn't or wouldn't change with them.

Increasingly, therefore, they found themselves at odds with the scientific

community and threatened by it. Pragmatic and activist social policy was

unaffected, while the thought that had once guided it was transformed into

dogma. Gradually, a noticeably anti-intellectual constituency began to form

within the Protestant churches.</P>



<P>Politically, for example, contemporary evangelicals are not known for any

penetrating analysis of political life, but for their activism,

particularly concerning abortion. (That they are active in a just and good

cause is true, but not germane to the question of their intellectual

achievements.) In science they are associated not with mainstream

discoveries or novel technological applications, but with the creationist

alternative to mainstream science. In different ways and to different

degrees both their politics and their science make valuable contributions

to contemporary Christian life. Noll's point is only that they are not

intellectual contributions. He grants, of course, that the intellect is not

the only faculty or even the most important one. But it exists. And our

Lord called upon us to use it in his service. Evangelicals therefore will

neglect to do so at their peril.</P>



<P>Of course, the moral of the tale applies widely, and Noll's study will

therefore be read with interest and   profit by members of all

denominations. No part of the Church can expect to exert much influence on

an impatient, pluralistic America, if its only resources are its own

intuitions, however well-justified, and common sensical these may be. There

is no way to dispense with the currencies of culture and science.  The only

way to use them effectively is for Christians to buy them, melt them down,

and then mint them afresh, stamped with the image of Christ. This

invigorating call to intellectual action from an awakened evangelical may

be the leaven needed for the whole lump.</P>



<P>Less convincing is Noll's contention that the so-called

"anti-foundationalist" and anti-realist thinking, which he detects and

encourages in some recent evangelical thought, will bring the evangelical

mind far along the road to recovery. The common-sense heritage of

evangelicals might link more easily and profitably with the resurgent

scientific and moral realism of recent years. In any case, Noll's excellent

book is likely to influence the development of the evangelical mind for

years to come and deserves the widest discussion.<BR></P>

<H2>Tradition  or traditionalism?</H2>

<P><I>Iain T. Benson<BR>
Senior Research Fellow, Centre for Renewal in Public Policy</I></P>

<P>The term "traditional" has, for many people, become a term of criticism or even
derision.  For others, it is a banner to march under; as in "traditional
family values".  In a book that Northrop Frye said was sure to become a
classic,<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> historian Jaroslav Pelikan makes several important observations
that are relevant to our understanding and use of the term "tradition".</P>

<P>First, that we ought to make a distinction between tradition and
traditionalism.  Traditionalism is "the dead faith of the living" and it is
traditionalism that gives tradition a bad name.  Joan O'Donovan has
described the essence of traditionalism as:  ...the allegiance to
long-accepted social forms and proprieties without an articulate conception
of the moral and spiritual ends they serve.  It is the disproportionate
love of the authority of human law as distinct from its content, entailing
an exaggerated estimation of the accomplishment of the law as such.<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A></P>

<P>The issue here is far larger than a difficulty in articulating the
tradition because, in time, people will give up in practical existence
those aspects they no longer have any intellectual conviction about.  The
law, being itself subject to continual challenge, interpretation and
development, will develop in ways that are consistent with the spirit and
direction of earlier periods or against such a spirit.  The issue is
whether the changes are within the right spirit of the tradition or
not and traditionalism cannot inform us of that.  Only tradition, since it
knows its own spirit, can develop in time without becoming ossified and
untrue to itself.  Only an understanding of the moral and spiritual ends of
a tradition keep its spirit alive and preserve it from becoming
traditionalism.   If we do not teach the meaning of a tradition or offer
only a cardboard cut-out version of what the tradition actually stood for,
we cannot hope to get beyond traditionalism.</P>

<P>Tradition, on the other hand, is "the living faith of the dead" and is
characterized by an understanding of development within the tradition as
opposed to revolutions which tear at the tradition, uprooting it.  Pelikan
notes that it is precisely at the point at which a political system begins
to free itself from the immediate governance of received traditions
"...that formal ideologies tend first to emerge and take hold".<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A></P>

<P>Pelikan uses music as a meta-phor for thought and says that to refuse the
melodies of Athens and Jerusalem is "to be tone-deaf to tradition and
is, therefore, to be unable to hear the voices of the past or the present or of the future".<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></P>

<P>Any leap of progress, in history, says Pelikan, is not a standing broad
jump which begins where we are standing, but a running broad jump through
where we have been to where we go next.  The growth of insight in science,
the arts, philosophy, theology, politics and law has not come "... from
progressively sloughing off more and more of tradition, as though insight
would be purest and deepest when it has finally freed itself from a dead
past".</P>

<P>It simply has not worked that way in the history of the tradition and it
does not work that way now.  By including the dead in the circle of
discourse, we enrich the quality of the conversation: We do not listen only
to the dead, we are not, in Pelikan's words, simply  "...a tape-recording
of the tradition - that would be the dead faith of the living, not the
living faith of the dead".</P>

<P>Yet we do acquire insight when we learn to interact with the tradition.
And it is here that a serious problem is present in contemporary life in
all its aspects.  Let us take law for an example.  Legal philosophy has
not, for some time, been a required course at most Canadian law schools.
And even where courses are available, they are frequently taught from a
perspective that is critical of the traditions of jurisprudence without
evaluating them in any serious way.  Over recent years, this lack of
sympathy has taken on a more strident dimension and agrowing antipathy to
any notion of "fundamentality" is increasingly evident.  This lack of
sympathy with the fullness of tradition (as opposed to traditionalism) is
insufficient for those learning law because an understanding of
presuppositions and alternatives is essential to an understanding of why
law is one thing and not another.</P>

<P>What are we to make of the efforts of those who deny the value of
tradition yet seek to rely upon "rights and freedoms" or principles of
"dignity" or "equality"?  Just where do they think such things arise from?
What value would "rights" have if they are merely the whim of the day,
outmoded by popular feeling (or the control of elites, or consensus)
tomorrow or the day after?</P>

<P>Constitutional law becomes little more than a procedural game 
unless those involved in the process of argument and those adjudicating 
between alternative views have a proper grounding in the nature of the 
"fundamental rights and freedoms" that are recognized (but not created
by) the Charter of Rights.  Many now doubt whether such a basis has been given
to our current crop of judges and lawyers.  As G.K. Chesterton has reminded
us, if one wishes to have a white post, one needs to keep painting it white
or it will not remain so.  It is this way with our understanding of all aspects
of tradition - including our traditions of law and justice.</P>

<P>In other areas, it is interesting to observe the deconstruction of
deconstructionists who seem always to rest upon such foundations as
language to argue that there are no foundations.  For people who claim to
be skeptics, all the while using the language of belief,
it might be useful to recall what lies behind this type of skepticism.  As
the late Christopher Lasch wrote in his final book:</P>

<P>Once knowledge is equated with ideology it is no longer necessary to argue
with ones opponents on intellectual grounds or to enter into their point of
view.  It is enough to dismiss them as eurocentric, racist, sexist,
homophobic - in other words, as politically suspect.<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A></P>

<P>One could add to this list that it is now, in many quarters, politically
suspect to be thought "traditional".  Throughout the centuries many of the
greatest thinkers have discussed the importance of learning and preserving
the central truths which define the society.  These truths are not relative or
subjective but transcendent, and they lie embedded in the unconscious
foundations of practice.  In essence, such unconsciousness makes us ripe
for traditionalism.</P>

<P>Speaking at a conference on the Charter of Rights shortly after his
retirement from the Supreme Court of Canada, former Justice Willard Estey
once said, "You are asking the judges to answer questions we have not
been trained to deal with".  The late Canadian philosopher George Grant
commented upon contemporary judges and legal education: </P>

<P>The more contemporary judges quote philosophy or religious tradition
[Grant taught both], the less they appear to understand what they are
dealing with.  (Another long article would be required to spell out the
influences in legal and general
education that have led to this jurisprudential shallowness... the question
goes to the very roots of modernity).<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A></P>

<P>Yet law cannot be law and avoid morality - otherwise why ought one to obey
law?   And morality is, in one sense, a tradition.  The Law Reform
Commission of Canada noted the relationship between justice and morality in
their 1976 report, Our Criminal Law:</P>

<P>In truth, the criminal law is fundamentally a moral system.  It may be
crude, it may have faults, it may be rough and ready, but basically it is a
system of applied morality and justice.  It serves to underline those
values necessary, or else important, to society.  When acts occur that
seriously transgress essential values, like the sanctity of life, society
must speak out and reaffirm those values.  This is the true role of
criminal law .<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A></P>

<P>Leaving aside the use of that vague and misleading word "values" in the
above quotation (which casts doubt on what they mean by "morality"), lawand
society itself require tradition in order to function coherently.  Our
growing and, one might even say, collective, loss of the richness of our
living traditions does not bode well for law or for society.  Too many who
think they favour tradition are actually devotees of traditionalism (as
defined above) because they do not understand their tradition.  Many who
are critical of tradition are really criticizing traditionalism.  That both
groups are all too liable to speak of "values" shows just how widespread is
the co-option of the moral ends of the early tradition by inarticulate yet
diverse ends of the day.  This type of confusion is one more reason why the
Centre will necessarily investigate what tradition has to tell us in each
area we investigate.  Again, as Chesterton once put it, only tradition can
keep us from the danger of being slaves to our own time.</P>

<H2>FAMILY AUTONOMY AND THE CHARTER OF RIGHTS:<BR>Protecting Parental Liberty in a Child-Centered Legal System</H2>
<I>by Cindy Silver</I>

<P>Recognition of due process and the retained rights of parents
promotes values essential to the preservation of human freedom and dignity
and to the perpetuation of our democratic society.  The family is the
principal conservator and transmitter of cherished values and traditions.
Any invasion of the sanctity of the family, even for the loftiest motives,
unavoidably threatens those traditions and values.

<P>Family autonomy helps to assure the diversity characteristic of a
free society.  There is no surer way to preserve pluralism than to allow
parents maximum latitude in rearing their own children . . .  Conversely,
there is no surer way to threaten pluralism than to terminate the rights of
parents who contradict officially approved values imposed by reformers
empowered to determine what is in the 'best interests of the child."<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>

<P>Canadians live in a world where post-modern human rights are now a
driving force, challenging the philosophical and legal traditions on which
our social institutions are based.<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> This is nowhere so evident as in the
radical restructuring of the roles and relationships of the family and the
state,  while the state takes an evermore active role in protecting child
rights as defined under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child.<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>  This paper discusses the impact on the family of state attempts to
both define and protect "the best interests of the child."  In particular,
it brings to light internal contradictions in child-rights jurisprudence,
particularly when the state's power collides with the parent's right to
liberty under Section 7 of the Charter of Rights.

<P>This paper discusses recent ideological and legal developments that
challenge the a priori right of  parents to nurture, maintain and educate
their children free from undue interference of the state.  It reviews the
macro-social, philosophical and legal traditions that underlie Canada's
long- standing policy of respecting the autonomous nature of the nuclear
family.  It examines changes in federal and provincial policies as a result
of Canada's commitment to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of
the Child, the plan for which is contained in Brighter Futures:  Canada's
Action Plan for Children.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>   It discusses the role that non-governmental
organizations (N.G.O.s) currently play in initiating policy changes and how
this might be affected by a recent Supreme Court of Canada decision that
places parental rights squarely within Section 7 of the Charter of Rights.

<P><B>DECONSTRUCTING THE FAMILY, PROMOTING THE CHILD</B>

<P>As Canadian law and policy moves from an implicitly Christian framework to
an explicitly secular one, the conceptual roles and legal rights of family
members are being redefined.   The once implicit right of parents to raise
their children free from the undue intervention of the state has become
obscured, while the individual rights of children have become a primary
focus.

<P>Before the Charter, family autonomy and parental rights enjoyed a
quasi-constitutional legitimacy. This was derived primarily from the
Canadian Bill of Rights, the preamble of which states:

<P><I>The Parliament of Canada affirming that the Canadian Nation is founded upon
principles that acknowledge the supremacy of God, the dignity and worth of
the human person and the position of the family in a society of free men
and free institutions.

<P>Affirming also that men and institutions remain free only when freedom is
founded upon respect for social and spiritual values and the rule of law.</I>

<P>As a constitutional document, the Charter of Rights is now primary in
determining human-rights issues and, in practical application, prevails
over the Canadian Bill of Rights.  The Charter's preamble, now the
definitive purpose statement for the protection of human rights in Canada,
is much shorter and has deleted references to the family:

<P>Whereas Canada is founded upon the principles that
recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law.</I>

<P>By deleting express reference to the family, the Charter of Rights removed
from plain view the grounds for constitutional protection of parental and
family rights.  This omission has contributed significantly to the demise
of family autonomy and the devaluing of the family in law and legislation.

<P>Although the Charter failed to mention the family, it did specify
age as a prohibited ground for discrimination within Section 15(1), a
characteristic not mentioned in the anti-discrimination provisions of the
Canadian Bill of Rights.  Section 15(1) states:

<P><I>Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the
equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without
discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion,
sex, age or mental or physical disability.</I>

<P>The inclusion of age as a prohibited ground for discrimination effectively
changed the constitutional status of children to one of prima facie
equality with adults.  Although age-based challenges have proved unlikely
to succeed, the fact remains that any legislation that distinguishes
children from adults based on age is vulnerable to challenge under  Section
15 (1).

<P>Even as the Charter was being developed and implemented in Canada,
there was a growing sense elsewhere that the rights of children were being
ignored.  Initially there was concern than, at the very least, children
should be guaranteed protective  rights, including the right to proper
nutrition, basic medical care, hygiene and literacy, and the right to be
protected from child labor, child prostitution, and the atrocities of war.
Then, as child-rights theory became more sophisticated, human-rights groups
included their concern that there was an 'epidemic' of family violence,
including child abuse, in the developed world.<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>

<P>Child-rights advocates argued that abuse within the family  was
rooted in and perpetuated  by the hierarchical authority structure of the
traditional family and by the veil of privacy that discouraged government
intervention in family matters. The solution, they  believed,  was for the
state to shift the balance of power in the parent-child relationship
through policies that would define and limit the power of the parent while
increasing the power of child.  This would  necessarily include changing
the legal status of the child from an integral part of the family unit to
an individual rights-possessor, and then conferring on  the child explicit
decision-making choice rights .

<P>In 1979, the United Nations (U.N.) proclaimed the International
Year of the Child, an event that set in motion a ten-year process that
culminated in the drafting of  the United Nations Convention on the Rights
of the Child.  The final document reflects an attempt to address all of the
concerns raised by child-rights groups.  As a result, the U.N. Convention
confers both protective  rights,  and  choice rights, thereby establishing
a presumption that children should be able to act autonomously whenever
possible.

<P>The Convention, which Canada ratified in December, 1991, includes
the following choice rights:<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>

<P><I>Article 13 - the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to
seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds . . . whether
orally or in writing, in the form of art . . . or through  any other media
of the child's choice.<BR>
Article 14 - the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.<BR>
Article 15 - the right to freedom of association.<BR>
Article 16 - the right to privacy.<BR>
Article 19 - the right to be free from all forms of physical and mental
violence.</I><A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>

<P>The U.N. Convention and the Charter of Rights have become powerful
companions for defining the scope of child-rights.  Together, these
documents function as the reference point for the development of
child-rights law in Canada.  Both documents emphasize the state's role in
protecting the autonomy of the individual against the institutions of
society.  In functional terms, this has recast the state and its courts as
child-advocate against parents.

<P>In a recent article, Iain Benson, Senior Research Fellow with the
Centre  for Renewal in Public Policy, discusses the theoretical and
functional chaos that is being created as our society attempts to separate
the technique of the academic disciplines from a shared understanding as to
their purpose within the social good.<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>     Recent developments in
child-rights law illustrate the problem Benson describes. The technique, or
theory, that defines child rights has expanded and become more
sophisticated, while a shared understanding as to the purpose of child
rights as components of the social good has become increasingly narrow.
This separation of technique and purpose  largely  explains the present
confusion as to the goals of child-rights law reform, not only among
academics  but  among the offices of government and the  courts.   Having
severed the connection between its technique and its purpose, child-rights
theory, policy and law are in chaos; our society is trying to define child
rights without clear reference to family autonomy or parental rights, and
without deference to the best interests of society.   This is a no-win
situation, analogous to placing children in a speeding vehicle on an
unmarked road with no clear destination.

<P><B>CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES AND THE ROLE OF N.G.O.s</B>

<P>A brief review of a few recent cases best illustrates the present chaos in
child-rights law reform. In May 1995,  in the case of  R. v. Carmen M., the
Ontario Court of Appeal struck down Section 159 of the Criminal Code after
the defendant argued successfully that this section violated Section 15(1)
of the Charter of Rights.<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>  In this case, the defendant was charged under
Section 159 for engaging in anal sex with a fourteen-year-old youth.
Section 159 made it a criminal offense to engage in anal sex unless both
parties consented and were at least 18 years-old or married.  In contrast,
the age of consent for heterosexual sex was 14 years.  Focusing on the
discrepancy in the law regarding the age of consent, the accused argued
that this section violated the equality rights of youth to consent to anal
sex after age 14.

<P>The Crown conceded that the age distinction created by Section 159
was discriminatory, but argued that the distinction was justified under
Section 1 of the Charter.  They argued that the section had a legitimate
objective in protecting young persons from engaging in a specific form of
sexual activity, anal intercourse, for which there were increased risks of
physical and psychological problems, including the transmission of HIV.
However, Madame Justice Russell, relying on the recent federal court
decision in  Halm  v. Canada, struck down the law on the grounds that it
discriminated on the basis of both age and sexual orientation.<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>

<P>In  Halm  v Canada, Mr.  Halm  was denied immigrant status and
faced extradition after authorities learned that he had recently failed to
appear for sentencing after being convicted of ten sex offenses in New York
State, including five counts of sodomy and three counts of endangering the
welfare of a child.<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>

<P>Halm  appealed Canada's decision to deport him back to New York
State for sentencing.  He argued that Section 159, the Canadian equivalent
of the charge for which he had been convicted, contained an age discrepancy
that violated Section 15(1) of the Charter, therefore rendering the section
unconstitutional and invalid.  He argued that, in the absence of Section
159,  the acts for which he was convicted would have been legal if they had
occurred in Canada, therefore the immigration officials lacked the grounds
necessary to deport him.

<P>In  Halm  v. Canada, Madame Justice Reed held that Section 159
violated the Charter on both the enumerated ground of age and the analogous
ground of sexual orientation.  Like Madame Justice Russell in Carmen M.,
she  rejected the government's argument that the section served three
legitimate objectives, reinforcing moral precepts, inhibiting youth from
engaging in anal sexual activity and protecting youth from the increased
risk of HIV transmission.

<P>In rejecting the first objective, Madame Justice Reed stated:

<P><I>I agree that there has always been a close connection between the Criminal
Code and moral values.  That does not mean, however, that today in our
pluralistic society,  moral values alone can justify making an activity
criminal.  If it could, one immediately has to ask,  by whose moral values
is the state to be guided?   I am not persuaded that in a free and
democratic society it is justifiable to make an activity criminal merely
because a segment, indeed maybe a majority, of the citizenry consider it to
be immoral.</I><A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>

<P>Responding to the second and third legislative objectives, to discourage
anal sex and prevent HIV transmission among youth, Madame Justice Reed
stated:

<P><I>All of the evidence indicates that AIDS is spread by a number of activities
(sharing needles among drug users, blood transfusions, both anal and
vaginal sex).  In absolute numbers, it would appear that anal sex is the
least frequent method of transmission. It is not rational to make one such
activity a criminal offense and not the others.  Also, while unprotected
anal sex may be riskier, as a potential conduit for HIV transmission than
vaginal sex, in both cases it is unprotected sex which is the cause, not
the activity itself.  </I><A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>

<P>In both  Halm and Carmen M., the government did not appeal, notwithstanding
the fact that a Quebec court facing the same issue that year upheld Section
159 in a well-reasoned judgement.<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>

<P>Several child-rights groups, including a government-funded  N.G.O.
called Justice for Children and Youth, intervened in Carmen  M.  to strike
down Section 159.   The  final ruling of the court was described by the
intervenors as a victory for the right of youth to make sexual choices and
to have equal legal access to all sexual activity.

<P>It is difficult to understand how this could be construed as a
significant advance for children's rights as contemplated by early
proponents of  protective rights for children.  However, the issue in this
case was one of  choice rights and was based on an unqualified concept of
youth as individual rights-possessors. This accounts for the complete
failure of the court to justify its decision in terms of the "best
interests of the child," or to refer anywhere to the autonomy of the family
or to the interests of parents in policy issues that could potentially
effect their children.

<P>Justice for Children and Youth is one of several child-rights
N.G.O.s  presently playing a leading role in child-rights law reform in
Canada.  This is unsettling given that the ideology of many influential
child-rights N.G.O.s is not only inordinately child-centered, but in many
cases, antipathetic to established authority.  The focus of these
organizations is too often on defending the child against authority,
whether exercised by social agents or parents.

<P>The activities of organizations such as Justice for Children and
Youth illustrate the functional chaos that is resulting as the Canadian
government funds and mobilizes N.G.O.s in order to promote child rights
without a contextual framework that gives due weight to parental rights.

<P>Since 1992, the federal government has allocated $459 million
toward conforming Canada's law and policy to the provisions of the U.N.
Convention.  Part of this amount was used in 1992 to create the Children's
Bureau of Health Canada, whose mandate is to "ensure consistency and
coordination for all federal programs and policies for children."<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
  From its inception, the Children's Bureau has worked with federal and provincial
N.G.O.s to develop and implement Brighter Futures:  Canada's Action Plan
for Children, which is a massive effort  "to work through all sectors of
society - business, labor, communities, other governments, N.G.O.s,
families and individuals - to improve the lives of children."<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
Most state intervention in the parent-child relationship occurs at the
provincial level.  Provincial legislation empowers social workers to
undertake measures that intrude on the autonomy of the family and the
rights of the parents.  For example, social workers are empowered to
conduct inquiries and petition the court for a variety of orders with
regard to a family under investigation.  The court may give child
protection authorities supervisory powers over the family, including
unannounced "spot visits" to the family home, the power to interview
children on demand or in the absence of a parent, and the power to require
a suspect parent to attend one or more counseling programs.  As well, the
authorities may seek an order restraining a parent from being alone with
the child, or having any direct contact with the child, or returning to the
family home.  It may make recommendations to the court regarding parental
access to, and alternative placement of, the child.  Finally, the child
protection agency may seek an order for wardship of the child.

<P>The powers of government authorities in child protection
proceedings are manifold compared to those of the parent.  The state, with
all of its personnel and money, is pitted directly against the parent.  Yet
the procedural safeguards are minimal.  The cases indicate that even though
protection authorities exercise quasi-judicial powers, the standard of
proof in child protection proceedings is, at best,  based on a balance of
probabilities.<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>   Under provincial law, all that authorities require
before initiating an intrusive investigation of a family is one complaint
by an anonymous third party.  Under provincial legislation, a child may be
apprehended if the social worker decides they fit within the catch-all term
a "child in need of protection".   Although this term is well defined by
the legislation, unclear procedural and evidentiary standards often mean
that state interference in the family is based on assumptions rather than
facts, leaving a disquieting margin for error.18  The powers of social
workers might be necessary, but it is imperative that these powers
expressly require not only justification and responsibility but procedural
safeguards as well.

<P>The following cases illustrate the tragic impact this can have on a
family. Until February, 1995, Charles and Sandra Butler home-schooled their
children, ages eleven, eight and five.<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>  According to Newfoundland law,
parents are allowed  to home-educate their  children as long as the
curriculum they use is accredited  by the district school board.  The
Butlers followed a home-school curriculum developed by the Seventh Day
Adventist Church, one that the school board had refused to accredit. The
family had no past history of neglect or abuse.

<P>In February 1995, the Department of Social Services decided that
the Butler children were in need of protection as contemplated by the
province's Child Welfare Act on the ground that the Butlers had neglected
to provide adequately for the education of their children.  However, within
hours of apprehending the children, the Butlers realized  that   their
five-year-old  was not required by law to begin school until September;
therefore, the  grounds for apprehension could not rightly apply to her.
Not wanting to release any of the children without further investigation,
Social Services reapplied to the court to amend the application.  Four days
after the initial apprehension,  Mr. Justice Handrigan granted Social
Services four months temporary custody of the children based on an expanded
list of grounds.  These included,  not only concerns about the education of
the children, but also concerns about the children's health and medical
care, the possibility of physical and /or mental abuse of the children and
the religious zealotry and fervor of the parents.

<P>The Butlers retained counsel and appealed the order on several
grounds: that the judge applied an improper standard of proof,   that he
relied on inadmissible evidence and hearsay, and that the hearing violated
the principles of fundamental justice in that the appellants were
unrepresented, were not properly informed of the nature of the hearing, and
were not given an opportunity to call evidence.<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>  On appeal, Dunn J.
reviewed the evidence that the trial judge had relied on:

<P>[The Butlers] are adherents to a breakaway sect of the Seventh Day.
Adventist Church.  They associate with people of like religious views and
practice a lifestyle which may be regarded, by some, as out of the norm.
They are vegetarians and follow a strict dietary regime.  The children are
permitted two meals a day.  They are not allowed liquids with their meals
or for one hour prior to and one hour after same.  The children have not
been immunized as recommended by the Department of Health, Newfoundland.
Instilling certain religious beliefs in reference to the Bible is
fundamental to the lifestyle of the appellants.  For example, they believe
that the end of the world is fast approaching and are teaching their
children to expect and prepare for same.


<P>In December 1995, the court granted the Butler's appeal and ordered that
the children be immediately returned to their parents. In her conclusions,
Dunn J. found that the Butler's parental rights under Section 7 of the
Charter of Rights had been violated. She concluded that the children's
academic abilities seemed normal for their age, they appeared
well-adjusted, were physically healthy, were rarely sick and that there was
absolutely no evidence that the parents physically or mentally abused the
children.  In response to the Butler's claims of fundamental and procedural
injustice, Dunn J. stated:

<P><I>Where parental rights to custody of children and the possible deprivation
of such custody are at issue, proper procedure and reasonable notice are
essential to the process. The application was not conducted in a manner in
keeping with the principles of fundamental justice and on this basis alone
I would have been prepared to grant the appeal.</I><A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>

<P>Although  the Butler children were eventually returned to their
parents, they had spent more than six months in foster care.  The
devastating results  that  this has had, and will continue to have, on the
family and on their relationship to their community cannot be
underestimated.

<P>The Butler's case is not isolated.  Similar incidents are occurring
across Canada.  In June 1995, for example, a Nanaimo couple's three
children were apprehended by Social Services on grounds later described by
an attending psychiatrist as diagnostic speculations.     The event
occurred after Terry and Lisa Neave's two-year-old daughter, Karianna,  was
transferred from Nanaimo General Hospital to B.C. Children's Hospital in
Vancouver for testing and treatment of a choking disorder.  One day before
the transfer, the Nanaimo pediatrician taught Mrs. Neave a  jaw-thrust
manoeuvre  that would clear her daughter's airway when she was choking.
This manoeuvre involved raising the child's jaw with a hand at her neck.

<P>At Children's Hospital, Lisa and Karianna Neave were assigned to a
double room, which they shared with another mother and her sick child.  The
mother observed Mrs. Neave perform the manoeuvre during Karianna's choking
episodes, suspected that this was abuse and reported her suspicions to
hospital authorities. Soon after, the head of the hospital's child
protection unit (C.P.U.), together with a social worker, questioned Lisa
Neave, at which time she  explained her doctor's instructions.

<P>The C.P.U. director did not contact the Neave's pediatrician or
family doctor because, as she later told the court, it was not her
responsibility to do a thorough investigation. She diagnosed Mrs. Neave as
having Munchausen by Proxy Syndrome (M.P.S.), an unusual form of child
abuse in which a parent fabricates an illness for their child and allows
multiple unnecessary investigations and treatments. The next day, social
services apprehended all three of the Neave's children.  Later,  in family
court, the judge accepted the social worker's recommendation that Mrs.
Neave was  high-risk  and that the children should be temporarily placed
with their grandparents. The order allowed Mrs. Neave to visit her children
under supervision, but she could not be alone with them.

<P>The only evidence before the court was the C.P.U. director's
diagnosis and an affidavit by Mrs. Neave's cousin, a social worker, who
stated that Mrs. Neave was  "emotionally troubled  and a  good person
struggling with huge problems . . . who may very well be crying out for
help in the only way she knew how."   At trial, the cousin conceded that he
had never seen Mrs. Neave do anything in his presence that could be
misconstrued as abuse.  In fact, no one had ever seen Mrs. Neave abuse her
children. In the meantime, the Neave's family doctor and pediatrician tried
to contact the acting social worker but reported that their calls were not
returned.

<P>In December, the children were allowed to come home, with Mr. Neave
acting as supervisor over his wife.   In January, the results of  a
court-ordered psychiatric assessment of Mrs. Neave concluded that Mrs.
Neave's only psychological problem was caused by the apprehension of her
children and by an R.C.M.P. interrogation shortly thereafter.  In February,
the Ministry of Social Services applied to the court to have all orders
against Mrs. Neave set aside.  At the time the orders were set aside, the
Neave children had lived away from home for five months and the Neave's
legal bills exceeded $10,000.

<P>As these cases illustrate, the margin for error in Canada's child
protection laws place families in a vulnerable position.  This is not to
say that the state has no role in protecting children.  Society has a
vested interest in ensuring that a child's best interests are served. There
are times when the state's power to intervene in cases of genuine physical
or sexual abuse or neglect are crucial.   A parents rights do not trump the
rights of their child. Neither are the two necessarily opposed.  The rights
of the child must be paramount. However, where the parent and the state
disagree on the child's best interests, the law must begin with the
presumption that the parent, and not the state, is right.   Beginning at
this point places the onus on the state to rebut the presumption according
to the principles of fundamental justice.

<P>For example, when a parent administers corporal discipline in a
manner that a child-protection worker decides is abusive, but which the
parent believes is appropriate in the circumstances, it should be presumed
that the parent is in the  best position to assess the situation and act
with the child's best interests in mind.  In Ogg-Moss v. R  (1983), 41 C.R.
297 (S.C.C.), the Supreme Court concluded that if corporal discipline was
administered reasonably, and was intended for the benefit and education of
the child, this constitutes legitimate discipline falling within Section 43
of the Criminal Code.  A chronological study of the case law suggests that
the risk of successfully invoking Section 43 to justify physical injury to
a child is steadily diminishing. Prosecutors and judges are more aware of
child abuse and are more responsive to protecting children's  rights than
were earlier courts.  This observation was recently made by one of Canada's
leading authorities on family rights, Queen's University law professor
Nicholas Bala.  In a presentation made to the Consultation on Section 43 of
the Criminal Code, Professor Bala stated that:

<P>The law and its application has clearly changed in the last two or
three years.  Court decisions interpreting Section 43 are moving away from
tolerating the levels of physical injury to children cited from earlier
years.  While there are differences between judges and even between the
courts of appeal of the different provinces, positive change may best come
about through the development of case law to reflect changing attitudes
toward the acceptance of severe corporal punishment of children.<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>

<P>It then becomes incumbent on the  child protection  worker to rebut the
presumption with evidence that is directly probative of the ultimate
question, is this child in need of protection as contemplated by the
legislation?  Speculative allegations would not in and of themselves be
sufficiently probative to justify apprehension.

<P>Placing family autonomy and parental rights squarely within Section
7 of the Charter of Rights would be a significant step toward ensuring a
more equitable child-protection system.  Deference to parental rights would
not detract from the rights of the child; it would protect the child
against the trauma that accompanies wrongful apprehension and temporary
placement away from  home and family.  In addition, it would provide some
protection to parents against the formidable powers of the state, which are
sometimes exercised in ways that do not comply with the principles of
natural justice.

<P>In December 1994, for example, the  Children's Aid Society (C.A.S)
began to investigate an Ontario family after someone in the change room of
a local swimming pool noticed a bruise on the boy's bottom.  A C.A.S worker
requested that she be allowed to come into the family home and examine the
child.  The parents refused, insisting instead that they would have their
family doctor examine the child as quickly as possible and submit a report
to the  C.A.S.  The doctor s report indicated that there was a transient
bruise on the boy's bottom.  The father  readily admitted to  the C.A.S.
worker that he had spanked his son after the  boy  kicked the family cat
and then refused to go to his  room.  The father explained that he had
carried his son, kicking and screaming,  to  the boy's bedroom, where he
proceeded to  smack the boy's  bottom  with a belt.   The father
acknowledged that the spanking  in question was  excessive and that
bruising a child was not within the purview of reasonable corporal
discipline.  However, he maintained that this was an isolated incident,
unlikely to recur.<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>

<P>The C.A.S. tried to have the couple sign a contract agreeing to
refrain from using corporal punishment to discipline their children. The
couple had six children between one and nine years of age.  This was the
first allegation of abuse against either parent.  The couple refused,
stating that they believed corporal punishment was an appropriate form of
discipline reserved for instances of blatant disobedience or defiance.
They retained a lawyer and attempted to negotiate with the C.A.S.  The next
day, with no advance warning to the father, two police officers arrested
him at his place of work.  In the presence of his co-workers, the father
was charged with assault causing bodily harm and assault with a weapon.  He
was handcuffed and taken into custody pending a bail hearing.

<P>In May 1995, six months and eight court appearances after the
father was charged, the Crown, without explanation, asked the court to stay
the proceedings.  By this time, the family had incurred approximately
$8,000 in legal fees and much emotional stress.  As a result of the ordeal,
the husband believed his opportunities for advancement with his employer
had been seriously undermined.

<P>This case, like Butler and Neave, raises questions about
fundamental justice and procedural fairness in child-protection cases.
Much of what occurred would not have, if family autonomy and parental
rights were clearly understood to be within the scope of Section 7 of the
Charter.

<P>The theoretical and functional chaos that characterizes much of
Canada's child-rights policies is due in large part to Parliament's failure
to ensure that the Charter of Rights expressly protects family autonomy and
parental rights.  In order to reintroduce the contextual purpose into
child-rights theory, policy-makers must recognize again that protecting
family autonomy is foundational to ensuring the best interests of the
child.

<P>Recently, the  Supreme Court of Canada took steps to initiate the
recognition of family autonomy by importing American jurisprudence that
supports the inclusion of both parental rights and family autonomy as
protected liberties within the meaning of Section 7 of the Charter.

<P><B>WHAT IS FAMILY AUTONOMY?</B>

<P>In 1982, the Utah Supreme Court provided that family autonomy should be
among the primary objectives of the state:

<P><I>The parental liberty right at issue . . . is fundamental to the existence
of the institution of the family . . . Recognition of the due process and
retained right of parents promotes values [that are] essential to the
preservation of human freedom and dignity and to the perpetuation of our
democratic society.  The family is the principal conservator and
transmitter of cherished values and traditions . . . Any invasion of the
sanctity of the family, even with the loftiest motives, unavoidably
threatens those traditions and values.</I><A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>

<P>Family autonomy is recognized and protected in several  international
human-rights documents of which Canada is a signatory. For example,  the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides:

<P><I>Art. 12.  No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his
privacy, family, home or correspondence . . . Everyone has the right to the
protection of the law against such interference.</I><A HREF="#1"><SUP>25</SUP></A>

<P>Similarly, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides:

<P><I>Art. 23.1  The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society
and is entitled to protection by society and the State.</I><A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>

<P>As referred to earlier, the Canadian Bill of Rights states in its preamble:

<P><I>The Canadian Nation is founded upon principles that acknowledge the
supremacy of God, the dignity and worth of the human person and the
position of the family in a society of free men and free institutions.</I><A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>

<P>In addition, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
states in its preamble:

<P><I>Convinced that the family, as the fundamental group of society and the
natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members and
particularly children, should be afforded the necessary protection and
assistance so that it can fully assume its responsibilities in the
community.</I><A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>

<P>The pro-family provisions of these documents reflect an age-old
philosophical tradition that it is in the public interest to support and
protect the family.  This tradition has developed out of the commonly-held
belief of societies throughout history that the family is the principal
social institution, uniquely equipped to carry out various functions that
advance the public interest (including care for the physical, economic and
relational needs of its members) with minimal reliance on the state.<A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>

<P>Today, child-rights advocates argue against using the traditional
concept of family.  They want to change what they consider as blatant
inequalities and injustices within the traditional family structure.   It
is increasingly common for child-rights groups to call on the state to
invoke its  parens patriae jurisdiction in order to remedy these
injustices.<A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>

<P>Events of the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women, held recently
in Beijing,  illustrate this ideology in action on an international level.
In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights defined the family as
"the natural and fundamental group unit of society . . . entitled to
protection by society and the state."  Contrast that statement with the
dismissive  mention of the family in the conference's Platform for Action:
"In many cases, violence against women and girls occurs in the family or in
the home . . . violence against women throughout the life cycle derives
essentially from cultural patterns, in particular the harmful effects of
certain traditional or customary practices. . ."

<P>This statement would be fine if it were clear that traditional and
customary practices referred to such things as genital mutilation, female
infanticide, and child marriage.  When read within the context of the
Platform for Action though, this statement has a wider application which
includes the traditional family structure. Mary Ann Glendon, Learned Hand
Professor of Law at Harvard University and leader of the Vatican delegation
to the Beijing Conference, made the following observations about the
treatment of the family and the role of the parent in the Platform for
Action,   "The documents barely mention marriage, motherhood, and the
family - except negatively as impediments to women's self actualization
(and as associated with violence and oppression)."<A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>

<P>Professor Glendon also noted that a coalition of countries,
including Canada, opposed any affirmation of parental rights.  "Though the
Beijing documents had identified the situation of the 'girl child' as a
'critical area', the coalition attempted to eliminate all recognition of
parental rights and duties from the draft. ...They seemed indifferent to
the fact that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequent
human rights documents have consistently protected the parent-child
relationship from outside intrusion."<A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>

<P><B>CONCLUSION:<BR>
EXTENDING CHARTER PROTECTION TO THE FAMILY</B>

<P>In January 1995, in  R (B.) v. Metro Toronto Children's Aid Society, the
Supreme Court of Canada undertook an in-depth analysis of the liberty right
referred to in Section 7 of the Charter of Rights and its application to
family autonomy and parental rights.  In this case, the appellants,
Jehovah's Witnesses, declined to allow their infant daughter to receive
blood transfusions which the attending medical doctors believed necessary
to preserve the child's life.  Responding to their refusal, the C.A.S.
secured an order for temporary wardship of the child and authorized the
hospital to perform the transfusions.  Authorities returned the infant to
her parents once the transfusions were complete. The appellants challenged
the Ontario Child Welfare Act, arguing that its power to force temporary
wardship of their child, based only on their refusal to consent to a blood
transfusion,  infringed the appellants' right to choose medical treatment
for their infant, contrary to Section 7 of the Charter of Rights.

<P>Although the Supreme Court of Canada rightly rejected the appeal on
the ground that the child's right to life will always supersede the
parent's right to make medical decisions for the child, this case is
extremely significant for what it says about parental rights and family
autonomy.  The court considered "instructive" a series of court decisions
defining the relationship between family autonomy and liberty in the
American Bill of Rights.  The court followed the reasoning in these cases
to conclude that the liberty right in Section 7 of the Charter includes the
right of individuals to pursue family life free from  undue interference by
the state.  The court concluded that the individual's right to pursue
family life included the right of parents to make decisions on matters that
affect their children.  Writing for Gonthier,  McLachlin, L'Heureux-Dube,
JJ.  and himself,  Mr. Justice LaForest made the following statement:

<P><I>. . . the American experience can give us valuable guidance as to the
proper meaning and limits of liberty.  The United States Supreme Court has
given a liberal interpretation to the concept of liberty, as it relates to
family matters.  It has elevated both the notion of the integrity of the
family unit and that of parental rights to the status of constitutional
values through its interpretation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments .
. .  Although [in Canada the parents'] liberty interest is not a parental
right tantamount to a right of property in children, our society is far
from having repudiated the privileged role parents exercise in the
upbringing of their children.  This role translates into a protected sphere
of parental decision-making which is rooted in the presumption that parents
should make important decisions affecting their children because parents
are more likely to appreciate the best interests of their children and
because the state is ill-equipped to make such decisions itself.

<P>. . . I would have thought it plain that the right to nurture a
child, to care for its development, and to make decisions for it in
fundamental matters such as medical care, are part of the liberty interest
of a parent.  We must accept that parents can, at times, make decisions
contrary to their children's wishes - and rights - as long as they do not
exceed the threshold dictated by public policy, in its broadest context.</I><A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>

<P>In conclusion, the chaos that characterizes child-rights law reform can be
remedied only by substantive and procedural recognition of the value of the
family and the importance of its autonomy within society.  This requires
recognition that the present direction of child-rights law is in some
respects unbalanced and thus corrosive of the importance of the family in
society. The way to affirm its importance would be to, once again, give it
explicit recognition within the Canadian constitution. This would be best
achieved by an amendment to the Charter of Rights to include the family,
and continued development of case law built on the Supreme Court of
Canada's judgement in  R.(B.).  The former could be done in tandem with
provincial measures to affirm the importance of the family in provincial
human-rights legislation or in separate legislation for that purpose.
Amendment of the Federal Human Rights Act could be important to clarify
Justice Minister Rock's assurances that the recent inclusion of "sexual
orientation" as an enumerated ground for the purpose of protection from
discrimination was not intended to indicate any alteration to definitions
of "spouse" or "family" for matters under federal jurisdiction (this would
be in line with the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Egan v.
Canada).<A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>

<P>By extending Charter protection to parental rights and family
autonomy, the Supreme Court of Canada has laid a foundation for renewing
the constitutional status of the family.  It is significant that in Butler
and Butler, the  Newfoundland Supreme Court relied on the majority
judgement in R. (B.), and quoted the words of Mr. Justice LaForest as
authority for the protection of parental rights within Section 7 of the
Charter of Rights.  At best, this renewed recognition of the family could
restore a much-needed balance to the administrative and judicial policies
of the state on matters relating to the parent-child relationship.

the United Nation's 50th anniversary report, Our Global Neighborhood, the
post-war objective was to develop an international community to foster
commonality on economic and social matters.  The guiding principles were
general and included a respect for life, a sense of liberty, justice,
equity, and integrity, and a commitment to mutual caring.  This contrasts
with post-modern human rights theory in which the focus is on protecting
individual autonomy and eliminating perceived inequalities between social

Section 43 of the Criminal Code, the section that allows parents to use
corporal discipline reasonable in the circumstances to correct their
children.  In this document, the Committee specifically recommends that
Canada prohibit all corporal discipline of children.  Lobby groups within
Canada, including the Canadian Coalition on the Rights of the Child and the
Repeal 43 Committee, have relied on the Committee's recommendation to argue
that the government is obliged to repeal  Section 43 in order to fulfill
its commitments under the Convention.  In fact, neither the Convention nor
the Committee's recommendations have legal force in Canadian law.  However,
they have added considerable political and persuasive weight to the

family throughout history.  For instance, Max Rheinstein, the comparative
law scholar from the University of Chicago,  in an article in The
International Encyclopedia of Comparative Law describes the family as
"pre-legal," noting that, for  most of history, the state existed not as an
aggregate of individuals, but of "family clans" or "houses."

<P><A NAME=30>30. Parens patriae, translated into English means "the state is the parent
of society."  However, child- rights groups advocating greater state
control of the family stretch the doctrine of parens patriae  beyond what
the jurisprudence can support.   In Hepton v Matt, [1957] S.C.R. 606 at
607-08, Mr. Justice Rand made clear that parens patriae was never intended
or used to justify the broad regulation of family life by the state.  The
kind of state authority that child-rights advocates promote more accurately
describes what some academics have termed the therapeutic state.  The
therapeutic state refers to a government structure in which the casework
method of social philanthropy is linked to the coercive power of the state,
with the result that "there are no rights except those of individuals and
the state."  See Mary Ann Glendon, The Transformation of Family Law,

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>

<P>Court decisions come at a rapid pace and in no logical subject order.  Only
when they are described together does a pattern emerge; for those
interested in judicial decisions that touch on religious belief or
practice, and have been concerned about the direction of those decisions,
the cases gathered here will provide clear evidence for their concerns.

<P>Dr. Ogilvie reviews court decisions that show the regard (and disregard)
courts have had for faith.  She focuses on the virtual banishment of
religion qua religion especially from the public square.  A banishment
that, quite apart from its injustice, is startling due to the fact that it
is out of all measure to the proportion of Canadians who profess religious
belief.  This paper catalogues some of the more surprising decisions in
connection with education, employment, family life, health, the welfare
state and intrusion into ecclesiastical affairs.  Dr. Ogilvie raises the
spectre that, as she puts it, "the gradual eradication of the religious
voice from the public square in Canada should not distract us from the fact
of that eradication and the threat it poses to liberty generally."

<P>A few years ago, an Atlantic Monthly article by Glenn Tinder discussed the
question of its title,  "Can We Be Good Without God?"  Dr. Ogilvie's paper
raises a wider question: can our society  remain democratic without
maintenance of a flourishing religious basis?  After all, religious freedom
and political freedom evolved hand-in-hand.  Can we maintain, for example,
respect for persons but avoid an examination of the spiritual and moral
ends of both person and state?  Those raised within the nominal shell of
religious faith were nonetheless imbued with its precepts, however
inadequately they were taught to ground them on religious presuppositions.

<P>Because the former shell of nominalism has, in large part, vanished,
liberal parents look with horror on children who do not accept their
taken-for-granted "ought" propositions.  But one cannot give what one does
not have.  When morality is no longer taught for fear of "imposition," the
temptation is to rely on retribution.  While law and morality have their
respective spheres, it is questionable whether law can function properly
without morality.  Justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be
done, and to see it as being done, one must know what justice looks like,
that is an essentially moral vision.

<P>Dr. Ogilvie notes that "... accommodation has too often metamorphosed into
assimilation, so that purportedly Christian communities often minimize and
trivialize belief to the point of non-recognition."  Neither nominalism nor
the reduction of virtues to values can pass on a flourishing form of the
faith that gives life and frame to culture.

<P>Near the end of her paper, Dr. Ogilvie notes that "the revival of freedom
of religion and of the religious voice in public discourse may well be
essential to the re-formulation of the liberal state on the basis of
genuine pluralism and equality.  If we go on as we have recently done, the
prospect before us is truly frightening."  As with all Centre
publications, it is hoped that this paper will prompt reflection and
discussion for those concerned with all aspects of public policy
formulation in Canada.

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>

<P>What are we to make of a culture that seems to have developed amnesia,
insecurity, and "chronological snobbery" at roughly the same time?  For
that seems to be our condition judging by how we approach contemporary
education.  The amnesia relates to just about every aspect of the necessary
links between character, culture, and education.   The insecurity seems to
relate to anything to do with morality, and the "chronological snobbery" to
the common (largely implicit) belief that the most recent innovation is
more valuable than that developed in time past.  Yet the forgetfulness,
insecurity and faddishness are not total, and it is in an effort to
overcome the polariztion that exists between "progressives" and
"traditionalists" that Dr. Gow has written this paper.

<P>If we examine the current situation a little more closely, we note
some inconsistencies: while contemporary models say it is inappropriate to
commit the "moral imperialism" of suggesting that there are standards of
conduct that are simply better than others, it is still somehow definitely
wrong to be intolerant or to say anything that might make another
uncomfortable or damage "self-esteem."  Such "relativism" is of a soft or
mushy type and its inconsistencies suggest that it may yet be worked with.
Commentators in the 1930's and 1940's indicated that a proper teaching of
freedom required a firm sense of rights and duties.  These writers
expressed concern that disastrous shifts had already occurred which, unless
corrected, would threaten society itself.

<P>In Education at the Crossroads  (New Haven: Yale, 1943), the French
philosopher and theologian Jacques Maritain,  said that the task of moral
re-education is "really a matter of public emergency" (p.93).   It was
clear to Maritain that "...for the educational body as well as for the
individual citizen, freedom, rights, and autonomy have responsibility,
duties, and moral obligations as their correlatives.  In the human
commonwealth, freedom and authority are as necessary for one another, by
virtue of the nature of things, as their occasional conflicts are
inevitable in actual fact" (p.98).   Yet it is precisely the inter-related
nature of moral obligations with true freedom that contemporary education
disdains and its confident avoidance of yesterday's truths makes it
vulnerable to the latest fad.

<P>Where concern about "victimization" and "empowerment" within an
increasingly vapid framework of "values clarification," has usurped
teaching about how choices relate to character and why certain conduct is
virtuous, education has lost its way.  In this paper, Dr. Gow focuses on a
particularly good example of the current debased educational approach - the
notion that education is primarily about furthering "self-esteem."

<P>As against the individualistic and relativistic tendencies of a
"self-esteem" focused education, Dr. Gow suggests the need to construct a
"moral vision" for today's students.   Her paper suggests that it is
necessary to break through the polarization between the traditionalist and
the progressive camps in an effort ". . . to come to grips with questions
of the essential nature of education and methodologies which link these
essentials."   In the course of her evaluation she notes that ". . . it
will be obvious that one is working from the premise that intellectual and
moral endeavours are inter-related and that this has very fundamental
connections for the good life, morality, amorality, immorality and not
least toward discovery of the real self."  In short, to have any meaningful
"self-esteem" one must have a meaningful sense of a real self.  An "itch
and scratch" existence is simply not adequate.  What is needed is a moral
vision that must excite and convince and be freely chosen.  It is implicit
that to be chosen, it must at least be presented and it is against the
stunning banality of the choices presented to today's students that the
exciting  possibilities of the author's suggestions will be immediately
evident.

<P>Such a moral vision, she says, cannot be indoctrinated if it is to
be valid.  Free assent based on their own reasoning from their own
experiences will lead to a conviction that certain forms of conduct etc.
are the only approaches conducive to "genuine community."  Yet, in the face
of  "self-esteem," moral visions about what is best and noble are not
likely to be taught much less, as Gow argues, experienced.  We must first
see how flawed and insufficient the current approaches are.  Many of the
strategies for building self-esteem are misdirected since they address only
the material manifestation of discontent rather than tracking the deeper
but less visible roots from which real lack of self-esteem arises.

<P>The false approach that views each person as literally a law unto
him or herself (auto-nomos = self law) cannot be the basis of a society of
responsibly inter-related citizens.  A more flourishing sense of civil
society urges us to reach beyond the pale and emaciated visions of
personhood that underlie so many educational insecurities today.

<P>In the current British Columbia Ministry of Education's Grades 8 -
12 programme entitled "Career and Personal Planning," it is made clear that
only "experts" ought to give any training in first aid.  Yet, what
expertise does the average teacher have to ground students in moral
responsibilities, true freedom and the arguments in favour of a robust
sense of citizenship?  Dr. Gow's paper joins an increasing chorus of
critics who suggest that the current focus on "self-esteem" is not only
foolish and insufficient, but it is also tragic and, as Maritain pointed
out long ago, poses a genuine threat  to the common good.

<P>The content of "framework for values" lists put out by current
Ministries of Education, which students are encouraged to add to and then
rank-order, shows the confusion of contemporary models when they are placed
alongside any usual list of "virtues" in the tradition.  How can anyone
think that a student's self-selection of such "values" as "physical
attractiveness" or "an adventuresome life" or "achieving something special"
could be of any real guidance to a student (these examples come from
British Columbia's current manual for Suggested Classroom Activities for
its Career and Personal Planning 8 - 12 Programme)?   Gone is any sense
that the relationship of moral choices to happiness needs to be pursued
with some rigour and structure.  In fact, in the "alert" accompanying the
"values" exercise, teachers are told that "Judging values is not
appropriate."  Yet the teacher is told that it is appropriate to "model the
process" of value discussion using themselves as examples.  The example
given is interesting:  "I am the oldest of seven children in a step-family.
Both of my parents worked and I had to work part-time.  I believe that
hard work and effort is very important and helps you to value your leisure
time."  Leisure time is no goal unless one is given insights into how to
spend such time usefully (here one might recall that Josef Pieper devoted
an entire book to the nature of  leisure as the basis of culture!).  Even
the lesson plans are inconsistent with their avowed goal to not judge
"values."  What is the point of exchanging any and every version of  "what
matters to me" unless it is to improve the lot of students?

<P>Important matters are not best served by a stance of neutrality
(even assuming such a stance is possible - which it is not).   In such a
setting the banal, trivial, or bizarre are placed on par with the noble and
the worthwhile, and one is expressly directed not to make the distinctions
that are, in fact, the essence of education itself.  Faced with this
approach, how could students even learn what they should be tolerant and
intolerant about - and why should "rights" matter (they are referred to as
important to the "empowerment" that the manual sees as an antidote to
"victimization")?  These examples of confusion give some indication of how
major a change is necessary and how difficult it will be to re-introduce a
moral vision into education.  But it must be re-introduced and the Centre
will do what it can to assist this endeavor through a host of future
activities that will examine what is missing from current models and what
might usefully be employed by way of corrective.  It is hoped that readers
will find Dr. Gow's paper an encouraging nudge in this  direction.

<H2>A tree without roots cannot stand</H2>



<H3>Some aspects of a problem at the root of Canadian society and what the

Centre proposes to do about it.</H3>



<P><I>Iain T. Benson<BR>

Senior Research Fellow, Centre for Renewal in Public Policy, Ottawa</I></P>



<P>In his recently published Massey Lectures, the Canadian philosopher Charles

Taylor writes about "The Malaise of Modernity".  To suffer a malaise is to

be uncomfortable and indicators in many areas point to wide-spread

uneasiness in Canadian society.  We were not educated in the tradition of

the virtues and, consequently, have a more or less fragmentary sense of

what the good is on the personal or social level.  A shift of this

magnitude has had and continues to have massive consequences in society

affecting every aspect of our lives.  To take one example, courts have

recently accepted a "community standards" test as the basis for determining

whether pornography is obscene under the Criminal Code.  Unless the

standard is itself connected to a meaningful moral framework, this seems to

decide what way the ship should go by following the direction in which the

bow is pointing: not a recommended form of navigation.</P>



<P>In every discipline, every area of life, people continue to function in

their day to day work and in their families according to principles that

have their roots in our philosophical and theological traditions.  Yet, at

the same time, an increasing number (or an increasing number of those in positions of influence) claim that these principles are merely veils for power or are based on outmoded

or incorrect notions.  Such people then select principles that appeal to them and give no

reasoned basis for choosing certain standards from traditional morality while rejecting others.  This is the impasse of modernity.</P>



<P>And all the while Royal Commissions on this or that key subject continue to

churn out Reports and Studies; judges pronounce their decisions on this or

that important aspect of the law; academics produce their books and

articles on important questions; doctors continue to examine and prescribe for their patients or

do research often involving complicated ethical issues, teachers continue to teach their students, and parliamentarians continue to debate the latest legislative initiatives.  But in every area those who know that we must ask whether what we are doing is good, are deeply distressed and those who believe goodness to be a question of purely personal "values" confirm the criticisms of the first group.  Confusion reigns at the highest levels but

daily life must and does go on and it may be years before the gnawing void at the centre of things leads to a visible collapse.  At  least that is so, for now, here in Canada.  It is not so elsewhere.</P>



<P>At other times, as today in other places, what were once "civilized"

cultures, not too dissimilar to ours, tear themselves apart, enslaving or eradicating

themselves and others in the process.  For the truth is that human beings have not

developed beyond the possibility of becoming bestial.  Compassion,

self-sacrifice and peaceful co-habitation, as aspects of a true humanity,

are willed states of being that are chosen by people on the basis of their

understanding of themselves and their beliefs.  But such choosing must be

informed and, until the erosion over recent centuries, information on the

precise nature of goodness was part of education and teaching about virtue

was seen as necessary preparation for a virtuous life and virtue was

understood as related to happiness.</P>



<P>Here in Canada, the increasing lack of teaching about morality and virtue in our education systems at all levels and its blossoming in every facet of life, is masked in the midst of a

more-or-less cohesive society.  But such chaos of thought is only hidden

and remains there like an undetected tumor, growing and active, but

ultimately, destructive.  Such an uneasy cultural peace must be replaced by

a deep and lasting peace based on people being taught what goodness is

grounded upon and subsists in.  What makes for coherence is that we share

in,and pursue, things that are good.  But the very idea of goodness is

disappearing because it is first doubted, then ignored.  Once what is good

is no longer taught, it becomes, on one level, forgotten, but because

goodness is a reality, its many faces continue to appear in our lives,

puzzling, reminding and tantalizing.</P>



<P>A related issue to this is that the centuries have seen a more-or-less

unbridled development of technology at a time when

education about purpose and the relationship between disciplines has been

in steadily decline.  As we have become increasingly adept at development,

we have become increasingly unable to apply technology in ways that are

non-destructive.  What comes heralded as bringing new joy and hope can soon

come to destroy and alienate.  Thus, introduction of a "labour saving

device" can result in reducing the number of labourers, destroying

community and family life, harming the environment and increasing the pace

of production and human life to an insupportable and unhealthy level.  Though labour may have been saved at the outset, leisure and the quality of life in the fullest sense have

decreased despite all the undoubted technological advancement.  We would be

wise to listen to the older people amongst us, who frequently speak about

the decrease in the quality of life they see around them.  When the ability

to do a thing technologically does not call for a deep analysis of whether

and how it should be done, we risk allowing technique to eradicate or deform purpose.</P>



<P>At this time it is clear that there is a need for fundamental reevaluation

of presuppositions.  This must be done by realizing what has gone wrong.

Then we can articulate purposes and recognize that a focus on the means of

techniques is inefficient and dangerous.  So, no matter what the

discipline, there needs to be a rethinking of foundations.  It is this work

of integration and education that the Centre has been established to

encourage.  Part of the Centre's function will be, through its Research

Board, publications and the holding of conferences, to analyze current

errors and abandonments and to rediscover and represent what has been

unjustifiably ignored. By the provision of papers and educational materials and the holding of forums, the Centre will provide an opportunity to people in the divided worlds of their disciplines to work together to assist a society deeply alienated from its purposes.  When such

a separation occurs on the level of disciplines, it is not surprising that we see a similar alienation on the personal level.  When a person sees no purpose for his or her life, it is a purpose and not a technique that is needed to fill this void.  The Centre's work then has both a social and a deeply personal aspect.  We hope that you will be a part of this work of rediscovery and renewal and will help support the Centre in this critical task.  To start, the publications (discussion papers, a newsletter and, eventually, a peer-reviewed Journal), set up the Research Board and begin our work, we need your support.

<H2>Assisted Dying:</H2>


<P><I>Iain T. Benson</I>



<P>The Latimer Verdict and Oregon's "Assistance in Dying" Law

Recently the debate surrounding death by choice has heated up.  Everyone is

talking and writing about the sentencing of Robert Latimer for killing his

cerebral palsied daughter on their Saskatchewan family farm.  in Oregon,

pro-euthanasia forces are celebrating the first law of its type in the

world, a law that will allow doctors to prescribe drugs they know are to be

used to bring about the death of the patient rather than to relieve the

patient's pain.</P>



<P>When people can kill for what they think are good motives, when doctors can

prescribe death rather than the alleviation of pain, they we have moved to

another kind of society altogether.  The concern of those who do not want

to be kept alive too long by artificial means is legitimate.  We do have to

learn that death is a natural part of life and modern medicine has been so

captivated by technology that it has sometimes lost sight of this fact.

Those who are afraid of dying in extreme pain need not have that fear as

any good palliative physician could tell them.  The fear of pain and of

being kept alive for too long are the fears that are being played upon by

the pro-euthanasia forces.  They (with the help of their friends in the

media) are manipulating the public.</P>



<P>In 1994 a Select Committee of the House of Lords, after an exhaustive

review, issued a Report<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> which set out why they chose not to change their

laws to allow euthanasia or assisted-suicide.  The Committee's Report

stated that ". . . we do not think it possible to set secure limits on

voluntary euthanasia".  The members of this Committee, who rigorously

examined the Netherlands system, found that "it would be next to impossible

to ensure that all acts of euthanasia were truly voluntary, and that any

liberalization of the law was not abused", moreover, " . . . vulnerable

people - the elderly, lonely, sick or distressed - would feel pressure, whether real or imagined, to request

early death".  Even Derek Humphry of the Hemlock Society has admitted that

he knows that mistakes will occur in the working out of the Oregon

legislation.</P>



<P>In light of the emotional appeal of the Latimer case, and Oregon's recent

(and we hope, temporary) flirtation with the fringes of assisted suicide,

the conclusion of the Lords' Committee should be heard more widely across

North America:</P>



<P><I>"Ultimately however, we do not believe that these (pro-euthanasia and

assisted suicide) arguments are sufficient reason to weaken society's

prohibition of intentional killing.  That prohibition is the cornerstone of

law and of social relationships.  It protects each one of us impartially,

embodying the belief that all are equal.  We do not with that protection to

be diminished and we therefore recommend that there should be no change in

the law to permit euthanasia.  We acknowledge that there are individual

cases in which euthanasia may be seen by some to be appropriate.  But

individual cases cannot reasonably establish the foundation of a policy

which would have such serious and widespread repercussions.  Moreover,

dying is not only a personal or individual affair.  The death of a person

affects the lives of others, often in ways and to an extent which cannot be

foreseen.  We believe that the issue of euthanasia is one in which the

interest of the individual cannot be separated from the interest of society

as a whole."</I>  <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A></P>



<P>The jury came to the right conclusion in the Latimer case.  If there are

any lessons to be learned from that case they are in relation to why the

support for the family was not there or why the Latimer's chose not to

avail themselves of it (the way Sue Rodrigues refused to use the palliative

care that was offered to her).  If the law needs changing, it would be only

to provide greater flexibility in sentencing for second degree murder.  It

must not be as some suggest, a "third degree" murder charge).  For as the

Netherlands experience has shown, open that door of "mercy killing"

(Latimer) or "assistance in dying" (Oregon) and virtually anything can pass

through it no matter how carefully any "safeguards" are framed.  The hard

cases are always used to manipulate soft thought and it is for this reason

that it is said that "hard cases make bad law".</P>

<H2>Why the Centre is not "RIGHT" or "LEFT"</H2>

<P><I>Iain T. Benson</I></P>

<P>Someone phoned recently worried that the Centre would be "pigeon-holed" if

it expressed certain opinions.  When asked how, the caller said, "Oh, you

know, as another right-wing Christian group".  The assumption seemed to be

that any group seeking to inform policy discussions with the riches of the

Jewish and Christian traditions would necessarily be "right wing".  The

words "Christian" and "right wing" seem to be found conveniently close to

one another in many articles in current journals and daily newspapers.

Perhaps the oft-mentioned "religious right" of the United States is the

boogey-person that looms in such people's imagination.  Without getting too

far into whether there is any useful meaning to the terms "left" and

"right" today, it is timely to reflect on the danger posed to analysis by

pigeon-holing.  Such pigeon-holing stands in for analysis more often than

not.  Many journalists seem unable to deal at all with an issue until they

can classify those who made the statements (on gender, class, race or

religious grounds) rather than deal with the statements  themselves.</P>



<P>The Centre's approach will be predictable in only one way:  it will be

sympathetic to the Judaeo-Christian    tradition which has been the matrix

of Western civilization.  All the Centre's members have a commitment to

this  tradition and believe that it is relevant to contemporary discussion

at every level.  The Centre will on occasion express a view that some would

consider "right wing", just as, from time to time it will express what some

would consider a "left wing" view.   The Centre might issue position

papers, but more often we will issue discussion papers, or host forums and

so forth.  Individual members of the Centre will speak their own minds in

ways that should foster deeper analysis than usual.<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>   Our members will

speak about the importance of the Judaeo-Christian positions, as they

understand them, in connection with their own area(s) of expertise.  So

far, debates (and those who cover them here) allow little room for this

perspective.</P>



<P>The real problems with the "right" or "left" classification, and the

tendency to assume that religion means "right", are superficiality and

inaccuracy.  It is enough to say of someone that "Of course, she is, you

know, an N.D.P.'er" as if that is sufficient to describe her in all or even

in relevant respects.  Note how, in this example, the woman herself

disappears into whatever is meant by an "N.D.P.'er" regardless of the

position she holds on a particular issue.  So, too, with assuming that

Christian means "right wing".  This "party politics" way of looking at the

world is not the most fruitful way to deal with either people or issues.</P>



<P>At the moment Canadian society is knee-deep in superficial stereotyping.

Gender, race, political party, socio-economic class, all are used as an

excuse to label and, therefore, to dismiss the position put forward.</P>



<P>The Centre for Renewal in Public Policy will embody the principle of

"issue by issue" analysis.  Even if those involved in the Centre were to

support a particular party (which they do not), the Centre would not

endorse particular political parties.  That is not our role.  Our analysis

will be of issues rather than people and of principles rather than

parties.   If this rule were put into  practice by Canadian politicians and

journalists, they would command greater respect than they currently do.</P>



<P>All of us, including the journalists and politicians themselves, need to

foster deeper analysis and more meaningful dialogue.  We hope that by

linking disciplines and focusing on purposes as well as techniques,

the Centre will be of assistance in this effort.  There is no "quick fix"

for the serious problems that face Western democracies today, but we hope

that over time the quality of discussion will improve.   We look forward to

your comments with respect to anything the Centre produces.</P>



<H4>Iain Benson is the Centre's Senior Research Fellow and senior editor of the

Centre's publications.  He would like to thank Dr. Paul Nathanson of

Montreal for his editrorial assistance on both of his articles in this

issue.<BR></H4>



<A NAME=1><P><SUP>1</SUP>  Determining what the relevant questions are, and how best to pose them,

would itself be an important contribution to public policy formulation.  Failure to ask relevant questions ensures subsequent errors.</P>

<H2>Surrogate Motherhood and Its Human Costs</H2>


<P><I>Suzanne Rozell Scorsone, Ph.D.</I></P>


<P>The increasing legal and moral dilemma of "surrogate motherhood" requires

our society to consider its serious implications, and provide government

and others an opportunity to act so that practices which threaten the

priceless value of human life are not further encouraged in Canadian

society.</P>



<P>The discussion of so-called "surrogate motherhood" has been in Canada for

nearly a decade and a half.  The term has been used in at least two senses.

It may be used for arrangements in which the sperm of the male half of a

contracting couple is utilized to fertilize the ovum of a contracted woman,

who is paid to surrender custody of the child to him and to his wife at

birth.  The term " surrogate", in this sort of case, is actually a

misnomer.  A "surrogate" is a "delegate" or "proxy", whereas the contracted

woman is, in fact, the genetic, biological mother of the child, and

surrogate to no one.  A newer form, gestational surrogacy, uses in vitro

fertilization to implant an embryo conceived from the ovum and sperm of the

contracting couple in a woman who carries and nourishes a child who is not

genetically related to her, surrendering the baby to the contracting

parents at birth.</P>



<P>Both forms, where they exist, are usually arranged by brokers, generally

lawyers, and by physicians who carry out the donor insemination or IVF

which brings about the pregnancy.  It is worth noting that the payments to

brokers and physicians for a few hours work tend roughly to equal or even

exceed those to the contracted women for nine months and more, 24 hours per

day.  The remuneration per hour, if calculated, is a silent but eloquent

comment on the value placed on each of them and on what they do.  There are

instances, perhaps involving relatives or friends, which have not involved

payment but in the vast majority of cases the arrangement would not have

taken place without it.  The Royal Commission on New Reproductive

Technologies coined a new term, "preconception arrangement", to cover all

forms of surrogacy.</P>



<P>The Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies found no evidence

that any of 27 surveyed fertility clinics across Canada was involved in

facilitating preconception arrangements at that time, although one was

making plans to begin.<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>  There is, however, anecdotal evidence that a small

number of Canadians have made use of such services in other countries such

as the United States.  They may also be doing so unreported in physicians'

private offices or in arrangements facilitated by lawyers but utilizing

sperm collected and transferred by very informal, low-tech means without

recourse to a physician.  It is now, before the practice becomes widespread

or vested interests become established, that public discussion at all

levels should occur and, on the basis of which, the government of Canada

would be able to act in the window of opportunity that currently exists.</P>



<P>Yet in Canada the legal status of the practice is as unclear now as it was

in the early 1980's.  Only in Quebec has legislation been passed.  Section

541 of the revised Civil Code renders all agreements for procreation or

gestation for payment null and void.<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>  It may be that provisions in the

family, contract and other forms of law of various Provinces and

Territories would have implications for preconception arrangements, but

since none has come before a court the status of the question is altogether

murky.</P>



<P>For example, payment for adoption is, as the Royal Commission points out,

prohibited in Ontario.  This could well cause a court to find some forms of

surrogacy impermissible.  Yet one may also point out that the contracting

man who is the source of sperm is the genetic father of the child.  In

Ontario the category "illegitimate" has no legal existence.  If the

"surrogate" is the genetic mother of the child, and if she acknowledges his

paternity of the child, in Ontario the child is legally also his child.

Only if he were married and the contracting wife wished to adopt the child

would prohibitions against adoption clearly apply.  Adoption by the

contracting wife has, indeed, been the most common scenario.  Yet, if the

contracting man were single, or if he were a married man and his wife

accepted having only a fostering or, as it were, stepmother status toward

the child, any payment made to the genetic mother for surrender of her

parental custodial rights to him would very possibly fall into a legal

void.  Then again, if the contracting couple were the source of both ovum

and sperm, the surrogate supplying only gestation, then whether laws with

respect to payment for adoption had any applicability would again be

uncertain.  This would depend on whether the genetic relationship or the

act of birth were deemed by a court to determine who was the mother of the

child, the contracting woman or the"surrogate".  Where, as in a California

decision, the contracted women were deemed to be a "generic stranger" to

the child, the contracting woman and man would be declared parents.<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>  Laws prohibiting payment for adoption would have no bearing at all on the case.</P>



<P>Another among the many strong arguments presented by the Royal Commission

points to a fundamental principle of family law, the priority of the best

interests of the child, which could render preconception arrangements

contracts unenforceable.  The argument would be that any contract formed

before a conception would have been made in the interests of the adults,

not in the interest of a child whose interests would be unknowable until he or she is

born.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>  Logically persuasive as this argument is, unfortunately it may not

settle the question for a court presented with a concrete human situation.

Research has shown that most contracting couples are relatively

highly educated and affluent, while most "surrogate mothers" are of modest

or, more often, downright slender educational and financial means.  Not to

put too fine a point on it, they enter upon surrogacy contracts because

they are presented with a source of money, they have relatively few

alternative opportunities, and they do not have the skills to earn a higher

income in some other way.  Contracting couples have the capacity to offer a

child educational and other advantages contracted women cannot (not to speak of the resources to hire a top-flight lawyer to beat a contracted woman in court).  As we saw in the "Baby M" case in the United States, even if a court affirms the parental identity and

rights of a genetically-linked surrogate, the financial and other resources

of a contracting couple may be so much greater that the court may

nonetheless award custody to them - in the pragmatically-assessed best

interests of the child once born.</P>



<P>Infertility is a grievous thing.  Those who would consider seeking a

surrogate to bear them a child must feel driven by a great and painful

need.  We can - we must - feel with them.  Too much harm, however, although

it is doubtless unintended, can come from this practice for society to

accept it as a way of dealing with the painful reality of infertility.

We on the Royal Commission agreed unanimously that preconception

arrangements are unacceptable.  Preconception arrangements exploit the

generative capacity of the mother, a fundamental and inalienable aspect of

her humanity, taking advantage of her economic vulnerability.  They dehumanize women by objectivizing the reproductive capacity which characterizes them as women.  In the vast

majority of instances preconception arrangements commercialize

reproduction, the coming into being of human life.  They make the child

himself or herself virtually an object of commerce.  Even where they are

not commercial, preconception arrangements may be the subject of subtle or overt forms of

coercion and pressure, as when one family member may feel obligated to

provide this "service" for another.  Whatever the claims to apparent autonomy of the adult individuals entering into such a contract, the effect on the child cannot help but have a great cost in a ruptured relationship with the generic mother.  In the psychological aftermath of

having been "sold", where this has occurred, and even in pressure of live

up to "the price".  As great and important as the desire for a child

unquestionably is, a good end does not justify means which bear such human

costs.</P>



<P>Still other reasons, not raised in our report, also come readily in mind.

Preconception arrangements wrongfully appear to define one of the most

intimate and fundamental of human relationships, that between parent and

child, as an impersonal contract which can be severed at will for

compensation.  Adoption does not provide a valid precedent.  Adoption does

sever that bond and reassign custody, but it does so in the best interests

of an already-existing child under difficult or even tragic circumstances.

It is no precedent for the deliberate creation of an impersonal, commercial

contract to sever the parent-child bond from the very outset before any

child has even been conceived.</P>



<P>The Royal Commission recommended that the federal government prohibit acting as an intermediary, advertising, being paid for acting as an intermediary, or making a payment

for a preconception arrangement, under threat of criminal sanction.</P>



<P>Such legislation would present negligible cost to government.  It involves no structures,

programmes or expenditures.  It requires only legislation and normal enforcement.  Even were it the only governmental action taken, it would come close to ending a practice in which almost no suppliers, whether contracted women, brokers or physicians, would engage without the

monetary incentive.</P>



<P>The final report of the Royal Commission was submitted on 15 November 1993.

Since that time government has been examining the evidence and the arguments on this and many other issues.  Of all the complex questions arising out of the field of reproductive

technologies, however, this among the simplest to resolve.</P>



<P>The numbers involved are small, but the human stakes are very high.  If

children and the parent-child bond can be redefined as commodities, and if

parenthood itself can be redefined as a contractual service which can be

transferred for compensation, ultimately it touches all of us.<BR></P>

Article #1</H1></CENTER>

<H2>The meaning of "RENEWAL"</H2>

<P>On several occasions, those speaking on behalf of the Centre have been

asked about the meaning of the word "renewal" in our title.  Of the various

definitions of "renewal," perhaps the one that best describes what we mean

is this: "to revive, reawaken, resuscitate" and "to bring back into use or

existence."  For the truth is, our society has ignored or forgotten some

things that are essential to our common life.  The term is used in a

positive way, therefore, to signify both hope and expectation.  The hope is

that our current cultural and public-policy situation is not beyond change

or improvement; the expectation is that with conviction, effort, and wide

spread support, our efforts will play a part in assisting such improvement.</P>



<P>What needs to be renewed?  For many years now, there has been, at every

level of society, a growing gap between the techniques of disciplines and

the purposes of  disciplines.  We have been learning how to do particular

things, in other words, but not what they are for.   This separation has

occurred in every area, whether it is law, medicine, politics, or education

itself.  We have stopped asking the big questions: in law, what do we mean

by justice and the common good?;  in education, what is the purpose and

moral content of education?; in medicine, what is the meaning of "health";

and, in politics, which matters are appropriate for government

intervention, and which  are  not?  All the while, the  technical focus of

each  discipline  has continued.  The vacuum becomes noticeable in any area

when a fundamental articulation is required in order to deal with an issue.</P>



<P>For example, to take an important question in the political realm, how

should parliamentarians deal with their public offices in relation to their

private beliefs?   In the legal area, what is the relation between law and

morals when it has to be decided whether a Criminal Code definition of

"obscenity" is challenged in light of the Charter's guaranteed "freedom of

expression"?   The way these questions are being handled at the highest

levels of Canadian society is an indication that something of grave

significance has already gone wrong<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>.</P>



<P>Canadian public policy necessarily reflects the insight of its framers -

or their lack of it.  Indications are that major institutions are finding

it increasingly difficult to articulate their purposes or on what their

"ought" propositions are based.  Thus, we are treated to the spectacle of a

Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies rejecting the views of

most Canadians in favour of "Charter values" with respect to one issue<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>,

but the Supreme Court of Canada interpreting the Charter according to the

wishes of the community by accepting a "community standards" test as a

valid way to determine what should be considered obscene on another<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>.</P>



<P>Where "Charter values" are used in diametrically opposite ways, the

Charter can be used to justify virtually any outcome.  The Charter of

Rights cannot long be maintained as a meaningful document in a society that

no longer knows what is fundamental and for what reasons.  Attempts to

maintain the form of democracy without its substance (which includes, among

other things, representation and accountability) are doomed to fail over

time.</P>



<P>The rise of a functional chaos<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> was predictable given that, for some time,

the prevailing system of schooling has not prepared us to deal with the

problems that face us as a country.  As a result, political debates have an

air of unreality about them, and laws are increasingly seen as emanating

from the politics of power rather than from any coherent understanding of

the person or the common good.  The Charter of Rights refers to

"fundamental rights and freedoms".  But what does "fundamental" mean?   It

is not surprising, therefore, that decisions are increasingly incoherent.</P>



<P>These fundamental rights and freedoms were not created yesterday.  They

emerged in a tradition. Its particular vision of human beings depends on

certain theological and philosophical notions that are not less valid

because they are now, in a sense, less "visible".  As C.S.Lewis once put it

on the first page of The Allegory of Love:</P>



<P><I>Humanity does not pass through phases as a train passes through stations:

being alive, it has the privilege of always moving yet never leaving anything behind.  Whatever we have been, in some sort we are still.</I></P>



<P>The current intellectual vacuum does not augur well for Canada's future.

Many  are   already concerned that key concepts (such as virtue and what a

developed character consists of)  have  to  be relearned (re-membered) so

that they can be promoted through public education.  Pluralism and nihilism

are not the same thing, and it is important to give meaning to the term

"pluralism" if nihilism is not to be the outcome of our current "value

neutral" endeavor.<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A></P>



<P>The Centre is pledged to assist in the work of re-articulation and renewal

for current and future needs.  We    cannot afford to be "chronological

snobs" who think today is necessarily better than yesterday.  Our task is

now, as it always ought to have been, to keep alive and to cherish those

truths that are essential to the maintenance and enjoyment of a flourishing

culture.  Those truths that the Charter speaks of as "fundamental" are part

of this culture.   How can we complain about the way people act when we

have ceased to teach them anything about morality?</P>



<P>It is not surprising that many highly schooled (but not morally educated)

members of the elite want to shy away from discussing morality.  This

highlights the seriousness of our current situation.  In Our Criminal Law

(1976) the Law Reform Commission of Canada pointed out that criminal law is

"fundamentally a moral system...a system of applied morality" (at p. 16).

Ultimately, our duty to obey the law itself is grounded, in part, on our

recognition of the moral duty to do so.  It is sobering to consider this

fact in light of contemporary crime statistics (see Gertrude Himmelfarb's

The De-moralization of Society [New York: Knopf, 1995]).<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>  The Centre is

in the process of preparing Canadian statistics to see whether Himmelfarb's

graphic analysis is paralleled in Canada; we will be surprised if it

is not.  Ageless truths need to be cherished and transmitted by each

generation.  If that truth is lost, then it must be rediscovered and

renewed.<BR></P>

<H2>Reflections on the Media</H2>


<P><I>Phil Marchand</I>


<P>The media, both print and electronic, needs to be recognized for the

visceral art form that it is, and at best encountered with extreme prudence

by those who wish to be deeply informed as opposed to (or as well as)

entertained.</P>



<P>T.SE. Eliot once said he never read newspapers because they were too

exciting.  He was not being ironic, or referring merely to racy tabloids.

He was noticing a reality which most of us are too jaded or numb, by now,

to appreciate.  Newspapers of their nature - even the more sober variety,

such as the New York Times - intend to arouse, or excite, their readers.

Every editorial decision - involving lay-out, choice of art, phrasing of headlines and

captions, and of course, the editing and writing of articles, especially in

regard to lead paragraphs - in calculated to further that aim.</P>



<P>There is no use in expressing moral indignation at this state of affairs,

or bemoaning the "sensationalistic" or "superficial" press.  The electronic

media is, of course, even more attuned to the visceral and the shocking,

and adept at grabbing viewers' attention while numbing their rational

faculties.  Neither newspapers nor television and radio has much place for

sustained, reasoned argument.  This is not to say that newspapers don't run

good op-ed pieces on occasion, or convey useful information, but

institutions or groups with an interest in taking advantage of the media to

convey their views had better start with this reality in mind.</P>



<P>The media loves drama, and, of course, the essence of drama is conflict.

If there is an easily identifiable hero and villain involved in the

conflict, so much the better.  Failing that, any startling action or

statement - particularly pratfalls and gaffes on the part of the eminent - is meat and

drink to the media, both print and electronic.</P>



<P>Individuals and groups often complain that the media focus on such matters

at the expense of "substantive" issues.  We are made to feel guilty, for

example, about our media-induced fascination with O.J. Simpson.  An

argument can be made, however, that our guilty fascination - well

understood by the media - are an essential part of our

common humanity.  The O.J. Simpson story, after all, is about passion and

justice.  Why should we not be interested in it?  Personally, I would much

rather read accounts of O.J. Simpson's trial than all the political

commentary that's bound to precede the Quebec referendum.</P>



<P>Moreover, print reporters at their best, like good novelists, have an eye

for the telling detail that reveals more about a person or event than

official statements and press releases.  The off the cuff remarks, dress,

and casual behaviour of a politician, for example, might be considered

irrelevant by many people, but certainly not by Dickens or Flaubert.  They would see such

things as vital clues to character - and most readers, whether they thought about it

or not, would  agree.</P>



<P>Certainly it is frustrating for individuals and groups who have a message

to convey to find that message thwarted by the reporting of the media.  I

don't think the Writers' Union of Canada, for example, is too pleased with

my reporting of its annual meetings.  Doubtless, the union would rather

have its highly important resolutions on funding of the arts publicized,

but I have tended to focus on nasty shouting matches over issues such as

racial minority writers' conferences - partly because I believe such

unpleasant incidents truly are more significant than the union's

resolutions.  They illuminate the kind of issues that actually move people.</P>



<P>The political bias of the reporter has less to do with these matters than

is generally realized.  I recall a feminist conference that took place in Alberta some

years ago, in which an invited speaker, Andrea Dworkin, made some

outrageous comments about women taking vigilante action against rapists, or

some such offenders.  In most reports, those remarks were headlined.</P>



<P>Moreover, a woman reporter for the Edmonton Journal, I believe, ignored the

remarks or placed them near the bottom of her story.  When questions as to

her judgement in so doing, she replied that she felt the work of the conference

was the real story.  It was "important."  In other words, she completely

bought the agenda of the conference organizers.  If she had been

covering a conference of Progressive Conservatives, or Reform Party

delegates, or some other group she detested, and someone made a racist

joke, guess what would have been featured in her lead paragraph?</P>



<P>This incident is notable, however, because it is uncommon.  Most reporters

know what their editors and readers find interesting, and that's what they

report, even if they don't like it.</P>



<P>Given this reality, those having to deal with the media should think of it

as an art form, not a bulletin board or loudspeaker or conveyor belt for

messages.  Like all art forms it deals not in intellectual propositions but

in impressions calculated to produce an effect on an audience.  If a group

wants to exploit this art form, it had better think very carefully about

such impressions, and how they can be produced.  It had better think, in

short, like an artist - or an advertiser or a propagandist.  In short, people should

recognize what the media, as it is currently constituted, can and cannot

do.  If learned analysis is sought in the vast majority of cases groups

must look elsewhere than the popular media.</P>



<P>From a Christian perspective, however, it might well appear that all such

effort is wasted.  I have often reflected that individuals who find

themselves talking to reporters should remember a few simple rules, mostly

negative in character.  Never give your enemies free publicity is one such

rule, for example.  (If Archbishop Ambrozic had remembered this rule in an

interview he gave last year to Toronto Life magazine, in which he slammed a

left winged Catholic activist, he would have saved himself much grief.)

But these rules are a matter, largely, of common sense - trying to go

further in the matter media savvy, in an attempt to manipulate the media,

is probably a fool's game.</P>



<P>Ultimately nothing can take the place of rigorous thought and argument, which is

not what the media is looking for.  And of course no medium of communication ever conceived is as potent, on this unhappy earth, as prayer.<BR></P>

<H2>Religious Morality and Public Policy</H2>

<P><I>John Redekop<BR>
Professor of Political Science (on leave), Wilfred Laurier University<BR>
Research Scholar in Residence, Trinity Western University</I></P>

<P>Was Reinhold Niebuhr correct when he asserted that "Democracy is that child
of which Christianity need never be ashamed"?  Given centuries of
intolerance and religious wars, often involving "Christian" societies, can
one really claim that not only are Christianity
and democracy compatible, but that Christianity actually promotes the
democratic tradition?</P>

<P>The major religions of the world were all enunciated initially as creeds
by which people should live.  Moses, the prophet Mohammed, and Jesus Christ
- to name three enunciators - all spelled out moral codes intended to
restrain evil, to reward goodness, to facilitate distinguishing between the
two, and to encourage that which is good.  For centuries various countries
have sought to establish legal codes which incorporated these religious
moral codes.  Often, in their crusading and ideological zeal, true
believers set aside toleration and free choice and ended up with brutal
realities such as the Spanish inquisition, the Cromwellian dictatorship, or
the Islamic persecution of religious dissidents as in modern Iran and
Pakistan.</P>

<P>The question to be investigated in this essay is whether the
Judeo-Christian ethic, the behavioural component of these two faith-based
world views, is not only a pragmatically desirable ethic for adherents to
follow but can also serve as a very useful guideline in the formation of
public policy in a religiously plural society such as Canada (even though
the two faiths espouse different creeds, they have sufficiently common
ethic to allow us to speak of a single hyphenated entity).  Whether other
faiths could also serve as an ethical foundation for a religiously plural
democracy deserves analysis in its own right.</P>

<P>In the Canadian case, of course, well over 80 percent of the population
identifies with the Judeo-Christian world view and thus most Canadians have
a predisposition to accept the ethic as generally valid.  But this fact
does not, in itself, provide any justification for having public policy
shaped by Judeo-Christian principles.  For that we must evaluate the
overall utility of the Judeo-Christian ethic in developing a set of public
policies which will advance the good of all, while simultaneously sustaining
and promoting the democratic political system itself.</P>

<P>In seeking to ascertain whether the central principles of the
Judeo-Christian ethic provide the kind of soil in which the democratic
tradition will thrive, what arguments and evidence should we consider?  How
can we find out whether this world-view really can advance the social and
political well-being of all religious groups, and all non-believers, in
Canada, or elsewhere for that matter?  Let us spell out and assess four
fundamental assertions which lie at the heart of the Judeo-Christian
faiths.</P>

<P>First, these faiths strongly emphasize the worth and dignity of every
individual.  Every person is seen as being made in the image of God and
therefore possessing a spark of the divine.  Human beings, in this
perspective, are not seen as the highest form of animal evolution but as
the only creature which God made in his own image.</P>

<P>We encounter here the startling assertion that every individual,
possessing a God-breathed eternal soul, is worth more than the whole world.
Such an affirmation makes a person much more than a producer, a consumer,
a voter, a resident, a taxpayer, a party member, or a citizen with a S.I.N.
It imbues every individual, whether Judeo-Christian or not, with great
potential, profound worth, and eternal significance.  It comes as no
surprise then,
to discover that, generally speaking, states in Christendom have gone to
great lengths to guard the dignity and freedom of all people, to respect
their views, and to facilitate the development and
political participation of every person in the realm.</P>

<P>Second, the Judeo-Christian faiths stress the equal worth of all human
beings, from the youngest to the oldest, from all races, from all classes
and from both sexes.  This emphasis on equal worth, rooted in God's
commandments, reinforces the crucial democratic suppositions concerning
equality before the law, equality in voting power, and equality as objects
of government policy.</P>

<P>Third, the basic emphasis in these two faiths which holds that the
faithful are their "brother's keeper" generates both a social consciousness
and a sense of obligation concerning human rights.  The resulting social
consciousness goes a long way in explaining why Judeo-Christian societies
led the world in the provision of assistance to the poor, the ill, the
elderly, and the disadvantaged generally.  It probably also explains, in
part, why these same societies led the world in the pioneering of foreign
aid.  Such material aid, after all, becomes part of the God-decreed,
inclusive "missionary mandate".</P>

<P>Fourth, and most significant, we find in the Jewish and Christian faiths a
central assertion of voluntarism.  While Jews and Christians promote the
importance of discovering "God's truth", they also acknowledge the constant
option of rejecting "God's truth".  God has willed it thus.  Therein lies
the basis of freedom, of human choice and human responsibility.  In other
words, because of the requirement of voluntarism, the Jewish and Christian
faiths cannot be coerced.  Indeed, according to the Holy Scriptures of both
faiths, "coerced faith" constitutes a contradiction in terms.  External
behaviour can be coerced; internal beliefs cannot be coerced.  While some
misguided zealots, down through the ages, have attempted to force Christian
conversion, the religion itself, as also the Jewish faith, allows no place
for such activity.  These faiths recognize only a personal and voluntary
response, be it positive or negative, to God's message.</P>

<P>The vitally important political consequence of this emphasis on
voluntarism and choice can hardly be overstated.  It consists of a
commitment to fundamental freedom for all - for Jews, for Christians, for
believers in other faiths, and for those without belief in any faith.  For
theological reasons, Jews and Christians, when true to their creeds, grant
full religious freedom to all groups.</P>

<P>But the granting of this freedom, indeed, the insistence on it, also means
that Jews and Christians, when acting consistently, strongly support the
related freedoms - speech, assembly, privacy, political involvement, etc. -
without which religious freedom cannot exist.  Thus the logic of the
Judeo-Christian ethic, rooted in the central teaching of the faiths,
extends multifaceted freedom to all groups and does so up to the point at
which people seriously harm themselves, deny similar freedom to others, or
seek to destroy the very system which spells out and guarantees these basic
rights for all.</P>

<P>Thus it happens that the Judeo-Christian ethic insists on rights for
majorities as well as minorities and for groups as well as individuals.
When disputes occur, neither side shall be permitted to manipulate or suppress
the other.  Such an insistence on reasonable limits and restraints, applied
equally to all, does not weaken the basic commitment to freedom for all.
As Thomas Hobbes explained, more than three centuries ago, anarchy does not
constitute freedom.

<P>An insistence on freedom of religion for all does not, however, mean
insistence on the equality of all religions.  The mutually contradictory
claims of various faiths makes such an assertion illogical.  After all,  if
one faith asserts that Jesus was the Son of God and the other says that he
was not, they cannot both be true.  The resulting challenge for public
policy makers, at every governmental level, who hold to the Judeo-Christian
ethic, is to promote full freedom of religion and the acceptance of
religious pluralism while simultaneously, in the private and fully
voluntary sectors of their lives, affirming the uniqueness and presumed
superiority of the faith which they possess.  Such personal or
congregational faith nurturing and faith proclamation are done outside of
the arena of public policy, and without any specific assistance from the
arm of the law.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, throughout history we find examples of policy-makers who
claimed adherence to the Judeo-Christian ethic but did not hold to these
theologically-rooted principles.  They ignored, in political practice, the
perspective they generally continued to stress in their theological
statements, namely, that Jews and Christians uphold freedom because God
posits respect for free choice as central in his dealings with all
humankind.  When believers in the Judeo-Christian faiths neglect this
emphasis on free choice, they often become arrogant, intolerant, and even
vindictive.</P>

<P>The point warrants reinforcement, especially as it relates to
policy-makers.  Difficult as it may be, consistent believers in Judaism and
Christianity, even as they assert their own religious beliefs,
simultaneously insist on public policies which affirm toleration and which
grant full freedom for all other faith groups.  Moral choice is what God
gives them; moral choice is what they insist on for themselves and others.</P>

<P>Given the above, it seems reasonable to state that non-Christians can with
good conscience and integrity, accept and affirm the Judeo-Christian ethic
for its general utility - it serves them well.  Thus for example, the
Shiites, Sunnis and other Islamic groups would readily acknowledge that
they presently enjoy far greater religious and other freedoms in western
democracies such as Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, all
part of Christendom, than they enjoy in Iran and several other countries
which are part of the Muslim world.</P>

<P>It is also important to underscore the fact that public ethos and a
dominant faith are not synonymous.  Therefore, the Judeo-Christian ethic
can be dominant in a religiously plural society and can, for good reasons,
be supported by non-Judeo-Christian groups, without constituting any threat
to the free activity of minority faith groups.  Indeed, one could even
argue that the success of minority faiths would, in fact, be enhanced if
supporters of those faiths also supported public adherence to the
Judeo-Christian ethos with its insistence on freedom for all.</P>

<P>For Jews and Christians, the public policy challenge is two-fold.  These
believers, in public office and elsewhere, must promote freedom for all and
affirm the propriety of religious diversity.  Simultaneously, they must
strengthen their own faith communities and even seek to enlarge them, so
that the generally beneficial Judeo-Christian ethos will not be weakened or
lost.  In sum, Jews and Christians live out their faith, proclaim their
faith, and nurture their faith so that all people in society will benefit.</P>

<P>The legal scholar, John Warwick Montgomery, for years the Director of the
International Institute of Human Rights Summer School in Strasbourg,
France, has made some startling assertions.  In public lectures and in his
writings he has said that only Christianity can make a stand on human
rights that is more than an extension of a particular prejudice.  Outside
of the Judeo-Christian ethic it is difficult to find a catalogue of rights
which human beings should uphold on behalf of each other.  In this
connection we do well to remember that international human rights documents
such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed by the
General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948, were built on this ethic.</P>

<P>This academic, with eight earned degrees, author of more than one hundred
articles and of Human Rights and Human Dignity  and History and
Christianity, has written that a Christian "will ...condemn without
partiality violations of human rights whenever they occur and without
regard to the politics of the violators;  and he will strive to promote and
protect the dignity of every man without fear or favor." <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></P>

<P>Given our review of the Judeo-Christian ethic, can we concur with
Montgomery's assertion?  Can we further concur with the notion that careful
adherence to the authentic Judeo-Christian ethic, and protection of its key
principles, constitutes a sound guideline for decision-makers entrusted
with the development and enactment of public policy in our times?<BR></P>

<H2>Making a god of Self-Esteem:<BR>The Tyranny of Misdirected Sentiment</H2>
<I>By Kathleen M. Gow, Ph.D.</I>

<P>These days, taking issue with making a god of self-esteem probably places
one somewhere between Atilla the Hun and the early Desert Fathers.  But so
be it! Of course one is not against self-esteem, simply that the term has
become the virtual first principle, the major objective, the excuse for
much of what is being heralded as the sine qua non of progressive
education. In this there is confusion of well-intentioned sentiment with
directives which often serve to exacerbate the very problems they seek to
address.

<P>Clearly, we are appalled at the crushing costs
to youth which poverty, fractured family life, substance abuse, sexual and
emotional assault are exacting - erupting in violence and suicide. More
pervasively, sheer apathy of mind and spirit abound in many classrooms.
Diagnostic work-ups by mental health professionals whether individual or
collective in their focus, inevitably target "lack of self-esteem" as a key
dynamic driving these crises.  A California-based task force to promote
self-esteem in the U.S. went so far as to conclude that "lack of
self-esteem is central to most personal and social ills plaguing our state
and nation as we approach the end of the 20th Century." <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>   We want to
respond. Consequently, from broad-based Ministry of Education guidelines to
specific texts and course materials, "building self-esteem" has become a
consuming focus in the classroom.  The dictum is that students must feel
good about themselves, and too often this preempts the promotion of
academic  initiatives and diligence, and consistent standards of personal
discipline and responsibility.  This is where it is important to take
issue.  For most self-esteem curricula are rooted in little or no
foundational philosophic engagement with the nature of self or the nature
of esteem and therefore make little organic  connection between self-esteem
and questions of meaning or sense of purpose in life.

<P>But this reification of self at the centre is scarcely new.  Many
of us recognize it as essentially the gospel of moral relativism
exemplified in the Values Clarification approach to teaching moral
"values."  This approach has been firmly entrenched in elementary and
secondary school classrooms across North America since the late 1960's.
One Ontario study conducted among 10,000 teachers, 650 administrators, and
550 teacher-educators indicated that values clarification was by ten times
the most popular approach to teaching "values" education. <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> Self-esteem
curricula may sport different labels and packaging, the language may be
traded or modified, but essentially it claims the same preeminence for
individual license.  It parades under the aegis of tolerance and is
rationalized under the umbrella of pluralism.  Self at the centre of all
things.<BR><BR><BR>

<P><B>THE VALUES CLARIFICATION MOVEMENT</B>

<P>To recap briefly, the underlying philosophy of this approach holds that for
teachers to promote or support virtues such as honesty, justice, or
compassion, constitutes indoctrination of children and is a violation of
their moral freedom. It is argued that children - from kindergarten forward
- should be free to create and choose their own "values."  The teacher
"avoids moralizing, criticizing, giving values or evaluating.  The adult
excludes all hints of 'good' or 'right'  or  'acceptable' or their
opposites."<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>  If having gone through a seven-stage process of considering
the alternatives and the consequences, a child chooses, for example, to
value stealing or intolerance, his or her decision will not be challenged.
In this model, the chief criteria is that students go through a process of
clarifying their values and that they feel comfortable with whatever they
choose. It is the process that is all important, not the content.  Whatever
you choose will be right for you because you chose it.  In Values And
Teaching:  Working With Values In The Classroom, world promoters Raths,
Harmin and Simon specifically state:

<P><I>It is not impossible to conceive of someone going through the seven value
criteria and deciding that he values intolerance or thievery.  What is to
be done?  Our position is that we respect his right to decide upon that
value.</I><A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>

<P>Students are exempt from all traditional moral precepts or constraints.
Moral subjectivism is the only absolute - the intellect freed of moral
obligation.  Some educators have protested:

<P><I>This statement carries the ideal of individuality to the point where one
can no longer distinguish between the moral and the immoral.  Can an
educational theory produce a dishonest person and then merely say the
choice of dishonesty is a legitimate expression of individual preference?</I><A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>

<P>One of the reasons for the extensive adoption of the values
clarification approach, is that it purports to take a "neutral" position.
It holds that we live in a pluralistic society which embraces many
conflicting values and the best schools can do is take a neutral approach.
At first blush, this strikes a responsive note and many educators and
parents concur.  They are advised that to do otherwise could smack of
intolerance and even bigotry.  But the position that, for example, any view
regarding stealing, lying, cheating, murder, suicide <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> is as "right" as any
other, is not a neutral position.  It is just as much a dogma and doctrine
as any other stance, and as such can be equally authoritative and
indoctrinating.  So the prescription that a pluralistic society has no
choice but to support total moral relativism in its educational system is a
false association of ends and means, fact and "value."

<P>Elsewhere, one has dealt at some length with analysis of this
extremely influential movement.<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>  However, the above references indicate
something of the degree to which this educational model - well into its
second generation - discounts the search for true meaning/true self and
trades it off for "I will be or do whatever works for me at any given
moment".  This, then, has fed, legitimized and perpetuated the wide-spread
cult of self-esteem - the frenetic preoccupation with the necessity that we
must "feel good" about ourselves at any cost - even the cost of addictions
which assist us in maintaining the escape from real freedom.<BR><BR><BR>

<P><B>THE POLITICALLY CORRECT MOVEMENT</B>

<P>Significantly, into the midst of the free-fall individual utilitarianism of
the values clarification movement has exploded the so-called "politically
correct" movement of the 1990s.  It dictates that there is a "right" way to
think, feel, and act concerning a very wide range of behaviours and issues.
Were we ripe for such a movement?  Had we discovered that wide-open moral
relativism did not fulfil our expectations of autonomy and freedom, but
rather plunged us into more alienation and disconnectedness?  But
alienation and disconnectedness from what?  Or from whom? My self???  Was
this illusion of freedom just too confusing and too "heavy?"  In any case,
into the moral vacuum of values clarification burst political correctness -
yet another packaged solution to the question of self-identity.

<P>As in most movements, there are positive aspects to the politically
correct movement as, for example, the injunction that disparaging
references to colour, gender, race be lifted from public parlance and
printed materials, and that more inclusion of women's and multi-cultural
contributions to society should be fostered.  But to mention only one
extrapolation of that injunction, it is being heatedly argued in North
American universities that the Great Books from Plato, Aristotle, through
Shakespeare, etc. should be struck from course material on the grounds that
these books, written by men, automatically perpetuate a model of
male-dominated Western civilization and thereby reflect a skewed
interpretation of history.<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>  Again, foundational content critical to the
educated mind is pronounced irrelevant in deference to 'self-process' as
both means and end.

<P>Both the values clarification movement and the politically correct
movement are anti-intellectual, reductionist and prescriptive. Layered on
top of each other - or along side - they make for individual and collective
chaos.  In both movements, we witness the apparently unending hope and
expectation of human beings that they will find the "self" (self-esteem) in
the subjective freedoms of individual utilitarianism or in the "objective"
solidarity of a collective "cause."  To note a further commonality between
them, both these movements reflect the anti-historical position of the
post-modern era.  For the mind-set required for belief in the inevitability
of progress and scientific optimism requires strategic dissociation of the
so-called "modern" from the so-called "traditional."<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A><BR><BR><BR>

<P><B>TRADITIONALISTS AND PROGRESSIVES</B>

<P>In their compelling book, Bankrupt Education:  The Decline Of Liberal
Education In Canada, Peter Emberley and Waller Newell address this point:

<P><I>Increasingly, public debate is polarizing teachers and parents into camps,
and drawing battle lines between them, thus driving 'traditionalists' and
'progressives' into tight corners of polemic . . .  the first [camp], it is
said, wish to preserve the static, hierarchical, content-burdened
curriculum, while the latter focus on dynamic interchanges, democracy, and
process - and student-centred learning.</I><A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>

<P>Each is in danger, the authors point out, of not seeing the loopholes in
its own approaches, thereby "flattening" and confounding genuine
educational debate.

<P>The construct which follows is offered in the spirit of trying to
break through the polarization between the traditionalist and the
progressive camps in an effort to come to grips with questions of the
essential nature of education and methodologies which link these
essentials.  It will be obvious that one is working from the premise that
intellectual and moral endeavours are inter-related and that this has very
fundamental connections for the good life, morality, amorality, immorality,
and, not least, toward discovery of the real self.

<P>I would propose the construct of "moral vision" as a bridge for
those on the one hand who are, understandably, opposed to presenting to
students a purely cognitive and didactic approach to moral ideals but at
the same time fall prey to concentrating so exclusively on the personal
preference, affective domain that the rigors of critical and moral analysis
become irrelevant.  I am suggesting that the construct of moral vision and
the objective of developing in students the capacity for moral vision
incorporates both cognitive and affective components of learning and at the
same time avoids indoctrination.  As such, one is hopeful that this model
may offer a constructive alternative and even serve to break through a
measure of the entrenchment and polarization which characterizes much
current debate.<BR><BR><BR>

<P><B>MORAL IDEALS AND MORAL VISION</B>

<P>There is a critical difference between a moral ideal and moral vision. An
ideal is essentially a concept.  A vision is essentially an experience.  A
moral ideal - however one may "look" to it - remains "extrinsic" to
oneself;  an objective toward which one may (or may not) strive. Moral
vision, on the other hand, by its very nature denotes involvement; one
"sees" with the inner eye; one is touched in the inward person.

<P>An ideal can be dismissed as simply that; too ideal of attainment,
too far removed from the realities of life in today's society.  But a moral
vision cannot be dismissed, for it has been experienced.  It is alive.  It
is personally compelling.  It is the stuff of genuine morality, for moral
vision has its roots in both cognitive and affective insights and these
roots necessarily give life to moral incentive and commitment.  A moral
ideal can be taught.  There are various methods of teaching ideals - some
meaningful and some exceedingly non-meaningful - to which point we will
return.  Moral vision on the other hand cannot be taught.  It may, however,
be "caught."

<P>Perhaps it is necessary to state that the construct of moral vision
as put forward here is quite clearly based on the premise that certain
attitudes and behaviours in relationship with students - and indeed with
people in general - are more growth enhancing and humane than others;
justice and kindness are more humane than injustice and cruelty and so on.
While most educators would agree with this premise, as we have noted, a
major controversy still continues over whether teachers should be seen to
be promoting or in support of such virtues due to the perceived danger of
indoctrinating youth.  It is important therefore specifically to examine
the  distinctions between a moral ideal and moral vision as they translate
into teaching methodologies.  Let us approach this first-of-all using the
example of teaching mathematics, and then explore the obvious parallels
which pertain relative to the presentation of the moral virtues.<BR><BR><BR>

<P><B>A MATHEMATICAL "SENSE"</B>

<P>Conscientious math teachers, whether they are working with students at the
elementary or advanced level, seek above all, to inspire in their students
a "feel" for math, a mathematical "sense."  Some teachers do this well for
they enjoy the subject and their enthusiasm is catching.  They are
challenged by math not simply because they want to find the right answer,
but because they are excited about the discovery of relationships and
because they have a "sense" that they are grappling with fundamental
realities.  They have "caught a vision" of math as a holistic endeavour -
and they readily transmit this excitement to students.  At the same time,
however, it would be unthinkable for such a teacher to teach, for example,
that 4 + 4 = 8 "because it is simply a fact" or "because I say so."
Rather, he/she seeks to provide an experience for students within which
they are able to uncover and discover this reality themselves.

<P>Whereas the math teacher knows very well that there are
mathematical theorems and objective mathematical truths which pertain,
he/she will not present these theorems to be learned by rote.  After all,
being able to recite formulae and theorems does not constitute a grasp of
the subject on either the part of the teacher or the student.  The teacher
realizes that if this is the extent of learning, students will be unable to
creatively apply these "models" in advanced problem solving.  Theorems will
remain isolated parcels of memory work which ultimately disconnect and
alienate the student from discovering the holistic nature of math in which
lies, of course, both its essence and its excitement.

<P>It is only as students are given the opportunity to test these
theorems, in the sense that they may embrace and personally experience
their reality that they may genuinely validate their truths and know why
and to what end they may apply them meaningfully and creatively in problem
solving.  As this occurs, the student moves beyond a purely mechanical
problems-focused perception of math to "connect" with its universal and
holistic nature.  The student experiences math as an integrator of self,
society, and fundamental relationships.  This becomes exciting.  Euclid and
Copernicus come alive.  There are connections to explore and a self to
expand.

<P>But is it really essential to develop such a mathematical "sense?"
Students who do not "catch" such a vision become increasingly disenchanted
and disengage from investing themselves in it as a serious endeavour.  They
regard it as an isolated "subject" rather than a perspective.  A whole
world becomes closed to their intellectual and, one would argue, moral
sensibilities.<BR><BR><BR>

<P><B>A MORAL SENSE</B>

<P>By now the parallels with the addressment of the moral virtues are obvious.
Educators fear, and validly so, that if moral principles or theorems such
as honesty, justice, and compassion are inculcated on the basis of being
"obvious fact" or "because I say so," these principles will be regarded as
ponderous rules or abstractions outside the "self" - divorced from real
meaning.  Again, validly, we hold that it is only as the student is given
the opportunity to test these moral principles in the sense that he or she
does (or does not) experience their reality, that the student may be able
to genuinely validate them and know whether or not, or why, and to what end
he or she will commit to them.  As educators then, we need to identify
modalities which might offer such opportunity for cognitive and affective
moral exposure and for testing validity.  From Von Goethe:

<P><I>A teacher who can arouse a feeling for one single good action, for one
single good poem, accomplishes more than he who fills our memory with row
on row of natural objects, classified with name and form.</I><A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>

<P>Precisely. In the same way that we spoke of teaching mathematics
toward a mathematical "sense," it is incumbent upon us to follow the same
objectives and methodology through the teaching of literature, history,
philosophy, music, art, politics, and science.  For this is the beauty and
wisdom of a liberal arts education.  It fosters a perspective which
addresses the human condition with all its vagaries, inviting dialogue,
refuting easy answers, calling us to transcend the mediocrity of self at
the centre.

<P>Further, in An Experiment In Criticism, C.S. Lewis asks, "Why do we
read?" Not to "get" morality, but toward the enlargement of our beings;
the opportunity to "see" and experience through another's lens.  For
example, he said, he was not looking for C.S. Lewis in Lucretius but open
to discovering Lucretius in C.S. Lewis.<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>  Unless this is the nature of the
search, I am always meeting myself:  I see everything through my own mirror
or the mirror of my special interest/lobby group which may take its
perspective (mirror) as the measure of all things.  Indeed such groups may
seek to dictate to me the necessary components of my self-esteem in which
case I can become a faceless means toward their prescriptive end.  In
either case, when my self or group-esteem is challenged, I can become
highly threatened by opposing perspectives and openly hostile, unable to
risk reasonable open debate in the spirit of civility.  In fact, Canadian
schools are becoming militant platforms for individual and group violence.

<P>With corresponding dogmatism, classical works of art and literature
can be deconstructed to parochial and exclusionist interpretations which
seek to deflect the fact that eternal questions have a way of getting
through to us in a way that oratorical answers do not.  But the eternal
questions get through only when we become aware that we have been
programmed not to hear them, and as we seek to allow them expression.  In
fact, it is interaction with those eternal questions which takes us out of
ourselves.  It breaks the circle of wholly reflecting or wholly
experiencing because, in this perspective, which inspires vision, one can
reflect and experience at the same time.  Put another way, the possibility
for union takes place.  The music plays the band.  This is the intrinsic
connectedness and freedom which liberal arts education understands so well.

<P>Another modality which offers opportunity for moral vision is of
course relationship between persons or in community.  It can be argued, for
example, that it is primarily through relationship that one really "knows"
compassion for one has experienced it and can therefore "connect" with it
as having reality and intrinsic validity.  Beyond cognitive appreciation of
the concept, in relationship one affectively understands and "feels"(i.e.
experiences) the fundamental distinction, for example, between "Looking Out
For #1"<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> and I shall pass through this world but once. Any good therefore that I can do,
or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now.  Let
me not defer or neglect it for I shall not pass this way again.<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>

<P>One has moved beyond perceiving morality as a list of ideals to
personally uncover and discover its universal and holistic nature.  One
"catches" a vision of the virtues as integrators of self and society.<BR><BR><BR>

<P><B>THE TEACHER AS ROLE MODEL IN RELATIONSHIP</B>

<P>By and large, teachers are very aware that the teacher-student relationship
can be a key factor in a pupil's life.  They are aware that especially when
a student is, for example, lacking in compassion he or she desperately
needs personally to experience compassion to be able to test and validate
whether it can be real.  But actually to be that testing ground; to respond
to students with compassion;  to mobilize the psychic and spiritual energy
necessary to cope with dislike of some students, anger and threat, is very
costly.

<P>Understandably the teacher as role model is not very popular among
teachers today.  Yet this is moral vision in living action and it is
exceedingly powerful. It is not a hypothetical moral dilemma or a contrived
exercise about compassion or honesty or justice.  It is seeing and feeling
a teacher being compassionate, honest, and fair, especially when it is
difficult to be so.  At the same time, it should be self-evident that
helping to create and maintain classrooms as moral communities is not only
the function of students, their parents, and classroom teachers, but also
the mutually supportive responsibility of principals, school boards, and
ministries of education across all echelons of the system.<BR><BR><BR>

<P><B>THE QUESTION</B>

<P>It is easy enough to nod our heads in agreement with this concept of moral
vision actively lived in moral community.  Yet it requires far more than
intellectual assent.  It requires hard work.  It asks each individual to
confront the issue at a very personal level;  to ask "Are there any moral
principles which I have experienced and tested and found to be valid:
Honesty?  Justice?  Compassion?"  That is, do I "connect" with any of these
moral ideals as being essential integrators within my person and in my
relationship with others (e.g., "I will be compassionate even when it is
difficult to be so.").  Have they become for me deep and consistent
commitments of will and heart;  integral to my moral vision?  For example,
do I feel less than my "self" when I am not compassionate;  that I have
compromised a basic tenet of my being and broken a form of sacred trust
afforded me as a human being among other human beings?

<P>If the answer to these questions is "yes," then each attitude and
each situation in one's life will reflect this holistic integrative
orientation.  At the same time, that individual will not be indoctrinating
others, for one cannot indoctrinate a moral vision.  One can simply offer
as consistently as is possible an experience of honesty and benevolence,
through which others may touch into the essence of commitment which, by its
very nature, will involve self-sacrifice.  And in participating in this
essence, genuine community may be born.

<P>If, on the other hand, the answer to the question is "no," then
each attitude, each behaviour, each situation in a relationship will be a
law unto itself - disconnected from any holistic or integrating principle
(e.g., "I will be compassionate if I feel like it or if the other
'deserves' it").  For the teacher, the endeavour of being a role model in
relationship will be rejected as irrelevant because there is nothing
foundational or consistent to offer to students.  There is no frame of
reference to inspire moral, intellectual, or spiritual vision;  in
Aristotle's terms, a rejection of ethos (habit) and logos (reason) as
essential components.  Indeed where this is the case there is no reason for
anyone to reach outside his or her self;  only a pooling of subjectivity
which serves to keep us circling in the whirlpool of individual rights.
Indeed there is a sense that without the ego-inflating protection of
self-esteem to buoy me up, I may become irretrievably sucked under.
Consequently (or what I may perceive to be consequently), I must choose to
answer "no" to risking the possibility of life lived beyond self at the
centre.  And thereby evolves the end of conscience. For as long as
self-esteem remains a god, legitimizing whatever perversions the autonomous
self may elect to pursue, it is surely true that community will not be
possible.  For bastardized forms of community in their collectivized
reification of self-esteem cling to tribal exclusivism and name it
"culture."<BR><BR><BR>

<P><B>EXPECTATION AND DISENCHANTMENT AS BROKEN GROUND FOR ENCOUNTER</B>

<P>In order to understand the foregoing in context, it is important to
appreciate that up until quite recently in this land of opportunity, most
Canadians have believed in the inevitability of progress.  In many respects
this power model may be described on four "legs:"    1)  the inevitable
triumph of objective critical intelligence over superstition, 2)
sophistication over simplicity, 3) human beings over nature, and 4)
abundance over scarcity.<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>  It has been assumed that the combination of
high-tech electronic and scientific management would power these four
dynamics.  Much of our confidence in this assumption centres in the ever
evolving powers of the computer and its revolutionary capabilities to
reduce the "human error factor."

<P>Less-heeded are warnings that our ability to think creatively about
our world may be undermined by the very "information" which is supposed to
help us understand it:  that the data processing mind-set may replace
thought, and that "data glut" may obscure basic questions of justice and
purpose.<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>  Clearly minute-by-minute eye witnessing of the Gulf War
computer strikes, and yet the subsequent non-"victory" of this war, gave a
razor-sharp edge to these warnings about the machine as human and the human
as machine.  And on a continuing basis, the push of a control button is all
that is required to be "entertained" by Bosnian carnage, pornographic
fantasies, killer video games at the corner arcade or, more symbolically,
in the "family" room.  This instant stop/start/replay/ violence and
destruction depending upon one's mood of the moment becomes fertile ground
for the illusion of power and control at the cost of the utter
desensitization of self.

<P>On the social organization side of Canadian society we
recognize the increase in crime, gangs, substance abuse, and the numbers of
disenfranchised.  But by and large we have assumed and counted on the fact
that this could be handled by the appropriate organization employing the
appropriate experts.  This has given rise to an ever-expanding class of
professionals who claim a monopoly on the basis of their bio-psycho-social
(i.e., "scientific") expertise - in social contract exchange for the
public's legitimation and trust.

<P>But there is an angry restlessness now;  a sense that the "experts"
do not have all the answers and that our social institutions are not
holding.  At root, there is a lack of consensus about direction and
"values" and this is acted out by individuals and groups through anger,
scapegoating, and distorted perceptions of "me as victim."  This, in turn,
feeds back into the social psychology of our institutions - the educational
system being a prime example and a most critical one.

<P>In short, to the extent that a society's norms and values are
unclear and dissociated from each other and from implementation in
practice, day-to-day living in that society becomes idiosyncratic and
fragmented.  At the same time, we are loath to admit that the system isn't
working because we are afraid.  So the pretense of truth and justice
persists:  rhetoric to mask the half-true or the untrue.  In many of us,
perhaps, there is the unspoken realization that as individuals we (choose
to) participate in the hypocrisy and the power/control configurations which
continue to perpetuate and further compound the very situations and
problems we say we deplore.  We "go with the flow" on the rationale that
one has to survive.  Damn the system, play the system, work the system,
change it later?

<P>We fight appearances with more appearances, layering on more jewelry to
suit the occasion.  It looks good, it feels good, it enhances the image.
No longer are we in touch with whether or not we are trying to obscure the
basic garment if, in fact, we are wearing a basic garment at all.   Perhaps
the truth of the matter is that the jewelry has become the garment.<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>

<P>Exactly.  The jewelry of deconstructionism is accented with
self-esteem.  Can adults be surprised that in projecting this life-view
into the classrooms of our nation we are clocking escalating rates of
teenage disorientation and suicide?

<P>Characteristically, children and youth are the first to detect
disconnectedness and pretense in adults around them.  They are singularly
open to truth beyond that which is seen.  They deserve opportunities for
vision.  In the midst of shattered expectations, considerable
disillusionment and a deep sense of malaise in Canadian society, we stand
in danger of grounding such opportunities by  claiming self-esteem  as our
ultimate security i.e., "I am all I've got."   As a result, many of our
strategies for building self-esteem are misdirected - they address the
visible (material) manifestation of our discontent rather than tracking the
invisible (spiritual) root from which it springs.<BR><BR><BR>

<P><B>VISION REVISITED</B>

<P>I have tried to suggest that vision and, ultimately, hope lie in examining
and addressing foundational and relational reality beyond self as the
centre.  Northrop Frye recognizes that this is how vision develops:
"Normally it is only after prolonged contact with a specific discipline of
thought or imagination that one can face the kind of reality that
detachment reveals, a reality unaffected by socially acquired prejudices or
passions of the ego."<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>

<P>I have proposed that there are significant parallels between
teaching math toward developing a mathematical "sense" and teaching the
virtues toward developing the capacity for moral vision.  In fact both, as
vision, require personal discipline if they are to be lived commitments.
They offer essential connectors and integrators of the self:  connectors
and integrators in the sense that the self is called to touch into
fundamental realities and in so doing comes to recognize our illusions as
addiction.  This can actually lead to a reframing of ego reality as
referenced in the increasingly popular Twelve Step Programs which recognize
the limits of ego and the necessity to invest in matters of the spirit.<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>

<P>Indeed it is as we accept our human condition in humility that
ironically enough we transcend our absorption with ego.  This alternative
way is often very painful.  It demands perseverance of heart and will
toward a gradual realization that the illusory or "false" self, as Thomas
Merton would have it,<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> clings feverishly to its own agenda of pride, power
and control and actually serves to limit the freedom of clear, honest
vision.  In Biblical terms, this is stated as the freedom which comes in
losing one's life in order to find it.<A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>  This internal and persevering
engagement toward the integrating of mind, body, and spirit is not for
cowards.  It entails a willingness to penetrate the truth rather than to
speculate on our own terms.  There is an acceptance that the need to search
for our true self is deep within each of us, that we do not grow out of it,
that it is not childish or immature, much less merely "traditional."  It is
this quest which liberal arts education embraces with all vigor.

<P>I have tried to trace the "way" as being an attitude of heart
(vision) as differentiated from simply "feeling" or cerebral opinion, and
have suggested that the true professional professes from inner experience
of this attitude.  These attributes have been recently mocked and abandoned
because of the prevalent hypocrisy of disconnecting the experience from the
ideal.  I would submit that this underlines much of what is currently
defined as the crisis in self-esteem.  Surely the way to move further is
again to begin the humble way of trying to live out the mystery of the way
which itself provides the superhuman grounding of confidence in each
individual who risks to begin, to falter, and to persevere.

<H2>Overcoming "The Culture of Disbelief"</H2>
<I>M.H. Ogilvie
Professor of Law,
Carleton University,
Ottawa, 1995.</I>

<P>In my more pessimistic mental rambles around the topic of the relationship
of religion and Canadian society at the close of the twentieth century, I
frequently detour to the sack of Rome in 410 A.D. by Alaric the Goth, which
caused the severe psychological stress for Christians in the late Roman
Empire, so neatly captured by Jerome when he wrote, "If Rome can perish,
what can be safe?" (Ep. 123, 16).

<P>This cataclysmic event drove Christians across the sea to North Africa and
to the diocese of Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, who responded by writing his
final book, De civitate dei, over the last fifteen years of his life, completing it
just before his death in 430 A.D.

<P>Augustine considered it to be his best book, the culmination of his
thinking over a 70 year period, on the meaning and purpose of life in this
world. Yet, for the most part, De civitate dei is not just a theological
treatise, rather it is a vast work of pastoral theology, prompted by a
pastor's concern for his flock.

<P>Augustine sought to comfort the Christian refugees of his day, by reminding
them that while Rome had been a great empire, established for providential
purposes, its fall, and the loss of their property, their suffering,
deprivation and even death, was no ultimate loss.  Rather, their real
future and hope should be in things eternal - in the glorious City of God
not the transient City of Man.

<P>The analogy of the early 5th century with our own day is undoubtedly
superficial, yet in a limited way, enlightening.  The Roman Empire had been
nominally a Christian empire after the conversion of Constantine in 313
A.D. and the adoption of Christianity as the state religion in 324 A.D.

<P>The early Christian church was already fractured into numerous competing
sects, each boasting that it possessed the universal and exclusive truth.
The Empire had been repeatedly overrun by "barbarians", from a variety of
races and cultures, bringing their alien ways of life, alien beliefs and
alien practices into the heart of the greatest empire the world had yet
seen.  The ruling elites lived lives of private debauchery and public
corruption, enjoyed the rewards of ruling status, but were unable to repair
the deterioration of both economic and social infrastructures and the
general decline in economic well-being.  Violence and crime were rife in
the large cities of the Empire, exacerbated by racial, religious and
economic rivalries and jealousies.  To many the "end of history" seemed to
be at hand.  And Alaric was a baptized Christian.

<P>Against a similar historical backdrop, there is among Christians in Canada
a rising tide of apprehension, anger, a sense of betrayal and alarm at the
speed with which the formerly Christian fabric of Canadian society has been
unraveled within the half-generation since 1982 and certainly within the
generation since 1968.  It may not be politically correct to observe that
the sacking of Christian Canada has been largely accomplished by baptized
Christians.  Yet, the Alarics in our legislatures and on our benches have
demonstrated that laws can be as effective as fire and the sword in the
destruction of earthly cities, and that persecution and oppression can be
equally wrought by psychological as well as physical means.

<P>Augustine described the state as a "band of brigands" - an analogy with
which many find it easy to identify in Canada today, as they sense that
something is terribly wrong in their country, that Canada, like the United
States, seems to be careening out of control, while its elites plunder
their spiritual inheritance and increasingly deny its expression in
everyday life.

<P>While it is the Christian community which is primarily under siege from
lawmakers in Canada today, by virtue of its greater numbers, it is mistaken
to think that Christians are the only target of the self-assumed smart and
sophisticated legislators and judges of the past generation.  Rather, it is
religious faith itself, in all its forms, which is the target - that
precious sense imprinted in human kind that there is a deep mystery at the
heart of the universe, whose personal knowledge gives the highest meaning
and purpose to the otherwise seemingly accidental collection of existential
events of ordinary existence.  While some members of non-Christian
religious groups, recently arrived in Canada, still think that they are
striking a blow for freedom of religion against a strong and powerful
Christian establishment, by targeting Sunday pause days or public school
holidays, the more recent increase in co-operation amongst adherents of
both Christian and non-Christian religions in targeting the modern,
liberal, secular state, and all its works, suggests growing appreciation of
the political power of a common foe.

<P>In any case, the speed of the collapse of the Christian edifice and the
paucity of dust and rubble left behind in the public square (although not
necessarily on the private hearth) suggests it to have been a cardboard
facade, a movie set, long ago gutted, and requiring only a whisper to
topple. As psychologically satisfying as it may be, to open for Sunday
shopping or wear a kirpan to school, the fact remains that the gutting of
the Christian public square has been largely the work of nominal Christians
over the past few generations, who have suffered profound doubt, loss of
self-confidence and nerve, in the face of secular modernism.  When judges
can blandly assert (as did the Ontario C.A. in Peel,<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> in 1991) that Christmas
and Good Friday are mere commercial holidays devoid of religious significance, and
sustainable as such, as holidays, the Christian game in the public square
is clearly up.

<P>Assaulted for over a century by science, socialism, affluence and the
ridicule of the intelligentsia, many Christians have retreated to
self-doubt, self-loathing, loss of faith, apology and compromise -
frequently finding temporary relief in accommodation with
apparently compatible secular ideologies, such as the social
gospel with the welfare state.  But accommodation has too often
metamorphosed into assimilation, so that purportedly Christian
communities often minimize and trivialize belief to the point
of non-recognition.

<P>Yet, some signs that the corner has been turned and assimilation has been
identified as faith-destroying, are now evident, as the Christian community
realizes that not only ought it not to be regarded as the real target but
rather that in harmony with Moslems, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jews should turn
to face the true enemy of all people of faith, the secular, socialist state
in Canada and its institutional fellow-travelers.  It is the state and its
instruments, the legislatures, the courts, the social welfare agencies, the
schools and universities, which have neutered, trivialized, ridiculed and
banned from public discourse the practice and expression of faith in the
public square.

<P>This banishment of religion qua religion from the public square in Western
societies may well constitute a turning point in the evolution of the
liberal, democratic state from freedom to a totalitarianism which threatens
not only faithful citizens but all citizens who wish to pursue their
personal visions for their lives in liberty and to participate in public
discourse on any topic in the language they naturally use.  The alarming
acceleration in the silencing of voices deemed to be politically incorrect
- and there can be no more politically incorrect voice than the voice of
faith in the public square - suggests that the movement from democracy to
totalitarianism is further advanced than might be wished.

<P>Let us consider what our legislatures and courts have done in recent
years to bring us to this not so pretty pass.  Examples of attempts to
eradicate religion from the significant experiences, events and
relationships of life abound.

<P><B>1. Education:</B>  All religious faiths share a common future:  their children.
Therefore, it is hardly surprising that the school classroom is the most
shell-pocked battleground for religious disputes whether between faiths or
between church and state.  It is salutary to recall that state-financed
public education systems are a recent feature of Western societies and that
for our great grandparents, the church-run school and university was the
social and educational norm.  However, with the advent of state schooling,
the requirement of the state that children attend school at least until age
sixteen, because this is thought to be in the future best interests of
society, means that the battle for the classroom is permanently joined.

<P>Since education is funded by parents and other taxpayers, it might be
expected that the educational establishments and courts would pay some
attention to their concerns generally, and in particular to the concerns of
religious parents, in the education of their children.  So, what of it?

<P>Religious exercises (even faith-based through the temporary separation of
children) - banned by the Ontario Court of Appeal in 1988 (Zylberberg).<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>

<P>Religious instruction (even faith-based through the temporary separation of
children) - banned by the Ontario Court of Appeal in 1989/91 (Essex County
Case).<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>

<P>Funding for religious schools on a Charter s. 15(1) equality basis with
Roman Catholic schools - denied on the grounds that this would be
destructive to the public schools and that Roman Catholic school funding is
an irrelevant historical anomaly whose constitutional entrenchment puts it
beyond further re-examination for all eternity - the Supreme Court of
Canada in 1986 (Education Act Case)<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> and the Ontario Court of Appeal in
1994 (Adler).<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>

<P>And, as for home-schooling by religious parents, the Supreme Court of
Canada has said that when provincial legislation requires provincial
certification, a failure to invite state approval is not protected by s.
2(a) of the Charter but is a reason to prohibit home-schooling as a
reasonable limit demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society
pursuant to s. 1 of the Charter (Jones, 1985)<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>.

<P>And as for the universities?  Well, while "academic freedom" (whatever that
means) has probably precluded judicial supervision of university life to
date, it is well-known that the culture of contemporary Canadian
universities is such that academic freedom may only protect the attempted
indoctrination of students in Marxism, radical feminism and the other
current obsessions of an intellectually and morally decadent
intelligentsia.  Become known as a religious person on campus, whether
student or professor, and you will be professionally sidelined, publicly
ridiculed (with no speech code protection) and suspected of or be openly
accused of being unfit to hold a university appointment.  History, politics, philo-
sophy, literature, must now be taught with religion left out.  And,
of course, those modern subjects, such as sociology, psychology,
criminology, have been largely anti-thetical to religion from
their respective outsets.

<P>In short, with the exception of the state-financed schools of those
constitutionally privileged Roman Catholics, our public educational system
is a spiritual wasteland, devastated by the courts and the
educational establishment.  But, in recent years, more sinister still, the
schoolroom has become a centre for attack upon religious belief and the
moral values instilled through belief.  Faith - all faiths - are treated
like life-style choices, all equally valid and invalid, like homosexuality.
Thus, children are placed in a situation of confusion where the lessons in
the classroom contradict the moral directions given by devout parents of
all faiths, a situation with the potential to undermine permanently the
relationship of parent and child.

<P>The eradication of religion from the public school classroom has been
virtually achieved.  The assault upon the nurturing of religious faith by
home and church in the growing child has begun.

<P><B>2. Employment:</B> There have been three major points of confrontation between
the religiously devout and their employers over the past decade or so:
absence from the workplace on holy days; wearing religious dress or
religious symbols on the job; and, attempts to control the private lives of
employees.

<P>While the education cases show the consistent application of the principle
that religion be banned from the classroom, a somewhat different pattern
seems to run through the employment cases, that is, the courts have
generally accommodated religious practice on the job with one exception.

<P>Where the challenges have been made by members of minority, often
recently-arrived groups, the courts have always acceded to their requests,
but where the issue has been an employer requirement of a religious
practice for mainstream Protestant employees, the judicial decision has
almost always gone against the enforcement of that requirement.

<P>Thus, both courts and human rights tribunals have required employers to
accommodate to the point of hardship the holy days of Seventh Day
Adventism, the Worldwide Church of God, Judaism, and of one solitary member
of the Free Church of Scotland, residing in Ontario (O'Malley; <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> Christie;<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> Renaud;<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> Gohm;<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> Rand;<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> Janssen<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>).

<P>Sikhs have been permitted to wear turbans when safety helmets might have
been thought advisable (with potential social costs to all taxpayers in the
event of accidents) (Bhinder<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>) and kirpans where a weapon-free environment
might seem safer, in schools and hospitals - but not in the courts
(Singh<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>).

<P>But where an evangelical Christian school or nursing home have sought to
ensure that their employees practice Christian moral precepts in their
private lives and accordingly have dismissed employees living common law or
who have had children out of wedlock, their reinstatement has been ordered
on the ground that Christian lives are not a bona fide occupational
requirement for employment in Christian institutions, unless this is made
an express written condition of employment.  (Garrod<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>; Parks<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>; Lothian<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>).

<P>By contrast, the courts have consistently upheld the constitutional right
of Roman Catholic schools to dismiss teachers who have married outside the
church, indeed in all the reported cases to believing and practising
Protestants, as within the ambit of the s. 93 entrenched rights of these
schools. (Caldwell<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>; Stack<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>; Casagrande<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>; NTA<A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>).  Thus, dismissal for
"denominational cause" is permitted to Roman Catholic school boards because
it is thought to be constitutionally mandated, but denied to other
Christian institutions.  Thus, the accommodation of some religious
practices is permitted but others may not be insisted upon even within a
religious institution.

<P>No devout person of any faith can be critical of the decisions relating to
holy days or wearing religious symbols on the job - members of all faiths
would hope to receive similar treatment.  Wearing crosses or crucifixes is,
after all, offensive to many Christians, yet these practices have never
been illegal.  However, the denial of a right to privately-funded
Protestant organizations to require a Christian life of their employees is
deeply troubling.  Is this reverse discrimination against Protestants?  Are
the courts trashing some imagined Protestant establishment or engaging in
self-hatred? Or, is the unspoken trajectory uniting both education and
employment cases, an equally unspoken judicial assault upon Protestantism
in Canada?  The proper interpretation of these cases is fraught with
ambiguity.

<P><B>3. Family Life:</B>  Religion and the law intersect in two areas of family life
today:  custody in divorce proceedings and health care decisions for
minors.  At one time, the law regulated virtually all aspects of family
life, primarily through the Criminal Code, so as to en-
force Christian moral and sexual teaching in relation both to
family and other personal relationships. Most of this legislation
has been repealed, leaving citizens free to make their own choices
in such matters.

<P>Nevertheless, courts do continue to intervene, particularly when decisions
involving children must be made. Thus, in making custody and access orders,
courts give instructions in relation to the religious upbringing of the
children - whether they may be taken to religious services,  participate in
other religious activities (proselytizing), or be given religious
instruction in the homes.  The overriding principle in making such orders
is the best interests of the child, as determined by the court.<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>  While I
strongly believe that family court judges try to do their absolute best in
making such orders, it should be recalled that most faiths regard parents,
alone, as having authority over their children, so that the potential for
conflict is ever present when the state purports to exercise its authority
over children in a fashion conflicting with parental views.

<P>Courts have also recently removed decisions about the health care of
children from their parents in matters of life and death when
religious issues have to be weighed, in particular, in relation to those
cases in which Jehovah's Witnesses' children requiring blood transfusions
are placed in protection for the duration of the treatment and then are
returned to their parents after the course of treatment has ended.  The
religious views of the parents have been entirely overridden and deemed
irrelevant to a decision based on the secular, modern preference for life
at all costs, even (for religious people) at the cost of eternal life.<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>

<P><B>4. Health:</B>  While the courts and the legislature have generally left adults
with the freedom to determine their own health care on the basis of their
religious or other beliefs, protecting these decisions through the common
law doctrines of informed consent and the torts of assault and battery, the
beginning and the end of life have come to be matters of debate in the
public square, with strangers attempting to shape laws within which those
whom they do not know will have their fates determined.  Presumably, the
reason that birth and death have come to be contentious matters is that at
each point in life, a person is not able to make informed choices for
herself, and the issues are of who shall make those choices and what
criteria shall be used to make those choices.  Matters of life and death
have become public property today as society appears to abound in persons
willing to make decisions on behalf of the unborn fetus and the unconscious
dying person.

<P>Since the de-criminalization of abortion by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Morgentaler<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> in 1988, theoretically, women are legally free to have
abortions.  Those whose religious views prohibit abortion need not undergo
the procedure.  But should those whose religious views prohibit abortion as
murder expect to use the public law to force those who do not share their
views to forgo the procedure?  Would they wish to have the views of others
in other medical issues forced upon them?  Who should make the decision -
the party or parties most closely concerned or society generally, or at
least that part of society which makes our laws?  Paradoxically, a
religious view which regards parents as having God-given authority over
their children to the exclusion of all others is compatible with the view
that the decision over the future of the fetus belongs to its parents; who
must also, of course, take responsibility for their decision to all
eternity.

<P>That abortion is no longer regarded as a moral decision founded in
religious beliefs about the sanctity of divinely created life is evident in
two features of the public debate over the past decade or so.  First, the
public abortion debate has been transformed from being about the right to
life and/or murder of an unborn fetus into a women's equality issue.

<P>Morgentaler exemplified and blessed this transformation, as the Supreme
Court adopted the construction of the issue advocated by radical feminism,
as solely a women's issue. As a result, secondly, public funding for
abortion through the tax system means that religious people opposed to
abortion on religious grounds or those who are opposed to it on other moral
grounds are nevertheless obligated to support it indirectly.  Thus,
abortion-funding has come to represent the fundamental moral dilemma which
the welfare state poses for people of all faiths, insofar as political
elites have created legal entitlements funded by reluctant taxpayers to
state-financed services unreflective of the moral views of substantial
numbers of taxpayers.

<P>Death could be defined as the ultimate equality issue since it is the fate
we are all born equally to face.  The recent public debate as to how the
public law should be drafted to impose public solutions on decisions that
touch on matters of faith, suggests once more that decisions about life and
death, in relation to which most religions speak, are being removed from
their original theological context to be tossed around on the sea of public
opinion, as shaped frequently by non-
religious people.  Whether the issue is the legal status of living wills
requesting "no heroic measures"; self-inflicted suicide; assisted
suicide; or active euthanasia, most religious people would prefer to make
their own decision informed by their own theological views both for
themselves and for their immediate relatives, rather than in the light of
state-imposed views not necessarily similar to their own.

<P><B>5. The Welfare State:</B> Underlying the foregoing issues is, of course, the
general problem which an homogenous welfare state poses in a religiously
and culturally plural society.  At one time, when western societies were
more homogenous than they are now,
it seemed a good idea to ensure that minimum standards of living were
accorded to those members of society who could not gain such for themselves
and that the state was the most appropriate vehicle
for that wealth transfer.  Now, we are no longer sure about much
that is done in the name of social justice, especially when affirmative
action programs increasingly appear to bestow special legal and
economic privileges on sections of or groups in society whose
privileges are founded on claims repugnant morally to the faithful
of many religions.

<P>In earlier, less complex societies in which families and communities of
faith cared for one another in sickness and in health, and in which
governments were small and far away, the separation of church and state
could be more easily accommodated, although ironically, was hardly
necessary in light of the cultural and religious homogeneity of those
societies.  But the modern, welfare state with its complex social welfare
system and universal taxation base makes it difficult for religious people
to devote the fruits of their labours to social projects congruent with
their religious beliefs.  Indeed, when such a political system is dominated
by elites who would silence contrary voices, religious or not, the tension
created for religious people who are under a duty of good stewardship of
their earthly possessions is very great indeed.  As individual taxpayers
have learned when they have withheld taxes in relation to government
expenditures on defence (Prior<A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>) or for abortion funding (O'Sullivan<A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>),
the courts are unsympathetic, characterizing the dilemma as either a
chimera in the mind of a just quite possibly unbalanced litigant or as a trivial
infringement of freedom of belief and as such permissible in a free and
democratic society.

<P>Of course, chaos would result if it were otherwise - it would be impossible
to tailor tax regimes for every individual taxpayer and to re-jig them
periodically to reflect that taxpayer's changing views in life.  It is,
therefore, hardly surprising that the solution increasingly advocated by
religious people is to reduce the size of the state and the number of
entitlements to the minimum  required for economic progress:  real
classroom education, basic health care and law and order.  Let all
citizens, including citizens of  faith, be free to dedicate their money to
the private entitlement systems which accord with their beliefs, once the
basics for a civilized society have been provided universally.

<P><B>6. Intrusion into Domestic Church Affairs:</B>  Courts, and occasionally
legislatures, have always in our constitutional system, founded on
Parliamentary sovereignty, had jurisdiction to regulate the internal
domestic affairs of religious institutions.  In the past, diffidence and
reluctance to interfere was the normal response, although there are
certainly cases of intervention when a court thought that to be the
appropriate response.  Recently, intervention has become more frequent,
indeed approaching the norm, and courts no longer begin their decisions
with those embarrassed apologies at having to interfere, once ritually
expressed by reluctant judges prior to rendering judgment.

<P>Admittedly, judicial intervention has been good at times, such as in the
recent spate of cases requiring the United Church of Canada to employ fair
procedures in its church courts  - an injunction equally applicable to
other denominations as well (Lindenberger<A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>; McCaw<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>; Davis <A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>; Lakeside<A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>).

<P>On the other hand, once the practice of intervention in domestic matters
becomes ingrained in the judicial attitude to religious institutions, one
must fear for a future in which the issue is not procedure, but substantive
theology, and in which theological issues are transformed into equality
issues, such as the ordination of practising homosexuals or of women, in
those churches theologically opposed to such.  There is no current reason
for optimism that theology will be accorded precedence to "equality", when
such issues come before our secularized courts, as the transformation of
the abortion issue predicts.

<P>How might we summarize these developments since 1982?  Essentially,
religion has been excised from the schools and universities and from those
family arrangements which are still obliged to come into contact with the
law.  Other issues, which were once regarded as governed by divine
revelation, as found in holy books, have been re-categorized in public
discourse as equality issues, in which the dominant voices in the public
square are those whose views contravene divine
revelation, and who may also have, according to
opinion polls, tiny support bases within the general population.  While the
courts increasingly intervene in the domestic affairs of religious organiza-
tions, whether by dictating the life styles permitted to their employees or
by re-instating dismissed clergy.

<P>Under the rubric of freedom of religion, as a society we have moved quickly
toward freedom from religion.  The modern, overarching welfare state has
proven itself to be as much as enemy of religious autonomy as it is of
economic, political, social and individual moral autonomy.

<P>It is possible to be even more specific and to suggest five general
underlying themes and trends in these legal developments in Canada.
First, most of the cases inviting confrontation between church and state in
Canada have been initiated by members of recently-arrived minority
religious groups, who think that they are engaged in a
great work, wresting freedom and liberation from a strong Christian state.

<P>Nothing could be further from the truth. They are tilting
to windmills. The left-liberal judiciary happily accommodates
them because as secular moderns, they no longer care.  Thus, the social
task of thinking through how to make religious pluralism work has fallen
into the laps of the religiously cynical - an unpleasant prospect for all.

<P>Secondly, the accommodation of non-Christian religious groups has been
largely at the expense of the historic religious minorities in Canada -
Anglicans, Baptists, Lutherans, Mennonites, Presbyterians.  The religious
censuses since Confederation show that the largest religious group in
Canada has always been the Roman Catholic church and since the 1951 Census,
it has also been just about the majority, hovering about 50% of the
population.  The historical Protestant denominations have always been,
individually, minority religions in Canada in contrast to the Roman
Catholic church and have never enjoyed the constitutional entrenchment of
powers enjoyed by that church pursuant to s. 93, other than for a period of
about 60 years in Quebec before the provincial government watered down the
funding guarantees for Protestant denominational schools.

<P>Thirdly, while the purpose of recent litigation had been to achieve
accommodation within Canadian society, the effect of the litigation has
been the removal, generally, of religion from public life and public
institutions.  Of course, this may well be the only workable solution in
the classroom or in the Criminal Code, but an unwanted outcome has also
been the marginalization and, therefore, trivialization of religion as a
significant factor in both public and private lives.

<P>Fourthly, the trivialization and marginalization of religious perspectives
has been facilitated  and legalized by the legislatures and especially the
courts, which have been manned for most of the past
generation by secularized judges and legislators, who do not even bother,
in contrast to their American equivalents, to pay public lip-service to
religious concerns.  The assault on "Christian Canada" mounted by recently
arrived religious groups has meshed quite
nicely with the political and social agendas of the political elite.

<P>Fifthly, the net result has been the transformation of many public issues
from moral or theological issues rooted in divine revelation as God's
purpose for his creation into secular issues, framed as equality issues by
predominantly anti-religious special interest groups and their liberal
supporters, in a way which frequently perverts and disguises their origins
in religious morality.  The reason for the political success of this
transformation is clear - who can be opposed to equality?  Thus, even
religious people are reluctantly co-opted into the secular goals of our
secular society.  Contemporary society requires some schizophrenia of the
devout of all faiths as they accommodate often conflicting public and
private agendas.  Some release from this tension might be got by adopting a
live and let live attitude;  however, momentary recall that, as a taxpayer,
the devout person in a welfare state is still required to finance conduct
regarded as morally wrong, because it is a contravention of God's laws,
quickly deflates that easy option. Not surprisingly, public debate, once
inconceivable, about
dismantlement of both public social nets and private employment benefit
plans is beginning, not simply because the money may no longer be there
but, more importantly, because the public will may no longer be there
either.

<P>From the perspective of a religious person, the dismantlement in
substantial part of the excessive state entitlement schemes might allow for
the recovery of what the homogenous welfare state has obscured, individual
identity as a religious person within a community of faith, leading a life
of integrity rather than alienation. One of the great gifts of all
religious groups in Canada, brought by recent immigrants from other
religious traditions, is the remembrance of and models for the recovery of
integrity and coherence as communities of faith.  Additionally, these
groups have further demonstrated how important to community integrity and
identity is the willingness to speak in the public square in a religious
voice.  That is, to assert in the teeth of
secular politics and its marginalization of religious perspectives that
communities of faith can be autonomous and independent centres of authority
and meaning with as justifiable a claim, even measured against liberal
criteria, to be protected and heard as such in public
discourse as the claims of other special interest groups today.  The
assimilation of indigenous 20th century Protestantism in Canada with
secular modernism stands reproved in contrast.

<P>The idea that religious groups usefully serve as autonomous centres of
authority in the modern state is not new. In his clairvoyant book,
Democracy in America, published in 1848, Baron Alexis de Tocqueville
commented on the role religious groups could play vis--vis the modern
state, as a bulwark against state tyranny for the ordinary person and as an
independent moral voice.  Recently, Professor Stephen Carter of Yale Law
School has re-worked this theme in The Culture of Disbelief, published in
1993. The observation is equally applicable in Canada today.

<P>To raise successfully, the religious voice in the public square today, many
biases, characteristic of "the culture of disbelief" must be overcome.
Professor Carter identifies some:

<OL START=1 TYPE=1>
<LI>the myth that religious people are in some pre-Enlighten-ment
sense, irrational or abnormal - a view very popular amongst psychologists;

<LI>the notion that "God" should be a private hobby - indeed, perhaps
the last private hobby to be indulged in the dark and behind closed doors;

<LI>the myth that faith necessarily leads to political sedition;

<LI>the public willingness to hear the religious voice in support of
liberal political causes but to denounce the religious voice when it speaks
in support of politically incorrect causes;

<LI>the assumption that because the origins and inspiration
for the religious voice are inaccessible to the post-Enlightenment
scientific mind, because found in divine
revelation, that the religious voice is therefore irrelevant;

<LI>the liberal assumption that only economic entitlements and
political rights are important to people today, so that only these may be
discussed in public;

<LI>the myth that because the faith-claims of every faith are both
exclusive and universal, therefore, faiths can never live side-by-side or
engage in interfaith dialogue;

<LI>the assertion that when religious people speak as such in the
public square, they are arrogantly trying to impose their beliefs on
others, but that when those others speak, they are modestly offering some
ideas for public consideration;

<LI>the myth that when religious language is used in public
discourse, it is always, as it so often seems to be in America, phony, and
an attempt to impose some kind of "civil religion" on Canada, which is
vaguely "Protestant" but largely vacuous and platitudinous.
</OL>

<P>Recent liberal political theorists (John Rawls, Bruce Ackerman, Kent
Greenwalt) have argued that when religious people wish to participate in
public debate, they should do so in secular language, providing secular
justifications for the positions urged, although their origins may be
religious.  Such theorists believe that there exist certain moral premises
shared by all persons and that public debate can proceed on the basis of
these premises.  Thus, all participants in the debate should shed their
backgrounds, and just perhaps, their true selves, in order to participate.

<P>On the other hand, Professor Carter has argued that every person should be
free to speak with his or her own voice in the public square - whether that
voice is religious or not.  I agree.  Every person should be permitted to
be themselves in public
discourse as much as in private discourse.  And there may well not be any
fundamental shared moral premises at all.

<P>This requires a psychological re-adjustment to be made in the way in which
we think about religious and other groups, from a position of mere
toleration or accommodation to a position of real equality of voice - a
level playing field.  This means a collective rejection of our current way
of thinking about religions in Canadian society as one where there is a
single majority and a variety of minorities.  With the possible exception
of the Roman Catholic church, which has never got over that 50% hump in the
census statistics, we are all minorities.  A glance at the 1991 Census
shows that there are 84 different religious minorities recorded, as well as
about 4 million unbelievers.

<P>We are a nation of religious minorities.  "Toleration" is, therefore, an
inappropriate concept since it requires not only the existence of a
majority, but also implies on the part of that majority, forbearance,
absence of respect, non-approval and an implicit hope of conversion in
relation to the "tolerated" minorities.  Toleration is a power-word.  In
any case, Toleration is not even a religious virtue, since all faiths worth
their salt profess exclusive and universal access to truth, while
toleration imports lukewarmness and even ab-sence of real belief.

<P>Rather, instead of thinking about religions in terms of toleration or
accommodation, perhaps it is time to jump into a new psychological attitude
and language which respects the exclusive and universal claims of each
religion without public criticism, that is, a language acknowledging an
equality of voices, including religious voices in public discourse.  In any
case, religions are showing no signs of melting away along with capitalism
as Marx had expected, so as a society we might as well get used to its many
voices, as well as the remarkable number of times, many faiths can speak
with one voice on public issues.

<P>The accommodation of religious equality within the public square is more
easily accomplished within the American constitution than our own.  The
First Amendment that, "Congress shall make no law respecting the
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof", was
originally designed to protect religion from the state, rather than the
state from religion.  Today, it is widely interpreted to ensure absolute
state neutrality in its dealing with religious groups, which therefore
enjoy complete equality before the law. The First Amendment constitutes a
voluntary surrender by the state of control over religion.

<P>How differently we have arranged things in Canada.  Our Charter (s.2(a))
guarantees freedom of conscience and religion as a fundamental freedom, but
only if demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society (s.1), as
decided by the judiciary.  It also entrenches privileges for denominational
schools (s. 93 & s. 29) by way of state funding.  Rather than voluntarily
surrendering control over religion, the Canadian constitution grants the
regulation of religion to the courts, which since 1982, have ritually
commented not only that
freedom of religion is far from absolute in Canada, rather is a relative
matter which may be infringed upon in favour of some more pressing policy,
but also that equality of treatment for religions is not mandated by the
Constitution and that again, it is constitutionally permissible to treat
religions unequally in this country.

<P>The First Amendment sustains and nurtures a political environ-
ment in America where religions can be autonomous centres of
moral authority; the Charter subjects them to the power of the
state in Canada.

<P>History presents many examples of the fact that one of the earliest actions
of totalitarian states, once they are fully established, is the abolition
by law of religious freedom and the bringing of religious institutions into
the strangling grip of some department of state. Independent centres of
authority to the state are unwelcome, and
religious centres, drawing as they do on
the deepest and most meaningful experiences and resources available to
humankind are rightly seen as the most subversive force in totalitarian
societies. The gradual eradication of the religious voice from the public
square in Canada should not distract us from the fact of that eradication
and the threat it poses to liberty generally.

<P>Yet, historically, there was no force more intimately related to the
evolution of modern parliamentary democracy than religion.  Those who still
remember the history of that development - with the religion left in - will
recall that religion and religious concerns, were the key issues at every
step along the way of constitutional development.  Religious freedom and
political freedom evolved hand-in-hand.  Freedom of religion is important
not only to those who wish to be religious in late twentieth century
Canada, but it is also essential as  the touchstone for political freedom
and the survival of the truly liberal state - not the socialist state in
liberal disguise as we sometimes appear now to have
in Canada.  The revival of freedom of religion and of the religious voice
in public discourse may well be essential to the re-formulation of the
liberal state on the basis of genuine pluralism and equality.

<P>If we go on as we have recently done, the prospect before us is
truly frightening.

<P>An hour or so ago we began with the Christian refugees from Rome and the
pastoral response to them shown by the greatest father of the church,
Augustine.  Perhaps we might end with another group of
religious refugees and another theologian for refugees who was a refugee
himself.  I hope you will indulge me while I practice what
I have just preached, by relying on a leading theologian of my
own faith community: John Calvin.  Calvin, was with many other French
Protestants, forced to flee the religious persecution
of Protestants which marked the failure of the Reformation in France.  He
finally settled in Geneva along with so many of his fellow
countrymen that the population of the town quadrupled in size in
the space of a few years.

<P>Writing toward the end of his life in the final 1559 edition of the
Institutes of the Christian Religion (IV.20.2).  Calvin described the
proper role for civil states in relation to religion thus:

<P>Civil government has as its appointed end, so long as we live among men, to
cherish and protect the outward worship of God, to defend . . . the
position of the church, to adjust our life to the society of men, to form
our social behavior to civil righteousness, to reconcile us with one
another, and to promote general peace and tranquillity . . . If it is God's
will that we go as pilgrims upon the earth while we aspire to the true
fatherland, and if the pilgrimage requires such help, those who take these
from man deprive him of his very humanity.

<P>Let us hope that the peoples of all faiths in Canada join hands to take
back our common humanity from those who would deprive us of it.

<H2>In Memoriam of George Rawlyk<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4>Christian Historian, Head, Dept. of History, Queen's Univ.<BR>
Member of the Centre's Advisory Council</FONT></H2>

<P>George Rawlyk was Canada's leading scholar of evangelicalism and Canada's
leading Christian historian.  His death on November 23, 1995, from
complications following a car accident, tears a huge hole in the scholarly
and Christian community.  Born in 1935, he was raised in an immigrant home
in Thorold, Ontario.  The decisive moment in his life came in his
conversion to Christ in a Baptist Sunday School.  That fired his
path-breaking scholarship, his radical politics, his loyal church
allegiance and his profound care for, and encouragement to, generations of
graduate students and colleagues.</P>

<P>Rawlyk was best known to many Canadians for his major role in the 1993
"God is Alive!" special issue of Maclean's.  The largest-ever survey of
Canadian religious attitudes produced some strikingly unexpected results,
showing that a far larger proportion of the population holds strongly
Christian beliefs, even though church-going has dropped off steeply since
the 1960s.  This suggested to Rawlyk that much so-called secularization in
Canada affected government institutions and the cultural elite much more
than it did the "Canadian grass roots."<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> Rawlyk had planned to follow
this research with a comparative Canadian-American survey between now and
2000.</P>

<P>A large, rough-hewn, athletic man who almost always wore running shoes,
Rawlyk's career started with a choice between pro-football (he played
centre on a McMaster University team with Russ Jackson as quarterback) and
a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford.  He chose the latter, and while at Oxford,
became president of the Oxford Inter-Collegiate Christian Union.  He
subsequently taught at Queen's University for nearly thirty years.  He was
head of the Department of History from 1976-1985.  He chose to work in
relatively neglected and unpopular fields to demonstrate successfully their
central significance for understanding Canada's past and present.</P>

<P>This meant exploring the his-tory of the Atlantic provinces - he received
an honorary Doctor of Civil Laws degree from Acadia University in October,
1995 - and the history of Christianity in Canada.  In May, 1995, a
first-ever conference held at Queen's on "Aspects of the Canadian
Evangelical Experience" drew scholars from across the country - many of
whom had been his graduate students - and around the world.  McGill-Queen's
Press, for which Rawlyk edited the series "Studies in the History of
Religion," will publish the book of conference papers in 1996.</P>

<P>Increasingly, Rawlyk had ex-plored not just religious groups and events
but also their influence on broader historical movements.  He insisted on
taking seriously the words and actions of participants, especially
ordinary, everyday people, rather than subjecting them to "superior"
academic scrutiny or casting doubt on their sincerity or seriousness.  But
he also traced the lines of their later impact.  He was fascinated, for
instance, with the apparent capacity of Canadian Christians to accommodate
others who differ from them on doctrinal or political grounds, in contrast
with the polarization on such matters that is often evident south of the
border.</P>

<P>Rawlyk was an exponent of what might be called "the new Christian
historiography" developed since the 1970s by historians such as Mark Noll,
Nathan Hatch and George Marsden in the USA and David Bebbington and David
Hempton in the UK [although this list is male, the second generation of
this group includes a number of distinguished women such as Edith Blumhofer
(USA) and Marguerite Van Die (the Canadian)].  Though he started his career
as a Christian, and spent many years studying religious history, it was not
until the 1980s that he came to the "fundamental change of perspective"<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
that made him question his previous approach.  Why not write one's story in
a Christian way?</P>

<P>Rawlyk recognized that how-ever hard one tries to be honest in using
evidence, fair to different interpretation and consistent in one's
conclusions, intellectual work is never neutral.  It is done for particular
purposes and is influenced consciously or unconsciously by assumptions made
by the author.</P>

<P>He never pretended that by doing history Christianly one could thus discern
what is "properly Christian."  But he did believe that forming judgments
and theories of change from a Christian perspective was part of a properly
Christian practice, and one that should be publicly accessible to believer
and unbeliever alike.</P>

<P>Rawlyk will also be remembered for his loyal-but-critical attachments to
First Baptist Church in Kingston, to the New Democratic Party - he once
campaigned with the NDP leader Ed Broadbent - and to Queen's University.
Needless to say, Rawlyk was sometimes involved in controversy.  While he
held his ground tenaciously, he could also see another person's
perspective, as well as their debating points, and, over time, modify his
views.</P>

<P>At Queen's, students, above all, nurture fond memories of him.  He was
well-known for the open door to his office - although students also knew
not to bother him unless their visit had a purpose - and for the care and
concern shown to each person, especially if he or she were anxious, hard-up
or harassed.  He was known for his support of female professors in a
male-dominated academic environment.  As a colleague, I found him always as
interested in my family situation - he was himself married
with two grown daughters - as he was in my work.</P>

<P>As universities come under increasing pressure to rationalize and
restructure, the example of persons such as George Rawlyk will become
central as a beacon of hope.  To have the courage of one's convictions, to
passionately promote scholarship and social justice, to create communities
rather than pursue self-interest, to be genuinely concerned about daily
life realities of relationships and, in his case, to be a candidly
committed Christian, are traits seldom found in one person.  Simply, he was
the salt of the earth.<BR></P>

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>

<P>Throughout history the relationship between the state and the family and
the role and duties assigned to each has been much debated.  Some have seen
the family as a servant of the state while others have seen the state's
role as essentially to provide families with the security they need to do
their work as the primary unit for raising children as future citizens.  In
his book, The Socialist Phenomenon (New York: Harper & Row, 1980), Igor
Shafarevich, once a professor of mathematics at Moscow University,
catalogued the historic tendencies of a certain type of utopian socialism
which sought a perfected or utopian state  it believed could be achieved if
only society was restructured in certain ways.  Shafarevich traced this
type of socialism through antiquity, the heresies of the Middle Ages and
the Reformation, the utopian writings of philosophers such as More and
Campanella, the state socialism of  the Inca Empire, the 18th Century
Jesuit state in Paraguay and the ancient Orient.   Over this wide expanse
of time and place, Shafarevich noted three trajectories common to utopian
restructuring: the abolition of  private property, the abolition of
religion and the abolition of the family.  One does not need to become
paranoid in order to notice that in Canada today these three institutions
are, in fact, under considerable strain.  Particularly with respect to the
family, there are signs that it is once again time to renew the discussion
about the proper role of the family in a free and democratic society.

<P>There is always a  tension between the state and the parts that
make it up.  The state and its institutions must always be careful to
facilitate the function of the family without usurping its proper role.
The state has a role to play in ensuring that the lives of children are not
threatened by neglect or abuse but must be careful not to tread on the
independence of the family.  The state exists, so the principle of
subsidiarity tells us, to facilitate and assist the smaller units, not to
occupy their proper "space" in society.

<P>In past decades, ideological camps have arisen which have called,
on occasion, for the abolition of any demarcation between the family and
the state.  This idea, as old as Plato, threatens the notion that the
family is, and ought to be,  the first "school of virtue" for citizens.
Unfortunately, as virtue itself has slowly evaporated from consciousness (a
result of its gradual disappearance from formal education itself), the
family's role in the teaching and propagation of a coherent understanding
of virtue and character has also become misty.  When key aspects of social
life cease to be argued for, debated and taught,  it is only a question of
time before they become threatened by acts of commission or by neglect.

<P>There is growing evidence that this tension between the state and
family may be in need of examination and correction at this time.  Such
correction will involve, as part of its task, the re-articulation of the
family, its nature and its proper place in civil society.  If this task of
description or re-membering does not occur, there is a risk that those who
seek deliberately to weaken the family will triumph, not because their
arguments are better but because the rest have lost any sense of what the
family's proper role and duties are and how to argue for them.  But, prior
to any proper prescription, one must first be convinced that the diagnosis
is sound.

<P>In this paper Vancouver lawyer Cindy Silver, who has followed
developments in this area for some years, has chosen to examine the effects
of recent development in national and international law that touch on the
issue of "family autonomy".  She notes the importance of seeking "the best
interests of the child" in certain circumstances but sounds a note of
warning lest the ambit of such inquiries extend beyond those where the
lives of children are actually at stake.  It is not the state's place, for
example, to make determinations about the religious education a child gets
from its family nor should a family's religious beliefs be a relevant
factor in "child apprehension" cases.   It will come as a considerable
shock to some people to realize that just this sort of inquiry has occurred
in Canada in recent years.

<P>We do not need to subscribe to the view that the family is under
threat of imminent abolition in Canada in order to decide that it is time
to start asking some hard questions.  First amongst these are questions
that relate to how we are to protect family autonomy in a society that is
given over more and more to forms of state control and state regulation
that allow less and less scope for the exercise of meaningful family
autonomy.   It is useful to reflect, for example, on whether parents in
Canada at the present time have an effective choice about the type of
curriculum their children are going to be taught from in systems supported
by their own tax dollars.  How accountable is the public school system and
what can be done to make it effectively accountable?   While these
questions are not dealt with in this paper, they arise when its central
theme is considered more broadly.  Effective family autonomy is not
something we can take for granted even within existing institutions in
Canada and, as Silver shows in her paper, there is now a sufficient basis
in documented cases for politicians and policy makers to take positive
steps to ensure that valid concerns about the welfare of children are not
used in ways which inject the state and the courts into areas they have no
proper place to enter.

<P>Considerable work will be necessary in the future if we are to
discover what aspects of  civil society need to be strengthened so that
families will have the resources they need.  It is hoped that by showing
some key recent developments that touch on the place of  family autonomy in
Canadian society, this paper will contribute to a broader discussion of
the issues so that the state and the family can begin to occupy their
proper places.

<H1><I>"Tis the Season... for RRSP's!"</I>
<HR WIDTH=75% ALIGN=left SIZE=8 NOSHADE></H1>
<H4>By Rob Redman, CMA</H4><BR>

<P>That's right, for all those of you who are guilty of procrastinating on your RRSP contributions, get moving now or lose out for 1995.  Since their introduction in 1957, RRSP's have become the single most
important vehicle for long term investing in Canada.  For the 1994 tax year over 5.3 million Canadians
contributed over $20.9 billion to their RRSP's.  Now over half of all Canadian households own at least one
RRSP.  These numbers are up substantially from even a few year ago, but how do you rate?</P>

<P>As much as we may take them for granted, RRSP's are most likely the best program available in any
country in the world for the "average person" to accumulate significant wealth.  If you think about it, we
really do have it pretty good.  We can make contributions to our own investment portfolios that are tax
deductible.  The portfolio is completely under our own control and we can even invest outside of our
country, and  yet the money still grows tax deferred.  Sure there are limits on how much we can put in,
and the withdrawal rules are a little cumbersome, but where else in the world could you find such a tax
advantaged way to save for your retirement?<IMG SRC="./gifs/hrglass.gif" WIDTH=194 HEIGHT=382 ALIGN=right></P>

<P>There was an interesting article  in the Financial Post in December that discussed a poll that Royal Trust had done regarding RRSP's.  Apparently about 49% of the poll respondents planned to put money into
RRSP's this year.  Of all those people who will make contributions, only 28% plan on using some foreign
content.  The average contribution this year will be $4,049, which doesn't look like much, but that's up
about 10% from last year, and the average RRSP account is worth $30,102.</P>

<P>Now you can rank yourself versus those figures, if you want to, but those don't tell the whole story.  In the same poll some shocking figures were revealed.  Given all of the positive numbers above, 24% of all
respondents still expect their standard of  living to fall in retirement.  19 % expect the Canada Pension
Plan to go bust by the time  they retire and 11% are concerned about ill health and the rising cost of
medical care.  If this is the case it would  seem only logical for people to avail themselves of some
financial expertise to help them meet their objectives.  Although this may be true, 68% of all respondents
have never met with a financial advisor and 41% have never made an RRSP contribution.</P>

<P>I guess the lesson is, to take care of yourself because nobody else will.  If you know someone who could
use our assistance in getting their plan underway, please feel free to  have them give us a call.  If you
care about them, you'll recommend them to a skilled group of professionals.  In terms of your own plans,
make sure you call us soon if you need to get in before February 29th. </P>

<H1><I>Will your retirement plans become a reality?</I>
<HR WIDTH=75% ALIGN=left SIZE=8 NOSHADE></H1>
<H4>By Allan Weiss</H4><BR>

<P>You've been saving for retirement for years--putting money into your registered retirement savings plans, perhaps on a monthly basis, perhaps annually. On the other hand, if money has been in short supply,
you've been delaying, but "next year for sure" you'll make a contribution. What happens if you're disabled
before your retirement plan is built? If you're like most people who have employment or business income,
you may have some group or private disability benefits that will pay you. Unfortunately, such benefits will
in all likelihood be used entirely to meet ongoing living expenses and other needs, and your RSP contribution room, based as it is on "earned income", will be at best reduced. It's highly unlikely that you'll
have anything left to put away towards retirement.</P>

<P>There are solutions available. Either as a separate policy or as a rider to a more complete disability policy, you can obtain a guarantee that your retirement assets will grow as you planned:  an arrangement that will continue to accumulate an investment pool for you, in the event that you become disabled. The plan is flexible, permanent, non-cancellable, and guaranteed, and the cost is surprisingly affordable. Contact us for further details.</P>

<CENTER>*************************MEMO***************************</CENTER>


<P>To: The Canadian Charter Banks</P>

<P>From: Peter B. Fraser</P>

<P>Please be aware that your introduction into the life insurance and "real world" mutual fund business has introduced the need for a great deal of responsibility on your parts.</P>

<P>Some of us in the financial planning profession welcome your acquisition of these products for two
reasons:</P>

<P>1. Canadians still append a significant degree of credibility to any product or strategy sanctioned by their banks. So your handling of life insurance and the most  widely recognized mutual funds will serve to
enhance the overall perception of these products. Thank you because that helps us, your competitor too.</P>

<P>2. Competition, that is, good, fair and balanced competition is wholesome and ultimately best for the
buying public. Your entry will not only keep us on our toes but striving to stay ahead of you in value and
performance.</P>

<P>I do caution you however not to assume that Canadians will line up for a dose of these products just
because you suddenly have them in your collection along with mortgages, car loans, lines of credit and
the like. Our experience is that people are really seeking a quality, compassion-filled relationship.</P>

<P>Life insurance and mutual funds are not bought over the counter after a 12 minute wait between the velvet railings. People who are serious and intent on learning to do better with what they have need more than the 2 - 3 minutes they can eke out of the transactional time allotted to them when the arrow goes on
pointing them to the next teller. They want a financial planner who will work FOR them, not do something
TO them.</P>

<P>Only a commitment to quality, servant-hearted relationships will do the trick here. Canadians will
participate vigorously when invited to do so and after having been thoroughly equipped and well taught.
So get your teaching cloaks on and be prepared.</P>

<P>I urge you to be credible, compassionate, self-less and laser-beam focussed on your customers' real
long-term needs, not only your banks' bottom line. As for us in the independent financial planning
segment, we'll see you at the finish line because we're in this for the long term.</P>

<P>As financial planners at P. B. Fraser & Associates, we continually encourage our clients to tell us their
feelings on what we do right for them, as well as what can be improved upon. One of the recurring concerns we heard during 1995 was a wish to have more direct access to a wider range of products. More
than ever before, the average Canadian understands, at an instinctive level, that it's important to diversify
one's personal assets. As a result, people are looking with a more inquisitive and critical eye at what's
available in the financial marketplace. Mutual funds, guaranteed investment certificates and insurance
products have been relatively easy for us to provide. We have long recognized that access to bonds and
stocks is also important.</P>

<P>We are pleased to have taken some bold steps to service your needs. These are only first steps, and
many more are planned for development during the next few months.</P>

<P><B>Bonds-</B> Through our licencing dealer, we have entered into a strategic affiliation with the brokerage firm Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion, which is owned by the National Bank. We now have on-line access to current bond pricing throughout the trading day. Beginning now, you can buy strip-bonds, provincial and government of Canada long-term bonds over $20,000 within self-directed RSP's. Other fixed income products and bond purchases for open accounts will be available in the near future.</P>

<P><B>Stocks-</B> We are involved in the incorporation of a new management company which will serve to provide our financial planners with the tools necessary to be involved in the purchase and sale of stocks. A Vice-President of Research has been hired to develop this market for your availability. Further news will
be forthcoming in the next few months. The benefits to this will be the:</P>

<P>*  direct purchase of stocks for your portfolios, and<BR>
*  discretionary portfolio management.</P>

<P>We are proud to be affiliated with a group as progressive as Balanced Planning. The opportunity to have input into their plans is something we value greatly because this input comes from YOU. Thank you for
your continued support of P. B. Fraser & Associates and for your frankness and candor in sharing your
advice and concerns.</P>

<H4>By Chris Johnson</H4><BR>

<P>Looking at a general economic overview of Canada we can see some evidence that the fiscal restraints
being implemented by the federal and provincial governments are showing some positive effects on the
markets. Lower interest rates, a stronger Canadian dollar, a strong domestic stock market and low
inflation are all signs that our fiscal reform is being taken seriously.</P>

<P>Equity Markets: <BR>
1995 was a good year for the Canadian stock market. The performance we saw throughout the year
shows good quality growth based on fundamentals, increased corporate profits, low inflation and solid
commodity prices. These increases are not resulting in an "overheated" market. This will allow for another
good year in the Canadian stock markets offering opportunity for investors to find the returns they seek.</P>

<P>One thing we must be cautious about is the US stock market. Differing opinions say anything from the
U.S. hitting dangerous levels, to a restructuring of the way business is being done resulting in the
strongest bull market in years. The Canadian market does follow the U.S. market and if the U.S. stays
out of trouble (and it should) , we will be in good shape for 1996. Continuing to buy quality companies and
holding them remains a sound strategy that should pay dividends this year.</P>

<P>Fixed Income Markets:<BR>
1996 will be different from 1995. We saw a spike in short term rates during the early part of 1995 that
created opportunity for professional managers to realize some great gains over the course of the year.
At the present level there is not much room for further declines in interest rates and it is suspected that
this will hold true for most of 1996. This means that one should not expect much more than the interest
on bonds over the next 12 months. It will be unlikely that there will be any growth from capital gains in
bonds and bond funds. As the referendum approached we saw an increase in the spread between
Canada and US interest rates as our political instability  made us more of a risk to investors. With the
resulting NO vote we have seen this spread shrink back to almost normal levels.</P>

<P>We advise investors in the fixed income markets to focus on short to medium term investments. This
takes away some of the risk should short term interest rates increase again. When investing be sure to
examine <B>all</B> your options and do not make a decision on what something <B>did</B> over the last 12 months.</P>

<H1><I>Power of Attorney or Public Guardian and Trustee - Your Choice</I>
<HR WIDTH=92% ALIGN=left SIZE=8 NOSHADE></H1>
<H4>By Mitchell Besner</H4><BR>

<P>Did you know that if you become incapacitated and have not executed a Continuing Power of Attorney,
you will have to rely on the Public Guardian and Trustee of Ontario to manage your pressing financial
affairs?  Your financial planner has very good reasons for advising you that a Power of Attorney is an
essential element of a comprehensive estate plan.</P>

<P>The goal of a Continuing Power of Attorney (the term "Continuing" refers to the fact that you want the
Power of Attorney to continue throughout the period that you are incapacitated) is to delegate the power
to make decisions on your behalf to someone of your choice, who will be called your attorney.  Your
attorney may be your spouse, a relative, trusted friend or trust company, or some combination of such
parties.  Either in your Continuing Power of Attorney or the letter of direction to your lawyer that should
accompany this document, you  will limit the circumstances under which your Continuing Power of
Attorney can be used; generally, to the loss of the ability to act for yourself, whether due to illness or
injury.</P>

<P>You also specify the types of decisions that you want your attorney to make on your behalf.  Matters of
personal care, such as the consent to medical treatment, are properly kept separate from those dealing
with your financial affairs.  You can cover these decisions in a document called a Power of Attorney for
Personal Care.  Perhaps a subsequent article can deal with this type of Power of Attorney.  Now I would
like to focus on the Power of attorney which governs your financial affairs, formally called the Continuing
Power of Attorney for Property.</P>

<P>Under the new law in Ontario, which came into effect on April 3,1995, if you become incapacitated and
do not have a valid Continuing Power of Attorney, the Public Guardian and Trustee of Ontario (the PGT)
will step in and take over the management of your financial affairs.  Your next of kin would then have to
apply to the PGT to replace it as what is called your Statutory Guardian of Property.  This application will
have to be supported by, amongst other things, a management plan and an undertaking to provide
security to the PGT.  As our population ages and the resources of the PGT become stretched beyond
their limitations, this procedure, in addition to being costly, could take months; in the interim an
over-burdened PGT would be responsible for managing your day-to-day financial affairs.</P>

<P>On the other hand, if you have a Continuing Power of Attorney, your attorney simply needs to obtain an
original or notarized copy of that document.  He or she will then be able to act on your behalf and do such
things as pay your bills, renew your mortgage and provide instructions to your financial planner.  The only
thing you cannot delegate to your attorney is the power to sign a new Last Will and Testament.</P>

<P>Only if you are certified as incapable of managing your property under the Mental Health Act will a
Continuing Power of Attorney not prevent the PGT from getting involved in your affairs.  But that is only
in the short term.  If you have a pre-existing Continuing Power of Attorney, the person named as attorney
would be in a much better position to take over the management of your affairs from the PGT than would
your next of kin if you did not have one.  For example, your appointed attorney would not have to submit
a management plan or prove to the PGT that he or she is a suitable replacement.  As well, the PGT would
be bound by law to approve  your attorney's application within thirty days from the date your attorney
submits his or her application, unless the PGT has reasonable grounds to believe that you were not
mentally capable at the time you signed the Continuing Power of Attorney.</P>

<P>Preparing a Continuing Power of Attorney for Property is an inexpensive way to ensure that if you are not able to care for yourself, your financial affairs will be handled expeditiously by the person or persons of
your choice.</P>

<H4>By Allan Weiss.</H4><BR>

<P>No doubt you've all had your T.V. time interrupted, at one point or another, by advertisements from an insurance company which shall remain nameless (but  whose initials are N.U.), offering life insurance with no medical examination required.  At first glance, this may look like a great deal, but even on the basis of common sense alone, you know there has to be a catch somewhere.  Why would an insurance company
take on the risk of insuring someone whose medical history is a complete unknown?  Obviously, the venture must somehow be profitable.  As insurance is a field that is highly competitive, and likely to become more so in future, logic alone would suggest two conclusions:</P>

<P>1.  The amount of insurance  offered is relatively small, and,</P>
<P>2.  The premiums would be at the higher end of the price range.</P>

<P>This in fact turns out to be the reality of the situation.  But what if you have a major health condition that you think might make you uninsurable?  Should you rush to the phone?  Once again, there's really no free lunch;  if you die within two years of purchasing the policy, my reading of the situation is that your estate or beneficiary receives only 1.5 times the premiums you paid--not the full death benefit.</P>

<P>The obvious conclusion is this:  if you think you need insurance, get your advisor to get you one or more price quotations from good companies, and apply for a policy.  The application alone obligates you to
nothing whatsoever.  The chances are that you will be accepted for a policy, and the price may be less
than you think.  Even if you have a health problem, this does not often result in an outright refusal.  Usually,
you'll be "rated", meaning that you'll have to pay a higher premium, to compensate the insurance company
for the added risk they're incurring by accepting you as a client--but you'll still have your coverage.  If you
don't like the end result, you need not accept the policy, but at least you'll have the satisfaction of knowing
that you "did your homework", and in all likelihood you'll end up with a better policy than if you had simply
responded to a mass marketing ploy.</P>

<P>If you'd like to read more on this topic, I have in my possession an interesting article from a 1993 edition of the Financial Post.  Feel free to call me for a copy.</P>

<br>
To our friends, loyal IT&E customers, and other long-distance users:
<br><br>
Hafa Adai!
<br><br>
&#09;We at IT&E just wanted to let you know that there are a few changes in store for your off-island telephone dialing in 1997.  These changes, mandated by the Federal government, are designed to bring Guam into the North American Dialing Plan.  You will be hearing a lot of new terms over the next few months like <b><i>equal access, presubscription, and balloting</i></b>.  
So we thought you may want to learn what these words mean, and perhaps answer any other questions you may have as well.
<br><br>
&#09;For you, the telephone user, all the changes will basically boil down to one point:  you will need to select a "primary carrier" to use for all your long distance calls.
<br><br>
Confused?  That's okay.  IT&E has prepared this simple guide to answer frequently asked questions.  We hope that these Q&A's help to clarify things,
but if you have other questions, please call us at 646-8886.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Frequently asked questions and answers:</h1>
<FONT COLOR=0000A0><b>What will Equal Access mean to me?</b></FONT>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equal Access means that you will need to pick one "primary carrier" for all your direct-dialed, off-island telephone calls.
<br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR=0000A0><b>What is a presubscription ballot?</b></FONT>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presubscription is your chance to "vote" for a preferred carrier.  GTA will soon be sending you a presubscription ballot to cast your vote.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you receive the ballot, simply fill in the box next to IT&E and return the ballot as instructed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or call IT&E at 646-8886.  One of our friendly cutomer service representatives will gladly assist you.
<br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR=0000A0><b>Will this change how my phone works?</b></FONT>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the most part, no.  You will operate your phone exactly the same as before.  Dialing off-island, however, will be a little bit different.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting July 1, 1997, you will only need to dial "1" plus the area code and number on calls to all points.  To dial other countries, you will dial 011+country code+telephone number.
<br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR=0000A0><b>When will I receive the presubscription ballot?</b></FONT>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GTA, through its agent NCS, will mail you a ballot at the end of March 1997.  You will have about 30 days to complete and return this ballot by mail.  For your convenience, you may return your ballot to any of IT&E's offices around the island.  We will also be happy to assist you in completing your ballot and answering any questions you may have.
<br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR=0000A0><b>Is there anything that I have to do?</b></FONT>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make sure that you continue to receive IT&E's high quality service at our low rates, you should choose IT&E on your presubscription ballot.
<br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR=0000A0><b>What if I fail to submit a ballot?</b></FONT>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't worry.  A second ballot will be mailed out in May 1997, giving you a second chance to choose IT&E.  Or you can simply stop by an IT&E office or call us.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you fail to complete either ballot or consult with your IT&E agent,  GTA will randomly assign you a primary long distance carrier that may not meet your needs.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is very important that you make your choice and return the ballot on time.  If you wish, IT&E will be happy to assist you in completing and returning your ballot.  Simply drop by any of our IT&E offices or call us.
<br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR=0000A0><b>Is there another way of making my selection?</b></FONT>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you may drop by IT&E's office and we will provide you with a <A HREF="loainfo.htm">Letter of Agency (LOA)</A>.  This LOA authorizes IT&E to act as an agent on your behalf
for the sole purpose of presubscribing your telephone number(s) to IT&E.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, you may also stop by GTA's business office and complete what's called a "super ballot."  For example, if you decide to use IT&E as your carrier, simply identify that in the ballot and sign it.
<br>
<br><FONT COLOR=0000A0>
<b>Why should I choose IT&E?</b></FONT>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT&E has a solid reputation for superior quality, service, and value.  For example, by using IT&E you will:
<UL>
<LI>receive the lowest rates without sacrificing quality
<LI>receive the highest and most flexible discount calling plans
<LI>be connected to unlimited destinations worldwide
<LI>receive 24-hour operator service assistance
<LI>be offered the IT&E/AT&T Power Card which makes calling possible worldwide
<LI>be directly connected to AT&T, KDD Japan, PLDT Phillippines, as well as other major carriers
<LI>have access to IT&E's Internet, Video Conference, Switch 56, and many other value-added services
</UL>

<FONT COLOR=0000A0><b>If I select IT&E today, how can I be assured the greatest benefits?</b></FONT>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to providing the best service, only IT&E today gives you the lowest overall rates.  With a 
combination like that, you always win!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, our successful fourteen-year track record on Guam is your solid guarantee that you can get the 
biggest benefits only from IT&E, today and in the years to come.
<br>
<br>
<b><FONT COLOR=0000A0>So sign up today with IT&E, because...</FONT></b>

Local weather forecasting services are available from several local media sources.  The <STRONG>U. S.

Recorded weather forecasts for Guam with coastal marine conditions are available by local telephone at 711, 477-2991 or 477-5992.

The equatorial belt in the tropics is the only place on our planet where eight of the ten brightest stars

<BR>
There has been a lot of publicity regarding the apparent depletion of the Ozone layer by residual 
chemicals in the upper atmosphere.  This was first observed by the <A HREF="http://www.nbs.ac.uk/public/icd/ozone_pub/index.html" target="_parent">  British Antarctic Society</A> Home Page which gives an explanation of this phenomena.  NASA has been monitoring levels of ozone and other chemicals in the upper atmosphere and has an excellant Fact Page which describes <A HREF="http://spso.gsfc.nasa.gov/NASA_FACTS/ozone/ozone.html" target="_parent">what Ozone is and why do we care?</A> 
There is also an activist perspective which is detailed in the <A HREF="http://www.essential.org/orgs/Ozone_Action/1.html" target="_parent">
 Ozone Action </A>Home Page.  Click on the photo at left to view a copy of the comparison of satellite photos showing the progression of Ozone levels from 1979 to 1994.  The long term effects of this situation are not yet clear.  These sites are where the most recent information is available on the subject.  Thought you might like to know.<BR>

On the first Friday of every month, join IT&E at the Tamuning location for a Parking Lot Party where you can get
free food and drinks. Why fight the traffic when you can stop in, grab a bite to eat, find out about IT&E's latest rates
and register to win great raffle prizes, including that dream house and lot! Even if you can't stop by, give us a happy honk of the
horn and wave back as we are out by the roadside saying "Hi!" to all of our great customers! We'll see you on the first Friday of each month at the
IT&E office in Tamuning for our Parking Lot Party!

<FONT SIZE=-1><A NAME="1979">1979</A> - Three innovative entrepreneurs join forces to form IT&E Corp: Jose D. Perez, John M. 
Borlas, and Jaime F. Tuquero.  IT&E focused on the sale and installation of business telephone systems.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="1983">1983</A> - IT&E begins its long distance operations offering direct dialing service to domestic points with rates reduced over 47% lower than its competitor.  IT&E, with its innovative approach, captured a major share of the domestic-bound markets, which divided the monopoly once held by the competition for over 30 years.<BR>
<BR> 
<A NAME="1985">1985</A> - IT&E introduces direct dialing service to international points at greatly reduced rates.<BR>
<BR> 
<A NAME="1986">1986</A> - Opening of IT&E Saipan office and began offering business telephone systems and long distance 
services.<BR>
<BR> 
<A NAME="1989">1989</A> - IT&E opens its first international gateway switching center allowing IT&E to achieve parity as a service 
provider with other telecommunications giants such as AT&T and MCI.  IT&E secures direct-service correspondent 
agreements with AT&T, KDD in Japan, PLDT in the Philippines, and DACOM in Korea extending its coverage to 
more than 280 countries and areas worldwide.<BR>
<BR> 
<A NAME="1990">1990</A> - IT&E and AT&T collaborate to offer the ECONO-CHARGE card, a joint long-distance telephone card allowing
 consumers to make long distance phone calls while traveling in Hawaii, the continental U.S. and other international 
destinations.<BR>
<BR> 
<A NAME="1992">1992</A> - IT&E becomes the first long-distance company on Guam and Saipan  to launch a long-distance discount plan. 
The Volume Incentive Plan (VIP) offered consumers automatic volume discounts.<BR>
<BR> 
<A NAME="1993">1993</A> - IT&E celebrates its 10th  Anniversary.  Also introduces the Right Plan, where double digit automatic savings
 are given to calls that cost the most.  IT&E installs its second gateway, a $5 million dollar AT&T digital international 
gateway switching system, the 5ESS paving the way for new technological benefits for Guam.<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1996">1996</A> - IT&E, today, continues to be Guams only locally owned, full service long distance telephone company.  IT&E 
credits the hardworking efforts of its employees who have kept the customer  first in all aspects of operations.  It is
 this innovative spirit and direction that will keep IT&E a forerunner in the telecommunications industry in the years 
to come.<BR><BR></FONT>

<IMG SRC="images/mcbullet.gif" HSPACE=5> I will not give out personal information such as my address, telephone number, parents' work address/telephone number, 
or the name and location of my school without my parents' permission.
<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="images/mcbullet.gif" HSPACE=5> I will tell my parents right away if I come across any information that makes me feel uncomfortable.
<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="images/mcbullet.gif" HSPACE=5>I will never agree to get together with someone I &quot;meet&quot; online without first checking with my parents. If my parents agree 
to the meeting, I will be sure that it is in a public place and bring my mother or father along.
<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="images/mcbullet.gif" HSPACE=5>
I will never send a person my picture or anything else without first checking with my parents.
<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="images/mcbullet.gif" HSPACE=5>I will not respond to any messages that are mean or in any way make me feel uncomfortable. It is not my fault if I get a 
message like that. If I do I will tell my parents right away so that they can contact the service provider.
<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="images/mcbullet.gif" HSPACE=5>I will talk with my parents so that we can set up rules for going online. We will decide upon the time of day that I can be 
online, the length of time I can be online, and appropriate areas for me to visit. I will not access other areas or break these rules without their permission.

<P>
<STRONG><B><BIG>So you've got this burning urge to see your name in Cyberspace. </BIG></B> You want your own web page.  Take my advice, don't do it.  There are over 50 million Web Pages out there already and growing.   More than 20,000 domain sites are added each day with dozens to hundreds of new pages in each domain.  Frankly, you could spend the rest of your life browsing through the Web and hardly scratch the surface.  The quantity of human knowledge already on the Web, or accessible through it, is staggering. But you don't care, this is your chance to debut before the whole world...<P>

<B><BIG>Look Mom, no hands!</BIG></B>  If you are going to the trouble and effort to make your own Web site, then (for our sake) put some thought into what you want to say.  Start with some reason why anyone, besides your mom, would want to visit your site.  If you can think of one or two, then by all means, do it.  Let's focus on some basics.  The World Wide Web is graphical.  It's possible to cruise the Web with a text browser, and remember the way the Web was.  But why bother?  The analogy is like going to a Hollywood premiere wearing earplugs and a blindfold. Yeah, the popcorn tastes good and you can feel the gum on the seat, but you're missing the big picture. Consider the really cool site sponsored by the Vatican that shows Michaelangelo's paintings in the Sistine Chapel (<A HREF="http://www.christusrex.org/">Christus Rex et Redemptor Mundi</A>).  Would you be satisfied to read a
bunch of scholarly writings on renaissance murals or would you prefer to have it as garnish for a beautiful collection of 325 photos of the famed chapel?  So we'll assume you'll be making Web pages intended to be seen as well as read.  Now to begin your quest, seek the holy grail of HTML...<P>

<A NAME="HTML"></A>
<B><BIG>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). </BIG></B>The command structure of the Web is based on Unix.  PC and Mac operating systems are based on a subset of the command structure of Unix. Unix was chosen to provide the basic building blocks for the Internet primarily because it was written as a multi-platform open operating system and was supported by the large mainframe computers which dominated the landscape in the early days of computing.  The actual documents or "Web Pages" float on top of the operating system and are viewed through a browser which binds with the operating system on one hand, and interprets and displays the Web Pages on the other. Web pages are written in a simplified language that is a subset of SGML (Standard Graphical Markup Language), known as HTML.  HTML is a set of formatting specifications which consist of a set of simple bracketed commands, or "tags", which are embedded within the HTML file (Web Page). With wider acceptance, the HTML standard has been under increasing pressure to improve by adding new capabilities.  As more complex functions are added to the Web by the dominate browser makers, the actual specification is evolving much more rapidly than the current published standards adopted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  The W3C, the group responsible for setting HTML standards, has a long-standing motto: "We don't believe in Kings, Presidents, or voting; only rough consensus and running code". So far, Netscape has been making the best code and with 80% of the Web using Netscape Navigator, they set the de facto standard.  At present, HTML 2.0 is the current reference standard, and HTML 3.0 is under debate.  Many of the features proposed for HTML 3.0 have already been incorporated within the more popular web browsers and are usually referred to as HTML 2+ or HTML 3+ enhancements.  Now that you know enough to be a caller on the Practical Computing Show, lets get to it....<P>

<B><BIG>Home Page. </BIG></B> A home page is a starting point for your Web masterpiece.  The best part about the Web is that you can finally afford the home of your dreams. However, whole point of creating a page is to communicate your message.  The first step is to prepare, in rough form, the text, images and layout desired, as well as, the external documents (Web pages) you want to link to and any "mailto:" addresses you'd like to offer your readers.  The images must be in screen format (either GIF or JPEG format at 72 dpi resolution).  For your first time up at bat, keep it simple with one or two images.  Okay, time to get serious, you'll need some tools for this trip.....<P>

<B><BIG><A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">The NCSA Home Page.</A></BIG></B>  The original graphical browser is Mosaic, written at NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications) at the University of Illinois at Urbana.  Their Web site contains most of the documentation you need to get started with HTML editing and lot's of good answers for the newbie user.  Check out <A HREF="http://union.ncsa.uiuc.edu:80/HyperNews/get/www/html/guides.html"> Guides to Writing HTML Documents</A> for links to all of the current HTML reference standards and great how-to information.  HTML Writer's Guild (http://www.synet.net/hwg/index.html) is another gold mine of information on Web Page authoring. Two of the authors of the Mosaic program left the academic fold at NCSA and founded Netscape Communications, a public corporation that markets Netscape Navigator and other Web software. Their <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/">Home Page</A> (http://home.netscape.com/) is worth visiting for the links to numerous resources on Web Page authoring and running server sites on the Internet.  They have provided enormous momentum in the expansion of the Web.  An announced version is scheduled to ship in March which will include HTML editing functions. <P>

<A NAME="Instant Home Page"></A>
<B><BIG>Instant Home Page.  </BIG></B><A HREF="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/">Writing HTML</A> is a site that coaches you on how to make your own Home Page.  This is a very good on-line tutor, but remember, you're paying for connect time.  Writing HTML won't make you an expert, but it will teach you the basics of building a solid homepage.  BestSeller has a number of novice HTML books in stock, some include basic HTML editors and tutorials. If you've gotten this far and are still convinced this is for you, my advice is to visit some sites, download an editor and try your hand at composing a few pages.  You can get a look at source code (a cool word for an HTML document) by opening a Web page with your favorite browser and saving it as "source".  Open any text editor to look at working code.  But this is primitive when you can get yourself a Web editor.... download one of the following packages and go through their built-in tutorial. <P>


<A NAME="EDITORS"></A>
<B><BIG>Editors.</BIG></B>  <A HREF="http://www.sq.com/">HoTMetal Pro</A>, <A HREF="http://www.nesbitt.com/">WebEdit</A>, <A HREF="http://www.sausage.com">HotDog Pro</A>, and <A HREF="http://lal.cs.byu.edu/people/nosack/">HTML Writer</A> are very powerful editors all of which support the HTML 3.0 standards.   Most are "downloadable" for a free 30 day trial run. At the end of the evaluation period, a software lock prevents program access until you have registered the software.  Their are at least a dozen editors available on the Web last time I looked.  Check out <A HREF="http://union.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HyperNews/get/www/html/editors.html"> Mag's Big List of HTML Editors</A>.   If your a Mac fiend on a tight budget, try the freeware program <A HREF="http://ogopogo.nttc.edu/tools/HTMLedit/HTMLedit.html">HTML.edit</A>.   After selecting an editor, the tutorial or instructions will explain the HTML tags  that are supported and how they are activated.  Most of the editors have a Home Page wizard which will help you break the ice. All editors will support images in Compuserve's GIF format, some allow JPEG format, which compresses larger pictures into a smaller file size with some loss of detail.  Text can be formatted as headings, simple statements or paragraphs.  The most powerful features of HTML lie in the capability to "link" or "anchor" text and images to points within the document or other, external documents.  It is this linkage capability that gives the Web it's name. Web Page composition is a topic we'll have to cover later. When your Web page is done you can check it out on a verification site to ensure it's composed according to the rules.  At that point, contact someone with a Web server  and have them hang your page out for all the  world to see.

IT&E has made significant investments in the Fiber-Optic Network that spans the Pacific.  Communications traffic to and from Guam is routed primarily via fiber optic cables. With satellite circuits accommodating the overflow and with the completion of the Transpacific cable #5, IT&E is excited with it's investment into TPC5.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>TPC5</STRONG> is a self-healing system that is expected to answer an ever-growing demand for continued quality telecommunication service to Japan, Hawaii, the U.S. mainland, and ultimately connecting to the world. TPC5 has not only one,
but two pairs of cables.  The first, the Service Fiber Pair, is the main connection.  Should that system fail, traffic is automatically rerouted to the Restoration Fiber Pair, resulting in uninterruptable service.  The PacRim West cable network is the first direct connection from Guam to Australia and the South Pacific. In years past, telecommunications to Australia were connected through a U.S. mainland route.<BR>

<STRONG>SDI</STRONG> is a high speed, 56KB alternative to international private lines. It is the first fully digital, dial up 56 Kbps service from Guam to the U.S. and international locations and is the first service to use the international achitecture, including CCITT #7 Signaling Protocol.  SDI is the international extension of the domestic AT&T Accunet Switched Digital Service.

True to its reputation for being Guam's telecommunications leader, IT&E once again charges forward first and introduces new,
reduced long distance rates.
<br>
<br>
Effective March 1, 1997, Guam's only locally-owned, full-service long distance telecommunications company introduces the 
<i>new</i> Right Plan, complete with across-the-board savings for all direct dial long distance calling all week long, on all
numbers you call, all the time and to all locations.
<br>
<br>
Plus, calling long distance with IT&E is now just a matter of seconds, so to speak, in that rates are based on six second increments.
That means you're only charged for the time you actually spend on line.
<br>
<br>
For callers to the U.S., there's more good news.  The <i>new</i> Right Plan has absorbed IT&E's Discover America rates to the fifty states - 
allowing a continuance of a 20 cents per minute rate everyday from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. and all weekend long from 5 p.m. Friday to 5 a.m. Monday.
<br>
<br>
The <i>new</i> Right Plan rates are available at the customer service counters at any IT&E sattelite office and at the IT&E main office
in Tamuning.<BR></td></table></center>

        <p>Holidays are supposed to be a joyful time of good
        cheer and optimistic hopes. Yet, it is not unusual for
        many of us to feel sad or lonely during the holiday
        period -- a condition that has come to be called <font
        color="#000080"><em><strong>holiday blues</strong></em></font>
        or <font color="#000080"><em><strong>holiday depression</strong></em></font>. </p>
        <p>Holiday depression may occur at any holiday or
        vacation time, but most commonly happens during the <font
        color="#000000">December holidays</font> when, it may
        seem, just about everyone in the world is celebrating in
        some way. There are many <a href="causes.htm">causes for
        holiday blues</a>, and the <a href="symptoms.htm">symptoms</a>
        may mimic clinical depression. <img
        src="images/cane012.gif" align="right" hspace="2"
        vspace="2" width="97" height="150"> </p>
        <p>While they may be intense and unsettling, holiday
        blues are usually short-lived, lasting for a few days to
        a few weeks prior to or just after the holiday. The good
        news is, <font color="#000000">holiday blues usually
        subside after the holiday season is over</font> and daily
        routines are resumed. </p>
        <p>There is a long list of recommended <a
        href="dodont.htm">Dos and Don'ts</a> for managing your
        holiday blues. The most important things to remember are:
        it's a normal response to a stress-filled time of the
        year, and you don't have to suffer unnecessarily. Find
        someone to talk with who can help you through this
        difficult time -- a family member, friend, member of the
        clergy, or <a href="../diabetes/teleserve.htm">a physician or
        professional counselor</a>. </p>
        <p>Holiday blues, although serious, should not be
        confused with another condition called <a href="sad.htm">Seasonal
        Affective Disorder</a>, which is a clinically diagnosed
        mood disorder that usually occurs during the winter
        months. </p>

<title>Methodist Scoop - Adults Need Inoculations, Too</title>                <body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">               <!--body bgcolor=#ffffff><center><img src=/methodist/scoop/scoop.jpg><h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b> Adults Need Inoculations, Too</b></font><hr size=6></h1></center><p>Anyone whos ever stood along the sidelines of a football field subscribes to the wisdom , The best offense is a good defense.  Thats good advice for those sitting in the stands, too.<p>Were acutely award of the schedule for child immunizations, but not too many adults know they also need regular inoculations, says Fran Slater, a nurse who is assistant manager of the Infection Control department of The Methodist Hospital.<p>American adults, particularly those over age 65, are dying at an alarming rate from diseases that could have been prevented by common vaccines.  Infections and complications caused by pneumonia and influenza claim about 80,000 lives each year.  Many otherwise healthy young adults are hospitalized or die from hepatitis B, measles, tetanus and other preventable infectious diseases.<p>Fall kicks off the beginning of the traditional flu season, so check out these stats:</ul><li> influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce hospitalization for flue and pneumonia by 48 to 57 percent;<li> flu shots also account for a 27 to 39 percent reduction in hospitalization for all acute and chronic respiratory conditions; and <li> some managed care companies report annual direct savings of up to $117 for every person vaccinated against the flu.</ul>Generally, flu shots are recommended for those who are most likely to contract the flu, including everyone over age 65; adults and children with long-term heart or lung problems; people who live or work in health care facilities or nursing homes; and those who have serious medical conditions (kidney disease, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, etc.) for which they are under close medical supervision.<p>But it doesn't hurt to get a flue shot before the season starts, no matter how old or sick you are.  Some people believe that an immunization will actually give them the flu -- that's not true.<p>"If you become ill after a flue shot, that means you may already have had a virus in your system," says Slater.  "The influenza vaccine contains only inactivated, or non-infected, viruses.  They can take up to two weeks to develop the antibodies most adults need to protect them from the flu"  Adults should also receive a tetanus/diphtheria (Td) booster every 10 years.  Tetanus, a disease caused by bacterial infection, usually enters the body through puncture wounds.<p>Finally, for certain persons, an immunization against hepatitis B is a good idea.  A debilitating and sometimes lethal liver infection, hepatitis B is transmitted by any behavior in which a person's mucous membranes or broken skin are exposed to blood, semen, vaginal secretions or saliva from someone who is infected.  The disease is actually more infectious than HIV, because household partners of infected people can become infected as well as sexual partners.<p>High-risk groups for the hepatitis B virus are workers and students in the health care professions; heterosexual and homosexual sexually active persons; IV drug users; natives of Alaska, the Pacific Islands, Asia, or Africa; and people who are sexual or household partners of identified carriers.<p>Slater says a family physician or public health facility can provide immunizations for influenza, tetanus/diphtheria and hepatitis B.  In Houston, call the city's Health and Human Services Department at 794-9181 to find out what clinics are giving immunizations.<p>When combined with a routine of regular medical checkups and tests, immunizations are indeed the best defense, and can keep you in the game for a long time.<p><center><hr size=4><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

<title>Methodist Scoop - Astronauts</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">                               <!--body bgcolor=#ffffff><center><img src=/methodist/scoop/scoop.jpg><h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b> Astronauts, Cosmonauts Undergo Tests at Methodist Following Historic Mission </b></font><hr size=6></h1></center><p>Since the 1960s, the U.S. space program has led the world in space exploration and showcased the skill, dedication, and courage of its scientists and astronauts.  The recent linkup of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Russian Mir space station, along with the movie retelling of the Apollo 13 flight, have brought the unearthly heroics of these men and women back into public consciousness. <PBut while the public is drawn to the dramatic stories of human spirit, scientific achievement, teamwork, and international cooperation, they often overlook the more mundane - but extremely important - medical testing that is a significant part of each space mission.<p>For years the Texas Medical Center and The Methodist Hospital have been involved in medical research for NASA, and most recently, Methodist had a hand in the historic Atlantis/Mir mission completed in June.<p>Following years of preparation and, for some of the astronauts and cosmonauts, months in space, the space explorers are coming to Methodist to undergo a number of tests that will help determine how space travel - particularly weightlessness - affects the human body.<p>	When people go into space, the lack of gravity has profound physical effects.  Bone and muscle loss, which on Earth are caused by disuse, are some of the results of living in zero gravity for weeks or months at a time.<p>"Though the astronauts exercise in space," says Adrian LeBlanc, Ph.D., a medical physicist at Methodist, "it isn't sufficient to counteract the effects of weightlessness.  It's important to know not only what causes the loss, but also what can be done to regain bone and muscle back on Earth."<p>LeBlanc and Tom Hedrick, MD, a radiologist at Methodist, are using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the expansion of intervertebral discs and changes in the leg and back muscles.  <p>LeBlanc also serves as co-investigator for test carried out at NASA to measure the decrease in bone mineral density of astronauts during the flight and the rate of recovery back on Earth.  In addition, the researchers are investigating how MRI can be used as a tool to study bone structure.<p>	Such research has important implications to the earthbound.  "These tests can help us understand and ultimately treat bone and muscle loss in the elderly, particularly as they relate to disuse," LeBlanc says.<p>	Similar tests are conducted on people who don't travel through the solar system for a living.  To experience conditions comparable to weightlessness, these terrestrials are required to stay in bed for up to 120 days at a time.<p>	The unique environment provided by the space program has led to some important medical breakthroughs, including the development of implantable defibrillators, similar to pacemakers, and the digital imaging technologies used in CAT and MRI.  LeBlanc adds that NASA has contributed to the development of bone densitometry, which is widely used in the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis.<p>	The Atlantis/Mir mission, which took LeBlanc to Russia to work with scientists and cosmonauts there, is not his first project with NASA; he was also involved in the Apollo and Sky Lab missions.<p>	In his experiences, LeBlanc has found the astronauts to be "all-American men and women - bright, motivated, and enthusiastic about what they do."<p>But he adds that they always seem to be glad to be back on Earth, especially after longer missions like Atlantis/Mir, which kept one American and two Russians in space for approximately four months.<p>Even a few days in space can cause significant changes in the body.  Astronauts become tired and the way they move is affected because the muscles one uses on Earth may not be the same muscles used in a weightless state.  LeBlanc is especially interested to examine the results of astronaut Norman Thagard's four month stay aboard Mir.<p>"It will be interesting to see what the physiological changes are after four months away from Earth," he says.<p>LeBlanc also notes that the astronauts are more than willing to aid in medical research, but sometimes want to know why they're being asked to undergo certain tests.  "They don't regard themselves as guinea pigs.  You have to convince them of the safety and significance of some procedures," he adds.<p>	Despite this occasional wariness about specific tests, the astronauts recognize the overall importance of medical research in space.<p>	"As the only governmental agency conducting human exploration in space, NASA is in the unique position to invest in advanced engineering and medical technology," LeBlanc says.  "Methodist is proud to contribute to NASA's medical research project".

<title>Methodist Scoop - Cardiac Evaluation Unit</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">   <!--body bgcolor=#ffffff><center><img src=/methodist/scoop/scoop.jpg><h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b>Cardiac Evaluation Unit Brings Peace of Mind to Doctors and Patients </b></font><hr size=6></h1></center><p>There are probably more enjoyable ways to spend 12 hours than as a patient in Methodist's emergency room, but many patients and physicians are finding that a short stay in the Emergency Department's Cardiac Evaluation Unit (CEU) can save time, money, and possibly lives.<p>	Before the CEU was established in November 1994, ER patients experiencing heart attack symptoms usually had two options:  to be sent to a cardiac care unit (CCU) for a minimum of 24 hours, or to be sent home although their conditions may have been more serious than originally thought.  Physicians often faced the dilemma of providing too much care in the CCU or too little by discharging the patient.<p>	The Cardiac Evaluation Unit has eliminated those difficult choices, offering an intermediate care setting that allows for more complete patient evaluations by physicians before they decide to admit or discharge a patient.<p>	Because Methodist is  known as an excellent cardiac care hospital, its emergency room is the first choice for many people who think they are having heart attacks.  Each day, Emergency Department employees see patients experiencing chest pains and other heart attack symptoms.  Only about one-third of those people, however, are actually having heart attacks; the others may be suffering from any number of problems, including unstable angina, embolisms, or pulmonary or gastrointestinal ailments.  <p>	In the past, physicians would make a fairly rapid evaluation in the ER and, with just a preliminary "snapshot", decide whether it was safe to send a patient home or if he or she needed to be admitted to the CCU for further observation.  Often, neither seemed like a perfect plan.  While the doctor may have wanted the patient to undergo more tests, an expensive stay in the CCU may not have been warranted.  On the other hand, nobody wanted to risk the possibly tragic consequences of premature discharge.<p>	The monitored beds of the Cardiac Evaluation Unit, located within the Emergency Room, have reduced that risk, allowing physicians to observe patients for up to 24 hours, though most CEU stays generally last between six and 12 hours.  In that time, caregivers can learn enough about a patient's health to make an appropriate, unhurried decision.<p>In observing CEU patients, caregivers often use a relatively new process developed by Methodist cardiologists.  The CK subforms test is a procedure that looks at a person's enzymes to see if a heart attack has occurred.  Similar tests used to take six to 12 hours; the CK subforms test takes as little as four hours for diagnosis.<p>	In addition to the test, CEU staff also take into account patient history and EKG readings.  With these and other indicators, caregivers can get a relatively complete picture of a patient's health in a short period of time. <p>"Physicians like the idea that they can observe a patient and make a decision based on more than just a preliminary snapshot," says Robert Fromm, M.D., Chief of Emergency Services at Methodist.<p>	"Patients like it, too," adds Johnie Leonard, R.N., Manager of the Emergency Department.  "They feel comfortable being discharged if they've had an opportunity to be observed first." <p>	Patients also appreciate the difference in price.  Bed space alone in the cardiac care unit is $1,000 a day.  A few hours in the CEU is considerably less, and it was with cost savings and increased efficiency in mind that the unit was created.<p>"There are tremendous cost-saving advantages and decreases in unnecessary admissions.  The unit can reduce the burden on the CCU and telemetry units in the hospital," says Leonard.<p>	The CEU is now seeing approximately six patients a week, though Leonard says it can handle a greater capacity.  "We're hoping that doctors will use it more and more, especially with the current ICU bed crunch."<p>For more information contact <!a href=mailto:webmaster@methodist.com>webmaster@methodist.com</a><center><hr size=4><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

<title>Methodist Scoop - Felix</title>                               <body bgcolor=#ffffff><center><img src=/methodist/scoop/scoop.jpg><h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b>Felix the Feline Therapist is a Hit with Patients </b></font><hr size=6></h1></center><p>Happy Birthday, Felix...He's the black and white feline therapist at the hospital's Rehabilitation Center.  June 21 was his birthday, or his assigned birthday by Center employees, because that's the day Felix was approved by the Infection Control Committee to live (and work) in the Rehab Center.<p>	"We know he's about five years old," says Denise Mosgrove, CRT specialist, who was instrumental in bringing Felix to Methodist.  "We got him from Teri Boyd's kennel in Tomball after his owner had to give him up due to a family transfer.  Now he acts like he owns the place.  Everyone loves Felix; he's sort of famous.  People will see him and say hi to him before they'll say hi to the person walking him on his leash.  Elevator passengers have asked me, 'is that Felix?'  He's even done an interview on KIKK about the use of animals in patient therapy.  He was mobbed."<p>Specifically, while on his job, Felix will help patients become more comfortable expressing their feelings, show and receive some attention and affection, even work with motor skills by playing games with him.<p>"The Kitty Teaser is what we call the fishing game because it looks like a fishing pole and patients cast and move the pole to involve Felix," says Mosgrove.  "Many patients will use cognitive processing to develop a strategy to play the game with Felix."<p>	Felix's house is the large room called "Therapeutic Recreation."  He prefers to sleep in a chair or on a pool table.  In the mornings he takes his walk down the hallways to visit patients.  Early afternoon is his rest time, then late afternoon he's on the prowl with patients again.<p>And Felix has been know to get into some mischief.<p>"He used to open up all the cabinets every night," says Mosgrove, still smiling.  "And then there was the time he jumped into the basketball free throw game we have set up for patients and brought it crashing down."  Take that, Shaq.<p>Felix also managed to get behind the wheel of the rehab car in the Center's gym area.  He crawled through a lowered window and was ready to go joy riding with Toonces, but was discovered before he could figure out that the Taurus has no tires.<p>Felix's innovative role at the Center is part of a program called animal-assisted therapy, dating back to 1792 at the York Retreat in England.  Almost a century later, in 1897, Germany used animals to help treat epileptic patients.  In the U.S., Boris Levinson in 1958 began using his dog Jingles to help disturbed children.  Now there is even an award named after Jingles given each year to a dog who has done an exceptional job of helping in patient therapy.<p>By the way, Felix loves visitors, but isn't permitted outside the Rehab Center on main 5.  Weekends are spent with staff members.<p>"Felix has turned a lot of people into cat lovers around here," says Mosgrove.  "We have a long list of people offering to take him if we ever had to do that.  We'd prefer that it remain just a wish list.  He's pretty lovable."<p>For more information contact <!a href=mailto:webmaster@methodist.com>webmaster@methodist.com</a><center><hr size=4><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

<title>Methodist Scoop - ICU</title>                               <body bgcolor=#ffffff><center><img src=/methodist/scoop/scoop.jpg><h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b> New Fondren ICU Design Includes Patient Suggestions </b></font><hr size=6></h1></center><p>When it came time to refurbish a key intensive care unit (ICU) at The Methodist Hospital, the unit's head nurse enlisted the advice of experts.<p>Nurse Fe Cuano talked to doctors, nurses, ward clerks and nursing assistants on what features the new unit should have.  But most important, she sought the advice of patients.<p>Nearly three years later, Cuano helped cut the ribbon to officially re-open her nursing unit in the Fondren-Brown building at Methodist and welcomed 10 patients to the unit on its first working day.<p>Cuano is head nurse of the cardio-thoracic ICU, where patients recover from major thoracic surgeries such as cardiovascular and transplant procedures.  Cuano and her staff are happy with the new unit, which opened June 19, because they know it was refurbished from the ceiling tiles down according to their own specifications.<p>"Although the renovation work on the old Fondren ICU started in November of last year, the actual planning goes back to 1992," she says.  'And an important part of it was tracking patient comments over the years to see what features we could incorporate into a new unit."<p>So those who attended the June 16 grand opening saw a sparkling 30-bed unit boasting state-of-the-art monitoring and support equipment in brighter, more colorful surroundings.<p>One patient-friendly touch is the inclusion of some stained-glass lighting fixtures in the unit's rooms.  "That was something we heard from patients - that we needed artwork" says Cuano.  "We told that to the architects and they came up with that suggestion."<p>Nurses also suggested to the designers that ceiling tiles over patient beds should be plain, with no design cut into them.  Patients coming out of anesthesia or who were bedridden for long periods told nurses when they stared at the old unit's ceiling, the designs in the tiles turned into "ants" that crawled.<p>"So we made sure that the tiles over the beds are plain," says Cuano, "but they have the typical designs in the hallway ceilings for those who like that kind of thing."<p>On a unit that cost approximately $5.5 million to renovate, Cuano concedes those are minor touches.  But they are important to patient satisfaction, and therefore important to the unit's planners.  "Everything on this unit," she adds, "emphasizes patient satisfaction."<p>The old ICU - built in 1965 - had 49 beds and problems with patient crowding.  What were 10-bed units in the old ICU were turned into six-bed wards to allow for more space.<p>Each bed has a bedside computer terminal for "paperless" record keeping and timely updating of patients information.  Closed circuit TV cameras over each bed allow nurses to keep around-the-clock eye on patients, and six glassed-in-rooms allow for pressure control and maximum visibility to nursing staff.<p>This renovation was a bit more complicated than most, because a number of other projects had to be completed before the ICU opened.  These included the installation of a new generator in the Fondren building, replacement of medical gas systems, and the construction of an exhaust system.<p>"It was a lot of work, but the end result was well worth it," says Cuano.  "Right now, I'm happy.

<title>Methodist Scoop - New Treatment for Brain Aneurysms</title>  <bodybgcolor=#ffffff><center><img src=/methodist/scoop/scoop.jpg>
<h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b>New Treatment for Brain Aneurysms</b></font><hr size=6></h1></center>
<P>
Physicians at The Methodist Hospital in Houston are now able to treat patients who have dangerous brain aneurysms using a platinum coil device.<BR>
<P>
The Guglielmi Detachable Coil (GDC) is the first product to receive market clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this type of treatment.<BR>
<P>
The Methodist Hospital was one of the 20 hospitals nationwide that participated in the GDC clinical trials prior to FDA market clearance.<BR>
<P>
Nearly 40,000 people in the United States are diagnosed each year with brain aneurysms.  In approximately 25 percent of these cases, the aneurysm is deemed either inoperable or at high risk for surgical repair due to its location, anatomy, and/or the overall medical condition of the patient.<BR>
<P>
"This new technology offers hope to patients who risk losing their lives due to ruptured aneurysms that can cause hemorrhagic stroke," said Dr. Michel E. Mawad, director of Neuroradiology at The Methodist Hospital and principal investigator in the clinical trials.<BR>
<P>
Intracranial aneurysms are weak, balloon-like defects that protrude from arterial walls within the brain.  They can rupture, causing death or serious disability or can cause symptoms such as severe headache and dizziness when non-ruptured.<BR>
<P>
According to the National Stroke Association, stroke is the nation's third leading cause of death, resulting in 150,000 deaths every year.  Stroke risk increases with age, with the risk doubling after age 55.  For adults over age 65, the risk of dying from stroke is seven times that of the general population.<BR>
<P>
The GDC is a soft platinum alloy micro-coil that is delivered to the aneurysm site by a micro-catheter in a controlled manner.  It is detached and released into the aneurysm by application of a very low voltage electrical current.  Once in place, the GDC coil fills the aneurysm, isolating it from circulation and thereby reducing the likelihood of a rupture and hemorrhagic stroke.<BR>
<P>
"The GDC is a significant step forward in the development of new techniques to fight stroke," said Gary Houser, vice president of the National Stroke Association.  "A new paradigm of care is emerging for the treatment of neurological disease leading to stroke.  This includes the development of innovative new therapies such as the Guglielmi Detachable Coil, thrombolytic drugs, and neuroprotective compounds."<BR>
<P>
GDC coils have been used to treat approximately 1,200 people in the United States under an investigational device exemption.  Approximately 4,600 patients were treated outside the United States as well.  And Mawad has treated over 200 patients at The Methodist Hospital in Houston.<BR>

<title>Methodist Scoop - Methodists Bone Marrow Program Receives Accreditation for Non-Related Donors, Too</title>

<font size=+3><b> Methodists Bone Marrow Program Receives Accreditation for Non-Related Donors
</b></font>
<hr size=6></h1></center><p>
</font>

The Methodist Hospitals Bone Marrow program has recently received accreditation from the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) to perform marrow transplants between patients and donors who are not related.
<p>
The NMDP maintains a registry of volunteers willing to be marrow donors.  This network includes more than 70 transplant centers throughout the United States.  Each center must meet strict guidelines to be approved as a NMDP site.
<p>
Methodist has the only program in Houston to be accredited for all three components of the transplant process -- donor registration, donor collection and transplants from unrelated donors.
<p>
There are basically two types of marrow transplants:  autologous and allogenic.
<p>
Autologous marrow transplants involve removing a portion of the patients own marrow, storing it and returning it to the patient after the patient undergoes high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation.
<p>
Allogenic marrow transplants use marrow from a person other than the patient.  A donor can be a family member or someone unrelated to the patient. 
<p>
Approximately 30 percent of those considering a transplant will find a matched donor within their families.  If a match with a relative is unsuccessful, then a nationwide search begins for a volunteer whose marrow matches the patients.
<p>
The chances of finding an unrelated donor vary widely, depending on the rarity of the patients tissue type.  However, once a match is found, that volunteers marrow may be the only lifesaving option for the patient.
<p>
In many cases, unrelated donor marrow transplants offer the only possible cure for many fatal blood diseases.
<p>
For more information on Methodists Blood and Marrow Program, call 713/790-3969.  To learn about being listed by the NMDP as a potential volunteer bone marrow donor, call 713/790-3127.

<title>Methodist Scoop - Midwives</title>                               <body bgcolor=#ffffff><center><img src=/methodist/scoop/scoop.jpg><h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b>Midwives Lend High-Touch Technique to Birth Process </b></font><hr size=6></h1></center><p>   	When she was a labor and delivery nurse at Methodist, Nell Sagehorn was accustomed to seeing women surrounded by doctors, nurses, and state-of-the-art technology when it came time to have a baby.<p>	So when it was time for Nell to have her first child, she used one of the most advanced high-tech instruments available today - the telephone.<p>	During her 12-hour labor Nell frequently talked over the phone with a nurse-midwife.  She advised Nell on how much to walk, whether or not to eat, how much to sleep.  Then when it was time to deliver the baby, the nurse-midwife met Nell and her doctor at the hospital and stayed with Nell until the birth of her son.<p>	Nell chose a "low-tech" route to have her baby because she wanted to have the experience naturally.  That was possible because she employed a certified nurse-midwife from a new service currently available at Methodist.<p>	Operated by Women's Specialists of Houston, the service is the first private-practice midwifery program to be given delivery privileges at a Texas Medical Center hospital.  The group includes two certified nurse-midwives, Audrey McCuyer and Mavis Schorn, and four board-certified obstetrician/gynecologists:  Mark Gottesman, MD; Meredith Morgan, MD; Terry Simon, MD; and Edward Yosowitz, MD.  Another midwifery program sponsored by Baylor College of Medicine has been in place at Methodist since 1991.<p>	At first Sagehorn wanted to have a conventional hospital-doctor delivery.  But she changed her mind after consulting with Gottesman.<p>	"I realized that I would get much more if a nurse-midwife worked with my doctor on the delivery," Sagehorn recalls.  "I decided I wanted the experience of a natural childbirth with a nurse-midwife...I heard it said that a doctor is high-tech, but a midwife is high-touch."<p>	Sagehorn met with nurse-midwife Mavis Schorn on a routine prenatal visit to her doctor's office.  Schorn followed the progress of Sagehorn and her baby, and when Sagehorn finally went into labor she called the nurse-midwife.<p>	Schorn and Gottesman worked as a team in the delivery room.  "It's called 'co-managing' the pregnancy and delivery," says Schorn, who has been a certified nurse-midwife for five years.  "The nurse-midwife takes the mother through the routine parts of labor and delivery, and an obstetrician is available to handle high--risk cases or difficult deliveries."<p>	"Our approach is to help the human body do what it is naturally supposed to do during childbirth," says Schorn.<p>	Because nurse-midwives help and coach a mother in labor, some fathers may think their role during childbirth may be limited.<p>	"We just try to help him help her," explains Schorn.  "We're not there to take his place."<p>	Sagehorn agrees.  'Mavis helped me by making suggestions about changing position, walking, things like that," she says.  "My husband was still very important in coaching me through the whole process."  <p>The practice of midwifery, or assisting in a childbirth, has been around for centuries.  Midwives handle low-risk deliveries of mothers with no serious medical problems.  They spend a lot of time with women before delivery, educating them about diet, exercise, and prenatal care.  They help women through the birth process, helping to coach the mother during labor and making sure the baby is healthy.  And midwives conduct postnatal care for both mother and child.<p>	Midwives are nurse practitioners, which are nurses with advanced degrees and specialized training.  At Methodist, approved midwives can admit patients to the hospital.  <p>	Midwifery is one of the most steadily growing nurse practitioner fields in the country.  There are approximately 3,900 female and male midwives in clinical practice in the United States.  All of them are certified by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.<p>	The growing trend has in some cases threatened physicians who believe only medical doctors can give the proper care to pregnant women.<p>	"I believe that working with midwives has made me a better clinician." says Gottesman.  "The idea of midwives may conjure up images of your great-grandmother delivering babies at home, and patients may worry that they'll receive less care if they see a midwife.  But once they meet the nurse midwives we work with, patients realize it's enhanced care with more depth than I can provide alone."<p>	At the Women's Specialists of Houston, patients who wish to work with a nurse-midwife see the midwife on their initial obstetrical visit.  Because nurse-midwives can have longer, more personalized visits, Gottesman says the mother can get more information she can use.<p>	"Then, as the pregnancy progresses, patient and midwife work together for routine pre-natal care," he continues.  "Unless it's a high-risk pregnancy or one with any kind of medical complications, the physician may see the patient just a few times until the delivery."	Gottesman says the new midwifery program is modeled after an Atlanta program with a very high successful labor and delivery record.<p>	"Each clinician brings something very valuable to the birth experience," he adds.  For the patient, it's a win-win situation."<p> For more information contact <!a href=mailto:webmaster@methodist.com>webmaster@methodist.com</a><center><hr size=4><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

<title>Methodist Scoop - Mother</title>                               <body bgcolor=#ffffff><center><img src=/methodist/scoop/scoop.jpg><h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b> One Mother's Message is her Son's Legacy </b></font><hr size=6></h1></center><p>	Teri Medina always had high hopes for her son Frank.  She figured he'd do something important someday, something that would help people.<p>One good sign was the sense of responsibility that 15-year-old Frank apparently had - he took a job at a McDonald's so he could buy his own car insurance.<p>	But one night, robbers forced their way into the restaurant after it had closed.  They beat Frank with baseball bats.  Medina rushed to Methodist, where Frank was taken, and stayed with her son until he was declared brain dead 12 days later.<p>Nearly a year later Medina stood before a large crowd in Methodist's Wiess Chapel and told them her son is changing people's lives, like she always thought he would.<p>"Three people benefited from Frank's organs," said Medina, a mother of four.  "I heard from one of them, a middle-aged woman named Patsy who received a kidney transplant.  She told me 'I can go grocery shopping again.'"<p>Medina joined others who shared their stories at the annual Service of Thanksgiving and Remembrance at Methodist, held April 19 as part of Organ and Tissue Donation Awareness Week.  And like Medina's, some of these were stories of mothers and their children.<p>Bobbie Schaefer came to the ceremony and told people about her son.  He was accepted into the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis one day before he was killed in an accident.<p>"His eye test for Annapolis showed he had perfect vision," Schaefer remembered.  "He told me if anything ever happened to him, make sure those ol' peepers went to somebody who needed them.  And his corneas are helping someone to see right now."<p>	Even though the list of people who need organ transplants is growing, the chronic shortage of organs is growing worse.  One reason is that most Americans still do not understand the process of organ donation, according to Pat McCue, assistant manager of Methodist's Multi-Organ Transplant Center.<p>"Because of that, the responsibility of health care professionals to inform families of potential donors about the process of organ donation becomes even more acute," she said.<p>Figures supplied by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) show that, by the end of February, 38,364 patients were on waiting lists for organs nationwide.<p>But less than half will actually receive a transplant because on the average fewer than 5,000 people donate organs each year.  And since some donors supply more than one organ, approximately 15,000 people receive transplants annually.<p>There are many ways to learn about transplantation and organ donation.  Call the Methodist Multi-Organ Transplant Center at 790-2501 to find out more about transplants.  For more information on organ donation, call LifeGift at 799-9115, or UNOS at 1-800-24-DONOR.<p> For more information contact <!a href=mailto:webmaster@methodist.com>webmaster@methodist.com</a><center><hr size=4><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

<title>Methodist Scoop - Rhodes</title>                               <body bgcolor=#ffffff><center><img src=/methodist/scoop/scoop.jpg><h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b> Rhodes' Typical Day Becomes a Piece of American History </b></font><hr size=6></h1></center><p>	Lisa Rhodes never thought she'd be singled out for being typical, but that's exactly what happened when she was asked to join 22 other women from across the United States in celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Women's Bureau of the U.S. Department of Labor.<p>	On May 19 Rhodes, an EEG technologist at Methodist, and the other working women became a part of history when tokens of their daily lives were preserved in a time capsule at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.<p>	The time capsule, called "Voices of Working Women," will be opened in the year 2020, on the 100th anniversary of the Women's Bureau.  The women submitted photos, narratives, and objects that tell something about their typical workdays.<p>Rhodes is the only woman from Texas included in the anniversary celebration.  She sent photos of herself on the job, performing EEGs on babies less than one month old for a research project, and other symbols of her work including a set of electrodes, and an EEG tracing.<p>She also sent pictures of herself at home with her family and, like the others represented in the time capsule, a letter to future working women and a journal of her day.  Rhodes says writing the journal was one of the most interesting parts of the project and it made her realize how much she accomplishes in a single day.<p>	"My day begins," she wrote, "with a sputter at 5 a.m., when I let our dog outside.  I then cuddle with my children, hoping it is Saturday.  The odds are against me...My uniform is a set of green scrubs...My husband will call me around 7:30 a.m. to make sure I am awake.  We are very fortunate that our child care provider lives across the street.  I leave my children in a loving and stimulating environment.  This enables me to feels secure about my desire to work."<p>Rhodes modestly says she was chosen simply because she met certain demographics - as the anniversary date grew closer, the Bureau needed a representative from Texas, as well as a Hispanic and a working mother, she says.  <p>Eli Mizrahi, MD, Rhodes' clinical supervisor, indirectly learned about the project and nominated Rhodes for the honor.<p>Because she was selected only a few weeks before the ceremony, Rhodes acted quickly to get everything together for the time capsule.  So the prestige of begin chosen to represent not only Texas but also the health care industry didn't immediately sink in.<p>"In the beginning it was all so bizarre and funny, I really didn't realize the impact it would have," she says.  "Then I was talking to my husband about it and thought, 'Oh my God, this is going to be in the Smithsonian!'"<p>At first Rhodes was unaware of who would also be contributing to the project.  "When I heard that is was only 23 women, I thought, 'Wow, that's a lot.'"<p>Despite their relatively few numbers, the participants come from a wide variety of careers and backgrounds.  In addition to Rhodes, there are teachers, truck drivers, ministers, farmers and the CEO of Paramount Pictures.  Although Rhodes couldn't go to the presentation at the White House, she is proud and excited that her daily achievements - however "typical" they may be - have earned her a place in history.  <p> <center><hr size=4><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

<title>Methodist Scoop - Telemed</title>                               <body bgcolor=#ffffff><center><img src=/methodist/scoop/scoop.jpg><h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b>The Future of Medicine, Coming to a Television Screen Near You </b></font><hr size=6></h1></center><p>When urologist Peter Scardino scrubbed for a morning operation Wednesday, he was preparing for a routine prostatectomy.  But for 800 physicians gathered on the other side of the world, it was a major event.<p>The surgery from Methodist's Main 3 OR Wednesday was beamed via satellite to a meeting of the Italian Urologic Society.  The doctors, gathered in Rome, saw Scardino remove a cancerous prostate gland on live television and were able to talk to the surgeon while he performed the procedure.<p>When he was able to divert his attention from the surgery, Scardino could also see the physicians as he answered their questions over a second satellite hookup.  <p>This is the future of medicine - interactive video that has moved from the game room to the operating room.  Telemedicine, as it is called, is still in its infancy but when the practice becomes common it could revolutionize health care.<p>"This is the future of medicine," says Michael DeBakey, MD, senior attending surgeon at Methodist and chancellor of Baylor College of Medicine.  "It will extend our reach to virtually any place on Earth."<p>Although satellite communications technology has been available for decades, telemedicine has been slow to develop until now.  DeBakey thinks that one reason has been that, until recent years, doctors and hospitals were unwilling to participate in something that seemed extremely expensive.<p>"Technology has improved to the point where equipment is miniaturized and fairly standard," he explains.  "Now it's economically feasible to participate in telemedicine because it makes effective health care available to more people"	In 1965, DeBakey participated in the first intercontinental two-way broadcast of a heart surgery.  He did it partially to demonstrate the features of "Early Bird," the country's first commercial communications satellite, and partially to show the possibilities of telemedicine.  <p>Scardino, chief of Urology at Methodist and Baylor, believes that intercontinental exchanges such as his surgery this week will help take medical knowledge to new places.  "The Italians, for example, haven't traditionally treated prostate cancer with surgical methods," he explains.  "So this is a way to show them the most modern techniques in a very efficient way."<p>Wouldn't it be easier to just fly to Italy and perform a prostatectomy their?<p>"In the first place, 800 people wouldn't be able to see it because we couldn't fit them all into the operating room," replies Scardino.  "We'd still have to put it on television, probably over a closed-circuit system, to get the same result."<p>Scardino adds that having the patient, surgeon, staff, and conditions here at Methodist is the best way to show the proper methods.  "Because they're not used to the surgery, you're not going to have the facilities and staff on hand to recreate those ideal conditions," he says.<p>With DeBakey's help, private companies as well as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have collaborated to build a special telemedicine station at Methodist and Baylor.<p>The Medtel system is a video/computer linkup that will allow doctors here to communicate with, examine, and diagnose patients anywhere in the world.  A control center in DeBakey's Alkek Tower offices allows for linkup to the distant sites.<p>Initially, a special examination room was set up at Methodist, equipped with cameras and other diagnostic equipment that were operated by doctors in other areas for simulated testing of the equipment.<p>DeBakey says this system is more than just two-way video and audio communications and connection.  State-of-the-art electronics enable doctors to transmit and receive computerized information over telephone lines, as well as microwave and satellite links.<p>"Using the system we can instantaneously receive or send all sorts of information, such as an EKG or a blood pressure reading," he adds.  "And the video quality is so good that we could study X-rays over the system or even visually assess a patient's condition if we need to."<p>The Medtel system is privately owned and operated, and doctors or hospitals who wish to use it would make financial arrangements with the company that owns the system.<p>The procedure this week with Scardino did not utilize the Medtel system.  Satellite dishes and equipment from a number of outside companies made the connection possible.<p>DeBakey says telemedicine can eventually benefit remote areas where specialists are sparse, and can extend the reach of teaching institutions which can train doctors and technicians in other countries.  A setup like the Medtel system could also eventually be used by NASA to perform medical examinations on astronauts in a U.S. space station.<p>"We haven't even begun to consider all of the uses of telemedicine," says DeBakey.  "The possibilities are endless." <p> For more information contact <!a href=mailto:webmaster@methodist.com>webmaster@methodist.com</a><center><hr size=4><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

<h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b>Facts About The Methodist Hospital</b></font><hr size=6></h1></font>
</center>The best care and service -- that has long been the mission of The Methodist 
Hospital System in Houston.  For 75 years, we have served our community, 
providing outstanding <a href=/methodist/about/facts.htm#medical>patient care</a>, 
<a href=/methodist/about/facts.htm#research> education and research</a> in a 
<a href=/methodist/about/facts.htm#spiritual>spiritual 
environment</a> of caring.  Generations of patients have seen us grow from a 30-bed 
facility into a modern health care system housing one of the largest, private, 
<a href=/methodist/about/comm.htm>non-profit</a> hospitals in the country.
<p>Today, The Methodist Hospital is a 1,527-bed, 
acute care complex located in Houston's world-renowned Texas Medical Center.  
It is one of the largest private, non-profit hospitals in the United States, and is staffed 
by more than 4,000 professionals and support personnel.  The Hospital serves more 
than 100,000 individuals annually from across the country and around the world.<p>In recent years, Methodist has been listed by <i>U.S. News & World Report</i> magazine 
as one of the best hospitals in the United States, with <a href=/methodist/ailing/Cardio.htm>cardiology</a>, 
<a href=/methodist/ailing/Oto.htm>otolaryngology</a>, 
and <a href=/methodist/ailing/Urology.htm>urology</a>
 services highlighted as among the best in the nation.  Methodist has 
also received the "Commitment to Quality" Award, the only national award 
recognizing quality in health care.<p>Through the Methodist Health Care Network, 
Inc., a member of The Methodist Hospital System, Methodist is affiliated with select 
health care institutions in the United States, Latin America, Europe, and the Middle 
East.

<p><b>Patient Care</b><p>As an internationally known specialty referral center, the
 Hospital in 1994 served approximately 9,300 inpatients and 81,000 outpatients
 from all 50 states and more than 80 countries.  The Hospital performs nearly one
 million outpatient procedures annually.<p>The Methodist Hospital has long been
 famous for its innovations in cardiology and cardiovascular surgery, and is the 
home of famed heart surgeon Dr. Michael E. DeBakey. <p>Working with Baylor 
College of Medicine, the Hospital developed one of the largest transplant centers
 in the United States, the Multi-Organ Transplant Center, and is also known for its
 use of state-of-the-art technology and innovative diagnostic and surgical treatments
 for cancer and aneurysms.  <p>And, Methodist's high-quality, high-value patient 
care has been extended beyond Hospital walls through its affiliation with the 
Visiting Nurse Association, Inc., providing home health and hospice care.

<p><b>Education and Research</b><p>The Methodist Hospital is the primary adult 
teaching facility for Baylor College of Medicine, one of the nation's leading institutions 
of medical education and research.  All 827 members of the active medical 
staff hold concurrent faculty appointments at Baylor.  <p>Because of this 
affiliation, millions of dollars in research programs at Baylor and Methodist are
 translated directly into innovative patient care programs at Methodist. 
 Methodist also sponsors training programs for nursing as well as most of the
 allied health professions.<p>Major research facilities at Methodist include:<ul>
<li>The DeBakey Heart Center, which houses two federally designated Specialized 
Centers of Research dedicated to the study of heart failure and atherosclerosis; 
<li>One of three centers in the nation established for the study and treatment of
 Alzheimer's disease; 
<li>One of five of the nation's amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
 (ALS) clinics funded by the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA); 
<li>One of two centers in the nation to receive National Institutes of Health(NIH) 
designation for prostate cancer research; 
<li>One of two centers in the nation to
receive NIH funding for neonatal seizures; and 
<li>One of eight centers to receive
 NIH funding for epilepsy research.</ul>
<a name=spiritual>
<b>Pastoral Services</b><p>The chaplains at The
 Methodist Hospital provide one of the most important and lasting services for patients
 and their families:  the healing of the spirit.<p>Each day, the Hospital's Pastoral 
Services and Education chaplains visit about 260 patients and families.  The annual
 list stretches to about 70,000.  They are ready to help 24 hours a day, taking turns 
sleeping at the Hospital so they can ensure that help is always nearby.<p>In addition 
to their ministry of counseling in times of great stress and grief, the chaplains at
 Methodist teach their specialty to about 20 clergy, lay persons and seminarians 
each year.  One-year residency, nine-month externship and 12-week internship 
programs in clinical pastoral education are all offered at Methodist.<p>More than 
600 worship services are held at the Hospital each year for patients, visitors and 
employees.  Services are provided in the Christian, Jewish and Muslim faiths, and a 
variety of nondemoninational services are also held.  <p>The Wiess Memorial 
Chapel, named in honor of Elizabeth Carrothers Wiess, is the site of daily religious 
services.  The beautiful stained glass and quiet sanctity of the chapel offer patients
and visitors a place for private prayer and meditation.
